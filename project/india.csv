"Smriti props up ‘labharthis’, local connect to woo voters",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/smriti-props-up-labharthis-local-connect-to-woo-voters/articleshow/110221884.cms,"‘Amethi ki janata ne 2019 mein ek naya itihas racha tha. Is baar usi itihas ko dohrana hai (People of Amethi had scripted history in 2019. It is time to repeat it)’. This is how Union minister and BJP ’s candidate from Amethi Lok Sabha constituency Smriti Irani reminds voters how they helped her push Rahul Gandhi out of the Congress turf.For the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Irani got a psychological edge when the Bharatiya Janata Party named her in the first list as its candidate from Lok Sabha constituency, prompting her to roll out her poll campaign even before the election schedule could be announced.Losing no time, in Feb, Irani performed ‘grih pravesh’ of her house that she got constructed in Amethi and swiftly went into election mode, often daring Rahul to contest from Amethi. The Congress, however, maintained the suspense till the eleventh hour to name Kishori Lal Sharma, man Friday of Sonia Gandhi, as its candidate from Amethi.According to her associates, Irani meticulously draws her daily campaign plan and makes it a point to remain punctual. “She plans everything minutely – whom she will meet at home, office or on the field, and the places she will visit throughout the day,” a close aide says.“Interaction with cadres and her teams is the first thing with which she starts her day. She then meets journalists for interviews and heads to the field to attend public meetings, ‘nukkad sabhas’, and mass contact programmes,” he adds.Banking largely on the achievements and welfare schemes of the double engine govt, Smriti props up ‘labharthis’ (beneficiaries) while promising that those left out will get benefits in the next term. Aware of the fact that women voters hold the key to BJP’s prospects, the sitting MP goes an extra mile to connect with them at different levels.In the beginning of May, she participated in a local religious programme known as ‘Dukh duraiyan’ in which women pray to a goddess to remove all obstacles ahead of a key event.“Women in Awadh region have deep faith in this ritual and as their woman MP, Smriti Irani respected the desire of the local women to join them in the puja,” says Raj Lakshmi Tripathi of Vashishtha Peeth who led the ceremony. During her door-to-door campaign and ‘padyatras’ she makes a point to bond with women. In one such meeting at Anaaj Mandi trisection, she urges women to vote for BJP for a brighter and self-reliant future.Welcomed by residents with flowers, Smriti stops for interaction with them and reinforces her attack on the opponents. She reiterates that “fearing a repeat of 2019, the Gandhis have fled from Amethi and fielded a ‘nobody’ instead”.She gently reminds people how she helped Amethi get rid of the perennial problem of traffic jams by accelerating the flyover project. She also says that the bridge over Sai river made the people’s life easier.Irani also surprises voters by taking a scooter ride in the constituency. Recently, she decided to stop by at an eating joint.Locals say that they are enjoying the attention they are getting from their MP during election season. Some of them believe that the election would be a cakewalk for Irani while others feel that Congress’s Kishori Lal Sharma may pose a tough challenge to her. Others who maintain a neutral stance believe the prospects of both the parties are fluctuating and the result could go in favour of either of the two parties.","BJP’s candidate from Amethi Lok Sabha constituency Smriti Irani reminds voters how they helped her push Rahul Gandhi out of the Congress turf.

"Don't do pressers as media not neutral, says PM Modi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-do-pressers-as-media-not-neutral-says-pm-modi/articleshow/110187422.cms,"Brought new work culture, media’s call to endorse it or not: PM Modi

NEW DELHI: PM Modi on Thursday justified his decision not to hold press conferences by saying that the nature of media had changed and it was not the neutral entity that it used to be, with journalists promoting their views and ideologies.""I am answerable to Parliament.Today, journalists are identified with their own preferences. Media is no longer a non-partisan entity.People are now aware of your beliefs as well. Earlier, media used to be faceless... who is writing in the media, what is its ideology... nobody was bothered about it earlier. However, the situation is not the same any more,"" Modi said in an interview to Aaj Tak Hindi.The PM said a new culture had developed in politics which was centered on managing the media and not being concerned about performance. “However, I don’t believe in treading that path. I have to work hard and reach out to each household of the poor. I can also get clicked cutting ribbons in Vigyan Bhavan. However, I go to a small district in Jharkhand for a minor project. I have brought a new work culture and it is for the media to take a call whether they endorse it or not,” he said.Asked about allegations that Election Commission ’s independence had been compromised on his watch, Modi shot back by recalling instances of CECs taking to politics and holding ministerial positions after their retirement under Congress regimes and by pointing out that EC was a single-member entity for 56 years.“The funny thing is that people who came out of Election Commission sometimes became governors. Sometimes they became MPs. Sometimes they went to contest parliamentary elections against Advani ji, they are examples of people who served as chief election commissioner under previous governments. Election commissioners from that era, now retired, still tweet promoting the same political philosophy. They give their opinion and write articles. This only shows that it is only now that EC has become completely independent,” the PM said, a reference to former CEC T N Seshan contesting polls against L K Advani and M S Gill being nominated to Rajya Sabha and later becoming a Union minister under UPA regimes.In response to the opposition’s allegations that 400+ seats were meant to change the Constitution, Modi said, “Who was the first person to tamper with the Constitution in this country? It was Pandit Nehru. The amendments he brought were meant to restrict freedom of speech, which was against democracy and against the Constitution.”“After that, his daughter (Indira Gandhi) overturned a court judgment and imposed an Emergency. Rajiv Gandhi overturned Supreme Court judgment in the Shah Bano case and imposed restrictions on the media. The crown prince of Congress (Rahul Gandhi) once tore down the decision of the Union cabinet,” he said.The PM further said four different members of the same family have insulted the Constitution at different times.","PM Modi: Media is no longer a non-partisan entity. People are now aware of your beliefs as well. I have brought a new work culture and it is for the media to take a call whether they endorse it or not,"" he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110193667,imgsize-1447288,width-400,resizemode-4/110193667.jpg"
Will Swati Maliwal 'assault' case impact AAP's prospects in LS elections?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-swati-maliwal-assault-case-impact-aaps-prospects-in-ls-elections/articleshow/110214637.cms,"NEW DELHI: For the Aam Aadmi Party and the opposition bloc INDIA, the controversy around the alleged assault of party MP Swati Maliwal at the residence of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal could not have come at a worse time. Maliwal's allegation of assault against Bibhav Kumar , who is Kejriwal's ex-PA, has snowballed into a huge controversy. The BJP has gone all out against Kejriwal and the INDIA bloc.The AAP , on the other hand, has accused the saffron party of hatching a conspiracy to entrap the Delhi chief minister using Swati Maliwal.The controversy comes in the middle of a fiercely contested Lok Sabha elections , with three phases of voting still left. This includes polling in Delhi and Punjab where the AAP has huge stakes. It was only last week that the AAP got a major boost when the Supreme Court decided to grant interim bail to Kejriwal, who was in jail in an alleged money laundering case in connection with the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy.On May 10, SC allowed Kejriwal to come out and campaign for his party till June 1, the last day of voting, despite very strong objections raised by the Enforcement Directorate in the top court. Kejriwal's release provided new momentum - not just to his party but also to the opposition camp - as the Delhi chief minister embarked on his campaign drive after missing the first three phases of Lok Sabha elections.However, with the assault saga getting ugly and taking a political turn, both AAP and the BJP - have engaged in a blame game over the incident. Swati Maliwal's decision to lodge an FIR with Delhi Police, three days after the incident, was a clear hint of her isolation within the party. Delhi Police, which comes under the Centre, has often been the bone of contention between the BJP and AAP. In fact, in 2023 as the chairperson of Delhi Commission for Women, Swati Maliwal had gone out on a late-night drive on the streets of the national capital to check the promptness of Delhi police to help women in distress. After an incident involving a car that dragged her in front of AIIMS, Swati Maliwal had then targeted the police and wondered how women could feel safe in Delhi if the DCW chairperson was attacked on the streets.The BJP has questioned the silence of Kejriwal and slammed the delay on the part of AAP in taking action against chief minister's close aide Bibhav Kumar. The saffron party has also targeted the allies of AAP for not speaking against the incident. Kejriwal is yet to react on the incident. On Thursday, when Kejriwal was asked about the assault incident during a joint press conference with Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, he kept mum. When the reporters insisted, Akhilesh came to his rescue and said ""there are other important things to talk about."" Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi did back Maliwal, but did not comment on the incident calling it an internal matter of AAP.In her FIR, Maliwal levelled serious allegations against Bibhav Kumar, accusing him of slapping her and also kicking her in her abdomen, chest and pelvis area. The FIR revealed shocking details of the alleged assault. However, hours after the FIR details came into public domain, a video surfaced which showed Maliwal in an altercation with Kejriwal's security staff and also threatening one of them.The AAP, after first admitting that Bibhav Kumar had misbehaved with the party MP, went on the offensive against its party MP. AAP minister Atishi called Swati Maliwal the face of BJP conspiracy which was aimed to entrap Kejriwal. Citing the video doing the rounds, Atishi claimed that Maliwal's lies had been exposed. Atishi said Maliwal had come to the CM house without a prior appointment as her actual target was Kejriwal and not Bibhav Kumar. Meanwhile, Bibhav has now filed a countercomplaint narrating the incidents on the day.The Delhi Police has already swung into action. Swati Maliwal was taken to Kejriwal's residence to recreate the crime scene.Clearly, we haven't heard the last word in this controversy. What appeared to be an internal matter of the Aam Aadmi Party is now a full-blown war between the BJP and Kejriwal's party. There are several unanswered questions. Why did Maliwal delay lodging a police complaint? Why did AAP first blame Bibhav of misbehaving with Maliwal? All these questions are bound to become a part of the campaign discourse. The BJP will not let go of this opportunity to corner Kejriwal. However, today's turn of events shows that the AAP is ready to counter the BJP offensive. It has already declared Swati Maliwal a pawn in the hands of the BJP and claims the saffron party is ruffled by Kejriwal's campaign.",The BJP has gone all out against Kejriwal and the INDIA bloc. The AAP has accused the saffron party of hatching a conspiracy to entrap the Delhi chief minister using Swati Maliwal. The controversy comes in the middle of a fiercely contested Lok Sabha elections.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110214798,imgsize-852296,width-400,resizemode-4/110214798.jpg"

TMC to BJP to TMC to BJP: Turncoat tag threatens to spoil MP Arjun’s party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/tmc-to-bjp-to-tmc-to-bjp-turncoat-tag-threatens-to-spoil-mp-arjuns-party/articleshow/110217233.cms,"KOLKATA: The all-too-frequent flipflops in choosing which side of the political fence he wants to be on could come to haunt BJP Barrackpore candidate Arjun Singh in case of a close fight this time.This despite the fact that Singh continues to be a force to reckon with in Barrackpore — something that has kept his rival Partha Bhowmick, the Trinamool Congress ( TMC ) nominee and a state minister, on tenterhooks.With nearly 15 lakh eligible voters, Barrackpore is set for a highstakes showdown on May 20 in the fifth phase of polling.As the countdown begins, all eyes are on Singh given his political somersaults. He has the highest number of declared criminal cases among all Bengal candidates. He has also recorded the highest spike in declared assets.Denied a ticket by TMC, Singh made a dramatic switch to the saffron party just before these elections, repeating a pattern seen five years ago when he had defected from TMC to BJP and won the Barrackpore seat — only to return to the TMC fold three years later.This northern suburb of Kolkata stands out as an industrial hub, stretching along the eastern bank of the Hooghly. From Barrackpore to Shyamnagar, the skyline is dominated by towering chimneys. However, the once-vibrant industrial landscape now wears a sombre veil, with only a handful of those chimneys billowing smoke sporadically.Major industrial units, such as the Empire Jute Mill, are functional only intermittently, while others such as Loomtex Cotton, Naihati Jute, and Gouripore Jute remain shut. Ichapore Rifle and Metal & Steel continue to grapple with an ever thinning order book for arms and ammunition.Meanwhile, forgotten entities such as Bengal Enamel and Mahaluxmi Cotton in nearby Palta have had the land on their premises repurposed for the construction of modern apartment complexes.Further north, the fate of Kakinada Paper Mill and Meghni Mill mirrors the broader downturn, with both having pulled their shutters down.With the fortune of these manufacturing facilities nosediving over the years, those employed at these places have been forced to endure a hand-to-mouth existence, a stark reflection of the economic challenges plaguing the region.The Barrackpore electorate predominantly comprises workingclass citizens, with more than half the voters hailing from here. Notably, around 35% of them are Hindispeaking, underscoring a diverse demographic tapestry.In the last assembly polls in 2021, TMC won six of the seven assembly segments under the Barrackpore Lok Sabha seat.Going by those results, one may assume there won’t be too many creases for the TMC candidate to iron out, with Bhowmick himself exuding confidence in his ability to counter Singh’s influence, banking on his local support base.However, poll dynamics do not always follow a linear logic, more so in case of Barrackpore, where the intricacies are far too deeprooted to justify a pure arithmetic-based conclusion. With Singh’s influence extending beyond party lines, particularly among Hindi-speaking voters concentrated in the constituency’s jute belt, even the most hardnosed political pundit would perhaps not hazard a guess on the outcome at this stage.In 2019, BJP candidate Singh won by just 14,000 votes, with at least four assembly segments — Bijpur, Naihati, Jagaddal, and Noapara — going down to the wire. Among the remaining segments, while Amdanga favoured TMC, Bhatpara and Barrackpore voted decisively for BJP, ensuring Singh’s victory.With 2019 producing such a photo-finish, political analysts foresee a repeat show this time around as well. More so, with CPM’s recent resurgence threatening to act as a party-pooper for the saffron brigade.","With nearly 15 lakh eligible voters, Barrackpore is set for a highstakes showdown on May 20 in the fifth phase of polling.

Given that the balance of power within this Lok Sabha constituency is currently skewed against the saffron brigade, BJP knows this may not quite be the open-and-shut case that many perceive it to be, while RJD is clearly hoping for a David vs Goliath.As the campaign cavalcade with Rohini stops in front of a house, a happy-looking Jeevachh Devi rushes out with a garland, even as the RJD candidate rolls down the window glass. While Rohini strikes up a conversation with Jeevachh Devi, Nilam Devi standing nearby, whispers to another lady: “Dekhaaa, ihe ladki apna baap ko kidney deke jan bachawal rahe (See, this is the girl who saved her father by donating one of her kidneys).”Even as women standing outside try hard to catch a glimpse of the candidate, Rohini explains the importance of pressing the ‘lantern’ (RJD poll symbol) button on the EVM come May 20.“If you want to break the backbone of rising inflation, crave for a happy and healthy life and want a ‘pucca’ (concrete) home, then vote for RJD,” Rohini, covering her head with a green scarf, tells the women before moving to the next door.Rohini’s kidney story has found a fair bit of traction in rural pockets of Bihar. “She is a big hit in the villages. Everyone wants to see Lalu’s ‘laadli’ who set an example for society by donating her kidney to her father,” said Arvind Rai from Chirand village, adding: “Jahan bhi jati hai log kahten hain ki Lalu ki laadli aayee hain” (Wherever she goes, she is referred to as ‘Lalu’s darling’).“If I can donate a kidney for my father, I won’t hesitate to sacrifice my life for the people of my constituency,” Rohini says while addressing a public meeting in this seat where of 18 lakh voters, 8.5 lakh are women.The emotional connect of the kidney story notwithstanding, Rohini’s battle-hardened rival Rudy remains unfazed. “As a pilot, I know when to take off and where to land,” Rudy tells the media, obliquely referring to Rohini’s lack of experience in electoral politics.While Rudy’s campaign pitch in Saran is being powered by such stalwarts as Prime Minister Narendra Modi and defence minister Rajnath Singh, Rohini has been left with doing a lot of the heavy lifting by herself, with no top RJD neta seen anywhere near her campaign trail.Failing health has forced her father to stay away from the heat and dust of late, while her younger brother and the party’s lone star campaigner Tejashwi Yadav is battling a severe back pain. Elder sister Misa Bharti could have added some heft to Rohini’s campaign, but she herself is tied up with campaigning as the candidate from Patliputra.So far, Lalu was seen campaigning for Rohini only twice —introducing her to the voters of Saran and on the day she filed her nomination papers.Apart from the political legacy that she has inherited by virtue of being a member of a family that has produced two chief ministers, Rohini is also banking on the significant presence of Yadavs, OBCs and Muslim voters in Saran. She would also be hoping for a split in the Extremely Backward Classes (EBC) votes following Bihar CM Nitish Kumar’s volte face and return back to the NDA fold.Rudy, on the other hand, has a lot to going for him — right from the PM turning out for him to his own popularity as a two-time MP from Saran. There’s also a considerable Rajput, upper caste and EBC presence in the constituency that could work for him.“Rudy ji ka palda bhari hai (Rudy has the upper hand),” says Abhishek Kumar Singh, a resident of Aami village under Dighwara assembly constituency. “Whatever you find here — roads, power, education — are gifts from Rudy. Also, he is educated, the country is progressing under PM Modi, and the (Ram) temple has been built,” says Anand Kumar Sigh, one of the villagers.If that gives you the impression that Rudy is headed for a cakewalk, then sample this: “Some 40 lakh people in this constituency are directly or indirectly linked to sandmining, but the state authorities have cracked down on them and rocked their boat big time. BJP will have to face its consequences,” says Pran Yadav. The youth added: “Na job mila, na business (I neither have a job nor own a business).”“Unemployment is a major issue among the youth. Sadly though, the poor get influenced by just 5kg of free ration,” rued Dhananjay Prasad, a student.","Rohini Acharya is the daughter of RJD chief and former CM Lalu Prasad. She is the party’s candidate from Saran in Bihar's Lok Sabha elections. She has been left with doing a lot of the heavy lifting by herself, with no top RJD neta seen near her campaign trail.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110217195,imgsize-1469918,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110217195.jpg"

You are up against two-time MP and union minister Kaushal Kishore. Where do you stand?

What do you think is your strength, and why will people vote for India Bloc?

But the opposition says, “Abki baar 400 paar”

The India Bloc has pledged to increase reservation in govt jobs. How do you plan to advocate for this in your seat?

You have been a founding member of BSP along with Kanshi Ram, and were part of the movement that gave Dalits an identity. What is your opinion on the current Dalit assertion in politics?

INDIA Bloc candidate from Mohanlalganj,, a founding member of BSP is now with SP, because he feels that Akhilesh Yadav ’s call for PDA ('Picchde (backward classes), Dalits and Alpsankhyak (minorities)' will help fulfil BR Ambedkar ’s dream of equality. In an interview with, he also predicts that Akhilesh will become the Prime Minister one day.Excerpts.I am sure I have a fair chance as the constituency has seen no development work in the last decade. The area resonates with the slogan ‘Bijli, Paani, Sadak Adhuri, RK Chaudhary karenge poori.’ I have won from Mohanalalganj as an MLA four times and know the area well.We have a clear strategy to inform people about BJP 's failure in generating jobs and controlling inflation. Most importantly, we emphasize that the current govt did not address the issue related to loan accrued by farmers, even after they committed suicide. In contrast, industrialists received all taxation waivers from the govt. Distributing free salt and ration is not the solution.All the MPs and MLAs of the BJP are dependent on PM Narendra Modi. The BJP can manipulate the media to divert attention from issues such as electoral bonds, discrimination against Dalits, OBCs, unemployment, and price rise. Initially, they also managed to create a divide between Hindus and Muslims, but now it also has fizzled out. The people of the country know that the BJP does not believe in the constitution drafted by BR Ambedkar but believes in the laws of Manusmriti. The people understand that the constitution, democracy, and the rights given by the constitution to the OBCs and Dalits are in danger under the current regime, so they will vote wisely.In UP, as per estimates, OBCs constitute 52% and Dalits 23%. We are striving for a caste-based census if voted to power. Thereafter, all this will fall in line. Then both private and govt jobs, contracts, and distributions will be determined by the percentage share of the caste.The entire country is proud of Kanshi Ram, who gave the “Jo Bahujan ki baat karega, wo Delhi se rajya karega” mantra to us. Now that he is no more, his mission is being taken forward by Akhilesh Yadav, who has come up with a PDA plank. The SP chief has the capability to lead both the movement and the nation, and one day will become the prime minister as the entire Dalit community will support him. I have seen the struggle of Bhim Army chief Chandra Shekhar Azad, but he has not been able to turn this struggle into a movement. Mayawati too has not performed as expected.","RK Chaudhary, a founding member of BSP, is now with SP.

Election Commission's updated turnouts for 4 phases up votes by 1.07 crore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/election-commissions-updated-turnouts-for-4-phases-up-votes-by-1-07-crore/articleshow/110218098.cms,"An analysis of turnout numbers put out by EC late night of the day of polling in each phase and the latest updated numbers shows that the difference could be nearly 1.07 crore votes over the first four phases of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls . That's an average of over 28,000 votes per constituency for the 379 that have finished polling.How do we reach this conclusion? The EC has been putting out data on turnout in various stages in each phase, apart from what is available 'real-time' on its app.The latest data put out on polling day in each phase has been for somewhere between 10.30 pm and 11.30 pm. The 'final' figures - which still do not include postal votes and which the EC app cautions are ""approximate trends"" - were put out 11 days after polling day for the first phase, and four days after polling for phase 2, 3 and 4.The final figures have been only very slightly different from figures put out typically late evening on the day after polling. However, they vary considerably from the data put out on polling night in several states. Since the EC has also put out numbers for the electorate in each constituency - though only after the first two phases and a controversy over the lack of any absolute numbers - and since the turnout data is correct to two decimal places, it is possible to get an approximation of the votes cast by working back (see graphic).Such calculation backward shows that the implied difference in number of votes for the two turnout figures was about 18.6 lakh for phase 1, 32.2 lakh for phase 2, 22.1 lakh for phase 3 and 33.9 lakh for phase 4, totalling up to 1.07 crore.The biggest variations were in Andhra Pradesh, 4.2 percentage points in turnout and 17.2 lakh in derived vote numbers, Maharashtra (2.4 percentage points and 16.7 lakh), Kerala (4.1 percentage points and 11.4 lakh) and Assam (4.2 percentage points and 10.3 lakh). In Assam's case, that translates to an average difference of over 73,000 per constituency. For Andhra Pradesh, the average is 69,000 and for Kerala 57,000. Karnataka at 51,000 and Maharashtra at 48,000 have also seen significant differences.

"No delay in publishing polling data, says EC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-delay-in-publishing-polling-data-says-ec/articleshow/110217864.cms,"Is EC taking more time to publish final

polling data

in every phase than 2019?

It won't be a big deal if EC puts the exact data for public consumption: Experts

Why does final data get published four days after polling?

Why is EC not disclosing the exact number of votes polled?

Is there a pattern behind raising questions?

There has been controversy surrounding the publication of final voter turnout data in each phase of the ongoing Lok Sabha election, with the issue now in the Supreme Court. After Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge raised questions on these issues, the Election Commission sent a strong rebuttal.Opposition has questioned EC taking days to publish the final turnout and also not disclosing the exact number of votes polled after every phase as was done in the last LS polls.EC officials have outrightly denied any delay in publishing the polling data.They have cited details to point out that this time, final voter turnout data was published four days after polling, against a gap of at least six days after voting in every phase in 2019. Also, even in 2019, the updated and final polling percentage were higher than the data put out on the day of polling at the press conference after each phase.On the publication of final data of first phase polling after 11 days, officials said the figure of 66.1% polling was similar to 66% turnout as reported in the EC's voter turnout app on Apr 21 night. In fact, there has not been much difference in the numbers put out on the day after polling by when details have come in even from remote booths, and the ""final figures"" released by EC for all the four phases.This time, the poll panel has not held press conferences, and has been issuing statements giving details of the voter turnout only in percentage terms.The poll panel has maintained that poll data can't be manipulated, which former ECs have strongly supported. ""There is no scope in the system to manipulate voter turnout data. In the past too final polling data has changed from the figures published on the day of polling as the numbers are updated,"" former Election Commissioner Ashok Lavasa said.He, however, added that EC should not hesitate put out the exact data in public domain with caveats. ""What's wrong in sharing it and how does this do any harm? If there is more transparency, there is more trust. Since candidates (who have exact number of votes polled) are not obliged to publish the data on voter turnout, EC should do that for public consumption,"" he told TOI.Last month, SC examined in detail the entire process of recording the number of votes cast and counting them and found it to be trustworthy.The EC's Voter Turnout App, which can be downloaded on the phone, displays the estimated voting on poll day at regular intervals till midnight. After the poll parties deployed at different booths across a constituency return on Election Day, the turnout data is updated after scrutiny of documents by returning officers. This is done in the presence of all candidates and observers, leaving no room for complaint. Almost 90% of the updates are done by midnight.However, in some cases, the data is updated the next day since poll parties take time to return from remote locations. So, on the second day, almost the entire data is released. Data may be get updated further, especially in constituencies where repoll is conducted. The day after the repoll data is in, EC releases the final turnout figures.Officials said there is full transparency in preparing the turnout data and the norms have remained the same for decades. Voter turnout is recorded at polling station level in Form 17C, which is prepared by the presiding officer and signed by polling agents of candidates. Copies of the forms are shared with polling agents and at the end of polling, all candidates or their agents get the 17C data and with this ""fundamental task of disclosure"" is completed. All booth agents give their reports to candidates by late evening. So, each candidate is aware of the votes polled and are matched at the time of counting. EC sources also point out that with voting over in 381 constituencies, not a single candidate has complained about any irregularity in recording the number of votes cast.In a press release issued by PIB on April 13, 2019, two days after the first phase of polling, EC said the voter turnout was 69.4% and had also put the exact number of votes cast. But in the subsequent phases, only the overall percentage was provided on polling day.EC officials said the poll body has published the exact number of electors for each constituency, excluding the service electors, and provides the polling percentage. So, people can calculate them to arrive at the exact number of votes polled instead of waiting for the poll body to publish the data. However, experts feel that it won't be a big deal, if EC puts the exact data for public consumption.""Since EC puts the percentage of votes polled, it knows the exact number of people voted. So, it should publish the numbers,"" said two former EC officials.Sources said some political parties have been raising questions on different aspects of the election process, from discrepancies in voter list to EVM. But these issues have been put to rest by the Supreme Court. The latest issue raised relates to polling data. ""Raising questions on such issues is baseless. Had it been possible to manipulate data and the process, would we have so many regional parties doing so well?"" said an official.",There has been controversy surrounding the publication of final voter turnout data in each phase of the ongoing Lok Sabha election.

"Explain increase in voting percentage days after polling, SC tells EC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/explain-increase-in-voting-percentage-days-after-polling-sc-tells-ec/articleshow/110217831.cms,"Absence of figures in absolute numbers raises concerns: ADR

'Heatwave An Excuse. If Contests Are Close, Voters Will Come': Pollster Yashwant Deshmukh

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday sought Election Commission 's response to the application by an NGO , Association for Democratic Reforms, expressing apprehension about possible replacement of electronic voting machines citing the big increase in final voting percentage figures days after polling.A bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra ordered the EC to file its response to ADR's application by May 24, when it will be heard by a vacation bench during the court's summer break, which commences from Monday.ADR has sought a direction to the EC to publish voting data within 48 hours of close of polling.When the bench asked ""what is the difficulty in putting the turnout data on the website"", the EC counsel said it ""took time as we have to collect a lot of data"".On April 26, the SC had dismissed ADR's plea for return to ballot papers and its suspicion of EVMs.With the court taking up the same NGO’s plea again doubting the fairness of the electoral process, EC’s counsel, senior advocate Maninder Singh, emphasised that senior officials of the poll panel had answered every doubt expressed by the NGO’s counsel Prashant Bhushan and a bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta, after several interactions with EC officials, had on April 26 dismissed the ‘back to ballot’ plea and rejected the doubts against EVMs by saying they were trustworthy.“Just because Bhushan feels like bringing anything through an application, that too in a petition pending since 2019, the court should not entertain it. These are attempts to impede the election process, four phases of which have been completed smoothly,” Singh said.The CJI-led bench took exception to the charge of preferential treatment being given to Bhushan and said, “That is a wrong charge. If we find an issue requires the court’s attention and intervention, we will do so irrespective of who brings it before the court. If required, we will sit the whole night to hear a matter.” In fact, the bench heard the plea at 6.10pm, hours after the scheduled end of business hours.On April 26, Justices Khanna and Datta had said, “In our considered opinion, EVMs are simple, secure and user-friendly. Voters, candidates and their representatives, and officials of the EC, are aware of the nitty-gritty of the EVM system. Incorporation of the VVPAT system fortifies the principle of vote verifiability, thereby enhancing the overall accountability of the electoral process.”Justices Khanna and Datta had also detailed the process of calculating and publishing voting percentage under Form 17C — the most crucial part for ascertaining the number of votes cast, and said the voting percentage was provided to each polling agent.ADR had moved the court with an application soon after Congress, TMC and CPM wrote to EC alleging unusual delay in release of final voter turnout figures for phase one and two of the ongoing elections. ADR alleged that voter turnout data for April 19 was published on April 30 and that for the second phase on April 26 was published on April 30, after a delay of 11 and four days, respectively.ADR said, “The data as published by EC in its press release dated April 30 shows a sharp increase (by about 5-6%) as compared to the initial percentages announced by EC as of 7pm on the day of polling. Inordinate delay in release of final voter turnout data, coupled with the unusually high revision (of over 5%) in the EC’s press note of April 30, and the absence of disaggregated constituency and polling station figures in absolute numbers, has raised concerns and public suspicion regarding the correctness of the said data.“These apprehensions must be addressed and put to rest. In order to uphold voters’ confidence, it is necessary that the EC be directed to disclose on its website scanned legible copies of Form 17C Part- I (account of votes recorded) of all polling stations which contain the authenticated figures for votes polled within 48 hours of the close of polling.”","ADR has sought a direction to the EC to publish voting data within 48 hours of close of polling.

NEW DELHI: In a startling revelation, the FIR lodged by the Delhi Police based on the complaint by AAP Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal against Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal 's former personal secretary has brought to light disturbing details.The complaint was filed against the former aide, and the FIR was registered at the Civil Lines police station.According to the MP's allegations, the incident occurred on May 13 at the Chief Minister's residence, where Kumar allegedly ""slapped her multiple times and hit her on the chest and stomach.""

I then sent a message on his mobile number (through WhatsApp). However, there was no response. I then went inside the residential area through the main door as I have always done in the past year since Bibhav Kumar was not present I entered the residence area and informed the staff present there to tell the CM here to meet him,"" the FIR read.""I was informed that he was present in the house and I was told to wait in the drawing room.

""One of the staff members came and told me that CM was coming to meet me and suddenly, the PS of CM, Bibhav Kumar barged into the room. He started screaming without any provocation and even started abusing me. I was stunned by this....and I reacted by telling him to stop talking to me like this and to call the CM.""""He then abused me and asked who are you to not listen to what I say. While saying these words, he came and stood right in front of me. Without any provocation whatsoever on my side, he started slapping me with full force. He slapped me seven to eight times at least while I continued screaming. I felt absolutely shocked and was screaming for help over and over again. In order to protect myself I pushed him away with my legs,"" she said.""At that time, he pounced on me, brutally dragged me and deliberately pulled my shirt up. My shirt buttons opened and my shirt flew up. I landed on the floor while hitting my head on the centre table. I was constantly screaming for help but no one came.

You are contesting after 20 years. Why Sambalpur?

Your thoughts on BJD's challenge to BJP in Odisha.

Ex-bureaucrat V K Pandian said if BJP gets 40-50 seats in Odisha Vidhan Sabha, it will break BJD.

Naveen Patnaik

has been saying BJP leaders are shedding crocodile tears on Odisha's problems.

Modi

has said an Odia person will be CM of Odisha. Are you a contender?

Your views on Arvind Kejriwal's claim that Modi will retire at 75.

That's because of the political circumstances here.Odisha was first state to be created based on language in 1936. Before that, it faced a devastating drought. Odia leadership then realised that until we have a unique identity, there will be no development. Though the state was created based on language, the reason was development and sufferings from that drought. After 88 years, we come across a dreadful reality, be it health of Odia youth, status of education of new generation or employment.Despite being a regional party, the CM could not find one Odia from the state's 4.5 crore population whom he could trust with future (of BJD ). He trusted a gang of bureaucrats who want to capture the political leadership through back door. There is anger against this in society. It is our responsibility to safeguard future of Odisha - culture, tradition, language, food and development - which is connected to Odia asmita.400 paar has become a social movement that has come out of the collective wisdom of the country. The country still needs strong decisions over the next few decades, which only a strong govt can deliver. A strong mandate is forthcoming for NDA and that's why we said close to 400 seats will be achieved. INDI alliance is scattered. This will fizzle out soon. People's trust in the PM is high in Odisha. We are confident of forming govt with majority in Vidhan Sabha. We are winning all 21 LS seats.BJP was in govt under Atalji for six years, followed by past 10 years under Modiji. Give one instance in these 16 years where BJP meddled with the Constitution. On the contrary, those who are making such allegations have changed the Constitution multiple times.I hail from this rich cultural region of Odisha and this has been part of my previous constituency. It's my fortune that the party has approved my request to contest from this 'maryada janak sthan'.BJD is in office here and, naturally, we have been in opposition for years now. This time, people are angry with the party, there is a strong anti-incumbency and there is a strong trust factor in Modiji. This time, Odia people will leave BJD behind.There is no need to break anything, people are going to show BJD the door this time.These are allegations to hide their incompetence. Naveen babu and his gang are not ready to face the truth, they are not in a position to answer people what they have done in past 25 years.What the PM said is true. The issue is in whose hand does future of Odisha lie? With outsourced people or Odias? BJP will hand the mantle to an Odia.He is a liar, it's his habit. He should take care of his house. Amit Shahji clarified that our leader is PM Narendra Modi and there is no alternative to that.","BJP will form govt in Odisha with a majority in assembly polls & also win all 21 Lok Sabha seats, Union minister Harmendra Pradhan tells TOI.
