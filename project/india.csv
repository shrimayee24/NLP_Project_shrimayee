""Congress Only Party To Respect Him..."" Pappu Yadav Alleges BJP Sidelining Nitish Kumar in NDA

NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), saying he had joined the party “because of circumstances.” Reaffirming his commitment to the NDA , he said he is “back in NDA for good.” He also criticised the RJD’s rule before his 20-year tenure as chief minister, saying, “pehle bahut bura haal tha,” and highlighted the shortcomings of the Lalu-Rabri governments, taking aim at their administration.Addressing his first election rally in Minapur, Muzaffarpur, Kumar took a dig at his rival Lalu Prasad and said, “Because of circumstances, I had to tie up with those people, but it did not take me long to realise that they were good for nothing. Now I am back (in NDA) for good.”Kumar recalled that his earlier alliances with the RJD in 2015 and 2022 both lasted less than two years. On both occasions, Lalu’s son Tejashwi Yadav, now leader of the opposition in Vidhan Sabha, served as his deputy chief minister.He highlighted his government’s focus on improving infrastructure, education, and healthcare in Bihar, and praised the Narendra Modi government at the Centre for its support.Talking about law and order, Kumar said, “An atmosphere of terror had prevailed in Bihar because of poor law and order and alleged patronage to criminals by the powers that be, until I took over. But now, it is for all to see how much things have changed.”He added that communal harmony has also improved. “Even disputes between Hindus and Muslims have come down because we were sensitive to needs like fencing of religious places of both faiths,” he said.Taking a swipe at Lalu Prasad, Kumar accused him of ignoring women’s welfare during his tenure. “Did the ones in power do anything for women? They could not have cared less. Only when, after seven years of chief ministership, a situation came where stepping down could not have been avoided, the wife was installed,” he said, referring to Rabri Devi’s appointment as chief minister in 1997.Kumar contrasted this with his own government’s focus on women’s empowerment, citing the success of self-help groups and the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, under which Rs 10,000 each has been transferred to over one crore women beneficiaries.Seeking a record fifth consecutive term, Nitish Kumar said he was disillusioned with the RJD after two short-lived alliances and has now decided to stay with the NDA for good.","Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) Reaffirming his commitment to the NDA, he said he is “back in NDA for good” He also criticised the RJD’s rule before his 20-year tenure as chief minister.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124732757,imgsize-896340,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-70.jpg"
"Bihar Assembly polls: Opposition allies climb down, yet face friendly fights in state",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-assembly-polls-opposition-allies-climb-down-yet-face-friendly-fights-in-state/articleshow/124710181.cms,"Bihar Polls: RJD Announces Candidate List for Bihar Elections, 143 Contenders

Poll Do you think the political situation in Bihar will improve before the elections? Yes, there's potential for improvement No, it will likely worsen

Dissent rules, both in INDIA bloc and NDA



PATNA: Just a fortnight before the first phase of polling in Bihar, partners in the INDIA bloc, which seemed to be in a disarray till Sunday, appeared going into the damage-control mode on Monday with some withdrawing candidates against each other on certain seats. RJD announced its list of 143 candidates, leaving the remaining 100 for its allies. It dropped 31 MLAs and nominated new candidates. Congress has fielded candidates for 61 seats, while the Left comprising the CPI-ML, CPI and CPM announced its list of 30. On the other hand, the VIP led by former minister Mukesh Sahani has come up with its list of 15 candidates, which means the INDIA bloc partners still have some friendly contests on at least six seats.Opposition bloc leaders said they were hoping the clouds of uncertainty would clear by Oct 23, the last date of withdrawal of candidature for the second phase.Significantly, JMM withdrew from the Bihar contest after a stalemate over their seat-sharing deal with INDIA bloc. “Unfortunately, JMM won’t be part of the Bihar polls despite my intentions and plans. This is only because of RJD’s ‘political’ immaturity. Congress should have mediated to accommodate JMM, but we are sorry to say that it too did nothing,” said senior JMM legislator and state urban development minister Sudivya Kumar.There was consensus in INDIA bloc over the CM face till Monday night. Despite RJD being the largest bloc with 143 seats to its share, Congress has so far refrained from announcing Tejashwi Yadav as the CM face although he is the coordination committee chairman. Also, INDIA bloc members have not come together in a show of unity for a long time and have been speaking through the media only, adding to confusion in the opposition bloc.In seat-sharing, things looked moving in some direction when RJD didn’t announce its candidate from Kutumba seat against Congress candidate and party’s state chief Rajesh Kumar. RJD had earlier announced it would field its candidate from this seat after the conflict intensified between the two partners, in alliance for the past 35 years.On the other hand, Congress candidate Aditya Kumar withdrew his nomination from Lalganj seat on Monday, in a relief to RJD nominee. RJD had fielded Shivani Shukla, daughter of jailed strongman Munna Shukla, from this seat.In another development, VIP candidate Sakaldeo Bind withdrew his candidature from Tarapur seat in favour of RJD candidate. A visibly annoyed Bind soon resigned from the party and lent his support to BJP candidate and deputy CM Samrat Choudhary, a VIP spokesperson said.“Things are moving in the right direction and the situation will be more clear by Oct 23, the last date for withdrawal of candidature,” Congress legislature party leader Shakeel Ahmad Khan said on Monday. However, another bloc partner CPI haven’t withdrawn candidates against Congress in three seats.Initially, JMM announced to go solo after seat talks failed but suddenly on Monday urban development minister Sudivya Kumar said, “JMM won’t be part of the Bihar polls.” Kumar said, “Hemant Sorenji and JMM has always been following coalition dharma. Even when RJD had one MLA in 2019, we gave them seat in cabinet. Again now, we accommodated them. But what we got is deceit,” he said.Purnia MP Pappu Yadav, who earlier merged his party with Congress, asked the latter to break alliance with RJD on Monday, blaming the latter for not following “coalition dharma”.Things don’t look good in the rival NDA as well as former Union minister and BJP leader Raj Kumar Singh launched sharp attacks on his party for giving tickets to persons with criminal antecedents. He appealed to the people not to vote for opposition candidates such as Osama Shahab, son of RJD politician late Mohammad Anant Singh and RJD candidate from Mokama Veena Devi.","RJD announced its list of 143 candidates, leaving the remaining 100 for its allies.

Bihar Assembly polls: Congress rushes Ashok Gehlot to Bihar to break seat deadlock with RJD,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-rushes-gehlot-to-bihar-to-break-seat-deadlock-with-rjd/articleshow/124729074.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress is rushing senior politician Ashok Gehlot to Patna for a meeting with RJD scion Tejashwi Yadav to resolve Bihar assembly election-related issues, ranging from “friendly fights” to manifesto release and campaign plan. Opposition sources said Congress general secretary KC Venugopal held a discussion with Tejashwi, following which Gehlot, state in-charge Krishna Allavaru and RJD will hold talks on Wednesday.The state netas of ‘Mahagathbandhan’ alliance partners are likely to hold a press conference on Thursday to show a picture of unity ahead of launching the poll campaign. The urgency comes amid the disappointment over delayed finalisation of seat sharing in a difficult challenge of Bihar elections against the BJP-JDU combination.The Congress brass is learnt to be frustrated with RJD over the protracted seat-sharing process, with sources claiming that even Congress could not finalise its tickets till late because it did not know the seats that were coming its way. ‘“The process started two months ago,” a senior politician said. Also, Congress insiders are miffed at the way allies have been “treated“ by RJD. There is a regret that JMM has not been accommodated, “which should have been”, with sources pointing out that even VIP of Mukesh Sahani got its share after the intervention by the Congress brass.“The elder partner should have been accommodative of all allies to ensure a better chemistry and optics,” an opposition neta said.The “unaccommodative attitude” is being blamed for allies having fielded candidates against each other in around 10 seats, with Congress and RJD facing off against each other in four seats. However, sources said keen attempts are underway to completely remove or minimise the “friendly fights”.What is seen to have hurt the optics is the absence of a joint release of seat sharing and candidates, which has “undercut” the atmosphere created by a united statewide “Voter Adhikar Yatra” of allies headed by Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi.Now, the alliance is trying to reinvigorate the partnership by first holding a joint show of state leaders, followed by a joint campaign which will involve Rahul and other senior netas. The issue of announcing a CM candidate is another challenge. Congress netas said only one party, RJD, has a CM candidate, which is good enough as projection.They argue that leaving it unsaid would have fulfilled some “political objectives” but RJD’s insistence has created complications — hinting that the alliance may oblige RJD. “There should be a joint press conference soon by state netas, let’s see what happens there,” a senior neta said.Most minor allies have indicated that they have no reservations about an upfront projection of a chief ministerial candidate in the state.",Ashok Gehlot to meet RJD scion Tejashwi Yadav to resolve Bihar election-related issues.

Why Magadh-Bhojpur matters



NDA's plan to breach Mahagathbandhan's fort



RJD's plan to hold the fort



1.6 lakh new voters



NEW DELHI: Dragging behind anti-incumbency and infighting within the alliance, the BJP and JD(U)-led National Democratic Alliance faces a steep climb in the politically volatile and caste-sensitive Magadh and Bhojpur regions — a contest that could decide whether Nitish Kumar retains power or cedes ground to Mahagathbandhan.In the tightly contested 2020 Bihar assembly elections , the Magadh–Bhojpur region proved to be a silver lining for the Rashtriya Janata Dal-led alliance, where it fiercely battled the JD(U) and BJP-led NDA and came out as a winner.While the Mithilanchal and Tirhut regions delivered narrow victories for the NDA, Magadh and Bhojpur — which together send 69 MLAs to the 243-member Bihar assembly — ensured a strong opposition presence in the Vidhan Sabha.The Magadh region, comprising Arwal, Jahanabad, Aurangabad, Gaya, and Nawada districts, holds 26 seats. In 2015, when chief minister Nitish Kumar was aligned with the RJD and Congress, the NDA managed to win only six seats in the broader Shahabad belt.However, the BJP staged a strong comeback in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, sweeping the Magadh–Shahabad range by winning Pataliputra, Aurangabad, Nawada, Gaya, Jehanabad, Ara, Sasaram, Buxar, and Karakat.The momentum didn’t last long — in the 2020 assembly polls, the tables turned in favour of the Grand Alliance, which captured most of the seats within those parliamentary constituencies.In 2020 assembly elections, the NDA secured just six of Magadh’s 26 seats — five in Gaya and one in Nawada — while the Mahagathbandhan bagged the remaining 20. In Bhojpur, which spans Patna, Nalanda, Bhojpur, Buxar, Rohtas, and Kaimur, the NDA won 13 of 43 seats, as against 30 for the Mahagathbandhan.In the run-up to the election, the BJP is focusing on Magadh seats to ensure a better result this time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently visited Gaya and laid the foundation for development projects worth Rs 12,000 crore, signaling the NDA's focus on this region.Meanwhile, Bhojpuri star Pawan Singh, who had previously rebelled and flirted with contesting independently, has patched up with the BJP. His differences with the party had threatened to split the Rajput vote, especially in the Shahabad and Bhojpur regions, where the caste balance is delicate.BJP leaders believe Singh’s presence will help consolidate upper-caste support and attract younger, entertainment-driven voters who identify with his larger-than-life persona.Additionally, the BJP has fielded several prominent leaders from this region in the upcoming elections. The party has nominated eight-time MLA Dr Prem Kumar from Gaya Sadar and four-time MLA Aruna Devi from Warisaliganj.Meanwhile, the RJD and Congress have mobilised their cadres in this region ahead of the elections. Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi Yadav's Voter Adhikar Yatra covered a large part of this region, while Tejashwi's Bihar Adhikar Yatra covered areas missed in the previous tour.Additionally, several NDA heavyweights from this region have jumped ship and joined the RJD ahead of the elections, altering political equations.Former JD(U) MP Jagdish Sharma’s son Rahul Sharma, JD(U) MP from Banka Girdhari Yadav’s son Chanakya Prakash, and former LJP candidate Ajay Kushwaha have joined the RJD.Interestingly, the Magadh region also witnessed the highest voter increase after the special intensive revision exercise by the Election Commission. Magadh recorded an average voter increase of 2.6 per cent, translating to 1.6 lakh new voters.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, compared to 7.89 crore in the list released before the SIR on June 24 this year.According to an Election Commission release, around 65 lakh names were removed during the revision process, bringing the number of electors in the updated draft list, as of August 1, 2025, to 7.24 crore.Bihar will go to the polls in two phases — on November 6 and November 11 — with the counting of votes scheduled for November 14.","Magadh region, comprising Arwal, Jahanabad, Aurangabad, Gaya, and Nawada districts, holds 26 seats.

NEW DELHI: An elderly Dalit man was allegedly forced to lick the ground near a temple on the outskirts of Lucknow on Diwali after being accused of urinating there, police said.As per news agency PTI, The accused has been arrested, while the victim’s family insists the incident was an accident.Rampal Rawat, 60, a resident of Kakori, told police that he was drinking water near Sheetla Maataa Mandir around 7pm on Monday when Swami Kant accused him of urinating.“I said I have not urinated, water fell while I was coughing, but he hurled casteist abuses and forced me to lick it,” Rawat said in his complaint.His grandson, Mukesh Kumar, explained that Rawat suffers from breathing difficulties, and had accidentally urinated while coughing.“My grandfather got frightened, and when asked to lick the ground, he did so. Afterwards, the accused made him wash the spot,” Mukesh said.According to police, the main temple is around 40 metres from the site of the incident.A case was registered against Swami Kant under sections 115(2) (voluntarily causing hurt), 351(3) (criminal intimidation), 352 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.A police source clarified, “The victim says he was forced to lick the ground, while the accused claims he was only asked to touch it. The matter is under investigation.”The incident triggered a political storm. Opposition parties criticised the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh, calling it a “blot on humanity.” Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav wrote on X, “Someone’s mistake does not justify humiliating, inhumane punishment. Only change can bring change!”The Congress also condemned the incident, stating on X that “an enraged RSS worker forced an elderly Dalit man to lick urine after he accidentally urinated in a temple courtyard due to illness. This reflects the anti-Dalit mentality prevalent in the BJP-RSS ecosystem.”Police, however, noted that the accused has no verified links to the RSS.(With agency inputs)","Rampal Rawat, 60, a resident of Kakori, told police that he was drinking water near Sheetla Maataa Mandir around 7pm on Monday when Swami Kant accused him of urinating.
