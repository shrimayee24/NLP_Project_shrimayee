'JMM letting infiltrators for political gains'

""

'JMM-Cong disrespected Champai Soren'



PM Modi slams Congress over 'derogatory remarks' against women

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a blistering attack against the INDIA bloc partners on Monday as he addressed two rallies in poll-bound Jharkhand . The BJP 's election campaign is in full swing, with the Prime Minister's visit coming a day after Union home minister Amit Shah addressed three rallies in the state.At the two rallies, PM Modi accused the JMM led coalition government in Jharkhand of letting infiltrators from Bangladesh and putting the state's tribal population in danger. PM Modi termed the JMM-Congress coalition of beinginfiltrators' alliance and a ""mafia's slave"".The remarks from the PM come as BJP is relentlessly attacking the Hemant Soren-led government, accusing it of allowing Bangladeshi infiltrators to settle in the state and change the demographics. ""Bangladeshi infiltration is causing a sharp decline in tribal population in Jharkhand. The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance is encouraging it for petty political gains,"" Union home minister Amit Shah said at a rally in Ghatshila on Sunday.PM said that only the BJP can guarantee Jharkhand ""suvidha"" , ""suraksha"", ""sthirta"" , and ""samriddhi"" , calling it as ""Modi's guarantee"".""Appeasement politics has reached its pinnacle in Jharkhand, where the JMM-led coalition is busy supporting Bangladeshi infiltrators. If this continues, the tribal population in Jharkhand will shrink. This is a threat to tribal society and the country,"" PM Modi said.PM Modi said that Congress and its allies intend to keep the tribal community ""poor and in deprivation"" for a long time while BJP is committed to remove poverty from Jharkhand. Further, he alleged the ruling JMM of disrespecting former chief minster Champai Soren and former JMM member, who jumped ship to the BJP recently.""What did these people (JMM) do to Champai Soren ji... these people left no stone unturned in insulting a tribal son. Those for whom nothing is bigger than their family, how will they care for you people? Such selfish parties have to be taught a good lesson. Further, he exuded confidence that people of the state are seeing it and are keen to bring BJP back to power in the state.Champai Soren, who is often referred to as the ""Kolhan tiger"" joined the BJP after an internal tiff broke out in JMM over ""insult and humiliation"" by the party. He also claimed he was put under surveillance by Jharkhand govt in Delhi, Kolkata, which strengthened his resolve to join the BJP.""BJP can save tribals'' identity, check infiltration in Jharkhand''s Santhal Pargana,"" he had said.Previously, he was the chief minister of Jharkhand , shortly after Hemant Soren resigned as the CM before being arrested by the ED in a money laundering case. In less than two months, Soren had to step down to allow the return of Hemant Soren to the chair following the latter's bail in the case.Champai Soren is now set to fight from Seraikela, which he has won six times since 1991. Champai is also working hard as he won Seraikela by a margin of a little over 15,000 votes in 2019.PM Modi also singled out the Congress-led INDIA bloc for its silence over Shiv Sena leader Arvind Sawant's ""imported maal"" against Shaina NC, a BJP leader who switched sides to the Shinde Sena faction to contest the November 20 Maharashtra election.The opposition used ""foul language"" against a woman leader"", PM Modi said.""Mothers and daughters are in shock and the people of the state will teach them a lesson,"" the Prime Minister said, also pointing out to another incident of the Congress for ""humiliating"" Sita Soren , BJP's candidate and sister-in-law of chief minister Hemant Soren.The PM also drew parallels between the Britishers pre-independence barbarism and the Congress, whom he said practiced the same with the ""blood of tribals"" in Jharkhand. ""In the 1980s when Congress was in power both in Bihar and Delhi and Jharkhand was part of Bihar back then - Gua Goli Kaand happened - the kind of barbarism the Britishers have committed here, Congress did the same with the blood of tribals"".PM Modi also accused the grand old party of of failing to deliver on its promises and said that he was shocked to see that even Congress Mallikarjun Kharge has also accepted that Congress' false promises will destroy states.""Government employees had to hold protests to get their DAs and salaries in Himachal Pradesh. The people of Telangana are suffering because of the false promises of Congress... I am shocked to see that even Congress Mallikarjun Kharge has also accepted that Congress' false promises will destroy states. This is why, you should not trust the fake promises of Congress,"" PM Modi added.Meanwhile, CM Hemant Soren, who held a rally of his own countered the BJP's allegation that the JMM government is providing ""shelter to Bangladeshi infiltrators"" and asked how the Centre could allow deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina to land and seek refuge in India.""Please tell us on what basis you allowed the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh to land in India and seek asylum. Infiltrators from Bangladesh enter India through BJP-ruled states. They are saying it themselves,"" Soren said addressing an election rally in the Garhwa Assembly seat on Sunday.The PM's visit marks the first since announcement of the assembly elections, which are scheduled to take place in two phases on November 13 and 20. The vote counting scheduled for November 23.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses two rallies in poll-bound Jharkhand.

'BJP was never so weak': Akhilesh Yadav on rescheduling of assembly bypolls in UP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-was-never-so-weak-akhilesh-yadav-on-rescheduling-of-assembly-bypolls-in-up/articleshow/114948357.cms,"Akhilesh Yadav

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India (ECI) has moved the bypolls for nine assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh from November 13th to November 20th. This decision, citing festival considerations, has sparked controversy, with Samajwadi Party (SP) supremo Akhilesh Yadav accusing the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) of manipulating the schedule to sway the outcome.Yadav, in a post on social media platform X, said, ""First the Milkipur bye-election was postponed, now the date of bye-elections for the rest of the seats has been rescheduled. The BJP was never so weak."" He further alleged that the BJP fears a defeat and is employing delaying tactics.The SP leader argued that the original election date coincided with the return of migrant workers to Uttar Pradesh for Diwali and Chhath Puja holidays. These workers, Yadav suggested, are disillusioned with the BJP and would have voted against them.By postponing the elections, he claimed, the BJP aims to disenfranchise these voters who will likely return to their places of work before the new polling date.The ECI, however, maintains that the decision was taken following requests from multiple political parties, including the Congress, BJP, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD). These parties argued that holding elections during the festive season would negatively impact voter turnout.Responding to Yadav’s accusations, BJP spokesperson Manish Shukla dismissed them as politically motivated. He said, ""The bypoll date shift was demanded as the date coincided with Hindu festival. But Samajwadi Party has to do politics in everything. More so in this case as they are least bothered about majoritarian sentiment but about their vote bank.""The nine assembly constituencies facing bypolls are Katehari, Karhal, Meerapur, Ghaziabad, Majhawan, Sishamau, Khair, Phulpur, and Kundarki.Eight of these seats were vacated by MLAs elected to the Lok Sabha , while the Sisamau seat requires a by-election due to the disqualification of its former SP MLA .","The Election Commission of India (ECI) has moved the bypolls for nine assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh from November 13th to November 20th.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Monday postponed the upcoming bypolls in Uttar Pradesh , Kerala and Punjab from November 13 to November 20. The announcement by the poll body came after national and state parties raised concerns over lower voter turnout due to various festivities coinciding with the election dates.The Congress had said that a significant portion of the electorate in Kerala's Palakkad will be engaged in the "" Kalpathi Rastholsavam "" festival to be celebrated from 13th to 15th November 2024.According to statements from the BJP, BSP, and RLD in Uttar Pradesh, residents often begin their travels three to four days in advance to celebrate Kartik Purnima .In Punjab, the Congress party has requested that the 555th Prakash Parv of Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji be celebrated on November 15, with an Akhand Path planned to commence on November 13.The Election Commission has previously adjusted polling dates in elections for voter convenience and encourage higher turnout.For instance, during the 2022 Punjab State Elections, polling was rescheduled to accommodate the celebration of Shri Guru Ravidas Ji Jayanti . Similarly, the poll dates for both phases of the 2022 Manipur assembly elections were altered due to the first phase coinciding with a Sunday.In the 2012 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, voting dates were changed due to Barawafat. The 2013 Mizoram assembly elections also saw polling and counting dates adjusted for social events and Sunday observance. Additionally, in the 2023 Rajasthan Elections, the poll date was modified forDevuthan Ekadashi , and recently in Haryana, the date was changed due to Asoj Amavasya.As a result, one assembly constituency in Kerala, four in Punjab, and nine in Uttar Pradesh will now hold polls on November 20. The dates for counting and completion of the polls for these constituencies remain unchanged as November 23 and 25, respectively.","The Election Commission on Monday postponed the upcoming bypolls in Uttar Pradesh, Kerala and Punjab from November 13 to November 20.

In Mahayuti too, BJP was left embarrassed as its official candidate in Srigonda assembly constituency in Nashik district, Pratibha Pachpute, withdrew demanding the party support her son Vikram, who has filed nomination as an independent candidate.With nominations now final, as many as 4,140 candidates are in the ring for the 288 seats in the Maharashtra assembly polls scheduled to be held on Nov 20.

MYSURU: Lokayukta police have summoned Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah for questioning Wednesday in the Mysore Urban Development Authority (Muda) case allegedly linked to him and his family. Currently in Haveri district, Siddaramaiah said in response to the notice, “I will go...,” indicating he would cooperate with the investigation.Siddaramaiah is the second chief minister of Karnataka, after BJP’s B S Yediyurappa, to be summoned by Lokayukta police for questioning in cases it is investigating. The BJP politician was questioned in 2011 for his alleged role in mining and land denotification cases. The special court for criminal cases involving current and former legislators has assigned Lokayukta police with investigation of the case. The inquiry centres around allegations of irregularities in the allotment of 14 sites to Parvathi by Muda.T J Udesha, superintendent of police, Mysuru Lokayukta, told TOI the chief minister has received a notice to provide evidence concerning the allegations and is expected to appear before him at the Lokayukta office in Mysuru.The investigation involves Siddaramaiah, Parvathi, his brother-in-law B M Mallikarjuna Swamy, landowner Devaraju, and others named in the FIR filed by Lokayukta police on Sept 27. Parvathi, Swamy, and Devaraju have already given statements to the Lokayukta police.On Oct 24, Siddaramaiah had filed an appeal before a Karnataka high court division bench contesting a previous ruling by a single judge bench regarding Muda site allotment.So far, Lokayukta authorities have interrogated several individuals in connection with the alleged scam, including former deputy commissioner and Congress MP G Kumar Naik, former IAS officer S Palaiah (now a revenue member of Karnataka’s Land-Grabbing Prohibition Special Court), former minister B N Bachegowda, and a former tehsildar.","Siddaramaiah is the second chief minister of Karnataka, after BJP’s B S Yediyurappa, to be summoned by Lokayukta police for questioning.

He called for urgent amendment in waqf laws to prevent the waqf board from claiming ownership of properties of Hindus.BJP state president, B Y Vijayendra, who led the protests in Ballari, said: ""During Lok Sabha elections, PM Narendra Modi had warned that if Congress was voted to power, it would take over properties of Hindus. His words are coming true now.""Vijayendra termed as an eyewash the CM's order to withdraw the notices issued to farmers, marking their land as waqf properties.

""Why are they silent on those notices now?""Karnataka's opposition leader R Ashoka has written to Union home minister Amit Shah and JPC chairman Jagadambika Pal, demanding ""immediate cessation"" of all land registrations to waqf board in the state till the JPC proceedings are on.

CHAIBASA: PM Narendra Modi launched Monday his campaign for Jharkhand’s assembly elections, urging voters to reject what he called the “politics of false guarantees” promoted by Congress and JMM.Modi accused both parties of making unfulfilled promises that have allegedly left many states financially strained. “Since Independence, Congress has constructed its political foundation on public deception,” Modi said, while referencing Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge’s recent remarks on the unsustainability of certain promises.Speaking at rallies in Chaibasa and Garhwa, the PM predicted a NDA victory in Jharkhand and Maharashtra, claiming that voters are poised to respond decisively.He criticised opposition politicians in both states for alleged sexist remarks targeting woman politicians. In Jhark hand, Congress MLA Irfan Ansari from Jamtara had allegedly referred to BJP candidate Sita Murmu as “rejected maal,” while Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Arvind Sawant faced backlash in Maharashtra for calling BJP’s Shaina NC “imported maal”. Sawant later apologised, but Congress and Ansari alleged that BJP circulated a “doctored” video to discredit them.Modi linked these remarks to a broader pattern: “Congress and its ilk are in the habit of such demeaning acts against women… people will teach them a lesson now in these elections.”Modi asserted that a BJP led NDA govt would prioritise the protection of “Beti, Roti aur Mati (daughters, food, and land)”, which he claimed were under threat under the current Hemant Soren-led alliance govt. “I can perceive the transformation that is destined to occur on Nov 23. Mati, Beti, Roti ki Pukar, Jharkhand mein NDA sarkar,” he pro claimed in Garhwa.In Chaibasa, Modi intensified his appeal to the tribal voters of the Kolhan region, an area dominated by the Ho tribe, comprising 14 assembly seats, nine reserved for ST and one for SC. Reflecting on violence against tribal people or “golikaands”, Modi alleged that RJD historically opposed Jharkhand’s creation during Bihar’s undivided era.“JMM is now sitting in the lap of Congress and RJD, both anti-tribal parties, solely driven by their hunger for power and tribal exploitation. Unlike them, BJP established this state in 2000,” Modi said, calling for Kolhan’s people to “rise again against anti-tribal forces”.The PM also alleged demographic shifts in Jharkhand due to infiltration, which he said JMM and its INDIA bloc partners were supporting to secure electoral gains. “Whilst the nation harbours no expectations from Congress, it’s imperative to deliver a fitting response to JMM for their silence over tribal atrocities due to vote-bank politics,” he said.The PM’s rally followed BJP’s release of a 25-point manifesto for Jharkhand, unveiled Sunday by Amit Shah who pledged to identify and deport illegal Bangladeshi immigrants accused of encroach ing on tribal lands.Modi praised the manifesto, asserting its alignment with Centre’s goals, including a commitment to filling three lakh govt jobs without any recruitment exam irregularities such as question paper leaks. “Under the Hemant govt, the exam process in the past five years has been outsourced to the paper-leak mafia. However, Modi shall not tolerate such activities and each perpetrator shall face consequences,” he warned.In response to Modi’s remarks, JMM and Congress accused him of misleading voters. JMM rebuffed BJP’s criticism of “dynastic politics” within INDIA bloc, pointing out that BJP itself has nominated candidates from political families, including relatives of former CMs Madhu Koda, Arjun Munda, and Champai Soren, as well as the daughter-in-law of Odisha governor Raghubar Das.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi launches campaign for Jharkhand assembly elections.

NEW DELHI: After facing backlash for allegedly referring to Shiv Sena candidate Shaina NC as "" imported maal "" in the upcoming Maharashtra assembly polls , UBT faction MP Arvind Sawant claimed on Friday that he did not mention Shaina's name and said that he is the true victim of defamation . His defence came after a police complaint filed by Shaina against him at Nagpada Police Station earlier in the day.Sawant clarified that his remark was aimed at outsiders not being suitable for the local context, emphasising that Shaina is a friend he respects.""I never mentioned her name. I only said that someone who is an outsider will not be able to work here.

She warned, ""Now you will be 'behaal' because you called a woman 'maal'.""Shaina condemned the ""objectification of women"" and noted Congress MLA Amin Patel's reaction to the comment.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.
