Fadnavis accused the elected members of the opposition of insulting the voters who had chosen them by refusing to take their oaths as MLAs.""The voters have voted for these members of the opposition to represent them in the assembly. By refusing to take oath as the members of legislative assembly, these elected representatives have insulted the voters across the state who have voted for them,"" Fadnavis told reporters.The boycott was led by the Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance , which includes prominent opposition parties like Shiv Sena (UBT) and the NCP led by Sharad Pawar.The leaders of these parties, including Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray , voiced their concerns regarding the fairness of the recent elections.Thackeray accused the Election Commission of allowing ""misuse of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs)"" during the state assembly elections.Speaking to the media, Thackeray said, ""We have decided that our winning MLAs will not take the oath today to protest the misuse of EVMs. If this was truly the mandate of the people, there would have been celebrations across the state, but no such celebrations have taken place.""He continued, saying, ""Democracy is being murdered by the use of EVMs. This election result is not the will of the public; it is the result of the EVM and the Election Commission.""In response to the opposition's claims, Maharashtra deputy chief minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar dismissed the allegations as baseless.

Mamata Banerjee says ready to lead INDIA bloc. Is opposition open to rejig?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mamata-banerjee-says-ready-to-lead-india-bloc-is-opposition-open-to-rejig/articleshow/116071579.cms,"File photo



TMC plays out performance card

Congress's MVA allies on board with Mamata

Congress calls it 'good joke'



All not well in INDIA bloc?

NEW DELHI: Two big setbacks in crucial Haryana and Maharashtra state elections have cracked open a wide schism in the opposition INDIA bloc over the ""functioning issue"", with West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee explicitly expressing willingness to take charge of the anti-BJP alliance .Mamata Banerjee, who is also Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo, said she was ready to lead the opposition bloc from Bengal if asked to do so.""I formed the INDIA alliance. Those who don’t like me will always find faults. They may not like me... But if I were given the responsibility. However, I don’t want it. I don’t want to leave Bengal. I was born here, and I will take my last breath here because I love Bengal so much. But I believe that I can manage this even from here,"" Mamata Banerjee said in an interview.Mamata's suggestion to rejig the opposition apparently may not go well with the Congress, which is currently the bloc's de facto leader and the largest party among its allies with 99 MPs in Lok Sabha.TMC MP Kirti Azad claimed Mamata Banerjee was better to lead the INDIA bloc she took on the BJP heads on in the state polls. Azad said the West Bengal CM has the ""perfect record against BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi"".""Mamata Banerjee has a perfect record. Whenever Narendra Modi has faced defeat, it has always been in West Bengal. Even in the recent by-elections, where the BJP had one seat and we had five, Mamata Didi hit a six and threw Narendra Modi out of the West Bengal boundary. Every time he comes to Bengal intending to insult, his vote count increases, and she, a very senior leader, continues to clearly express her views,"" Azad said.Another TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee said that the whole alliance failed to meet expectations in the absence of a leader.""Today, if we genuinely want to fight against the BJP and Narendra Modi, the INDIA alliance must be stronger. To achieve that, one decisive leader is necessary. The key question now is: who will that leader be?"" Banerjee said, hinting at Mamata Banerjee as a potential contender to challenge the BJP and PM Modi.Conversely, the Congress lost the Haryana polls, which it considered a low-hanging fruit. Haryana election results swung wildly from a perceived Congress sweep to a winning show by BJP, which beat strong anti-incumbency.BJP secured 48 seats, eight more than its 2019 result, achieving a comfortable majority in the 90-member assembly. The party also surpassed its 2014 score. The Congress claimed 37 seats, increasing its vote share by 11 percentage, but losing the state.While the electoral battle was primarily a Mahayuti versus Maha Vikas Aghadi contest, it was the head-to-head fights between BJP and Congress in 75 constituencies that shaped the larger outcome. BJP steamrolled Congress in 65 seats of these, leaving with a mere 10.Reacting to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee's statement, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut said that they also want her to be a major partner of the INDIA bloc, adding that they will soon go to talk to Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata.""We know this opinion of Mamata ji. We also want her to be a major partner of the INDIA alliance. Whether it is Mamata Banerjee, Arvind Kejriwal or Shiv Sena, we are all together. We will soon go to talk to Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata,"" Sanjay Raut said addressing a press conference.NCP-SP chief Sharad Pawar also backed Mamata for leading the alliance, saying ""she has that capability"".""Yes certainly (she is capable of leading the alliance), she is a prominent leader of this nation... she has that capability.. the elected leaders she sent in the parliament are responsible, dutiful and well aware people... therefore she has the right to say so,"" Sharad Pawar said.Bharamati MP Supriya Sule, who is also Sharad Pawar's daughter, said that her party would be happy if Mamata Banerjee took more responsibility.""Mamata Banerjee is absolutely an integral part of the INDIA alliance. In a vibrant democracy, the opposition has a big role and responsibility, so if she wants to take more responsibility, we will be very happy,"" Supriya Sule told news agency ANI.The Bengal CM's remark suggests that the Congress party , which was beaming with confidence after its enhanced Lok Sabha polls performance, is in the crosshairs of its allies after the humiliating drubbing in Maharashtra and Haryana polls.However, the Congress party has outrightly dismissed the possibility of change in INDIA bloc leadership as a ""good joke"".""That's a good joke,"" Manikam Tagore quipped when asked about Mamata's remarks.The party also questioned the TMC supremo's ability to function as a national leader, given her role as the head of a regional party.""When the TMC won in West Bengal, they tried to expand their network across the country... They struggled a lot. To what extent they succeeded is clear from the fact that someone who couldn't expand her party beyond Bengal—how can she fight on a national level? How can she lead?"" said Congress leader Udit Raj.Amid rumours of a rift in the INDIA bloc after the TMC kept away from the protest on the Adani issue held in Parliament complex by the Congress and other opposition parties, TMC leader in Rajya Sabha Derek O'Brien said: ""Opposition parties are united in their strategy to corner the BJP in Parliament, but they have different tactics.""The TMC has maintained since the beginning of the session that they want Parliament to function and have kept away from the Congress' demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into allegations of bribery against industrialist Gautam Adani. Apart from TMC, Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party (SP) also refrained from joining protests over the Adani issue in Lok Sabha.Another TMC leader, who did not want to be named, told the news agency PTI that the party has been supporting other opposition parties on different issues, like the Samajwadi Party on the Sambhal issue, and the Aam Aadmi Party on the law and order situation in Delhi.In a more intense move, the Samajwadi Party declared on Saturday to quit the opposition MVA in Maharahtra over Shiv Sena (UBT)'s stand on the Babri mosque demolition""An advertisement was given by Shiv Sena (UBT) in a newspaper congratulating those who demolished Babri masjid. His (Uddhav Thackeray) aide has also posted on X hailing the demolition of the mosque,"" , Maharashtra SP chief Abu Azmi said told news agency PTI.""We are quitting the MVA.

Why should we stay with them?”Azmi also said that he is in discussions with Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav regarding the party's future in the coalition.Azmi's comments followed a social media post by Shiv Sena (UBT) MLC Milind Narvekar, which included a photograph of the Babri Masjid demolition and a quote from Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray: ""I am proud of those who did this."" The post also featured images of Uddhav Thackeray and Aaditya Thackeray, prompting Azmi to question the ideological alignment within the MVA.The MVA, an alliance of the Shiv Sena (UBT), Congress, and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), has faced increasing challenges following its defeat in the recent Maharashtra assembly elections. The BJP-led Mahayuti alliance dominated the polls, securing 230 out of 288 seats. In contrast, the MVA managed just 46 seats, with the Congress contributing a mere 16 to the tally.","Samajwadi Party leader Fakhrul Hasan Chaand distanced the national leadership from Maharashtra SP chief Abu Asim Azmi ’s remarks.

The alliance and Congress have completely succumbed under the weight of Rahul Gandhi. Congress and Rahul Gandhi are nothing more than a liability. The sole purpose of the INDI block is to ensure political placement and protect a corrupt clan,” said BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari on Saturday.The responses come after Mamata Banerjee on Friday said she was ready to lead the opposition if asked. “I formed the INDIA bloc; now it is up to those leading the front to manage it. If they can’t run the show, what can I do?” Banerjee said during a television interview. ""I am not leading that front,"" she added. When asked if she would accept leading the opposition front against the BJP-led NDA government, she responded, “If given the opportunity, I would ensure its smooth functioning.”Over the past week, TMC MPs like Kalyan Banerjee and Kirti Azad have urged Congress and other INDIA bloc allies to set aside their egos and recognise Mamata Banerjee as the leader of the opposition alliance . They touted her consistent record of defeating BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in West Bengal.Despite being members of the INDIA bloc, the relationship between the TMC and Congress has often seen rough patches.

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad HC has directed the respondent Hindu side to file its reply within three weeks in response to a petition filed by management committee of Jaunpur's Atala mosque, challenging a local court order.The court had directed registration of a suit which claimed the mosque was originally an ancient Hindu temple ( Atala Devi temple ). Justice Rohit Ranjan Agarwal in his order directed the petitioner to file a rejoinder affidavit within a week after the plaintiffs in the suit, Swaraj Vahini Association (SVA) and Santosh Kumar Mishra, file their reply.SVA and Mishra filed the suit before Jaunpur court seeking a declaration that the disputed property was Atala Devi temple and followers of Sanatan religion had the right to worship there. They also demanded handing over of the disputed property to the Hindu side and a mandatory injunction to restrain non-Hindus from entering the property.Further, the plaintiffs had also sought permission to sue under Order 1 Rule 8 CPC in a representative capacity. This prayer was allowed in May by the impugned order, and the same was upheld by the district judge in an order in Aug. Both the orders were challenged in the petition before HC.The mosque management committee pleaded before HC that the plea was defective, as the plaintiff, a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, was not a juristic person and thus was not competent to file the suit in a representative capacity.","Allahabad HC has directed the respondent Hindu side to file its reply within three weeks in response to a petition.

The political grapevine is abuzz that there are differences brewing between the West Bengal CM and her nephew and Lok Sabha MP Abhishek Banerjee which have the potential to escalate going forward, sources said.On how they perceive the impact of Banerjee's remarks on the leadership of the Congress within the INDIA Alliance, sources said that at this stage the issue of leadership is not a concern as the role of the alliance and its leadership will be most critical only ahead of the next Lok Sabha when they will need to step up the fight against the ruling BJP led NDA.

MUMBAI: Devendra Fadnavis ’s letter to governor CP Radhakrishnan stating he would take oath at 5.30 pm as CM along with two deputy CMs reached Raj Bhavan only at 2.30 pm Thursday, barely three hours before the actual swearing-in, as there was uncertainty until afternoon about whether Eknath Shinde would agree to be sworn in as deputy CM.Tension mounted in BJP camp in the absence of a letter from Shinde till Thursday morning; Shinde has been insisting on portfolios of his choice. However, in the morning, Shiv Sena ’s Uday Samant, Bharat Gogawale, Ravi Phatak and Sanjay Shirsat persuaded him to join the government as deputy CM, stating that the row over allotment of portfolios could be resolved at a later stage. Following their marathon meeting, Shinde agreed to take oath as deputy CM and a letter signed by Shinde was given to Fadnavis.It was then that Fadnavis sent his letter to the governor. Fadnavis could have sent his own name and that of Ajit Pawar on his own to the governor, but he waited for Shinde’s confirmation, sources said.Atop bureaucrat told TOI that the oath-taking event was confirmed only after written communication was received from CM-designate Fadnavis stating he along with Shinde and Ajit would take oath.Elaborating on what had happened earlier, the bureaucrat said that after the meeting of BJP legislature party Wednesday, a delegation comprising Shinde, Ajit and Fadnavis had called on the governor to stake claim for forma tion of the government. The delegation submitted a list of 237 MLAs supporting the Mahayuti. In addition, separate letters were given by BJP legislature party, Shiv Sena legislature party and NCP legislature party pledging support to Mahayuti government. Shinde and Ajit had earlier been elected as legislature party leaders of Sena and NCP, respectively.But in view of reservations expressed by Shinde over portfolios, no letter was given to Raj Bhavan stating Fadnavis would be leader of Mahayuti legislature party. During the interaction with media in the presence of Fadnavis and Ajit, Shinde was non-committal on whether he would join Mahayuti government as deputy CM. “There is no hurry, media will know by evening,” Shinde had said when asked if he would take oath as deputy CM.Sources said Shinde was hopeful he would get the portfolios of his choice and he was reluctant to join the government as deputy CM in the absence of any assurances in this regard.“All formalities were completed after Raj Bhavan received Fadnavis’s letter around 2.30pm, and the oathtaking took place as scheduled. Certainly it was a piquant situation, but there was no embarrassment, and the event passed off peacefully,” the bureaucrat added.Later at a presser, Fadnavis said about Shinde, “I am telling you 100% he wasn’t upset. Once I appealed to him, he accepted. When I was asked to be deputy CM after being CM, I was also reluctant. But I understood that without taking the post in an alliance government, there is a lack of coordination between the party & the government.”",Devendra Fadnavis’s letter to governor CP Radhakrishnan stated he would take oath at 5.30 pm as CM along with two deputy CMs. Tension mounted in BJP camp in the absence of a letter from Eknath Shinde till Thursday morning.
