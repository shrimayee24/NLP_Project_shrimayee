HC: Axe judge who acquitted man in 3 cases sans judgment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-axe-judge-who-acquitted-man-in-3-cases-sans-judgment/articleshow/120777018.cms,"BHOPAL/JABALPUR: Madhya Pradesh HC has upheld the dismissal of a civil judge who acquitted the accused in three cases without writing an order. He also adjourned proceedings in two cases without passing an order.Hearing a petition filed by the accused judge, Mahendra Singh Taram , the bench comprising Chief Justice Suresh Kumar Kait and Justice Vinay Jain held him guilty of ""grave professional misconduct"" and said his dismissal from service was appropriate.Taram's petition said he had joined as a trainee civil judge class-II at Narsinghpur in July 2003. After training, he was posted at Naugaon in Chhatarpur district and then at Nivas in Mandla district. On HC's recommendation, he was dismissed from service in 2014. He presented a rejoinder against the dismissal order, but it was rejected, after which he filed a writ petition.Taram pleaded that in addition to work pressure, he was passing through personal problems, and because of his situation, he might have committed some mistakes in discharging his duties. Taram's petition argued that while another civil judge had been let off for similar mistakes with only two annual increments withheld, he had been dismissed from the job.The division bench went through the judge's records and saw that a vigilance team of MP HC, during an inspection in 2012, had found that Taram had acquitted the accused in three criminal cases without writing a final judgment and adjourned proceedings in two cases without writing an order. Following this, he was issued a show-cause notice and a departmental enquiry (DE) was conducted against him.The enquiry officer found him guilty on all five points included as terms of reference in the DE. It was then that MP HC recommended his dismissal from service. HC held him guilty of grave professional misconduct and dismissed his petition, upholding the termination of service.","Madhya Pradesh HC has upheld the dismissal of a civil judge.

"In a relief for Nitin Gadkari, SC junks SLPs on 2019 Lok Sabha polls",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-a-relief-for-nitin-gadkari-sc-junks-slps-on-2019-lok-sabha-polls/articleshow/120777007.cms,"NAGPUR: SC Wednesday dismissed a bunch of special leave petitions challenging a 2021 order of Nagpur bench of Bombay HC that struck down portions of an election petition against Union minister Nitin Gadkari 's 2019 Lok Sabha victory.A bench comprising Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh upheld HC's application of procedural law, concluding there were no grounds to interfere. The petitions were filed by former Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole, who lost to Gadkari in 2019 general election, Nagpur voter Nafis Khan, and other candidates.Although Gadkari was re-elected to LS from Nagpur in 2024 polls, the court decided to hear the matter on merit. It also directed Nagpur bench to expedite proceedings in the original 2019 election petition, which has been pending for over five years, the petitioners' counsel Shakul Ghatole told TOI.The case stems from accusations that Gadkari, while filing his nomination in 2019, failed to fully disclose his assets and under-reported campaign expenditure, allegedly violating the Representation of People Act, 1951. In response, Gadkari filed a plea seeking deletion of certain paragraphs from the petition.Khan's counsel argued that HC prematurely purged substantive content from the petition and failed to assess pleadings holistically. He cited precedents to assert that arguable claims should not be struck down solely on perceived weakness. SC found no merit in these submissions and upheld HC's reasoning, reiterating that courts are empowered to eliminate material that is unnecessary or obstructive to fair adjudication.","The case stems from accusations that Gadkari, while filing his nomination in 2019, failed to fully disclose his assets and under-reported campaign expenditure, allegedly violating the Representation of People Act, 1951.

Rekhi sought the boy's release from what he called the illegal custody of the mother, who had taken the child while his father was away on a business trip to Belgium.""For an act to amount to kidnapping, it is necessary that the minor is taken from the custody of a ' lawful guardian '.

The petitioner also alleged she intended to take the child to Australia, where she currently resides.The mother told the court she came to India because the boy had been left in the care of house help and had requested her presence. She produced call logs and messages exchanged with the child and argued that as his mother and natural guardian, she retains custody rights until the pending guardianship case before Gurgaon family court is resolved.""It would be just and prudent for this court to take into account the wishes and well-being of the detenu, who is 12 years old, and capable of forming a rational opinion about his living situation,"" the HC said, siding with the mother.","Punjab and Haryana HC rules a parent cannot be charged with kidnapping her own child.

14 killed as massive blaze turns Kolkata hotel into gas chamber,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/14-killed-as-massive-blaze-turns-kolkata-hotel-into-gas-chamber/articleshow/120776572.cms,"Windows sealed, people outside were unaware of fire



KOLKATA: A six-storey hotel nestled within central Kolkata's congested Mechhua wholesale fruit market caught fire on Tuesday evening, quickly turning into a gas chamber that killed 14 people trapped inside, 13 of them guests.All the victims, barring a staffer who jumped to his death in a bid to escape the smoke and another who suffered fatal burns, died of asphyxiation, officials said. Three of the deceased were from a Chennai family that had returned the previous night from a holiday in Darjeeling and Sikkim.Malfunctioning smoke detectors and sprinklers in the 42-room Rituraj Hotel with 88 guests accentuated how unsafe the building was, police said. The hotel had been allegedly functioning over the past three years without the stipulated NOC from fire services department.The fire is suspected to have started in the banquet area on the first floor that was being converted into a dance bar. The state govt set up a special investigation team to probe the blaze after unapproved structural changes were detected within the building, whose owners are absconding.Fire brigade officials said they received the first call from the hotel at 8.10pm Tuesday, shortly after staffer Manoj Kumar Paswan leapt off a ledge and became the first victim. It was only after seeing him jump that locals realised the hotel was on fire.“Since all the windows on the first floor and that of several rooms in the floors above were sealed, nobody outside realised the hotel had caught fire till around 30 minutes later. Inside the hotel, too, guests and hotel staff did not get wind of the blaze till smoke filled the stairwell, corridors, and started seeping into the rooms,” a fireman said.Fire brigade personnel were able to enter the hotel only five hours later. They found 12 people dead in the rooms and the corridor. Another victim collapsed and died after reaching the terrace. Post-mortem reports suggested they died of carbon monoxide poisoning.CM Mamata Banerjee , who was in the sea resort of Digha, took stock of search and rescue efforts with Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim and police commissioner Manoj Verma. “Investigation has been ordered. My condolences to the victim families and solidarity for all affected,” she wrote on X.PM Narendra Modi condoled the deaths and announced ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh to the next of kin of each of the victims and Rs 50,000 for each of those injured.Hakim said Wednesday that illegal portions of the hotel would be demolished.","All the victims, barring a staffer who jumped to his death in a bid to escape the smoke and another who suffered fatal burns, died of asphyxiation.

Caste census move comes a day after PM-Bhagwat meet



New Delhi: In a politically significant and surprising move, the Modi govt Wednesday decided to include caste enumeration in the upcoming decennial census, a first such exercise in more than 90 years. The Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs (CCPA) decision should also clear the way for the much-awaited census.It comes ahead of elections in caste-sensitive Bihar and amid a govt-opposition tussle over leadership of the numerically predominant and politically significant OBC community . It also snatches a major talking point from Congress, especially with Rahul Gandhi repeatedly taking it up and making it virtually the chief issue in the opposition's armoury.At a press conference, I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said Congress talked about it - with then PM Manmohan Singh telling LS that the matter will be considered by the cabinet - but did not act.During UPA tenure, a socio-economic and caste census had been done and later, some states, including Bihar, Telangana and Karnataka, have undertaken surveys.Vaishnaw accused some of the opposition-led states of conducting caste surveys for political reasons and said Modi govt had resolved to transparently include caste enumeration in the forthcoming pan-India census exercise. “This demonstrates that our govt is committed to the values and interests of our society and country, like in the past when our govt had introduced 10% quota for the economically weaker sections of the society without causing stress in any section of society,” he said.In a post on X, home minister Amit Shah called it “a message of strong commitment towards social equality and rights of every section”. Rahul described it as a “sudden decision” that came after it was opposed by the ruling party for 11 years. “We support this completely, but we want a timeline. We want to know by when it will be done,” he said.BJP fielded big guns from OBC community, including agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Dharmendra Pradhan to describe it as a decision towards ensuring social justice . Coming months before Bihar polls, the CCPA decision has injected a new element into the political scenario and opposition will no longer be able to blame govt for opposing a caste census. It came a day after RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat met PM Modi.Sources said the questions on caste and sub-castes would be part of the national census expected next year. The 2020 Census has been delayed due to Covid-19 pandemic.",The Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs (CCPA) decision should also clear the way for the much-awaited census.

What was Congress's position when Mandal Commission report was presented? Congress has always opposed caste census .""BJP allies were unanimous in greeting Modi govt's announcement. Bihar CM Nitish Kumar hailed the development as a matter of ""great happiness"", while TDP chief CM N Chandrababu Naidu said it underscored PM Modi's ""deep commitment"" to inclusive governance.

The Congress MP said caste census is required to know participation of weaker sections in institutions and power structure, so that they can be given ""access to power"".As he dubbed caste census ""a first step...a big step"" in changing the development paradigm, Rahul demanded the govt abolish the 50% limit on reservations and immediately implement caste quotas in private educational institutions, in line with the Constitutional amendment of Article 15(5).But the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha expressed ""immediate suspicion"" that the govt on the census will adopt a ""strategy on timeline"" as in the women's reservation bill, suggesting that its execution will be kept open-ended.Claiming BJP was forced to change its stance under Congress pressure, Rahul mocked, ""PM Modi used to say there are only four castes but now suddenly announced caste census"". He was referring to Modi's election speeches, in which the PM, rubbishing the demand for caste census, said the only four castes that exist for him are ""women, youth, poor, farmers"". Rahul, who has turned caste census into a sort of mascot of Congress's growing social justice platform over the past two years, held a presser to react to the govt announcement - indicating that he views it as a victory with evidence that ""BJP can be pressured"". He asserted that Congress pushed the demand with a massive grassroots campaign, which had its effect on the govt. ""We welcome the decision. It is our vision, they have adopted it,"" Rahul said. Rahul said unlike Bihar, Telangana's caste census is the model for doing the exercise, as the questions were crystallised through public consultation and not decided by bureaucrats.He offered to Modi govt Congress's help in finalising the design of the census.","Rahul Gandhi calls caste census ""a first step...a big step"" in changing the development paradigm.
