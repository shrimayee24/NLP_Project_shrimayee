NEW DELHI: Giving a boost to BJP and its allies in bypolls at 48 assembly seats across 15 states, NDA emerged the dominant force, securing 26 seats.Among the big wins was UP's Kundarki constituency, which BJP picked up after 31 years. The seat had remained an SP stronghold since 2012.Continuing its dominance in Assam, BJP-led NDA secured all five seats, while the lone seat of Gambegre in Meghalaya was won by its ally NPP. BJP won Samaguri - a Congress bastion since 2001- for the first time with party nominee Diplu Ranjan Sarmah defeating Dhubri MP Rakibul Hussain's son Tanzil Hussain.Congress was somewhat redeemed by news from Karnataka and Punjab. In Punjab, while AAP retained three out of four seats, Congress wrested Barnala from AAP.In Karnataka, Nikhil Kumaraswamy and Bharath Bommai, the third generation of Gowda and Bommai family respectively, lost, as the ruling Congress swept all three bypolls, including wresting Channapatna from JD(S). This seat was held by former CM H D Kumaraswamy in 2023 before he vacated it after winning the Lok Sabha polls in 2024. Congress' C P Yogeeshwara won the Channapatna segment defeating Nikhil Kumaraswamy, while Bharath Bommai lost to Congress' Yasir Ahmed Khan Pathan in Shiggaon.In Sikkim, Aditya Golay (Tamang) and Satish Chandra Rai, both from Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM), won uncontested.The bypoll results highlight a fragmented political landscape, with regional parties like TMC and AAP continuing to assert their influence, and BJP continuing its dominance in Assam, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.There were nine bypolls in all in Uttar Pradesh with BJP winning six seats and its ally RLD securing another. SP continued its dominance in its stronghold of Karhal (since 1993) and Sishamau (since 2012). In West Bengal, TMC swept all six seats in the state, including wresting Madarihat from BJP.The two Parliamentary bypolls saw contrasting Congress victories. While Priyanka Gandhi won the Wayanad seat in Kerala vacated by her brother Rahul Gandhi with a staggering margin, Congress candidate Ravindra Chavan scraped through after defeating BJP's Santukrao Marotrao Hambarde in a keen contest in Nanded in Maharashtra.","BJP picked up Kundarki constituency, which had remained an SP stronghold since 2012.

MUMBAI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday said there is no race for the chief minister's post in Mahayuti .He told TOI, ""We have secured an unprecedented victory. It was a tsunami of a different kind, and the entire opposition has almost been wiped out, but there is no race for the CM's post. The decision on the new CM will be taken by senior netas of Shiv Sena, NCP and the BJP high command.""Fadnavis attributed Mahayuti's victory to the faith of the people of Maharashtra in the leadership of PM Narendra Modi . ""It's a fact that during the Lok Sabha elections, our performance was not up to the mark. In the post-LS polls period, people realised BJP was targeted by divisive and anti-national forces. They took revenge and voted in favour of Mahayuti. We are grateful to the people of Maharashtra for expressing confidence in Modi's leadership,"" he said.Fadnavis said Modi's slogan of 'ek hain toh safe hain,' combined with the Ladki Bahin scheme, was the game-changer. ""With the slogan, people indeed felt they were safe under the leadership of Modi. As a result, even on the day of polling, the electorate took the view 'ek hain toh safe hain' and 'Mahayuti hain toh safe hain,'"" he said.He added the Ladki Bahin scheme was ""implemented in letter and spirit and in future too, payment will be made as per schedule."" He said the priority of the new govt would be to complete ongoing infrastructure projects in a time-bound manner. ""We are determined to complete projects on schedule and to develop Mumbai as a world-class city,"" he said.Fadnavis said Mahayuti had to pay a heavy price for its failure to reply to fake narratives set by MVA politicians during LS polls. ""We took note of it and replied to all the fake narratives with full force, and we made it clear to people how MVA was misleading them,"" he added.Fadnavis said MVA had alleged Mahayuti was set to abolish reservations and make changes to the Constitution. ""We were able to successfully impress upon the people that it was BJP which ensured implementation of Dr Ambedkar's Constitution. People were convinced; therefore, they voted for us,"" he said.Fadnavis also said all-out efforts were made to divide people in the name of religion and caste during Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra, but Mahayuti thwarted all attempts with Modi's slogan 'ek hain toh safe hain.' ""We united all communities and people from all walks of life,"" he noted.Further, Fadnavis said farmers too were taken for a ride by MVA with its fake narratives, but BJP convinced them and submitted to them that BJP would tackle the agrarian crisis as top priority.","Fadnavis attributed Mahayuti's victory to the faith of the people of Maharashtra in the leadership of PM Narendra Modi.

NAGPUR: While the electoral battle was primarily a Mahayuti versus Maha Vikas Aghadi contest, it was the head-to-head fights between BJP and Congress in 75 constituencies that shaped the larger outcome. BJP emerged victorious in 65 seats of these, leaving Congress with a mere 10.The assembly election, coming months after the Lok Sabha polls in which Congress staged an impressive comeback, winning 17 of 48 seats - its best performance in a decade, saw BJP make a stunning recovery. It clinched 132 of the 288 seats, its highest-ever tally in Maharashtra, surpassing previous records of 122 in 2014 and 105 in 2019. Congress plummeted to its worst-ever performance, winning only 15, a steep decline from 44 in 2019 and 42 in 2014.BJP's triumph can be attributed to a coordinated campaign in which its state and central brass worked in tandem. While deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis and state unit chief Chandrashekar Bawankule worked across regions, providing support to every candidate, seasoned campaigners like Narendra Modi, Amit Shah, Nitin Gadkari and Yogi Adityanath provided the necessary impetus to counter anti-incumbency.RSS played a key role, mobilising grassroots support through an extensive campaign involving over 60,000 meetings statewide. This effort helped consolidate votes and neutralise caste-based strategies employed by the opposition. BJP also benefited from its well-organised campaign machinery, which ensured effective candidate selection, voter outreach, and seamless coordination with allies.Congress's campaign was marred by infighting, lack of grassroots mobilisation, and an inability to project a credible leadership figure. Even veterans like Balasaheb Thorat and Prithviraj Chavan lost their seats. Of the 75 face-offs with BJP, Congress managed to win only 10 seats, mostly in areas with significant minority populations or where local netas had a stronghold. In the Konkan region, it has no MLAs left; in north Maharashtra, western Maharashtra and Marathwada, it now has one each. State Congress chief Nana Patole himself barely managed to retain his Sakoli seat, winning by a margin of 208 votes.","BJP clinched 132 of 288 seats, its highest-ever tally in Maharashtra.

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Uddhav Thackeray 's bold decision to challenge the BJP in 2019 and form an alliance with the Congress and NCP has resulted in a significant electoral setback in the Maharashtra assembly elections, where his Shiv Sena (UBT) secured only 20 out of 95 contested seats. He expressed surprise at the electorate's dramatic shift in preference, considering their rejection of the BJP-led alliance merely five months ago in Lok Sabha elections.The political journey of Bal Thackeray's reserved son has been notable. He successfully overcame challenges from Narayan Rane and his cousin Raj Thackeray, eventually becoming Maharashtra's chief minister in November 2019 after dissolving the long-standing BJP alliance post-assembly elections.During the Covid-19 crisis, Uddhav established a strong connection with the public through social media platforms like Facebook live, presenting himself as a reassuring leader.Despite receiving acclaim for his pandemic management, he failed to recognise growing dissatisfaction within his party regarding the alliance with former ideological opponents. Eknath Shinde 's rebellion in June 2022 resulted in his government's collapse and a party split. Nevertheless, Uddhav maintained his criticism of the BJP, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and those he termed ""traitors"" who aligned with Shinde. His party's performance in the Lok Sabha elections was modest, winning nine out of 21 contested seats.Critics have pointed out his limited accessibility, with even ally Sharad Pawar commenting on his tendency to work from home during his chief ministership. However, Uddhav gained support from previously distant communities, including Muslims and Dalits, and developed his own distinctive speaking style, different from his father's but equally sharp.Following the BJP-Shiv Sena-NCP alliance's decisive victory, chief minister Eknath Shinde declared it settled the question of Shiv Sena's legitimate leadership. The 64-year-old Uddhav and his son Aaditya now face the task of maintaining their remaining support base and challenging Shinde's claim to Bal Thackeray's legacy, while defending their alliance with the 'secular' Congress and NCP.Will he be able to make a comeback from this?",Uddhav Thackeray's Shiv Sena secured only 20 out of 95 contested seats.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Saturday celebrated BJP's spectacular win in Maharashtra as a triumph of his platform of unity, development and over INDIA bloc's politics of ""divisiveness, negativity and deceit"", as he sought to elevate his 'ek hain to safe hain' theme as the country's new ""mahamantra"".""After Haryana, the biggest message of this election is unity. 'Ek hain to safe hain' has become the 'mahamantra' of the country,"" a triumphant Modi said while addressing a celebration at the BJP headquarters. While hailing BJP's landslide, Modi framed the Maharashtra result as a defeat of Congress's focus on caste and said it was the message of unity, which triumphed in the state. ""It has taught a lesson to those who make people fight in the name of caste, religion, language and region,"" he said.PM Modi said electoral victory in Maharashtra was not just for BJP but for a vision of India that prioritised unity and development. This victory, Modi said, was a clear rejection of Congress and ""INDI alliance's"" agenda, which he accused of dividing society.Modi also took the opportunity to critique opposition's governance model, particularly focusing on Congress-led states. He cited examples like Karnataka, Telangana and Himachal where, he claimed, promises made by Congress were unfulfilled, drawing parallels to the electorate's disillusionment with such politics. ""People of Maharashtra saw how Congress govts are betraying people,"" he said, positioning BJP's governance as a stark contrast.The scale of BJP's win was unprecedented in Maharashtra, with Modi proudly declaring it ""biggest victory for any party or pre-poll alliance in the state in the past 50 years"". This wasn't just a political win but a mandate for BJP's continued governance, marking the third consecutive victory in the state, he added. ""For the third time, BJP has emerged as the largest party in Maharashtra,"" he said.He criticised Congress for its 'duplicity', especially concerning figures like Veer Savarkar, who, he said, was insulted and misrepresented by the rival for political gains. He said Maharashtra election had exposed the ""double face of INDI-Aghadi"".Modi also touched upon the issue of urban Naxalism, labelling it as a new challenge, with its roots allegedly outside the country, and urged the youth to recognise this reality. The PM also reflected on the losses, like in Jharkhand, as a call for more dedicated effort in development.","PM Narendra Modi hails BJP's spectacular win in Maharashtra as a triumph of his platform of unity, development and over INDIA bloc's politics of ""divisiveness, negativity and deceit"" Modi said electoral victory in Maharashtra was not just for BJP but for a vision of India that prioritised unity and development.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115611129,imgsize-1483536,width-400,resizemode-4/115611129.jpg"

DEHRADUN: Days after six youths were killed in a collision between their MUV and a container truck near ONGC Chowk in Dehradun, police arrested the truck driver in UP's Saharanpur Friday. The driver had fled the scene abandoning the truck.The impact of the accident was so severe that six of the seven occupants in the MUV, including three women aged 19-24, had died on the spot.Two of the youngsters were decapitated. The lone survivor is still in hospital, and unable to talk much. Initial probe suggested that the MUV which was being driven at a speed of over 120km/h, had hit the truck's left rear side when the latter was crossing a intersection at normal speed.Police said the truck driver is Ram Kumar, 34, of Saharanpur. Dehradun SSP Ajai Singh said Kumar had fled to evade police. ""During interrogation, he told police that he fled out of fear after seeing the extent of the accident and the victims' bodies scattered on the road,"" said the SSP.Kumar also confessed to removing the truck's registration plate before fleeing.",Six youths were killed in a collision between their MUV and a container truck in Dehradun.

They and other minorities helped the opposition Mahavikas Agahadi (MVA) win big in the Lok Sabha polls in May. But a combination of reduced enthusiasm and split votes, along with communal polarisation, seems to have sent some of those same constituencies to the governing BJP-led Mahayuti alliance.MVA, which includes Congress and Sharad Pawar's NCP, lost seats in Chandivali and Anushakti Nagar in Mumbai, as well as Bhiwandi West, Solapur Central, and Dhule - all constituencies with more than 20% Muslim population.""The minorities did not vote en bloc and they did not show as much enthusiasm in voting as they had during the Lok Sabha poll. This resulted in MVA getting hit,"" said Dolphy D'Souza of Bombay Catholic Sabha.Some blamed religious leaders who had given a call to vote for MVA candidates. A few days ahead of the polls, senior cleric and All India Muslim Personal Law Board spokesperson Maulana Sajjad Noamani held a press conference and told community members to support MVA candidates. Not only did the community not heed the clerics' call, said observers, but the move helped BJP strengthen its allegations of ""vote jihad"", or the consolidation of Muslim votes against the Mahayuti.""Maulana Sajjad Noamani should have stuck to guiding the community on religious affairs. His call confused the community and helped BJP polarise the Hindu votes. If the Maulana is interested in politics, he should fight elections,"" said Asif Farooqui, city Congress general secretary.In some seats, the presence of multiple Muslim candidates split votes. For example, in Aurangabad East, AIMIM state chief and former MP Imtiaz Jaleel lost to BJP's Atul Save by 2,161 votes. Save polled 93,274 votes against Jaleel's 91,113. However, Afsar Khan of VBA (6,507 votes) and SP's Abdul Ghaffar Syed (5,943 votes) split the Muslim votes, ensuring Jaleel's defeat. In Bhiwandi West, BJP's Mahesh Choughule defeated SP's Riyaz Azmi by 31,293 as Muslims split their votes also among AIMIM's Waris Pathan (15,800 votes) and independent Vilas Patil (31,579 votes).","Muslims have a sizeable presence in 31 of the 288 assembly seats in Maharashtra.

"After Lok Sabha boost, Maharashtra drubbing sends Congress back to square one",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-lok-sabha-boost-maharashtra-drubbing-sends-congress-back-to-square-one/articleshow/115617032.cms,"NEW DELHI: The euphoria lasted five and a half months flat.After defying the most polarising election campaign by BJP, and posting a creditable performance in the 2024 LS polls that triggered talks of revival and a change in the national mood, Congress Saturday landed back at square one where it had been for a decade.The party has been swept out of Maharashtra and Haryana - battles it was expected to win - while it posted its worst ever tally in J&K despite ally NC's sweep, with the sole bright spot being Jharkhand as a junior ally to JMM, reflecting the crisis associated with it after losing at the Centre in 2014.With Maharashtra and Haryana, Congress has lost the two big solo states that were its best chance to amplify the mood of revival after the LS polls. The party was confident, and the leadership eager, as was visible from the intense campaign. And the agenda was an echo of the LS campaign - Constitution under threat, Adani, caste census, five guarantees, removal of 50% quota cap.As the party tries to make sense of how the mood has changed so irretrievably, the whitewash is bound to add uncertainty about the agenda and strategy that it had felt was sealed for the onward march. And if the party strategists believe a pivot is required on certain issues and a complete junking of some, then Congress' task of reinvention would put it back to the drawing board, messing its plan to move forward with challenging BJP with assurance - a big setback to the post-2024 plans.AICC's Jairam Ramesh insisted Congress would stick to its agenda. But many believe a change is required as ""guarantees-based populism"" has lost its novelty, while the party is not catching the imagination of the aspirational urban and middle-class. Caste census and 50% cap had its best audience in Maharashtra that is mired in myriad quota battles, and a rout there may raise serious doubts within on its political appeal.Though Congress has hinted at ""manipulation"" in both states, many argue allegations against EVMs etc should not be flung about loosely. It would take hope LS would still stay competitive, while there are issues galore to continue the offensive against Modi govt.But setbacks on Congress turfs are bound to demoralise the cadre, which saw a turnaround just five months ago. The immediate Congress challenge would be to convince its workers that the wheels have not come off the party's fight against BJP.The failure to finesse the old poll management style, coupled with lack of control of state satraps and poor communication, are viewed as weaknesses. ""We have forgotten how to win elections,"" an insider said.",The party has been swept out of Maharashtra and Haryana - battles it was expected to win.

PUNE: Soon after the Lok Sabha results in May, NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar travelled the length and breadth of the state to prepare for the assembly poll.During the campaign, he held 55 rallies in less than a month despite his age. However, his efforts failed as his party barely crossed the two-digit mark and faced losses in over 70 seats. This election marked a historic moment where, for the first time in his illustrious political career spanning over six decades, Pawar's party faced defeat in his home constituency of Baramati.Since his first election in 1967, Pawar has never lost an election he contested from Baramati. He introduced his nephew Ajit Pawar from the constituency who also maintained his winning streak. Later, he made way for his daughter Supriya who contested from Baramati and remains undefeated.However, it took a political opponent from the Pawar family to mark his first defeat. NCP chief Ajit Pawar defeated his nephew and Pawar's grandnephew Yugendra by a margin of over one lakh votes.The defeat reflects NCP (SP)'s performance across the state. It exposed inexperienced candidates against established politicians and their efforts fell short.Like Baramati, there were many seats where NCP (SP) did not have strong candidates to take on bigwigs like Chhagan Bhujbal in Yeola, Dilip Walse Patil in Ambegaon, and Dhananjay Munde in Parli. ""Without experienced faces, the party had to either poach candidates from other parties or give chances to new faces. However, most candidates failed to resonate with the voters, and they could not get the desired results,"" a senior NCP (SP) member told TOI.According to political observers, during the Lok Sabha polls, NCP (SP) could connect with the voters on a sentimental issue, but that proved totally ineffective in the assembly election. Parimal Maya Sudhakar, head of MIT-WPU's School of Government, said the sympathy factor was strong for Sharad Pawar's party during the LS poll. It was based on central government's misuse of agencies against his party and that narrative faded away in the assembly election.","Sharad Pawar held 55 rallies in less than a month despite his age.

PUNE: Only two of more than 70 rebels across Maharashtra, who threw their hats into the electoral ring as independents after being sidelined for nominations, managed to secure victories. In Akola West and Partur constituencies, the rebels dented the chances of alliance candidates by polling votes more than the winning margin, assembly election results declared on Saturday show.Sharad Sonawane, who was in the race for a Shiv Sena ticket, defeated NCP(SP)'s Satyahseel Sherkar in Junnar by 6,664 votes. Mahayuti nominee and sitting MLA Atul Benke (NCP) managed to get third spot. Similarly, BJP rebel Shivaji Patil trounced NCP's Rajesh Narsingrao Patil by 24,134 votes to bag Chandgad. Both the constituencies were allocated to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar's faction, which resulted in rebellion within Mahayuti.Among the 4,136 candidates who contested assembly polls this time, 2,096 were independents. However, except for Sonawane and Patil, no other rebels/independents could make a mark. ""People voted against the dynasty politics in Chandgad. It is a victory of common BJP workers. We have planned several initiatives which I will implement in the constituency with the help of the new Mahayuti govt,"" Shivaji Patil told reporters.Supporters of Sonawane claimed CM Eknath Shinde arranged a helicopter to fly him to Mumbai soon after he was declared winner.In Akkalkuwa, former MP Heena Gavit rebelled against BJP, while in Nandgaon, NCP politician and former MLA Sameer Bhujbal contested as an independent after the seats were allocated to Shiv Sena. Gavit stood third and Bhujbal ranked second.In Sangli, Congress's Jayashree Patil received 32,736 votes, while MVA's official candidate Prithviraj Patil lost by 36,135 votes. In Akola West, BJP's Harish Alimchandani got 21,481 votes, significantly higher than the number - 1,283 - Mahayuti nominee Vijay Agrawal would have needed to script victory. Congress rebel Sureshkumar Jethaliya polled 53,921 votes in Partur, spoiling the chances of the Mahayuti candidate who lost by 4,720 votes.In some seats, vote share of rebels - Sena (UBT)'s Priti Sanjay Band in Badnera, NCP(SP)'s Satyajeet Patankar in Patan, and Congress's Rajendra Mulak to name a few - was more than that of alliances' official candidates.","Sharad Sonawane, who was in the race for a Shiv Sena ticket, defeated NCP(SP)'s Satyahseel Sherkar in Junnar by 6,664 votes.

It turned out to be a hollow slogan as the Maratha chieftain faced his biggest electoral defeat as counting closed.It will hurt the man who was the youngest CM of Maharashtra at 38 even more that Ajit, a nephew he groomed, one who later defected, did stunningly well and ended up taking not only party name and symbol, but also his political legacy. In Baramati, a constituency synonymous with Pawar's clout, he could not make another family member - grandnephew Yugendra - win. The latter became the first contestant since 1967 to have lost the Baramati assembly seat despite Pawar Sr's blessings. Gallingly, Ajit Pawar 's NCP eroded Pawar's power base in the sugar bowl of Western Maharashtra, too.Known as a political strategist par excellence with a keen sense of people's pulse, he seemed to miscalculate this poll. On Friday, he told MVA netas that MVA will get a majority and form govt. MVA didn't cross double digits.While some Pawar supporters argued that NCP (SP)'s overall vote share was better than that of Ajit's NCP, the damage was done. ""More than the loss of seats, Pawar's master strategist status has taken a beating and that will hurt,"" an NCP neta told TOI.Pawar was undoubtedly the chief strategist and campaign-in-chief for MVA during the polls.

MUMBAI: In Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Mahayuti achieved significant electoral victories, maintaining their strongholds while reclaiming lost territories and altering established political dynamics.In Kopri-Pachpakhadi, CM Eknath Shinde secured the highest victory margin among four seats within Thane civic boundaries. His Ladki Bahin scheme, benefiting over 1.2 lakh residents, helped him defeat his mentor Anand Dighe's nephew and UBT's Kedar Dighe by 1.2 lakh votes. ""The opposition spent the last two years levelling allegations against us. We responded with constructive work,"" Shinde said.In Ovala-Majiwada, three-term MLA Pratap Sarnaik secured 1.8 lakh votes, defeating UBT's Naresh Manera by 1.08 lakh votes. BJP's Sanjay Kelkar retained Thane for the third time, securing 1.2 lakh votes against UBT's Rajan Vichare, while MNS's Avinash Jadhav finished third. Belapur saw a nail-biting finish with BJP MLA Manda Mhatre retaining her seat with a wafer thin margin of 377 votes against NCP (SP)'s Sandeep Naik. She polled 91,852 votes and Naik 91,475.In Palghar district, Mahayuti took five of the six seats. BJP and Shiv Sena candidates overcame three BVA incumbents-Hitendra Thakur, Kshitij Thakur and Rajesh Patil-in Vasai, Nalasopara and Boisar. Sena's Rajendra Gavit won in Palghar against UBT's newcomer Jayendra Dubla. In Vikramgad, BJP's Harishchandra Bhoye prevailed over NCP (SP)'s Sunil Bhusara. CPI(M)'s Vinod Nikole narrowly retained Dahanu with a lead of 5,133 votes. The seat also recorded 5,120 NOTA votes, one of the highest in MMR.In Mira-Bhayander, BJP's Narendra Mehta won with 1.44 lakh votes, beating Congress's Muzaffar Hussain and ex-BJP member Geeta Jain.Mahayuti's success continued in Kalyan: it kept four seats and added Kalyan Rural. MVA's sole victory there came from Mumbra-Kalwa, where Jitendra Awhad secured his fourth term. Ravindra Chavan scored the highest margin among six seats in Kalyan.In Bhiwandi, Mahayuti secured five seats. SP representative Rais Shaikh won Bhiwandi East.

Modi said ‘ek hain...’ & Maha said ‘safe hain’: Muslim polarisation ran into silent consolidation of Hindus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assembly-elections-modi-said-ek-hain-maharashtra-said-safe-hain-muslim-polarisation-ran-into-silent-consolidation-of-hindus/articleshow/115616179.cms,"NEW DELHI: After surprise setbacks in several key constituencies in Maharashtra in Lok Sabha polls this year, BJP found itself at a crossroads, needing to recalibrate its strategy to regain lost ground. Polarisation of Muslim votes against it led to significant losses for BJP in at least seven constituencies in the Lok Sabha polls that included Dhule and Mumbai North-East, where the saffron party had previously enjoyed strong support.In the wake of these results, BJP, under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, initiated a campaign aimed at not just reclaiming these lost territories but also redefining its image. The PM introduced a new rallying cry, ""ek hain to safe hain"" (together we are safe), a slogan designed to resonate with the Hindu electorate, emphasising unity as a defence against division. This was not merely about communal unity but was portrayed as a broader appeal for national cohesion under BJP's stewardship. The call seems to have resulted in silent consolidation of Hindu votes in favour of BJP and its allies.The slogan was a direct counter to the narrative set by the opposition and was complemented by another slogan from UP CM Yogi Adityanath, ""batenge to katenge"" (divided we fall), which further hammered the message of unity for survival. These slogans were intended to reassure Hindu voters in areas where they felt their political influence was waning due to consolidation of minority votes.BJP's narrative was bolstered by the activities of Muslim clerics, who called for Muslim votes to be consolidated behind the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). This move was seen by BJP as an opportunity to validate its call for Hindu unity . The demands from National Ulema Council, Maharashtra, and All India Muslim Personal Law Board member Sajjad Nomani, which included quotas for Muslims in govt contracts and preference in recruitment for police forces, only intensified BJP's campaign.Opposition from Hindu seers was swift, interpreting these demands as divisive. The political atmosphere was already charged when protests by Muslim youth in front of 'Matoshree' forced Shiv Sena (UBT) to reconsider its position on the waqf bill, highlighting the delicate balance of communal politics in the region.As the election campaign progressed, BJP's strategy evolved into a narrative of safeguarding cultural and national unity against perceived threats of division. Party leaders, including PM, engaged in a series of rallies and meetings, emphasising the importance of standing together. The narrative was clear: unity under BJP was the path to safety and progress for the Hindu community, and by extension, for the nation.Saffron fountainhead RSS was also said to be proactive in the polls and it was evident when the two slogans were endorsed by its leadership. RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, in his annual Dussehra address, called for Hindu unity and urged taking lessons from attacks on the community in Bangladesh. Senior Sangh functionary Dattatreya Hosabale also used the slogan ""batenge to katenge"", amplifying the call for Hindu unity.","PM Narendra Modi introduced a new rallying cry, ""ek hain to safe hain"" (together we are safe) The slogan was designed to resonate with the Hindu electorate.

With 88% Strike Rate, Party Wins 15 Of 17 Contested

PUNE: For an election fought primarily on women's empowerment issues, largely the Ladki Bahin Scheme, only 8.8% women candidates were in the fray, and even fewer have won. Just 22 will be a part of the new assembly, down from 24 in 2019, reports Salonee Mistry. Of the 55 women fielded by the two major blocs, 21 Mahayuti faces and one MVA nominee won.In Pune, Parvati saw a tough fight between two women - BJP's Madhuri Misal and NCP (SP)'s Ashwini Kadam. Misal secured the seat with 1,18,193 votes, winning with a margin of 54,660.Other winners included NCP's Aditi Tatkare, who won in Shrivardhan with 1,16,050 votes, Sana Malik in Anushaktinagar, Saroj Ahire in Deolali, BJP's Sneha Dubey Pandit in Vasai and Devayani Harande in Nashik Central, and Shiv Sena's Manjula Gavit in Sakri.Only one woman from the opposition alliance won - Congress' Jyothi Gaikwad in Dharavi constituency.MUMBAI: BJP emerged as the Big Brother in Mumbai, winning 15 of the 17 seats it contested. The party got one seat less than its 2019 victory tally of 16 seats. Shiv Sena (UBT), which faced a wipeout in most of the state, managed to win 10 seats out of the 22 it contested in the city. The party won 20 seats in Maharashtra, so half of their wins came from Mumbai. Sena's (UBT) lone Muslim candidate, Haroon Khan, won from Versova, defeating BJP's sitting MLA Bharti Lavekar. Shiv Sena, led by CM Eknath Shinde, won six seats. It fought 15 seats. Congress, which contested on 10 seats, only managed to win three, down from four sitting MLAs in 2019. NCP (SP) fought two seats in Mumbai and lost both, while the Ajit Pawar-NCP contested two seats and won one - Sana Malik from Anushakti Nagar. MNS failed to bag any seat in Mumbai; in fact, its chief Raj Thackeray's son, Amit, lost from Mahim seat.BJP's Sanjay Upadhaya bagged the Borivli seat with 1,00,057 votes, the highest winning margin in Mumbai, defeating Sena (UBT)'s Sanjay Bhosale. BJP's Mihir Kotecha won Mulund seat by over a 90,000 vote margin. This was nearly 50% more margin than in the Lok Sabha elections from Mulund constituency in May, when he had a 61,000 lead. In Malabar Hill, BJP's Mangal Prabhat Lodha won his 7th election, the only candidate to hold that record in this constituency. He swept the elections with 1,01,197 votes and, with that, garnered the highest vote share of 73.4% among all constituencies of Mumbai.Among other high-profile seats, BJP's Ashish Shelar (Bandra West), Ameet Satam (Andheri West), and Rahul Narwekar (Colaba) got big wins. The Shinde-led Sena lost key seats to Sena (UBT) like Worli, where Aaditya Thackeray won, and Mahim, where Mahesh Sawant defeated sitting MLA Sada Sarvankar. Sena (UBT)'s Varun Sardesai won from Bandra East defeating NCP's Zeeshan Siddique. SP's Abu Azmi won Mankhurd-Shivaji Nagar seat defeating NCP's Nawab Malik. Some of the Sena's candidates who joined from BJP just before the polls, like Shaina NC (Mumbadevi), lost, while Murji Patel (Andheri East) won.Bhandup West witnessed the highest voting percentage at nearly 62.9%, and it was a close contest between Ramesh Korgaonkar of Sena UBT and Ashok Patil of Shiv Sena. While the former was leading during the first 11 rounds, giving an impression that he might easily get re-elected, the tables turned from the 12th round, as Patil surpassed him for the next 9 rounds and won by 6,764 votes.Ghatkopar West seat saw a close fight between three-time BJP MLA Ram Kadam and Sena (UBT)'s Sanjay Bhalerao. Kadam won the seat with a margin of 12,971 votes.The richest candidate in the fray, BJP's Parag Shah, won the second consecutive term with 34,999 votes in Ghatkopar (East). In Kurla, Mangesh Kudalkar of Shiv Sena won his third term by overcoming a tough challenge by Pravina Morajkar of UBT.","Only 8.8% women candidates were in the fray, and even fewer have won.

Jharkhand election results: It's 2019 again for BJP as tribal bastion defies polarisation bid a second time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jharkhand-election-results-its-2019-again-for-bjp-as-tribal-bastion-defies-polarisation-bid-a-second-time/articleshow/115615980.cms,"NEW DELHI: At the peak of his popularity following a massive mandate in Pulwama-powered 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Narendra Modi twisted the knife deeper months later in Jharkhand when he remarked that he could identify rioters by their clothes. It was the trope for polarisation that was expected to build on the mood in his favour and rescue the unpopular BJP in the tribal state. But he could not defy the state's tradition of booting out the incumbent.Five years later, BJP sent three months in advance the fire-breathing Himanta Biswa Sarma and Shivraj Chouhan to prepare the pitch for polarisation with sharp comments around Hindu-Muslim faultline, on which the big guns later batted with their campaigns. But this time, they could not stop the JMM-plus from defying the incumbency handicap.Five years apart, Jharkhand has stood like a rock, stonewalling communalism. On both occasions, tribal face Hemant Soren triumphantly ascending to the helm.The pattern has thrown into sharp relief the unique nature of the state carved out of Bihar, which is known for its tribal character but has a predominant majority of OBCs; where the native party banks on three partners to boost its rainbow alliance, but is ranged against BJP which has a national force and agenda that seeks to overcome the caste divide through religious consolidation.Native leader Soren was the underdog, who was battling the might of the hegemonic BJP machine led by the lifesize image of Modi supported by a strong cast of who's who.A man who, after being under the hammer for over two years, was jailed in an alleged corruption case during the LS polls - the rival plan being to render the underdog rudderless and then overwhelm it. But first Champai Soren, and then Soren's wife Kalpana, stepped up, and effected a tribal consolidation that yielded decent results in the parliamentary polls. Six months later, the mood only soared further.In hindsight, BJP erred in treating Soren like NCP and Shiv Sena or Congress leaders, as it triggered an identity backlash that sank the favourites.Yet, the BJP combo of 'name, network, resources and rhetoric' was a massive challenge to overcome. They were all there - Modi, Amit Shah, Yogi Adityanath and Biswa Sarma. By the looks of it, JMM appealed to the vast populace as the underdog taking on the mighty, as its soft manners and inclusive approach countered the rivals' attempt at religious consolidation. It could only be possible with tribals finding allies in the sprawling OBC bloc and minorities, with a sprinkling of others. The support of 'Maiyya Samman' monthly dole to women, played its role.In the end, Jharkhand would be known as the state that bucked the trend back to back, and kept polarisation at bay.","Five years apart, Jharkhand has stood like a rock, stonewalling communalism. On both occasions, tribal face Hemant Soren triumphantly ascending to the helm.

The significance of these two wins can be gauged from the fact that BJP had won these seats only once each before - Kundarki in 1993 and Katehri in 1991.The other seats BJP won are Khair in Aligarh, Phulpur in Prayagraj, Majhawan in Mirzapur and Ghaziabad Sadar. NDA ally RLD maintained its hold on Meerapur in Muzaffarnagar. For SP, retaining Karhal, part of Akhilesh's pocket borough Mainpuri, and Sishamau in Kanpur was a small consolation for losing the other two.Yogi said BJP-led NDA's landslide in Maharashtra and UP indicated that people have put their stamp on PM Narendra Modi's slogan, ""Ek rahenge, safe rahenge"". If BJP losing Ayodhya in LS polls was seen as a moral defeat, the win in Kundarki would go down as a pleasant surprise.BJP's Ramvir Singh won the seat by 1.4 lakh votes. Such a big win, sources said, would not have been possible without Muslims voting for the BJP candidate.Yogi termed the victory ""a win for nationalism"". SP's victory in Karhal by a relatively lower margin of 14,000 votes compared to 67,000 in 2022, is seen as an erosion of support. Same is the case in Sishamau, where Akhilesh's party won by 8,000-odd votes compared to around 12,000 the last time.Yogi had hit the ground running for the bypolls right after LS setback. He not only appointed ministers to lead the campaign in each constituency, but also visited these places multiple times to drum up support. BJP's assembly tally rose from 255 in 2022 to 257, while SP's slipped from 111 to 107.

MUMBAI: For the first time in six decades, there will be no leader of opposition (LoP) in the Maharashtra legislative assembly owing to an inadequate number of opposition members.As per the provisions of the Salaries and Allowances of Leaders of Opposition in the State Legislature Act, a leader of opposition can be nominated if the party has 10% of the elected members, former principal secretary (legislature) Anant Kalse said.""So, in the 288-member Maharashtra legislative assembly, only if the opposition party has 28 elected members can it nominate the leader of opposition,"" Kalse told TOI.
