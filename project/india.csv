NEW DELHI: The BJP on Thursday launched an attack at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), claiming that its chief Arvind Kejriwal fostered a ""love for bogus voters"". The party further alleged that some AAP leaders and their family members have dual voter registrations .At a press conference, Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva unveiled a poster titled ""Farzi voters se ishq hai"" (In love with fake voters), taking a direct jab at Kejriwal and his party.Sachdeva alleged that AAP MP Sanjay Singh, in his 2018 affidavit for Rajya Sabha, declared himself a voter in Delhi’s Hari Nagar assembly constituency, even though his name also appeared in the voter list of Sultanpur municipality in Uttar Pradesh, his hometown.He further claimed that Singh’s wife, Anita, had applied for the deletion of her voter registration in Sultanpur only on January 4, 2024, days before Singh filed his parliamentary affidavit on January 8, 2024, which still reflected her as a registered voter there.""Sanjay Singh claims that his wife Anita Singh's name was removed from the Sultanpur voter list on January 4, 2024.

The affidavit was submitted on January 8, and until the process is complete, the address remains the same. Once the voter list is updated, the new address will be recorded,"" he added.Sachdeva called for legal action from the Election Commission and Delhi Police against Singh, alleging ""discrepancy"" in voter registration. He also accused Singh of hastily applying for a vote transfer on December 30 after the BJP highlighted the issue.The BJP leader further alleged that Delhi mayor Mahesh Kumar's wife held dual voter registrations under different names from the same address and photo. While no immediate response was available from the mayor, Sachdeva mentioned that a case regarding two voter ID cards allegedly held by Kejriwal's wife was pending in the high court.AAP MP Singh countered these claims by disclosing that he had already filed defamation cases against BJP leaders, including Amit Malviya and Manoj Tiwari, over similar allegations.Taking a dig at Singh, Sachdeva said, ""What dignity does a person have when he is already out on bail and creates double voter registrations even while serving as a Member of Parliament?""","Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva unveiled a poster titled ""Farzi voters se ishq hai"" (In love with fake voters) He claimed that AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal fostered a ""love for bogus voters"" The party further alleged that some AAP leaders and their family members have dual voter registrations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116890626,imgsize-1550680,width-400,resizemode-4/116890626.jpg"
