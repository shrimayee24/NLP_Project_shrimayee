It has since been constantly updated via the EC's voter turnout app as more polling parties returned and submitted their reports, resulting in a 2.2 percentage points jump over the polling day figure. Also, the Phase 6 turnout is now 1.2 percentage points higher than Phase 5 polling, notwithstanding the high temperatures recorded in many of the constituencies that went to polls on Saturday.The turnout data for Phase 6, as available on the EC app at 10 pm on Sunday, is almost final as no repolls were scheduled after scrutiny held on Sunday in the presence of candidates or their agents, sources told TOI.

Also, there was a climb of 4.4 percentage points in Haryana, up from 60.4 per cent at Saturday 11.45 pm to 64.8 per cent on Sunday evening. The uptick was also significant in Odisha; the revised turnout was 4.1 percentage points higher that the 69.6 per cent polling declared by EC towards the end of polling day.West Bengal saw a 3.2 percentage point jump from 79.5 per cent to 82.7%, possibly due to polling parties having taken time to return from the remote polling stations. The rise in turnout in Jharkhand was around 1.6 percentage points, in Bihar 1.9 percentage points, in J&K 0.5 percentage points and in Delhi, 1 percentage points.The turnout figure for UP was almost the same as Saturday.The Commission had on Saturday said it will publish the updated voter turnout figures for Phase 6 by May 30.Turnouts - which are presently based on EVM votes and do not include postal ballots which are counted only on results day - have fluctuated through the phases, with Phase 4 having recorded the highest polling at 69.2%, followed by 66.7 per cent in Phase, 66.1 per cent in Phase and 65.7 per cent in Phase 3.

president J P Nadda tells TOI’s Akhilesh Singh his party is set to retain office with a thumping majority. Excerpts:

Just one phase of polling remains. What is your assessment of BJP and

NDA

's performance?

Which factors do you think are working for BJP?

Reports suggest that BJP is not improving its performance in Tamil Nadu and Kerala and its struggle for a foothold in the two states continues.

What is your reaction to

AAP

's allegation that their Rajya Sabha MP,

Swati Maliwal

, is a 'BJP agent'?

You sound confident that NDA will win 400 seats but reports suggest that BJP is not doing too well in Uttar Pradesh despite there being no SP-BSP alliance like 2019. Moreover, construction of Ram temple has taken place but it seems a sweep by BJP is far-fetched.

Maharashtra and Karnataka played a big role in helping BJP cross 300 seats in 2019. But the political situation in both states has changed.

Similar reports are coming from Rajasthan as well.

Your tenure as BJP president has witnessed induction of outsiders. Don't you think there will be a clash of ambitions and interests and that may translate into disappointment among the old party members?

BJP won 303 seats in 2019 but your target is to win 370 this time, which states do you think the party is improving?

There is discussion that RSS has not been very active in the ongoing polls?

See, BJP on its own has already crossed the majority mark... some guesstimates suggest the party has won 310 seats after five phases. After seven phases, our party is poised to cross 370 seats and NDA will cross 400. The mood across the country is very positive for the BJP-led alliance. Voters trust Narendra Modi and they are voting for BJP to make him PM again. There is no ambiguity among them, which makes us confident of winning with a bigger margin. Even opposition parties have started acknowledging that BJP is winning and they are sounding distressed. Their tone changed from the third phase onwards as they realised that there is a wave for BJP and PM Modi .Modi ji's leadership has been the key factor There is a general feeling, I think unanimity, across the country that PM Modi has brought about a paradigm change across the social spectrum, including the political culture of the country... politics of report card, politics of accountability, performance, last-mile delivery, saturating implementation of social welfare schemes. There is unflinching trust in PM Modi's leadership among diverse sections. Be it educated or semi-educated, urban or rural resident, they have all been beneficiaries and the way global perception about the image of the country has changed has resulted in optimism and enthusiasm. Before 2014, there was indifference towards governance and political leadership of the country. PM Modi changed that. Let me give you a few examples. We entered the poll fray in Tamil Nadu and Kerala in a big way and our candidates had to face entrenched regional players like AIADMK and DMK in TN and the two alliances (LDF, UDF) in Kerala. However, thanks to the Modi factor, we are expecting seats from these states also. If you look at the popularity chart, PM Modi has trumped and there is hardly anyone raising questions about his leadership. Ease of living, and empowerment of women, poor, farmers and youth created a pro-Modi wave. Besides, people are feeling proud about the focus on cultural heritage as we have a slogan 'Vikas Bhi, Virasat Bhi', which underlines our aim to move on with the times and yet remember our legacy.I have no idea about your source of information but let me tell you that our party is going to win seats Tamil Nadu and it could happen in Kerala too. We may not win too many seats but BJP's vote is set to increase significantly. Modi's popularity was seen in both states but translating that popularity into electoral wins takes time as you need a strong local organisation and winnable candidates. However, we are going to break the myth about TN and Kerala being alien territory for us and our footprint there is going to only expand.See, AAP leaders, and I say with full responsibility, are urban Naxals in disguise. And in a way, their style of functioning is to create disorder in society. Therefore, spreading lies and falsehoods come easily to them. They had pledged not to join politics, they floated a political outfit, they ruled out alliance with Congress but they are now allies. They claim to be anti-corruption but have been proven to be, despite being a young outfit, the most corrupt. They assured respect for women, look at the way they have behaved (Maliwal's assault). There is a huge gap between what they say and what they do. The liquor scam and assault on a woman MP have exposed them. Swati Maliwal's case has exposed Arvind Kejriwal personally, his true face is now there for people to see. This is their way of functioning that they first commit sin (paap) and then make wild allegations to divert attention. They believe in anarchy. They have no ideology... their only ideology is to grab power and hold it at all costs. When they are caught red-handed, then their conduct gets more outrageous. Maliwal is Kejriwal's party MP, the incident happened in his house, and they released the video, his party MP made the allegations and lodged an FIR and they have to call her a BJP agent. AAP leaders are propagandists, who believe in Goebbels' principles.Ram temple is an issue of faith for us and not a political issue, we have maintained it for years and still feel so. If you remember, the alliance of the two caste-based parties (SP and BSP) in 2019 was said to be formidable and it was believed BJP won't repeat its success of 2014. However, political pundits were proven wrong and BJP won 62 seats and the alliance's tally was 62. Again, there has been an attempt to set the poll narrative on caste and communal lines. However, the groundswell is so different from the reports you are talking about. There is a one-way wave in favour of BJP and people have made up their minds to make BJP the winner againThere'll not be much of a difference in the two states. BJP will achieve 90% of its targets.There is no denying that an attempt in Rajasthan was made to divide voters on caste lines and I can say that the opposition succeeded in a few seats. I agree that there are tough contests in a few seats but I don't see significant damage happening there.We focus on three important factors. First, BJP is an ideology-based party, second we are cadre-based and third we have a mass following. We don't accept all but we follow a long process of due diligence and assess them on the three parameters. We assess what strength is added, our old cadres are not disturbed and our ideology is not compromised. Our party is a big family, and we ensure a balance to safeguard the interests of the party cadre and accommodating a newcomer. You haven't heard of any protest against anyone joining the party. We manage it. We also take cadres into confidence. There might be reservations in a few quarters but our internal democracy and structure are so inclusive that anyone joining the party feels the comfort.West Bengal is for sure, look at the way Mamata Banerjee is behaving. She is set to be wiped out. I won't be surprised if BJP wins 18 seats in Odisha. We are headed for double-digit figures in Telangana and doing well in Andhra Pradesh with our allies. North-east and north India will be intact.Not at all. RSS is a social organisation and not a political outfit. You can't expect it to work like a political organisation, it won't be acceptable for its leadership also. But we have a common ideological bond and we work for the same ideological goals. We have always received RSS support in our endeavours and they have been helpful this time too.","J P Nadda tells TOI’s Akhilesh Singh his party is set to retain office with a thumping majority.

Opposition wants to turn majority into 2nd-class citizens: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-wants-to-turn-majority-into-2nd-class-citizens-pm-modi/articleshow/110445191.cms,"PM rakes up ‘Congress

’s pre-2014 plan’ to ‘create’ minority institutions overnight

LUCKNOW: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said INDIA bloc parties want to turn the country's majority community into second-class citizens and also accused them of planning to rewrite the Constitution to provide reservation on the basis of religion Sharpening the debate over Muslim quota and who wanted to change the Constitution, the PM attacked both SP and Congress at his rallies in Mirzapur and Ghosi, accusing them of promising religion-based reservation in the past. Addressing a public meeting in Mirzapur, Modi said: ""Here, first-time voters won't remember the SP's 2012 manifesto. SP clearly stated in their manifesto that just as Babasaheb gave reservation to Dalits, the same reservation will be given to Muslims. This goes against the spirit of the Constitution and Babasaheb's ideals.""""Even in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the SP in its manifesto announced to give reservation to Muslims. The SP had also announced that even in police and PAC (Provincial Armed Constabulary) 15 percent reservation will be given to Muslims,"" The PM said.Modi also raked up Congress’s “pre-2014 plan to declare schools, colleges, and universities as minority institutions”.“For this, Congress swiftly changed laws overnight and declared thousands of educational institutions as minority institutions. Previously, these institutions provided reservations to SCs, STs, OBCs, but that was completely abolished and reservations were now given to Muslims,” he said.A few days ago, the PM had on social media a video of Congress MP Rahul Gandhi campaigning in UP “10-12 years ago”, where he is purportedly heard accusing the late SP patriarch Mulayam Singh of going back on a promise to provide reservation to Muslims.In Ghosi, where he addressed another large gathering, Modi said, “Today, I have come to alert the people of Purvanchal and Ghosi about the big conspiracy of INDIA bloc.”Citing the opposition alliance’s three “big conspiracies”, he said, “First, they will change the Constitution so that reservation can be given based on religion. Second, they will end reservations for SCs, STs and OBCs. Third, they will distribute the entire reservation basket among Muslims.”Modi said a new conspiracy was being hatched to achieve their objective. “They are declaring Muslim castes as OBCs overnight. Recently, Calcutta high court rejected OBC reservations for 77 classes in West Bengal. The vote-hungry Congress and SP want to change Ambedkar’s Constitution so that their nefarious designs can’t be challenged in court.”Attacking SP & Congress again for turning down the invitation to attend the Ram temple’s consecration, the PM said their senior functionaries tried to even find fault in the construction of the shrine when nothing else worked.He said this was the same opposition that conspired to overturn the Supreme Court verdict on Ram Janmabhoomi, just like the Shah Bano case. “When I expose them, they start raising slogans about digging my grave.”He cautioned voters that INDIA bloc wanted castes like Rajbhar, Kushwaha, Gond, Kurmi, Brahmin, Rajput, Kayashtha, and Sindhi to fight among themselves and eventually get weaker. “Caste divides will benefit the alliance, which wants to divert people’s attention from actual issues.”","PM Narendra Modi said INDIA bloc parties want to turn the country's majority community into second-class citizens.

Odisha BJP candidate arrested for EVM vandalism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/odisha-bjp-candidate-arrested-for-evm-vandalism/articleshow/110445012.cms,"BHUBANESWAR: Prasanta Jagadev , the 55-year-old BJP candidate from Khurda assembly constituency , was arrested on Sunday for allegedly vandalising an EVM and assaulting polling personnel in a booth during the third phase of voting in Odisha on Saturday.The two-time BJD MLA , who was earlier booked in 11 criminal cases and is known for unruly conduct, had joined the BJP on February 29, two years after the regional party had expelled him for allegedly ramming his vehicle into some BJP workers in Khurda district on March 12, 2022, leaving several injured. He was arrested 10 days later.On Saturday afternoon, Jagadev, who was waiting to cast his vote at booth number 114 in Bolagarh block under Begunia assembly constituency, allegedly lost his cool and hurled abuses at the polling staff for supposed delay in the voting process, police sources said.Police said he allegedly ransacked the booth, leading to the damage of an EVM and caused disruptions in the polling process for several minutes. Police sources said Jagadev, who left the booth after the incident, was intercepted by the police while he was travelling in a vehicle, accompanied by a prominent BJP leader, on Saturday. He was brought to Bolagarh police station for questioning.“We arrested him on Sunday on the basis of a complaint lodged by one of the polling officials on duty. Relevant sections of the IPC and Representation of People’s Act have been imposed against him,” Khurda SP Awinash Kumar said. He was sent to Khurda jail following the rejection of his bail plea.BJD leader Bhrugu Baxipatra said Jagadev’s arrest exposed the BJP’s criteria of selecting candidates. “BJP fielded many candidates who were kicked out from the BJD for promoting criminal activities,” Baxipatra said.However, senior BJP politician Jiban Sahoo claimed Jagadev was falsely implicated in the case. “Jagadev was not involved in vandalising the EVM. We will lodge a protest,” Sahoo said.Jagadev, who was elected to the assembly on a BJD ticket from Begunia assembly segment in 2014 and from Chilika in 2019, is the second candidate to have been arrested this poll season. On May 14, Siva Shankar Dash, an Independent candidate from Berhampur assembly segment, was arrested by Gosani Nuagaon police for allegedly assaulting BJP’s Berhampur MP candidate Pradeep Panigrahy after the end of voting on May 13.In a separate incident, a case has been registered against BJD’s Chhendipada MLA candidate Susanta Kumar Behera in Angul district for allegedly attacking a BJP worker near a booth on Saturday. The office of the state chief electoral officer (CEO) has sought a report from the Angul district election officer on the matter.","Prasanta Jagadev, 55, was arrested on Sunday for allegedly vandalising an EVM and assaulting polling personnel in a booth during the third phase of voting in Odisha.

""Pakistan is a country which has consciously and continuously practised the use of terror as an instrument of state policy ,"" said Puri while speaking to reporters here.""Ever since Modi ji came (to power), those who were into cross-border terrorism have got a message,"" he said.Puri also held the Congress responsible for the anti-Sikh riots in 1984.It was not a riot, it was a massacre, he said.Puri said the Congress is yet to seek a ""proper apology"" for the 'Operation Bluestar'.Operation Bluestar was a military operation carried out in 1984 to flush out militants from the Golden Temple .Puri said that in 2014 when Modi took over, the country's economic position stood at 11 spot. ""It has now reached the fifth position"".The Union minister said at present, the country's GDP is USD 3.95 trillion and would soon surpass that of Japan which is at the fourth spot.The country's capital expenditure is growing by 30 per cent every year, he said.In the interim budget, the capital expenditure was earmarked at Rs 11 lakh crore, he said.When the Congress was in power from 2004 to 2014, the urban spending was Rs 1.70 lakh crore, he said, adding that During the last 10 years of the Modi government, this expenditure has risen to Rs 18-19 lakh crore.On BJP candidate from Chandigarh Lok Sabha seat Sanjay Tandon, Puri said Chandigarh is among the top cities of not only India but also of the world and it must be represented in the Parliament by a person of the calibre of Tandon who was familiar with the city's ethos and its problems.Tandon is pitted against Congress' Manish Tewari.Puri drew a distinction between BJP's manifestos and those of other parties.He said the difference between BJP manifesto and those of other parties is that ""we delivered what we promised in 2014, 2019, and will continue to fulfil in 2024 too"", while it's not the same case for other parties.He said the Congress is trying to come to power on a ""false narrative"" by making unviable promises.AAP, an INDIA bloc member, which is also supporting the Congress' Chandigarh nominee, is busy offering 'revaris' (freebies) to the public in order to come to power, he said.Emphasizing the importance of the ""double engine"" government, Puri exhorted people of Chandigarh to vote wisely.He said as there is a BJP government coming again at the Centre, electing a BJP candidate promises to accelerate the city's growth through the synergy of a ""double engine"" government.","Hardeep Singh Puri accuses Pakistan of using terrorism against India as an ""instrument of state policy"" He says under the Modi government, India has sent a clear message to the neighbouring country that it will eliminate terrorists in its territory.

These people should talk about work, should talk about issues like unemployment, inflation and poverty. They should talk about how investment can come to Bihar, how factories can be opened up, and how migration can be stopped. The public wants freedom from their lies and illusions.""The RJD leader also criticised PM Modi for making statements regarding sending him to jail. He said, ""The Prime Minister, fearing defeat, is now announcing the date of sending me to jail in election rallies. He is talking about sending that youth to jail who talks about providing employment. This is a public confession by the Prime Minister that he considers the investigation agencies his toys. He means to say that ED and CBI are his puppets.""Yadav added further, ""He (PM Modi) can send any opposition leader to jail in a fabricated and imaginary case whenever he wants, wherever he wants and however he wants.""Tejashwi Yadav also claimed that Narendra Modi wants to destroy the Constitution. ""Does the Prime Minister want to destroy the Constitution and democracy so that anyone who does not obey him, who opposes his lies, who exposes his failures will be sent straight to jail?

Now it is not expected from you that you will keep the discussion high while keeping in mind the dignity of your post. But today you have come to the terminology of ""Mujra"" and ""Mangalsutra"". Frankly speaking, we are worried about you. Should the language of the Prime Minister of this big-hearted country be like this?

PUNE: A prominent builder and father of the 17-year-old boy involved in Sunday's fatal Porsche Taycan crash was detained Tuesday along with his driver and an associate in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, 240km from Pune. The builder faces charges for allowing his underage son, who lacks a valid driving licence and proper training and consumed alcohol, to drive the car.Police also arrested Naman Bhutada and Sachin Kaatkar, owner and staffer of a Pune pub, and Sandip Sangle, an assistant manager at another pub. They were charged with serving liquor to minors without verifying their age. They were remanded in custody till May 24.Pune cops are transporting the builder and the two others to the city, and he is expected to be formally arrested and presented in court Wednesday. ""We will question the other two people and will take a call on whether to make them co-accused,"" Pune police commissioner A Kumar said.Aneesh Awadhia and Ashwini Koshta, both 24 years old and from Jabalpur in MP, were killed in the accident near a pub in an upscale Pune neighbourhood when the Porsche electric luxury sedan struck their bike from behind at 160kmph around 2.30am, dragging Koshta for 50ft, according to police.The underage driver was detained and Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) released him later with conditions such as writing a 300- word essay and assisting RTO officers for 15 days. Police have filed a review application against JJB’s bail order, while seeking to try the teenager as an adult. The matter will continue Wednesday.A case was also registered against the two pubs — the teenager and his friends visited — for serving liquor to minors. “On Tuesday evening, we also detained a manager and a staffer of Blak Marriott for questioning and will take a call on their arrest soon,” DCP (crime) Amol Zende said. The police are searching for two more suspects.“The builder attempted to outsmart us after fleeing from the city. He sent one of his vehicles towards Mumbai and another to Goa. He borrowed a vehicle from an associate but this vehicle had an inbuilt GPS device. Examining CCTV footage from the builder’s bungalow, we found that he had left in a car towards Ahmednagar road. Based on the vehicle’s registration number, we secured the GPS coordinates and tracked the vehicle to Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar,” police chief Kumar said.Police found the builder’s driver and an associate in a hotel and their questioning led them to a lodge near Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar railway station where the builder was allegedly hiding.","Aneesh Awadhia and Ashwini Koshta, both 24 years old and from Jabalpur in MP, were killed in the accident near a pub in an upscale Pune neighbourhood.

Hit by heat? Delhi turnout drops to 10-year low,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hit-by-heat-delhi-turnout-drops-to-10-year-low/articleshow/110427766.cms?pcode=462,"Voting loses steam as temp rises

NEW DELHI: Intense heat, extended weekend, and general indifference seem to have caused a drop of close to 4.5 percentage points in voter turnout in the capital for the parliamentary elections on Saturday. The city was electing seven members of the Lok Sabha after intense campaigning by BJP, AAP, and Congress, the latter two having struck an alliance.According to Election Commission's voter turnout app at 10pm, 56 per cent of over 1.5 crore eligible voters cast their votes in the capital. In 2019, the turnout had been recorded at 60.6 per cent and in 2014, it was 65.1 per cent, indicating a sharp drop in voter engagement despite strenuous efforts by EC, civil society groups and RWAs to encourage people to exercise their franchise.EC officials, however, added that the turnout figures were still undergoing revision and the final number would emerge later.Though 162 candidates are in the fray, the fight is largely between BJP, which is looking at a hat-trick with a clean sweep, and the AAP-Congress combine, which fought its first election together after making a pre-poll seat-sharing arrangement.North East Delhi parliamentary constituency, which has witnessed an interesting electoral battle between BJP's sitting MP Manoj Tiwari and Congress' Kanhaiya Kumar, recorded the highest voting percentage of approximately 60.8 per cent in the capital. The lowest voter turnout of 52 per cent was recorded in New Delhi constituency, which is home to politicians, bureaucrats and judges and has a number of upscale residential pockets. It also houses many govt employees. Here, BJP's Bansuri Swaraj is contesting against AAP's Somnath Bharti.At 10pm, the voter turnout in West Delhi was recorded at 57.8 per cent ; in Chandni Chowk 58.1 per cent ; in East Delhi 54.8 per cent ; in South Delhi 53.9 per cent ; and in North West Delhi 53.8 per cent .A senior official at the office of chief electoral officer of Delhi said voting was continuing in a few polling booths in North East Delhi and North West Delhi till 7.30pm, much beyond the cut-off time of 6pm.""We should wait till the time the final voter turnout is known to make an analysis,"" said an official from the office of the chief electoral officer of Delhi. ""Getting the data from some polling stations takes time and this does not include postal ballots,"" the official added.Polling had started at a brisk speed in the morning with the sun yet to glare down at the capital. There were queues at several polling booths across the city. But as the day progressed to noon and then late afternoon, the crowds dwindled. Queues began to form again in the evening before the closing time of 6pm.While there were some reports of EVM and VVPAT machines developing snags in some booths, officials claimed these were minor hiccups. CPI (M) functionary Brinda Karat, however, alleged she had to wait for almost an hour to cast her vote as the battery of the EVM control unit at her polling booth at St Columba's School in the New Delhi constituency ""drained out"". Poll officials, however, said it was replaced.Delhi ministers Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj also complained about alleged irregularities. Atishi allegedthat irregularities were committed by presiding officers in Janakpuri and Kalkaji.Both BJP and AAP-Congress alliance have a lot at stake in this election. While BJP is looking at asserting its political dominance by winning all seven Delhi seats, as it has done in the two Lok Sabha elections in the immediate past, Congress, with the help of AAP, is trying to reclaim a foothold in the city politics. AAP is looking to have a larger say in national politics by sending its functionaries to Lok Sabha.Under the seat-sharing arrangement, AAP has fielded candidates on four seats – New Delhi, South Delhi, West Delhi and East Delhi – while Congress is contesting three – North East Delhi, Chandni Chowk and North West Delhi.","According to Election Commission's voter turnout app at 10pm, 56 per cent of over 1.5 crore eligible voters cast their votes in the capital. In 2019, the turnout had been recorded at 60.6 per cent and in 2014, it was 65.1 per cent, indicating a sharp drop in voter engagement.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110427789,imgsize-1618144,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110427789.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Coming down heavily on a Pakistani lawmaker for his comments on Lok Sabha elections , Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday responded strongly and said that India was fully capable of solving its own problems and that the Pakistani leader's tweet of support was not needed.The former Pakistan minister Chaudhry Fawad Hussain shared Arvind Kejriwal's post on X on voting with his family, and said, “May peace and harmony defeat forces of hate and extremism”, with the hashtags ""MorePower"" and ""IndiaElection2024"".Minutes after Hussain's post, Kejriwal hit back at him, saying his post was unnecessary.“Chaudhary Sahib, I and the people of my country are fully capable of handling our issues. Your tweet is not needed. The situation in Pakistan is very bad right now. You take care of your country,” Kejriwal said on X.In another post, the chief minister said the elections are India's internal matter and the country will ""not tolerate interference by the biggest sponsors of terrorism"".Responding to Kejriwal's posts, Hussain said, ""CM sb! Indeed electioneering is your own issue but hope you will appreciate extremism be it in Pakistan or India is a borderless phenomenon and dangerous for everyone be it BD (Bangladesh), India or Pak so everyone with some conscience must be concerned... (sic).""""The situation in Pakistan is very far from ideal but individuals must strive for a better society wherever they are,"" he said.Earlier in the day, posting a picture of his family after exercising his franchise, the Delhi chief minister wrote, “I voted today with my father, wife and children. My mother is very ill. She could not go. I voted against dictatorship, unemployment and inflation. You too must go and vote.”Hitting out at Kejriwal, the BJP alleged that Pakistan has also jumped in support of the AAP leader's politics of corruption.Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said his party has been saying that ""Kejriwal is hand in glove with the country's enemies"".""Chaudhry Fawad Hussain is speaking now. He had also written a social media post on Kejriwal's release. Five phases of elections have already been conducted but no remarks were made, when polls are now being held in Delhi, the statement from Pakistan has come. This shows Kejriwal has the backing of Pakistan,"" Sachdeva told reporters.Notably, this is not the first time the Pakistani minister Fawad Chaudhry has come out in support of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Chaudhry had also supported Kejriwal after he received bail in the money laundering case linked to alleged liquor excise policy.On May 1, Chaudhry - infamous for boasting about Pakistan's hand in the 2019 Pulwama terror attack - had posted on X excerpts from a speech by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi with the caption ""Rahul on fire"". This drew sharp criticism from BJP leaders.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also slammed Gandhi and the Congress, saying Pakistan is desperate to make Gandhi the next prime minister.Eight states and Union territories are voting today in the penultimate phase of the Lok Sabha polls. By the end of this phase, a total of 486 of the 543 Lok Sabha seats will have completed polling, with just 57 seats left for the seventh phase","Former Pakistan minister Chaudhry Fawad Hussain shared Arvind Kejriwal's post on X on voting with his family.

"Rishi Sunak sees 78 Tory MPs exit ahead of July poll, surpassing 1997 exodus before Tony Blair's win",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/rishi-sunak-sees-78-tory-mps-exit-ahead-of-july-poll-surpassing-1997-exodus-before-tony-blairs-win/articleshow/110445174.cms,"Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak (AFP photo)

There were tears, anger and frustration as many Conservative lawmakers digested their PM Rishi Sunak 's decision to call the UK elections on July 4, much earlier than they had ever expected.

Some of those fighting to retain their seats feared the six weeks left to convince skeptical voters to back them would not be enough. For others planning to stand down, it meant an abrupt end to their political careers , forced to clear out their offices months earlier than planned.Trailing Labour by over 20 percentage points in polls, Sunak, analysts said, is betting that the Tories can cut their losses by facing the voters.

But a grassroots Conservative campaign coordinator said that the morale was the lowest he had known in five decades. Tory members of parliament seem to share this sense of futility: 78 of them have opted not to contest their seats, an exodus that includes Michael Gove, who once vied for party's top post and has been at the heart of nearly every Conservative-led govt since David Cameron's in 2010. Other high profile figures who have announced they will not seek re-election include former PM Theresa May, Northern Ireland minister Chris Heaton- Harris, ex-armed forces minister James Heappey and ex-defence minister Ben Wallace.

The number of Tories exiting is more than the previous post-1945 high of 72 who quit prior to Tony Blair's 1997 landslide win for Labour, which is expected to triumph again. The departures add to a feeling that the Conservatives are on track to be kicked out of power after 14 years, although Labour require a big swing to secure a majority. Sunak's decision to go to the polls early has triggered fears that he's leading the party to one or more ""Portillo"" moments - when a Tory big beast loses a safe seat in an election whitewash - named for the time cabinet minister Michael Portillo lost in Enfield Southgate in 1997.

NEW DELHI: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has taken the 'unusual step' of spending a day away from public events on the first Saturday of the election campaign to strategise with his closest advisers and family, ahead of the upcoming polls on July 4, PTI reported.This comes amidst a significant number of senior Conservative Party members, including Cabinet ministers Michael Gove and Andrea Leadsom, announcing their decision not to stand for re-election in the upcoming polls.In his letter, Gove acknowledged the challenges of political office and expressed his belief that it was time for a new generation to lead. ""After careful reflection, I have decided not to stand as a candidate in the forthcoming election,"" wrote Leadsom in released a letter to Sunak.Despite claims that Sunak was hoping to reset his campaign, sources clarified that he was spending the day campaigning in his north England constituency of Yorkshire. Conservative minister Bim Afolami dismissed criticisms of the Sunak campaign made by the Opposition, emphasizing the importance of framing the election correctly.Theresa May, who previously served as the prime minister, is one of the prominent members of parliament deciding to step down from their positions. This announcement comes after Ben Wallace, the former defence minister, had already made public his intention to withdraw from frontline politics.During a visit to the Titanic Quarter in Belfast on Friday, Sunak faced a reporter's question about whether he was ""captaining a sinking ship"" heading into the election. Meanwhile, Opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer is focusing on public events to argue that the Conservatives have damaged the economy and increased living costs.A recent YouGov opinion poll conducted after Sunak called the snap summer general election showed Labour's lead falling by three points, with the Conservatives up by one point to 22 percent and Labour down two to 44 percent.","British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has taken the 'unusual step' of spending a day away from public events on the first Saturday of the election campaign.
