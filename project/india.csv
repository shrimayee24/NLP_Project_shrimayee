""Congress Only Party To Respect Him..."" Pappu Yadav Alleges BJP Sidelining Nitish Kumar in NDA

Poll Do you believe Nitish Kumar's return to NDA is a positive move for Bihar? Yes, it's a great decision No, it's not beneficial

NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), saying he had joined the party “because of circumstances.” Reaffirming his commitment to the NDA , he said he is “back in NDA for good.” He also criticised the RJD’s rule before his 20-year tenure as chief minister, saying, “pehle bahut bura haal tha,” and highlighted the shortcomings of the Lalu-Rabri governments, taking aim at their administration.Addressing his first election rally in Minapur, Muzaffarpur, Kumar took a dig at his rival Lalu Prasad and said, “Because of circumstances, I had to tie up with those people, but it did not take me long to realise that they were good for nothing. Now I am back (in NDA) for good.”Kumar recalled that his earlier alliances with the RJD in 2015 and 2022 both lasted less than two years. On both occasions, Lalu’s son Tejashwi Yadav, now leader of the opposition in Vidhan Sabha, served as his deputy chief minister.He highlighted his government’s focus on improving infrastructure, education, and healthcare in Bihar, and praised the Narendra Modi government at the Centre for its support.Talking about law and order, Kumar said, “An atmosphere of terror had prevailed in Bihar because of poor law and order and alleged patronage to criminals by the powers that be, until I took over. But now, it is for all to see how much things have changed.”He added that communal harmony has also improved. “Even disputes between Hindus and Muslims have come down because we were sensitive to needs like fencing of religious places of both faiths,” he said.Taking a swipe at Lalu Prasad, Kumar accused him of ignoring women’s welfare during his tenure. “Did the ones in power do anything for women? They could not have cared less. Only when, after seven years of chief ministership, a situation came where stepping down could not have been avoided, the wife was installed,” he said, referring to Rabri Devi’s appointment as chief minister in 1997.Kumar contrasted this with his own government’s focus on women’s empowerment, citing the success of self-help groups and the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, under which Rs 10,000 each has been transferred to over one crore women beneficiaries.Seeking a record fifth consecutive term, Nitish Kumar said he was disillusioned with the RJD after two short-lived alliances and has now decided to stay with the NDA for good.","Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal.

Police warn against 'misinformation'

West Bengal Police post

NEW DELHI: The alleged desecration of a Goddess Kali idol triggered outrage in West Bengal's South 24 Parganas district on Wednesday, with the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accusing the Trinamool Congress (TMC)-led state government of ""shielding"" the culprits.The incident occurred at a village under the Suryanagar gram panchayat area in the Kakdwip assembly constituency, where locals reportedly found the damaged idol inside a temple, news agency PTI reported.The idol was later taken awayin a prison van, further escalating tensions and fuelling political slugfest over the incident. BJP leaders shared videos of the idol being removed and accused chief minister Mamata Banerjee of “insulting” Hindu sentiments — a charge the party has repeatedly levelled against the Trinamool supremo.Rejecting the allegation, a TMC leader accused the BJP of trying to ""vitiate the atmosphere.""""The BJP is trying to communalise the incident and vitiate the atmosphere. Let police complete the probe. We condemn any attempt to disturb the harmony in this area,"" the leader, a local party functionary, stated.Meanwhile, the West Bengal Police issued a statement, saying that ""misinformation"" was being spread about the incident.“Efforts are being made from certain quarters to spread misinformation about an incident in Kakdwip. Facts are: an idol of Goddess Kali in a village temple under Suryanagar GP was found to be damaged this morning. Efforts are on to identify the person/persons behind the mischief. Stern action will be taken against those responsible for the incident,"" it posted on X.The police added that locals had blocked the national highway in protest and refused to go ahead with the immersion.“Police persuaded the agitators for hours to withdraw the blockade, which was causing serious public inconvenience, with ambulances carrying patients also being stuck. When the agitators did not relent and started pelting stones at the police, minimum force was resorted to by the police to disperse the mob. The immersion of the idol was facilitated thereafter,” it said.The incident comes ahead of next year’s West Bengal assembly elections, where Mamata Banerjee will seek a fourth consecutive term as chief minister.","The alleged desecration of a Goddess Kali idol triggered outrage in West Bengal's South 24 Parganas district.

Poll Do you believe the cancellation of Shweta Suman's nomination was politically motivated? Yes, definitely No, it's a procedural issue

In a major setback for the opposition INDIA bloc in Bihar, the nomination of RJD candidate Shweta Suman from the Mohania assembly constituency was cancelled on Wednesday.The reason for the cancellation is not yet known. However, Suman alleged that the returning officer (RO) and other officials were under ""pressure"" from Delhi. ""Pressure was constantly being placed on the RO and CO from Delhi. They were forced to make this decision. They said they were helpless... The BJP, PM Modi, and Amit Shah were the ones putting pressure. Who else would be putting the pressure? ... I will definitely go to court... Sangeeta, the BJP candidate from here, submitted her caste certificate after the notification date. But since she is from the BJP, nothing will be done,"" Suman told reporters.The RJD leader also broke down while speaking to the media.Earlier on Tuesday, in East Champaran, the INDIA bloc faced another setback when the nomination of Shashi Bhushan Singh, the VIP candidate from the Sugauli Assembly constituency, was rejected by returning officer and SDM Motihari Sweta Bharati.The 243-member Bihar Assembly will vote in two phases on November 6 and 11, and the results will be declared on November 14.","Nomination of RJD candidate Shweta Suman from the Mohania assembly constituency was cancelled on Wednesday.

All confusion over CM face will end today, says Gehlot



PATNA: RJD scion Tejashwi Yadav ’s long wait to be officially declared INDIA bloc’s CM face in Bihar looked set to end after Congress ’s designated troubleshooter, Ashok Gehlot, and the party’s state in-charge Krishna Allavaru met him and his father Lalu Prasad in Patna Wednesday to break a stalemate that has dragged into the business end of elections.Congress kept mum on the outcome of the meeting, but ally CPI(ML)’s general secretary, Dipankar Bhattacharya, suggested patience was running out within the alliance over the delay in declaring what he said was a no-brainer.“Tejashwi’s name as the opposition’s CM candidate could be officially announced at INDIA bloc’s joint press conference on Thursday. Entire Bihar knows Tejashwi will be the CM if INDIA bloc gets majority,” Bhattacharya said.“Our meeting with Lalu was highly positive. INDIA bloc is united and contesting the elections as a strong force. The full situation will be clarified at the presser,” Gehlot said, emerging from the meeting, along with Tejashwi.Ashok Gehlot, however, declined to go beyond proclaiming that “all confusion” would end at Thursday’s press conference.Congress has so far been cagey about naming Tejashwi as INDIA bloc’s unanimous pick, refusing to reciprocate the latter’s move of publicly acknowledging Lok Sabha LoP Rahul Gandhi as the alliance’s prime ministerial face for the next general elections.“Tejashwi becoming CM is as straight a choice as Nitish Kumar not becoming the CM again,” Bhattacharya said.On INDIA bloc allies contesting against each other in some places because of the seat-sharing dispute, Gehlot rejected the idea that “friendly fights” within INDIA bloc were an issue. “Such things are normal. Bihar wants a change, and people understand that our victory is in interest of the country,” he said.Allavaru, blamed for the mess, said Congress was “serious” about the assembly polls.Earlier in the day, Tejashwi downplayed talk of alliance being fragmented. “There is no controversy or confusion in INDIA bloc...Will talk tomorrow. You will get an answer to every question,” he said.The INDIA bloc brass was last seen together at the launch of ‘Ati Pichhda EBC Sankalp Patra’ in Patna on Sept 24. On that occasion, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul, Tejashwi and Vikassheel Insaan Party chief Mukesh Sahani were present.Prior to that, the group travelled together during Rahul’s fortnight-long Voter Adhikar Yatra that passed through 25-odd districts.",Congress has so far been cagey about naming Tejashwi as INDIA bloc’s unanimous pick.

Bihar Assembly polls: Lack of unanimity on CM face may increase rift in opposition camp,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-assembly-polls-lack-of-unanimity-on-cm-face-may-increase-rift-in-opposition-camp/articleshow/124748308.cms,"Tejashwi Slams Double-Engine Govt on Corruption,Assures No Seat-Sharing Disputes in Mahagathbandhan

NEW DELHI: As speculation builds on whether or not the ‘mahagathbandhan’ formally names Rashtriya Janata Dal neta Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial candidate, a strong view within the governing NDA is that it is on a firm footing to tackle the issue that has sharpened divisions in the opposition camp.In case of declaration of the RJD’s de facto leader as the CM choice of the alliance, which includes Congress , the Left and Vikassheel Insaan Party, its core support base, especially Yadavs, is bound to enthusiastically rally around his leadership.Several NDA functionaries are of the view that it will also allow them to ramp up their pitch of ‘jungle raaj’, a charge they have long levelled against the 15-year combined governance of his father Lalu Prasad Yadav and mother Rabri Devi between 1990 and 2005, with considerable electoral gains at successive hustings.As the charge of dominance by Yadavs, the most populous caste at over 14.2%, stuck, a large section of non-Yadav other backward classes and extremely backward classes besides Scheduled Castes steadily drifted away from RJD, leading to its string of electoral defeats.Chief minister Nitish Kumar successfully tapped into the resentment of these castes and emerged as the champion of their interests, and, in alliance with BJP, is hoping to repeat the success of weaving a winning social coalition.A lack of unanimity in the opposition alliance on Tejashwi as its leader in the polls, which has been the case so far, will accentuate differences among allies, who have so far failed to kick-start their campaign after being unable to arrive at a consensus over a seat-sharing arrangement.Congress has rushed its seasoned neta Ashok Gehlot to Patna to hold meetings with RJD top brass and other allies to sort out their differences.Tejashwi said Wednesday that alliance netas will hold a press conference Thursday, as he insisted there were no differences among them.The biggest question remains whether Congress comes around and agrees to his projection as the alliance’s CM pick. Congress has so far been lukewarm to the idea, even though he is being seen as an obvious choice in case of its poll victory.RJD is of the view that Tejashwi’s tenure as deputy CM has earned him goodwill, and his youthful candidature against Nitish’s “tired” persona will boost the alliance’s prospects. The framing of charges against Tejashwi and his parents by a court in a corruption case pertaining to the tenure of Lalu as railway minister will also come in handy for the NDA in case of his elevation.",Speculation builds on whether the ‘mahagathbandhan’ formally names Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial candidate.
