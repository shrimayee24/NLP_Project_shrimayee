NEW DELHI: Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju defended the deployment of CISF personnel in the Rajya Sabha's Well, citing instances where MPs had physically climbed atop the treasury bench and assured Congress that no MP would be stopped from speaking.Earlier, Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge expressed concerns on Friday over CISF personnel deployment.

No MPs will be stopped from speaking.""He clarified that CISF personnel would remain passive unless MPs engaged in disruptive behaviour, ANI reported.The Union Minister stated, ""Marshals and security inside the House will not take any action till the time MPs indulge in something malicious.

"Have 'atom bomb' to prove EC is helping BJP steal votes, says Rahul",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/have-atom-bomb-to-prove-ec-is-helping-bjp-steal-votes-says-rahul/articleshow/123051969.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Congress functionary Rahul Gandhi Friday said his party has collected ""atom bomb"" of evidence to prove that EC is helping BJP steal votes, stepping up his attack on ""vote chori"" on a day he led the joint opposition in writing to Lok Sabha Speaker demanding an immediate discussion on the review of electoral rolls in Bihar. The opposition told Speaker that the issue has a direct bearing on the ""right to vote"" and ""conduct of free and fair elections"", and merits an urgent debate.Talking about Congress' probe, likely about voters' list for Bangalore Rural LS seat, Rahul told reporters, ""What we found is atom bomb; I mean EC will be blown away when that atom bomb explodes"". The opposition's letter to Om Birla - signed by Congress, DMK, NCP-SP, RSP, SS-UBT, SP, TMC and RJD - expressed serious concern over the Bihar poll roll revision being done just before elections. It said EC has also announced the exercise will be done nationally, despite apprehensions about ""transparency, timing and intent of process"".The letter said the opposition had on several occasions listed a discussion on SIR as a priority, but the Modi govt has not notified a date yet.As he doubled down on his allegations, Rahul warned that officials involved in the ""theft"" will not be spared. ""...because you are working against India, which is treason.Remember, wherever you are, whether retired or whatever, we will find you,"" he said. Rahul argued that Congress had suspicions after assembly polls in MP, which solidified after LS polls, and were further deepened with Maharashtra contest last year. Since EC was not helping with voters' lists, the party conducted its own deep dive into voters data.Meanwhile, BJP Friday took a swipe at Rahul's ""atom bomb"" claim, asking him to ""flow like water"" instead of ""exploding like a bomb"". ""If they explode a bomb, we will save Constitution,"" said BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra. He said the Opposition speaks of such things because they have no faith in democracy.","Congress functionary Rahul Gandhi Friday said his party has collected ""atom bomb"" of evidence to prove that EC is helping BJP steal votes.

NEW DELHI: Telangana chief minister A Revanth Reddy found himself at the centre of a political and media storm on Friday after remarks he made about young journalists drew sharp criticism from press bodies and social media users alike.The comments came during the 10th anniversary celebration of Telugu daily Nava Telangana, where he contrasted senior journalists' dedication with what he described as the arrogance and lack of etiquette among younger reporters.""To analyse, they (journalists) keep their health and families at stake. To understand the problems of people, they go to remote areas for days and stay in public to publish their findings,"" Reddy said, praising senior journalists. He then criticised younger journalists, saying, ""Now, young journalists don’t even know about those senior journalists. They don’t even have the common sense to stand up when those senior journalists come. .. I sometimes feel like slapping them.

Press associations have demanded a clarification, though Reddy has not issued any formal response.At the same event, the CM also criticised political parties for launching media outlets to serve their interests.

NEW DELHI: More than a year after explicit videos allegedly featuring former MP Prajwal Revanna triggered a political storm ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, a special court in Bengaluru on Friday convicted him in one of the four rape cases registered against him.The special court for elected representatives, presided over by Judge Santosh Gajanan Bhat, found Revanna guilty in a case involving the rape of a domestic help at his family's Gannikada farmhouse in Holenarasipura, Hassan district.Revanna, who is the grandson of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda and a now-expelled JD(S) leader, broke down and was seen weeping in court after the verdict was announced, as per news agency ANI.Also read: Former PM Devegowda's grandson Prajwal Revanna convicted for raping domestic help The woman, then 48, alleged that she had been raped twice in 2021 and that the acts were recorded on his mobile phone.

The verdict, initially due on July 30, had been delayed as the court sought clarification on technical matters. It was finally delivered on August 1.Prajwal Revanna is the prime accused in four separate criminal cases, all involving allegations of rape, sexual harassment, and criminal intimidation.The cases came to light in April 2024 after pen drives containing obscene video clips, allegedly involving Revanna, were circulated in Hassan. The scandal erupted just before the Lok Sabha elections, dealing a blow to Revanna’s political career—he lost the Hassan seat by over 40,000 votes.The Karnataka government had formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the allegations, and that Revanna was arrested on May 31, 2024 at Bengaluru airport after returning from Germany, where he had stayed for 35 days.In November 2024, the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal against the Karnataka high court’s rejection of both regular and anticipatory bail. “Dismissed,” said Justice Bela M. Trivedi, while Justice Satish Chandra Sharma added that there were several complaints against him. “You are so powerful,” the bench remarked when senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Revanna, argued that Section 376 (rape) was not cited in the original complaint.Also Read: Who is Prajwal Revanna?
