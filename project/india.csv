'Only Mistake I Made Was...': Prajwal Revanna Tells Court Before Life Sentence In Rape Case

Poll Do you think protests will effectively change the political situation in Punjab? Yes No

PATIALA: AAP MLA Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra has allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.According to Punjab Police sources, Pathanmajra and his accomplices fired at police officers during the escape and even ran over one personnel, leaving him injured.According to reports, Pathanmajra and his accomplices ran over police personnel with an SUV.The Sanour MLA was arrested a day after publicly criticising his party’s Delhi leadership.His detention in Patiala was linked to a rape case filed against him, sparking political uproar in the region.In a social media post, Pathanmajra claimed the case related to his former wife and alleged that the fresh charges of rape were politically motivated.“I was booked because I raised my voice against my own government, especially the Delhi leadership,” he wrote.His brother, Hardev Singh, said the MLA was taken into custody under Section 376 of the IPC despite already having been granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. “He was arrested from Dabri in Haryana in a case where bail was already granted. This is clearly an attempt to silence him,” he alleged.CIA Patiala confirmed that three weapons have been recovered and one accomplice of MLA Pathanmajra has been arrested.The arrested individual has been identified as Balwinder Singh, while the search for MLA Pathanmajra continues.Police said two officers were injured when stones were thrown at them during the MLA’s escape attempt.Authorities added that supporters of the MLA not only pelted stones but also opened fire at the police team.Before his arrest, Pathanmajra had appealed to colleagues and supporters via Facebook to protest outside the Patiala SSP’s office at the Mini Secretariat. He urged people to reach “in tractors, trolleys, and cars” to demand his release. “I will not be silenced even if more cases are registered against me. Will AAP’s Delhi leadership rule Punjabis now? Even Congress and BJP did not interfere to this extent,” he said.The MLA has repeatedly accused the party’s central leadership of sidelining Punjab leaders and “remote-controlling” the state. Recently, he criticised officials of the Irrigation Department over flood relief efforts in his constituency. Soon after, his security cover was withdrawn and police officers in the area were reshuffled — moves that raised eyebrows.“This is retaliation. They looted Punjab more than Abdali. Now they want to sell Punjab,” Pathanmajra declared.","Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.

Modi govt not implementing quota for backward classes in pvt edu institutions: Congress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-govt-not-implementing-quota-for-backward-classes-in-pvt-edu-institutions-congress/articleshow/123721938.cms,"Modi govt not implementing quota for backward classes in pvt edu institutions: Congress

NEW DELHI: Calling it “unfortunate” that a prime minister who calls himself OBC has steered clear of social justice measures, Congress on Friday accused Narendra Modi of not implementing reservations in private educational institutions, including higher education, for 11 years since the Supreme Court gave its nod to the Constitutional Amendment of Article 15(5). The party demanded that the Modi govt bring a law to activate the constitutional provision in the coming Winter session of Parliament.Congress also slammed the non-revision of income ceiling for OBC “creamy layer” which is pending for five years.Heads of the party’s tribal, SC and OBC departments — Vikrant Bhuria, Rajendra Gautam and Anil Jaihind — said quotas in private educational bodies is the crying need of the hour, because private bodies dominate the education scene in the era of privatisation but with a small share of backward classes as students. They said the ‘parliamentary standing committee on education, women, children, youth and sports’ in its report on Aug 20 noted that private institutions of eminence have 0.89% SC students, 0.53% STs and 11.16% OBCs.In this context, the panel, with members from all the parties, including BJP and headed by Congress MP Digvijaya Singh, recommended that the Centre pass a law to implement Article 15(5) to provide 15% quota for SCs, 7.5% for STs and 27% for OBCs in private higher educational institutions.“Modi is sitting on this law for 11 years after the SC judgement upheld it. And, he calls himself an OBC,” Gautam said. Congress reminded that the Modi govt passed quotas for economically weaker sections within 48 hours but is not able to activate the law for the backward classes.Jaihind slammed the govt for not revising the income ceiling for OBC creamy layer for the last five years, saying it is hurting the prospects of backward caste candidates in education and employment. Jaihind said the income ceiling is revised every three years and was last hiked in 2017, referring to a major controversial issue that has been repeatedly taken up by the Mandal outfits.Congress demanded that the govt bring in a provision which would allow the unfilled quota seats of OBCs to be transferred to the “creamy layer” OBCs, just like the unfilled EWS seats are filled by the general castes.","Modi govt not implementing quota for backward classes in pvt edu institutions: Congress.

Poll Do you think social media plays a significant role in exposing political misconduct? Yes, it's crucial for accountability. No, it often spreads misinformation.





PUNE: The opposition on Thursday targeted deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar claiming that he had tried to stop IPS officer Anjana Krishna from Solapur rural police from taking action against an NCP member in an illegal sand mining case.They based their allegation on a video clip of a purported cellphone conversation between Ajit Pawar and her that surfaced on social media.The purported video was recorded in Kurdu village of Karmala tehsil in Solapur a few days ago. Krishna, who is posted as a sub-divisional police officer of Karmala with Solapur rural police, had gone to take action against illegal murum (sand) mining.According to the opposition, an NCP member involved in the illegal mining called Ajit Pawar from his cellphone and requested him to speak to Krishna. The video was recorded by someone in an open field, in which a voice allegedly of Ajit Pawar can be heard telling the IPS officer to stop the action.Madha MP from NCP (SP) Dhairyasheel Mohite Patil, under whose constituency Kurdu village falls, told TOI, ""After the video surfaced, I collected more information and found out that local villagers complained against the sand mining, after which the IPS officer with a district administration team went to the spot.A local NCP member at the spot called up Ajit Pawar and made the officer speak to him, after which the action halted. ""Mohite Patil added that the voice in the video told the police officer, ""I am giving directions to stop the action. You tell the tehsildar that the dy CM himself said so. The situation in Mumbai is bad, and we need to give it priority.""In the same video, the MP added, the person could be heard threatening action against the IPS officer when she told him to call her on her cellphone directly for authentication. ""Are you asking me to call you directly? I will take action against you. You want to see me, give me your number, I will call you on WhatsApp, I hope you will be able to recognise my face. You have the audacity? Give me your number, I will call you,"" Mohite Patil said quoting the clip.Social activist Vijay Kumbhar said, ""The IPS officer followed the law, but the deputy CM threatened her. Is this why politicians want their 'favourite' officers in key positions?"" Activist Anjali Damania said that deputy CM should apologise to the officer. TOI's calls to Krishna on Thursday went unanswered.",Opposition claims Ajit Pawar tried to stop IPS officer Anjana Krishna from taking action against an NCP member in an illegal sand mining case.
