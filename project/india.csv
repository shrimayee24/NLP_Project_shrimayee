""Congress Only Party To Respect Him..."" Pappu Yadav Alleges BJP Sidelining Nitish Kumar in NDA

Poll Do you believe Nitish Kumar's return to NDA is a positive move for Bihar? Yes, it's a great decision No, it's not beneficial

NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), saying he had joined the party “because of circumstances.” Reaffirming his commitment to the NDA , he said he is “back in NDA for good.” He also criticised the RJD’s rule before his 20-year tenure as chief minister, saying, “pehle bahut bura haal tha,” and highlighted the shortcomings of the Lalu-Rabri governments, taking aim at their administration.Addressing his first election rally in Minapur, Muzaffarpur, Kumar took a dig at his rival Lalu Prasad and said, “Because of circumstances, I had to tie up with those people, but it did not take me long to realise that they were good for nothing. Now I am back (in NDA) for good.”Kumar recalled that his earlier alliances with the RJD in 2015 and 2022 both lasted less than two years. On both occasions, Lalu’s son Tejashwi Yadav, now leader of the opposition in Vidhan Sabha, served as his deputy chief minister.He highlighted his government’s focus on improving infrastructure, education, and healthcare in Bihar, and praised the Narendra Modi government at the Centre for its support.Talking about law and order, Kumar said, “An atmosphere of terror had prevailed in Bihar because of poor law and order and alleged patronage to criminals by the powers that be, until I took over. But now, it is for all to see how much things have changed.”He added that communal harmony has also improved. “Even disputes between Hindus and Muslims have come down because we were sensitive to needs like fencing of religious places of both faiths,” he said.Taking a swipe at Lalu Prasad, Kumar accused him of ignoring women’s welfare during his tenure. “Did the ones in power do anything for women? They could not have cared less. Only when, after seven years of chief ministership, a situation came where stepping down could not have been avoided, the wife was installed,” he said, referring to Rabri Devi’s appointment as chief minister in 1997.Kumar contrasted this with his own government’s focus on women’s empowerment, citing the success of self-help groups and the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, under which Rs 10,000 each has been transferred to over one crore women beneficiaries.Seeking a record fifth consecutive term, Nitish Kumar said he was disillusioned with the RJD after two short-lived alliances and has now decided to stay with the NDA for good.","Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar reflected on his past alliances with the Rashtriya Janata Dal.

RS poll: NC denies ‘match fixing’ charge; Omar refuses to reveal names of MLAs who cross-voted for BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-poll-nc-denies-match-fixing-charge-omar-refuses-to-reveal-names-of-mlas-who-cross-voted-for-bjp/articleshow/124816552.cms,"Omar Abdullah

SRINAGAR: Political tempers are running high in Kashmir Valley after BJP won one of the four Rajya Sabha seats in J&K with support from four legislators outside the party on Friday. The National Conference (NC) leadership exonerated its legislators and allies of cross-voting charges, although party president Farooq Abdullah created a flutter by revealing that BJP had approached them before the polls.Chief minister Omar Abdullah said NC could not manage a clean sweep as it was betrayed, but he refused to disclose the names of those who cross-voted.“One shouldn’t have any complaints with a 3-1 score. We tried for a 4-nil victory, but we were ditched at the last moment by some people,” Omar said on Saturday.“Everyone knows the names of those who betrayed us and voted for BJP, I don’t want to repeat them. But, their act is regrettable,” Omar said, adding it was not appropriate to reveal the names.Giving a clean chit to his party members, the CM said, “I am satisfied that not a single NC vote went elsewhere. All NC legislators showed their polling slips to their party agent.”Omar thanked Congress and “some other colleagues” for their support, but did not name Membooba Mufti-led PDP, thus keep it in the circle of doubt. He also accused People’s Conference (PC) neta Sajad Lone of helping BJP by abstaining from voting, and “now lecturing us like a professor”.The retort came after Lone alleged that “all the cross-voting was done by NC”. “Omar Abdullah is the biggest supporter of BJP, bigger than their own leaders. The Rajya Sabha polls were a fixed match between BJP and NC. It was pre-decided that NC would take three seats and BJP one,” the PC chief told reporters.BJP on Friday sprang a surprise in J&K’s first RS elections since the abrogation of Article 370, winning a seat with 32 votes --- four more than its strength of 28 in the assembly.Farooq added more spice to the political debate, claiming that BJP had approached NC before the polls. Addressing a presser alongside the elected NC candidates, he said: “People will say whatever they have to say, but we didn’t gift any seat to BJP. They came to us ahead of the polls asking us for one seat. We refused and decided to fight it out.”Referring to Farooq’s statement, Lone said it was an admission that BJP and NC remained in touch. “That means a dialogue mechanism exists between the two parties. That means they had discussions about Rajya Sabha (polls)... Isn’t that what we have been saying all along --- fixed match,” he said.Jailed AAP legislator Mehraj Malik issued a statement saying he voted for NC in “the larger interests of J&K” despite no one from the party approaching him, but was “now being questioned by some of their leaders”. NC spokesperson Ifra Jasn had accused the Doda MLA of voting for BJP.",BJP won one of the four Rajya Sabha seats in J&K with support from four legislators outside the party on Friday.

Bihar polls: Sunset before sunrise for Jan Suraaj? 3 key challenges before the 'challenger',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-sunset-before-sunrise-for-jan-suraaj-3-key-challenges-before-the-challenger/articleshow/124804960.cms,"Jan Suraaj Party's Prashant Kishor Drops Bombshell, Reveals Why He Will Not Contest Bihar Elections

Challenges ahead of the challenger





Candidates’ desertion

Anger among party workers

Whose “B team” is Jan Suraaj anyway?

NEW DELHI: Bihar has long been a laboratory for political parties to test their ""prayogs"" to clinch power. The latest addition to such experiments is poll strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor 's Jan Suraaj, which has emerged as a third option for voters in the upcoming assembly elections and challenged the socialist forces — Janata Dal (United) and Rashtriya Janata Dal — by fielding candidates on all 243 seats.Prashant has been camping in Bihar for three years. He formed his party on October 2, 2024, vowing to contest the elections on the plank of development. However, as the elections inch closer, several challenges seem to surround PK and his party, making the climb to Ek Anne Marg even steeper.Jan Suraaj has been defeated on at least three seats as candidates walked out even before a single vote has been cast — Dr Shashi Shekhar Sinha from Gopalganj, Dr Satya Prakash Tiwari from Brahmpur (Buxar), and Akhilesh Kumar alias Mutor Sao from the Danapur seat in Patna.Additionally, Jan Suraaj leaders, including state spokesperson Amit Kumar Paswan, former district councillor Anita Kumari, and founding member Karmveer Paswan, have also recently joined the BJP ahead of the elections.However, Prashant Kishor accused the Bharatiya Janata Party and Union minister Amit Shah of “coercing and intimidating” his party’s candidates out of fear of losing the elections.“Look at this picture: you can see home minister Amit Shah and Dharmendra Pradhan.You talk about the model code of conduct... the home minister kept a candidate with him for one full day so that he could not file his nomination,” Kishor alleged.Meanwhile, party workers are also upset with Jan Suraaj's choice of candidates across the state. Workers have accused the party and Prashant Kishor of deceiving them by dropping “parachute candidates” after they had done all the groundwork for the elections.Speaking to The Times of India, Jan Suraaj leader Ravi Nandan Sahay said that probable candidates had deposited Rs 21,000 each to contest elections on the Jan Suraaj symbol from Kumhrar. However, the party chose former Patna University vice-chancellor KC Sinha from the constituency, who had not even formally joined the party.“The party workers are feeling cheated. The party had promised that tickets would only be given to a person among the probable candidates. However, I was shocked by the party’s decision to field KC Sinha from Kumhrar, who had not formally joined the party till then. Each probable candidate was also mandated to hold sabhas and distribute Parivaar Labhaarthi cards. All our efforts went in vain,” Sahay said.“Now, almost every probable candidate has left the party and decided to contest the poll independently. This will cause a significant dent in Jan Suraaj during the campaign,” he added.In the run-up to the assembly elections, both the Mahagathbandhan and NDA have accused Jan Suraaj of being the “B team” of each other. The perception has also seeped among voters who remain unsure about PK’s political allegiance.“Kishor realised that he would not win elections, and that is why he announced that he would not contest polls. Whatever he had invested in forming the Jan Suraaj Party has already been recovered. His party is nothing but a *vote katwa* (a party that cuts into others’ votes),” Union Minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh alleged after Prashant Kishor decided not to contest from Raghopur against RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.“Jan Suraaj is the ‘B team’ of the RJD,” Giriraj Singh added.Meanwhile, the RJD has maintained its accusation that Jan Suraaj is the “B team” of the Nitish Kumar-led ruling alliance in Bihar.Now, it remains to be seen how Prashant Kishor persuades voters that his party is a viable alternative and not merely a vote katwa or spoiler in the upcoming elections.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar Assembly elections. The 243 assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases — on November 6 and November 11 — with the counting of votes scheduled for November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, compared to 7.89 crore in the first draft list released before the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) on June 24 this year. According to an Election Commission release, around 65 lakh voters were removed during the revision process, bringing the number of electors in the updated draft list, as of August 1, 2025, to 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly elections, the BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share. Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with a 15.7% vote share. Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) contested seven seats, winning four, and secured 0.9% of the vote share.","Prashant Kishor has been camping in Bihar for three years.

Bihar polls: BJP almost confirms Nitish Kumar is NDA’s CM pick,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-bjp-almost-confirms-nitish-kumar-is-ndas-cm-pick/articleshow/124773868.cms,"""Congress Only Party To Respect Him..."" Pappu Yadav Alleges BJP Sidelining Nitish Kumar in NDA

PATNA: Nitish Kumar is the leader and CM of NDA govt in Bihar and people trust him and PM Narendra Modi to deliver on their promises in the state, BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said Thursday while NDA tore into INDIA bloc after the opposition named RJD ’s Tejashwi Prasad as its chief ministerial face before elections in Nov. NDA called the bloc’s move a “shameful alliance of corruption and opportunism”.“Charges have already been framed against Tejashwi in the IRCTC case. The court has stated that this is a very serious case of corruption. Tejashwi is an accused in this case under Section 420 of the IPC,” Prasad said. When reporters asked him who will be the NDA’s CM face, Prasad said: “Where is a vacancy?”BJP, JDU, and LJP (Ram Vilas) functionaries — joined by political strategist-turned-activist Prashant Kishor — accused the opposition bloc of pushing Bihar toward a “return of jungle raj” under the shadow of the alleged scam. Bihar deputy CM Samrat Choudhary of BJP said RJD was “torturing even its allies”. “This is a day of shame for Bihar that Grand Alliance promised to make the son of a thief the CM for sake of power. Everyone knows when Lalu was in office, criminals were encouraged. They want to bring back the same govt, and Congress is encouraging this.”The IRCTC land-for-jobs scam dates back to the period when RJD chief Lalu Prasad, as railway minister during first UPA govt of 2004-2009, allegedly awarded contracts for two railway hotels in exchange for land plots transferred to a firm linked to his family.Both Lalu and Tejashwi have denied wrongdoing, calling the case politically motivated.UP deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya said RJD-Congress tie-up was “a mismatched game”, recalling that Lalu was jailed during Congress’s tenure. “Now he is aligned with the same Congress. This alliance will not work in Bihar,” Maurya said.Union minister and LJP (RV) chief Chirag Paswan mocked the alliance for sidelining Congress. “After so many controversies, what would they do if they accepted your face? Congress was insulted as the face of just one man was visible in the entire press conference,” he said.JDU targeted both Tejashwi and INDIA bloc’s social arithmetic, taking a swipe at reports VIP chief Mukesh Sahani was promised the deputy CM post. “Laddoos for 2.60% of the Mallahs, pumpkins for 18% of the Muslims. Are Muslims there only to scare them to vote?” JDU wrote on X.Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor ridiculed Tejashwi’s promise to provide govt jobs to one member of every family. “The one who promises three crore jobs isn’t saying what he did when his parents were in power. Now all that’s left to hear is that Tejashwi will make Bihar a golden Lanka in a few days,” he said.BJP national spokesperson Ajay Alok said Congress had “sold its self-respect” by agreeing to Tejashwi’s projection. “Sitting on a stage where Rahul Gandhi’s photo was not even on the poster, Ashok Gehlot exposed his party’s helplessness by declaring Tejashwi as CM face.... Let Nov 14 come, they will be seen fighting each other,” he said, referring to the date of poll results.","BJP, JDU, and LJP functionaries accuse the opposition bloc of pushing Bihar toward a “return of jungle raj” under the shadow of the alleged scam.

Deletions took place using VoIP between Dec 2022 & Feb 2023





BENGALURU: Karnataka police’s special investigation team probing the alleged voter deletion scam in Aland constituency during the 2023 assembly polls has reportedly uncovered evidence of attempts to remove names from the electoral rolls, and identified six suspects.Sleuths said deletions were carried out at a cyber centre in Aland, where operators were allegedly paid Rs 80 per application. SIT sources said they suspect accused paid Rs 4.8 lakh to those who facilitated the deletions. Officials are probing how the centre gained access to EC’s portal to file fake voter deletion requests. The probe was carried out by CID cyber crime unit before SIT took over. “At least 6,000 votes have been allegedly deleted,” a CID official said.According to CID sources, preliminary findings show that the deletions took place between Dec 2022 and Feb 2023 using voice over internet protocol (VoIP). “There were requests to delete 6,994 votes. While a few were genuine, most were bogus. The applications allegedly targeted Dalit and minority voters. The deletions were halted after the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) ordered a status quo,” CID officials said.The irregularities have been traced to local resident Mohammed Ashfaq, who was questioned in Feb 2023 and let off. He is currently in Dubai and a blue corner notice is being processed to locate him.Aland, part of Kalaburagi district, is represented by Congress MLA B R Patil. He along with Kalaburagi district minister Priyank Kharge were the first to flag the irregularities to the CEO. The Congress govt later formed the SIT, headed by Additional Director General of Police B K Singh, after Rahul Gandhi raised allegations of vote theft in Aland— the home turf of Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge.Reacting to the reports, Priyank Kharge posted on X: ``Voters deleted for just Rs 80 in Aland. The latest findings from the Karnataka SIT confirm what we've been saying all along, over 6,000 genuine voters were struck off the rolls through a paid operation ahead of the 2023 elections in Aland. A full-fledged data centre was operating out of Kalaburagi, where operators were systematically deleting voters' names and tampering with our democratic process. All investigations now point to foul play by BJP functionaries and their associates. Every dirty trick and modus operandi from the BJP's #VoteChori playbook will be exposed, and every single person responsible will be held accountable and put behind bars.”On Oct 17, SIT searched the residences of former BJP MLA Subhash Guttedar, his sons, and their chartered accountant Mallikarjun Mahantagol, seizing seven laptops and several mobile phones.Following the revelations, Congress accused the BJP of vote theft, calling it a direct assault on democracy. “The truth about the BJP's vote theft is now before the country. The cost of deleting a vote was Rs 80. This exposé pertains to just one assembly seat. This 'vote theft' by BJP is a direct attack on democracy—where the rights of the poor and marginalised are being snatched, and their voices suppressed,” the party posted on X.Aland MLA BR Patil said he is unaware of the headway made by SIT and declined to comment, adding, “SIT is moving in the right direction.”","Sleuths said deletions were carried out at a cyber centre in Aland, where operators were allegedly paid Rs 80 per application.
