CHANDIGARH: Nayab Singh Saini was sworn in as Haryana CM on Thursday for the second time, at a ceremony at Panchkula, near state capital Chandigarh, attended by PM Narendra Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, home minister Amit Shah, several Central ministers and CMs of many BJP-ruled states.A large crowd at the Dussehra Ground watched Haryana governor Bandaru Dattatreya administering the oath of office to the low-profile OBC leader and 13 others.Those sworn in as ministers include Anil Vij, Krishan Lal Panwar, Rao Narbir Singh Mahipal Dhanda, Vipul Goel, Arvind Sharma, Shyam Singh Rana, Ranbir Gangwa, Krishan Bedi, Shruti Chaudhary , Arti Singh Rao , Gaurav Gautam and Rajesh Nagar. While 11 of them were inducted as cabinet ministers, Gaurav Gautam and Rajesh Nagar were made ministers of state (independent charge). Anil Vij took oath of office immediately after Saini, signalling that he was at no. 2 position in the new govt.Congratulating Saini and his ministers on their swearing-in, Modi described the team as a wonderful mix of good governance and experience. “This govt will realise the dreams of people and take state’s development to a new high,"" he posted on X in Hindi. Saini also thanked the people of Haryana for their mandate and the PM for his “inspirational leadership.”“With full majority for the third time, the BJP govt will work with full energy for good governance, equality and welfare of the poor,” the CM posted on X. Portfolios of the newly inducted ministers are expected to be allotted on Friday when the first cabinet meeting has been called.Both the women ministers in Saini cabinet come from political dynasties of Haryana, as both their grandfathers served as CMs. While Shruti Chaudhary is granddaughter of former Haryana CM Bansi Lal, Arti Singh Rao is the granddaughter of former CM Rao Birender Singh. Shruti’s mother Kiran Chaudhary is Rajya Sabha MP and Arti’s father Rao Inderjeet Singh is a Gurgaon BJP MP and a Union minister. The three independents, Savitri Jindal from Hisar, Devender Kadian from Ganaur and Rajesh Joon from Bahadurgarh, had backed the BJP, but didn’t make it. Even Ram Kumar Gautam, who had been elected from Safidon and was seen as a strong contender, did not get one.While two ministers each have been taken from Faridabad and Panipat districts, Panchkula, Kaithal Karnal, Dadri, Rohtak, Jhajjar and Rewari have remained unrepresented as the party failed to open its account in Sirsa, Fatehabad and Mewat this time. One minister each has been inducted from Ambala, Yamunanagar, Kurukshetra, Sonipat, Jind, Hisar, Bhiwani, Mahendergarh, Gurgaon and Palwal districts.Two of the ministers are OBCs, two SCs, two Jats, two Yadavs, two Brahmins while one each from Rajput, Gujjar and Vaishya (Bania) communities has been given representation in the cabinet.Saini visited Valmiki Bhawan and offered prayers at a gurdwara and the Mansa Devi temple in Panchkula.","Nayab Singh Saini was sworn in as Haryana CM on Thursday for the second time.

J&K HC to set up special bench to hear plea against LG’s power to nominate 5 MLAs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-hc-to-set-up-special-bench-to-hear-plea-against-lgs-power-to-nominate-5-mlas/articleshow/114327835.cms,"JAMMU: The Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh High Court will constitute a special bench to hear a PIL challenging the power vested in the lieutenant governor to nominate five members to the legislative assembly of the Union Territory.Chief Justice Tashi Rabstan agreed to constitute a special division bench on Monday after petitioner Ravinder Sharma , senior vice-president of J&K Pradesh Congress Committee and a former MLC, sought an urgent hearing.On Oct 14, a division bench of the Supreme Court had declined to hear a similar plea filed by Sharma, and had asked him to approach the high court first.The petition challenges the provisions of the J&K Reorganisation Act that empower the LG to nominate five MLAs to the 90-member assembly, taking its total strength to 95. The provisions had been inserted in the 2019 Act through an amendment in Dec 2023, triggering a massive uproar ahead of the recently held assembly elections, with opposition parties fearing it could alter the composition of the House. They alleged that the provisions were brought in to tilt the numbers in favour of BJP-NDA , in case of a close or hung verdict.With the National Conference-Congress alliance getting a clear mandate, NC vice-president Omar Abdullah on Oct 9 urged the Centre and LG Manoj Sinha not to unnecessarily create a political conflict by making the nominations.“Nominating these five will not change the govt. So, what is the use of it? You will unnecessarily nominate five people to sit in the opposition,” said Omar, who took oath as chief minister on Wednesday.Earlier, PDP leader Iltija Mufti had alleged a day before the counting of votes on Oct 8 that empowering the LG to nominate five members was a “brazen pre-result rigging”.BJP’s J&K chief Ravinder Raina had, on the other hand, defended the provision, saying the power had been given to the LG through an Act of Parliament, and that the nomination of MLAs would be “in accordance with the constitutional process”.","The petition challenges the provisions of the J&K Reorganisation Act that empower the LG to nominate five MLAs to the 90-member assembly.

SC decides to monitor detection & deportation of aliens from Assam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-decides-to-monitor-detection-deportation-of-aliens-from-assam/articleshow/114330476.cms,"Under Section 6A , those Bangladeshi migrants who entered Assam before Jan 1, 1966, would be deemed Indian citizens, whereas those who came to the state between Jan 1966 and March 24, 1971, were to be given citizenship after 10 years subject to certain conditions.While the majority opinion running into 185 pages, authored by Justice Surya Kant for himself and Justices M M Sundresh and Manoj Misra, went beyond the validity of Section 6A and delved into the cultural and demographic crisis faced by inhabitants of Assam because of illegal influx of Bangladeshi migrants and prescribed remedial steps, CJI D Y Chandrachud stopped at upholding the validity of Section 6A.Justice J B Pardiwala dissented and quashed Section 6A prospectively.Illegal entry of Bangladeshis, which has been going on since the country's partition in 1947, has been a wedge issue with BJP and AGP campaigning against it as a threat to the country's integrity and security and a ""plot"" to change the demography in border areas, and their opponents accusing them of exaggerating the problem due to the Muslim faith of the illegal immigrants.The issue, which played a major role in BJP's rise as the dominant force in Assam at the expense of Congress and, interestingly, AGP, has already become a key theme in the approaching Jharkhand polls.Justice Kant dealt with the situation arising from unchecked infiltration of Bangladeshi migrants threatening to swamp Assam, and referred to a two decade-old judgment in Sarbananda Sonowal case in which the SC had observed that ""there can be no manner of doubt that the state of Assam is facing 'external aggression and internal disturbance' on account of largescale illegal migration of Bangladeshi nationals"".""Immigrants who entered Assam on or after March 25, 1971, are not entitled to the protection conferred vide Section 6A and, consequently, they are declared to be illegal immigrants. Accordingly, Section 6A has become redundant qua those immigrants who have entered Assam on or after March 25, 1971,"" Justices Kant, Sundresh and Misra said.The majority held that the directions issued for identification, detection and deportation of illegal Bangladeshi migrants who entered Assam after Mar 25, 1971, must be implemented expeditiously. Importantly, it said five laws - Immigrants (Expulsion from Assam) Act, 1950; Foreigners Act, 1946; Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964; Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920; and Passport Act, 1967 - must act in tandem to give effect to the legislative objective of Section 6A, that is not to permit any illegal Bangladeshi migrant to enter Assam after March 25, 1971.Finding that the SC's directives in the Sonowal judgment had not been implemented properly even after 20 years as only 97,714 cases were pending before Foreigners Tribunals even though millions of illegal Bangladeshi migrants have entered the state, the SC decided to monitor progress of detection and deportation of such migrants from now.""Implementation of immigration and citizenship legislations cannot be left to the mere wish and discretion of the authorities, necessitating constant monitoring by this court,"" Kant said.In his 94-page opinion, CJI Chandrachud said, ""The legislative objective of Section 6A was to balance the humanitarian needs of migrants of Indian origin and the impact of the migration on the economic and cultural needs of Indian states. The two yardsticks employed in Section 6A, that is migration to Assam and the cut-off date of March 24, 1971, are reasonable.""","Under Section 6A, Bangladeshi migrants who entered Assam before Jan 1, 1966, would be deemed Indian citizens. Those who came to the state between Jan 1966 and March 24, 1971, were to be given citizenship after 10 years subject to certain conditions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114330509,imgsize-1428574,width-400,resizemode-4/114330509.jpg"

The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections , which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases. The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114248739,imgsize-47642,width-400,resizemode-4/114248739.jpg"
