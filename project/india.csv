"With Uttarakhand UCC, BJP delivers on another part of 'core' agenda",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-uttarakhand-ucc-bjp-delivers-on-another-part-of-core-agenda/articleshow/117614921.cms,"Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami during an event to announce the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code (Photo credit: PTI)

NEW DELHI: By getting its govt to promulgate UCC in Uttarakhand, BJP has signalled its allegiance to one of its foundational pledges and assured its cadre and supporters of its bonafides.Given difficulties involved in implementing UCC across the country, BJP decided to approach the task incrementally. Issues concerning marriage and divorce fall in the Concurrent List, the terrain where both the Centre and states are competent to make laws, and this afforded a way out. So did the demography of the Hindu-preponderant Uttarakhand that ruled out the risk of any large-scale disruption.Also read: If tribals agree, they would also be brought under UCC, says Dhami While the legislation was supposed to be the baby of the state govt, it was Centre that, for all practical purposes, negotiated the process - right from choices of members of the committee headed by retired SC judge Ranjana Desai.Home minister Amit Shah was closely involved in the process and would regularly hold deliberations with CM Pushkar Dhami. The collaboration enhanced the possibility of Uttarakhand UCC being a pilot for similar laws being planned by BJP-governed UP, Gujarat & Assam. Assam CM Himanta Sarma appears to be especially keen to get going.With UCC in Uttarakhand in place and others expected to follow suit, BJP can claim to have delivered on another component of its 'core' agenda. The party has already made good on its promises on construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, scrapping J&K's special status and criminalising triple talaq. That Uttarakhand UCC came into force the same day when BJP, along with its allies, deployed its majority to push through crucial amendments to Waqf Act was sheer coincidence. The JPC on Waqf would have wrapped up its business in winter session itself if govt had its way.But the coincidence only served to amplify the message of BJP delivering on its promises and enhances the prospect of similar actions both in Delhi and in BJP-administered state capitals.In its third term, Modi govt had revived the issue by referring UCC to the Law Commission once again. The parliamentary standing committee on law and justice simultaneously took up the subject for study and building consensus with different stakeholders. Short of recommending UCC, Law Commission, in its 2018 'consultation paper', had suggested wide-ranging reforms in various family laws to bring gender justice and equality. It recommended uniform age for marriage, its compulsory registration, age of majority (18 years) to be recognised as legal age for men and women for marriage, uniform application of laws for bigamy and divorce with provision for maintenance, recognising polygamy as a criminal offence, recognising adultery as a gender neutral offence and ground for divorce, besides uniform laws for adoption, succession and inheritance.","By getting its govt to promulgate UCC in Uttarakhand, BJP has signalled its allegiance to one of its foundational pledges.

If he (Sanjay Roy) is hanged now, how will we get further evidence? RG Kar victim’s father

KOLKATA: Even as the CBI and Bengal govt sparred on Monday in the Calcutta high court over whose appeal seeking death for RG Kar rape-murder convict Sanjay Roy should be heard, the victim's family told the HC they did not want capital punishment for the convict for now.The HC division bench of Justice Debangsu Basak and Justice Md Shabbar Rashidi reserved its judgment on whether it would hear the CBI's or the state's appeal. Thereafter, it will hear the merits of the case seeking capital punishment.When the judges asked the victim's parents, who were present in court, about their stand on the issue, their counsel Shamim Ahmed informed the bench that the family ""does not want capital punishment for now"" as they were apprehensive that Roy's hanging could lead to the disappearance of whatever evidence there might be to prove the involvement of others. Another lawyer representing the parents said, ""We want the trial of others to start and chargesheet to be submitted.""The parents later told reporters outside the courtroom, ""Capital punishment to the convict now could hamper the investigation that we have sought. If he (Roy) is hanged now, how will we get further evidence?""A Sealdah trial court had on Jan 20 sentenced Roy to prison ""for the remainder of his natural life"", saying the case did not fall under the ""rarest of rare"" category. The state govt, and later CBI, appealed against this.When the case came up for hearing, state advocate general Kishore Datta told the HC that the state had locus standi to appeal seeking death for the convict even though the investigation was conducted by a central agency. ""In a case being investigated by a central agency, the state is not a bystander because prosecution is always in the name of the state... registration of an FIR is with the state govt, post-trial - parole, remission, capital punishment execution - everything is done by the state,"" Datta argued.Representing the CBI, additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju said only the Centre could file an appeal seeking the death penalty and the Bengal govt did not have ""any jurisdiction"" in the matter.","CBI and Bengal govt spar in Calcutta high court over whose appeal seeking death for rape-murder convict Sanjay Roy should be heard.

NEW DELHI: As opposition dubbed proceedings of joint parliamentary committee on Waqf Amendment Bill as a 'mockery' and its impending report 'pre-decided', DMK MP A Raja announced that his party will move Supreme Court to strike down the new law if it is approved by Parliament.Eleven opposition members on the JPC issued a joint statement accusing committee chairperson Jagdambika Pal of violating panel rules and procedures. Slamming Pal of ""acting at behest of"" Centre, they said their sincere efforts to protect the constitutional assurances given to minorities have been defeated. ""The awkward and solo acting of the chairman... made him a painter to enable Union govt to give saffron colour to this secular nation by using its brutal majority in Parliament,"" the statement said, exhorting citizens to protect the rights of minorities and social harmony.They said the chairperson did not allow opposition members to place their views on the amendments and had not made available to members minutes of the meetings held in Delhi and other places. They said 95% of the stakeholders who deposed before the panel opposed the bill. ""No discussion on clause by clause was permitted by the chairman, which is an essential element in the process,"" the statement said, signed by Raja, Kalyan Banerjee, Gaurav Gogoi, Asaduddin Owaisi, Syed Naseer Hussain, Mohibbullah, Imran Masood, MM Abdulla, Mohd Jawed, Arvind Sawant, Nadimul Haque.The MPs said the JPC toured Patna, Kolkata and Lucknow on Jan 18, 20, 21, to hear stakeholders of respective states, and the chairperson directed the stakeholders to submit their views within 15 days. ""These documents are yet to reach the committee for perusal of the members,"" the statement said.They said they protested to the chairman that clause-by-clause discussion could not take place without depositions of stakeholders, but their plea was ignored. They alleged Pal moved the opposition's amendments himself, and conducted the headcount to decide their fate, calling the process adopted a grave departure from the established rules.The members lamented that JPC meets were scheduled for Jan 24 and 25 for clause-by-clause discussion on the bill, but its agenda was changed at last moment. The MPs said when they raised the issue, they were ""suspended undemocratically"".","Eleven opposition members on the JPC issued a joint statement accusing committee chairperson Jagdambika Pal of violating panel rules and procedures.

NEW DELHI: BJP on Monday lashed out at Congress MP Rahul Gandhi , attributing his attack on the media to frustration from continuous political failures .""Instead of introspecting on his failures, Rahul has made a habit of blaming institutions. His behaviour exemplifies the saying, 'a bad workman quarrels with his tools',"" BJP spokesperson Anil Baluni said.BJP was reacting to Rahul's comments at an event in MP's Mhow where he accused the media of ignoring critical issues affecting common people, particularly farmers. He criticised the media for allegedly aligning with business groups, thus neglecting the broader public's concerns.Baluni said Rahul's pattern of criticism extends beyond just the media. ""When he lost elections, he made derogatory remarks against Election Commission and questioned the integrity of EVMs. Now, it seems the media is his new target,"" he said, suggesting that these attacks stem from frustration and desperation.He also highlighted the historical tension between Congress and the press, recalling the 1975 Emergency under Indira Gandhi, where media censorship was enforced.

'False, misleading' claims: Delhi Jal Board

Atishi, Bhagwant Mann's letter to Election Commissioner

The Delhi Chief Minister Atishi accused the ruling BJP in Haryana of deliberately draining industrial waste into the Yamuna river, calling it ""water terrorism"" on Monday.Atishi alleged that the BJP is deliberately disrupting Delhi's water supply as they face a historic loss in the upcoming Assembly polls. She pointed out that the ammonia level in the Yamuna has skyrocketed to an unprecedented 7.2 parts per million due to the discharge of industrial waste into the river. ""Since Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal and I exposed the conspiracy by the BJP to send poisonous water to Delhi, the BJP appointed its Lieutenant Governor to pressurise Delhi Jal Board officers. However, the letter written by the CEO of Delhi Jal Board confirms our claims. BJP government in Haryana is sending poisonous water to Delhi,"" she said.Further questioning BJP's intentions asserting the claims, Atishi questioned, ""Are they trying to kill the people of Delhi because they are losing the elections? I want to tell the BJP-if you want to fight elections, fight us face to face. Don’t engage in such dirty politics.""This came after AAP national convenor and Atishi's predecessor Arvind Kejriwal alleged that the BJP is trying to kill people by mixing ""poison"" in the river.AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal, earlier in the day, also accused BJP of mixing poison in the water coming to Delhi from Haryana. He said, ""The BJP government there is mixing poison in the water coming from Haryana,"" said Kejriwal. Further attacking the BJP, he also said, ""The country has never seen such dirty politics till date. If the people of Delhi are not voting for BJP, will you kill the people of Delhi by giving them water mixed with poison?""Additionally, he credited the Jal Board engineers for identifying the problem and stopping the water at the border. Kejriwal added to his statement that if ""this water had come into Delhi and gotten mixed with the drinking water, don't know how many people Delhi would have died- this would have been a mass genocide.""Also read: 'BJP government in Haryana mixing poison in water coming to Delhi,' claims Arvind Kejriwal ahead of Delhi polls The Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini hit back at the claims of the ""poisonous water"", saying it's the 'AAP's habit to blame others and run away', asserting that the people of Delhi will teach them a lesson in the February 5 Assembly polls.Saini said, ""I asked them (the AAP government in Delhi) to send their chief secretary and said I will ask my chief secretary to check the quality of the water at Sonipat, from where the Yamuna enters Delhi. Anyone can check the water quality there."" He added, ""They are talking about ammonia, but there is no shortage of water. There is an issue in their (Delhi's) distribution system.... He (Kejriwal) should work instead of making allegations.""Later, BJP sources quoted by news agency PTI suggested that Haryana administration plans to sue Kejriwal regarding his allegations and file a complaint with the Election Commission.Haryana minister Anil Vij also echoed Saini and blamed Kejriwal. ""Arvind Kejriwal is a factory of lies... Take all journalists and analysts to the place where Yamuna enters Delhi and check the quality of water, and then check the quality of water in Delhi. They will see the difference,"" said the labour minister of Haryana. Further slamming the AAAP chief he added, ""Its not our job to clean the river in Delhi, it was Arvind Kejriwal's job, which he could not do.""The Delhi Jal Board's CEO wrote to the Delhi chief secretary, calling the statements of Atishi and Kejriwal ""false"" and saying they might lead to fear-mongering among people. The DJB regularly monitors the quality of incoming water and regulates supplies based on various parameters.""As it's in annual winter season & people of Delhi are assured that there is no cause of concern for drinking water quality in the city. CEO DJB, in a detailed report, has apprised the Chief Secretary with a request to bring this to the attention of the Hon’ble Lieutenant Governor,"" later said the Jal Board.This row started with Delhi CM Atishi and Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann wrote a joint letter addressed to chief election commissioner with the accusations over the increased ammonia levels in the water coming to Delhi from Haryana.In their complaint to the EC, Atishi and Mann alleged that there has been a deliberate attempt by the Haryana government to jeopardize Delhi's water supply, which could have serious consequences for the conduct of free and fair elections in the capital.Atishi said in the complaint, ""I am sure you will agree that denying their rightful share of water to 34 lakh people in Delhi amounts to water terrorism, and is a blatant attempt to cause panic and chaos across Delhi, thereby influencing the free-and-fair nature of the Delhi election.""As the campaigning for the Delhi Assembly polls intensifies, with the election scheduled for February 5 and results to be announced on February 8, allegations and counter-allegations continue to fuel the capital's political atmosphere.","Delhi Chief Minister Atishi accused the ruling BJP in Haryana of deliberately draining industrial waste into the Yamuna river.

KOLKATA: The 76th Republic Day saw an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation between the Bengal govt and Raj Bhavan over Kolkata Police band 's participation at the traditional ""At Home"" R-Day ceremony.Five seniors of the state administration, including CM Mamata Banerjee, waited outside the Raj Bhavan gates on Sunday afternoon after learning that the KP band was not being allowed to participate in the R-Day ceremony.

""I have called them but they are not performing. The governor's house is not under the Centre but (under) the state. Please remember this.

She later had a detailed discussion with governor C V Ananda Bose on the Raj Bhavan lawns.Officer on special duty to the governor, Sandeep Singh, later issued a statement: ""The KP band was assigned space different from the usual for the At Home ceremony. I intervened when this was pointed out to me and called the police bandset and gave them a suitable place where they performed.

Dhodi has been missing since the evening of 20 January.Akash alleged that his youngest uncle, along with his associates involved in selling Daman-based liquor, is behind the kidnapping. He also accused the uncle of threatening his mother over property disputes in the past. A missing person’s complaint was filed on 22 January, and the police have since registered a case under the ""Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita"" (BNS) sections for kidnapping and abduction with intent to kill or cause harm.Ashok had travelled to Mira Road on 19 January and returned to Dahanu the following evening. He called his family while on his way home to inform them about his arrival and asked them to keep food ready. However, he never arrived at his house in Vevaji village, Talasari taluka.The family tried repeatedly to contact him, but both his mobile phones were switched off. On 21 January, a villager informed Akash that he had seen Ashok’s car speeding through the area at around 7.30 pm on 20 January. Following this information, the family filed a missing complaint, and police, along with the family, began search operations. CCTV footage also confirmed that his red car was seen on the evening of 20 January.While searching the mountains near Vevaji village the next day, Akash found some of Ashok’s belongings, including a slipper, blood-stained documents, spectacles, and shattered car glass. These items were collected as evidence by the police.Akash then alerted the authorities about his suspicions regarding his uncle, Avinash Dhodi. In his FIR, Akash stated that five to six years ago, Avinash had threatened his mother, saying he would kill Ashok and make her a widow. He also alleged that Avinash had made two previous attempts to harm his father within the past year. Additionally, Ashok had opposed Avinash’s involvement in selling Daman-based liquor and had lodged complaints with the excise department and police, which Akash believes could have motivated the crime.“My husband, Ashok Dhodi, went to Mumbai on the 19th evening by train and returned on the 20th. While on his way home via the Dahanu-Gholvad road, he called me to keep the food ready. But after that, his number has been switched off,” said Late, Dhodi’s wife.Kundan Sankhe, a senior Shiv Sena (Shinde) leader, said, “We are in touch with the police investigating the case. It has been seven days since his disappearance, and his car has been spotted in CCTV footage. The investigation needs to pick up speed.”Palghar SP Balasaheb Patil said, “We have dispatched teams who are actively investigating the case and are in regular contact with the Dhodi family.”","Ashok Dhodi, a coordinator for the Dahanu-Talasari assembly with the Shiv Sena (Shinde), has been missing since the evening of 20 January.
