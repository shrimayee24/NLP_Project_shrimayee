While a three-member panel of doctors had initially refused to conduct the autopsy in the evening, the OC authorised the postmortem between 6.10pm and 7.10pm due to ""some urgent matter"". Victim's parents had also accused the OC of pressuring them to cremate the body.

The home minister of India was scared to go to Lal Chowk,” he said, adding that “enemies of the nation” took advantage of the three families. Thousands of children lost their lives, the PM said.“The three families have corrupted J&K. You were made to struggle for small things. Govt jobs were given only to those affiliated with the families. They looted your land.

Tripura police accused of not arresting criminals for lynching,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tripura-police-accused-of-not-arresting-criminals-for-lynching/articleshow/113355573.cms,"Tripura police launched an investigation into the lynching of 22 -yrs old Gautam Das but even after three days, they couldn’t arrest the FIR-accused person yet, which triggered a serious reaction across the state.Allegedly, a few leaders of the BJP 's Yuva Morcha have been accused of beating Goutam to death in the presence of police after he was handed over to his family on September 10 at Natun Bazar police station of Tripura’s Gomati district in connection with a romantic relationship.Justifying the non-arrest of the accused persons SP Gomati Gautam Das Namit Pathak said, “We are waiting for the postmortem report to ascertain the cause of death before arrest, as apparently the body didn’t have any assault mark. However, the case has been monitored very seriously.According to the details of the incident, Gautam, a resident of Amarpur Chelagang of Gomati district, developed a relationship with a 19-year-old girl from Aravinda Colony area. Gautam eloped with the girl on Sept 5 and the family complained to police.Police rescued the girl from the house of her boyfriend Gautam Das in Sabroom and brought them to Natun Bazar. But since both are adults, the police handed them over to the respective families. As soon as Goutam came out from the police station, allegedly a group of youths led by a local BJP youth leader Saugata assaulted him badly in front of the police station in the presence of the man in uniform, the victim’s father alleged.He stated that some leaders of Yuva Morcha took Gautam to the house of the girl for an amicable settlement and again beat him severely there. Later, with serious injuries, Gautam was admitted first to Natun Bazar Hospital and then referred to Agartala Govt Medical College where he died. Based on the complaint of the victim’s father police registered a case but did not arrest anyone.Both opposition CPI-M and Congress questioned the role of police and alleged, “Police and criminals are hands in glove with the patronize of the party in power.” Congress MLA Sudip Roybarman slammed the police and said, “Why have police been waiting to arrest the culprits when there was a direct complaint? Does the law allow police to wait for medical reports in murder cases before arrest?”Roybarman further alleged that in the maximum criminal cases, ruling party cadres and their family members were found accused, and police didn’t respond immediately, which the people of Tripura witnessed in some recent cases including the lynching of a school teacher in Udaipur of Gomati district.Finally, almost after a week when the Chief Minister intervened four persons were arrested and now in jail. Keeping the CM in the dark, a group of BJP leaders in connivance with the police helped the criminals discredit the Chief Minister Dr Manik Saha, he observed adding, “Every day we are seeing how Dr Saha is being faced trouble by his partymen and leaders.”","Tripura police launched an investigation into the lynching of 22 -yrs old Gautam Das but even after three days, they couldn't arrest the FIR-accused person yet.

Cong holds protests on second anniversary of MLA defections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/cong-holds-protests-on-second-anniversary-of-mla-defections/articleshow/113356224.cms,"Panaji/Margao/Calangute: Congress on Saturday held protests across Calangute, Old Goa, Margao, and Vasco to mark the second anniversary of the defection of eight Congress MLAs to BJP. The protest was held to draw attention to the defection two years ago when a group of legislators changed their allegiance and joined the ruling BJP.Led by state party president, Amit Patkar , Congress workers burnteffigies of the eight MLAs who defected.At Lohia Maidan, workers condemned the “betrayal” of the voters by the defectors. Patkar said, “Despite the MLAs deserting the party, the recent Lok Sabha election results proved that the voters remained loyal to Congress.”He addedthat the doors of Congress have been “permanently closed” for the defectors who “robbed the people's mandate”.The MLAs who defected to BJP two years ago were, Digambar Kamat, Michael Lobo, his wife Delilah, Rajesh Phaldesai, Kedar Naik, Sankalp Amonkar, Aleixo Sequeira, and Rudolfo Fernandes. Post the defection, Congress was left with only three MLAs in the state assembly; Yuri Alemao from Cuncolim, Carlos Ferreira from Aldona and Altone D'Costa from Quepem.The leader of opposition, Alemao said that defection is a political and social crime, adding, “BJP is promoting it ( defections ) to usurp powers. Speaker Ramesh Tawadkar has failed to dispose of the disqualification petition in 90 days; it seems he is waiting for the completion of 900 days. We condemn the BJP strategy of promoting defection,” he said.Aldona MLA Carlos Alvares Ferreira accused the MLAs of acting in their personal interests rather than for the development of their constituencies. Patkar said that some of the MLAs who defected have been allegedly involved in converting land along with BJP functionaries for their own benefit, contributing to the destruction of Goa’s precious green land.","The protest was held to draw attention to the defection two years ago when a group of legislators changed their allegiance and joined the ruling BJP.
