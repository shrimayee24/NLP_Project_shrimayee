NEW DELHI: The seat-sharing negotiations for upcoming assembly elections in Bihar have become more complex as two new parties - Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and Pashupati Paras's LJP faction - joined the Mahagathbandhan alliance. The situation is getting trickier as major parties are firm on their seat demands.The 243 seats will now be divided among eight parties -- Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress, CPI, CPM, VIP, LJP (Paras) and JMM.“Two more parties are expected to be part of the INDIA bloc soon and we all have to sacrifice our share of seats to accommodate the new partners.” State Congress president Rajesh Kumar told reporters after a discussion during a key meeting of INDIA bloc leaders at the official residence of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.Meanwhile, Congress insist that it cannot go below the 70 seats.VIP chief Mukesh Sahani, on the other hand, has demanded “60 seats plus the post of deputy CM” while the CPI-ML is pressing for at least 40 seats, pointing to its past performance.The RJD is also unwilling to contest on fewer than 150 seats.In 2020 assembly elections, Rashtriya Janata Dal had contested on 144 seats, of which it won 75.Congress won 19 out of 70 seats.CPI-ML contested 19 seats and won 12.CPM contested 4 seats and was successful in winning 2 seats.CPI contested on 6 seats and won 2 seats.RJD's Tejashwi Yadav has already declared himself as the CM face of the opposition INDIA bloc.Addressing the rally in Ara town, the last stopover of the 'Voter Adhikar Yatra', Tejashwi questioned the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar for ""frequently copying his ideas"" and described it as a ""copycat government"". Ridiculing the government for copying his ideas, he said that at present he was moving ahead while the govt was behind him.""Tejashwi aage-aage, Sarkar pichhe-pichhe.

‘Phulera-style governance in Delhi’: AAP hits out at Rekha Gupta; questions husband’s presence in official meetings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/phulera-style-governance-in-delhi-aap-hits-out-at-rekha-gupta-questions-husbands-presence-in-official-meetings/articleshow/123756059.cms,"Delhi CM Rekha Gupta with her husband Manish Gupta (Image: X/Saurabh_MLAgk)

Row Over Attack On Delhi CM Rekha Gupta, BJP Suspects Political Conspiracy By Rivals

NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday hit out at Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta, comparing her administration to the popular web series Panchayat. It alleged that the CM’s husband, Manish Gupta was being allowed to play an active role in government functioning.The party said the situation resembled the series, where the elected sarpanch serves largely as a figurehead while administrative work is handled by her husband.In a post on X, AAP questioned, “Is the government of Phulera's Panchayat currently running in Delhi?”AAP leader and former health minister Saurabh Bhardwaj also launched a scathing attack on Delhi CM.In a post on X, he said: ""Just as in Phulera's panchayat, where the woman sarpanch's husband acted as the sarpanch, today in Delhi, the CM's husband is sitting in official meetings.""Bhardwaj said the move was completely unconstitutional, adding that in the nation’s capital both democracy and the constitutional system were being mocked. He accused the BJP of indulging in the very dynastic politics for which it frequently criticises the Congress.“This is completely unconstitutional. In the nation’s capital, democracy and the constitutional system are being mocked. The BJP, which often attacks the Congress over dynastic politics, must answer whether this is not the same,” Bhardwaj wrote.He further questioned why a family member was being given such authority, asking: “Does the CM of the world’s largest party have no worker left whom she can trust? What is that work which only a family member can do?”The AAP leader asked what the reasons were for the chief minister to establish her husband’s authority. He further questioned why her husband was being made a part of the government’s administrative system in this way.He also posted photographs showing her husband seated beside the chief minister in official meetings.The criticism comes after photos of Manish Gupta attending official meetings appeared both on Rekha Gupta’s personal Instagram account and the official handle of the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO).The controversy has evoked comparisons with Panchayat, a web series by TVF on Amazon Prime set in the fictional village of Phulera, Uttar Pradesh.The show depicts Manju Devi (played by Neena Gupta) as the elected sarpanch, but it is her husband Brij Bhushan Dubey (played by Raghubir Yadav) who effectively handles all administrative responsibilities.","The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday hit out at Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta.

'Only Mistake I Made Was...': Prajwal Revanna Tells Court Before Life Sentence In Rape Case

Poll Do you think protests will effectively change the political situation in Punjab? Yes No

PATIALA: AAP MLA Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra has allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.According to Punjab Police sources, Pathanmajra and his accomplices fired at police officers during the escape and even ran over one personnel, leaving him injured.According to reports, Pathanmajra and his accomplices ran over police personnel with an SUV.The Sanour MLA was arrested a day after publicly criticising his party’s Delhi leadership.His detention in Patiala was linked to a rape case filed against him, sparking political uproar in the region.In a social media post, Pathanmajra claimed the case related to his former wife and alleged that the fresh charges of rape were politically motivated.“I was booked because I raised my voice against my own government, especially the Delhi leadership,” he wrote.His brother, Hardev Singh, said the MLA was taken into custody under Section 376 of the IPC despite already having been granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. “He was arrested from Dabri in Haryana in a case where bail was already granted. This is clearly an attempt to silence him,” he alleged.CIA Patiala confirmed that three weapons have been recovered and one accomplice of MLA Pathanmajra has been arrested.The arrested individual has been identified as Balwinder Singh, while the search for MLA Pathanmajra continues.Police said two officers were injured when stones were thrown at them during the MLA’s escape attempt.Authorities added that supporters of the MLA not only pelted stones but also opened fire at the police team.Before his arrest, Pathanmajra had appealed to colleagues and supporters via Facebook to protest outside the Patiala SSP’s office at the Mini Secretariat. He urged people to reach “in tractors, trolleys, and cars” to demand his release. “I will not be silenced even if more cases are registered against me. Will AAP’s Delhi leadership rule Punjabis now? Even Congress and BJP did not interfere to this extent,” he said.The MLA has repeatedly accused the party’s central leadership of sidelining Punjab leaders and “remote-controlling” the state. Recently, he criticised officials of the Irrigation Department over flood relief efforts in his constituency. Soon after, his security cover was withdrawn and police officers in the area were reshuffled — moves that raised eyebrows.“This is retaliation. They looted Punjab more than Abdali. Now they want to sell Punjab,” Pathanmajra declared.","Harmeet Singh Pathanmajra allegedly escaped police custody while being taken to a local police station after his arrest.

AMBALA: Haryana chief minister (CM) Nayab Singh Saini on Saturday inspected the waterlogged areas near Naggal village in Ambala district and interacted with the affected farmers. On his way from Chandigarh to Kaithal, the CM halted at Naggal and Hassanpur villages to review the situation and directed officials to ensure immediate drainage of rainwater.The CM was accompanied by former minister Aseem Goel, BJP district president Mandeep Rana, Ambala deputy commissioner (DC) Ajay Singh Tomar, and superintendent of police Ajit Singh Shekhawat.Briefing the CM, Goel explained that heavy inflow from the Tangri river and seasonal rainwater into the Naggal drain (locally known as Ganda Nala) had raised the water level significantly, affecting around 40 villages. DC Tomar informed that nearly 28,000 acres of land under Ambala City tehsil had been submerged.Goel suggested the construction of a siphon in the area to provide a permanent solution to the recurring waterlogging. Responding, CM Saini directed officials to prepare a detailed plan for siphon and drain construction to address the problem sustainably.Later, CM Saini interacted with representatives of Bharatiya Kisan Union, including Jai Singh Jalbera, and assured farmers of timely support.He instructed irrigation officials to operate pumps near Addo Majra dam to expedite water drainage. Officials explained that gravity was already aiding natural outflow and additional pumps were being deployed. Once the Tangri river level recedes, gates would be lifted to release more water.At Segti village near Jansui Head, CM Saini met farmers and highlighted that the government has opened the e-Kshati portal for damage registration. “Farmers can register their crop losses online, and compensation will be provided as per norms,” he assured.Several senior BJP leaders and district officials were present during the visit.","Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini inspected the waterlogged areas near Naggal village in Ambala district.
