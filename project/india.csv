BJP Hits Out at Tejashwi Yadav, Calls Rahul Gandhi PM Dreams Unrealist

NEW DELHI: Recently expelled from both his family and party in Bihar, Tej Pratap Yadav on Saturday made a striking anti-family remark while addressing a gathering in Jehanabad. During the event, when someone from the crowd shouted ""Abki Baar Tejashwi Sarkar,"" Tej Pratap reacted sharply.""Don’t talk nonsense here… Government is formed by people, not by an individual. Nobody should be egoistic about it. ‘Jo Ghamand Mein Rahega, Vo Jaldi Girega’,""he said.He added, ""Don’t fall for those who are trying to break the ‘Team Tej Pratap Yadav’. Someone tried to break me, but god gave me another chance. The one who can’t be loyal to their own people, what can they do for the citizens? I don't have the greed to be the CM.""Back in May, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad expelled his eldest son from both the family and the party for six years, citing disregard for moral values in personal life.""Ignoring moral values in personal life weakens our collective struggle for social justice. The actions, public conduct, and irresponsible behavior of my eldest son are not in accordance with our family’s principles. Therefore, under these circumstances, I am removing him from the party and the family. Effective immediately, he will have no role of any kind in either. He is expelled from the party for six years,"" Lalu had said.",Tej Pratap Yadav made the remark while addressing a gathering in Jehanabad.

Mahua Moitra Under Fire: TMC MP’s ‘Cut Amit Shah’s Head’ Jibe Draws Sharp BJP Backlash

NEW DELHI: TMC MP Mahua Moitra has lit a political powder keg with her explosive remark targeting Union home minister Amit Shah , allegedly saying his ""head should be cut off"". The BJP condemned the statement as a ""distasteful and hate remark,"" with the party lodging a complaint at Krishnanagar's Kotwali police station.While speaking on the issue of illegal immigration along India’s eastern border, Moitra, addressing in Bengali, reportedly said, ""Amit Shah’s head should be cut off and placed on the table.""However, there is no independent confirmation of the statement.Meanwhile, the BJP hit back at TMC MP over her statement, calling it ""distasteful and hate remarks"" and asking whether it represented the TMC's official position.Moitra, speaking to reporters in Nadia district during an event, accused the Union government of neglecting its responsibility on border security. ""They are repeatedly talking about infiltrators; but the border of India is protected by five forces, and that is directly the home ministry's responsibility,"" she said.She also referred to PM Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech. ""Standing at Red Fort, the PM himself said infiltrators are causing demographic changes.But even as he was saying this, his Home Minister was standing in the front row, smiling and clapping,"" she added.The BJP's West Bengal unit later amplified her comments on X, sharing Moitra's picture with the statement as its caption, while intensifying its attack on the TMC leader.Later in the day, TMC MP Moitra hit back at the BJP over the row surrounding her alleged remark on Union home minister Shah.In a post on X, she wrote, ""Modus operandi of BJP troll cell – pick one issue, give it to all resident twits (and an ‘a’ instead of an ‘i’ would be just as well) and make it ‘viral’ on social media. Today’s theme is Mahua Moitra’s Off With His Head metaphor. Long live my infamy, guys. Love it.""Defending Moitra, her TMC colleague Kunal Ghosh told PTI that the remark was symbolic. ""Mahua Moitra's comment has no physical implications, nor did she intend to attack Union home minister Amit Shah. She was trying to make a symbolic statement, which did not translate well,"" he said.Reflecting on TMC MP's comment, BJP's Pradeep Bhandari called it a language of ""urban naxals"", saying, ""This is the language of political urban naxals. Mahua Moitra, Rahul Gandhi and all Opposition leaders are trying to provoke violence in the minds of people through their words. This is their culture that they abuse the late mother of the Prime Minister...All of this makes it clear that their 'niti' and 'niyat' are not in the interest of the nation or the public. ""On TMC MP's remark, BJP spokesperson RP Singh said, ""Be it Mahua Moitra or Congress party - one party abuses PM's mother and the other party's leader says that Amit Shah should be beheaded. It shows their frustration. They know that they are going to lose Bihar and Bengal is next. So, such language is being used out of frustration.""","TMC MP Mahua Moitra reportedly said, ""Amit Shah’s head should be cut off and placed on the table"" There is no independent confirmation of the statement.

Jarange begins fast as 30k supporters bring traffic to a halt in south Mumbai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jarange-begins-fast-as-30k-supporters-bring-traffic-to-a-halt-in-south-mumbai/articleshow/123593377.cms,"Mumbai: The hunger strike launched by Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange at Azad Maidan, which brought Mumbai to a halt on Friday, is set to continue Saturday with the police extending permission for one more day. However, the largely peaceful protest is set to become more combative with Jarange accusing the govt of closing toilets and tea shops to deny food and water to activists food. He warned they will retaliate in equal measure and also attacked CM Fadnavis.""This is the final fight. Either the govt will kill me with bullets or I will die in the hunger strike,"" said Jarange, whose agitation which demands Kunbi (OBC) status for the Maratha community comes shortly before local body polls due this year. Around 30,000 Maratha protesters converged in the city in a show of strength. Govt did not send a delegation to meet Jarange. However, earlier in the day, Fadnavis said, ""We are supportive of the agitation because such agitations are a part of democracy. We are following court orders... A path has to emerge through talks."" The agitation will pit the Maratha community, said to number around 30% of the state's population, against OBCs who are much larger in number.While NCP, Congress and NCP (SP) have a large Maratha following, OBCs are mainly with BJP. OBC groups have already announced a counter-agitation and this polarisation could benefit BJP.","Police extend permission for one more day.

'Let's together fight larger battle': Why Kapil Sibal's advice may not stop Arvind Kejriwal from targeting Congress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lets-together-fight-larger-battle-why-kapil-sibals-advice-may-not-stop-arvind-kejriwal-from-targeting-congress/articleshow/123588172.cms,"Arvind Kejriwal, Kapil Sibal (C), Rahul Gandhi (R)

NEW DELHI: ""Stop the bickering. Let's together fight the larger battle!"" - Kapil Sibal 's advice to Arvind Kejriwal after the AAP convener's latest offensive against the Congress is unlikely to impress the former Delhi chief minister.Sibal, who served as Union minister in the UPA governments and is currently an Independent Rajya Sabha member, counselled Kejriwal after the AAP convener alleged a nexus between the BJP and the Congress and questioned why no ""big leader"" of the grand old party had been arrested in the National Herald case ""We keep on getting offers for a compromise. Now, even people are seeing that Congress has reached a compromise with the BJP. The National Herald case is an open and shut case. But no big leader of the Congress has gone to jail. Five of our big leaders were sent to jail in a fake case,"" Kejriwal said at a meeting of AAP MLAs and councillors in the national capital.Citing examples from Goa, the AAP supremo emphasised, ""People ask why the BJP has sent five of AAP's top leaders to jail but not a single Congress leader. They shout endlessly about the National Herald case, which I myself read about online.As per facts, it looks like an open-and-shut case. Yet despite serious allegations, no one from the Gandhi family has gone to jail, while we are jailed in completely fabricated cases. ""Kejriwal also made a mention of the land scam cases of Haryana and named Robert Vadra to highlight his point. ""In 2014 the BJP built its campaign around 'jija ji' (brother-in-law) and corruption, shouting about Vadra, 2G and coal scams. Yet today, all those cases have quietly been shut. The people are not fools. They can see the reality--that Congress and BJP are in a hidden alliance,"" he said.Kejriwal and several other AAP leaders were booked and arrested in the alleged liquor scam case and other cases. All the AAP leaders were eventually granted bail. However, Kejriwal resigned ahead of the assembly elections and made Atishi the chief minister of Delhi.Sibal, who has been associated with the grand old party for a long time, was quick to remind Kejriwal about the consequences of his baseless allegations against political rivals in the past.""Kejriwal ji: When you made allegations against several politicians and others and was dragged to court you apologised! Today you made baseless allegations against the Gandhi family (National Herald case). Stop the bickering. Let's together fight the larger battle!"" Sibal said in a post on X.But the question is: Will Kejriwal heed Sibal's advice? Well, it seems unlikely as the ties between the two parties nosedived during the last Delhi elections when Congress played a key role in the defeat of AAP at the hands of the BJP.While both Congress and AAP are part of the opposition's INDIA bloc, the two parties have all along shared uneasy ties - characterised by threats, warnings and blackmails. When INDIA bloc was formed, Kejriwal made AAP's participation conditional to Congress's support against the Centre's Delhi ordinance. The two parties did join hands in Delhi for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections after a lot of back and forth, but the experiment failed to stop the BJP from winning all the 7 Lok Sabha seats in the national capital for the third time in a row.In the assembly elections, the two allies turned into bitter rivals and went all out to discredit each other. With the Congress putting all its might against AAP, the BJP gained and managed to return to power in the national capital after a long gap of 27 years.In Haryana assembly elections, the two parties tried to stich an alliance but could not reach a common ground. In several other states like Gujarat, Goa, the AAP has successfully contested on its own and managed to spread its reach. Till they lost elections in Delhi, AAP was the only party besides BJP and Congress to have government in two states.The Congress, on the other hand, despite all its electoral reverses in the last 11 years, remains the only opposition party with pan-India presence and hence takes the position of principal challenger to the BJP.Any attempt to broker peace between AAP and Congress is unlikely to succeed as the two parties remain rivals in Punjab where assembly elections are due early in 2027. Both the parties have huge stakes in the state. In the last assembly elections in 2022, AAP had decimated the Congress and stormed to power winning 92 of the 117 assembly seats in the state.For AAP, Punjab remains the only state where it has government and hence led by Kejriwal the party will go out to retain the state. On the other hand, the Congress which has considerable presence in the state, will do everything possible to return to power.In the given scenario, it will be difficult for AAP and Congress to come together for the larger fight - the 2029 Lok Sabha elections, when the INDIA bloc will once again try to challenge the dominance of BJP-led NDA.","Sibal counselled Kejriwal after the AAP convener alleged a nexus between the BJP and the Congress. He questioned why no ""big leader"" of the grand old party had been arrested in the National Herald case. Sibal was quick to remind Kejriwal about the consequences of his baseless allegations against political rivals.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123588719,imgsize-1068114,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-24.jpg"
Karnataka School Baby Delivery: Class IX student delivers baby in school toilet; four suspended,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-schoolgirl-delivers-baby-in-school-toilet-staff-suspended-inquiry-ordered/articleshow/123574535.cms,"Poll Do you believe the school staff should face stricter penalties for failing to monitor the student? Yes No





YADGIR: A class 9 girl of a govt residential school delivered a baby boy in the institution’s restroom in Shahapur taluk of the district on Wednesday evening in a case of shocking lapses by the school & hostel staff.Karnataka Educational Institutions Society executive director Kantharaju suspended the school principal, hostel warden, science teacher and physical teacher on charges of dereliction of duty.According to district police, the 17-year-old girl delivered the baby after completing the full term, and none of the staffers noticed any behavioural changes in the student.The action follows a complaint from district child protection officer Nirmala with Shahapur police station. Shahapur in North Karnataka is 550km from Bengaluru.Deputy commissioner Harshal Bhoyar termed the incident ""unfortunate"" and said the school failed to report the incident to the district administration. ""The case is being investigated from different angles, including child marriage,"" he said and refused to give further details, calling it a sensitive case. Shashidhar Kosmbe, member of Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, told TOI the school staff kept ""the shocking incident a secret"" and they failed to perform their duties.According to rules, a staff nurse should conduct monthly health and menstrual checks on girl students of the hostel and make note of any health issues or behavioural changes in them. ""No such efforts were made in the school to curb this incident. We are really wondering why school staff members didn't bother about the girl's condition until she gave birth in the restroom,"" he said, adding the mother and her child are healthy and have been shifted to a govt hospital.The commission has instructed the district child protection officer to submit a thorough report on the incident. ""We've spoken to the SP to file an FIR after receiving a complaint from the district child protection officer. The commission has already filed a suo motu case against the school authority. The deputy director of district social welfare has been directed to take disciplinary action against the school staff,"" he added.","The 17-year-old girl delivered the baby after completing the full term.

Mys MP: Chamundi Hill belongs to Hindus





BENGALURU: Under fire from BJP over his remark that Chamundi Hill in Mysuru ""does not belong to Hindus alone"", Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar Thursday said he would rather ""remain mum"" and let others in the party speak as every statement of his is held to scrutiny and shredded by opposition leaders.Just two days after his clarification on singing the RSS anthem in the legislative assembly, Shivakumar again found himself in a cleft stick, this time on the Chamundi Hill comment.A fresh row began after Shivakumar defended the govt's decision to invite writer Banu Mushtaq to inaugurate Mysuru Dasara atop Chamundi Hill on Sept 22. His statement that the hill did not belong to Hindus alone invited criticism from BJP, which accused Congress of insulting Hindu faith and announced protests.Party national general secretary BL Santhosh linked Shivakumar's troubles to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, recalling the deputy CM's apology for singing the RSS anthem. tnnLet that sink in ...@INCIndia under @RahulGandhi will never tolerate anything concerned with nationalism. They want everyone who's with them to oppose anything that is nationalist,"" Santhosh wrote on X.Pramoda Devi Wadiyar said in a statement: ""The choice of (Banu Mushtaq) has given rise to conflicting opinions.While defending the decisions, insensitive statements such as - Chamundeshwari temple does not belong to Hindus - were both unnecessary and avoidable.... If it were not a Hindu temple, it would never have been brought under the Muzrai department.""Mysuru MP Yaduveer said Chamundi Hill belongs to Hindus and it is the property of Hindus. ""The deputy CM's statement cannot change it,"" he said, calling it condemnable.The choice of Mushtaq has become contentious after an old video resurfaced in which she expressed reservations about worshipping Kannada as 'Goddess Bhuvaneshwari', saying it was exclusionary. BJP leaders, including state president B.Y. Vijayendra, demanded she clarify her stand. Mushtaq claimed her remarks had been distorted and taken out of context.Janata Dal (Secular) youth wing president Nikhil Kumaraswamy added, ""We have no issues that a Muslim dignitary will be inaugurating the Dasara festival... There are many other great achievers. You (the state govt) could have considered other options as well."""," DK Shivakumar under fire from BJP over his remark that Chamundi Hill in Mysuru ""does not belong to Hindus alone"" He said he would rather ""remain mum"" and let others in the party speak as every statement of his is held to scrutiny.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123576377,imgsize-1345291,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/dk-shivakumar-in-the-eye-of-storm-again-chamundi-hill-remark-sparks-bjp-fury.jpg"
