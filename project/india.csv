"Tihar to Parliament, Baramulla MP Rashid engineers a new identity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tihar-to-parliament-baramulla-mp-rashid-engineers-a-new-identity/articleshow/111522790.cms,"Rap icon

Eminem

famously sang, ""Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?"", when his fictional alter ego seemed burdened by the weight of an image defined in the public imagination.

The persona of Sheikh Abdul Rashid , aka Engineer Rashid, stands at the cusp of a similar identity conundrum.So, who is this 1967-born Kashmiri incarcerated at Tihar since 2019 in a terrorist-funding case, who went head-to-head with Omar Abdullah and Sajad Lone in an election in J&K's Baramulla , and polled more votes than the two of them combined?Rashid's story begins at Mawar village in Langate tehsil of Kupwara at a time when Pakistan-backed terrorism was still to inflict wounds that would fester.As a teenager growing up in the 70s, Rashid was drawn towards the separatist sentiments brewing in his neighbourhood and beyond.He wouldn't have known then of the turmoil that would tear J&K asunder in the decades to come. But it was those early impressions that drove the trajectory of a life and career shaped by strong political convictions, marred by controversies, and riddled with ironies.Along the way, Rashid got a BSc degree in 1988 and, subsequently, a civil engineering diploma that helped him land a job in the state-owned Jammu and Kashmir Projects Construction Corporation.When he transitioned from construction sites to the political arena full-time in 2008, the epithet ""Engineer"" became Rashid's first name. That very year, he won an election for the first time as an Independent candidate for north Kashmir's Langate assembly seat.""I am the most misunderstood MLA in India,"" Rashid was quoted as saying on October 20, 2015, a day after he had his face sprayed with ink by intruders at Press Club of India in Delhi.Earlier that month, he had been slapped inside the J&K assembly for hosting an alleged ""beef party"" at a govt guesthouse. Rashid was then in his second term as MLA of Langate and laying the building blocks for his fledgling Awami Ittehad Party.In the public eye, Rashid often sought to debunk perceptions of the ideology his politics was anchored to. He would question why the media portrayed him as ""a secessionist masquerading as an MLA"" while separatists in J&K purportedly disliked him for ""embracing the Constitution"".Between these twin images at either end of the perception periscope possibly lies Rashid's truth.The newly elected Baramulla MP cut his teeth in politics when he joined slain separatist Abdul Gani Lone's J&K People's Conference in 1979. He went on to contest the Langate seat on a Muslim United Front ticket in 1987, making an unremarkable debut in an election that opponents of the then CM, National Conference's Farooq Abdullah, said was stage-managed.Rashid's first brush with the law came in 2005, when the Special Operations Group of J&K Police arrested and charged him with supporting terrorists. He was jailed under the Public Safety Act for three months and 17 days.Before his arrest by NIA in the ongoing case under UAPA, 2019 had been a windsock in some ways for Rashid as a politician. He unsuccessfully contested the Baramulla Lok Sabha seat that year as an Independent, but fetching over a lakh votes and finishing only 800-odd behind People Conference's Sajad Lone showed him where he stood.This time, contesting as an Awami Ittehad Party candidate with a call to ""progress, prestige and protection"", Rashid left it to his sons Abrar Rashid and Asrar Rashid to drive an emotive campaign that swept away Sajad Lone — the son of his former mentor — and former ex-CM Omar of National Conference as well as the other 19 candidates in the fray.","Sheikh Abdul Rashid is a 1967-born Kashmiri born in Mawar village in Langate tehsil of Kupwara. As a teenager growing up in the 70s, Rashid was drawn towards the separatist sentiments brewing in his neighbourhood. In 2008, he won an election for the first time as an Independent candidate for north Kashmir's Langate assembly seat.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111522818,imgsize-32840,width-400,resizemode-4/111522818.jpg"
"While opposition demands caste census, BJP ally Naidu opts for skill census",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/while-opposition-demands-caste-census-bjp-ally-naidu-opts-for-skill-census/articleshow/111525484.cms,"NEW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu is starting a skill census in the state and will suggest a similar exercise to PM Narendra Modi to map the skill sets available with the population and develop human capital.Unlike INDIA bloc states that have been pushing for a caste census, Naidu said the move is meant to expand the PPP into ""public, private, people's partnership"" to generate better results for citizens.Skilling and creating jobs are seen as a key focus for the Modi govt with some measures expected in the Union Budget.After a series of meetings in the capital, the TDP chief, a key ally of the BJP-led coalition at the Centre, said that development of Andhra Pradesh was his top priority after the Jagan Mohan Reddy govt left the state in severe financial stress. Naidu intends to highlight the strain and the absence of development, which has seen disruption of the Polavaran irrigation project and his plans to build Amaravati as the new state capital, through a series of five white papers.Naidu said he will let people decide what is to be done. He is also looking to use his earlier experience to put Andhra back on the development path and rope in investors, both domestic and foreign. Apart from Union ministers, the Andhra CM also met several industry leaders and acknowledged that there were concerns over the political climate in case there was a change of guard in the state. ""They are concerned about the devil. We are assuring them that we will control it,"" Naidu said. He also insisted that his party is not demanding any seats or a common agenda as BJP and the alliance partners have released their own manifestos.""We did not ask for any ministerial post from the Centre, not even during Vajpayee's time. Whatever was offered, we accepted,"" he said and recalled accepting Lok Sabha Speaker's post during the Vajpayee era ""only to"" maintain good relations with the alliance.""The party's priority is rebuilding Andhra Pradesh, which has suffered irreparable loss in the last five years. Our aim is to rebuild the state in the next five years. The people of Andhra Pradesh have given mandate to NDA. We will work together,"" he added.On quotas for minorities, an issue that Modi flagged as a concern during the general elections, Naidu said his party had used economic backwardness, not other considerations, for giving reservation.","Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu is starting a skill census in the state.

Mahua seeks FIR against Rekha Sharma



'Manifestations of depraved mindset'

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra has once again stoked controversy with her ""pajamas"" remark on Rekha Sharma, the chairperson of the National Commission for Women (NCW). The commission has reacted strongly to the TMC leader's ""derogatory, crude"" remarks and sought strict action against her. However, undeterred by NCW's FIR threat, the Trinamool MP dug up old remarks of Rekha Sharma and called her a ""serial offender"".On July 4, NCW chief Rekha Sharma went to Hathras to meet the women who were injured in the tragic stampede that claimed 121 lives. Videos showed the NCW chief at the stampede site with someone holding an umbrella for her.Reacting to the video, several users on social media wondered why the NCW chief could not hold the umbrella herself. Mahua Moitra reacted to one such post and took potshots at the NCW chief. ""She’s too busy holding up her boss's pajamas,"" the Trinamool MP wrote attacking Rekha Sharma, who is often accused by opposition parties of working for and at the behest of the BJP-led NDA government.Mahua Moitra's snide remarks evoked strong reaction from Rekha Sharma, who called the TMC MP a ""troll"". ""She is not interested in her work but just trolling people, and I don't give my time to trollers,"" the NCW chief said attacking Mahua Moitra. Rekha Sharma also clarified about the incident and said she was not inside the umbrella. ""I didn't ask for it nor did I realised that someone is carrying umbrella as there was so much rush & I was engrossed in the situation & talking to people,"" the NCW chief said in a post.Sharma also wrote letters to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Delhi Police Commissioner Sanjay Arora over Moitra's remark.The National Commission for Women later took suo moto cognizance of Mahua Moitra's derogatory remarks and sought an FIR against the Trinamool MP.""The National Commission for Women has taken suo moto cognizance of the derogatory remark made by Ms. Mahua Moitra, Member of Parliament, against Ms. Rekha Sharma, Chairperson, NCW.

NCW strongly condemns these defamatory remarks and requests strict action against Ms. Moitra. An FIR should be registered against Ms. Moitra and a detailed action report should be communicated to the Commission within 3 days,"" the NCW said in a post tagging Delhi Police.However, the Trinamool leader remained defiant and undeterred by NCW's FIR threat and launched a counter attack. She dared the Delhi Police to come to Nadia in West Bengal and arrest her.""Come on @DelhiPolice please take action immediately on these suo moto orders. Am in Nadia in case you need me in the next 3 days to make a quick arrest. I Can Hold My Own Umbrella,"" Mahua wrote on X, responding to NCW's tweet on her remarks.Later in a post on X, Moitra shared several screenshots of Rekha Sharma's old remarks against various leaders like Arvind Kejriwal, Sonia Gandhi and Lalu Prasad. She called Rekha Sharma a ""serial offender"" and sought an FIR.In reply to Moitra's 'I can hold my own umbrella' tweet, Sharma put out a photo of the TMC MP with a person holding an umbrella for her. ""See she can hold her own umbrella so nicely,"" she wrote.The BJP, meanwhile, reacted strongly to Mahua's attack on the NCW chief. BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla called the TMC leader's remarks disgusting and demanded that she should be sacked. ""MP Mahua Moitra who justified & remained silent during Sandeshkhali, Chopra Talibani flogging , silent on Swati Maliwal now makes a disgusting comment at another women that too the NCW Chief!

Will Mamata Didi act on her ? Nope ?? just like they remained silent on Sandeshkhali & Chopra,"" Poonawalla said.BJP leader Amit Malviya called it an example of the Trinamool leader's ""depraved mindset."" He also questioned if Mahua Moitra was speaking from her own experience. ""Mamata Banerjee’s MP keeps it classy. Not sure if it is an acquired insight or lived.

He was arrested from Rode, the village of Khalistani leader Jarnail SinghBhindranwale .Barely nine months before his arrest, after his return from Dubai in Aug 2022, Amritpal got formally baptised at Anandpur Sahib to become an Amritdhari Sikh (pure Sikh).

Some even started calling him Bhindranwale 2.0.Even his 'dastar bandi' (turban-tying ceremony to bestow responsibility) in Sept 2022 was held at Bhindranwale's village.

"JUH seeks Muslim quota, opposes UCC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/juh-seeks-muslim-quota-opposes-ucc/articleshow/111521043.cms,"NEW DELHI: Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind ended its two-day governing council meeting on Friday with a call for Muslim quota based on social, economic and educational backwardness, and reiterated its opposition to Uniform Civil Code (UCC).In a resolution, JUH said “reservation should not be based on religion, nor should it be hindered by religious considerations”, while highlighting that the Constitution provides for reservation for disadvantaged classes deprived of adequate representation.It said Other Backward Classes ( OBC ) at both central and state levels included many Muslim communities and the quota was based on social and educational backwardness. “The 4% sub-quota reserved for Muslim OBCs in Karnataka, as well as quotas in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, adhere to constitutional rights . The meeting urges other state governments to adopt this commendable practice without succumbing to political pressures,” the resolution said.The demand comes in the backdrop of ‘quota’ featuring prominently in the Lok Sabha polls with BJP and Congress targeting each other over quota-related issues.Jamiat’s resolution demanded that Dalits among Muslims be treated at par with Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist Scheduled Castes. “If a Hindu converts to Christianity or Islam, they forfeit their benefits under Section 341. This exemplifies severe religious discrimination ,” JUH claimed and demanded that the govt amend the Constitution to eliminate such religious restrictions.In another resolution, JUH reiterated its opposition to UCC and called it ""part of a broader conspiracy to undermine the religious freedom and constitutional rights of citizens"". Calling implementation of UCC by the Uttarakhand government as “arbitrary and unjust”, it urged the Centre not to proceed with any proposal for UCC.On Thursday, JUH had passed a resolution against “growing hate campaign” and called for a separate legislation to counter Islamophobia by punishing those who incite violence. JUH president Maulana Mahmood Madani had said, “The country cannot thrive on hatred.”The Jamiat also condemned the attempt by central and state govts to “saffronise” the education system and compel students to engage in practices that contradict their religious beliefs. Stating that the “govt’s imposition of compulsory orders for school students to perform surya namaskar, Saraswati puja, Hindu songs, shlokas, or wear tilak is an interference in religious freedom”, JUH appealed to the govt to refrain from such provocative actions.The governing council meeting was attended by nearly 1,500 members and prominent Islamic clerics and scholars from across the country.","Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind calls for Muslim quota based on social, economic and educational backwardness.

I am a Hindu but don’t follow Sanatan tradition (also known as Sanatana Dharma ) instead I believe in Arya Samaj tradition (Arya Samaj tradition is a more reformist and progressive approach to Hinduism, which emphasizes the authority of the Vedas but rejects the caste system and other social hierarchies). Being a Hindu is a personal matter,” he added.Birender Singh who left BJP prior to lok sabha election along with his former Hisar BJP MP Brijendra Singh and joined Congress claimed that the NDA-led coalition government will not complete its tenure and collapse within two years. This is not a stable government that will not complete five years following its ally partners’ demands and other reasons, he added.Singh held a meeting of his workers in a private hotel near Safidon bypass of Jind city, asking them to start preparation for assembly elections scheduled in October. He made a strategy to field more and more supporters from Congress party in Jind, Hisar, Kaithal and nearby districts. He announced the formation of a three-member committee of close aids to prepare a roadmap for the elections.
