MumbaiBombay high court has directed Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central to immediately discharge an 18-year-old woman and her newborn child after it refused to discharge them without the filing of a police complaint since she had conceived when she was a minor .Justices Burgess Colabawalla and Somasekhar Sundaresan Friday allowed a petition by the woman’s mother. “Considering an FIR has already been filed, we see no impediment in directing Nair Hospital in discharging the petitioner’s daughter, along with her child,” they stated.They passed the order noting the “rather peculiar” facts of the case. The daughter attained age of majority on Aug 18. She was in a “voluntary” relationship with her friend. They developed physical intimacy and she became pregnant. At that time, she was 17 years and a few months old.During a check-up at Nair Hospital, it was noticed that the girl was a minor when she conceived. The hospital forwarded her details to the police station as it was a Pocso case. She delivered on Oct 11.Since she desired to surrender her child for adoption, the hospital was not discharging her without a police complaint being filed. Hence, her mother moved HC to direct her discharge and to direct the Child Welfare Committee to proceed with the adoption process without insisting on an FIR.At the in-chambers hearing, the judges were informed by govt pleader Poornima Kantharia of the FIR against the daughter’s boyfriend. The mother’s advocates said it was filed based on her initial statement during her daughter’s admission to the hospital. The mother told the judges that as the relationship between her daughter and her boyfriend was consensual, they do not want to prosecute him.The judges disposed of the plea directing that “petitioner’s daughter and her child shall, along with the police, immediately produce themselves before the Child Welfare Committee… for surrendering the child for adoption.”",Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central refused to discharge 18-year-old woman and her newborn child without the filing of a police complaint since she had conceived when she was a minor.

Court bins Maharashtra mantri’s plea to drop PMLA case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/court-bins-maharashtra-mantris-plea-to-drop-pmla-case/articleshow/114635601.cms,"NEW DELHI:

In a setback to Ajit-Pawar led NCP and a judgment that can have bearing on other PMLA cases, a special court in Mumbai on Friday rejected a plea of NCP heavyweight and Maharashtra cabinet minister Chhagan Bhujbal that money laundering case against him and other associates be dropped. The minister unsuccessfully argued that ACB FIR (scheduled offence), a prerequisite for a PMLA case , has been quashed.The probe against Bhujbal, his son Pankaj, nephew Sameer and other associates was first initiated by ACB, Maharashtra on directions of Bombay HC. After an initial inquiry, ACB registered an FIR in June 2015. This was the basis for ED to register an investigation under PMLA.However, ACB later dropped charges against accused Bhujbals. Encouraged by their acquittal by ACB, the accused moved special court seeking PMLA case against them to be dropped, too, since it requires existence of a scheduled offence. The PMLA special court, however, rejected their contention, distinguishing between schedule offence and the one under PMLA while observing that “facts emerging therefrom, even on taking them at their face value, disclose the existence of ingredients constituting the alleged offence”.ED had completed its probe and filed a chargesheet back in 2016. The special court took cognisance of the chargesheet, prima facie validating the ED findings and allowing charges to be framed against the accused.The probe linked ‘proceeds of crime’ of Rs 280 crore, received by one of the alleged associates of Bhujbal, as kickbacks generated in lieu of the works awarded without tender for construction of Maharashtra Sadan in Delhi and RTO office in Andheri. Bhujbal was then PWD minister in Maharashtra govt and responsible for award of the work. ED during its investigation had arrested Bhujbal and others and attached assets of the accused worth Rs 433 crore.","The probe against Bhujbal, his son Pankaj, nephew Sameer and other associates was first initiated by ACB, Maharashtra on directions of Bombay HC.

The results will be declared on November 23, along with Maharashtra.In the Tribal-dominated state, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and CM Hemant's Soren Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) are in a direct fight, while the Congress party and Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are in alliance with the JMM.The JMM-Congress-RJD alliance are also reportedly seeking to deal with Left parties, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party and other tribal outfits that have been contesting the elections in the state as independent entities and make efforts to field candidates against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on all 81 seats collectively.In the last assembly polls in 2019, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance won a comfortable majority of 47 seats in a House of 81.The BJP slipped to 25 seats from 37 it held in 2014. The poor performance was perceived to be the outcome of its decision to contest alone backfiring. The party did not foster an alliance with the Ajsu in the 2019 polls when Raghubar Das, currently the Odisha governor, was serving the state as CM.In this year's Lok Sabha polls in Jharkhand, the BJP-led NDA secured nine out of the 14 seats, with the BJP winning eight and its alliance partner, the Ajsu (All Jharkhand Students Union) Party, retaining its single seat.On the other hand, the opposition India bloc improved its tally, increasing its seat count from two in 2019 to five in the parliamentary polls.BJP and JMM have spruced up their pace of campaigning from the ground zero to social media. BJP and JMM leaders are actively rebutting and challenging each other on a range of issues, including illegal immigration, youth welfare, employment and housing.INDIA bloc parties in Jharkhand slammed the EC for holding assembly elections in the state along with that of Maharashtra but claimed that they were ready to slug it out with BJP-led NDA, which has welcomed the announcement of poll dates.JMM, Congress, and CPI (ML-L) said the announcement showed that EC was in a hurry to conduct elections though the assembly tenure was due to end in January next year.Also, both the INDIA bloc and BJP-led NDA are expected to get into huddles to discuss the modalities of seat-sharing which is going to be a challenge for both the competing teams.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday announced dates for the Jharkhand assembly elections, which will be held on November 13 and 20 in two phases.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra. Elections in Maharashtra will be held in single phase on November 20. The counting of votes will be on November 23.Maharashtra is gearing up for elections as the two major political alliances—the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Mahayuti—prepare to face each other for the first time in a Vidhan Sabha election.The Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprise of the Congress, the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, will go head-to-head with the Mahayuti , which includes the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Shiv Sena faction led by Eknath Shinde, and the NCP faction led by Ajit Pawar. This will be the first electoral contest between these two alliances since the splits within the Shiv Sena and NCP.The MVA is hopeful of replicating its recent Lok Sabha success, while the Mahayuti aims to retain power by leveraging its populist schemes targeted at women and youth. Both alliances have set their sights on winning the state.Narayan Rane, a former Union Minister and the victor in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg Lok Sabha constituency, is poised to be a key figure for the BJP in the Konkan region during the forthcoming elections. Meanwhile, two constituencies are expected to be critical battlegrounds: chief minister Eknath Shinde's Kopri-Pachpakdi seat in Thane City and Worli in Mumbai, where Aaditya Thackeray, a leader of the Shiv Sena (UBT), is seeking reelection.In the last Vidhan Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP secured 26.1% of the votes, the Congress 16.1%, the NCP 16.9%, and the Shiv Sena 16.6%. The BJP and the Shiv Sena (then united) formed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured a majority. However, the coalition soon crumbled due to disagreements over government formation, plunging the state into a political crisis.After no party could establish a government, Maharashtra was placed under President's rule. Devendra Fadnavis was briefly sworn in as chief minister, with Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister. However, both resigned just days later before a scheduled floor test.By November 28, 2019, a new coalition emerged, with the Shiv Sena (Uddhav faction), NCP (Sharad Pawar faction), and Congress forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, led by Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister.The state's politics took another turn in June, 2022, when Uddhav Thackeray resigned following a rebellion within the Shiv Sena, led by Eknath Shinde, who then allied with the BJP. Eknath Shinde assumed the role of chief minister, with Devendra Fadnavis returning as deputy chief minister.",The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the assembly election dates for the state of Maharashtra.

MUMBAI: The Bombay High Court directed the Director General of Police (DGP) to appoint an officer from the State CID, of Deputy Commissioner or of equal rank, to probe a Dec 2018 complaint to the then Thane Police Commissioner by an accused in a cheating case.The complaint stated that he supplied electronic goods procured from a businessman to Kasarvadavali police station and also to a police officer, but was not paid for them.""The allegations in the complaint are quite serious. First of all, it is hard to understand how the police officers from a particular police station can take such expensive articles from a private party without following due procedure. Secondly, if the allegations are true, some serious action needs to be taken,"" said Justices Sarang Kotwal and Neela Gokhale in Wednesday's order.They quashed the Dec 20, 2018, FIR and trial pending before a Magistrate Court against Nainesh Panchal with the consent of complainant Mohammad Khan . The FIR stated Khan has an electronics showroom in Bhiwandi. Panchal, claiming to have a shop, took delivery of 14 air-conditioners to sell for a commission, but did not pay Khan. He gave excuses and his cheques were dishonoured, causing Khan a Rs 4.2 lakh loss. Thereafter, both settled the matter.Panchal moved HC to quash the FIR. ""The dispute between the parties is purely personal and commercial in nature. Therefore, we are inclined to allow this petition,"" the judges said. The judges then took note of ""a disturbing feature in this case. They referred to the Dec 20, 2018 complaint written by Panchal to the CP that he supplied air-conditioners, water coolers, a computer, LED TV, printer, etc., to the police station worth over Rs 6 lakh, but was only paid Rs 4.2 lakh.Police inspector (Crime) Nasir Kulkarni purchased over Rs 11 lakh worth of electronic items for his office and home, but paid him only Rs 2 lakh. He was not given his money despite asking for it. In fact, when Panchal went to the police station in his friend's car, Kulkarni forcefully took the car to his place and parked it in his building premises. Panchal's advocate Sachin Thorat said as a counterblast to the Dec 20, 2018 complaint, the FIR was filed three days later on Dec 23, 2018. Panchal told the judges nothing came out of his complaint to the CP.Thereafter, though electronic items from the police station were returned, he suffered heavy losses, resulting in his default in paying Khan. The judges directed the appointed officer to conduct an inquiry expeditiously and within three months and submit a report. They posted the matter for compliance and further consideration on Feb 5.",Bombay High Court orders DGP to appoint State CID officer to probe cheating case complaint.

Internal reservation

BENGALURU: The Nov 13 bypolls are likely to influence the state cabinet’s agenda, with contentious issues such as the caste census and internal reservation expected to be put on hold at Monday’s meeting.Chief minister Siddaramaiah had recently said the cabinet will discuss the socioeconomic and educational survey — commonly called the caste census — but officials from the chief minister’s office indicate topics such as this may not be on the table. Instead, the cabinet is likely to focus on setting the schedule for the winter session of the legislature which is expected to begin Nov 9 in Belagavi .“The code of conduct is in force and the govt cannot take any decision until Nov 23 when results of the bypolls will be announced,” said BR Patil, senior Congress MLA and political adviser to the CM. “The govt will address these issues after the polls.” Siddaramaiah has communicated this timeline to representatives of caste groups, including those pressing for 2A category reservation.Siddaramaiah’s commitment to publishing the caste census report has led to divisions within Congress. While representatives of Other Back ward Classes (OBCs) are pressing for swift action on the census — even submitting a memorandum to the CM last Thursday — politically dominant communities such as Lingayats and Vokkaligas have expressed opposition.At a meeting earlier this week, the Akhila Bharatha LingayatVeerashaiva Mahasabha resolved to oppose the report. “While the Lingayat-Veerashaiva community is not against a caste census, the contention is that this survey was conducted in an unscientific and unconstitutional manner,” said Eshwar Khandre, senior minister in Siddaramaiah’s cabinet and secretary general of the Akhila Bharatha Lingayat-Veerashaiva Mahasabha. “It would be better to conduct a survey afresh or wait for the Centre’s census, which is expected to include the caste factor.”Congress is also divided over internal reservation. While some functionaries and ministers representing the Left sect of Dalits advocate for its introduction, others from the Right sector are advising caution, opposing the removal of the creamy layer from reservation policies.“The previous BJP govt created this confusion around internal reservation by altering the Sadashiva Commission report and restricting the reservation pattern, although it was the prerogative of the Centre to do so,” said Priyank Kharge , IT-BT Minister and govt spokesperson. “Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has indicated that states can provide internal reservations based on empirical data. We will implement internal reservation as part of our promise in the Chitradurga Declaration.”He went on to say, “We want to implement the Supreme Court’s order, but we should await clarity from the Centre on empirical data or wait for the Centre’s census, which is expected to incorporate the caste factor.”",The cabinet is likely to focus on setting the schedule for the winter session of the legislature which is expected to begin Nov 9. The code of conduct is in force and the govt cannot take any decision until Nov 23 when results of the bypolls will be announced.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114641911,imgsize-53168,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/114641911.jpg"
