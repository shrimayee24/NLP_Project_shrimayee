BJP's legislative party to meet on February 19: Who will be Delhi's next CM?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjps-legislative-party-to-meet-tomorrow-who-will-be-delhis-next-cm/articleshow/118305518.cms,"NEW DELHI: After a historic victory in the Delhi Assembly elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is now gearing up for a major decision: who will become the next chief minister of Delhi? The party secured a commanding 48 seats out of 70, sweeping the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) aside and ending its decade-long rule in the capital.BJP Legislature Party meeting scheduled for tomorrow, February 17, was postponed. Now this meeting will be held on February 19. The swearing-in ceremony of the chief minister will also be held on 20th February instead of 18th February, ANI reported quoting sources.BJP's return to power in Delhi after 27 years has raised anticipation over the leadership choice. While several names have been floated, sources suggest the party is likely to select a leader from among the winning MLAs to avoid the necessity of byelections.Parvesh Verma has emerged as a strong contender following his victory over Arvind Kejriwal in the New Delhi constituency. The son of former chief minister Saheb Singh Verma, Parvesh has twice won the West Delhi Lok Sabha seat and is seen as a strong representative of the Jat community, which played a crucial role in the BJP's electoral success.Also read: Delhi CM likely to be an MLA; Parvesh Verma, Vijender Gupta in race Vijender Gupta, the leader of the BJP in the outgoing Assembly, is also being considered. Gupta secured his third consecutive victory from Rohini and is seen as an experienced leader capable of leading the state government. Additionally, former Delhi BJP chiefs Satish Upadhyay and Virendra Sachdeva have been named as potential choices.The BJP has a history of making unexpected choices for key leadership roles, often selecting lesser-known figures to introduce fresh perspectives. This has fuelled speculation that the party might opt for an unconventional pick. Some reports suggest the possibility of appointing two deputy chief ministers, a strategy previously used in states like uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh to ensure broad community representation.Another name gaining traction is Bansuri Swaraj, the daughter of the late Sushma Swaraj. A prominent lawyer, she has been actively involved in BJP's campaign efforts and secured a victory in the New Delhi constituency during the Lok Sabha elections.Harish Khurana, son of former chief minister Madan Lal Khurana, is also in the running after securing a decisive win against AAP's Shiv Charan Goel. Like Parvesh Verma, he carries strong political lineage and has been a dedicated party worker for years.The recent election results marked a major setback for AAP, which had ruled Delhi for a decade. The BJP secured a two-thirds majority, winning 48 out of 70 seats, while AAP managed to win only 22. Arvind Kejriwal’s defeat in the New Delhi constituency by Parvesh Verma symbolised the party’s declining fortune, with key AAP leaders, including Manish Sisodia and Satyendar Jain, also losing their seats.","BJP's return to power in Delhi after 27 years has raised anticipation over the leadership choice.

smear campaign

, vows legal step

GUWAHATI/NEW DELHI: The row over alleged Pakistani links of Gaurav Gogoi 's wife escalated on Sunday with the Congress MP saying he would initiate legal proceedings in the matter and Assam govt asking state police to register a case against Ali Tauqeer Sheikh , an advisor of the Pakistan Planning Commission , for his alleged attempts to interfere in domestic matters of the state.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma had earlier said a police case was likely to be registered to probe the allegations of Pakistani links of Gogoi's wife Elizabeth Colburn, who is a British national, but the cabinet on Sunday refrained from ordering a case against her.Apart from his engagement with the Pakistani govt, Sheikh also founded Lead Pakistan, a non-profit organisation working on climate change, Sarma said, claiming that Elizabeth was an integral part of Lead Pakistan during her time in Islamabad. tnnIn recent days, multiple news reports, social media posts, and other information in the public domain have surfaced regarding certain comments made by Pakistani national Ali Tauqeer Sheikh aimed at disrupting communal harmony in Assam,"" Himanta Biswa Sarma told the media.He added that a perusal of his social media activity included exhaustive commentary on India's internal affairs and parliamentary matters, raising serious concerns about Sheikh's intention to compromise and damage India's interests.Responding to BJP's allegations, Congress's Jairam Ramesh said, "" Assam CM and BJP have begun an atrocious smear campaign targeting my colleague Gaurav Gogoi. This is character assassination of the worst type. Legal action is being initiated right away.""Ramesh alleged that the smear campaign was because Gogoi won the Jorhat Lok Sabha seat in 2024 in spite of the Assam chief minister and other ministers camping in Jorhat and campaigning against him. ""It is also because the Jorhat MP has been in the forefront, revealing the blatant corruption and black deeds of the Assam CM,"" he added.Sarma has been targeting Gogoi over the past few days and alleged that the former had ISI links. He has accused Gogoi of ""leading young individuals to the Pakistan embassy for brainwashing and radicalisation"", and also questioned his wife's refusal to take Indian citizenship for the past 12 years.He also alleged that Gogoi had raised questions in Parliament on sensitive defence matters after his marriage with the British citizen, a charge termed by the opposition leader as ""false accusation"".",Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma had earlier said a police case was likely to be registered to probe the allegations of Pakistani links of Gaurav Gogoi's wife Elizabeth Colburn.

Instead of endangering their lives through illegal migration, they should contribute to Punjab's progress,"" he said. Mann claimed Punjab is experiencing ""reverse migration"", with youth returning from abroad for govt jobs. He said over 50,000 govt positions have been provided on merit in the past three years.Punjab BJP vice-president and ex-MLA Arvind Khanna blamed AAP govt's policies and linked the deportations to broader issues in Punjab, such as unemployment and drugs.SAD functionary Bikram Singh Majithia swiped at Mann, accusing him of ""playing to the gallery"" and indulging in ""dirty politics"" when US authorities are forcing Sikh youth to return without their turbans.
