Don't allow BJP's plans to succeed: Omar on bail to Engineer Rashid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-allow-bjps-plans-to-succeed-omar-on-bail-to-engineer-rashid/articleshow/113239229.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: A special NIA court in New Delhi on Tuesday granted interim bail to Baramulla MP Sheikh Abdul Rashid, better known as Engineer Rashid (pic), till Oct 2, allowing him to campaign for the J&K polls.Additional sessions judge Chander Jit Singh had reserved his order after an in-camera hearing. ""It is a huge relief (for Rashid) after having spent over five years in jail,"" said his counsel Vikhyat Oberoi .Lodged in Tihar jail since 2019 after being held in a terror funding case, Rashid moved a plea for 3 months' interim bail to participate in campaign.Rashid, who heads Awami Ittehad Party (AIP), contested as an independent candidate from the Baramulla Lok Sabha constituency and defeated National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah , earlier this year.The upcoming assembly elections- three-phase polls from Sept 18 to Oct 1 for 90 assembly seats - the first after the abrogation of Article 370, are being seen as a milestone, as Rashid's massive win over the former CM as well as Sajjad Lone of People's Conference in the Lok Sabha elections had created ripples in the Valley and changed the dynamics of electoral politics there. The victory came despite Rashid's incarceration - his sons campaigned for their father - making it even more significant, and had rattled the mainstream political parties in Kashmir. It was an indicator of the voter sentiments in the separatist landscape of the region.Both Omar and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti have alleged that Rashid is being pushed by BJP to weaken mainstream parties. Omar said: ""I feel sorry for the people of Baramulla. This bail is not to serve the people of north Kashmir but to get votes. After polls, Er Rashid will be back in Tihar...My only appeal is not to allow BJP's designs to succeed. If people want a BJP govt in J&K, then they should support AIP, PCP and Apni Party.""",Baramulla MP Sheikh Abdul Rashid granted interim bail till Oct 2. Rashid has been in Tihar jail since 2019 after being held in a terror funding case. The upcoming assembly elections- three-phase polls from Sept 18 to Oct 1 for 90 assembly seats.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113239239,imgsize-355164,width-400,resizemode-4/113239239.jpg"
'Opposing reservation is Rahul Gandhi's legacy': BJP on LoP's 'will scrap quota' remark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposing-reservation-is-rahul-gandhis-legacy-bjp-on-lops-will-scrap-quota-remark/articleshow/113230403.cms,"'Rahul Gandhi’s statement has exposed the mindset of the Congress party'

What did Rahul Gandhi say?

NEW DELHI: BJP's Ravi Shankar Prasad Tuesday came out strongly on Rahul Gandhi 's tirade against the BJP during his US trip and accused the Congress leader of habitually defaming India on foreign soil. The BJP leader in particular pounced on Rahul Gandhi's statement that he intended to ""scrap reservation at the right moment"" and said it was a reflection of the Congress leader's prejudice against the idea.“Rahul Gandhi, who claimed to save the Constitution, said in America that ‘when the conditions so warrant, of fairness, we will scrap reservation’. The prejudice against reservation which Rahul Gandhi has in abundance got reflected in America.”""Rahul creates ruckus when he goes abroad"".The ex-law minister went on to say it was Rahul Gandhi's legacy to oppose reservations. "" Nehru , Rajeev, Indira were all opposed to reservations"", he said. The BJP leader also argued that it was the grand old party that was against the deprived communities while the saffron party embraced the communities by appointing an OBC prime minister, Dalit President and many more chief ministers from the backward community.The BJP leader cited leaders like Prime Minister Modi, President Murmu , Kalyan Singh, Shivraj Singh Chouhan , Uma Bharati, Gopinath Munde, Mohan Yadav , who have risen in the party and touted it as an example of the party's commitment towards the backward communities. "" We don't say, we do,"" Ravi Shankar Prasad asserted.Ravi Shankar Prasad also targeted the INDIA bloc and asked DMK chief M K Stalin, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav and leaders of the Left parties to break their silence on Gandhi's remark.""I want to warn that if Congress tries to do any tampering with the provision of reservation or scrap it, the BJP will vehemently oppose it,"" he said.Meanwhile, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP-Ram Vilas)’s Chirag Paswan, a BJP ally that is a key constituent in the Centre’s ruling coalition, said the LoP's statements had exposed the Congress’ mindset, and stressed that even thinking of ending the quota system was an anti-constitutional move.“Rahul Gandhi ji, let alone ending reservation, even thinking about it is a crime! Today, Rahul Gandhi’s statement has exposed the mindset of the Congress party. Congress wants, and it has been one of their priorities, to end the reservation given by Baba Saheb Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar. Reservation is necessary to continue the constitutional system smoothly. In such a situation, let alone ending the reservation, no one can even think of tampering with that provision.”Earlier in the day, Rahul Gandhi who is on a trip to the US said the Congress Party would think of scrapping reservations when India is a fair place, which is not the case right now. “We will think of scrapping reservations when India is a fair place. And India is not a fair place,” the Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha , Rahul Gandhi told students in response to a question on reservation and how long it would continue.""The problem is that 90% of India is not able to play. Go through the list of every single business leader in India. I've done it. Show me the tribal name. Show me the Dalit name. Show me the OBC name. Out of the top 200, I think there's one OBC. They're 50% of India. But we're not treating the symptom,” he said.“There are many people who come from the upper caste who say, look, what have we done wrong? Why are we being punished? So, then you think about increasing dramatically the supply of some of these things. You think about decentralising power. You think about involving many more people in the governance of our country. You think of opening up. With all due respect, I don't think any of you are ever going to become Adani or Ambani. There's a reason for that. You can't. Because those doors are closed. So the answer to people in the general cast is you open those doors,” Rahul Gandhi said.",BJP's Ravi Shankar Prasad came out strongly on Rahul Gandhi's tirade against the BJP during his US trip.

Shame!,” he wrote.Earlier in the day, the Tamil Nadu BJP unit condemned the treatment of Tamil Nadu government school students like ""servants by you sitting in the position as a bandh while the school education department of Tamil Nadu is heading towards the underworld due to many administrative malpractices"".Is it social justice that you fear is making Tamil Nadu government school students clean school toilets and involve them in organizing government events?, BJP TN unit asked in its post on X.The response from the BJP came days after CM Stalin , who is on a US trip, hailed the 'Dravidian model' and exuded confidence that the DMK government is performing at the highest level on all fronts.","BJP hits out at ruling DMK government in Tamil Nadu over alleged ‘manual labour’ of school students in a government school ahead of sports minister Udhaynidhi Stalin's visit. “Shocked to hear that govt school children in Sivaganga were used in manual labour for preparing for an event,” BJP National Secretary and Tamil Nadu in-charge Aravind Menon wrote on X.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113236117,imgsize-18362,width-400,resizemode-4/113236117.jpg"

It's fighting back, but it was broken.""""I have seen the government of Maharashtra just being taken away from us.I've seen it with my own eyes. I've watched it, as our legislators have been bought in and hooked off and suddenly became BJP legislators. So Indian democracy has been under attack, has been very badly weakened, and now it's fighting back. And I'm confident that it'll fight back,"" Gandhi said.When asked if the election results give him more hope for democracy in India, Gandhi acknowledged that it does, but he also highlighted the importance of a level playing field for voters to make informed decisions.""Yeah, I mean, it does. But it's not good enough to say that the Indian voter is resilient and knowledgeable. Because the Indian voter is informed by a whole set of structures. So if we don't have a level playing field, the voter might be very knowledgeable and resilient. It doesn't really matter,"" he said.The opposition leader shared his own experiences, mentioning that his party fought an election with frozen bank accounts. ""We fought an election with our bank accounts frozen. I don't know any democracy where that's happened. Maybe that type of thing happened in Syria or used to happen in Iraq. But we literally sat during our election and spoke to our treasurer and he says, well, we have no money. Now, you can have a resilient voter. You still need to run campaigns. You still need to have conversations. You still need to have meetings,"" he said.""I've got 20-plus cases in me. I'm the only person in Indian history to get a prison sentence for defamation. We have a chief minister who's in jail right now. So, mean, one way of saying it is, yes, the Indian voter is very resilient, and he stands like a rock. Absolutely, he does. But the Indian voter requires an architecture to work on, which is not there,"" Gandhi said.Gandhi continued his criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , accusing him of portraying himself as a non-biological person with a direct link to God. ""Here's a prime minister of a modern country in the 21st century telling people that I speak to God. I'm different than everybody else. You are biological people. I'm a non-biological person. I have a direct link to God. And that for us was a game over (for the prime minister during the elections). We knew that we had defeated the prime minister,"" he said.""And then the beautiful thing was the first thing he did when he walked into the Lok Sabha , he was sworn in. He took the Constitution of India, and he placed it in his head,"" he added.""So, it was an interesting paradox. On one hand, he's destroying the Constitution. He's attacking the democratic structure.
