NEW DELHI: SC on Monday expressed concern over forest land being grabbed by private individuals in Uttarakhand and said it was shocking that the state govt remained a silent spectator over the years.While hearing an appeal on a litigation over a disputed parcel of forest land, a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi expanded the case and decided to examine the alleged grabbing of 2,866 acres of land - notified as govt forest land - and allegedly leased out in 1950 to Rishikesh-based society Pashu Lok Seva Samiti, which subsequently allotted land parcels to its members.""The facts prima facie show as to how thousands of acres of forest land has been systematically grabbed by private individuals...What seems to be shocking to us is that the State of Uttarakhand and its authorities are sitting as silent spectators when the forest land is being systematically grabbed in front of their eyes. Consequently, we propose to enlarge the scope of these proceedings suo motu. Let notice be issued,"" it said.The bench ordered a probe into the case and sought a report from govt authorities. It directed all parties concerned to maintain status quo.It said land in dispute would not be sold or alienated, and no further construction would be carried out. It directed that no third party right will be created over the disputed land.""The chief secretary and principal chief conservator of forests are directed to constitute an enquiry committee to examine facts and submit a report to this court. Private individuals are restrained from alienating the land or creating third party rights. No construction shall be allowed. The vacant land, other than residential houses, shall be taken into possession by forest department and collector concerned,"" bench said.In this case, a large chunk of land - 2,866 acres - was leased out to Pashulok Seva Samiti in 1950 for allotting it to landless poor families of the area. The society surrendered 594 acres of land to forest dept in 1984. But the dispute arose after the petitioner claimed to have taken possession of the land in 2001.",SC expresses concern over forest land being grabbed by private individuals in Uttarakhand.
