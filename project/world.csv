Bombay HC nixes PIL against Maharashtra order to issue Kunbi caste certs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-nixes-pil-against-maharashtra-order-to-issue-kunbi-caste-certs/articleshow/123988465.cms,"Mumbai: Observing there is a need to discourage the trend of multiplicity of litigation, Bombay HC Thursday dismissed a PIL challenging Maharashtra govt's decision to issue Kunbi caste certificates to members of Maratha community. ""It is in the larger public interest that there should not be multiplicity of litigations, where different individuals file applications one after the other under the guise of public interest,"" HC said.A bench of CJ Shree Chandrashekhar and Justice Gautam Ankhad remarked that the petitioner, an advocate from SC community, was not an aggrieved party. The state advocate general Birendra Saraf submitted that over half a dozen petitions were already pending before various benches, challenging the same GR. Saraf said the GR doesn't pertain to SC certificates. ""It simply sets up a mechanism to facilitate an enquiry into whether a Maratha individual can prove Kunbi ancestry. It does not affect the SCs in any manner,"" he said. The PIL was originally intended to give a voice to the voiceless masses or sections of society, the HC orally observed and added, ""A writ petition, claiming to be a PIL involving a subject matter of this nature, is clearly not in the category of cases where the writ court should grant indulgence. Wishful thinking or merely raising an arguable issue is not a ground for PIL."""," Bombay HC dismisses PIL challenging Maharashtra govt's decision to issue Kunbi caste certificates to members of Maratha community.

'Trump admin crackdown': Immigration court orders Mahmoud Khalil deportation to Syria or Algeria,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-admin-crackdown-immigration-court-orders-mahmoud-khalil-deportation-to-syria-or-algeria-heres-why/articleshow/123962003.cms,"Mahmoud Khalil (Image/X)

‘Obey Immigration Laws Or…’: Trump’s Stark Warning After ‘Humiliating’ ICE Raid On U.S. Ally





An immigration judge in Louisiana has ordered pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the US, to be deported to Syria or Algeria for allegedly failing to disclose certain information on his green card application, according to court documents filed Wednesday by his lawyers.Khalil’s attorneys indicated they plan to appeal the deportation order but expressed concern that the process would likely be swift and unfavorable.The ruling by Immigration Judge Jamee Comans comes despite a separate federal court order in New Jersey that blocks Khalil’s deportation while the court considers his claim that his detention and deportation are unlawful retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians, as reported by Politico.Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student who helped organize pro-Palestinian campus protests, was arrested on March 8 at his Manhattan residence and detained in Louisiana.He has not been charged with any crime. His arrest was part of the President Donald Trump administration’s wider effort to target foreign-born pro-Palestinian academics legally studying or working in the US.In a letter to New Jersey Federal Judge Michael Farbiarz, Khalil’s lawyers said they have 30 days from September 12, the date of the Louisiana judge’s ruling, to appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).They noted that the BIA process is typically fast and that appeals to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals are rarely successful, particularly for stays of removal for noncitizens.“As a result,” the lawyers wrote, “the only meaningful impediment to Petitioner’s physical removal from the United States would be this Court’s important order prohibiting removal during the pendency of his federal habeas case.” They further added that nothing else would preserve his lawful permanent resident status.In a statement, Khalil, originally from Syria, criticized the Trump administration of using 'fascist tactics'.“It is no surprise that the Trump administration continues to retaliate against me for my exercise of free speech. Their latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again,” he said.Earlier this year, Khalil spent more than three months in detention after the Trump administration invoked a rarely used provision of immigration law that allows deportation of noncitizens, even legal permanent residents if the Secretary of State determines their presence harms US foreign policy interests.In June, Judge Farbiarz, a former President Joe Biden appointee, blocked Khalil’s deportation on foreign policy grounds and ordered his release, determining he was neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community. Khalil then returned to New York, reuniting with his wife, a US citizen and their newborn son, who was born during his detention.The Trump administration has since pursued Khalil’s deportation on another basis, alleging that he failed to fully disclose his past employment and memberships in certain organizations on his green card application.","Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student who helped organize pro-Palestinian campus protests, was arrested on March 8 at his Manhattan residence.

Trump repeats claim he stopped India-Pak war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trump-repeats-claim-he-stopped-india-pak-war/articleshow/123983639.cms,"LONDON: US President Donald Trump repeated his claim at a press conference at Chequers, the UK PM’s official country retreat, that his intervention had stopped the brief India-Pakistan conflict earlier this year, a claim refuted umpteen times by India.Trump, speaking on the final day of his state visit to Britain, said he personally had stopped seven wars since coming to power. “Most were not thought to be settleable but we did India, we did Pakistan, two nuclear powers. That was purely for trade. We told them if you want to trade with us, you will have to get along, and they were going at it hot and heavy,” he said. He added he felt “let down” by Russian President Vladimir Putin that he could not add the war in Ukraine to that list.“If the price of oil comes down, Putin will have no choice but to drop out of that war,” he said as he and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer vowed to ramp up the pressure on Putin. “When I found out that the European nations were buying oil from Russia, I am very close to India and to the PM of India, I wished him a Happy Birthday the other day, we have a very good relationship, but I sanctioned them (India). I am willing to do other things, but not when the people I am fighting for are buying oil from Russia.That’s not playing fair with the USA,” he said.He also said the US is trying to get Bagram airbase back from Afghanistan as it is in a strategic position an hour away from where China makes nuclear weapons. “We were supposed to leave with strength and dignity and keep Bagram,” he said.On Gaza, Trump said he opposed a Palestinian state whilst Hamas still had Israeli hostages, calling it a point of disagreement with Starmer.The pair had earlier held bilateral talks, attended a business reception and toured the Winston Churchill Archives. Trump is a big Churchill fan.US tech and finance giants have announced £150 billion (Rs 17.2 lakh crore) in investments in the UK, creating 7,600 jobs to coincide with the state visit, including plans to build in the UK the largest AI supercomputer in Europe.The First Lady and Queen Camilla looked around Queen Mary’s Dolls’ House at Windsor Castle, the largest dolls’ house in the world, designed by Edwin Lutyens. It contains a fully stocked wine cellar, working lifts, running water and a miniature library with 200 original works hand-written by famous writers. Melania particularly liked “The Gruffalo”.At the state banquet on Wednesday, Trump hailed the British Empire laying the foundations of “law, liberty, free speech and individual rights virtually everywhere the Union Jack has ever flown”.“Together, we’ve done more good for humanity than any two countries in all of history,” he said.","US President Donald Trump said he personally had stopped seven wars since coming to power. “Most were not thought to be settleable but we did India, we did Pakistan, two nuclear powers.

Poll Do you believe that asking for a woman's phone number without consent is inappropriate? Yes, it's completely inappropriate No, it's acceptable in some situations

NEW DELHI: A video from Amritsar is going viral on social media, where a foreign tourist confronted a local man for asking his wife’s phone number without her consent. The woman said the man approached them and directly requested her contact details, which she found intrusive and inappropriate.In the video, the tourist questions the man, saying, “Why are you asking for her phone number? What you did is very strange. You are very strange. You approach a random female by herself and ask for her phone number within two seconds; that's very strange. Yeah, you shouldn't do that again, ok. You are a bit crazy.”The man, who identified himself as a student, tried to ease the tension by referring to the woman as “sister” before walking away abruptly.(The TOI couldn't independently verify the authenticity of this video.)The video has attracted widespread attention, with many social media users expressing frustration over such behavior and its impact on the city and country’s reputation, known for its cultural heritage and hospitality.One user shared, “I am not surprised, last year I went on a road trip with my then gf and people wouldn't stop asking her for photos, this was when I was with her! If she were alone, I could only assume how much worse it would have been.A couple of them even asked me to get them to be 'friends' with her.”Another commented, “I just went through a similar experience with a friend who recently visited India. Morons would walk up to her and ask her for a selfie, even the women! I would then have to rudely shoo them away. I had to explain to her that it's perfectly normal to just ignore people. Incidents like these just tarnish the image of the nation!”A third user criticized the man’s attempt to deflect responsibility, stating, “So after harassing an unknown person, you can just get away by saying 'sister'?”One woman questioned the recurring pattern, saying, “Why are Indian Men like this! In Amritsar an Indian man was caught asking for the phone number of ‘Gori Mam’. And what is this πJeet behaviour in the end.”Similar reports have surfaced from other parts of India, including an incident involving a Dutch woman who was harassed on a train traveling from Delhi to Agra.These incidents have reignited conversations about respecting women in public spaces and the need for greater awareness and sensitivity.","A video from Amritsar is going viral on social media, where a foreign tourist confronted a local man for asking his wife’s phone number without her consent.

The Trucial States and British Control: Foundations of UAE National Day





1820–1853: A series of treaties were signed between Britain and the ruling sheikhs, starting with the defeat of the Qawasim maritime force. These agreements aimed to curb maritime conflict, prohibit the construction of warships or coastal fortifications, and maintain peace at sea.

1853: The Perpetual Maritime Truce formalized an indefinite end to hostilities at sea. Britain limited its role to maritime security without interfering in the internal governance of the emirates.

1892: The Exclusive Agreements prohibited the Trucial States from engaging with foreign powers without British approval. In exchange, the UK pledged military protection against external threats.



Path to federation: Early steps toward UAE National Day





February 18, 1968: Sheikh Zayed met with Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum of Dubai at Al Samha . They agreed to unite their emirates and invite others to join, forming the first step toward regional federation — the Union Accord.



They agreed to collaborate on foreign affairs, defense, security, social services, and immigration policy. Judicial and internal governance would remain under individual emirate control.

The proposed Federation of the Arab Emirates was based on 11 foundational principles including mutual respect for sovereignty, unified foreign policy, and joint developmental goals. A Supreme Council was to be established to oversee federal legislation and policy, with decisions requiring unanimous consent.

December 2, 1971: The birth of the UAE and National Day





July 18, 1971: The six Rulers formally agreed to establish a federation.

December 2, 1971: The United Arab Emirates was officially declared an independent, sovereign state.



A Provisional Constitution was adopted. Abu Dhabi was designated as the temporary capital. Sheikh Zayed was elected as the first President; Sheikh Rashid became Vice-President, both for a five-year term. The Federal National Council (FNC) was established with 34 seats:



8 each for Abu Dhabi and Dubai 6 for Sharjah 4 each for Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, and Fujairah Ras Al Khaimah was allocated 6 seats should it choose to join later.



UAE National Day: Completion of the union, constitution, and global standing

The constitution

The Provisional Constitution guided federal operations from 1971 until it was made permanent in July 1996.

It consists of 152 articles, establishing the foundation of:



Governance Distribution of federal and local powers Citizens’ rights National security, judiciary, and legislative structure



Federal goals outlined in the constitution:

Preserve the UAE’s independence and sovereignty

Ensure security and stability

Defend against any external aggression

Protect citizens' rights and freedoms

Promote economic prosperity, better standards of living, and unified national identity

Uphold each emirate’s internal autonomy within the constitutional framework

Why the federation worked

Common language and religion

Shared customs, traditions, and topography

Complementary economic resources

UAE National Day and the country’s rise on the global stage





December 2, 1971: Joined the Arab League as its 18th member

December 9, 1971: Gained admission to the United Nations

1972: Became a member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)

1981: Co-founded the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.





December 2 marks a pivotal moment in the history of the United Arab Emirates — the day it became an independent, sovereign nation in 1971. But the choice of this date was not symbolic alone; it was the culmination of decades of treaties, negotiations, British withdrawal, and a shared vision among the region's leaders. This is the detailed story of how the UAE came to be, why December 2 became its National Day, and the constitutional foundations that shaped the Federation.The territory that is now the UAE was historically known as the Trucial States, a group of independent emirates along the southern coast of the Persian Gulf. British involvement in the region began in the early 19th century:British control over the region intensified in the mid-20th century, largely driven by oil exploration and geopolitical interests. They controlled oil concession grants and intervened in territorial disputes to secure exploration zones, including helping define inter-emirate boundaries in the 1950s.However, by 1968, economic constraints pushed the UK to announce a full military and political withdrawal from the Gulf by end of 1971. This move set off a chain of political activity among the Trucial States’ rulers to form a new, self-governed entity before the British departure.The initiative to form a unified state began with Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who became Ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1966. Seeing the necessity of regional cooperation, he envisioned a federation that could unify resources and political will.Despite this progress, Bahrain and Qatar opted for independent statehood in August and September 1971, respectively.As the British exit approached, six emirates — Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, and Fujairah — committed to forming a new union.The Supreme Council of Rulers, composed of the Rulers of each emirate, became the highest federal authority. Decisions would require a majority vote — with both Abu Dhabi and Dubai needed to be part of the majority for any decision to pass.Article 138 specifically enabled the unification of the UAE Armed Forces under federal command, ensuring centralized defense policy and organization.Several shared factors helped facilitate a smooth transition to federation:Immediately after its formation, the UAE began establishing itself as a credible state in the international community:","December 2 marks the UAE’s formation, uniting seven emirates into a strong, independent federation.

Why is Trump eyeing Bagram airbase?







United States president Donald Trump on Thursday said he was working to ""get back"" Bagram airbase, which the United States gave up control of after the 2021 Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.""We're trying to get it back, by the way, that could be a little breaking news. We're trying to get it back because they need things from us. We want that base back,"" Trump said at a press conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.Trump claimed his intention to return American forces to Afghanistan’s Bagram Airbase is because “China now controls Bagram.”About a month earlier, Trump had suggested the US might return to Afghanistan, saying, “We are going to keep a small force on Bagram” to counter China’s growing influence.Trump stressed that his focus on Bagram was not about Afghanistan itself.“We wanted to keep this base because of China, not because of Afghanistan,” he said, noting the airbase’s proximity to China’s nuclear facilities, “just an hour” away, as its key strategic value.Bagram Airbase has long been one of the United States’ most important military assets in South Asia, valued for both its location and its capabilities.Located about 40 kilometres north of Kabul, it sits close to the borders of China, Pakistan, Iran, and Central Asia, giving the US a forward-operating hub near some of the world’s most volatile regions.Its proximity to China’s Xinjiang region, where Beijing maintains nuclear and military facilities, made it particularly significant for American strategic planning.During the US presence in Afghanistan, Bagram was the largest American airbase in the country. It had multiple runways capable of handling heavy bombers and transport aircraft, housed thousands of US and Nato troops at its peak, and included extensive infrastructure such as command centers, detention facilities, and logistics hubs. This made it the nerve center of US military operations in Afghanistan for nearly two decades.Beyond Afghanistan, Bagram gave Washington the ability to project power across South and Central Asia, carry out surveillance, support counterterrorism missions, and monitor regional adversaries like China, Russia, Iran, and Pakistan. Symbolically too, the base represented the scale of America’s military footprint in the region.Its abrupt abandonment during the 2021 withdrawal was seen by many analysts as a strategic mistake, as it left the facility open to Taliban control and raised concerns about possible Chinese interest in the site.","US president Donald Trump said he was working to ""get back"" Bagram airbase.

HYDERABAD: What began as a fairytale wedding for a young woman from Lakdikapul has turned into a nightmare. Hana Ahmed Khan, 31, has knocked on the doors of the Chicago police and India's ministry of external affairs after her husband, a US-based police officer, allegedly abandoned her in Hyderabad and returned to America, taking along her passport, green card, and vital documents.Hana married Mohammad Zain Uddin, 36, a native of Nimboliadda in Kachiguda who later became a US citizen, on June 22, 2022, at a mosque in Abids in the presence of both families. It was only in Feb 2024 that she could finally join him in the US after completing all official formalities. There, she received her green card and social security number, marking the start of what she hoped would be a new life.But her dreams shattered within a year. On Feb 7, 2025, the couple flew to Hyderabad and checked into a city hotel. A few days later, Zain allegedly asked Hana to visit her family — and while she was away, he quietly checked out, boarded a flight back to the US, and left with her immigration papers, passport, and identification.""I was devastated. He didn't just abandon me, he also shut every door for me to even fight my case legally in the US,"" Hana told social workers.Left stranded, Hana has now appealed to the MEA to help her return to America to pursue legal action.She said her husband sent her father a WhatsApp message claiming he had obtained a divorce decree from a US court. ""I don't even know how or when I was divorced,"" she reportedly told her family.Social worker and MBT leader Amjed Ullah Khan has written to external affairs minister S Jaishankar, urging intervention. ""At the very least, the US embassy in Delhi and the consulate in Hyderabad should hear her out and help her secure a duplicate green card so that she can travel back to fight her case,"" he wrote.Hana has since obtained a fresh passport from the Hyderabad regional passport office, after lodging a complaint that her husband had taken away her original.Hana's brother Mohammed Munawar alleged that her ordeal began long before this. ""When my sister was in Chicago, he assaulted her. The matter even reached the notice of the Chicago police, who counselled them. Later, when she called the authorities again in June, they took her statement and recorded past incidents of assault,"" he said.Munawar added that his father, Ahmed Munawar Khan, confronted Zain about abandoning Hana, only to be told bluntly that he had already divorced her. ""It came as a shock to us. My father is heartbroken. We do not accept such sudden divorces in our family. My sister deserves justice,"" he said.","Hana Ahmed Khan, 31, has knocked on the doors of the Chicago police and India's ministry of external affairs.

Shivakumar on exit threats : Let them go, no other city can match B’luru

Attack on BJP





BENGALURU: Unfazed by criticism over the city's crumbling infrastructure, deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar , who is also the Bengaluru development minister, hit back at corporates looking to move out of Bengaluru, saying: ""No one can threaten or blackmail the govt. I will not stop anyone from going. ""Shivakumar's retort follows city-based logistics platform BlackBuck's decision to move out of Bellandur (off Outer Ring Road) after nine years, citing worsening road conditions.Several other corporate honchos and start-up founders, too, have voiced their discontent over the poor state of the road in the ORR-Mahadevapura stretch.In fact, Andhra Pradesh IT minister Nara Lokesh had welcomed BlackBuck co-founder Rajesh Yabaji, urging him to consider shifting base to Visakhapatnam.Shivakumar, however, stuck to his guns. He told media Thursday: ""I wish them all the good luck. If they are not satisfied with manpower, talent, or facilities, I cannot stop them, but no one can threaten the govt - I am telling you this.""After Shivakumar's statement, BlackBuck toned down its stance: ""We're only relocating within the city to a different location, which will facilitate an easy commute for our employees.""The DCM said areas like Mahadevapura faced unique challenges, where some localities fell under corporation limits, while others didn't.The minister highlighted the govt’s recent restructuring of civic governance by establishing Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA) under which the city has been split into five corporations comprising 198 wards to address rising population pressures.Admitting that areas like Mahadevapura face unique challenges, the deputy CM said: “Some localities fall under corporation limits, others don’t. We have increased ward sizes because constituencies now have three times the population they once did.”Shivakumar had earlier reasoned: “No one will go out of Bengaluru for infrastructure reasons. If they do, it will be due to business or financial problems. Blackmailing the govt will not help. Let them go wherever they want — no city can match Bengaluru.”Weighing in on the issue, Lokesh posted on X: “Here is what sets AP apart from others — we don’t dismiss our people’s genuine grievances as ‘blackmail’. We treat them with the dignity and seriousness they deserve.”Shivakumar, meanwhile, trained his guns on BJP and its political allies. While asking citizens to ponder over why the BJP MLA of Mahadevapura (the constituency that houses the tech corridor) was silent on the issue of failing infrastructure, he asked: “Why didn’t the opposition leaders and BJP MPs get central funds for Bengaluru?” Defending his govt, Shivakumar further said potholes near Vidhana Soudha were being fixed. “Just because people tweet about it, we cannot stop our work. Why is Bengaluru being singled out?” he asked.","Deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar hits back at corporates looking to move out of Bengaluru. Says: ""No one can threaten or blackmail the govt.

AHMEDABAD: A Gujarati woman was shot dead during a robbery attempt at her convenience store in Union County late Tuesday night.The victim was identified as Kiran Patel, 49, who ran DD's Food Mart on South Pinckney Street.Police said they received a call around 10.30pm about a man firing shots outside the store. When officers arrived, they found Patel lying unresponsive in the parking lot with gunshot wounds. Emergency medical services later confirmed her death.According to investigators, surveillance video captured the sequence of events.A masked man entered the store with a gun and demanded money from Patel, who was working alone.During the confrontation, the assailant fired a shot, and Patel tried to resist by throwing something at him. The robber then climbed onto the cash register counter and fired multiple rounds inside the store.Patel attempted to flee towards the parking lot, but the gunman chased her, continuing to shoot.She collapsed just 20 feet away from the store entrance after being struck by bullets. Officers also recovered shell casings and found the store's front window shattered.The Union County coroner's office confirmed Patel's identity and said she suffered fatal injuries from the gunfire.This tragedy comes at a time when the US is witnessing renewed debate over gun control laws.South Carolina, like many states, allows relatively easy access to firearms, and incidents of violence at small businesses have become frequent. Community members described Patel as a hardworking immigrant who ran the store for years and was well-known in the area.The Union Public Safety Department has launched a manhunt for the suspect, who fled the scene after the shooting.Police said they are reviewing CCTV footage and have appealed to the public for information.","The victim was identified as Kiran Patel, 49, who ran DD's Food Mart on South Pinckney Street.

US President Donald Trump used the final day of his state visit to Britain to take aim at London Mayor Sadiq Khan, saying he personally requested that Khan be excluded from official events.Asked by a reporter about the mayor’s absence from the ceremonies, the US president replied bluntly: “I don’t want him there. I asked that he not be there. I don’t want. I think the Mayor of London Khan is among the worst mayors in the world. And we have some bad ones.”Trump went on to compare Khan to the mayor of Chicago, adding: “I think he’s done a terrible job. Crime in London is through the roof. The Mayor of London, Khan. Mayor Khan has done a terrible job. And on immigration, he’s a disaster.”The president said Khan had wanted to attend but he blocked it. “I asked that he not be there. He wanted to be there, as I understand. I didn’t want him. I’ve not liked him for a long [time],” Trump said. “I just think, you know, I have a certain pride in London and UK. My mother was born in Scotland, as you know. And when I see Mayor Khan do a bad job, the stabbings and the dirt in the film, it’s not the same.No, I didn’t want him there. ”Trump also took a shot at California Governor Gavin Newsom, tying him to Khan in his critique of urban leadership. “If you look at Chicago. If you look at… I think [Khan] is the equivalent of the Mayor of Chicago,” Trump said, before broadening his attack to what he described as Democratic mismanagement of US cities.Despite the sharp words for Khan, Trump praised the royal family and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, calling King Charles and Queen Camilla “two fantastic people” and describing his reception as “tremendously thankful” and “grateful beyond words.”The president and Starmer signed a major agreement on science and technology, with US companies pledging billions in investment. Both leaders also discussed Ukraine, Gaza and trade, with Trump saying the two countries share a bond “like no other anywhere in the world.”The president wrapped up his visit after a ceremonial farewell at Windsor Castle and talks at Chequers, flying back to Washington on Thursday evening.","US President Donald Trump takes aim at London Mayor Sadiq Khan.

Is the United States preparing to return troops to Afghanistan to reclaim its foothold in a strategically vital region and counter China? On Thursday, US President Donald Trump openly acknowledged his goal ""to get back"" the Bagram airbase in Afghanistan, after Taliban takeover in 2021.Trump, speaking publicly about these discussions for the first time, told reporters his administration is working to regain control of the base, located about an hour north of Kabul.The Taliban seized Bagram following the collapse of the Afghan government and the US military withdrawal in 2021.""We gave it to (the Taliban) for nothing,"" Trump said during a joint press conference with UK Prime Minister Kier Starmer on Thursday.""It's an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons,"" the US president said.""We're trying to get it back, by the way, that could be a little breaking news. We're trying to get it back because they need things from us. We want that base back,"" Trump said at the press conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.According to CNN sources, discussions about returning the base to US control began as far back as March.Trump and his senior national security officials see Bagram as vital for several reasons: monitoring China, whose border lies under 500 miles away; gaining access to Afghanistan's rare earth elements and mining sector; establishing a counterterrorism node to target ISIS; and potentially reopening a diplomatic facility.Trump also reiterated on Thursday that Bagram is near where China makes missiles -- a claim he had first made in March.""We were going to get out, but we were going to keep Bagram, not because of Afghanistan but because of China, because it’s exactly one hour away from where China makes its nuclear missiles,"" he said in March. ""We were going to keep a small force on Bagram.""The last US troops left Bagram Air Base in July 2021. For nearly two decades, it had been the center of US military power in Afghanistan.At the time of withdrawal, US forces removed the equivalent of nearly 900 C-17 cargo loads and destroyed nearly 16,000 pieces of equipment, according to US Central Command.","US President Donald Trump openly acknowledged his goal ""to get back"" the Bagram airbase in Afghanistan.

Nepal In Flames: PM KP Oli Resigns, Flees In Army Chopper As Gen Z Protesters Burn Down Parliament





Days after massive unrest upended Nepal’s political situation, deposed Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has shifted from army protection to a private residence. According to news agency PTI, citing Nepal army sources, Oli spent nine days under army security before moving out.Oli had flown to an army barracks -- believed to be in the Shivapuri forest area, north of Kathmandu on September 9, immediately after the Gen Z-led protests turned violent and he resigned as Prime Minister.After nine days in army security, the chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) (CPN-UML) relocated to a private location, the Nepal Army confirmed.However, his current address has not been officially disclosed. Media reports indicate that Oli has shifted to a private house in the Gundu area of Bhaktapur district, about 15 km east of Kathmandu.During the second day of the protests on September 9, Gen Z demonstrators burned Oli’s house in Balkot, Bhaktapur, to ashes. On the same day, while Oli was at the official residence of the Nepal Prime Minister, protesters also partially torched the Prime Minister’s Office in Balkot. He was safely evacuated by a Nepal Army helicopter.Several other senior political figures -- including former Prime Ministers Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda,’ Sher Bahadur Deuba, Jhalanath Khanal, Madhav Kumar Nepal, and others -- had also taken shelter under army protection for a few days. At present, only Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba and his spouse, former foreign minister Arzju Rana Deuba, remain under army security. The couple sustained injuries during the protests and are currently receiving hospital treatment under military protection.Meanwhile, the CPN-UML, led by Oli, is planning a separate event to mark Constitution Day on September 19 at Chyasal in Lalitpur district, where the party’s central office is located. However, it remains uncertain whether Oli will attend the programme.Nepal will observe Constitution Day on Ashoj 3 of the Bikram Era calendar—September 19 this year—marking the promulgation of the country’s constitution drafted by the Constituent Assembly on September 20, 2015.The Nepal government is organising a grand celebration in Kathmandu on September 19 to mark Constitution Day and has declared a public holiday for the occasion. President Ramchandra Paudel, Prime Minister Sushila Karki, the Nepal army chief, ministers and other dignitaries are scheduled to attend.","Deposed PM KP Sharma Oli has shifted from army protection to a private residence.

JD Vance hosts 'The Charlie Kirk Show': US VP lashes out at liberals; recalls Erika’s tribute,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-hosts-the-charlie-kirk-show-us-vp-lashes-out-at-liberals-recalls-erikas-tribute/articleshow/123911323.cms,"Trump Unleashes Crackdown After Kirk’s Murder: Visa Bans, Mass Firings, Military Probes Sweep US





US Vice-President JD Vance has said that national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk , warning that such behaviour fuels further political violence.Speaking as guest host of The Charlie Kirk Show on Monday, Vance said: “Call them out, and hell, call their employer. We don't believe in political violence, but we do believe in civility.”The vice-president took over presenting duties from his ceremonial office at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, with the programme livestreamed into the White House press briefing room. It was the first episode of the podcast since Kirk, 31, was fatally shot in the neck while moderating a debate at Utah Valley University last week.Vance, who flew Kirk’s body home to Arizona aboard Air Force Two, said he was “filling in for somebody who cannot be filled in for”. He recounted conversations with Kirk’s widow Erika, describing him as “a kind, loving husband”, and admitted her words had inspired him to “be a better husband and… a better father”.In his remarks, Vance directly challenged those making light of Kirk’s assassination. “There is no unity with the people who celebrate Charlie Kirk's assassination,” he said.“There is no unity with someone who lies about what Charlie Kirk said in order to excuse his murder… And there is no unity with the people who fund these articles, who pay the salaries of these terrorist sympathisers who argue that Charlie Kirk, a loving husband and father, deserved a shot to the neck because he spoke words with which they disagree. ”He added: “I’m desperate for our country to be united in condemnation of the actions and the ideas that killed my friend. I want it so badly that I will tell you a difficult truth. We can only have it with people who acknowledge that political violence is unacceptable.”Other Republicans have echoed calls for accountability. Florida congressman Randy Fine said he would “demand their firing, defunding, and licence revocation”, while South Carolina’s Nancy Mace urged federal funding to be cut from universities that refuse to act.Vance, who described Kirk as a close friend and mentor, credited him with helping President Donald Trump’s re-election and with shaping the administration. “If it weren't for Charlie Kirk, I would not be the vice president of the United States,” he said.","US Vice-President JD Vance said national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

The United States vetoed a UN Security Council resolution on Thursday demanding an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and hostage release, citing insufficient condemnation of Hamas.The remaining 14 Security Council members supported the resolution, which highlighted Gaza's 'catastrophic' humanitarian situation and urged Israel to remove aid delivery restrictions affecting 2.1 million Palestinians.The vote came as Israeli tanks and jets pounded Gaza City, the target of a major new ground offensive, forcing Palestinians to flee south.The vote underscores US and Israeli isolation regarding the Gaza conflict, preceding the UN General Assembly where Gaza will be prominent.

New Twist? Teacher claims Celeste Rivas ran off with D4vd; shares photo in class,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-twist-teacher-claims-celeste-rivas-ran-off-with-d4vd-shares-photo-in-class/articleshow/123987918.cms,"



A former teacher of Celeste Rivas, the 15-year-old girl whose body was discovered inside singer D4vd’s car, has made a startling claim about her past, TMZ reported. Speaking in front of students, the science teacher alleged that Rivas first vanished after meeting the rising artist on social media and even ran away with him to Hollywood before being brought back home by police.As per TMZ, the teacher, who previously taught Rivas at Lakeland Village Middle School in Lake Elsinore, California, told his current pupils that he wanted to share her story as a “cautionary tale” about the dangers of online connections. He displayed a photo of himself with Rivas taken years earlier and claimed she had been “missing since I taught her.” He added that she disappeared a second time in May 2024, and he had not heard of her again until police confirmed her death this month.Rivas was identified by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner as the girl found inside a bag in the front trunk of a Tesla registered to 20-year-old singer David Anthony Burke, known as D4vd. The car, with Texas plates, had been abandoned on a Los Angeles street before being towed to a Hollywood lot, where workers discovered her remains on 8 September. Officials said the cause of death remains “deferred” pending further examination.TMZ reported that it received a tip about Rivas being the victim and contacted her mother, who recognised a key detail. Police had mentioned a “Shhh…” tattoo on the victim’s finger, a tattoo her daughter also had. The mother further disclosed that Celeste had a boyfriend named David, and TMZ noted that the singer himself bears the same tattoo.Photographs reviewed by the outlet appeared to place D4vd in Lake Elsinore, near Rivas’s family home, months before her disappearance. Another image circulating online suggested he was with a girl resembling Rivas, though authorities have not confirmed this.The singer, who rose to fame with his 2022 viral hit *Romantic Homicide*, has since cancelled upcoming concerts, including one in Seattle. Police have not said whether he is being treated as a suspect, and neither he nor his representatives have issued a statement as the investigation continues.","Celeste Rivas, 15, was found dead in the trunk of singer D4vd's car on 8 September.

Utah Attorney Exposes Stunning Details About Kirk's Killer; 'Delete Texts & Stay Silent'

Past remarks on Kirk’s assassination :

Republican backlash and resolution to strip committees:



Trump joins in with criticism:

.





Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar has drawn widespread backlash after calling people who are honoring slain conservative leader Charlie Kirk “full of s***.” Speaking at an event, Omar said Kirk was a “hateful man” and accused his supporters of “rewriting history.”“I do believe those of you interested in rewriting this hateful man’s history are full of sht,” Omar declared. This prompted immediate backlash from Republicans and Kirk’s supporters.Omar had previously reacted to Kirk’s assassination during an interview with journalist Mehdi Hasan on his Zeteo platform. She condemned Republican attacks on the left in the aftermath of the shooting, calling them “full of s***.”“You have people like Nancy Mace, who constantly harass, you know, people that she finds inferior and wants them not to exist in this country or ever,” Omar told Hasan, as reported by the Hill.“And, you know, you have people like Trump, who has incited violence against people like me. And so, you know, these people are full of s***, and it’s important for us to call them out while we feel anger and sadness,” she added.Omar also said the video and news of Kirk’s killing were deeply disturbing. “It was really mortifying to hear the news, to see the video. You know, all I could think about was his wife, his children, that image is going to live forever,” she said.Kirk’s death had already triggered a heated political debate. Her remarks prompted Republican Representative Nancy Mace to introduce a resolution to strip Omar of her committee assignments, accusing her of “smearing” Kirk and “implying he was to blame for his own murder,” as reported by the Independent.In a post on X, Mace said: “Nothing warms our hearts more than the flood of calls from Ilhan Omar's own district backing our move to censure her and strip her committees. One caller put it best: ‘She’s Somalia First.’”President Donald Trump also weighed in, telling reporters in the Oval Office that he supported removing Omar from her committee roles, according to New York Post.“I think she’s a disgraceful person,” Trump said. “You know, I think she’s a disgraceful person, a loser. It’s amazing the way people vote — I know it’s people from her area, maybe all over the world. They got here, and they vote her in. It’s hard to believe, but I think she’s a disgusting person.”This is not the first time the US president has slammed the congresswoman. In a recent post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, “Ilhan Omar’s Country of Somalia is plagued by a lack of central Government control, persistent Poverty, Hunger, Resurgent Terrorism, Piracy, decades of Civil War, Corruption and pervasive Violence. 70% of the population lives in extreme Poverty, and widespread Food Insecurity. Somalia is consistently ranked among the World’s Most Corrupt Countries, including Bribery, Embezzlement, and a Dysfunctional Government.""All of this, and Ilhan Omar tells us how to run America! P.S. Wasn’t she the one that married her brother in order to gain Citizenship??? What SCUM we have in our Country, telling us what to do, and how to do it. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!,"" the post added.Claims that Omar married her brother have circulated for years. Omar has denied that she and her second husband were related and has pushed back forcefully against posts repeating the allegation. When a post recently claimed to “confirm” the marriage, Omar replied: “The only thing that is confirmed is your stupidity, hope that helps.”Omar, who fled Somalia with her family during the country’s bloody civil war, spent four years in a Kenyan refugee camp before being granted asylum in the United States in 1995.Charlie Kirk was assassinated last week while speaking at an outdoor event in Utah. Prosecutors announced that the 22-year-old Tyler Robinson accused of killing Kirk during his appearance at Utah Valley University has been charged with capital murder and they intend to seek the death penalty.","Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar has drawn widespread backlash after calling people who are honoring slain conservative leader Charlie Kirk “full of s***” Republican Representative Nancy Mace introduced a resolution to strip Omar of her committee assignments.

A US Army MH-60 Black Hawk helicopter carrying four service members crashed during a routine training mission near Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state late Wednesday, sparking a wildfire and prompting a large-scale emergency response.The Army confirmed the incident in a statement on Thursday, but did not disclose the condition of those on board. The helicopter belonged to the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, known as the “Night Stalkers.” The cause of the crash remains under investigation.“This remains an active, ongoing situation,” the Army said. Army spokesperson Ruth Castro told the Associated Press that the incident was being treated as a search mission, adding that the “most professional and skilled” personnel were handling the response and were fully cooperating with law enforcement.The helicopter went down at around 9 p.m. local time in the Summit Lake area, west of Olympia, according to local officials. The crash ignited a fire that had grown to about one acre by Thursday morning, said the Washington Department of Natural Resources. Crews from multiple agencies, including military units and wildfire staff, were deployed to contain the blaze.Thurston County Sheriff Derek Sanders said deputies reached the crash site but were initially unable to continue rescue efforts because of the fire.“Deputies have located the crash site but have been unable to continue rescue efforts as the scene is on fire and is starting to overheat their footwear,” he said on Facebook.Rescue helicopters, including King County’s Guardian 1, and special operations units were also dispatched to the area. Flight-tracking data suggested the Black Hawk’s signal was last detected shortly before 8 p.m., about 2.5 miles east-southeast of Summit Lake.Joint Base Lewis-McChord, which is jointly operated by the Army and Air Force, is about 10 miles south of Tacoma and home to around 40,000 active-duty troops.","Army MH-60 Black Hawk helicopter carrying four service members crashes near Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state.

US President Donald Trump ’s helicopter was forced into an unscheduled landing on Thursday after a hydraulic fault grounded Marine One during his return to Stansted Airport at the end of his state visit to Britain.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the incident was caused by a “minor hydraulic issue.” She said: “Out of an abundance of caution, the pilots landed at a local airfield before reaching Stansted Airport. The president and first lady safely boarded the support helicopter.”The diversion saw Marine One land at Luton, where emergency services were waiting on the tarmac. Images captured both Marine One and its twin, Marine Two, idling just off the runway.Marine One and its decoys are specially fitted “white tops” equipped with missile defence systems and radar-jamming technology. The aircraft are usually accompanied by Osprey MV-22s – known as “green tops” – carrying support staff, Secret Service agents and equipment for emergencies.The precaution came at the end of a trip marked by warmth between Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The pair signed a science and technology pact, welcomed £150 billion in fresh US investment, and discussed Ukraine, Gaza and tariffs.At Chequers, Trump said: “The bond between our countries is like no other anywhere in the world. The US and UK have done more good for the planet than any other nation in history.” Starmer responded that “time and time again, it is British and American men and women, side by side, changing the path of history.”The visit also featured pageantry from King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle. Trump praised them as “two fantastic people” and said he was “tremendously thankful” for their hospitality.No injuries were reported after the helicopter landing, and Trump departed Britain later that evening.","US President Donald Trump’s helicopter forced into an unscheduled landing on Thursday.

A man has died after riding a roller coaster at Universal Orlando Resort’s newly opened Epic Universe theme park. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that 32-year-old Kevin Rodriguez Zavala was found unresponsive on the Stardust Racers attraction on Wednesday and was transported to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.The medical examiner for Orange and Osceola counties, Joshua Stephany, determined the cause of death to be “multiple blunt impact injuries” and ruled the death an accident . No further details were given about the injuries. “We are devastated by this tragic event and extend our sincerest sympathies to the guest’s loved ones,” Universal Orlando Resort said in a statement. “We are fully cooperating with Orange County and the ongoing investigation.”Stardust Racers, described by the resort as “a breathtaking, dual-launch coaster reaching incredible speeds up to 62 mph,” was closed immediately after the incident on 17 September and has remained shut during the investigation. The ride, which opened with the park in May, features 5,000 feet of track and is one of Epic Universe’s main attractions.Industry experts have questioned the autopsy’s findings, with Dennis Speigel, CEO of International Theme Park Services, saying the conclusion was “pretty shocking” and raised more questions than it answered.“Was it the head or the chest?

"'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' row: Late-night host refused to apologise, reports say; planned to 'double down' on attacks against Trump’s MAGA base",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jimmy-kimmel-live-row-late-night-host-refused-to-apologise-reports-say-planned-to-double-down-on-attacks-against-trumps-maga-base/articleshow/123984901.cms,"FILE -- Jimmy Kimmel during a taping of ""Jimmy Kimmel Live""





Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel said he would not apologise for remarks blaming MAGA supporters for the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk — and instead planned to double down on his attacks against US President Donald Trump ’s backers before being pulled off the air, according to reports.Kimmel learned in a phone call from top Disney executive Dana Walden on Wednesday afternoon, after his Monday night monologue, that his show was being removed indefinitely, Deadline reported, citing sources.During the call, the 57-year-old host refused to apologise despite pressure from critics and from owners of dozens of affiliate stations of Disney-owned ABC, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Kimmel told executives he did not believe his remarks warranted an apology and maintained that his comments had been “misinterpreted.”Sources said Kimmel had been prepared to clarify his remarks on air, insisting he was referring to the “MAGA gang” for “desperately” trying to link accused gunman Tyler Robinson to left-wing ideology. Robinson, 22, has been indicted for the September 10 murder of Kirk at a university campus in Utah.Disney executives, however, feared that allowing Kimmel to double down on his MAGA comments would require a “more drastic decision” than simply suspending the show. The company also attracted criticism from Federal Communications Commission chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, whose “warning” was played a major role in ABC's decision to pull the programme off air.The move to suspend ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" has itself sparked widespread condemnation.","Kimmel learned in a phone call from top Disney executive Dana Walden on Wednesday afternoon, after his Monday night monologue.

President Trump said he doesn't know the UK ambassador to Washington who was fired by PM Keir Starmer last week over his relationship with pedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein, despite meeting him in the Oval Office four months ago. ""I don't know him, actually,"" Trump said when asked about Peter Mandelson's exit following an investigation which revealed the envoy's relationship with Epstein was deeper than previously known. ""I had heard that, and I think the PM would be better speaking on that - it was a choice that he made,"" Trump continued. Trump shook hands with Mandelson back in May when the US and UK announced a tariff agreement. The presser ended before anyone followed up on Trump's assertion.","President Trump said he doesn't know the UK ambassador to Washington who was fired over his relationship with pedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.
