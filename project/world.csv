"Irked by rally, Supreme Court threatens to cancel bail",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/irked-by-rally-supreme-court-threatens-to-cancel-bail/articleshow/112504924.cms,"Times View It has happened in the past that politicians accused of serious crimes have celebrated the occasion of being given bail like an acquittal. The apex court has rightly warned against over the top displays on such occasions.

NEW DELHI: Politicians , imprisoned for alleged crimes, are typically greeted by unruly celebrations by their supporters when they get bail, leading to inconvenience to the public. In what could be a cautionary tale for them, SC Tuesday took a serious view of the practice and threatened to cancel the bail it had granted to an alleged criminal of Maharashtra's Newasa for taking out a motorcade and getting showered with flowers by a JCB machine.Sopan Gade of Newasa faced several criminal cases, including a murder case of 2013. His bail plea in the murder case was rejected by trial court and Bombay HC bench at Aurangabad considering his criminal antecedents, absconding during pendency of trial and tactics to delay trial.On Tuesday, the complainant in the case, which related to murder of advocate Riyaz Pathan, complained before a bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan that days after SC granted bail considering that he has undergone almost a decade of incarceration, the accused roamed around Newasa town in a huge motorcade apparently to terrorise witnesses.Seeking cancellation of Sopan Gade's bail, complainant Asif Khan told SC that ""On Dec 16 last year, to create his fear among the people, Sopan organised a rally in his four-wheeler accompanied by 100 to 150 four-wheelers and 70 to 80 two-wheelers. It was telecast live on social media. They burst crackers, showered flowers from JCB to felicitate the accused. The motorcade caused a traffic jam on the NH for five to six hours.""The bench was furious and said it has become a habit with leaders to go around the town with supporters in a rally after getting bail. When Sopan's counsel said his supporters arranged the rally, the bench said, ""You file an apology for going in a motorcade and organising a rally. You also file an undertaking that you will never indulge in any such activities in future.""","Sopan Gade of Newasa faced several criminal cases, including a murder case of 2013.

CBI takes over

Doctors' body calls off strike

NEW DELHI: Following the Calcutta high court's order, the Central Bureau of Investigation took over the RG Kar Medical College rape-murder case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday. This case has placed significant scrutiny on the Mamata Banerjee-led government after a postgraduate trainee doctor was raped and murdered by a volunteer police worker.The agency promptly completed all necessary formalities within hours of the Calcutta High Court's order instructing the state police to transfer the case documents to the central probe agency.Meanwhile, Federation of resident doctors' association called off its strike after meeting Union minister JP Nadda.The controversy began when the victim's family revealed to the Metro that the hospital initially attempted to downplay the incident. The opposition criticised the Mamata government for forming an 11-member panel, which included interns, to investigate the case.Although Sanjay Ray was arrested with evidence and DNA tests linking him to the crime scene, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accused the West Bengal police of mishandling the investigationInvestigative details indicate that after committing the crime, Sanjay Ray returned to police barracks to sleep. Allegedly, Ray had unrestricted access to various rooms and wards in the hospital.The incident occurred after the victim and four colleagues shared a meal in the seminar room while watching the Olympics. Her colleagues left, and she remained in the room to study. At 3am, she was last seen asleep. Around 4am, the accused allegedly entered, sexually assaulted her, and strangled her when she resisted. Her body was discovered at 7.30am.Sanjay Ray, a civic volunteer with the Kolkata Police , was arrested on Saturday just six hours after a seven-member Special Investigation Team ( SIT ) was formed by the police force to investigate the case.On Sunday, the most damning evidence against Sanjay Ray, the primary suspect in the rape and murder of the 31-year-old doctor, was uncovered by investigators.""Traces of blood and skin found under the victim's fingernails perfectly matched Ray's DNA and corresponded to the injuries he sustained during the attack,"" a senior police officer stated. This evidence strongly links Ray to the heinous crime.The report concluded that the cause of death was smothering and throttling. The initial findings suggest that the victim died as a result of gagging, and there were numerous indications of injuries and struggle on the body. ""The mouth and throat were constantly pressed to prevent screaming.""Sanjay strangled the victim's throat to suffocate them, resulting in the fracture of the thyroid cartilage. The victim's face and eyes were stained with blood, and scratch marks were present on various parts of the body. Additionally, there was evidence of bleeding from the private parts, further indicating the violent nature of the attack.The Calcutta high court has directed Sandip Ghosh, the former principal of RG Kar Medical College, to submit a leave application by Tuesday at 3pm. Ghosh's appointment as the principal of Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata, which came immediately after his resignation, sparked protests.""How can the principal - who resigned by taking moral responsibility, be appointed as the principal of another government college? The court has asked him to submit a leave application by 3pm today or the court will pass an order for him to leave the position,"" the court observed.""Why are you protecting him? Record his statement. Let him tell whatever he knows,"" the court asked.The National Human Rights Commission on Tuesday took suo moto cognisance of the case. The commission observed that the contents of the media report, if true, raise a serious issue of violation of human rights of the victim. In response to the gravity of the situation, the commission has issued formal notices to the chief secretary and the director general of Police of West Bengal, requesting a comprehensive report on the incident within a period of two weeks.Representatives from the National Commission for Women went to the location where the crime occurred and spoke with the investigators and the victim's family members. The NCW strongly condemned the incident, describing it as ""heinous,"" and demanded that justice be served.In its direction to transfer the case to the CBI the Calcutta high court also urged the agitating doctors to call off their strike saying that they have a ""pious obligation"".Demonstrations broke out in various parts of India, with medical professionals calling for a thorough inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into recent incidents. Doctors at AIIMS Delhi, as well as hospitals in Mumbai and Nagpur, participated in the protests, urging authorities to take action and ensure better security measures for healthcare workers.The Federation of Resident Doctors' Association has resolved to continue its current indefinite strike after a fruitless discussion with officials from the Union health ministry in New Delhi.Union health minister JP Nadda met with the national president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) Dr R V Asokan.This came after the IMA expressed their shock and dismay in a letter addressed to Nadda, and put forth five demands:The IMA urged the government to declare hospitals as safe zones and define the entitlement of this term in the law. They also called for the establishment of police camps and adequate security personnel in all major government hospitals, with similar arrangements being made mandatory in large private hospitals. The association emphasized the need for compulsory installation of CCTV cameras at vulnerable points within healthcare facilities.The Central Bureau of Investigation has taken over the investigation into the incident. The agency promptly completed all necessary formalities within hours of the Calcutta High Court's order instructing the state police to transfer the case documents to the central probe agency.On Wednesday early morning, a team of CBI officials from Delhi, accompanied by forensic scientists and medical experts, will visit Kolkata.The federation of resident doctors association (Forda) also met Union health minister JP Nadda and called off the protests after getting assurance of free and fair trail of the matter.",The Central Bureau of Investigation took over the RG Kar Medical College rape- murder case.

Murder: Bilaspur court sentences man to death for murdering wife and three minor children in 'rarest of rare' case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bilaspur-court-sentences-man-to-death-for-murdering-wife-and-three-minor-children-in-rarest-of-rare-case/articleshow/112503893.cms,"RAIPUR: The trial court of Bilaspur has convicted 34-year-old Umend Kevat for the murder of his wife and three minor children , including his 18-month-old son Pawan Kevat, under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code , and has pronounced the death penalty for the accused, considering the case as one of the rarest of the rare. Suspecting his wife's character, the accused strangled Sukrita Kevat, 32, along with their daughters Khushi Kevat, 5, Lisa Kevat, 3, and son Pawan Kevat on January 1, 2024.“Given the severity of the crime, the accused's behavior does not warrant any leniency.The act of murdering his helpless wife and children in such a brutal manner makes this case one of the ' rarest of rare ' cases, which justifies the imposition of the death penalty,” the trial court stated.The tenth Additional Sessions Judge, Bilaspur, Avinash K Tripathi, said, “The court is of the view that a witness may lie, but circumstances do not. Circumstantial evidence forms the basis of rules and law. The accused, in this case, is solely responsible for the crime from which he cannot escape. The saying 'Actions Speak Louder Than Words' applies aptly to this case. The only conclusion is that no one else has committed the crime other than the accused, Umend Kevat.”Citing Supreme Court judgments in similar cases and the circumstances of this case, the court ruled that the accused's act of killing his family was nothing less than inhumane. The victims, including the children, were innocent and helpless. After a premeditated plan, the accused killed his wife and children one by one by strangling them with a rope, likely driven by doubts about his wife’s character.The accused first took his wife outside under the pretext of some work, strangled her from behind with a rope, and then returned to the room to kill his three children. This indicates that the accused was fully aware of his actions and their consequences. The manner in which these murders were carried out reflects a calculated and deliberate plan, leaving no room for doubt that this was an exceptionally heinous crime, the trial court noted.After thoroughly examining all the circumstances and arguments presented, the court rejected the plea for leniency and sentenced the accused to death under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, along with a fine of Rs 10,000. The court also ordered that the accused be hanged by the neck until death. This death sentence will remain subject to confirmation by the High Court as per Section 366 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.The trial court also observed that the impact of these murders is especially devastating for the surviving family members, particularly the elderly grandparents, whose only surviving relatives have now been taken from them. Given these circumstances, the court found no reason to show any leniency, concluding that Umend Kevat’s actions warrant the death penalty, which is in the best interest of society.","Umend Kevat, 34, convicted of murdering his wife and three minor children, including his 18-month-old son Pawan Kevat.

Exercise patience and judge us later — what we were able to do and what we couldn't.

A study conducted by the Wildlife Conservation Trust (WCT), in association with the Sahyadri Tiger Reserve and the forest of territorial circle of Kolhapur, has shown the presence of eight adult tigers , two cubs, 46 leopards and nine dhole packs in the Western Ghats .The corridor between the Sahyadri Tiger Reserve and newly declared Conservation Reserves of Maharashtra to the Kali Tiger Reserve of Karnataka, shares borders with the Mhadei, Mahavir, Netravali and Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuaries and the Mollem National Park of Goa, and the Bhimgad Wildlife Sanctuary.The study also assessed the first ever density estimates for tigers and leopards in the Conservation Reserves of Maharashtra and the relative abundance indices for wild prey species of gaur and sambar.The study has identified bottlenecks, crossing points and gaps for wild mammals along with the state and national highways passing through the conservation reserves and adjoining forests. It also highlighted the need of implementing mitigation measures, if expansion of these highways is undertaken. It has also set a baseline, which is vital to assess the impact of management actions or landscape change.“The corridor from the Sahyadri Tiger Reserve to the Kali Tiger Reserve is the only corridor that can allow movement of wildlife, including tigers to cross the landscape and plays key role in repopulating tigers in the Sahyadri Tiger Reserve,” said R M Ramanujan, principal conservation of forests (territory), Kolhapur, in the report.WCT president Anish Andhera said, “Protecting and monitoring the tiger corridor between Sahyadri and Kali Tiger Reserves are pivotal in improving the status of the tigers and other large mammals in this vast, multiple use landscape.”Wildlifer Girish Punjabi said, “Our collaborative research highlights why corridor connectivity is so crucial for large carnivores, especially for the tiger and sloth bear. With nearly 10 tigers in the Maharashtra corridor, and the connected tiger population of the Kali Tiger Reserve and the protected areas in Goa, we should see gradual colonisation by tigers up to the Sahyadri Tiger Reserve, which is located further north.”In the case of sloth bears, there are almost no bears in the corridor between Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary and Chandoli National Park, despite both the protected areas having reasonable populations. Therefore, any human development pressures in the corridor need to be minimised.”","Eight adult tigers, two cubs, 46 leopards and nine dhole packs in the Western Ghats.

The weapons delivery will take years to complete.In a notification to Congress, the state department announced the approval of a sale consisting of 50 F-15 fighter jets to Israel for $18.82 billion.Along with the jets, Israel will purchase nearly 33,000 tank cartridges, up to 50,000 explosive mortar cartridges, and new military cargo vehicles. The F-15 jets, equipped with advanced radar and secure communications gear, will significantly upgrade Israel's existing fleet when they begin arriving in 2029.""The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to US national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defence capability,"" the state department stated in its notice on the F-15s, which Boeing produces.Regarding the tank cartridges, the United States emphasised that the sale ""will improve Israel's capability to meet current and future enemy threats, strengthen its homeland defence, and serve as a deterrent to regional threats.""Congress retains the authority to block weapons sales, but doing so is challenging. Human rights groups and some progressive members of Biden's Democratic Party have urged the administration to halt arms sales to Israel, condemning the high number of civilian casualties in the Gaza conflict . Josh Paul, who resigned from the state department last year over Gaza policy, criticised Israel's actions.""Authorizing billions of dollars in new arms transfers effectively provides Israel a carte blanche to continue its atrocities in Gaza and to escalate the conflict to Lebanon,"" said Paul, who now works at the Middle East rights group, Dawn.Recently, rescuers in Gaza, controlled by Hamas , reported that 93 people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a school housing displaced Palestinians. Israel claimed it was targeting militants at the school. While Biden administration officials expressed concern over civilian deaths, they did not comment on whether US-supplied weapons were used in the strike.Earlier in May, Biden paused a shipment to Israel that included 2,000-pound bombs and cautioned against a large-scale assault on Rafah in southern Gaza, where many displaced Palestinians reside.However, the administration has not halted other weapons deliveries and dismissed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s complaints in June that the US was delaying shipments.The Gaza war initiated on October 7, when Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel, resulting in the deaths of 1,198 people, predominantly civilians, as per an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. Militants also captured 251 individuals, with 111 still held captive in Gaza, including 39 whom the military reports are deceased.Israel’s military response in Gaza has led to at least 39,929 deaths, according to the territory's health ministry, though the statistics do not specify the number of civilians versus militants killed.In a recent address to Congress, which was boycotted by numerous Democrats, Netanyahu urged the US to expedite military aid, arguing that it would ""dramatically expedite an end to the war in Gaza.""","50 F-15 fighter jets, 33,000 tank cartridges, up to 50,000 explosive mortar cartridges, and new military cargo vehicles will be delivered to Israel in 2029.

How case unfolded

Former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Faiz Hameed was arrested by Pakistan military in connection to a housing scheme scandal and the process for his court martial was initiated, the army said on Monday.It is for the first time in the country's history that court martial has been initiated against a former intelligence chief, according to Dawn .“Complying with the orders of Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry, was undertaken by Pakistan Army, to ascertain correctness of complaints in Top City case made against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd),” a press statement by Pakistan army said further adding that ""the process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated and Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) has been taken into military custody.”“Consequently, appropriate disciplinary action has been initiated against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), under provisions of Pakistan Army Act,” the release further said.Hameed was regarded as close aide to Imran Khan, who appointed him to lead the ISI during his tenure as prime minister. Khan was removed from office in 2022 through a vote of no-confidence, which he claims was orchestrated by the military, though the military denies this allegation.In 2022, Hameed was one of the six senior-most generals whose names were forwarded by general headquarters to Pakistani prime minister Shehbaz Sharif for consideration for the two top military positions. He, however, chose to seek early retirement and submitted his resignation to the high command, as per sources.The Supreme Court, in its order dated November 14 last year, had said that the allegations against Hameed were of ""extremely serious nature"" and ""would undermine the reputation of the federal government, the armed forces, ISI and Pakistan Rangers, therefore, they cannot be left unattended.”This came after the management of Top City, a private housing scheme, made allegations against the former spy-master, accusing him of orchestrating a raid on the offices and residence of its owner, Moeez Khan.The petition was filed on May 12, 2017, and it said that Pakistan Rangers and ISI officials conducted a raid on Top City's office and Moeez’s residence, seizing valuables such as gold and diamond jewelry and money in connection with an alleged terrorism case, Dawn reported.It also alleged the involvement of former ISI officials Irtaza Haroon, Sardar Najaf, Wasim Tabish, Zahid Mehmood Malik, and Mohammad Munir ""in the illegal takeover of the housing society”.In March, a court placed retired naib tehsildar Najaf Hameed, Hameed's brother, under a 14-day judicial remand.Najaf and other co-accused had sought pre-arrest bail in an FIR filed with the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) in Rawalpindi.The FIR alleged that former minister for mineral resources Hafiz Ammar Yasir had acquired properties worth billions of rupees through intermediaries.In April, the military had reportedly established an inquiry committee to investigate allegations of authority misuse involving the former ISI head.","Former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Faiz Hameed was arrested by Pakistan military in connection to a housing scheme scandal.

However, after Biden's unexpected withdrawal from the race, Trump questioned the validity of that commitment with Harris, leading to uncertainty over whether the debate would take place.Recent events, including Biden's exit and an assassination attempt on Trump, have drawn renewed attention to the presidential race, which had initially been shaping up as a repeat of the 2020 election. The upcoming ABC debate is expected to serve as a critical moment in the campaign's final stretch leading up to the election.Trump has also indicated his willingness to engage in additional debates with Harris, proposing events hosted by NBC News and Fox News. However, the Harris campaign has not yet agreed to these additional debates.

However, the quota system was reinstated this year, triggering further protests that ultimately led to the toppling of the government and the prime minister's exile.The former presidential candidate also highlighted the concerning trend of radicals targeting Hindu minorities amidst the chaos. He emphasized that ""bloodshed is the endpoint of grievance and victimhood"" and suggested that the United States should learn from the lessons unfolding in Bangladesh.""Here's what happened: Bangladesh fought a bloody war for its independence in 1971. Hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi civilians were raped and murdered. It was a tragedy, and it was rightly mourned. But in its aftermath, Bangladesh implemented a quota system for jobs in their civil service: 80% of the jobs were allocated to specific social groups (war veterans, rape victims, underrepresented residents, etc.), and only 20% were allocated based on merit,"" he said in a post on X.""The quota system proved to be a disaster. In 2018, protests led Bangladesh to scrap most of the quotas, but the victim-patrons fought back…and the quota system was reinstated this year. That triggered more protests which toppled the government, and the prime minister fled. Once chaos begins, it can't easily be reined in. Radicals are now targeting Hindu minorities. A quota conflict created to rectify the wrongs of rape and violence in 1971 is now leading to more rape and violence in 2024. Bloodshed is the endpoint of grievance and victimhood. It's hard not to look at Bangladesh and wonder what lessons we would do well to learn right here at home,"" he added.Since the ousting of Sheikh Hasina's government on August 5, Bangladesh has been experiencing a volatile political situation. According to reports from two Hindu organizations in the country, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad, members of minority communities in Bangladesh have faced at least 205 incidents of attacks across 52 districts.

Here's a look at Howard's history and influence in American academia and polity.Howard was founded in 1867 in Washington, DC, and named after General Oliver Otis Howard, head of the post-Civil War Freedmen's Bureau, who got the US Congress to appropriate funds for the school.The university is largely supported and funded by the American govt but is privately controlled. After being established, the university's main goal was to provide quality higher education for blacks, although it has always been open to students of any race and colour.Howard played a crucial role in the American civil rights movement. Alain Locke, chair of Howard's department of philosophy, authored the seminal work The New Negro (1925) - an anthology of essays and poetry on African-American art and literature - that helped spur the Harlem Renaissance. It was at Howard in the 1940s that students pioneered protest tactics like 'stool-sitting' where they would occupy stools in local cafeterias that denied service to African-Americans. The term "" Black Power "" is also believed to have been coined at Howard by Stokely Carmichael.Given Howard's influence in black polity and society, it has over the years attracted heavy-weight American politicians. Calvin Coolidge was the first sitting US prez to speak at Howard in 1924. In 1965, then president Lyndon B Johnson outlined his plans for civil rights legislation to the graduating class in Howard when the voting rights bill was still pending in the US Congress. All of this has made Howard the creme de la creme of HBCUs.Howard boasts of a long list of graduates who went on to achieve influential positions in education, society and governance. These include senator Edward William Brooke, playwright Amiri Baraka, Nobel laureates Ralph Bunche and Toni Morrison. Kamala Harris, on becoming vice-president, became the first Howard and HBCU graduate to hold the office.In 1975, Jeanne Sinkford became the first female dean of any American dental school when she was appointed as the dean of Howard University's school of dentistry.Previously known as Freedmen's Hospital, it has served the African-American community in the Washington metropolitan area since 1862. Howard University Hospital is the only teaching hospital located on the campus of an HBCU.The oldest black sorority of which Harris is a member, Alpha Kappa Alpha (AKA) was founded in 1908 at Howard as a support network for black women. AKA is also one of the 'Divine Nine' or the 'Pan-Hellenic Council' - the most powerful Black sororities in US. AKA is a huge force for Harris, having mobilised campaign funds and voters when Biden picked Harris as his VP nominee in 2020. It can be counted on to do the same this time for Harris's presidential bid.","Howard was founded in 1867 in Washington, DC, and named after General Oliver Otis Howard, head of the post-Civil War Freedmen's Bureau.

Probably, right? So she can win by three of four?

But he never really came back to Twitter and continued posting on Truth Social.Trump and Musk engaged in a long conversation covering a wide range of subjects and tilting to rant.Donald Trump talked at a length about the assassination bid on him at Pennsylvania. ""If I hadn't turned my head, I would not be talking to you right now, as much as I like you,"" he said.On the assassination bid issue, Elon Musk pointed out that Trump turned his head to see a slide and it was on illegal immigration. “Illegal immigration saved my life, you’re right,” Trump said and the two men laughed.""If you have a contagious disease, I'm sorry, but we cannot allow you into the country. So we were setting literally records. And all I was doing is showing that,"" Trump said talking about the chart.""She's (Kamala) the border czar. And she never even went there.

He didn't wanna leave. And they said, we can do it the nice way, or we can do it the hard way.""""So I had a good relationship with Putin, despite the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax that lasted for over two years, just a hoax created by Hillary Clinton and Adam Shifty Schiff, some just bad people, just sick people, frankly. I mean, Schiff is a sick person. He's gonna end up probably being a senator. But I know Putin very well. I got along with him very well. He respected me.""""Elon, I know every one of them and I know them well. I know Putin, I know President Xi. I know Kim Jong-un of North Korea. I know every one of them.

Whether they love their country, they probably do.""""It's just a different form of love, but they're gonna protect their country. But these are tough people at the top of their game. And when they see a Kamala, or when they see Biden, Sleepy Joe, they can't even believe it.""""And we're in a very bad position and I'm not gonna blame exclusively, but I can tell you I could have stopped that and a smart president could have stopped that. It wouldn't have happened. But we had a man that actually made it more prevalent. It was so bad. The words that he was using, the stupid threats coming from a stupid face that he was using.

And you see tonight, I mean, as we're doing this, I'm seeing reports coming that they expect an attack tonight or tomorrow from hundreds and maybe thousands of rockets. You know, their Iron Dome, as they call it, as we all call it, but their shield that they built, that can be swamped.""""Now, you know Chairman Xi very well. Can you imagine her and him negotiating, or even standing together? It is, the whole concept is ridiculous. She is terrible. She's terrible. But she's getting a free ride. I saw a picture of her on Time Magazine today. She looks like the most beautiful actress ever to live. It was a drawing. And actually, she looked very much like a great first lady, Melania.

Pakistan govt accuses ISI ex-chief of political interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-govt-accuses-isi-ex-chief-of-political-interference/articleshow/112504585.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement. Asif’s statement came hours after the military announced Hameed’s arrest, saying field court martial proceedings had been initiated against him.Speaking to a private news channel, Asif accused the retired general of violating the Army Act by interfering in politics in Dec 2022.The act bars officials from engaging in political activity for two years after retirement. “Gen Faiz was definitely involved in the events that took place in the political scene post his retirement,” the minister said.When asked about Hameed’s involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots by alleged supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, the minister said, “He might have provided a little bit of logistics and provided his experience of conspiracies, and may have defined targets for protesters to inflict maximum damage,” adding, “You can say he might have had the role of a strategic adviser in the May 9 attacks.”Following Imran’s brief arrest in a graft case last year, his supporters had attacked and damaged government and military assets. Hundreds of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers and politicians were arrested after the riots. Some still remain behind bars. The military has also initiated army court trials against more than 100 people accused of involvement in the May 9, 2023 violence.Gen Hameed’s arrest has sparked widespread speculation, with many linking the move to his close ties with Imran who has demanded the formation of a judicial commission to probe the ex-spymaster’s arrest to check if it was linked to the May 9 events.Many politicians accused Gen Hameed of using harsh methods and coercive techniques while serving as ISI chief to please his military and political superiors and achieve his own personal goals. Former PM Nawaz Sharif has repeatedly claimed that Hameed, a number of Supreme Court judges, and former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa were responsible for his ouster in 2017. Hameed was then leading an ISI wing concerned with domestic issues.Gen Hameed had replaced General Asim Munir, the current army chief, as ISI director-general in 2019. Gen Munir was unceremoniously fired by Imran when the latter was PM. The rivalry between these three individuals is partly to blame for Pakistan’s current political turmoil.As the spy agency’s head Gen Hameed had used his authority to threaten and detain Imran’s political rivals, including former PMs, on what they claimed were false accusations. He was seen by opposition politicians as a spy chief who had managed PTI’s past govt activities from behind the scenes.Both Hameed and Imran had approved the policy of repatriating Pakistani Taliban militants from Afghanistan back to Pakistan, which critics claim has led to the return of militancy to Pakistan. Hameed has also been perceived as a supporter of the Afghan Taliban, having backed their takeover of Kabul following the American withdrawal in Aug 2021.In Oct 2021, Gen Bajwa had removed Hameed as spy chief, prompting Khan to oppose the move before eventually agreeing. As a PM, Imran had publicly acknowledged that he wanted to retain Hameed as ISI chief because of the situation in Afghanistan.","Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement.

Hameed has also been accused of multiple violations of the Pakistan Army Act after retirement.“Complying with the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by the Pakistan Army to ascertain the correctness of complaints in the Top City (housing society) case made against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd),” the military said in a statement.The management of Top City had accused the former ISI chief of orchestrating a raid on its offices and residence of its owner, Moeez Khan. As per the petition, filed in May 2017, Pakistan Rangers and ISI officials had taken away valuables, including gold and diamond ornaments and money, in connection with a purported terrorism case.Consequently, according to ISPR, appropriate disciplinary action has been initiated against Hameed under provisions of the Pakistan Army Act.“In addition, multiple instances of violation of Pakistan Army Act post-retirement have also been established,” the statement said.Hameed came into the global spotlight when he was filmed drinking tea in the lobby of a Kabul hotel shortly after the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 2021, forcing the former ruler, Ashraf Ghani, to flee.His transfer out of his ISI post had become a bone of contention between the former PM and the then army chief, Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, which ultimately ended in Imran’s ouster from office in April 2022. Hameed had sought early retirement from the army in Nov 2022.Hameed was among the six senior-most army generals who were nominated by General HQ as a potential candidate for the two top military offices, chief of army staff (COAS) and chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC).

"Pakistan's battle with polio eradication: Infant succumbs in Balochistan, total cases rise to 14 this year",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-battle-with-polio-eradication-infant-succumbs-in-balochistan-total-cases-rise-to-14-this-year/articleshow/112441087.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan continues to grapple with cases of polio with the country along with neighbouring Afghanistan being the only two countries in the world where the poliovirus is still an endemic.On August 10, the 14th polio case of the year was reported from Qilla Saifullah district of Balochistan boosting the number of poliovirus cases in the country to 13 for the year 2024.The country has reported three more cases- two in Balochistan and one in Punjab province.Since 2015, Pakistan has reported a total of 362 polio cases, as per a report in Al Jazeera.However, despite administering more than 300 million doses of oral vaccine annually with the help of at least 350,000 vaccinators and an expenditure of over USD 9.3 bn from 2013 to 2023, the country has been unable to eradicate polio, the Qatar-based publication said.The highly infectious Polio disease has no or mild symptoms and can cause paralysis of the limbs. Polio is transmitted through contaminated water or food, or contact with an infected person. Treatment includes bed rest, pain relievers, rehabilitation and portable ventilators.Dr Hamid Jafari, WHO 's regional director of polio eradication was cited by Al-Jazeera as saying that the challenge exists in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. ""This is where there's a lot of militancy, insecurity and community hostility and frustration towards the government because of conflict and a lack of services,"" Jafari said.Over 50 districts across Pakistan are detecting the virus, he said.Compounding to the challenges is the fact, says the WHO official that not only is the polio programme being targeted but also security personnel that are guarding the teams ""because they become soft targets when they are in the community.""At least 102 polio field workers, officials and security personnel have been killed, including at least six in campaigns carried out this year, the Al Jazeera report cited.Meanwhile, the latest victim is an 11-month-old infant from Qila, in Balochistan who has succumbed to paralysis caused by the wild poliovirus.The child from Qila who displayed symptoms of paralysis on July 17, is among the five cases detected in the district. Other cases in Balochistan have been reported in Chaman, Quetta, Zhob, Dera Bugti, and Jhal Magsi as per a report in the Balochistan Post.In Balochistan, the situation is compounded by a recent history of inadequate vaccination coverage and persistent misconceptions about the vaccine. Despite numerous vaccination campaigns, efforts have struggled to keep pace with the actual number of infections, the publication stated.","On August 10, the 14th polio case of the year was reported from Qilla Saifullah district of Balochistan boosting the number of poliovirus cases in the country to 13 for the year 2024.
