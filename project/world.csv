PITHORAGARH/DEHRADUN: Several members of a right-wing group along with a few local residents held a protest rally and a sit-in, demanding the demolition of what they described as an “illegal mosque” in Berinag area of Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand. They claimed the mosque was built “unlawfully inside a house and should be removed”.The latest incident took place amid ongoing tension over a similar situation in Uttarkashi town over a fortnight ago along.Soon after Saturday’s rally, Berinag’s SDM Srestha Gunsola issued summons to Abdul Nazim, who purportedly owns the house where the mosque is situated, seeking “clarification regarding the status of the building”.The SDM claimed the land ownership case is currently pending in the court of Pithoragarh additional district magistrate. Gunsola said the house originally belonged to Abdul Mazid, who later moved to Haldwani, where he passed away. Its ownership was then passed to his son, Nazim, and the summons were issued.The SDM added: “He has been given 15 days to respond to the summons.” The protest rally was held by ‘Rashtriya Sewa Sangh’., which alleged that the house owned by a member of the minority community was “illegally converted into a religious place in which fellow members were visiting in large groups to offer namaz”.",Members of a right-wing group along with a few local residents held a protest rally and a sit-in.

Manipur violence: Indefinite curfew imposed in Jiribam district following intense gunfight with militants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/manipur-violence-indefinite-curfew-imposed-in-jiribam-district-following-intense-gunfight-with-militants/articleshow/115189642.cms,"11 militants killed in gunfight with security forces in Manipur

NEW DELHI: An indefinite curfew has been imposed across the entire Jiribam district, effective immediately, in response to escalating violence and to maintain order, as confirmed by Manipur authorities. This measure follows a deadly clash between suspected militants and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in the Jakurador Karong area of Borobekra sub-division.On Monday afternoon, eleven suspected militants were killed in a fierce firefight with CRPF personnel after the armed assailants launched an assault, setting fire to local shops and homes and attacking a nearby CRPF camp. The militants initiated the attack on Borobekra police station around 2:30 p.m., then advanced towards the Jakurador Karong area, escalating tensions in a region already affected by recent clashes.Two CRPF personnel were injured in the exchange of fire, with one in critical condition who was evacuated to Silchar Medical College in Assam for urgent treatment. According to officials, the firefight lasted approximately 40 to 45 minutes, during which security forces retaliated heavily to bring the situation under control.In a post on X, the Manipur Police shared details of the incident, stating, “The CRPF Post located at Jakuradhor and Borobekra Police Station (located nearby), Jiribam District were attacked by armed militants. The security forces retaliated strongly.” The post also mentioned that following the gunfight, the bodies of ten militants, along with weapons including AK-47 rifles, SLRs, and an RPG, were recovered from the site.Authorities are investigating reports of five civilians who remain unaccounted for. It is unclear if they were abducted or went into hiding amidst the violence. The bodies of the slain militants were taken to Borobekra police station for identification and investigation.The attack underscores the ongoing tension in Manipur, where violence has surged in recent months. Jiribam has seen frequent skirmishes since violence first erupted in June, leaving communities on edge. Last week, the killing of a 31-year-old woman in Zairon Hmar village added to these tensions, and clashes across the region have continued despite efforts to restore order.Manipur’s Director General of Police (DGP) Rajiv Singh emphasized the government’s commitment to peace, citing cooperation with security forces and local communities to address these ""challenging times."" He noted a reduction in violence since the ethnic tensions began on May 3, 2023, after protests led by the All Tribal Students Union (ATSU) sparked widespread unrest over Meitei community demands for Scheduled Tribe status.Efforts toward peace were made recently when leaders from the Kuki, Meitei, and Naga communities engaged in dialogue in New Delhi. The Ministry of Home Affairs facilitated the discussions, bringing together MLAs and ministers who jointly called for unity and peace, marking a crucial step toward healing and stability in Manipur.","An indefinite curfew has been imposed across the entire Jiribam district, effective immediately.

Kerala government suspends IAS officers K Gopalakrishnan and N Prasanth for creating religion-based WhatsApp group,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kerala-government-suspends-ias-officers-k-gopalakrishnan-and-n-prasanth-for-creating-religion-based-whatsapp-group/articleshow/115188944.cms,"IAS officers K Gopalakrishnan and N Prasanth

NEW DELHI: The Kerala government on Monday suspended two IAS officers , K Gopalakrishnan and N Prasanth , for alleged breaches of conduct. According to official sources, Gopalakrishnan was suspended for creating a religion-based WhatsApp group , while disciplinary action was taken against Prasanth for reportedly criticizing a senior officer.The controversy began on October 31, when several IAS officers in the Kerala cadre were unexpectedly added to a new WhatsApp group named "" Mallu Hindu Officers ."" The group, allegedly created by K Gopalakrishnan, included only Hindu officers, prompting immediate objections. Many officers viewed the group as a breach of the secular values that government officials are expected to uphold, and the group was deleted the following day.In response, Gopalakrishnan claimed his phone had been hacked, resulting in the unauthorized formation of several WhatsApp groups using his contacts. He filed a police complaint , asserting that he had no involvement in creating the controversial group.The incident follows another high-profile controversy involving IPS officer MR Ajith Kumar, who was recently transferred from his role as ADGP (law and order). Kumar reportedly met with senior RSS leaders without the approval of Kerala’s ruling LDF government, which faced mounting pressure to act after the CPI, an LDF ally, took a strong stance on the issue. While the government has not officially confirmed this as the reason for his transfer, the timing has raised questions.“This is the first time a WhatsApp group among officers has been created based on religious lines,” a senior officer told The Times of India, speaking on condition of anonymity. Typically, WhatsApp groups among officials are based on seniority, department, or regional ties, he explained, adding that most are inactive or serve practical, administrative functions.The formation of a group with a religious angle drew the attention of state and central intelligence agencies , who were alerted by officers added to the group. Evidence provided by these officers reportedly led intelligence authorities to take the matter seriously, and an investigation is now underway.","K Gopalakrishnan was suspended for creating a religion-based WhatsApp group. disciplinary action was taken against Prasanth for reportedly criticizing a senior officer.

Security forces gunned down 10 “armed militants” in Manipur’s Jiribam district Monday in swift retaliation to two CRPF posts coming under attack around 3pm, capping days of attacks by suspected tribal gunmen on civilian targets in one of the flashpoints of the ethnic strife.Sanjeev Kumar, a CRPF constable wounded in the militant assault, was airlifted to Silchar Medical College in neighbouring Assam, while two civilians were “unaccounted for” after the tumult of gunfire from both sides, sources said.Manipur Police, which joined CRPF in the largest counter-offensive against suspected militants in recent months, said three Kalashnikov rifles, four SLRs, two INSAS rifles, an RPG, a pump-action gun, bullet-proof helmets, and magazines were found beside the bodies of the militants.The tribal Kuki-Zo council disputed the number of casualties cited by police, saying “about 11 village volunteers died at the hands of CRPF personnel”. It declared a total shutdown in the area from 5am to 6pm Tuesday “in honour of the victims and to express our collective grief and solidarity for those who were brutally shot dead”. Hmar Students’ Association, too, denounced what it alleged was “the brutal murder of 11 Hmar village volunteers”.A security mop-up was underway till late Monday in the vicinity of Jakuradhor and Borobekra police stations, to which the CRPF posts were attached. Reinforcements from the Assam Rifles, CRPF and police have been dispatched to the site, officials said.The Hmar association said the “11 village volunteers” killed in the CRPF-police offensive were from Jakhradawr in Jiribam. “They were captured, herded together and murdered by combined forces under the influence of Meitei militants. This premeditated massacre of Hmar village volunteers who were protecting their villages is an alarming escalation in the ongoing conflict in Manipur, specifically targeting the Hmar community.”The statement demanded a CBI investigation and immediate withdrawal of CRPF and Manipur Police from the area.The administration clamped prohibitory orders under Section 163 of the BNSS in the district.Last Thursday, a 31-year-old tribal woman was allegedly raped by armed intruders and burned alive in her home in Zairon Hmar village of Jiribam. Two days later, a woman working in a paddy field was gunned down in neighbouring Bishnupur district. Suspected militants again attacked farmers in Imphal East Sunday.

BHOPAL: A supari of Rs 2.5 lakh was given for the contract killing of paroled murder convict Jaswant Singh Gill in Gwalior on Nov 7, police said Monday after identifying the two shooters as Navjot Singh and Amalpreet Singh — henchmen of pro-Khalistan extremist Arshdeep Singh Gill alias Arsh Dalla .The alleged gunmen were caught by Punjab Police in another case Sunday and were later found to be connected to the Gwalior murder. “We are trying to get them here on transit remand,” Gwalior SP Dharmvir Singh told TOI.According to investigators, Navjot and Amalpreet had arrived in Gwalior on the morning of the murder and were identified from Aadhaar cards they had given at a hotel in Tekanpur near Gwalior. The hit was paid for by Satpal Singh, Canada-based brother of Gwalior’s Sukhwinder Singh, Gill’s maternal uncle whom he had shot dead in 2016. Satpal offered the supari to Dalla in Canada, police said.Six months ago, Satpal and his parents members had visited Gwalior from Canada when they learnt that Gill had been out multiple times on parole. It was at this point that Satpal decided to take revenge, police said. The shooters were told to empty an entire magazine into Gill’s chest, but the pistol jammed and the shooter could get off three shots, killing Gill on the spot.The shooters then fled to Mohali, 600km from Gwalior, in a luxury taxi hired from Canada. The taxi was tracked via toll booth records and the payment was traced to Satpal, cops said, adding that the cabbie was detained to ascertain if he was part of conspiracy.Intelligence officers said Arsh Dalla, who is allegedly associated with the banned Khalistan Tiger Force and ran terror modules for terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar (killed in June last year), was recently arrested in Ontario in connection with a shooting case.

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

A former police officer and national security hardliner who crafted a controversial policy to separate parents and children to deter illegal immigration during Donald Trump's first term will be his ""Deporter-in-Chief"" during his second stint.The President-elect on Sunday announced that Tom Homan, an immigration hawk with a fearsome reputation among liberals will be his ""Border Czar"" to oversee what Trump has proposed will be ""the largest deportation of illegal immigrants in US history.""""I've known Tom for a long time, and there is nobody better at policing and controlling our Borders...he will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin... I have no doubt he will do a fantastic, and long awaited job,"" Trump announced in a social media post.Homan was promoted to acting Director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during Trump's first term and came to national attention with policies civil liberties activists saw as brutal and inhuman. They included forcibly separating parents from children in an effort to curtail illegal immigration.“Most parents don’t want to be separated,” Homan explained in one interview, arguing that this made separation an effective tool for immigration enforcement . “I’d be lying to you if I didn’t think that would have an effect,"" he added.Since then, he has become a legend in MAGA circles for his take-no-prisoners approach to immigration, including denying birthright citizenship to children born in the US to illegal immigrants, a right granted by the US Constitution's 14th Amendment.In a recent 60 Minutes interview, Homan supported deporting U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants, stating, “Families can be deported together.” Another time, he said, “No one’s off the table. If you’re in the country illegally, you better be looking over your shoulder.” About the illegals, he once said, ""You better start packing now... cause you're going home.""In more accommodating moments, Homan has said only illegal immigrants have to be fearful. ""I hear a lot of people say, 'The talk of a mass deportation is racist. It's threatening to the immigrant community,'"" he said, maintaining the only threat is to the illegal immigrant community.Homan joined the Heritage Foundation in February 2022 and was a contributor to its Project 2025, which proposes mass arrests, detentions and deportations of undocumented immigrants across America. He has also proposed that politicians who support sanctuary city policies -- who are mostly Democrats who have a more nuanced and liberal view of illegal immigrants -- should be charged with crimes.Homan's nomination, which will have to confirmed by the Senate, was long-anticipated and he himself booked the spot, telling, a July 2024 National Conservatism Conference meeting, ""If Trump comes back in January, I'll be on his heels coming back, and I will run the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen. They ain't seen shit yet. Wait until 2025.""Trump's nomination of Homan as a border firefighter was greeted with horror by the liberal-progressive spectrum. ""Tom Homan is not human. At the border, he gleefully separated children from their parents and then caged them. He sees all of them as less than human, far below the level of rabbits and feral chickens. He's cruel,"" read one post on social media.","Tom Homan, an immigration hawk with a fearsome reputation among liberals will be his ""Border Czar"" to oversee what Trump has proposed will be ""the largest deportation of illegal immigrants in US history"" Homan was promoted to acting Director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during Trump's first term.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115184818,imgsize-1076262,width-400,resizemode-4/115184818.jpg"

Why Tom Homan is called the father of 'family separation'



President-elect Donald Trump's 'Border Czar' Tom Homan Monday said he would boot millions of migrants from the US according to Trump's plan. He said he does not care what people think of him and especially the Left. “I don’t care what anybody’s opinions like illegal immigration. When you create a crisis this big, all these other bad things happen. That’s what we have to secure the border,"" Tom Homan said on Fox & Friends.“I’ve been clear. President Trump’s been clear. Public safety threats and national security threats will be the priority because they have to be, they pose the most danger in this country,” he said.MAGA supporters are celebrating Tom Homan's no-nonsense stance on immigration and how he would rein in the border mayhem. The video of Homan shutting AOC and Pramila Jayapal are doing the rounds.Homan told Fox that he was prepared to do anything to fix the Biden administration's crisis. “I’ve been on this network for years complaining about what this administration did to this border. I’ve been yelling and screaming about it and what they need to do to fix it. So when the president asked me, ‘Would you come back and fix it?’ Of course. I’d be a hypocrite if I didn’t,” he told the outlet.“I’m honored the president asked me to come back and help solve this national security crisis, so I’m looking forward to it.”“I think the calling is clear. I’ve got to go back and help because every morning… I’m pissed off with what this [Biden] administration did to the most secure border in my lifetime, so I’m going to go back and do what I can to fix it,"" Homan said.Tom Homan was the acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement between 2017 and 2018. He was one of the key architects of the ""zero tolerance"" family separation policy during that time. He advocated for separating the immigrant families sending the parents to immigration court for removal proceedings and children to the care of a separate agency. ""Their parent absolutely entered the country illegally, had a child knowing he was in the country illegally. So he created that crisis,"" Homan said earlier doubling down on his policy.","Tom Homan was the acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement between 2017 and 2018.

Height of all children of Donald Trump

The surprising height of 18-year-old Barron Trump again became the internet's talking point after Donald Trump's return to the White House was smoothly sealed in a comfortable projected margin against vice president Kamala Harris.Barron Trump spent his childhood in the White House and the White House will again get to see a lot of 6'9'' Barron -- as this time he was his father's unofficial social media adviser. Barron is Trump's youngest son with Melania and is studying Business at New York University. Barron will not be a permanent resident of the White House as he will stay in New York for his college and Melania too is unlikely to shift her base to Washington from New York full time.All the Trumps are tall including Melania but Barron's height is shocking and he clearly dominates the room he's in. His father did not miss a chance to speak about his height every time he appeared on a podcast as he also mentioned how smart Barron is and how he knows a lot about the internet, cryptocurrency etc.Barron, the youngest of Donald Trump’s children, was born to Donald and Melania on March 20, 2006. Interestingly, Trump personally chose Barron’s name, revealing on The Oprah Winfrey Show that he had “always loved the name” but initially hesitated to use it.Donald Trump is believed to be 6 feet 2 inches tall and Melania is 5 feet 9 inches. It's no wonder that Barron is so tall but Donald Trump thinks it had something to do with the food that Melania's mother Amalija Knavs cooked. ""Boy, did she take care of Barron. That’s how he got so tall – he only ate her food,"" Trump explained earlier.Donald Trump Jr: 6 feetEric Trump. 6 feet 4 inchesTiffany Trump: 5 feet 6 inchesIvanka Trump: 5 feet 9 inchesBarron Trump: 6 feet 9 inches","Barron Trump, 18, is the youngest of Donald and Melania's children.

A 37-year-old Irish man was arrested in Hungary in connection with the murder of Mackenzie Michalski, a 31-year-old American nurse from Portland, Oregon, Hungarian police announced on Saturday. Michalski, who had been vacationing in Budapest, was reported missing on November 5 after a night out in the city.Authorities identified the suspect, who police referred to by the initials L.T.M., through security footage from a local nightclub, which showed Michalski and the man interacting before heading to his rented apartment. Officials stated that the suspect later confessed to the killing, claiming it was accidental, but attempted to cover it up by concealing Michalski’s body.According to police, Michalski and the suspect met at a nightclub in Budapest, where they were seen dancing together before moving to the suspect’s apartment. Officers reported that she was killed during an ""intimate encounter,"" though further details were not provided.To hide Michalski’s body, police said the suspect placed it in a wardrobe while cleaning his apartment to remove evidence of the incident. He then purchased a suitcase, placed her body inside, and rented a car to transport it to a wooded area near the village of Szigliget, about 90 miles from Budapest. In a video released by police, the suspect, in handcuffs, is seen leading investigators to the location where he had hidden Michalski’s body, with sniffer dogs and forensic specialists aiding in the search.The suspect reportedly made a series of online searches following the killing, including phrases like, “what does a dead body smell like after it decomposes?” and “how do the police handle missing person cases?” Police also reported he searched whether pigs eat dead bodies and researched wild boar populations near Lake Balaton, a body of water close to where he had disposed of Michalski’s body. He also allegedly searched about the competence of Budapest police.A Facebook group titled “Find Mackenzie Michalski,” created on November 7, confirmed Michalski’s death in a post, expressing gratitude for the ""prompt attention, diligence, care, and consideration"" of US and Hungarian authorities. A vigil was held near the US Embassy in Budapest on Saturday to honour Michalski, who was described by friends as a nurse practitioner known for her “humor, positivity, and limitless empathy.”Michalski’s parents have reportedly traveled to Hungary following the news. Hungarian police have remanded the suspect in custody as investigations continue.","Mackenzie Michalski, a 31-year-old nurse from Portland, Oregon, was reported missing on November 5 after a night out in Budapest.

Seven deadly wins: Trump takes Arizona for a clean sweep of the battleground states,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/seven-deadly-wins-trump-takes-arizona-for-a-clean-sweep-of-the-battleground-states/articleshow/115144912.cms,"Donald Trump (File photo)

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

MAGA supremo Donald Trump has flipped Arizona, the last state to officially declare results on Saturday to sweep all seven battleground states in the 2024 presidential election . With this, Trump has chalked up 312 electoral votes to Kamala Harris ' 226 to complete a remarkable win, reversing his loss to Biden in 2020, when the outgoing President won 306-232.Trump has won 74.6 million votes (50.5 per cent) to Harris' 71 million (48 per cent) so far, with some votes still to be counted, to win by around 2.5 per cent popular votes nationwide, attesting to a still divided national despite his seemingly sweeping win. Harris has polled 10 million fewer votes than Joe Biden 's 81 million in 2020, leading to much handwringing and soul-searching among Democrats still trying to figure out if and why so many Democratic voters bailed out on Kamala Harris despite visible enthusiasm on the ground.Conspiracy theorists are still kvetching about elections that were ""stolen,"" with the hashtag ""cheated"" trending on social media amid suspicions that there was some jiggery-pokery to boost Trump's tally. MAGA principals on the other hand say the only cheating occurred in 2020 when Biden logged a fantastic 81 million votes, nearly 15 million more votes than Hillary Clinton got in 2016.The President-elect trolled Democrats for their loss despite a massive financial advantage with the Harris campaign raising more than $ 1 billion for the elections. ""I am very surprised that the Democrats, who fought a hard and valiant fight in the 2020 Presidential Election, raising a record amount of money, didn’t have lots of $’s left over. Now they are being squeezed by vendors and others. Whatever we can do to help them during this difficult period, I would strongly recommend we, as a Party and for the sake of desperately needed UNITY, do,"" Trump posted on social media, adding, ""We have a lot of money left over in that our biggest asset in the campaign was “Earned Media,” and that doesn’t cost very much.""Trump also has signaled he's going to govern differently from 2016 -- with new personnel in his cabinet and senior ranks -- when he was unprepared and surprised to find himself in the White House. Under pressure from MAGA rank and file to dispense with anyone remotely critical of him during his time out of office, he announced on Saturday that he will ""not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley , or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to join the Trump Administration, which is currently in formation,"" while thanking them for their past service. Haley, who fought him for the Republican nomination and had been critical of him before finally endorsing him, wished him success.There is also wide-spread apprehension that he will purge the Pentagon of top commanders who do not hew to his line, given his pledge to during the campaign to fire so-called ""woke"" generals. Some generals are already said to be informally discussing how to respond if Trump should order them into action against civilians or to round up immigrants, as he has sometimes promised to do. The MAGA supremo sees Washington's military and strategic establishment as perpetual war-mongers and has expressed disdain for America's endless wars, while at the same time talking up the US military in what his supporters see as a ""peace through strength"" policy.The President-elect will be in almost total control of Washington DC when he takes oath of office on January 20, 2025, with only the final tally from the elections to the House of Representatives due. Republicans lead 212-202, with 218 required for a majority, which they are expected to achieve narrowly. In that event, MAGA Republicans will control the White House, the Senate, the House, and the US Supreme Court for a full-court press to fundamentally remake the United States of America."," MAGA supremo Donald Trump has flipped Arizona, the last state to officially declare results on Saturday to sweep all seven battleground states in the 2024 presidential election.

Yes, the election is over and Kamala Harris lost the election to Donald Trump but Jamal Simmons thinks the Democrats can go crazy and turn the tables on Trump. How? Simmons posted on X that Biden should resign so that Kamala Harris can take over as president before Donald Trump's inauguration. Joe Biden has been amazing but he should fulfill one last promise - to be transitional. Biden should resign and make Kamala Harris the first woman president. It’d turn tables on Trump, keep Kamala from presiding over Jan 6 make it easier for next woman to run,"" Simmons wrote.""Dems have better policies but we must realize the old rules no longer apply.

On a panel at CNN's State of the Union, he said Biden has been a phenomena president and lived up to so many of the promises he's made but there's one promise left to be fulfilled and that's being a transitional figure.His statement came in the response to what the most important thing everyone is looking for during te last two months of the Biden-Harris administration. Simmons said the move could also relieve the next woman who runs from the ""historical weight of being the first"" female president and will also disrupt some of President-elect Donald Trump's merchandise as then Trump would not be the 47th president but 48th.“Well the Supreme Court might happen, I don’t know if it will.

Democrat Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked her Instagram followers why they voted for her in New York's 14th congressional district but for Donald Trump in the presidential election. “Let’s do this right now. If you voted for Donald Trump and me, or if you voted for Donald Trump and voted Democratic down-ballot, I would really love to hear from you,” Ocasio-Cortez said during a Q&A on her Instagram story. Then she posted some of the responses with the caption: ""I'm listening"".""I know ppl that did this and it was bc of Gaza,"" one responded. ""I support you and did this. Felt like I didn't have a choice after Biden's administration,"" another response read. Other responses included: ""Voted for trump and you, not genocide Harris. Dems need bernie!!""; ""He speaks of war as something that is bad. Democrats became the party that supports war""; ""It's real simple...trump and you care for the working class""; ""I feel like Trump and you are both real""; ""Voted Trump, but I like you & Bernie. I don't trust either party establishment politicians""; ""I feel that you both are outsiders compared to the rest of DC, and less 'establishment'"".AOC was easily re-elected Tuesday but her district swung to Trump in the presidential polls by one of the highest margins. In 2020, 77 per cent voted for Joe Biden and 22 per cent for Trump but in 2024, just 65 per cent voted for Harris and 33 per cent voted for Trump, according to city voting records.A close ally of Bernie Sanders, AOC in 2018 said she had won the election while Trump was in office by sticking to ""a laser-focused message of economic, social and racial dignity for working-class Americans"".AOC said social media apps like Instagram and X are influenced by the billionaires who own them. “If you’re only tuning in to those mediums, you will think that most people fall along this spectrum,” she said. “And a lot of people don’t, and that’s why it’s important to be at the doors, and that’s why it’s important to be on the phones, and that’s why it’s never just like a little junior thing that you grow out of, but that we always need to be listening, because you will learn a lot.”","Democrat Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked her Instagram followers why they voted for her in New York's 14th congressional district but for Donald Trump in the presidential election.

'Army chief for life': How the 'establishment' is tightening its grip on elected government in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/army-chief-for-life-how-the-establishment-is-tightening-its-grip-on-elected-government-in-pakistan/articleshow/115173618.cms,"Implication of the amendment

The 'establishment'



Not the first time

More changes



The recent amendment to the Pakistan Army Act, which extends the tenure of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) from three to five years, has sparked significant debate and concern regarding the implications for civil-military relations in Pakistan .This legislative change, hastily approved by the ruling coalition led by PM Shehbaz Sharif's PML-N, not only lengthens the term of the army chief but also removes the retirement age limit for four-star generals, effectively allowing military leaders to remain in power indefinitely.The amendment allows the current COAS, General Asim Munir , who was appointed in November 2022 and was set to retire in 2025, to potentially serve until 2027 or longer if further extensions are granted. This change is seen as a continuation of a trend where military leaders have managed to extend their tenures beyond traditional limits.The amendment was moved by defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif and received majority support despite strong opposition protests from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by former PM Imran Khan.The PTI lawmakers criticised the expedited process of passing such crucial legislation without adequate debate, arguing that it undermines democratic principles in a country already grappling with political instabilityThe removal of the retirement age limit for the army chief raises critical concerns about the balance of power between civilian governance and military authority in Pakistan.Critics argue that this move consolidates military power at a time when civilian institutions are already perceived as weak. The ability for an army chief to remain in power indefinitely could lead to a scenario where military influence over political affairs becomes even more pronounced, effectively sidelining elected representatives.Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, noted that such legislative actions transform the legislative into a ""rubber stamp"", thereby diminishing democratic governance.The Pakistan army has been a dominant force in the country's political landscape since its inception in 1947, often overshadowing elected governments.The military's involvement in politics began almost immediately, with its first significant intervention occurring in 1958 when General Muhammad Ayub Khan led a coup against the civilian government, citing corruption and inefficiency.Since that initial coup, the army has directly ruled the country for about 36 years, while also exerting considerable influence during periods of civilian rule.Major coups occurred under Ayub Khan (1958), Yahya Khan (1969), and Zia-ul-Haq (1977), each time justifying military rule as necessary for national stability.The military's rationale often centered around restoring order amid political chaos, which has led to a cycle of governance where elected officials frequently find themselves subordinate to military interests.The intertwining of military and political affairs has given rise to what analysts describe as the ""establishment"" or ""deep state"", where the military operates behind the scenes to influence policy decisions even when not in direct control.This dynamic has allowed the army to maintain significant control over key areas such as foreign policy, security, and economic management. For instance, during recent political upheavals, including the ousting of former Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022, the military played a crucial role in shaping political outcomes.Elected governments have often been compelled to align their policies with military interests.Political leaders are acutely aware that their tenure could be jeopardized by military intervention if they stray too far from the army's preferences. This has led to a pattern where civilian governments consult with military leaders on critical issues, particularly those involving national security and foreign relations. The recent amendments to extend the tenure of the Chief of Army Staff reflect this ongoing power dynamic, allowing military leadership to exert even greater influence over governance without the constraints of a retirement age.In defense of the amendments, government officials have argued that extending military tenures is essential for maintaining stability and continuity in Pakistan's security leadership amid regional tensions. They contend that allowing military chiefs to serve longer terms will enable them to address national security challenges without disruptions caused by frequent leadership changes.Supporters of the amendment also claim that aligning military leadership tenures with other constitutional offices—many of which have five-year terms—provides a rational framework for governance.The legislative change is not unprecedented in Pakistan's history.Previous army chiefs have also enjoyed extended tenures through similar amendments or political maneuvering.General Qamar Javed Bajwa had his term extended multiple times during his tenure from 2016 to 2022.The pattern of extending military leadership has become almost standard practice, raising questions about accountability and oversight within Pakistan's political system.Observers note that General Munir's potential extended tenure could mirror historical figures like General Zia-ul-Haq, whose prolonged rule led to widespread discontent among both military ranks and civilians due to perceived mismanagement and authoritarian practices.The removal of age limits and potential for indefinite extensions could lead to a scenario where future army chiefs similarly consolidate power.Moreover, there are concerns that these changes may pave the way for further legal amendments aimed at consolidating military power across other branches of government.For instance, recent discussions around increasing the number of Supreme Court judges could be interpreted as an attempt to ensure favorable judicial outcomes for military interests.","The Pakistan army has been a dominant force in the country's political landscape since its inception in 1947.

Trump Picks Hardliners Marco Rubio, Mike Waltz For U.S. Secy Of State & Security Chief Positions

US President-elect Donald Trump has started building his administrative team with appointments of several advisers and political associates to various positions, including the role of White House chief of staff.His initial appointments have focused on crucial policy areas, particularly immigration, which featured prominently in his campaign messaging for 2024.The anticipated administration structure is likely to differ from his previous term. In an October interview, he acknowledged that selecting ""bad, disloyal people"" was his primary error during his first tenure.Susie Wiles, aged 67, served as the principal adviser and effective campaign manager for Trump's 2024 presidential bid.Her political roots are deeply embedded in Florida's political landscape. Initially, she contributed to Ron DeSantis's successful gubernatorial campaign. Later, she played an instrumental role in Trump's victory over DeSantis during the 2024 Republican primary.As Trump's first significant appointment following his president-elect status, Wiles's selection could prove crucial for the incoming administration, given her established rapport with him. Her leadership of Trump's most structured presidential campaign among his three attempts notably earned his confidence.She distinguished herself by successfully steering Trump's direction through a unique approach. Rather than challenging his instincts directly, she gained his respect by demonstrating positive outcomes when he followed her strategic guidance.Mike Waltz, a retired Army National Guard officer, has been selected as national security adviser. The three-term Florida congressman brings experience from multiple Afghanistan tours and previous Pentagon service. He will address various international challenges, including Ukraine's armament needs, Russia-North Korea relations, Middle Eastern conflicts, and Israel's situation with Hamas and Hezbollah.Tom Homan, 62, has been designated as 'border czar'. The former US Immigration and Customs Enforcement leader under Trump's first administration will oversee an extensive deportation programme. Despite promising humane implementation, his support for previous strict border policies has drawn criticism from Democrats.Elise Stefanik, appointed as United Nations ambassador, has consistently supported Trump since his first impeachment. The 40-year-old New York representative, currently third-ranking in House leadership, gained prominence through her questioning of university presidents regarding campus antisemitism.Stephen Miller, aged 39, assumes the role of deputy chief of staff for policy. The former senior adviser and immigration hardliner currently leads America First Legal, challenging various institutions on free speech and national security matters.Lee Zeldin, aged 44, has been nominated to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. The former New York representative, whilst lacking environmental expertise, has pledged to promote American energy independence whilst maintaining environmental standards.",Trump picks hardliners Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz for U.S. Secy Of State & Security Chief positions.

BNP worried interim govt may extend tenure

DHAKA: Bangladesh’s newly appointed interim govt adviser Mahfuj Alam has removed the portrait of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from the Darbar Hall of Banga Bhaban, in what critics said was “complete and utter disrespect” of the country’s first president and the constitution.Banga Bhaban is the residence and main workplace of the President of Bangladesh.Posting a photo of himself at Darbar Hall after taking oath on Sunday, Mahfuj on Monday wrote on Facebook: “It is a shame for us that we couldn’t remove his pictures from Banga Bhaban after the 5th of August. Apologies.”A political activist, who wished to remain unnamed, suggested that the removal of Mujib’s portrait from Darbar Hall might be linked to a desire to alter the constitution and erase the spirit of 1971 Liberation War , “promoting a Pakistani ideology in Bangladesh”.The Bangladesh constitution mandates that the portrait of Mujibur be preserved and displayed at the offices of the president, PM, speaker, and chief justice, as well as at all govt and semi-govt offices.Mujibur is also the father of deposed PM Sheikh Hasina “No individual should change it (the constitution) with the stroke of a pen,” Kamal Hossain , one of the framers of the current constitution said, adding, “reforms should be carried out only after taking people’s opinions into account”.Suspecting that Bangladesh’s interim govt may be thinking of extending its tenure, the BNP has reminded the Muhammad Yunus-led dispensation that its primary duty is to promptly transfer power to elected representatives after conducting a fair election.On Monday, senior BNP politician Hafizuddin Ahmed claimed several individuals with pro-Awami League affiliations had been appointed to the interim govt’s advisory council.Two leading coordinators of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement have also criticised the new govt additions.The interim govt was expanded Sunday with the addition of three new advisers. Two of them — businessman Sk Bashir Uddin and popular filmmaker Mostofa Sarwar Farooki — are perceived to be linked to the deposed Sheikh Hasina govt.",Bangladesh’s newly appointed interim govt adviser Mahfuj Alam has removed the portrait of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from the Darbar Hall of Banga Bhaban.

LONDON: An opponent of vaccines who wrote social media posts urging violence against scientists, politicians and public health officials during the Covid-19 pandemic was sentenced Monday to five years in prison after being convicted of encouraging terrorism .A British judge said 55-year-old Patrick Ruane had a “compulsive and obsessive” opposition to vaccines and spewed vitriol on the Telegram messaging app . One message described “whacking” England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, over the head.In a series of messages in 2021, Ruane posted that he was “all for hunting them down and … executing” those who made and delivered Covid-19 vaccines. He encouraged others to “find where they live, put a kill squad together and shoot” them in their beds.In a discussion about Whitty, the vaccine opponent wrote that hitting someone on the back of the skull with a bat or a metal mace “would turn said target into a vegetable for the rest of its life.” He also advocated blowing up vaccine laboratories and 5G phone towers.“This wasn’t idle chit-chat online – he was encouraging people to seriously injure or kill others, suggesting who to target,” said acting commander of the Met Police counterterrorism command.

American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone

US President-elect Donald Trump according to NYT has chosen Republican Senator Marco Rubio as his pick for Secretary of State , positioning Rubio to become the first Latino to serve in America's top diplomatic role.Born in Miami, Florida, on May 28, 1971, Rubio has earned a reputation as a conservative leader, particularly on foreign policy issues. He is known for his hawkish stance on countries like China, Iran, and Cuba. Rubio’s selection is seen as an effort by Trump to diversify his administration's leadership, potentially strengthening his appeal among Latino voters , a demographic that has traditionally leaned Democratic but shifted in Trump's favour during the recent election.While Rubio has been a vocal advocate for a strong US presence on the world stage, he has, in recent years, adjusted some of his positions to align with Trump’s approach of restraint.Rubio’s parents emigrated from Cuba in 1956, settling first in Miami and later in Las Vegas, where his father worked as a bartender and his mother as a hotel housekeeper. Although raised Catholic, Rubio was briefly baptized as a Mormon before returning to his Catholic roots. The family returned to Florida in 1985, where Rubio graduated from the University of Florida in 1993 before earning a law degree from the University of Miami.Rubio’s political career began early. He worked for Republican Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen before serving on the West Miami City Commission. In 1999, he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives, where he served until 2008, including stints as majority leader and speaker.In 2009, Rubio launched his campaign for the US Senate seat left vacant by Mel Martinez’s resignation. Initially trailing Florida Governor Charlie Crist, Rubio’s fortunes changed when Crist broke from the Republican Party and declared himself an independent. Rubio won the 2010 election by a significant margin in a three-way race.Once in the Senate, Rubio aligned himself with the conservative wing of the Republican Party. He opposed key Democratic initiatives such as gun control, the Affordable Care Act, and climate-change legislation. Despite this, he broke with many in his party when he co-authored a 2013 immigration reform bill that sought to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The bill ultimately failed to pass.Rubio also became known for his foreign policy views, particularly his opposition to the Obama administration's attempts to normalize relations with Cuba. His foreign policy stance has often reflected an interventionist approach, particularly regarding China and the Middle East.Rubio’s 2016 presidential campaign was initially seen as a strong challenge to Donald Trump. He positioned himself as a candidate who could unite the Republican Party establishment but struggled against Trump’s dominance in the race. After a brutal series of defeats, Rubio suspended his campaign after losing the Florida primary.Following his return to the Senate, Rubio began to embrace more populist conservative views, aligning more closely with Trump’s America First agenda. He became a vocal supporter of Trump and developed a strong working relationship with him. Although Rubio initially backed efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, he ultimately voted to certify Joe Biden’s victory after the January 6 Capitol attack.Rubio’s foreign policy views align with Trump on many fronts, though there are some key differences. Both have been critical of Nato, with Rubio co-sponsoring legislation that would make it more difficult for a president to withdraw from the alliance without Senate approval. Rubio is also a staunch critic of China, pushing for greater scrutiny of Chinese investments in US technology and advocating for a hardline approach on issues like Huawei’s influence.One of Rubio’s most personal stances is his opposition to normalizing relations with Cuba, a policy he shares with Trump. He is also a vocal critic of the Maduro regime in Venezuela, reflecting his deep personal connection to the island through his Cuban-American heritage.Rubio is married to Jeanette Dousdebes, whom he met as a teenager, and they have four children. He has authored two books:(2012), a memoir about his upbringing, and(2015), which outlines his policy views.","Donald Trump has chosen Republican Senator Marco Rubio as his pick for Secretary of State.

Who is Mike Waltz?

US President-elect Donald Trump has selected Republican Representative Mike Waltz as his national security adviser, as per various media reports. Waltz, a former Army Green Beret, who is also the head of India caucus , has established himself as a prominent critic of China.The position of national security adviser does not need Senate approval. In this role, Waltz will brief Trump on crucial national security matters and facilitate inter-agency coordination.Born in Boynton Beach, Florida, Waltz was raised by a single mother and is the son and grandson of Navy Chiefs. He is a three-term Republican representative from Florida's east-central region, holds the distinction of being the first Green Beret (US special forces) elected to the US House of Representatives.Recently re-elected, Waltz has served as chairman of the House armed services subcommittee on readiness and has been a member of both the House foreign affairs committee and the permanent select committee on intelligence, according to The Associated Press.Waltz has openly supported Trump's foreign policy positions whilst criticising the Biden administration's 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal. He once said, ""Disruptors are often not nice. Frankly our national security establishment and certainly a lot of people that are dug into bad old habits in the Pentagon need that disruption,"" adding, ""Donald Trump is that disruptor.""As co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans, Waltz was instrumental in arranging Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 2023 address at Capitol Hill during his US visit. The Senate’s India Caucus, established in 2004 by then-Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator John Cornyn, was the first country-focused caucus established in the Senate. It promotes a relationship between India and the United States, ""based on mutual trust and respect"".A strong advocate for robust defense policies, especially in terms of US-India relations and countering China's influence, Waltz is a seasoned expert on foreign policy. He has championed closer ties with India, focusing on defense and security collaboration.Waltz has consistently taken a strong stance on China, previously calling for a US boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, citing China’s role in the Covid-19 outbreak and its alleged mistreatment of Uighur Muslims.Waltz is also a member of the Republicans' China Task Force, where he has voiced concerns about the US military's readiness for a potential conflict in the Indo-Pacific region. In his book, ""Hard Truths: Think and Lead Like a Green Beret"", published earlier this year, Waltz outlined a five-part approach to avoiding war with China. His strategy includes accelerating arms deliveries to Taiwan, strengthening commitments to Pacific allies, and modernizing US aircraft and naval fleets.Regarding Ukraine, Waltz's stance has evolved over time. After Russia's 2022 invasion, he urged the Biden administration to increase weapon support to Kyiv to counter Russian forces. However, during a recent event, he suggested the need for a reassessment of US objectives in Ukraine, questioning whether the nation's current investments align with America's strategic interests in the Pacific.""Is it in America's interest, are we going to put in the time, the treasure, the resources that we need in the Pacific right now badly?"" he asked.Waltz has commended Trump for encouraging Nato allies to boost defense spending, though he diverges from the president-elect's stance on potentially leaving the alliance. ""Look, we can be allies and friends and have tough conversations,"" Waltz said last month.Waltz's potential new role could signal a shift toward a more assertive US approach to China and a strengthened partnership with India—an alliance Waltz believes is crucial for stability and mutual benefits in defense and economics.Known for his hardline stance on China, Waltz has highlighted the importance of alliances with democracies like India to reinforce regional stability. His experience as a military veteran is expected to translate into joint US-India initiatives on defense, intelligence, and counter-terrorism efforts, particularly in Asia.A graduate of the Virginia Military Institute, Waltz served four years in active-duty Army before joining the Florida Guard. He completed multiple combat in Afghanistan, the Middle East, and Africa, earning four Bronze Stars for his service.","US President-elect Donald Trump has selected Republican Representative Mike Waltz as his national security adviser.

The traditional meeting, which usually marks the beginning of a peaceful transition between the outgoing and incoming first families, will take place without Melania, who reportedly has a scheduling conflict related to the promotion of her newly released memoir.A source close to the situation told CNN that while the decision had not been officially confirmed, Melania Trump would not be participating in the meeting with Jill Biden, scheduled for Wednesday at 11am. Meanwhile, a representative from Jill Biden’s office stated that the Bidens had extended their congratulations to the Trumps, along with an invitation for the traditional White House visit. However, it appears Melania has declined the offer.This marks a major shift from the usual protocol, which has seen outgoing and incoming first ladies meeting to exchange advice and set a tone of collaboration ahead of the new administration. In 2020, a similar meeting between Jill Biden and Melania Trump did not take place, as Donald Trump refused to meet with Joe Biden after his election defeat, citing unfounded claims of election fraud.This year’s White House meeting is particularly noteworthy as it will be the first time an outgoing president has met with an incoming one he competed against in a campaign since the 1992 transition, when President George HW Bush sat down with President-elect Bill Clinton.Following the 2016 election, Trump and then-President Barack Obama held a 90-minute discussion in the Oval Office, where Obama expressed his commitment to helping Trump succeed for the sake of the country.Despite some initial awkwardness, the meeting was described as cordial, with Trump calling Obama ""a good man"" and expressing respect for him. However, this brief moment of cooperation quickly gave way to Trump’s contentious presidency, marked by baseless claims of wiretapping and accusations against Obama.","Incoming First Lady Melania Trump will not attend the customary White House meeting with First Lady Jill Biden, CNN reported.

DUBAI: Israel has begun a construction project along the so-called Alpha Line that separates the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights from Syria, apparently laying asphalt for a road right along the frontier, satellite photos analysed by the AP show. Israeli troops have entered the demilitarised zone during the work, the United Nations confirmed to the AP, a violation of the ceasefire rules governing the area.The work, which earlier satellite photos show began in earnest in late Sept, follows the completion by the Israeli military of new roadways and what appears to be a buffer zone along the Gaza Strip’s frontier with Israel.The Israel military also has begun demolishing villages in Lebanon, where UN peacekeepers have come under fire. So far, there has been no major violence along the Alpha Line, which delineates the demilitarised zone between Syria and Israeli-occupied territory that UN peacekeepers have patrolled since 1974.Syria, which has been at war with Israel since its founding in 1948 and relies on Iran for support, has remained silent regarding the construction.But the Golan Heights remain a flashpoint for the two countries — making any changes along the border potentially that much more sensitive. The Israeli military did not respond to requests for comm ent and Syrian officials in Damascus declined to comment.High-resolution images taken on Nov 5 by Planet Labs PBC for the AP show over 7.5km of construction along the Alpha Line, starting some 3km southeast of the Israeli-held Druze town of Majdal Shams, where a July rocket strike killed 12 children playing soccer. The images appear to show a trench between two embankments, parts of which appear to have been laid with fresh asphalt. There also appears to be fencing running along it as well toward the Syrian side.The construction follows a southeast route before heading due south along the Alpha Line, and then again cutting southeast. The images show excavators and other earth-moving equipment actively digging along the route, with more asphalt piled there.
