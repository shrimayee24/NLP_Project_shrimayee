SC raps ED for 'rigid approach' to deny accused access to documents,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-raps-ed-for-rigid-approach-to-deny-accused-access-to-documents/articleshow/113073106.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Wednesday reserved its verdict on whether an accused is entitled to get at the pre-trial stage documents which are in possession of Enforcement Directorate but not relied upon by the agency in money laundering cases and questioned the agency on the justification for taking a ""rigid approach"" by denying such documents to the accused.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka, Ahsanuddin Amanullah and Augustine George Masih asked the agency whether withholding clinching documents in favour of an accused would not violate the accused's rights granted under the Constitution .""What troubles us is that when there can be a clinching document, which is very much there, very much exists, and only because of procedural angles, the accused does not get that document. Does it not affect Article 21 ? Now, the law has progressed, the interpretation of the Constitution has progressed. Can we say now that there is a document in existence, but relying upon some technicalities, you will not get it?"" the bench asked additional solicitor general S V Raju.Raju said an accused has the right to get unrelied upon documents only after framing of charges, and till the trial begins. He said handing over all documents to accused would hamper probe in the case.The court, however, asked him how an accused could defend his case at the time of seeking bail if he did not have those documents which were in his favour.","Supreme Court reserved its verdict on whether an accused is entitled to get at the pre-trial stage documents.

Kolkata Doctor Rape Murder: Union health ministry orders states to submit hospital security reports after Kolkata horror,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/union-health-ministry-orders-states-to-submit-hospital-security-reports-after-kolkata-horror/articleshow/113072137.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Union Health Ministry has issued a directive to states , asking them to submit reports detailing the actions taken to improve security measures in medical institutions .This comes after a virtual conference held on August 28, where Union Health Secretary Apurva Chandra discussed key security concerns with chief secretaries and directors general of police (DGPs) from all states and Union territories.The meeting focused on identifying hospitals with high footfall as high-risk establishments and emphasised the importance of conducting security audits in consultation with local health and police authorities. Special attention was given to areas prone to security breaches, such as emergency rooms, intensive care units (ICUs), and labour rooms.States were also encouraged to ensure the installation and proper functioning of CCTV cameras, particularly in high-risk areas, with regular monitoring from a central control room.Additionally, they discussed quickly sharing incident video footage with local police to ensure fast responses.The ministry also recommended employing ex-servicemen as security personnel in identified high-risk areas and focused on the need for internal security committees in hospitals, involving resident doctors and students.Clear standard operating procedures (SOPs) for incident response and thorough background checks for all outsourced and contractual workers were highlighted as essential steps.It also emphasised on proper training and establishment of bereavement protocols for all doctors and healthcare workers to handle intense and emotional grief situations and deployment of patient facilitators or MTS for all patient-related activities inside the hospitals, which requires ferrying or shifting patients from diagnostics to therapeutics.""Most of the states/UTs have informed in the meeting that various actions are already initiated as per the suggestions provided in the letter dated 23.08.2024 by the undersigned. It is also heartening to note that some of the states have initiated additional measures over and above those suggested by the MoHFW.

US presidential elections: Kamala insists she is underdog even though polls show her leading; more Republicans abandon Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-elections-kamala-insists-she-is-underdog-even-though-polls-show-her-leading-more-republicans-abandon-trump/articleshow/113068202.cms,"WASHINGTON: Conservative Republicans continue to publicly abandon MAGA supremo Donald Trump amid signs his campaign is starting to tank in the face of growing support for Kamala Harris from women and gen x voters.Former vice-president Mike Pence, whose life was threatened by a MAGA mob during the January 6 insurrection, publicly said on Tuesday that he ""cannot in good conscience"" endorse his then President in the 2024 race.Separately, late Republican Senator John McCain's son Jimmy McCain, a first lieutenant in the National Guard, announced he has joined the Democrat party and pledged to support Kamala Harris.The twin blows to the erratic Trump campaign that is struggling for energy and momentum came amid two other signs that things are not going well for the former President.A campaign official whose leaked internal memo said Trump stood no chance in New Hampshire and he would be better served by diverting resources to another battleground state was fired. And emboldened by raising more than $ 500million in the last six weeks and by small but steady leads in presidential polls , the Harris campaign diverted $ 25 million in campaign finance for down ballot races to the Congress and state legislatures, as Democrats eyed far more than just the White House.But it was Pence sticking it to his former boss that riled the MAGA mob which had threatened to hang him from the steps of the Capitol on January 6 for declining to support Trump's claim that he had won the 2020 election. Almost four years after falling foul of Trump for his defiance in adhering to the Constitution, the mild-mannered Pence told Fox News that Trump ""is pursuing and articulating an agenda that is at odds with the conservative agenda that we governed on during our four years"" so he ""cannot in good conscience"" endorse him.Pence did not reveal who he’ll vote for in the 2024 general election, saying that he’ll keep “my vote to myself,” but the late Republican stalwart John McCain's son Jimmy McCain was not so coy, bluntly telling CNN that he has changed his voter registration to Democrat and plans to support Kamala Harris.McCain Jr expressed outrage over a recent altercation involving Trump campaign staff at Arlington National Cemetery, calling it “violation” while recalling the MAGA supremo's repeated slighting of his father, a Vietnam war hero, saying he “could never forgive” Trump for the insults. The McCain family is widely respected in Arizona, a battleground state that Trump lost by just 10,000 votes (0.3 per cent) in 2020, with some polls putting him marginally ahead in 2024.Overall, the Presidential elections are now boiling down to seven battleground states, with both sides wheeling out polls showing their candidate ahead, although all polls are within or close to the margin of error, and neither candidate is ahead by 5 per cent, which is considered a safe margin. in any state.But despite more polls showing Kamala Harris almost level or marginally ahead of Trump, having erased the lead he had when Biden was his opponent, the Democratic nominee remains cautious. She characterized herself in Labor Day rallies as the ""underdog"" and told her supporters that a lot of hard work remains to be done to win the White House.Some of the caution is because of the belief among analysts that polls consistently underestimate support for Trump, partly because some moderate supporters are too embarrassed to tell pollsters they are voting for him, and party because his MAGA base is hostile to mainstream media surveys.While the demographics appear to favor Harris, with women, gen x voters, and blacks/minorities breaking for her in a big way, Trump pulls ahead when it comes to issue-based voting featuring the economy and immigration.In recent weeks through, Trump has lost even more ground among women, particularly white women, after a series of missteps on the issue of abortions rights, a top priority for many women. Trump had a 13-point advantage among white women before the Democratic convention and that has now been whittled down to a 2-point edge. Harris is leading Trump 54 percent to 41 percent among women, according to an ABC News/Ipsos poll released Sunday.","Former vice-president Mike Pence publicly said on Tuesday that he ""cannot in good conscience"" endorse his then President in the 2024 race.

But asked ""why should I vote for Kamala Harris?"" Alexa gave a more enthusiastic and positive response (in the same neutral tone though).""While there are many reasons to vote for Kamala Harris, the most significant may be that she is a female of color with a comprehensive plan to address racial injustice and inequality throughout the country,"" the VA said in one response. ""Additionally, her experience as a prosecutor and her record of accomplishment in the areas of criminal justice and immigration reform make her a compelling candidate,"" it added.To the same question asked a second time, Alexa said, ""Harris, a former prosecutor and attorney general, emphasizes her law and order credentials and promises a tough on crime approach to battling the violent crime wave that has swept the nation in recent years.""Amazon said Alexa does not have any political opinion and the error has since been rectified. Questions relating to both candidates posed on Wednesday elicited the same response: ""I cannot provide content that promotes a specific political party or specific candidate.""But agitated Trump fans took it out on Alexa, and in scenes reminiscent of crazed cricket fans in the subcontinent smashing tv sets when their team loses, a MAGA supporter posted a video showing her battering an Alexa device with a hammer.Trump himself has long railed against big tech, particularly Google and Amazon, accusing them of working against him, although some of his gripes have since been mitigated by his new-found support from Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter). Some officials have said Russian bots played a key role in swaying the outcome of the 2016 and 2020 elections, and already there are suspicion of image management, disinformation, and manipulation in the current cycle.","Amazon's virtual assistant appeared to support Kamala Harris over Donald Trump in the 2024 elections.

In Michigan, independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who endorsed Trump last month, is drawing 4% support despite his campaign suspension and difficulties removing his name from the ballot.Trump maintains a lead in Arizona, where he garners 49% of likely voter support compared to Harris’ 44%.

Russian lawmakers denounce US sanctions against Russian state media network,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russian-lawmakers-denounce-us-sanctions-against-russian-state-media-network/articleshow/113077789.cms,"MOSCOW: Russian lawmakers denounced as an infringement of freedom of speech US punitive measures against state media group RT as part of what officials in Washington described as a campaign to influence the November presidential election.The US justice department on Wednesday filed money-laundering charges against two employees of Russian state media network RT for what was described as a scheme to hire a US company to produce online content to influence the election.Previous US intelligence assessments have found that Moscow tried to meddle in the 2016 and 2020 elections. Russian officials have suggested that the United States has also meddled in its domestic affairs.The Kremlin and the Russian Foreign Ministry have repeatedly said that Moscow has not meddled in the US election, but is watching it closely.Konstantin Kosachev, Deputy Chairman of Russia's upper house of parliament, told RIA news agency that the US moves were aimed at preventing alternative views from being made known.""Russian media in this sense have become increasingly popular and in demand,"" Kosachev told RIA.""That is the reason behind the rabid reaction of the US authorities, which is totally at odds with the principles of freedom of speech and defending the rights of journalists.""Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the State Duma lower house's foreign affairs committee, branded the sanctions ""a witch-hunt, pressure on freedom of speech and vulgar censorship"".""The agents of the 'empire of lies' are waging war on everyone who tells the truth about the policy of contemporary neo-colonialists,"" said Slutsky.There was no immediate Kremlin reaction to the sanctions.The Kremlin in June dismissed as absurd US intelligence assertions that Russia sought to meddle in the election and has said that US spies were intent on casting Russia as an enemy.President Vladimir Putin had suggested in the past that, for Russia, Joe Biden would have been preferable to Donald Trump, though he spoke with irony about Biden.Ahead of the announcement of the sanctions, Russian lawmaker Maria Butina said any suggestion of meddling in the election was nonsense. Moscow, she said, felt that the only winner of the election would be the US military-industrial complex.""The US claims were and are pure rubbish and a witch hunt,"" Butina, who spent 15 months in US prison for acting as an unregistered Russian agent and is now a lawmaker for the ruling United Russia party, told Reuters.""Russia thinks it does not matter who wins the US elections – the only winner is the US private military-industrial complex. That is what matters – and nothing else,"" Butina said.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview published on Sunday that Russia saw US Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris as a more predictable opponent than Trump, but said there was no prospect of an improvement in relations with Washington anyway.","Russian lawmakers denounce as an infringement of freedom of speech US punitive measures against state media group RT.

Former President Trump, ever the social media enthusiast, reposted the photo on Truth Social, exclaiming, “It is a Great Honor to have your Endorsement. I look forward to meeting you soon!”The photo first appeared on X, shared by Charles Herbster, a former Nebraska gubernatorial candidate who had Trump’s endorsement in 2022.Herbster’s spokesperson, Rod Edwards, confirmed that the people in the photo are indeed related to Tim Walz , according to AP. “The family in the picture are the descendants of Francis Walz, who was the brother of Tim Walz’s grandfather,” Edwards said.In a twist of family drama , the Nebraska Walz clan confirmed their relation to Tim Walz. “Shortly after Governor Tim Walz was named the Democrat Party Vice Presidential nominee, our family had a get-together. We had t-shirts made to show support for President Trump and D Vance and took a group picture. That photo was shared with friends, and when we were asked for permission to post the picture, we agreed,” the written statement said as reported by AP. “The picture is real. The shirts are real. We are the Nebraska Walzs and we are related to Gov. Tim Walz, our grandfathers were brothers.”Sandy Dietrich, Walz’s sister from Alliance, Nebraska, seemed bemused by the attention. “I suspected it might be people from that branch of the family. We weren’t close with them. We didn’t know them,” she said. Dietrich and Walz’s father, James Walz, died of lung cancer in 1984 when the future congressman and Minnesota governor was just a teenager. His father had been the school superintendent in Valentine, Nebraska.Dietrich, a self-described “Democrat for Tim,” kept her focus on her own political choices, saying, “I know who I’m voting for. That’s all I can control.”Adding more spice to the story, Tim Walz’s older brother, Jeff Walz , has publicly aired his grievances. Jeff, now living in Freeport, Florida, has been vocal about his disapproval of his younger brother’s political ideology. The New York Post reported on Jeff’s Facebook comments, where he expressed, “The stories I could tell. Not the type of character you want making decisions about your future.” Jeff even considered endorsing Trump himself!Jeff Walz later clarified to NewsNation that his comments were more about childhood memories than political bitterness. Jeff said he and the 60-year-old governor have not spoken since the funeral of their younger brother, Craig Walz, in 2016, aside from a brief phone call last month through their mother. “Nobody wanted to sit with him, because he had car sickness and would always throw up on us, that sort of thing,” Jeff said, adding, “There’s really nothing else hidden behind there. People are assuming something else. There’s other stories like that, but I think that probably gives you the gist of it.”As Tim Walz’s campaign for vice president continues, the viral photo and family squabbles add an extra layer of intrigue to the political landscape","Former President Trump endorsed Nebraska Gov.

A legacy of conservatism, now in question

Who is Liz Cheney?

From Trump ally to fierce critic

Endorsing Harris: A calculated decision

Former Rep. Liz Cheney , once a powerful figure within the Republican Party , made headlines with her unexpected endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris for the upcoming presidential election in US. Cheney, who served as the congresswoman from Wyoming from 2017 to 2023, announced her decision at a Duke University event, citing deep concerns over former President Donald Trump and the future of American democracy.Known for her staunch opposition to former President Donald Trump, Cheney said she would be casting her vote for Harris in November, a move she described as essential to safeguarding the Constitution.""I don't believe we have the luxury of writing in candidates' names, particularly in swing states,"" Cheney told the audience. ""As a conservative and someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this and because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump but I will be voting for Kamala Harris.""This marks the first time Cheney has publicly endorsed a candidate in the 2024 race. Despite persistent outreach from the Harris campaign, which has been actively seeking support from Republicans, Cheney had remained silent until now, reported NYT. Her decision to endorse Harris just before the start of early voting was a calculated one, according to sources close to her.Liz Cheney’s roots in the Republican Party run deep. Born in 1966 in Madison, Wisconsin, she is the daughter of Lynne and Dick Cheney, the latter of whom served as Vice President under George W. Bush. Growing up amidst Washington’s political elite, Liz Cheney followed in her father’s footsteps, forging a career in law, government, and eventually politics. Her time in Congress saw her rise to the third-highest position in the House Republican leadership as the chair of the House Republican Conference.Cheney’s political journey took a sharp turn following the 2020 presidential election. Although she had previously aligned with many of Trump’s policies, the aftermath of the election and the January 6th Capitol attack marked a breaking point. Cheney became one of Trump’s most vocal critics, condemning his false claims of a stolen election and voting to impeach him. This stance, while lauded by some, alienated her from the majority of the Republican base and led to her being ousted from her leadership position and eventually losing her seat in the 2022 GOP primary.Despite the backlash, Cheney remained steadfast in her commitment to upholding the Constitution. Her endorsement of Kamala Harris marks a significant departure from traditional Republican politics, driven by what she sees as an existential threat posed by Trump’s continued influence.Cheney’s endorsement is particularly noteworthy given her deep Republican roots and the fact that this is her first public support for a candidate in the 2024 race. Her decision to endorse Harris, just before early voting begins, was a calculated move to ensure her voice would be heard, independent of the noise surrounding the Democratic National Convention.","Former Rep.

The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) has called on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals to remove Judge Aileen Cannon from overseeing the prominent case against former President Donald Trump concerning classified documents . CREW argues that Cannon has taken steps to ""undermine and derail"" the prosecution of the case.CREW President Noah Bookbinder stated that Judge Cannon has consistently shown ""apparant bias"" in favor of Donald Trump and dismissed the case on unprecedented grounds.CREW President Noah Bookbinder said: “She has at every stage made this case more difficult than the law mandated, and she then dismissed it on largely unprecedented grounds, delivering a significant win to Trump.""CREW’s brief highlights several controversial decisions made by Cannon that have raised concerns about her impartiality. Notably, Cannon recently dismissed the entire documents case, ruling that Special Counsel Jack Smith’s appointment was unlawful. This dismissal contradicted established statutory authority and Supreme Court precedents, prompting Smith to appeal the decision.The watchdog also criticizes Cannon for considering arguments that could undermine the government’s case, including spurious jury instructions that would have weakened the prosecution's position. Additionally, CREW highlights Cannon’s slow progress on the case over the past year, emphasizing her failure to move the proceedings forward in a timely manner.The case revolves around allegations that Trump unlawfully retained classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate and obstructed efforts by the FBI to retrieve them. Cannon’s recent dismissal of the case questioned the legitimacy of Smith’s role as special counsel, which has sparked significant legal and political debate, with the elections less than 2 months away.","Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) has called on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals to remove Judge Aileen Cannon from overseeing the prominent case against former President Donald Trump.

This military operation aimed to reclaim control from the militants who had fortified themselves within the mosque.The operation, marked by intense fighting and heavy casualties, drew significant criticism from Islamic groups, who condemned the military's tactics and the resultant civilian suffering. The aftermath of the operation exacerbated anti-government sentiment and contributed to the rise of extremist militancy in Pakistan, highlighting the deep-seated tensions between religious extremism, state authority, and public sentiment, Dawn reported.","The charges were filed at the Lohi Bher police station under Section 11-X of the Anti-Terrorism Act and various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code.

"August deadliest month in Balochistan in six years, reports say",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/august-deadliest-month-in-balochistan-in-six-years-reports-say/articleshow/113018427.cms,"QUETTA: The Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), a think tank based in Islamabad, reported that August has been the most violent month in Balochistan in the past six years.According to PICSS, there has been a 'dangerous increase' in anti-government violence in Pakistan during August, making it the most turbulent month in this period, with Balochistan recording the highest number of deaths.PICSS released a report on Monday indicating that at least 254 people were killed across Pakistan in August, including 92 civilians, 108 militants, and 54 armed soldiers. Furthermore, 150 people were injured in various incidents, with 88 of them being civilians.The majority of fatalities in Pakistan were attributed to 83 militant attacks , which resulted in the deaths of 175 individuals, including 92 civilians, 47 security personnel, and 36 militants. Additionally, 123 people were injured, with 88 civilians and 35 security personnel among them. August has been noted as the deadliest month since July 2018.Reports from other Baloch human rights organizations highlighted that Quetta, Kech, Awaran, and Khuzdar experienced the highest numbers of enforced disappearances , with these districts reporting 10, eight, seven, and six incidents, respectively.The situation in Balochistan is marked by significant challenges and unrest. The region has faced a surge in violence, with frequent militant attacks and ongoing extrajudicial killings. The security situation remains volatile, contributing to a heightened level of instability and human rights abuses. Despite international and local efforts to address these issues, Balochistan continues to grapple with severe human rights violations and a deteriorating security environment.The human rights situation is dire, characterized by ongoing conflict between separatist groups and the government, which has led to violence and military operations. Enforced disappearances are a serious issue, with many individuals being taken by security forces and held without charge. Freedom of expression is severely restricted, with journalists and activists facing threats and suppression, the report stated.Despite being resource-rich, the province remains economically marginalized, contributing to local grievances. Additionally, the conflict has caused significant internal and cross-border displacement. The lack of effective legal recourse and accountability for human rights abuses further exacerbates the problem, making the situation complex and deeply troubling.","August has been the most violent month in Balochistan in the past six years.

Anti-terror op turns sinister: Pakistani netizens being 'walled off' as army raises spectre of 'digital terrorism',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/anti-terror-op-turns-sinister-pakistani-netizens-being-walled-off-as-army-raises-spectre-of-digital-terrorism/articleshow/112898501.cms,"Munir's repeated attacks on social media

Imran's ouster & rise of digital activism

National internet firewall

NEW DELHI: Pakistan 's ""whole-of-system approach"" to countering militancy is evolving and may be taking a turn to the sinister as its army's new anti-terror operation ' Azm-e-Istehkam ' (Resolve for Stability) is increasingly focusing on what it calls "" digital terrorism "".Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir has over the past few months repeatedly warned that digital platforms are being exploited to disseminate misinformation and incite unrest against state institutions.He described the activities of ""inimical"" forces as a form of ""digital terrorism"" aimed at creating discord between the military and the public by spreading ""lies and fake news"".Launched in June, Azm-e-Istehkam is tackling not only traditional militancy, particularly in light of increasing attacks attributed to groups like the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), but the evolving nature of threats in the digital landscape.The shift has sparked widespread concern with some analysts suggesting that the military is carrying out ""prejudiced online surveillance"" and curbing internet speeds across the country to battle the new ""digital threat"".The characterisation of digital terrorism in Munir's speeches have been notably vague, with rights activists noting that the term lacks a clear legal definition and could be weaponised against individuals who express criticism of the military or government policies online.In recent months, Munir has repeatedly voiced ""concerns"" regarding the impact of social media on national security and public discourse.In May -- just months before launching Azm-e-Istehkam -- Munir highlighted the issue of ""negative propaganda"" on social media, asserting that it poses threats to the integrity and security of Pakistan. He emphasised the military's readiness to counter any conspiracies and condemned the spread of disinformation, urging adherence to constitutional limits on freedom of expression, particularly as outlined in Article 19 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which restricts incitement to violence and undermining national security.In August, Munir reiterated these concerns, stating that social media is being exploited to propagate ""anarchy"" and warned against campaigns targeting the military. His remarks came in the context of rising tensions and comparisons being drawn to political instability in neighboring countries.On August 14, he again criticised the misuse of social media for spreading chaos and false information, attributing ""digital terrorism"" to foreign elements. He stressed the state's responsibility to protect citizens from the adverse effects of social media-driven hysteria and urged the public to remain vigilant against misinformation.He also warned that social media was being exploited to propagate ""anarchy"". His remarks that ""anarchy is spread through social media"" followed a condemnation by the army of social media campaigns to target the Pakistan Armed Forces.""Just as terrorists use weapons to get their demands met, digital terrorists use negative propaganda and fake news on social media platforms, mobiles and computers to create despondency to get their demands met,"" Pakistani military spokesperson Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had said.Chaudhry said the military had become the sole target of digital terrorists, and blamed a ""certain"" political party without naming ousted PM Imran Khan ’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf party, which has a formidable social media presence.Imran Khan has repeatedly accused the military for orchestrating his removal from power in April 2022, and specifically named Munir as being responsible for his subsequent arrest in May 2023, claiming the Army chief harboured a ""personal grudge"" against him.Khan also alleged that Munir was behind the crackdown on his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), stating: ""It is personal. It's got nothing to do with national interest"". He also accused Munir of ""dismantling the future of this country [Pakistan] to protect himself"".Khan's arrest led to riots in May where protesters for the first time in the nation's history vented their anger on the military attacking several army installations.Digital activism in Pakistan spiked following Imran's ouster, whose party has relied heavily on social media to coordinate its activities. After TV channels were banned from covering PTI events, Khan gave several speeches online challenging the military's role in politics.These online events were often marred by internet blackouts or slowdown. Though authorities have said the drop in internet speed was due to technical issues, activists have claimed that the army is strategically using a national firewall and manipulating the country's internet infrastructure to curb any dissenting voices on the web.Pakistan has experienced a notable slowdown in internet speeds over the past few months, with reports indicating that up to 40% slower speeds have affected nearly half of the country's 241 million internet users.Users have reported difficulties in sending and receiving messages on platforms like WhatsApp and accessing social media sites, which are crucial for communication and information dissemination, especially among the youth and political activists.Information Technology minister Shiza Fatima Khawaja has confirmed that it was upgrading its ""web management system"" to cope with cybersecurity threats but did not link the development to slower internet speeds.TOI has reported that the Pakistan government tested its firewall on two occasions, once in July and a second time in mid-August. Pakistan has allocated more than $70 million for a Digital Infrastructure Development Initiative in the latest budget.The timing of these frequent slowdowns also coincides with the launch of operation Azm-e-Istehkam, raising questions about whether the internet disruptions are also linked to efforts to control information amid rising political tensions and protests against the military's actions.Technology experts have suggested that the newly implemented internet firewall could provide the government with enhanced capabilities to censor online content, drawing comparisons to China's stringent internet regulations.Countries like China, Iran, Turkiye, and Russia have employed national firewalls for years to regulate internet content, saying they aim to pinpoint and restrict sources of propaganda content.","Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir has repeatedly warned that digital platforms are being exploited to disseminate misinformation and incite unrest against state institutions.

Attacks in Balochistan bid to derail SCO summit in October: Pakistan govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/attacks-in-balochistan-bid-to-derail-sco-summit-in-october-pakistan-govt/articleshow/112974277.cms,"ISLAMABAD: A surge in daring militant attacks across Pakistan’s volatile provinces of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has raised questions about the country’s internal security situation . Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said the attacks were aimed at derailing the SCO heads of govt meeting in Islamabad on Oct 15-16.Amid heightened political polarisation in Pakistan, both Baloch separatists and Islamic militants, known as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), have intensified their attacks on security personnel and their facilities in the country’s southwest and northwest.The Baloch separatists also target people of Punjabi ethnicity in the province.On Aug 26, more than 70 people were killed in targeted killings and suicide bombings in different districts of Balochistan, while in Kulachi tehsil of Dera Ismail Khan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.In a separate incident, a senior army officer, Lt Col Khalid Ameer, and three of his relatives, were kidnapped by TTP fighters when they were meeting people on their father’s death in Dera Ismail Khan. The army’s media wing, however, said on Sunday they have been released due to the role played by tribal elders.When the separatist militant outfit, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), bombed a railway bridge linking Balochistan to the rest of Pakistan, attacked police and military posts, and targeted buses and trucks on a major highway, Pakistan’s Army chief General Asim Munir was meeting General Li Qiaoming, Commander of the People’s Liberation Army, in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. The bombings and shootings on August 25-26 were the deadliest in years in Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran.Former Balochistan chief minister, Abdul Malik Baloch, said disappointment is pushing people into insurgency. “Many Baloch are losing faith in Islamabad because of what they perceive to be its political intervention in the province. Political activists tell me that democracy here is a fraud. They feel we are wasting their time,” Baloch said.BLA’s coordinated attacks in Balochistan on Aug 25–26 demonstrated their growing strength. It is believed that US military hardware and weaponry have found their way into the hands of Pakistani militant organisations. Military equipment and weapons, worth billions of dollars, were left behind by the US and international forces following their withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. BLA’s acquisition of modern weapons, security experts believe, has enhanced its combat capabilities.Majority of BLA’s sophisticated strikes are thought to have been executed by the group’s suicide squad, known as Majeed Brigade.Islamabad blames Kabul for patronising Baloch separatists and the TTP. Qari Fasihuddin Fitrat, the military chief of Afghan Taliban , denied the accusation saying the militants plan and execute attacks from within Pakistan.","Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said the attacks were aimed at derailing the SCO heads of govt meeting in Islamabad on Oct 15-16.

As Pakistan grapples with a surge in terrorist strikes in the past couple of years, its restive Balochistan province was rocked this week by a wave of attacks that have left more than 70 dead. The coordinated strikes, perhaps more widespread than any such assault in the past, by the separatist Baloch Liberation Army ( BLA ), have again foregrounded Baloch insurgency fuelled by decades of neglect and exploitation of impoverished Balochistan's natural resources as the soft underbelly of Pakistan.The attacks, which saw BLA targeting police stations and taking control of major highways, coincided with the death anniversary of Baloch leader Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, who was killed 18 years ago in one of then president Pervez Musharraf's counter-insurgency operations.","Baloch insurgency fuelled by decades of neglect and exploitation of impoverished Balochistan's natural resources.

The country failed to discharge its most fundamental duty: to protect you and your loved ones, the people that we are here to serve, and I am deeply sorry,"" he added.A public inquiry into the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire in London has primarily blamed the disaster on failings by the government, the construction industry , and companies involved in fitting the flammable cladding .The Grenfell Tower blaze, which occurred on June 14, 2017, in a 23-storey social housing block in one of London's wealthiest areas, stands as the deadliest fire in a residential building in Britain since World War Two.In its final 1,700-page report, the inquiry laid most of the responsibility on the companies involved in the building's maintenance and refurbishment and criticised local and national authorities, along with regulatory groups and specific firms, for dishonestly marketing combustible cladding as safe.""The fire at Grenfell Tower was the culmination of decades of failure by central government and other bodies in positions of responsibility in the construction industry,"" stated the inquiry report.Survivors and the families of those who died have long demanded justice and criminal charges for those responsible. British police have indicated that 58 people and 19 firms and organisations are under investigation.An earlier report from the inquiry in 2019 revealed that the fire originated from an electrical fault in a refrigerator in a fourth-floor apartment. The flames spread uncontrollably due to the tower's exterior cladding, which had been added during a 2016 refurbishment.As of July, official data for Britain showed that 3,280 buildings taller than 11 meters still had unsafe cladding, with remediation work yet to commence on more than two-thirds of these structures.","UK PM Keir Starmer apologised on behalf of the British state to Grenfell Tower fire victims.

Juvenile Crime Statistics in the UK (2023-2024)

Youth Justice System Entrants: In the year ending March 2023, there were approximately 8,400 first-time entrants (FTEs) into the youth justice system in England and Wales. This represents a 1% increase compared to the previous year, marking the first rise in a decade. However, this number is still the second lowest in the time series. The increase was mainly observed among children aged 10 to 14, which saw a 7% rise in FTEs, while those aged 15 to 17 experienced a slight decrease of 1%. Arrests and Stop and Search: Arrests of juveniles increased by 9% compared to the previous year, totaling around 59,000 arrests. Stop and search incidents involving children also rose by 13%, reaching approximately 107,800 occurrences. Despite this increase, a significant majority (77%) of these searches resulted in no further action, with only 10% leading to arrests. Black children were disproportionately represented in stop and searches, accounting for 20% of all cases where ethnicity was known, despite making up a smaller percentage of the youth population. Custody and Sentencing: The number of children in custody continued to decline, reaching the lowest levels recorded. There were also reductions in the number of cautions and sentences for crimes involving knives among children, reflecting a broader downward trend in youth custodial sentences. Ethnic Disparities: Black children continue to be overrepresented in the youth justice system. The proportion of Black children involved in stop and searches was notably higher than their representation in the general population of 10 to 17-year-olds, highlighting ongoing concerns about racial disparity within the youth justice framework.

An 80-year-old man of Indian origin was allegedly “kicked in the neck and back” on Sunday evening, September 1, in Franklin Park, Braunstone Town, near Leicester . A group of five schoolchildren aged 12 to 14 have reportedly been taken into custody after they allegedly attacked the elderly, “kind and considerate” dog walker in the park.Leicestershire Police confirmed on Tuesday, September 3, that five children – a boy and a girl aged 14, and two girls and a boy aged 12 – have been arrested on suspicion of murder after Bhim Sen Kohli passed away last night.Kohli was just 30 seconds away from his home when the alleged young attackers assaulted him at 6:30 pm as he was walking his dog at his usual local spot, police stated today.Sources also claim that the group of young people suspected to be responsible for the horrifying tragedy fled the scene after brutally assaulting him. The victim was left screaming in agony at the scene, his daughter said, according to The Sun. Furthermore, she told Leicester Mercury: “He had been taking the dog for a walk. They pushed him, they kicked in the neck, kicked in the spine,” Kohli's daughter added, noting that they have been living in the area for 40 years. She also spoke about rushing to her father, “lying under a tree” after the attack. Emergency Services eventually arrived to assist Bhim Sen Kohli and took him to the hospital, where he later died.One of Kohli's neighbours paid tribute to him, saying that the victim was his friend and their allotments were next to each other.Speaking of his character, the man continued, “He lived to attend his allotment and grew amazing veg and was not a threat to anyone.” He even praised Kohli as a “kind and considerate man.”70-year-old neighbour Deep Singh Kalia had known Kohli for over 30 years and mentioned that they would meet up every day.“We were both originally from Punjab in India. He loved his allotment, loved his dog, and loved his family.”Expanding on the 80-year-old deceased victim's prior engagements, Kalia said, “He used to own a factory that made jumpers and cardigans. He was very fit because he worked on his allotment all the time.”Detective Inspector Emma Matts announced that Kohli's death “has now become a murder investigation .” “We have made a number of arrests as we continue to understand what has happened,” she added while urging people in the area to come forward with any information that could assist the ongoing investigation.Amid the ongoing investigation, scene preservation is still in place at the park where the horrifying incident occurred.Leicestershire Police released a statement on Wednesday: “At 18:30 on Sunday 1st September 2024, an 80-year-old man was assaulted near the Franklin Park entrance, Bramble Way, Braunstone Town, and later died in hospital.”Officials believe that Kohli was wearing a black jumper and grey jogging bottoms on the day of the vicious assault. Five children in the school-going bracket are being interviewed by the police.The latest data on juvenile crime in the UK reveals several key trends:These statistics provide insight into the state of juvenile crime in the UK, indicating both improvements and areas that still require attention, particularly regarding racial disparities and the handling of minor offenses involving children.","There were 8,400 first-time entrants into the youth justice system in England and Wales in the year ending March 2023.
