'I brought it home thinking it was a ball' - Children of the Bombs - BBC World Service Documentaries

LONDON: Children maimed by crude bombs used by political activists during election campaigns in West Bengal have appeared in a BBC documentary, “Children of the Bombs”, broadcast on Tuesday which reveals that at least 565 children have been killed, maimed or injured by such bombs in West Bengal since 1996 when Bengali musician Kabir Suman wrote “Howzzat”.That song was inspired by a blast in a park in Kolkata in 1996 in which Puchi was injured aged nine. He recalls how he and four friends were playing cricket and found some balls in a bag which they thought were cricket balls. “When I hit that ball with my bat, immediately there was a blast,” he said.The parents describe finding their kids, one with no eyes, covered in blood. Two of them died. The father of Gopal who died, Bablu Biswas, said he only identified his son by his flower-shaped trouser button.Avijit Mondal, Puchu’s friend, told the BBC Eye documentary: “Election means fear and riots. Why does this always affect people from the slums? Someone’s life gets wasted for just a few votes.”“Extreme abuse of childhood and adolescence is going on. If I was the chief minister of the state, I would put an end to this. Forever. I would be merciless and ruthless against the mob,” said Pankaj Dutta, former IGP,West Bengal,who died on Nov 30, after giving the interview.Poulami appears in the BBC World Service documentary. She lost her hand aged seven in 2018 when she picked up an object which she thought was a ball and it exploded, blowing her fingers off.Dutta tells the documentary the use of bombs became an accepted feature of politics in West Bengal after the 1946 Calcutta Riots but the genesis of bomb-making started in Muraripukur Garden House in Kolkata in 1908 when revolutionaries Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki attempted to kill British magistrate Douglas Kingsford.","At least 565 children have been killed, maimed or injured by such bombs in West Bengal since 1996.

NASHIK: Disgruntled NCP MLA Chhagan Bhujbal on Tuesday said Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Devendra Fadnavis , and two top NCP functionaries, Praful Patel and Sunil Tatkare, ""tried their best"" to convince party president Ajit Pawar to give him a ministerial berth.""All three (Fadnavis, Patel and Tatkare) wanted me as a minister in the new govt.

I don't know why Ajit dada felt I should not be included. It is for him to explain,"" Bhujbal told TOI.He further added that party presidents should run a party in a 'democratic manner' rather than conducting a 'one-man' show.The Yeola MLA said, ""It is not healthy for any party to not listen to other senior members. I am angry not because I was denied a ministerial berth but because of how decisions were made about NCP MLAs who would be ministers. It was not a collective decision. I cannot be taken for granted.""Bhujbal returned to Nashik on Monday night, skipping the assembly session in Nagpur. He also did not attend the swearing-in ceremony of the new ministers in Nagpur on Sunday.""It is ironic that my party bosses now want me to go to Rajya Sabha.

I have decided to follow their advice. Despite the Maratha quota issue, voters, including those from the Maratha community, elected me. I could not ignore their sentiments and have rejected the offer,"" Bhujbal said, adding that he will not resign as MLA since it would be against the mandate.On whether he would quit NCP and join another party, Bhujbal said, ""I will not say anything at this juncture.

JALANDHAR/PATIALA/BATHINDA: The tragic deaths of 11 Indians due to carbon monoxide poisoning at a restaurant in Gudauri in Georgia have shattered several families across Punjab. As they grapple with the loss, their biggest plea now is to bring back the mortal remains to perform the last rites. For them, closure remains a distant hope until their loved ones return home one final time.For Gurmukh Singh of Ghall Kalan village in Moga district, the death of his 24-year-old son Gagandeep Singh has brought irreparable loss. Gagandeep had moved to Georgia just four months ago after working in Dubai for over a year.""On Monday, we were informed that many workers were sleeping in a room with a generator running due to a power outage, which caused the poisoning,"" Gurmukh said on Tuesday.Gurmukh, who has lost two of his three sons and his wife in recent years, is now left alone. ""I last spoke to Gagandeep on Dec 12 and he told me he was happy,"" he said. The father had taken loans amounting to Rs 5 lakh to send his son abroad, only to now face the crushing grief of losing him.Ravinder Kala, a resident of Kot Ramdas in Jalandhar, had been away from his family for over seven years, working in Dubai and later Georgia to secure a better life. He was among the deceased.""He called home around 8.30 the previous night and spoke to our daughters,"" said his wife Kanchan.""He told them about a storm that had knocked out the power and promised to call the next day. That call never came"" she said. ""Around 8pm Sunday, we learned he had never woken up, and 12 people had died.""Kanchan, who lives with her mother-in-law and brothers-in-law, now faces an uncertain future. ""My son, who is seven, was born after Ravinder left for Dubai. He never got to meet his father. We have no means of livelihood now,"" she said urging govt to help bring home her husband's body.Ravinder Singh, 34, and Gurvinder Kaur, 29, from Sangrur district had relocated to Georgia in March 2023.

Ravinder's father Amrik Singh, is a bedridden farmer, while his mother passed away five years ago. Gurvinder's family, too, is devastated by the tragedy.""They had secured jobs at the restaurant,"" said Ravinder's uncle Kuldeep Singh Bawa.

NEW DELHI: In a short ruling, SC said no court can grant bail to persons facing rape charges without hearing the survivor or her parents/guardians, in addition to the public prosecutor, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.Cancelling bail granted by Allahabad HC to persons accused of gang-raping a 14-year-old in Ghaziabad in 2021, Justices Bela M Trivedi and Satish Chandra Sharma expressed concern over HC ignoring provisions of law.The court said the law mandated grant of hearing to the complainant or her parents/guardian in cases relating to sexual assault and offences under SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.Appearing for the father of the minor rape survivor, advocate Pranav Sachdeva said the HC erred gravely on two counts - by not adhering to the mandate of Section 439(1A), which made it compulsory for the accused to implead the rape survivor, and casually enlarging (releasing) the accused in a gang-rape case.Sachdeva cited a 2002 SC judgment in Jagjeet Singh vs Ashish Mishra case, which had said, ""Victims could not be expected to be sitting on the fence and watching the proceedings from afar and that victims had a legally vested right to be heard at every step post the occurrence of an offence.""Accepting his reasoning, the bench said, ""As per Section 439(1A) of CrPC, the presence of the informant or any person authorised by him or her is obligatory at the time of hearing of the application for bail to the person under sub-section (3) of Section 376 or Section 376AB or Section 376DA or Section 376DB of the IPC.""""Similarly, it is also mandatory for the special public prosecutor of the state govt to inform the victim about the court proceedings, including bail proceedings as contemplated in sub-section (3) of Section 15A of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989,"" Justices Trivedi and Sharma said in its order of Dec 13, which was uploaded on SC website on Tuesday.Faulting the HC for ""gross violation"" of mandatory provisions while granting bail to the gang-rape accused, the bench said the HC also granted bail to the accused in ""a very casual and cursory manner without assigning any cogent reasons, though the accused are prima facie involved in a serious offence"".","Court said no court can grant bail to persons facing rape charges without hearing the survivor or her parents/guardians, in addition to the public prosecutor.

Supreme Court: How is ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogan in mosque a crime?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-how-is-jai-shri-ram-slogan-in-mosque-a-crime/articleshow/116379160.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday asked a caretaker to explain how shouting ‘Jai Shri Ram' inside the mosque outraged the religious feelings of his community and became an offence. It, however, sought Karnataka govt's stand on his appeal against quashing of criminal proceedings against the two accused.Appearing for the petitioner, caretaker Haydhar Ali, senior advocate Devadatt Kamat told the bench that shouting such slogans inside a mosque would amount to an attempt to stir communal strife and becomes an offence when accompanied by threat to lives of Muslims.When Kamat, with advocate Javedur Rehman, argued that the HC should have allowed police to complete the probe and not stayed investigations within 20 days of registration of FIR, the bench of Justices Pankaj Mithal and Sandeep Mehta asked, ""Alright, they were shouting a particular religious slogan. How is that an offence?""Kamat said if persons from one faith shouted religious slogans inside the place of worship of another faith, it surely would be an offence. The bench said the FIR was registered based on CCTV footage that detected two persons moving around the mosque.""What is the evidence apart from the CCTV footage to link the two to the incident,"" the bench asked. Kamat said it was for the police to find out who were the persons responsible for disturbing communal harmony and threatening the Muslim community. The bench asked Rehman to serve the petition on the standing counsel for Karnataka to ascertain the state's stand on the appeal by Ali challenging the HC decision.The HC, on Sept 13, had quashed criminal proceedings before a Puttur court in Dakshina Kannada district, saying the FIR did not disclose ingredients of any offence. It was alleged that on Sept 24, 2023, some miscreants entered Badriya Juma Masjid at Aithoor Village, started shouting ‘Jai Shri Ram', and followed with threats that Muslims would not be allowed to live in peace.

Who is KMFDM and Why Are They Controversially Linked to School Shootings?



Megalomaniac

Police Investigate Shooter’s Background and Motive



A Grieving Community Seeks Answers



Unsettling Questions Linger



The recent Abundant Life Christian School shooting in Madison, Wisconsin, has sparked unsettling comparisons to the Columbine High School massacre after a chilling detail emerged: the 15-year-old shooter, Natalie ‘Samantha’ Rupnow , was photographed wearing a shirt identical to one worn by Columbine killer Eric Harris.Rupnow, who killed a teacher and a student before taking her own life, wore a black shirt featuring the distinctive “tumbling logo” design from German industrial band KMFDM’s 1997 Symbols tour. The same band and design are historically tied to the Columbine tragedy, where Harris and co-perpetrator Dylan Klebold also sported KMFDM attire in public photos.Social media users were the first to draw attention to Rupnow’s choice of clothing, with many noting the unsettling similarities to Harris’s infamous appearance. The connection has prompted widespread debate about whether Rupnow’s actions were influenced by Columbine’s enduring legacy or if the link was purely coincidental.According to reports from The New York Post, authorities believe the Madison shooting was a “planned attack,” but they have not yet established a definitive motive. The symbolic shirt, however, has rekindled public discussion about KMFDM’s unintended association with school shootings and its place within a darker subculture.KMFDM, a German industrial band founded in 1984, is known for its aggressive sound that fuses heavy metal, punk, and electronic elements. With themes of rebellion, societal decay, and anti-authoritarianism, their music has long resonated with listeners disillusioned by mainstream norms.The band’s name, “Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid,” translates to “No Pity for the Majority,” encapsulating their confrontational and satirical tone.KMFDM became controversially tied to school shootings following the Columbine massacre in 1999. Eric Harris, one of the shooters, praised the band in his personal writings, citing their “anti-American” and “anti-authoritarian” messages as influential.While KMFDM has consistently condemned violence and rejected associations with such tragedies, their music and imagery have nonetheless become a recurring focal point in discussions surrounding school shootings.Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes confirmed that authorities are examining every aspect of Rupnow’s background for possible influences, including online communities and historical school shooting events. “We are still working to determine a clear motive,” Barnes stated during a press conference. He also addressed reports of an alleged manifesto circulating online, clarifying that its authenticity remains unverified as investigators work with the FBI to confirm its origins.The attack occurred during a study hall session, leaving the tight-knit Christian school community shattered. A teacher and a student were killed, and two additional students remain in critical condition.Authorities confirmed that Rupnow died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound while being transported to the hospital.Parents, students, and community members gathered at local churches Monday evening, mourning the victims and offering prayers for the injured. School official Barbara Wiers commended students for following safety protocols with remarkable composure during the chaos.As investigators search for answers, the eerie detail of Rupnow’s KMFDM shirt continues to cast a shadow over the tragedy. Was her attire a deliberate nod to Columbine, or an unsettling coincidence? Authorities are interviewing Rupnow’s family, who are reportedly cooperating with the investigation, and working to uncover how the teenager obtained the weapon used in the attack.While the investigation progresses, the debate over cultural influences, mental health, and the legacy of past school shootings remains unresolved. For now, a grieving community is left searching for solace—and answers to questions that may never be fully answered.","Natalie ‘Samantha’ Rupnow, 15, killed a teacher and a student before taking her own life at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin.

Des Moines register's reaction to the lawsuit

Previous lawsuits

US President-elect Donald Trump has sued Des Moines Register , its parent company Gannett, and pollster J Ann Selzer over a pre-election poll. The poll, published shortly before the election, showed Trump trailing Vice President Kamala Harris in Iowa by three points. However, Trump won Iowa by a significant margin.The lawsuit , filed Monday in Polk County, Iowa, alleges ""brazen election interference"" and a violation of the Iowa Consumer Fraud Act , which prohibits deceptive practices in sales or advertising.Trump previewed the lawsuit during a Monday news conference in Florida, saying, ""I have to do it. We have to straighten out the press.""The Des Moines survey, carried out by the recently retired pollster J Ann Selzer, was seen as unexpected, as it revealed that Trump’s previous lead in the Republican-leaning state of Iowa had disappeared. In the actual election, Trump won Iowa by more than 13 percentage points.“There was a perfectly good reason nobody saw this coming: because a three-point lead for Harris in deep-red Iowa was not reality,” the lawsuit said. “It was election-interfering fiction.”Trump argued that the poll boosted enthusiasm among Democrats, forced Republicans to divert campaign time and resources to areas where they were already ahead, and misled the public into believing Democrats were performing better than they truly were.The Register, however, has defended its reporting. “We stand by our reporting on the matter and believe a lawsuit would be without merit,” Lark-Marie Anton, Des Moines Register spokeswoman, said.Anton said that the newspaper admitted the pre-election poll did not accurately reflect the results and has since published the full data and a technical explanation of the poll. Anton said they will ""vigorously defend"" their ""First Amendment rights.""Selzer has not yet commented on the lawsuit, but in an interview with PBS in Iowa last week, she said, ""It's not my ethic"" to design a poll to produce a particular outcome. She expressed confusion over what motivation people might believe she had.“To suggest without a single shred of evidence that I was in cahoots with somebody, I was being paid by somebody, it's all just kind of, it's hard to pay too much attention to it except that they are accusing me of a crime,” she said.This lawsuit follows a pattern of legal actions by Trump against media outlets. He recently settled a defamation case with ABC News for $15 million.A professor at the University of Iowa College of Law, Samantha Barbas, commented on Trump’s legal strategy, saying, as quoted by New York Times, ""It's clear that Trump is waging war on the press. Trump and his lawyers are going to use any legal claim that they think has a chance of sticking. They'll cast a wide net to carry out this vendetta."" Barbas also noted the lawsuits “are not so much geared toward winning as much as threatening.”Another lawsuit filed by Trump against CBS News in October also alleges deceptive trade practices related to an interview with Harris. Trump has frequently criticized the press and stated his desire for ""fair"" treatment.","US President-elect Donald Trump has sued Des Moines Register, its parent company Gannett, and pollster J Ann Selzer over a pre-election poll.

Police said that ""multiple factors"" may have motivated the shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison , Wisconsin, which tragically left three dead and six injured. The suspect, 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow , reportedly took her own life after the incident.According to Madison police chief Shon Barnes, a ""combination of factors"" may have led to the shooting, and investigators are interviewing Rupnow's classmates ""to understand whether bullying was one of those multiple factors.""Following the tragedy, a document titled ""War Against Humanity"" has surfaced, allegedly authored by Rupnow. This manifesto, along with her social media posts and personal writings, offers insight into her motivations, mental state, and the warning signs that went unnoticed before the attack.“We are working to authenticate the document that you see online that some are referring to as a manifesto,” Barnes said, as quoted by USA Today, urging people not to share the document until its authenticity is confirmed. He also requested that anyone with knowledge of Rupnow's state of mind prior to the shooting contact the police.Authorities are investigating how Rupnow obtained the handgun used in the shooting and are working with the ATF to trace the weapon. Barnes noted they are also examining potential parental negligence.“We also want to look at if the parents may have been negligent. And that’s a question that we’ll have to answer with our district attorney’s office,” Barnes told CNN. “But at this time, that does not appear to be the case.”Madison mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway declined to provide additional details about the victims, stressing the need for respect and privacy. “It is absolutely none of y’all's business who was harmed in this incident,” she stated. “Just have some human decency, folks. Leave them alone. Let them grieve. Let them recover. Let them heal,” she said. “Don’t feed off their pain. We’ll share what we can when we can and not before that. Thank you.”The shooting at Abundant Life Christian School on Monday left three people dead, including the suspected shooter, and six others injured. Police identified the suspect as 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow , also known as Samantha, a student at the school. Rupnow reportedly opened fire inside a classroom at the K-12 institution, which serves approximately 400 students.According to Barnes, Rupnow died from a suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound while being transported to a local hospital.Among the victims, two students remain in critical condition. Three other students and one teacher were injured, with two already discharged from the hospital.Community members have set up a makeshift memorial of candles and flowers outside the school. Two local school bus drivers, Megan Mojica and Kamila Reynolds, visited the memorial to pray. Reynolds expressed her shock at the violence. “(Madison) is a good town,” she said, as quoted by USA Today. “And for something to happen like this ... it’s surprising.”Mojica, whose son experienced a school shooting in 2019, shared words of support, saying, as quoted by USA Today, “Surround yourself with family and friends, because with time, you will be able to overcome.”","Shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, left three dead and six injured.

Next Steps



A tragic school shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, on Monday claimed the lives of a teacher and a student, leaving two other students critically injured and sparking renewed debates on school safety and gun violence . Police identified 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow , a student at the private Christian academy, as the shooter. Rupnow, who also went by the name Samantha, was found incapacitated when officers arrived just minutes after the 10:57 a.m. 911 call. She was later pronounced dead at a hospital from what authorities suspect was a self-inflicted gunshot wound, though the medical examiner has not confirmed the official cause of death.The violence also resulted in non-life-threatening injuries to three additional students and another teacher, adding to the devastating toll on the tight-knit school community of approximately 420 students. Authorities are actively investigating Rupnow’s background, searching her home, and reviewing her digital footprint for clues to a motive.Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers called the event “heartbreaking,” while President Joe Biden described the shooting as “shocking and unconscionable,” renewing calls for action against the country’s epidemic of school gun violence. With the school days away from its Christmas break, the tragedy has left a community shattered and grappling with unanswered questions.At a December 16 news conference, police identified 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow as the shooter responsible for the fatal attack at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin.Posts and comments from social media accounts linked to Rupnow and her father, Jeff Rupnow, provide a glimpse into her life leading up to the shooting.Jeff Rupnow’s Facebook account includes photos of Natalie as a baby, a smiling child, and participating in activities such as karate competitions, reflecting a seemingly normal upbringing.A notable post from August shows Natalie at a shooting range, wearing protective gear and handling a firearm. When a commenter asked, “Is that kiddo?”, Jeff responded enthusiastically:The NBSC likely refers to the North Bristol Sportsman’s Club, a shooting range in Wisconsin.Natalie Rupnow’s personal social media profiles have been deactivated or set to private. Before their removal, an image from her X (formerly Twitter) account depicted someone wearing combat boots and making the “OK” hand gesture — a symbol often debated for its varied interpretations.Reports of a manifesto allegedly written by Rupnow have been circulating online, but authorities have not confirmed its existence or authenticity. Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes addressed these claims directly:“A document about this shooting is circulating on social media, but we have not verified its authenticity.”Rupnow’s social media presence, including posts of firearm use and controversial imagery, raises questions about:Authorities are actively examining Rupnow’s digital footprint, family background, and social relationships as part of their investigation. With her accounts now offline, investigators will rely on archived activity, communications, and input from family and friends to uncover potential motivations. Further developments are expected in the coming days.","Police identified 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow as the shooter responsible for the fatal attack at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin.

Momeni will a prison sentence of 16 years to life, District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said, quoted by The San Francisco Standard.According to the prosecutors, Momeni had planned the attack after a heated disagreement involving his younger sister. They alleged that Momeni was furious with Lee for introducing his sister to a drug dealer who reportedly gave her GHB, a drug often linked to sexual assault, and assaulted her. It was also claimed that Momeni drove Lee to a secluded area under the Bay Bridge in the early hours of the morning and stabbed him three times with a knife taken from his sister’s kitchen.CCTV footage presented in court showed Lee and Momeni leaving Lee’s hotel around 2 am and getting into Momeni’s BMW. The car was then seen heading to a dark and isolated spot. Prosecutors said Momeni left Lee behind, bleeding, as he drove away at high speed.Momeni’s legal team argued that the stabbing was an act of self-defence during a physical altercation. ABC news quoted Paula Canny, his lawyer, who claimed there was no premeditation, suggesting that Lee, who was intoxicated at the time, attacked Momeni in anger over a joke. Momeni testified that he teased Lee about preferring to spend his last night in town with his family rather than going to a strip club, which escalated the situation.The jury, however, sided with the prosecution, rejecting the self-defence claim.

"Hush money case: 'No immunity for unofficial acts,' Judge rejects Donald Trump’s bid to dismiss conviction",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hush-money-case-no-immunity-for-unofficial-acts-judge-rejects-donald-trumps-bid-to-dismiss-conviction/articleshow/116383520.cms,"'This lawless case should be immediately dismissed,' Trump’s team reacts as immunity defense is denied

The hush money case

A New York judge ruled on Tuesday against a bid by US President-elect Donald Trump to have his hush money conviction thrown out, rejecting his argument that a recent Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity applied to the case.Judge Juan Merchan ruled that the immunity granted to presidents for official acts did not extend to the conduct involved in Trump’s conviction, which related to ""entirely unofficial conduct entitled to no immunity protections.""“Defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment and vacate the jury verdict... is denied,” Merchan stated, meaning that Trump’s conviction stands.Trump had sought to have the case moved to federal court, arguing that his position as president-elect warranted the dismissal of the conviction. His lawyers also presented arguments based on a July Supreme Court decision that grants presidents immunity from prosecution for actions taken during their presidency. They claimed that certain evidence presented at trial, including Trump’s financial disclosure form, social media posts, and testimony from White House aides, should have been excluded. However, Judge Merchan disagreed, ruling that even if some of the evidence related to official acts, it did not affect the case, which focused on falsifying business records .Trump’s conviction stems from a $130,000 payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016, which prosecutors say was intended to cover up an alleged affair with Trump during the presidential campaign. The payments were aimed at protecting Trump’s election chances, prosecutors argued. Trump, however, has denied the affair and any wrongdoing.The ruling brings Trump closer to becoming the first president to enter the White House with a felony conviction, pending an appeal. His legal team has vowed to continue challenging the verdict, including raising issues of potential juror misconduct.As Trump faces the prospect of returning to office next month, the case is likely to continue as a source of legal and political controversy. Trump's communications director, Steven Cheung, slammed the case, saying, “This lawless case should have never been brought, and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed.”Prosecutors have argued that Trump’s bid to dismiss the case went too far, with their office stating, ""Multiple accommodations well short of dismissal... would satisfy that objective, including a stay of proceedings during his term in office.""The case continues to unfold as Trump navigates his legal challenges, with the potential for further legal battles as he prepares to take office once again.","Donald Trump's bid to have his hush money conviction thrown out was denied on Tuesday.

Liberal MPs call emergency meeting

Freeland’s resignation rocks Trudeau’s cabinet

What is Prorogation?

Growing criticism and party divisions

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is reportedly considering stepping down amid growing speculation over his political future and a deepening crisis within the Liberal Party. According to trading platform Polymarket, there is now an 80% chance Trudeau will resign before April, as calls for his departure intensify among Canadian leaders and his own party.Besides, according to the sources by CTV News, Trudeau is weighing his options, including resignation or proroguing Parliament, with an announcement expected soon.Trudeau reportedly informed his cabinet and MPs about his intentions to address the situation, following the abrupt resignation of finance minister Chrystia Freeland, which has deepened the instability within his administration.Freeland accused the Prime Minister of engaging in ""costly political gimmicks"" for personal benefit rather than addressing Canada’s mounting economic challenges.On Monday night, Liberal MPs called an emergency caucus meeting, boarding up the room to keep proceedings behind closed doors. Trudeau was seen attending the meeting, according to CTV News. The Prime Minister has yet to publicly comment on Freeland’s resignation or the mounting pressure to step aside.The dramatic events follow weeks of criticism from opposition parties and within Trudeau’s own ranks. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre intensified his attacks, calling Trudeau’s leadership “out of control.” Poilievre’s remarks resonate as Trudeau lags 20 points behind the Conservatives in national polls.Dalhousie University professor Lori Turnbull described the situation as “a total disaster” for the Liberal Party. “It makes it much harder for Trudeau to continue as prime minister,” she added.Chrystia Freeland, Canada's deputy prime minister and finance minister, announced her resignation, citing irreconcilable differences with Trudeau on the country’s future. In her resignation letter, Freeland revealed that Trudeau had expressed intentions to replace her and offered another cabinet role, which she declined.“Upon reflection, I have concluded that the only honest and viable path is for me to resign,” Freeland stated. She pointed to weeks of disagreements and a lack of alignment with Trudeau on critical policy issues.Freeland's resignation comes amid Trudeau's declining popularity and growing dissent within the Liberal Party. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre seized the moment, declaring that “Canada is out of control” under Trudeau’s leadership.Prorogation, a procedural tool in parliamentary systems, terminates a session of Parliament at the recommendation of the Prime Minister. This measure essentially “resets” legislative proceedings, halting all pending bills and committee activities until a new session begins. While often used to refocus government priorities, it can also serve as a political strategy during periods of instability.Freeland’s resignation underscores the mounting challenges Trudeau faces, including internal divisions and external crises like a trade war with the United States. In her resignation, Freeland warned of looming fiscal challenges and criticized “costly political gimmicks” aimed at boosting the Liberals’ waning fortunes.Party leader Jagmeet Singh had earlier been less equivocal when asked about bringing down Trudeau, whom he insisted should resign.Lori Turnbull, a professor at Dalhousie University, described Freeland’s exit as “a total disaster” for Trudeau. “It shows a crisis of confidence in his leadership,” she said, adding that the cabinet’s unity is now in question.Despite calls for a reset, Trudeau’s office dismissed rumors of his resignation, stating they are “absolutely not accurate.” However, with Finance Minister Sean Fraser also resigning and growing opposition from both his party and rivals, Trudeau’s path forward remains uncertain.The political landscape remains volatile, with the next parliamentary election expected by October 2025. Freeland has announced her intention to run, while Trudeau has maintained his plan to lead the Liberals into the next election.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is reportedly considering stepping down amid growing speculation over his political future.

Wisconsin School Shooting: Why gender debate overshadowed tragedy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wisconsin-school-shooting-why-gender-debate-overshadowed-tragedy/articleshow/116405491.cms,"“She, He, or They”: Chief Barnes’ Comments Ignite Outrage



Social Media Divides Over Barnes’ Neutral Stance



Supporters Defend Chief Barnes’ Approach



The Real Tragedy: Gun Violence and Its Victims



A Broader Divide: Identity Politics vs. Action



Moving Forward: Tragedy Amid Polarization



A devastating shooting at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, left two dead and six injured, shocking the nation. In the aftermath of the violence, an unexpected controversy erupted—not about the shooter’s actions, but over their gender identity.The shooter, identified as 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow , who was also known as Samantha, opened fire in a study hall before taking their own life. During a press conference shortly after the tragedy, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes addressed questions about the shooter’s gender, sparking widespread debate on social media.When asked directly whether Rupnow was transgender, Chief Barnes replied: ""I don’t know whether the shooter was transgender or not. I don’t think that whatever happened today has anything to do with how she or he or they may have wanted to identify. And I wish people would leave their personal biases out of this.""He added: ""Whether or not she was, he was, or they were transgender is something that may come out later. But right now, eight hours after a mass shooting in a Madison school, it is of no consequence.""While Barnes’ comments appeared aimed at steering attention away from identity and toward the tragedy itself, they instead triggered fierce criticism. Many accused him of evading the question and prioritizing political correctness.Social media quickly erupted with outrage. Critics argued that Barnes’ choice to use multiple pronouns muddled the conversation.“Even in the middle of a tragedy, they’re prioritizing political correctness over facts. This is what’s wrong with society today,” one user wrote. “Why dodge the question? Understanding the shooter’s identity could help explain their motives,” another added.“The woke brigade strikes again. It’s a mass shooting, and the police chief sounds like he’s leading a sensitivity workshop,” mocked one commenter. Some users speculated that the hesitation to clarify Rupnow’s gender identity reflected a broader agenda. “They always delay when the shooter might be transgender,” one commenter claimed, citing other shootings that faced similar scrutiny.Amid the backlash, others defended Barnes, arguing that his comments had been taken out of context or constrained by legal protocols for handling minors. “He’s just following the law. You can’t release details about minors unless they’re being charged as adults,” one user explained. “Barnes didn’t say all those pronouns to confuse anyone. He meant it doesn’t matter right now, and critics are twisting his words,” another countered. Defenders also argued that focusing on gender identity detracted from the more pressing issue: the lives lost and the need for meaningful action on gun violence .As debates about pronouns intensified, the tragic reality of the shooting risked being overshadowed. The attack claimed the lives of a teacher and a student, leaving six others injured. Chaos unfolded as students sheltered in place, with a second grader reportedly placing the 911 call that brought first responders to the scene.President Joe Biden addressed the nation following the tragedy, renewing calls for stricter gun laws: ""It is unacceptable that we are unable to protect our children from the scourge of gun violence. We cannot continue to accept this as normal.""The gender identity controversy has once again exposed the deep political and cultural divides in the United States. For some, the debate symbolizes an erosion of clarity and trust.“Why do they try so hard to confuse people? It immediately makes me question their transparency,” one frustrated user remarked.Others pushed back, arguing that identity discussions served as a distraction: “The outrage over pronouns is misplaced. Children and teachers were shot—why are we talking about anything else?”The Wisconsin shooting highlights how even moments of profound grief can become entangled in divisive debates. While families mourn, the focus has shifted from addressing the root causes of gun violence to cultural conflicts over identity and language. The challenge remains: how can communities and leaders focus on solutions to prevent mass violence while avoiding polarizing debates that distract from meaningful action? As the investigation continues, Chief Barnes’ response serves as a reminder of the ongoing tension between clarity, sensitivity, and public expectations in the face of tragedy.",Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes' response to questions about the shooter's gender sparked widespread debate on social media. Critics accused him of evading the question and prioritizing political correctness.

Her partial remains were discovered in Manorville, New York, when hunters discovered a suspicious black bag that November, Fox News reported.Investigators are currently analysing DNA evidence using advanced techniques, which the defence intends to contest, according to informed sources.""Your honor, I am not guilty on any of these charges,"" Heuermann declared in court on Tuesday, whilst wearing a dark suit and handcuffed.The New York City architect's arrest occurred outside his Manhattan workplace in July 2023. This followed a decade-long investigation that began with a search for a missing person 45 miles east of Gilgo Beach, leading to the discovery of 10 additional bodies, including more of Mack's remains.Initially, authorities charged him with killing Melissa Barthelemy, 24, Megan Waterman, 22, and Amber Costello, 27. A dedicated task force later uncovered additional evidence.In January, he was charged with Maureen Brainard-Barnes ' murder, aged 25.A grand jury subsequently indicted Heuermann in June for the deaths of Jessica Taylor, 20, and Sandra Costilla, 28.Similar to Taylor's case, Mack's dismembered remains were found in two locations: Ocean Parkway near Gilgo Beach and Manorville, approximately 50 miles apart.Law enforcement in three additional states are investigating unsolved cases for possible links to Heuermann.Heuermann maintains his innocence regarding previous charges and remains in custody at Suffolk County Jail, Riverhead, New York.Prosecutors describe the 60-year-old architect as leading a dual existence: a professional Manhattan commuter by day and an alleged exploiter of sex workers during his free time.Investigators found DNA from his now-estranged wife at a crime scene, though they believe it was transferred there by the perpetrator. According to District Attorney Ray Tierney, Heuermann's family was away during the murders.His wife, Asa Ellerup, initiated divorce proceedings after his arrest but maintains his innocence and awaits the trial outcome.Heuermann's next court appearance is scheduled for January 15.","The New York City architect's arrest occurred outside his Manhattan workplace in July 2023.

What’s next

Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been allowed to review heart tissue and fluid samples from George Floyd ’s autopsy. This decision, issued by US district judge Paul Magnuson, is part of Chauvin’s effort to appeal his federal civil rights conviction . His legal team argues that Floyd’s death was caused by a pre-existing heart condition rather than the actions of the former officer.Lawyers for Derek Chauvin, the disgraced Minneapolis police officer convicted of murdering George Floyd back in 2020, have won the rights and are allowed to review heart tissue and fluid samples from his autopsy.In 2020, Chauvin was found as the murderer of convicted George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man. According to a video, the former officer was seen pressing his knee to the detained African-American man's neck.This decision, issued by US district judge Paul Magnuson, is part of Chauvin’s effort to appeal his federal civil rights conviction. His legal team argues that Floyd’s death was caused by a pre-existing heart condition rather than the actions of the former officer.“Given the significant nature of the criminal case that Mr. Chauvin was convicted of, and given that the discovery that Mr Chauvin seeks could support Dr Schaetzel’s opinion of how Mr Floyd died, the Court finds that there is good cause to allow Mr Chauvin to take the discovery that he seeks,” Magnuson stated, quoted by news agency Gazettextra.Floyd, 46, died on 25 May 2020 after Chauvin, who is white, knelt on Floyd’s neck for over nine minutes during an arrest.The video of the incident showed Floyd repeatedly stating that he couldn’t breathe. His death led to global protests demanding an end to police brutality and racial injustice.The Hennepin County medical examiner ruled Floyd’s death a homicide, citing “cardiopulmonary arrest” due to “restraint and neck compression” compounded by pre-existing heart conditions, including severe atherosclerosis and hypertension.Despite this, Chauvin’s defence contends that Floyd’s death may have been due to a heart condition known as takotsubo cardiomyopathy, triggered by stress rather than Chauvin’s actions.Chauvin, sentenced to 22 and a half years in state prison for second-degree murder, also pleaded guilty to federal charges of violating Floyd’s civil rights, resulting in a 21-year federal prison sentence to be served concurrently.Now, his legal team is challenging his federal conviction alleging lack of counsel assistance.According to court filings it was alleged that Chauvin’s original defence attorney, Eric Nelson, failed to pursue evidence from Dr. William Schaetzel, a forensic pathologist, who believed that Chauvin’s actions did not directly result in Floyd’s death.Judge Magnuson ruled that Chauvin’s team could access histology slides, tissue samples, and photographs from Floyd’s autopsy to examine if there is evidence supporting the claim of an undiagnosed heart condition.Chauvin’s convictions were a significant step in holding police accountable for the deaths of unarmed individuals. Prosecutors argue that the claims of ineffective counsel are invalid, calling Schaetzel’s opinion unnecessary and repetitive.Ben Crump, the attorney for George Floyd’s family, said ""A judge ruled that Derek Chauvin's lawyers may test preserved samples of George Floyd's heart, challenging his federal conviction. Nothing changes what we all watched: His knee on George Floyd's neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds.""As Chauvin’s team proceeds with its examination of the autopsy materials, the legal process continues. Chauvin would still serve the remainder of his state sentence, even if his federal conviction is overturned, with his earliest possible release a decade later in 2037 according to US Bureau of Prisons, quoted by news agency Newsweek.","Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been allowed to review heart tissue and fluid samples from George Floyd ’s autopsy.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in last year’s May 9 riots when protesters linked to the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) had stormed govt and military installations.A seven-member SC constitution bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin, specified that the military court verdicts would be subject to its final decision on appeals against its Oct 23, 2023 ruling barring the army from trying PTI protesters, saying military trials of civilians were unconstitutional.Local and international human rights organisations have expressed concern about the military trials, claiming that they do not adhere to the same evidentiary and due process norms as civilian courtsHundreds of PTI workers were arrested after they purportedly stormed military and govt buildings, and even torched a top commander’s house, following the former PM’s brief arrest by paramilitary soldiers on May 9, 2023 in a graft case. Among the detainees, the army initiated military trials against 103 accused on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military. Though Khan was released after three days, he was rearrested two months later in another corruption case and has been in jail since. There have been widespread reports that the military also plans to prosecute him under the same charges. He, however, has already been indicted by an anti-terrorism court over charges linked to the May 9 riots.The seven-member SC constitution bench was formed as a result of a controversial amendment to the constitution in Oct this year.“The final judgment of 85 persons who are under custody and facing trial before the military courts be announced and remissions admissible to the said persons be granted, and persons who can be released after remissions they be released forthwith, and persons who have to yet undergo the sentence awarded to them, their custody be handed over to the concerned jail authorities,” Friday’s court order read.The Pakistan Army Act of 1952 had established military courts, which function under a separate legal system, primarily for trial of military personnel or enemies of the state.The decision to use military courts for civilians was taken by Imran’sadversary, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during his first term in office, and was backed by the powerful military establishment.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in May 9 riots.

Bin Laden, Tehran and the Taliban



'Murdered my dreams'



PARACHINAR: Once again, Ali Ghulam receives mourners at his home -- his brother and nephew killed 40 years apart in the same sectarian conflict that was reignited this year in northwest Pakistan, claiming 200 lives since July alone.Thousands of residents are stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district, which borders Afghanistan, as the government struggles to end clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stemming from decades-old tensions over farmland.""Our generations yearn for peace,"" 72-year-old Ghulam told AFP at his home in Parachinar, the main town and a Shiite bastion of the restive district.The latest flare-up of violence has ""reopened wounds"" he said, recalling how his brother was killed in an attack in 1987 that also wounded another three of his brothers.Kurram, known as the ""Parrot's Beak"" for its protrusion into neighbouring Afghanistan, is bounded by dizzyingly high mountains, the northern flank of which includes the Tora Bora caves where Al Qaeda founder and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden once hid.Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for various militant groups, with militants and weapons able to flow largely unchecked in and out of Afghanistan.""I have never experienced peace in my life and have no hope my coming generations will live free of fear,"" Ghulam said.Tribal and family feuds are common in Pakistan.But they can be particularly protracted and violent in the mountainous tribal northwest, where communities live by traditional codes of honour and revenge.The latest round of violence in Kurram erupted in May and intensified in July, when gunmen opened fire on a council of elders attempting to settle the latest round of disagreements over land.Various truces announced since then have held for only weeks or days at a time.More than 300 shops and over 200 homes in Sunni areas have been destroyed, often by fire, and hundreds of families have fled.Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country with Shiites making up 10 to 15 percent of the population, or at least 25 million people.Members of the two sects have periodically clashed in Kurram, where Shiites are particularly vulnerable as they must pass through Sunni-majority neighbourhoods to access essential services.Kurram's location on the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan put it at the heart of the religious and political upheavals of the last five decades.In 1979, Shiites led a revolution in Iran and later that year the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, prompting Sunni hardliners there to rise up against them.Pakistan's military ruler Zia-ul-Haq aligned with them, funnelling thousands of Sunni militants into Afghanistan through Kurram.""It became a hub for arms supply to Afghanistan, including landmines, mortar shells, and weapons of all kinds. Every household in Kurram had a stockpile of weapons,"" Malik Attaullah Khan, a local tribal elder told AFP.Khan, who signed a 2007 agreement aimed at bringing peace to Kurram, criticised the government for failing to ""fulfil in its responsibilities"" in enforcing land settlements.The ethnic Pashtun heartland was merged into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in 2018, but the Pakistani state maintains limited control in the merged districts.In rural areas of Pakistan, villages often bypass the formal justice system and men-only ""jirgas"" or councils made up of respected village elders resolve disputes, sometimes in the form of fines or land reallocation.Ghulam's nephew was killed along with at least 42 others last month, when Sunni gunmen opened fire on a convoy of Shiites being escorted by the police to their homes.In retaliation, a market in a Sunni-dominated area was set on fire.Syed Ghani Shah told AFP his cousin was burned to death inside his shop.""When we buried him, he was so unrecognisable that we couldn't even let his parents see his face,"" Shah said.""Can we ever make peace after all this? Never, if we ever get the chance, we will surely avenge our blood,"" he warned.Authorities have enforced curfews and road closures to reduce the chances of violence breaking out, providing escorts through high-risk areas and using helicopters to deliver supplies.But Akbar Khan, a representative of Pakistan's independent Human Rights Commission told AFP that the state needs to do more to resolve the issue.""In the past, jirgas were successful because they had the full support of the state. Now, the authorities don't even provide the expenses needed to hold a jirga,"" he said.Fatima Ahmed's husband was killed last month while travelling to Islamabad to arrange her admission to medical college.""I don't want to live a life without him. I've lost my will to exist,"" the 21-year-old told AFP.""They haven't just martyred my husband -- they've also murdered my dreams with him,"" she said, bursting into tears.",Violence in northwest Pakistan has killed 200 people since July.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges, including engaging in political activities and violating a law on official secrets, during field general court martial (FGCM) proceedings against him, military's media affairs wing said Tuesday.Army's media arm ISPR said FGCM also charged Hameed with compromising state security and interests, abusing authority and resources and causing undue harm to individuals. ISPR said proceedings against Hameed were initiated on Aug 12 under provisions of Pakistan Army Act.Hameed, who served as ISI director-general from June 2019 to Oct 2021, was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. He was arrested over accusations about his involvement in land grabbing and snatching valuables and property from the owner of a private housing society. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable in a country where powerful generals have long wielded unparalleled influence in state affairs.""During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (Retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading up to multiple incidents including but not limited to the May 9, 2023 incident for fomenting instability, at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,"" ISPR said. The May 9 incident referred to countrywide protests when PTI supporters stormed army installations and govt buildings following the arrest of party chief and ex-PM Imran Khan for alleged graft. To many, Hameed's close association with Khan was the reason behind his arrest. Khan wanted to continue with Hameed as ISI head but then army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had been adamant on replacing him. Bajwa eventually succeeded and Khan could serve only a few months in office; he was later removed through a no-confidence.Independent observers say action against Hameed could put Khan under pressure and pave the way for the ex-PM to face a military court on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military.","Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries.

Bangladesh HC gives legal validity to Yunus govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-hc-gives-legal-validity-to-yunus-govt/articleshow/116414228.cms,"Bangladesh HC restores caretaker govt system & referendum provision

DHAKA: The Bangladesh HC scrapped on Tuesday a section of 15th Amendment Act of the Constitution, which had abolished the non-party caretaker govt system, even as it clarified that current Yunus-led interim govt does not fall in this category, reports Ahsan Tasnim. The HC also reinstated the provision for holding referendums on constitutional amendments.Giving Yunus's interim govt legal validity, the HC said it is ""totally different"" as it was formed by the president after he sought the opinion of the appellate division of the Supreme Court.The Bangladesh high court scrapped on Tuesday a section of the 15th Amendment Act of the constitution, which had abolished the non-party caretaker govt system, even as it clarified that the current Yunus-led interim govt does not fall in this category.Also, in a significant step, the court revived the provision of holding referendums in case of bringing any amendment to the constitution.Giving Yunus's interim govt legal validity, the HC said it is ""totally different"" as it was formed by the president after he sought the opinion of the appellate division of the Supreme Court under Article 106 of Bangladesh's constitution. Article 106 says: ""If at any time it appears to the President that a question of law has arisen, or is likely to arise, which is of such a nature and of such public importance that it is expedient to obtain the opinion of the Supreme Court upon it, he may refer the question to the appellate division for consideration and the division may, after such hearing as it thinks fit, report its opinion thereon to the President.""The HC ruled that abolishing the non-party caretaker govt system was unconstitutional and void as it undermined democracy, free and fair elections, and judicial independence - fundamental pillars of the constitution's basic structure. The court remarked that restoration of the caretaker govt system will pave the way for holding elections under a non-partisan govt.Tuesday's verdict scrapped the parts of the 15th Amendment Act, which scrapped the 13th amendment that had introduced the non-party caretaker govt system in 1996, and brought significant changes to the charter. The court, however, did not interfere with the provisions of the 15th Amendment Act that deal with state principles, including secularism, socialism, state region, nationalism, Father of the Nation, and number of reserved seats for women in parliament, saying that future govts will take decisions on these issues.BNP said the restoration of the caretaker govt system fulfilled people's expectations.

He described this year's 54th Vijay Diwas celebrations, that led to the country’s liberation in 1971, as particularly significant after her removal as prime minister.""I recall the millions of martyrs including numerous children and juveniles, youths and the elderly people's sacrifices that made possible the achievement of our independence,"" Yunus said in a televised speech, news agency PTI reported.Yunus emphasised that the removal of the ""world's worst autocratic government (Hasina's Awami League regime)"" and its subsequent flight amid a mass uprising added extra significance to this year’s celebration.The 84-year-old Yunus continued, ""Because of our faults we could not give completeness to our achievements"" and of late a ""monstrous autocratic government had grabbed the country which virtually promised that it will not allow anything to remain which could benefit the country"".In his address, however, Yunus made no reference to the political leadership of 1971 or the country’s founding leader, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.Earlier in the day, in a statement marking the defeat of Pakistani forces in Bangladesh’s Liberation War of 1971, deposed PM Sheikh Hasina referred to the interim government led by Yunus as an ""undemocratic group"" that is ""secretly supporting anti-liberation extremist-communal forces.""She condemned the Nobel laureate Yunus, calling him a ""fascist"" seeking to suppress the spirit of the Liberation War and pro-liberation forces.""This undemocratic group, led by the fascist Yunus, has no responsibility towards the people.

NEW DELHI: Muhammad Yunus, leading Bangladesh’s interim government after the ousting of Sheikh Hasina , announced on Monday that general elections could take place by late 2025 or early 2026.

Her administration faced allegations of using the judiciary and civil service for political gain, rigging elections, and undermining democratic governance.During her 15-year tenure, Hasina was accused of extensive human rights violations, including the mass arrests and extrajudicial killings of political opponents.Yunus has initiated commissions to oversee significant reforms, noting that the timeline for elections will depend on agreements reached among political parties.""Throughout, I have emphasised that reforms should take place first before the arrangements for an election,"" he said.""If the political parties agree to hold the election on an earlier date with minimum reforms, such as having a flawless voter list, the election could be held by the end of November,"" he added.But including the full list of electoral reforms would delay polls by a few months, he said.Meanwhile ,Sheikh Hasina called the interim government an ""undemocratic group"" that is ""secretly supporting anti-liberation extremist-communal forces.""In a statement to commemorate the defeat of Pakistani forces in Bangladesh’s Liberation War of 1971, Hasina dubbed Muhammad Yunus as a ""fascist"" seeking to stifle the spirit of the Liberation War and pro-liberation forces.The statement released by her party revolved around the role of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and the Awami League in the struggle that culminated in the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971.""This undemocratic group, led by the fascist Yunus, has no responsibility towards the people,"" she said.

The Allegations



'H6'



Yang's denial



Prince Andrew's role



China responds



A Chinese businessman with close ties to Prince Andrew has denied allegations of espionage after being named by British authorities as a suspected Chinese agent.Yang Tengbo , previously granted anonymity, waived his right on Monday to publicly respond to the accusations.Yang, 50, has been accused by Britain’s home office of working for the United Front Work Department (UFWD), an arm of China’s Communist Party that reportedly builds ties with influential individuals worldwide. Authorities allege Yang engaged in “covert and deceptive activity” on behalf of the UFWD and posed a national security threat .Judges sided with M15, Britain's domestic intelligence, saying that Yang ""represented a risk to national security"" and dismissed his appeal.The SIAC disclosed that in 2021, authorities discovered documents highlighting Yang's close relationship with Prince Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III.In February 2023, Yang was removed from a flight from Beijing to London and subsequently banned from entering the UK. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) upheld the ban last Thursday, bringing his links to Prince Andrew into public view for the first time.The Chinese national, referred as ""H6"" in British espionage and media circles. H6 is believed to be among more than 40,000 operatives linked to the department operating across the globe.Responding to the allegations, Yang insisted he was innocent: “I have done nothing wrong or unlawful, and the concerns raised by the home office against me are ill-founded. The widespread description of me as a ‘spy’ is entirely untrue.”His lawyer, Guy Vassall-Adams, sidelined the claims and confirmed Yang waived his anonymity to defend his reputation.SIAC’s ruling revealed that evidence from Yang’s phone showed Prince Andrew had authorised him to establish an “international financial initiative” to engage with Chinese investors. However, the ruling provided no details about the purpose of the fund.On Friday, Prince Andrew said he had “ceased all contact” with Yang once concerns about the businessman were brought to his attention. Requests for further comment from the Prince’s office remain unanswered.China's foreign ministry dismissed the accusations, calling them groundless. A spokesperson said, ""China has lways been open and above board and has never engaged in deception or interference. Such speculation is not worth refuting.""","Yang Tengbo, previously granted anonymity, waived his right on Monday to publicly respond to the accusations.

Tory peer faces House suspension after calling Indian-origin member 'Lord Poppadom',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/tory-peer-faces-suspension-for-lord-poppadom-jibe/articleshow/116379793.cms,"(L-R) Lord Popat, Baroness Catherine Meyer and Lord Dholakia.

TOI correspondent from London:

A Tory member of the House of Lords is facing suspension for referring to a fellow peer of Indian origin, Lord Dholakia , as “Lord Poppadom”, during a trip to Rwanda in February. The Lords' Conduct Committee recommended a three-week suspension for Baroness Catherine Meyer , 71, and bespoke behaviour training for comments amounting to harassment “related to race”. She has also been rebuked for touching a black MP’s hair without consent.Meyer, the widow of former British ambassador to the US, Sir Christopher Meyer, initially denied using the term “Lord Poppadom” for Dholakia, a Tanzania-born Liberal Democrat, but later conceded she had drunk three glasses of wine and, “It is possible I said it, but I don’t remember”.The Tory peer also admitted to touching the braids of Bell Ribeiro-Addy, a black Labour MP, during the same visit, without her consent. Meyer said she was unaware it would be considered racist.The recommendations of the conduct committee will be voted on in the House of Lords.Meyer is accused of referring to Dholakia as “Lord Poppadom” twice during a taxi journey on the Rwanda trip with the UK Parliament’s Joint Committee on Human Rights.Meyer admitted that during a meeting in Kigali she had mistakenly referred to Dholakia as “Lord Popat”. She said she apologised twice for the slip and on the second occasion another member of the delegation misheard the apology to Dholakia and asked: “Did I just hear you call him Lord Poppadom? Is this how we should address him from now on?” Meyers said Dholakia seemed amused at this.She said she recalled Ribeiro-Addy telling her in the taxi that calling Dholakia “Lord Poppadom” was racist and said she replied it was all meant as a joke. “I never called him the name Poppadom a single time,” she initially said.However, Ribeiro-Addy said in her evidence that she heard Meyer call Dholakia “Lord Poppadom” “more than once”.Dholakia, who submitted a formal complaint against Meyer to the House’s commissioners for standards, Martin Jelley, said he did not hear Meyer call him “Lord Poppadom”, but other members of the trip told him that she had called him that and he felt “shocked” and “very uncomfortable”.The commissioner concluded, on the balance of probabilities, that Meyer had twice referred to Dholakia as “Lord Poppadom”.Meanwhile, Ribeiro-Addy, who made a separate complaint against Meyer to the commissioner about the baroness touching her hair, said the incident left her very upset as it emphasised the idea black hair is a novelty.“She asked for my consent. I did not grant it. She did it anyway… It’s that feeling that you can do whatever you want; you own me,” Ribeiro-Addy said.","Lords' Conduct Committee recommended three-week suspension for Baroness Catherine Meyer.
