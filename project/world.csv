Students are sitting there, we are going to meet them. Gandhi Maidan is a public place, people go there every day. If the students do not have any place, they will go to a public place. I don't know why the government has made it a question of its prestige, somewhere they are harming themselves.""He further added: ""Bihar is the mother of democracy and if the students here do not have the right to speak their minds, then this is becoming a 'lathi-tantra'... that's why we are with the students.""Kishor, also addressing the crowd, announced that a five-member student delegation would meet with the chief secretary to discuss their demands.""Officials confirmed their willingness to engage in discussions. If no substantial decisions are made, students will resume protests on Monday,"" he said, urging the demonstrators to pause their agitation temporarily.Despite Kishor's appeal, the protesters continued marching towards the chief minister's residence, resulting in scuffles with police and subsequent baton charges.

Many people are badly injured in this... We condemn this. The visuals that have surfaced are painful. I am a youth, and I can understand their situation. Firstly, people were protesting against normalisation,"" the former Bihar deputy chief minister said in a video statement.The leader further said: ""On 15-16 December, BPSC announced the cancellation of the exam at one centre. If the paper had been leaked, then why is the exam being cancelled only at one centre? It is a kind of normalisation... That's why students are protesting for a re-examination. I also support this,"" the RJD leader said.",Poll-strategist turned politician Prashant Kishore joined the student protestors. Protesters are demanding the cancellation of Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) exams.

The volunteers check every vehicle coming to the protest site, note down the registration number, and check identity of those in the vehicle. The tractor-trailers around Dallewal's chamber have been welded together to prevent any vehicles from approaching it.SC had Saturday asked Punjab government to file an affidavit outlining the compliance on providing medical aid to Dallewal. The court will take up the matter on December 31. Farmers maintain that the court has taken a strict view on medical aid to Dallewal, but the letters written by Dallewal to the President, PM, and CJI have been ignored.Farmer Abhimanyu Kohad said their protest is based on non-violent principles, and going by it, Dallewal is facing hardships on his body. He urged SC not to give such hard directions and pointed out that in the event of something government untoward happening, Centre and constitutional institutions will also be held responsible.In a bid to prevail upon Dallewal to accept medical aid and to assess the situation, retired ADGP Jaskaran Singh, retired DIG Narinder Bhargav, Patiala Range DIG Mandeep Singh Sidhu, and Patiala SSP Nanak Singh held a meeting with farmers at Khanauri.Amid this, the farmers Sunday readied for December 30 Punjab bandh.

Will Dalai Lama name successor on birthday?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-dalai-lama-name-successor-on-birthday/articleshow/116777055.cms,"DHARAMSHALA: With Dalai Lama's 90th birthday approaching, excitement is growing over whether he will mark the occasion by announcing his successor as the leader of his people and a symbol of their challenge to China's determination to erase their identity as a community.Dalai Lama will turn 90 on July 6, a milestone which many consider to be the right time for the anointment of a new leader of the institution which is now seen as the sole source of resistance, if only symbolic, to China's annexation of Tibet. As preparations are in full swing at McLeodganj, the headquarters of the Tibetan govt in exile - Central Tibetan Administration as it has styled itself - to make it a grand affair with dignitaries and celebrities from across the world likely to witness the ceremony, the question uppermost on many minds is will Dalai Lama mark the occasion by declaring whom he considers to be his reincarnation. What has invested the event with significance is the Tibetan leader's declared wish to break the suspense from the soil of a ""free country"".Fulfilling it will only inflame China's annoyance given the stand of the Communist brass in Beijing that the announcement ought to be made from Chinese territory and with their concurrence.With the Panchen Lama, the second-highest ranking spiritual leader in Tibetan Buddhism after the Dalai Lama, being in Chinese confinement, the task to validate a successor seems to have become even more complicated.As per past practice, the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama put their final seal of approval after identifying each other's reincarnation. There is also a possibility the Dalai Lama may declare there will be no reincarnation after him, as some officials of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) believe. Norzin Dolma, minister in the Tibetan govt (CTA), said, ""His Holiness had written that at 90 years, he will consult Buddhist groups whether this institution should be continued. We have also come out with a paper reiterating 2011 documents. And that China has no role in it."" She, however, said there is no urgency for the announcement as the Dalai Lama has repeatedly said he will live till 110 years of age.The disquiet in the Tibetan administration is obvious given the recent resumption of India-China talks on border issues. Another CTA minister said, ""India has to assess its long-term security situation while engaging in talks with Beijing. China cannot be trusted for what it says and actually does.""","Dalai Lama will turn 90 on July 6, a milestone which many consider to be the right time for the anointment of a new leader of the institution.

President-elect Donald Trump Saturday broke his silence over the ongoing H-1B row and said he has been a believer in this program.

But recently, he said if anyone graduated from US college, universities, they should get green cards automatically.The shift over the H-1B stance made the row crucial as Trump administration may bring about some changes regarding the H-1B visa program through which companies can hire foreign workers. And Elon Musk becoming a prominent decision maker, his stance on extending H-1B visa became a reason for concern to the America First activists.The H-1B issue became a major flashpoint forcing Elon Musk to declare war on Republicans who are criticizing H-1B. “The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla, and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B,"" Elon Musk said. “Take a big step back and F**K YOURSELF in the face.

The incident claimed the lives of at least 120 people, according to Yonhap news agency.In the footage documenting the crash, the plane is seen skidding uncontrollably along the runway before erupting into a massive fireball. Thick black smoke emerged from the engines during its attempted landing, only for the aircraft to be engulfed in flames moments later.The aircraft’s attempted ‘belly landing’—a last resort maneuver used when landing gear fails—is believed to have contributed to the crash. Initial reports suggest that the landing gear malfunctioned following suspected contact with birds.The incident occurred at 9:07 am local time, when the flight from Bangkok to Muan veered off the runway and collided with a fence at the airport, located approximately 288 kilometers southwest of Seoul. Onboard were 175 passengers and six crew members, most of them South Korean nationals, along with two Thai citizens.Jeju Air, founded in 2005, is one of South Korea’s leading low-cost carriers with a spotless safety track record. Its only other notable accident occurred in 2007 when a Bombardier Q400 veered off the runway due to strong winds at Busan-Gimhae Airport, resulting in a dozen injuries but no fatalities.The tragedy comes days after another aviation disaster in Kazakhstan, where an Azerbaijan Airlines flight burst into flames, claiming 38 lives.

What is known about the crash?

Azerbaijan's president Ilham Aliyev has alleged that the plane that crashed in Kazakhstan, claiming 38 lives, was shot down by Russia, albiet not ""intentionally"". He accused Moscow of attempting to ""hush up"" the cause of the crash which took place earlier this week, insisting Russia should admit its ""guilt"" in the disaster.""The facts are that the Azerbaijani civilian plane was damaged from the outside over Russian territory, near the city of Grozny, and almost lost control. We also know that electronic warfare systems put our plane out of control,"" Aliyev told state media, as quoted by news agency AFP.""We can say with complete clarity that the plane was shot down by Russia. (...) We are not saying that it was done intentionally, but it was done,"" he further added.Aliyev said that instead of apologising for the incident, Russia spent three days offering ""delirious versions"" of what had happened.""Admitting guilt, apologising in a timely manner to Azerbaijan, which is considered a friendly country, and informing the public about this –- all these were measures and steps that should have been taken,"" he said.“Unfortunately, for the first three days we heard nothing from Russia except delirious versions,” the Azerbaijani President added.Aliyev also outlined three demands to Russia in connection with the incident, stating that one of them has already been fulfilled.“First, the Russian side must apologize to Azerbaijan. Second, it must admit its guilt. Third, punish the guilty, bring them to criminal responsibility and pay compensation to the Azerbaijani state, the injured passengers and crew members.”The statement came on Sunday, a day after Russian president Vladimir Putin apologised to Aliyev for the incident but stopped short of taking responsibility.Aliyev previously informed Putin that the aircraft experienced ""external physical and technical interference"" while flying over Russian airspace. According to the Azerbaijani presidential office statement, ""President Ilham Aliyev emphasised that the Azerbaijan Airlines passenger plane encountered external interference in Russian airspace, leading to a complete loss of control.""Some Azerbaijani officials reportedly indicated that a Russian air defence missile might have caused the crash. In contrast, other accounts speculated about Ukrainian involvement or attributed the crash to an accident, such as a bird strike.The plane, an Embraer 190 operated by Azerbaijan Airlines, was en route from Baku, Azerbaijan, to Grozny, Russia, when it unexpectedly diverted toward Kazakhstan, hundreds of kilometres across the Caspian Sea from its intended destination.The aircraft crashed while attempting to land near Aktau, Kazakhstan, after flying east for hundreds of kilometres. The crash occurred about 3 kilometres from the coast, and cellphone footage appeared to show the plane descending sharply before hitting the ground and exploding in a fireball. Despite the tragic incident, 29 survivors were rescued and rushed to hospitals.Following the crash, Azerbaijan’s government initiated an investigation, with international experts now probing the event, although no further details have been provided. Azerbaijan’s Prosecutor General confirmed that investigators are working in Grozny. On Friday, both a US official and an Azerbaijani minister blamed the crash on an external weapon, with aviation experts pointing to Russian air defence systems possibly reacting to a Ukrainian attack.","Azerbaijan's president Ilham Aliyev has alleged that the plane that crashed in Kazakhstan, claiming 38 lives, was shot down by Russia.

Lee sustained a fractured left shoulder and head injuries but remained conscious.The second survivor, a 25-year-old flight attendant identified as Kwon, is receiving treatment at Mokpo Central Hospital. Kwon, too, has no recollection of the crash and reported severe pain in her head, ankle, and abdomen. Medical staff revealed that she suffered a scalp laceration, a fractured ankle, and is undergoing tests for abdominal injuries.“While her life is not in danger, the trauma and injuries are significant. We have yet to ask her about the crash,” a hospital representative said.Investigations suggest the crash occurred when the plane’s landing gear failed to deploy.

Dinner date inspired by a resemblance

A night of flirting and theories

The Instagram connection

Turning a resemblance into a social experiment

A promising future

In an oddly surreal turn of events, New York Post reporter Shane Galvin found himself on a date with a fashion model—thanks to a striking resemblance to Luigi Mangione , a suspect in the high-profile murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson . What began as a case of mistaken identity quickly morphed into a memorable evening filled with flirtation, lasagna, and lively conversation.""I’m on a date with a fashion model who’s way out of my league as a photographer snaps pictures of me trying to pour on the charm at an Italian spot—all because I look kinda like Luigi Mangione,"" Galvin humorously recounted in his New York Post column. The dinner took place at Inatteso, an intimate Italian restaurant nestled in Battery Park City, where he and his date enjoyed a bottle of white wine while discussing everything but politics.The model, who chose to remain anonymous, expressed her skepticism about Mangione’s alleged role in the murder, sharing, ""She’s not convinced Mangione is the man who killed Brian Thompson,"" Galvin noted. He reassured his readers, ""My date doesn’t think the widely circulated photo of the smiling suspect from a New York City hostel is actually Mangione—and allow me to assure you it isn’t me.""The evening flowed with easy conversation, lasagna, and playful banter. Galvin marveled at how smoothly the date went, despite his attempts to make her laugh with quirky jokes and theories, including one about the mysterious New Jersey drone phenomenon.""I realize the date is going criminally well when I rant for 10 minutes about 'The Telepathy Tapes' podcast and she pretends to find it interesting,"" Galvin quipped. As the night went on, he found himself reflecting on the bizarre series of events that had led him to this moment: ""Perhaps like Luigi behind bars, ‘How did I get here?’""It all started innocuously enough with a post on Instagram. After several people pointed out his resemblance to Mangione, Galvin couldn’t help but share his thoughts on the bizarre comparison. ""I do not look like the CEO killer other than being Italian. But thank you for telling me that, several people,"" he wrote on his story.What followed was a flood of flirtatious comments, including one from a striking model with over 20,000 followers. ""I mean… the eyebrows,"" she wrote, followed by an eyes emoji. Galvin, taken aback by the attention, admitted he didn’t exactly keep his cool, but it seemed to work.The model encouraged him further, saying, ""With the whole country thirsting for Luigi, y’all are about to have a blast.""The lighthearted banter soon evolved into a plan to turn their date into a social experiment for The Post. Galvin mentioned how the resemblance had become a topic of conversation, and the model eagerly volunteered to take part in the experiment. ""I volunteer to be part of the social experiment,"" she said, agreeing to let Galvin document the evening—though she declined to be named in the report.""It was an excellent date—even the photographer said so—and she’s a great gal,"" Galvin remarked. He described her as someone with a busy lifestyle, balancing modeling gigs with volunteering as a foster parent for homeless dogs. ""Clearly, way out of my league, and of all people, I have Mangione, I suppose, to thank for putting some stardust in her eyes.""The story concluded on a hopeful note, with Galvin revealing that there would be a second date. ""And we have a second date—no cameras for that one,"" he wrote, leaving readers wondering if this strange series of events would lead to something more.For now, Shane Galvin's unexpected dinner date with a fashion model stands as a reminder that sometimes, the most unusual experiences can lead to the most memorable moments. And perhaps, for better or worse, Luigi Mangione might have had more influence on Galvin's night than he ever expected.","New York Post reporter Shane Galvin went on a date with a fashion model because of a resemblance to Luigi Mangione.

Feeling reportedly guilty about the situation, Shukr turned to Hezbollah's senior religious cleric, Hashem Safieddine, seeking a solution to marry all four women.Safieddine, who was later killed in an airstrike after being named successor to the late leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, facilitated the marriages through separate phone ceremonies. Shukr had long been a priority target for Israel, particularly after the 1983 Beirut bombings that killed 241 US Marines and following a missile attack in Majdal Shams in July 2024, which resulted in the deaths of dozens of Israelis, including children.On July 30, Shukr was reportedly lured from his hiding place in Beirut’s Dahiyeh neighborhood through a phone call, instructing him to move from his second-floor office to his seventh-floor residence. Subsequently, an Israeli missile strike followed, killing him along with one of his wives, two children, and two other women.Lebanese officials identified one of the women as one of Shukr’s newlywed wives, while the identities of the other two women remain unknown.Hours after Shukr's assassination, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was reportedly killed in a separate Israeli airstrike while in Tehran. Soon after, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah met a similar fate.According to the New York Times report, despite warnings from his aides to relocate to a safer location, Nasrallah remained in an underground Hezbollah bunker, dismissing the possibility of an Israeli strike as unlikely to escalate into a full-scale war.Israeli intelligence had been monitoring his movements for years. On September 27, Israeli F-15 fighter jets launched a massive strike, dropping thousands of pounds of explosives that destroyed the bunker, killing Nasrallah and several high-ranking Hezbollah officials. The next day, Nasrallah’s body was reportedly discovered alongside that of a senior Iranian general stationed in Lebanon.The operation combined advanced covert surveillance technology with overwhelming military force, including the remote detonation of explosives hidden in communication devices used by Hezbollah and a sustained aerial campaign targeting thousands of missiles and rockets aimed at Israel.","Israeli intelligence learned of secret meetings between Shukr and four women with whom he was romantically involved and as well as his desperation about marrying them.

Prostate health and recovery



Past health challenges



Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu underwent successful prostate surgery on Sunday, hospital officials announced.Netanyahu, 75, has faced scrutiny over his health amid his leadership during the war in Gaza and a corruption trial.Dr Ofer Gofrit, head of the urology department at Jerusalem's Hadassah medical center , confirmed the operation went smoothly and stated there was “no fear” of cancer or malignancy. Netanyahu’s office reported that he was “fully alert” following the procedure and recovering in an underground facility fortified against potential missile attacks.Justice minister Yariv Levin temporarily assumed the role of acting prime minister during Netanyahu’s operation. The prime minister is expected to remain hospitalised for several days of observation.The surgery comes at a critical time, with international mediators pressing for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and escalating tensions involving Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels. Netanyahu’s health has become a focal point for Israelis and international observers alike, given the significant regional and global stakes.According to Netanyahu’s office, he was diagnosed last week with a urinary tract infection caused by a benign prostate enlargement, which had been treated with antibiotics. Despite successful initial treatment, doctors recommended the surgery to prevent further complications.Experts mentioned that complications from prostate enlargement are common in older men. Dr Shay Golan, head of oncology urology services at Israel’s Rabin Medical Center, explained that such procedures are often performed endoscopically, with minimal invasiveness and quick recovery times. Patients typically resume normal activities within days, though catheter use may be required briefly post-surgery.Netanyahu’s health has been under inspection in recent years. Last year, he was hospitalized for dehydration and later fitted with a pacemaker to address a previously undisclosed heart condition.Earlier this year, he underwent hernia surgery. These incidents have at times raised questions about his ability to maintain his rigorous schedule, with Netanyahu recently boasting of working 18-hour days.Despite these challenges, Netanyahu has cultivated a public image of vitality, frequently appearing in military settings in protective gear and meeting defense officials on the front lines.However, the revelation of his heart condition and other health issues has occasionally fueled political tensions in Israel, where protests against his government remain ongoing.","Netanyahu, 75, has faced scrutiny over his health amid his leadership during the war in Gaza and a corruption trial.

"Liam Payne Death: Friend, hotel workers, drug dealers charged with manslaughter and narcotics offenses, says report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/liam-paynes-death-friend-hotel-workers-drug-dealers-charged-with-manslaughter-and-narcotics-offenses-says-report/articleshow/116781146.cms,"The tragic death of Liam Payne, former One Direction star, has taken a dramatic legal turn.

The death of Liam Payne, 31, shocked fans worldwide and raised more questions than answers. Now, several individuals, including Payne’s close associates and hotel staff, have been charged in connection with the incident, which authorities initially suspected could have been a suicide. However, a thorough investigation into his death has ruled out that possibility, reported Daily Mail.Argentinian news outlet Infobae reported that a judge has officially charged five people. Two of these people have been remanded in custody, facing serious accusations ranging from negligent homicide to supplying narcotics. Among those charged is Liam’s friend Rogelio ‘Roger’ Nores, who had reportedly left the singer alone at the CasaSur Palermo hotel an hour before his fatal fall. Nores, who initially denied any suspicion, now faces charges of negligent homicide, adding a layer of complexity to the investigation.In a grim twist, Braian Paiz, a hotel waiter, has been charged with supplying narcotics to Payne in exchange for payment. Paiz, who admitted to using drugs, including cocaine, with the singer, denied having directly given him drugs but acknowledged his involvement in the situation. Similarly, Ezequiel Pereyra, a hotel employee, is also charged with drug-related offenses after allegedly delivering cocaine to Payne in a Dove soap box.Hotel management isn't escaping scrutiny either. Gilda Martín and Esteban Grassi, the hotel’s managers, have been charged with manslaughter after being implicated in the tragic event. Grassi, the chief receptionist, had made a 911 call moments before Payne's fall, claiming the singer had been acting aggressively and asking for alcohol and cocaine. Authorities also uncovered text messages where Payne reportedly offered an escort $5,000 to 'party' just days before his death.What makes this case even more chilling are the multiple reports that the singer had been battling substance abuse issues, which may have played a significant role in his demise. According to a psychiatrist’s email, Nores had been advised that continuing to support Payne, given his mental health struggles and the dangerous mix of antidepressants and alcohol, was no longer feasible. Despite this, Payne's circle, including Nores, continued to engage in behavior that likely contributed to his tragic end.Authorities have emphasized that Payne’s death was not a suicide. Tests revealed that he had alcohol, cocaine, and traces of an antidepressant in his system at the time of his fall. The singer’s state was described as ‘semi or total unconsciousness,’ which prosecutors believe explains why he fell from the balcony.The investigation continues, with hotel employees and alleged drug dealers facing a potential manslaughter charge as the case unfolds. Recently, a photo emerged showing three men, including Grassi, carrying Payne back up to his room shortly before his fatal fall. This image has fueled speculation that the charges could soon escalate to manslaughter.Witnesses to the tragic event, including tourist Bret Watson, have spoken out, describing the moment as something that will remain with them forever. Watson recounted, ""It's something that's been burned into my brain and something I'm never going to forget.""Meanwhile, Liam Payne's girlfriend, Kate Cassidy, who was with him just days before his death, is cooperating with police in their investigation. While not under investigation herself, Cassidy has expressed her desire for justice, saying, ""Anyone who provided drugs to Liam should be prosecuted.""","The death of Liam Payne, 31, shocked fans worldwide and raised more questions than answers.

Air Canada plane catches fire on landing hours after South Korea crash; airport shut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/air-canada-plane-catches-fire-on-landing-hours-after-south-korea-crash-airport-shut/articleshow/116760892.cms,"Just hours after the tragic plane crash in South Korea, a portion of an Air Canada plane caught fire after skidding down the runway at the Halifax airport. The airport was briefly shut down as a result, according to CBC News.Air Canada Flight 2259 , operated by PAL Airlines, had just arrived from St. John’s, Newfoundland, when a malfunction in the landing gear triggered a fire that spread across part of the aircraft.According to initial reports, the runway mishap began when one of the plane’s tires failed to deploy correctly. The resulting imbalance caused the aircraft’s wing to scrape along the tarmac, sparking a fire.Nikki Valentine, a passenger on board, told CBC News, “The plane started to sit at about a 20-degree angle to the left and, as that happened, we heard a pretty loud — what almost sounded like a crash sound — as the wing of the plane started to skid along the pavement, along with what I presume was the engine,” she said. “The plane shook quite a bit and we started seeing fire on the left side of the plane and smoke started coming in the windows.”Emergency response teams quickly mobilized to handle the situation. All passengers and crew were evacuated safely. There were no immediate reports of casualties.In a statement, airport authorities confirmed the emergency and assured the public that a thorough investigation was underway to determine the exact cause of the landing gear failure.This incident came hours after another aviation tragedy earlier in the day.

Cases of norovirus , a highly contagious stomach virus, are surging in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ), the week of December 5 saw 91 outbreaks, a significant rise from 69 in the previous week and far above the three-year average of 65 for early December.Norovirus, often called the ""winter vomiting bug,"" causes sudden bouts of vomiting and diarrhoea. Additional symptoms may include nausea, stomach pain, body aches, headaches, and fever.The virus spreads quickly, with as few as 10 viral particles capable of infecting someone, writes AP.According to CDC, it is the leading cause of foodborne illness in the US, responsible for 58% of such cases annually.Outbreaks are common in crowded environments such as cruise ships, nursing homes, schools, and prisons. It spreads primarily through direct contact with an infected person or by consuming contaminated food, water, or surfaces.Those infected typically develop symptoms within 12 to 48 hours and recover in one to three days, but the virus can cause severe dehydration, especially in young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems.According to AP, each year, norovirus leads to 19–21 million illnesses in the US, with approximately 109,000 hospitalisations and 900 deaths. Children and elderly individuals are particularly vulnerable, with dehydration being a major risk.There is no medication to treat norovirus.","Cases of norovirus, a highly contagious stomach virus, are surging in the United States.

Worst South Korean airline accident since 1997

A passenger plane carrying 181 people crashed while landing at Muan International Airport in southwestern South Korea on Sunday, killing all but two people onboard.The crash occurred when the plane, operated by Jeju Air, veered off the runway, when its front landing gear apparently failed to deploy, and exploded into flames.Video footage shared by the local broadcasters showed the Jeju Air plane, identified by Flight Radar as a Boeing 737-8AS, landing on the runway at Muan Airport. Smoke was seen coming from the engines before the aircraft was completely engulfed in flames.Initial reports suggest that the crash may have been caused by a bird strike, which is believed to have damaged the plane's landing gear, and adverse weather conditions, leading to the crash-landing attempt.""The cause of the accident is presumed to be a bird strike combined with adverse weather conditions. However, the exact cause will be announced following a joint investigation,"" Lee Jeong-hyun, chief of Muan fire station, said during a briefing.South Korea's transport ministry revealed that the control tower had sent a warning about a bird strike to the plane before the crash occurred.Airport authorities said that the flight was attempting an emergency landing due to a landing gear malfunction. The crash occurred after an earlier landing attempt had failed.Authorities further explained that the aircraft appeared unable to reduce its speed adequately, continuing down the runway until it collided with a wall at the airport's outer edge, where it erupted into flames.The crash is the deadliest aviation accident involving a South Korean airline since 1997, when a Korean Air jet crashed into a hill in Guam, a US territory in the western Pacific, killing 229 of the 254 people on board.This incident also marks the first fatal crash for Jeju Air, a low-cost South Korean airline founded in 2005 that operates flights to several Asian countries. The airline issued a brief statement apologizing for the accident.""We at Jeju Air will do everything in our power in response to this accident.

Former US President Jimmy Carter , the 39th president of the United States, passed away at the age of 100 today.

His death has drawn tributes from political leaders, including President Joe Biden , former President Barack Obama , and President-elect Donald Trump , who all reflected on his profound legacy.President-elect Donald Trump was one of the first to share his condolences following Carter's passing. On social media, Trump acknowledged the exclusive responsibility that comes with leading the country and offered his respect for Carter's commitment to improving the lives of Americans.""I just heard of the news about the passing of President Jimmy Carter. Those of us who have been fortunate to have served as President understand this is a very exclusive club, and only we can relate to the enormous responsibility of leading the Greatest Nation in History,"" Trump wrote.He added, “While I strongly disagreed with him philosophically and politically, I also realized that he truly loved and respected our Country, and all it stands for. He worked hard to make America a better place, and for that I give him my highest respect. He was a truly good man and, of course, will be greatly missed.""Trump extended his condolences to the Carter family and urged people to keep them in their hearts and prayers during this difficult time.President Joe Biden, who had known Carter for over six decades, remembered him as a dear friend. On social media, Biden shared a heartfelt tribute, recalling the decades of friendship he and his wife, Jill, shared with the former president.""Over six decades, Jill and I had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend. What's extraordinary about Jimmy Carter is that millions of people throughout America and the world, who never met him, thought of him as a dear friend as well,"" Biden wrote.The White House also released a statement from President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden honoring Carter’s life and contributions.""Today, America and the world lost an extraordinary leader, statesman, and humanitarian.""Biden and the First Lady stressed Carter’s relentless work in advancing civil rights, combating disease, promoting free and fair elections, and housing the homeless. They described Carter as a figure of ""great character, courage, hope, and optimism,"" whose humility and dedication to others changed lives across the globe.""With his compassion and moral clarity, he worked to eradicate disease, forge peace, advance civil rights and human rights, promote free and fair elections, house the homeless, and always advocate for the least among us. He saved, lifted, and changed the lives of people all across the globe,"" the statement said.Biden also reflected on the enduring bond between Carter and his wife Rosalynn, calling their partnership ""the definition of patriotism"" and a model of selfless leadership.""He was a man of great character and courage, hope and optimism. We will always cherish seeing him and Rosalynn together. The love shared between Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter is the definition of partnership and their humble leadership is the definition of patriotism,"" the statement added.To honor Carter's extraordinary life, Biden announced an official state funeral to be held in Washington D.C., recognizing him as a ""favorite son of Plains, Georgia,"" a ""man of principle, faith, and humility,"" and an exemplary public servant.""To honor a great American, I will be ordering an official state funeral to be held in Washington D.C. for James Earl Carter, Jr., 39th President of the United States, 76th Governor of Georgia, Lieutenant of the United States Navy, graduate of the United States Naval Academy, and favorite son of Plains, Georgia, who gave his full life in service to God and country.""Former President Barack Obama also paid tribute to Jimmy Carter, recounting moments from his presidency and post-presidency life. Obama fondly remembered visiting Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia, where Carter continued his tradition of teaching Sunday school well into his later years. Obama noted that the church was often filled with tourists who admired Carter for his historical achievements as well as his deep decency.""In some ways, President Carter's life was one of extraordinary public service, shaped by an unwavering commitment to the truth and to the greater good,"" Obama said in his tribute. “Elected in the shadow of Watergate, Jimmy Carter promised voters that he would always tell the truth. And he did.”Obama recounted Carter’s accomplishments, such as brokering the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel, his efforts to diversify the federal judiciary, and his environmental leadership. He also referenced Carter’s Nobel Peace Prize and global health initiatives, which further cemented his legacy as a champion for human rights and peace.""Some who came to hear him speak were undoubtedly there because of what President Carter accomplished in his four years in the White House,"" Obama said, adding that Carter's influence continued to resonate far beyond his presidency.Obama also mentioned that Carter would be laid to rest next to his wife, Rosalynn, in Plains, Georgia, where he had lived much of his life.""Maranatha Baptist Church will be a little quieter on Sundays, but President Carter will never be far away—buried alongside Rosalynn next to a willow tree down the road,"" Obama concluded.

Community demands answers

A family's grief

The mysterious death of Suchir Balaji , a former OpenAI researcher and whistleblower, has left his family demanding answers. Balaji, 26, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on November 26, with the medical examiner ruling it a suicide. However, his parents, Balagi Ramamurthy and Ramarao, vehemently dispute the findings, alleging foul play and demanding an FBI investigation .""I was the last person to talk to him,"" said Ramamurthy. ""He was happy, not depressed or anything. It was his birthday week. How can anyone believe there was no note left?""Balaji’s mother added, ""There were signs of a fight in the bathroom. Blood shots. This cannot be ignored.""The tragedy occurred three months after Balaji publicly accused OpenAI of copyright violations in the development of ChatGPT, a move his parents believe may have put him at risk.The San Francisco Police Department stated that no evidence of foul play was found during their initial investigation. A gun was discovered near Balaji’s body, and the absence of others at the scene contributed to the suicide ruling. Yet, his parents argue that the investigation was rushed.“It took the medical examiner 40 seconds to declare it a suicide,” Ramarao alleged, as reported by The Gaurdian.Balaji had no history of mental illness , and his parents insist he had plans to visit them in January. ""This is not the behavior of someone considering ending their life,"" said Ramamurthy.Balaji, a computer science prodigy from UC Berkeley, began his career at OpenAI in 2020, working on projects that laid the groundwork for ChatGPT. He quit in August, citing ethical concerns about copyright violations.“If you believe what I believe, you have to just leave the company,” he said in an October interview with The New York Times.OpenAI expressed its condolences, stating it was ""devastated"" by the news and offered support to Balaji’s family.At a candlelight vigil attended by 80 people, supporters called for a deeper investigation. Ganesh Balamitran, a Fremont resident, praised Balaji’s advocacy for creators’ rights. ""He was fighting for every creative artist out there,"" he said.Aruja Gupta, a San Jose State University student, echoed the demand for justice: ""The police need to put more resources into this case.""Balaji’s parents shared memories of their son’s brilliance and ethical upbringing. “He was a prodigy,” Ramarao said. “The ethics with which I raised him took his life today.”The case remains under active investigation, but for Balaji’s parents, only a federal probe can uncover the truth.

Jimmy Carter, the 39th President of the United States, passed away on Sunday at the age of 100 in Plains, Georgia, after a year of hospice care. He was the longest-living US president, leaving behind a legacy as a dedicated global humanitarian. Carter, along with his wife Rosalynn , who died last year in November at 96, spent most of their lives in the small town of Plains, The Carter Center told.James Earl Carter Jr was born on October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia. He grew up in the nearby town of Archery, where his family was part of a minority in a predominantly Black community. Carter’s early experiences were shaped by his Black caregivers and playmates. His father owned land and a grocery store while his mother, Lillian, would become a staple of his political campaigns.After attending the US Naval Academy, Carter graduated in 1946 and married Rosalynn Smith , a fellow Plains native, later that year. Their partnership became central to his political career.Carter was described as a businessman, Navy officer, evangelist, politician, negotiator, author, woodworker, and a true citizen of the world. His diverse contributions broke political boundaries, setting him apart from the 45 men who held the nation’s highest office.“My faith demands — this is not optional — my faith demands that I do whatever I can, wherever I am, whenever I can, for as long as I can, with whatever I have to try to make a difference,” he once said.Carter’s political career began in 1962 when he won a seat in the Georgia state Senate. Despite losing his first run for governor in 1966 to the segregationist Lester Maddox, Carter soon returned to politics and contested for governor again in 1970where he defeated Carl Sanders.As governor, Carter became known for his progressive stance on race relations, environmental issues, and government reform. He declared in his 1971 inaugural address that “I say to you quite frankly that the time for racial discrimination is over,” a bold stance that raised the bar for other Southern governors.“I thought when we got into politics we would have resolved everything,” Carter told news agency AP in 2021.In 1976, Carter entered the presidential race as an unknown figure, a Georgia governor with a straightforward, no-frills campaign, which relied on public financing. His promise to be truthful to the American people with a strong focus on honesty resonated after the Watergate scandal and the Vietnam War.Carter defeated incumbent President Gerald Ford, who had pardoned Nixon, with a promise not to deceive the public.Carter's presidency was marked by several significant achievements:One of his most acclaimed accomplishments was brokering the peace deal between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin in 1978, which earned him international recognition.Carter focused on human rights in foreign policy, pressuring dictatorships to release political prisoners and normalizing relations with China.He worked on energy conservation, deregulated key industries, and made significant environmental protections, including the establishment of national parks in Alaska.Carter signed SALT II, a new strategic arms treaty with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. However, following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, he retracted the agreement, imposed trade sanctions, and ordered a US boycott of the Moscow Olympics.He also appointed women and nonwhite people to significant federal positions.Despite these successes, Carter faced numerous challenges, including double-digit inflation, the Iranian hostage crisis, and an energy crisis. His presidency also struggled with high unemployment and gasoline shortages. The Iranian hostage crisis, which lasted 444 days, ultimately led to his defeat in 1980 to Ronald Reagan After his loss in 1980, Carter turned to humanitarian work and founded The Carter Center in 1982. His center became a hub for global peace efforts, democracy promotion, and public health initiatives.Despite political setbacks and his loss in 1980, Carter’s post-presidential years transformed his legacy. His work with The Carter Center earned him respect as a global statesman. He became known for his commitment to human rights, global health, and diplomacy.Carter was sometimes criticized for his approach to Washington politics, particularly for his lack of engagement with the media and political insiders. However, his post-presidential work showed that his approach to global diplomacy and human rights was successful.Carter’s legacy as a president and humanitarian continued to evolve, with biographers and historians reassessing his White House years. He is now regarded as one of the most underestimated figures in American history.At the age of 56, Carter returned to Georgia with, “no idea what I would do with the rest of my life.”Jonathan Alter, author of Carter's biography published in 2020, remarked that Carter's legacy should be honoured as ""an epic American life,"" which began in a modest home without electricity or indoor plumbing and spanned decades on the global stage across two centuries. He also added that Carter would probably also be one of the most misunderstood and underestimated figures in American history.","Jimmy Carter, the 39th President of the United States, passed away on Sunday at the age of 100 in Plains, Georgia.

Post-Presidency and legacy

Jimmy Carter , the 39th President of the United States, passed away on Monday at the age of 100. Known for his unwavering commitment to human rights, diplomacy, and public service, Carter’s death marks the end of a remarkable life dedicated to peace, integrity, and humanitarian efforts.From his rise as a Georgia governor to his presidency and post-presidential humanitarian work here is the political journey of Carter.Jimmy Carter was born on October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia, a rural town in the heart of the Deep South. Raised in a modest, Christian household, Carter’s early life was shaped by the values of hard work, personal integrity, and a deep respect for education. He attended the US Naval Academy at Annapolis, where he graduated in 1946. After serving in the US Navy, including time in the submarine service, Carter returned to Georgia, where he took over the family peanut farm. This move to the family farm helped him connect with his community and the people of Georgia, laying the groundwork for his political career.In 1962, Carter’s political journey took its first step when he entered the race for the Georgia State Senate. Though he was a political outsider with limited resources, Carter’s message of honesty and reform resonated with many Georgians who were tired of the entrenched political machines. He won his seat in the state senate and began his journey into the world of public service.Carter’s years in the Georgia Senate, from 1963 to 1967, were pivotal in his development as a politician. He advocated for reforms that focused on improving education, healthcare, and the environment. His time in the Senate also shaped his belief in the power of government to make a positive difference in people’s lives. However, his true political breakthrough came in 1970 when he was elected governor of Georgia.Jimmy Carter’s time as governor of Georgia, from 1971 to 1975, marked a period of profound transformation. Running on a platform of reform, he pushed for changes that would modernize the state and make government more efficient. He advocated for education reform, environmental protection, and civil rights. One of his most significant accomplishments was his push for desegregation in Georgia’s public schools, a stance that was both progressive and bold for a Southern politician of that era.Carter’s commitment to racial equality was evident throughout his time as governor. In 1971, he appointed the first African American to the Georgia State Board of Education. He also worked to expand voting rights for African Americans, a cause that was personal for him, given his Southern roots and the racial inequalities that had plagued the region for decades.While Carter’s progressive policies and stand on civil rights earned him praise, they also earned him enemies in Georgia’s political establishment. Many saw him as a threat to the traditional Southern political order. Nevertheless, Carter’s reputation as an honest and principled leader continued to grow, and by the time he left the governor’s mansion, he had positioned himself as a potential candidate for higher office.In 1976, Carter made the decision to run for the presidency. At the time, the country was in the midst of a crisis of confidence in its government. The Watergate scandal had rocked the nation, leading to the resignation of President Richard Nixon . The American people were disillusioned with the political establishment, and many were searching for a candidate they could trust—someone who represented integrity, honesty, and a new direction for the country. Carter, with his background as a political outsider and his reputation for honesty, seemed to fit the bill.Carter’s campaign was a study in humility and transparency. He ran as a Washington outsider, promising to restore trust in the government. His famous pledge to the American people was simple yet profound: “If I ever lie to you, if I ever make a misleading statement, don’t vote for me.” This promise resonated deeply with voters who were weary of the scandals and dishonesty that had plagued the Nixon administration.Despite being largely unknown on the national stage, Carter’s grassroots campaign gained momentum. He won the Democratic nomination after a hard-fought battle against more established candidates, including George Wallace and Hubert Humphrey. Carter’s appeal was based on his image as a man of integrity, his outsider status, and his commitment to restoring honesty to the White House. On November 2, 1976, Carter narrowly defeated incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford, securing 297 electoral votes to Ford’s 240, and became the 39th president of the United States.Jimmy Carter’s presidency was marked by a series of domestic and international challenges. Domestically, he faced an economy suffering from high inflation, rising energy costs, and unemployment. Internationally, the Cold War loomed large, and tensions with the Soviet Union, particularly over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, were high. Additionally, Carter had to contend with the ongoing energy crisis, the Iranian hostage crisis, and the complex politics of the Middle East.One of Carter’s most enduring accomplishments as president was his role in the Camp David Accords, which he brokered in 1978. The agreement brought together Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin , and it resulted in a peace agreement between the two nations. The success of the Camp David Accords earned Carter international acclaim and cemented his reputation as a peacemaker.Despite this achievement, Carter’s presidency was marked by significant challenges. The economy struggled with double-digit inflation, and Americans faced long lines at gas stations due to oil shortages. Perhaps the most defining event of Carter’s presidency was the Iranian hostage crisis, which began in November 1979 when 52 American diplomats and citizens were taken hostage by Iranian militants. The crisis lasted for 444 days and became a symbol of Carter’s inability to resolve international conflicts swiftly.In 1980, the failed rescue attempt of the hostages further damaged Carter’s image, and his approval ratings plummeted. The economic troubles, combined with the hostage crisis, led to Carter’s defeat in the 1980 presidential election to Ronald Reagan , who won in a landslide.Though Carter’s presidency was relatively short-lived, his post-presidential career has been nothing short of remarkable. After leaving the White House, Carter focused on humanitarian work through the Carter Center, which he founded in 1982. The center focused on global health, conflict resolution, and human rights, and Carter became a leading advocate for disease eradication, democracy promotion, and peace. He also worked tirelessly to monitor elections in emerging democracies and mediate conflicts around the world.In 2002, Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to promote peace and human rights worldwide. He became the oldest living president in US history and continued to speak out on issues such as climate change, inequality, and global conflict. His ability to bridge political divides and his tireless work for peace and justice earned him widespread respect both in the United States and around the world.Despite facing criticism during his presidency, Jimmy Carter’s legacy is one of service to humanity. His commitment to diplomacy, human rights, and public service stands as a model for future leaders, and his life’s work continues to inspire generations of Americans and people around the world.Jimmy Carter's political journey—from his humble beginnings in Plains, Georgia, to the White House and beyond—represents a lifelong dedication to making the world a better place. While his presidency may have been fraught with challenges, his post-presidential work has solidified his place as one of the most respected and beloved figures in American history.","Jimmy Carter was born on October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia, a rural town in the heart of the Deep South.

The boy, identified as Balach, son of Sabrullah, is from the Panjgur district, and his family members claimed that he was forcibly taken from his home ten days ago during a raid by Pakistani forces.According to The Balochistan Post, Balach was reportedly subjected to physical abuse before being taken away while still injured. Authorities have yet to comment on the incident, which has sparked concern among local and international human rights organisations.The Pakistani military's repeated targeting of the family has been documented, with previous incidents including a raid on their residence where property was damaged and two hand grenades were thrown outside, though no injuries were reported.According to local sources, the forces have conducted regular raids on the house, subjecting the family to continuous intimidation, as per the report.In another incident, Pakistani forces detained a man identified as Fazal Bashir in the coastal city of Gwadar. Fazal, a resident of Hirabad area in Kech district, was detained on December 23, and his location remains unidentified, according to The Balochistan Post.His family has sought assistance from human rights organisations to determine his whereabouts, worried about his safety. The persistent issue of enforced disappearances in Balochistan continues to draw attention, with local activists and human rights organisations demanding accountability and the release of missing persons.Despite continuous calls for justice, these incidents highlight the ongoing accusations against Pakistani security forces in the region.The families of Balach and Fazal have requested authorities to investigate their cases and provide information about their missing relatives.Balochistan continues to witness systematic abductions and killings, affecting various segments of society including activists, politicians, journalists and civilians, who are reportedly taken by security forces, according to news agency ANI.The Pakistani military faces frequent accusations of using enforced disappearances as a tactic against insurgents and separatist groups.

At least 10 people were killed and hundreds injured during the May 9 riots, while approximately 40 public buildings and military installations were damaged, including the Lahore corps commander’s House (Jinnah House) and Askari Tower in Lahore, the army’s general headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) office in Faisalabad, the Radio Pakistan building in Peshawar, a toll plaza on the Swat motorway, and a PAF base in Imran’s hometown of Mianwali.Imran and his party have called for a judicial probe into last year’s events, claiming that violence on May 9 was a “false flag” operation aimed at crushing PTI.

Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots that targeted military sites and other facilities following the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan This brings the total number of convictions related to the unrest to 85, according to announcements from the military’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).Among those sentenced is Hassan Niazi , Khan’s nephew, who received a 10-year prison term for his alleged role in the attack on the Lahore Corps Commander’s residence, also known as Jinnah House.The ISPR stated that the Field General Court Martial handed down the sentences after reviewing evidence and ensuring due process. “Sequel to the announcement of the May 9 punishments... the Field General Court Martial has promulgated the punishments to the following remaining 60 culprits after examining all evidence, ensuring the provision of all legal rights to the convicts, completion of due process, and the appropriate legal proceedings,” the ISPR announced.The convicted individuals face sentences ranging from two to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment. They have the right to appeal the decisions under Pakistan's Constitution.The unrest on May 9 erupted after Imran Khan’s arrest in a corruption case. Supporters of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party allegedly attacked key military installations, including the Army General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, the Corps Commander’s House in Lahore, and an ISI office in Faisalabad.In response, authorities detained hundreds of individuals, and 103 were handed over to military courts for trial, sparking widespread criticism of the opaque judicial process.The convictions have drawn sharp rebukes from international entities, including the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union. Critics argue that the use of military courts to try civilians undermines judicial independence and transparency.“These military courts lack judicial independence, transparency, and due process guarantees,” the US State Department said. Similarly, the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCO) criticized the lack of transparency and independent oversight in the trials, emphasizing the importance of adhering to fair trial standards under international law.The European Union also expressed concern, highlighting that Pakistan’s actions contradict its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and commitments tied to the GSP+ trade program.The Pakistani government has defended the use of military courts, citing the Supreme Court’s decision that allowed the military to proceed with trials of civilians involved in the riots.

Pakistan Airstrikes Afghanistan: Kabul claims Pak airstrikes killed 46 civilians in Afghanistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/kabul-claims-pak-airstrikes-killed-46-civilians-in-afghanistan/articleshow/116661701.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The interim Afghan Taliban govt claimed on Wednesday that 46 people, mostly women and children, were killed in airstrikes by Pakistani fighter jets on civilians in eastern Afghanistan late Tuesday night.Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province near Pakistan’s volatile South Waziristan tribal district, on alleged camps of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). This has been the fourth time in the past few years that Pakistan has conducted airstrikes inside Afghanistan, and the second time since March 2024.“Last night (Tuesday), Pakistan bombarded four points in Barmal district of Paktika province. The total number of dead is 46, most of whom were children and women,” said Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesperson for the Afghan Taliban govt. He added that six others, mostly children, were wounded.Condemning the airstrikes, the Afghan defence ministry called them “barbaric” and a clear “aggression”. It stated that several refugees, including women and children, were killed and injured. “The Pakistani side should understand that such arbitrary measures are not a solution to any problem,” Enayatullah Khowarazami, spokesperson for Afghanistan’s defence ministry, wrote on social media platform ‘X’. “The Islamic Emirate (Afghan Taliban regime) will not leave this cowardly act unanswered, but rather considers the defence of its territory and sovereignty to be its inalienable right,” he added.The strikes took place hours after Pakistan special representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq met interim Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul, intending to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long gap. The deteriorating ties, however, are likely to worsen following Tuesday night’s airstrikes, analysts said.Pakistan alleges the Afghan government harbours armed groups, particularly the TTP, which conducts cross-border assaults against Pakistani security forces. In one of the worst recent assaults on security forces, the TTP had claimed responsibility for the killing of at least 16 Pakistani soldiers in South Waziristan last week.Kabul, however, denies providing shelter to armed groups or allowing their territory to be used for cross-border attacks.Border tensions between the two countries have surged since the Taliban regime took control in 2021, with Pakistan experiencing a revival of militant activity along its western border. Deadly air attacks by Pakistan’s military in Afghan border regions in March, which the Taliban claimed killed eight civilians, had sparked confrontations along the the disputed border between the two countries.","Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province.

ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani minister on Wednesday defended the military trial of civilians, saying that such courts were competent to deal with the cases related to attacks on army facilities.Information minister Attaullah Tarar also urged the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) led by Imran Khan to refrain from politicising or disputing the issue of military trials.""When an attack is carried out on a defence institution or its property is set ablaze, it becomes the responsibility of the relevant authorities to apprehend the culprits.

Yet now, the same individuals are lobbying internationally against these courts,"" Tarar said.He assured that military trials adhere to fair trial principles and dismissed claims of injustice in military trials.The military courts tasked to hear cases of suspects involved in the attacks on military facilities on the May 9, 2023 protest last week sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from 2-10 years.Khan's party criticized the verdicts, arguing that military courts have no jurisdiction over civilians.",Information minister Attaullah Tarar says military courts are competent to deal with cases related to attacks on army facilities.

Tensions have grown since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021, with Pakistan accusing Kabul of harbouring militants responsible for attacks on Pakistani soil. Kabul has denied the allegations.The latest strike follows a recent raid claimed by the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) near the Afghan border, which Islamabad intelligence said killed 16 soldiers.On the same day as the air strikes, high-ranking Taliban officials were meeting with Pakistan's special envoy for Afghanistan in Kabul.

Pakistan has repeatedly accused the Afghan Taliban of providing shelter to TTP fighters, who have increased attacks on Pakistani forces in recent months. In response, the Afghan Taliban denies these allegations, asserting that civilians, not militants, were targeted in the latest strikes.“The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan considers this a brutal act against all international principles and blatant aggression and strongly condemns it,” said the Afghan ministry of defence. “The Islamic Emirate will not leave this cowardly act unanswered but rather considers the defense of its territory to be its inalienable right.”Islamabad contends that many TTP leaders and fighters have fled to Afghanistan, finding refuge in border provinces under Taliban protection. Afghan officials, however, have refuted these claims, stating that the victims of the bombings were primarily displaced civilians.The strikes came just after Mohammad Sadiq, Pakistan’s special representative for Afghanistan, visited Kabul for discussions on trade and bilateral relations.

The sanctions had frozen any US property owned by the targeted entities and barred US nationals from doing business with them.“Pakistan does not harbour any intention in which its nuclear system is aggressive, it is 100% in Pakistan’s defence. It is just intended for deterrence purposes and nothing else,” Sharif told cabinet members during a meeting.Noting that his foreign affairs ministry had given a “comprehensive response” to Washington on the matter, Sharif said, “This programme is not mine, nor any political party’s; it belongs to the 240 million people of this country, and it is dear to them. There will be no compromise on this programme, and the entire nation is united on this issue.”According to a US state department factsheet, the Islamabad-based NDC had sought to obtain components for Pakistan’s long-range ballistic-missile programme and missile-testing equipment. It stated the NDC “is responsible for the development of Pakistan’s ballistic missiles,” including the Shaheen family of missiles.The US sanctions were preceded by high-level military engagements between China and Pakistan. Last month, a top Chinese military official, General Zhang Youxia, visited Pakistan along with a high-ranking delegation. Youxia, who is vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), the overall command of the Chinese military headed by President Xi Jinping, had held one-on-one talks with Pakistan army chief Gen Asim Munir during his visit. Engagements between the two sides, according to the official handout, had focused on “matters of mutual interest, regional security dynamics, measures for regional stability, and enhancing bilateral defence cooperation”.","Washington had announced on Dec 12 that it was imposing more restrictions on Pakistan’s long-range ballistic-missile system.

Four former Pakistan international airlines (PIA) employees confessed to using fake degrees to secure employment or promotions within the organisation. Among them were two pilots, a stewardess, and a data entry operator. Their confessions came after an extensive Federal investigation agency (FIA) audit, conducted in 2022, revealed that 457 PIA employees had been recruited on fraudulent credentials.The accused, who initially denied the charges, later approached the court for pre-arrest bail, which was granted. However, during their indictment, they pleaded guilty and requested to record their confessional statements. Judge Tanveer Ahmad Sheikh ensured the accused understood the implications of their confessions, allowing them 30 minutes to reconsider before recording their statements.Nazia Naheed, a former stewardess from Karachi, admitted to using a fake BA degree to gain a promotion. Hired on a contract in 2001, she was terminated in 2014 when her forged credentials were discovered. Similarly, Mohsin Ali, a co-pilot since 2006, confessed to using a fake BA degree despite the job requiring only intermediate qualifications.Arif Tarar, who served 39 years with PIA, admitted to using a fake FA degree to move from peon to data entry operator. He retired in 2018 but was implicated in the FIA probe. Lastly, Kashan Aijaz Dodhy, a cadet pilot since 1995, confessed to submitting a fake BSc degree to show extra qualifications, leading to his termination in 2019.The court sentenced the four to imprisonment until the court’s rising and imposed fines.","Four former Pakistan international airlines (PIA) employees confessed to using fake degrees to secure employment or promotions.

Copying Cirus

MUMBAI: A little-known incident in the history of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme is a purported attempt made by the country in the early ’70s to copy the design of India’s Cirus reactor — a 40 MW thermal neutron research facility, which first achieved criticality at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Trombay, near Mumbai, on July 10, 1960. An acronym for Canada India Reactor Utility Services, Cirus was constructed with Canadian assistance at a shared cost of $14.14 million, according to news reports.Pakistan’s attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H. Khan , a man who played a role in the neighbouring country’s nuclear weapons programme. In his book “Eating Grass: The Making Of The Pakistani Bomb”, published in 2012 by the Stanford University Press, Feroz wrote, “Munir Ahmed Khan, later chairman of the PAEC [Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission], recalled that in October 1965 he had met Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto [the then Pakistan foreign minister] in Vienna. Munir explained to him that he had been to India’s Cirus facility at Trombay in 1964 and saw for himself that India was well on its way to making the [nuclear] bomb. Bhutto asked Munir to meet Ayub Khan in December during Ayub’s upcoming visits to the United Kingdom and the United States and try to convince the president of the urgency of a weapons programme.” The country eventually carried out its first nuclear weapons tests on May 28 and 30, 1998.Feroz’s disclosure, though now 12 years old, assumes immediate significance in the context of the US last week announcing fresh sanctions on Pakistan’smissile development programme. For the first time, the measures target Pakistan’s state-run National Development Complex, for its role in the country’s mission development programme. US deputy NSA Jon Finer has said, “Pakistan has developed increasingly sophisticated missile technology… If these trends continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States.”Feroz’s writing about the Cirus reactor is important because the plutonium for India’s Smiling Buddha project — the country’s first nuclear weapons test at Pokhran on May 18, 1974 — was from this reactor.According to Feroz, “Pakistani leadership wanted the rights to copy technological designs for its indigenous programme without incurring penalties and while remaining on the ‘good side’ of the international system.” He recalled: “While work to commission KANUPP [Karachi Nuclear Power Complex] went on, Munir Ahmed Khan said that there would be a secret team headed by a nuclear official, Sardar Ali Khan, to work on replicating India’s Cirus reactor.The author quotes Pervez Butt, who was purportedly part of the secret “copying’’ team and was chairman of PAEC between 2001 and 2005, as telling him, “Our team worked tirelessly, I did the mechanical part. When we merged our work and presented, Munir Khan could not believe it.”Feroz, however, has questioned Pakistan’s decision to copy the design of the Cirus reactor because there were some fundamental differences between Cirus and Kanupp.The team had modified the basic Cirus design.","Pakistan's attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H. Khan. Cirus was constructed with Canadian assistance at a shared cost of $14.14 million. Pakistan eventually carried out its first nuclear weapons tests on May 28 and 30, 1998.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116608587,imgsize-760319,width-400,resizemode-4/116608587.jpg"
