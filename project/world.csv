NCW takes suo motu cognizance of 'shocking' incident



NEW DELHI: A 26-year-old woman was allegedly raped inside a state transport bus early Tuesday morning when it was parked at Swargate bus stand in Pune, just a few meters away from the police station.The victim stated that while waiting for a Phaltan-bound bus at 5.45 am on Tuesday, a man approached her, addressing her as 'Didi', and directed her to another platform claiming her bus had arrived. He led her to an unoccupied 'Shiv Shahi' AC bus in the station premises, news agency PTI reported.Initially reluctant to enter the unlit bus, she was persuaded by the man who suggested she could verify using a torch. The woman reported to police that he followed her inside and committed the assault before escaping.The police have identified the suspect as Dattatraya Ramdas Gade (36) through CCTV footage. He has previous cases of theft and chain snatching, according to Swargate police station officials.The police said that they have deployed multiple teams to apprehend him.Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar called the incident ""extremely shameful, painful, and infuriating"" and said that there is only one punishment and that is death penalty.""I have personally instructed the Pune Police Commissioner to closely monitor the investigation and ensure immediate arrest of the accused. CM Devendra Fadnavis has also taken the incident seriously and has given the necessary instructions to the police. The police will arrest the accused at the earliest and the state government will take all necessary steps to ensure that the accused is given the harshest punishment,"" Ajit Pawar said.He gave assurance to all the people of Maharashtra and added that instructions have been given to the women and child development minister and the chairperson of the state women’s commission to provide justice, mental support, and all possible assistance to the victim.Deputy Commissioner of Police Smartana Patil confirmed that surveillance footage showed the woman walking with the accused towards the bus.DCP Smarthana Patil said, ""A working woman was waiting for the bus to go back to her home...A man came and said that the bus to your place has been parked somewhere else and took the woman near the parked bus...Then, the man raped the woman...A complaint has been registered...We have identified the accused, and we are making all the efforts to nab him. The accused is identified as Dattatray Ramdas Gade. The victim is stable right now...""The DCP noted that despite the presence of numerous people and buses, the victim initially continued her journey to Phaltan, discussing the incident with a friend over phone while travelling.Following her friend's counsel, she alighted within city limits and reported to the police station, Patil explained.Officials confirmed the victim was stable and provided a clear statement, leading to registration of a rape case under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.The DCP revealed Gade's previous cases in Shikrapur and Shirur police jurisdictions, with eight teams now pursuing his capture.A canine unit has been deployed in the investigation.This incident has sparked criticism from opposition leaders who criticised the home department, under chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, for inadequate handling of rising crime in Pune.The Shiv Sena (UBT) workers smashed window panes and damaged furniture in the security office, while women activists raised slogans against the BJP-led Maharashtra government, according to news agency PTI.“The incident that took place here, it happened in front of security cabin. If a woman is raped in front of security cabin, nobody has the right to sit there,” Vasant More justified the vandalism while talking to ANI.NCP (SP) representative and Baramati MP Supriya Sule criticised the BJP-led government over the incident.She highlighted the presence of nearby police posts and regular patrols in the area.""Still such an assault takes place at Swargate, which shows that anti-social elements do not have any fear of law. The home department has failed to curb crime in Pune. The trial of this case should be held in a fast-track court and the accused must get a severe punishment,"" Sule told reporters.Maharashtra Congress chief Harshwardhan Sapkal noted increasing rape incidents in the state. He emphasised that MSRTC buses are vital for Maharashtra's transport, yet now face such incidents.""When the Nirbhaya gangrape incident took place in Delhi, people changed the regime. You (BJP-led government) promote Laadki Bahin scheme for women (providing financial aid), but ignore basic issues of the people,"" he said.National Commission for Women (NCW) took suo motu cognizance of Pune bus rape case and sought urgent action.NCW strongly condemn the heinous crime and said that reports indicate that the accused is currently absconding, raising serious concerns about public safety and law enforcement measures.""In her letter, the NCW Chairperson has directed the police authorities to take the following immediate steps:1. Ensure a fair and time-bound investigation into the incident, leaving no room for delay or negligence.2. Extend all necessary support to the victim, including medical assistance, psychological counseling, and security to safeguard her well- being.3. Arrest the accused at the earliest and ensure strict legal proceedings under the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 to bring the perpetrator to justice,"" the letter read","A 26-year-old woman was allegedly raped inside a state transport bus early Tuesday morning when it was parked at Swargate bus stand in Pune, just a few meters away from the police station.

Lokayukta makes fresh request to Karnataka governor for HDK's prosecution in mining case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lokayukta-makes-fresh-request-to-karnataka-governor-for-hdks-prosecution-in-mining-case/articleshow/118587134.cms,"BENGALURU: The Karnataka Lokayukta SIT has submitted a renewed request to governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot seeking permission to prosecute Union minister HD Kumaraswamy in the 2007 Sandur illegal mining case . Kumaraswamy was Karnataka CM at the time.The submission, made on Feb 21, includes an English translation of all case documents and addresses Raj Bhavan's previous request for clarity regarding notes and case sheets which were in Kannada. ""The ball is now in the governor's court,"" a senior Lokayukta official said.The case revolves around allegations that Kumaraswamy illegally approved a 550-acre mining lease to Sri Sai Venkateshwara Minerals in Sandur taluk, Ballari district, enabling large-scale illegal mining. The 2011 Karnataka Lokayukta report by Justice N Santhosh Hegde first flagged these alleged violations. Kumaraswamy had been under threat of arrest but secured bail in 2015.The key allegation is that Kumaraswamy bypassed Minerals Concession Rules and ignored the chief secretary's advice while approving the mining lease. However, Kumaraswamy has maintained his innocence, stating he never signed the disputed file.The initial request for prosecution sanction was made to the governor on Nov 21, 2023. The governor, after seeking clarification on July 29, 2024, returned the file on Aug 29, 2024, instructing the Lokayukta to provide English translations of over 5,000 pages. With the translated documents now in place, SIT awaits Raj Bhavan's decision while exploring additional legal options.CM Siddaramaiah has raised concerns over delay in granting prosecution permission. He accused the governor of bias, stating that Raj Bhavan has been selective in approving sanction requests.Deputy CM DK Shivakumar took a swipe at the opposition, challenging BJP's opposition leader R Ashoka to comment on the renewed prosecution request . ""I'm waiting with bated breath to listen to Ashoka speak on the recent Supreme Court decision against Kumaraswamy and also the sanction for prosecution sought once more from the governor against the Union minister. Justice should be the same, as he has spoken a lot against me and CM Siddaramaiah when we were under the scanner,"" said Shivakumar.","Karnataka Lokayukta SIT has submitted a renewed request to governor Thaawar Chand Gehlot.

HC: False pledge to marry nixes consent for sex,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-false-pledge-to-marry-nixes-consent-for-sex/articleshow/118587128.cms,"NAGPUR: The Nagpur bench of Bombay HC last week upheld the rape conviction of a man for sexually assaulting a minor under pretext of marriage. The court ruled a false promise amounts to ""misconception of fact"" that invalidates a girl's consent, reports Vaibhav Ganjapure.Justice Urmila Joshi-Phalke rejected the accused's argument the girl had willingly engaged in sexual relations. A minor's consent is legally irrelevant, HC said. ""The accused misled her by promising marriage,"" she observed.Following the 16-year-old's complaint, FIR was lodged in May 2019. The girl said the accused sexually exploited her multiple times after promising to marry her. But when she conceived and approached him for marriage, the man refused. The accused was convicted by a special Pocso court and sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment.He had challenegd the decision. Challenging the decision, he said claimed the relationship was consensual. Justice Joshi-Phalke held the accused's intentions were dishonest from the outset. ""It is not merely a case of breach of promise, but of seduction as well. A false promise was made, and the survivor was subjected to sexual assault.Since the survivor was below 16 years, her consent is not relevant. She was under the misconception that he intended to marry her and, therefore, she submitted to sexual intercourse,"" the order said. The judge remarked that the DNA report corroborated the survivor's testimony, strengthening the prosecution's case.Justice Joshi-Phalke also underlined that the accused failed to present evidence demonstrating he genuinely intended to marry the survivor at any point. The court concluded the accused's conduct reflected a ""culpable mental state"" involving intention, motive, and knowledge, leaving no doubt about his guilt, and affirmed the sentence imposed by the Bhandara Pocso court.","Nagpur bench of Bombay HC upholds rape conviction of a man for sexually assaulting a minor under pretext of marriage.

Probe by CID into Badlapur encounter to continue: Judge

MUMBAI: In partial relief to five policemen indicted for the custodial death of an accused in the Badlapur school sexual assault case , a sessions court has ""kept in abeyance"" findings of a magisterial inquiry questioning legitimacy of the alleged encounter.Thane additional sessions judge D R Deshpande agreed that the magistrate's findings appear to be ""in excess of jurisdiction"" and that if they take effect it may render any revision application filed by indicted cops ""a futile exercise"". He asked the govt to keep the report, particularly paragraphs 81 and 82, in abeyance till the next hearing.Para 81 questioned whether use of force was justified and emphasized that the policemen were in a position where they could have better handled the situation, while para 82 said there were grounds of suspicion regarding their action if forensic reports were considered.The judge has directed that the probe by the crime investigation department (CID) into the custodial death should continue as it was being done independent of the report. The five indicted cops include a senior inspector, an assistant inspector, a head constable and two constables.Akshay Shinde, who was arrested in Aug 2024 for allegedly sexually assaulting two minor girls in the toilet of a school, was shot dead in a police van on Sept 23 while being taken from Taloja jail to Navi Mumbai for questioning. He was an attendant at the school.Police claimed he snatched a gun, opened fire, and was killed in retaliatory firing. The magistrate had raised doubts on the policemen’s claims of opening fire in selfdefence. His report said there was substance in the allegation by the dead man’s parents that it was a fake encounter.The indicted cops filed a revision application before sessions court, questioning the findings. They argued that the magistrate’s role was limited to determining cause of death and an inquiry transcending this purview to assess evidence and record findings was erroneous under Section 196 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita. They urged the court to quash and set aside the “unwarranted findings”, saying the magistrate “overstepped his jurisdiction” by indicting them.A lawyer for one of the cops sought that the effect and operation of the findings be stayed to prevent prejudice to him.Special public prosecutor Ajay Misar submitted that the CID was probing the matter independent of the report. Taking the sessions court through the magistrate’s report, he said the “sort of confusion created due to inconsistency occurring in scientific evidence vis-a-vis the indisputable facts” necessitate “assistance of further scientific tools and tests”.The court said it would keep the findings in abeyance till the next hearing, but the CID probe should continue. The order noted a policeman’s apprehension that the findings may impede his legal rights and said addressing the apprehension was “needful”. The court said the accused's family must also be given an opportunity to be heard or oppose the revision application. Findings which “appear” to be “in excess of jurisdiction” have to be kept in abeyance until the family is heard, the judge said.It then directed the policemen to implead the accused’s parents as respondents and issued notice to them. The court posted the matter for further hearing on March 5.","Akshay Shinde, who was arrested in Aug 2024 for allegedly sexually assaulting two minor girls in the toilet of a school, was shot dead in a police van on Sept 23 while being taken from Taloja jail to Navi Mumbai for questioning.

Elon Musk’s connection to Canada and his response

A petition demanding the revocation of Elon Musk 's Canadian citizenship has rapidly gained traction, with hundreds of thousands of Canadians signing in just a few days. The petition, launched on February 20, 2025, accuses Musk of acting against Canada’s national interests and allegedly influencing its elections. The controversy emerges against a backdrop of rising tensions between the US and Canada, particularly after former US President Donald Trump’s recent return to politics and his provocative statements regarding Canada’s sovereignty.Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, was born in South Africa and holds both Canadian and US citizenship. His Canadian citizenship, granted through his mother’s birth in Saskatchewan, has now come under public scrutiny. The petition, despite being largely symbolic and lacking direct legal consequences, reflects a broader public outcry against Musk’s political influence and recent statements regarding Canada. As signatures continue to mount, the movement has sparked a wider debate on national identity, foreign influence, and citizenship laws.The petition, which has amassed over 250,000 signatures within days, was started by a British Columbia-based author and is endorsed by Member of Parliament (MP) Charlie Angus from the New Democratic Party (NDP). The document claims that Musk has ""used his wealth and power to influence Canadian elections"" and has allegedly aligned himself with a foreign government that threatens Canadian sovereignty.This comes in the wake of Donald Trump’s return to political prominence, where he repeatedly suggested that Canada could become the 51st US state. The former president has also proposed economic tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, and other goods, further escalating tensions between the two nations.Musk, who has previously voiced support for Trump’s hardline immigration policies, has now become a target of public backlash in Canada. His response to the petition was a controversial post on X (formerly Twitter), stating,The post was later deleted, but it fueled further outrage among Canadian citizens.Under Canadian law, citizenship can only be revoked under specific circumstances, primarily if an individual:Since Musk acquired his Canadian citizenship through his mother’s birth in Saskatchewan, there is no known legal basis for revoking it under the current framework. Even if the petition reaches its goal, it remains a symbolic gesture with no immediate legal force.However, under Canada’s parliamentary petition system, any petition with at least 500 signatures and an MP’s sponsorship typically receives a government response. Given that the country may head into a spring election, it remains uncertain whether the petition will be formally addressed.The petition and Musk’s comments have surfaced at a time of increasing geopolitical strain between Canada and the US. Since Trump’s return to the political scene, he has:Beyond government disputes, public sentiment has also shifted, with:MP Charlie Angus, who sponsored the petition, has been an outspoken critic of Musk’s growing political and economic influence. However, Angus has also announced that he will not seek re-election, raising questions about the long-term impact of his endorsement.The BBC has reached out to Angus' office for an official statement, but no response has been issued so far.Elon Musk’s ties to Canada date back to his early years as a young immigrant. He moved to Canada from South Africa at the age of 18, working odd jobs before enrolling at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario. Eventually, he immigrated to the United States, where he later became a naturalized US citizen in 2002.In response to accusations of working illegally in the US on a student visa, Musk has denied any wrongdoing, stating that he did not violate immigration laws. However, his strong political ties with the US—and support for Trump’s policies—have made him a controversial figure in Canada.In a recent interview, Steve Bannon, a former Trump advisor, criticized Musk, calling him a “parasitic illegal immigrant”. Musk has dismissed these claims, but the public debate over his citizenship status continues to escalate.","Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, was born in South Africa and holds both Canadian and US citizenship.

Taylor Swift has been sacked from Instagram after being booed at the Super Bowl

Taylor Swift has been facing backlash from Instagram after being booed at the Super Bowl, according to SportsMillions. Conservative fans, including Alexis Winters of Queens, believe the drop in followers and booing signals Swift should focus on music and avoid politics.Travis Kelce, boyfriend of Taylor Swift, has gained over 12,370 followers on Instagram following his Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, according to SportsMillions, which used Social Blade to track their social media stats.Taylor Swift's Instagram following has plummeted to over 144,200 followings following the Super Bowl LIX controversy , according to SportsMillions data, causing speculation about the reasons behind the backlash.Taylor Swift's presence at the Super Bowl, where she supported her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, was met with mixed reactions. Some fans were excited to see her, while others expressed frustration, particularly those who disagree with her political stances. Some speculate it stems from her growing political influence.Alexis Winters, a member of the New York Young Republican Club, attributed the decrease in followers to a broader sentiment among certain conservative fans. ""We are tired of celebrities calling down to us from their ivory towers, giving their two cents on policies that will never impact them,"" Winters stated.She further added, ""Taylor Swift is simply the best example of this, and her loss of hundreds of thousands of Instagram followers represents the hundreds of thousands of Americans who chose their president over the woke Hollywood mob.""While Taylor Swift's Instagram followers declined, Kelce gained over 12,370 followers after the Super Bowl, according to Social Blade tracking. Some fans argue that Swift's criticism is unfair, especially when compared to Kelce's reception. ""I mostly think it's equally maddening and unsurprising how people seem more eager to celebrate the man dating a successful woman than the actual woman herself,"" said Sara Koger, 32, of Buckeye, Arizona.Jenna Piwowarczyk, a leader of the ""Swifties for Trump"" movement, expressed disappointment over Swift's treatment during the game. ""When Travis made an appearance on the Eras Tour, Swifties were excited to see him and cheered him on. When Taylor was shown on the Jumbotron, she was booed,"" Piwowarczyk noted. ""I understand the demographic of the Super Bowl attendees are not fans of Taylor Swift, but the generalized hatred towards her for simply supporting her boyfriend is uncalled for and gross.""Also read: Travis Kelce’s ex Kayla Nicole stuns in a viral Fenty ad, blending seduction and empowerment that could make Taylor Swift nervous Taylor Swift's influence remains strong, with her Eras Tour becoming the highest-grossing concert tour of all time.

NDA Dispute Leads to FIA Blocking Two Motorsport Bosses from Key Meeting



Two high-profile motorsport officials, Robert Reid, FIA's deputy president for sport, and David Richards, chairman of Motorsport UK , were prevented from attending the latest World Motor Sport Council meeting. The reason behind their exclusion stemmed from their refusal to sign newly enforced non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), which are part of stricter confidentiality protocols introduced by FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem . This move has sparked significant controversy within the motorsport community.The decision to implement stricter NDAs was reportedly motivated by concerns over media leaks, which Ben Sulayem believes have negatively impacted his leadership. An FIA spokesperson justified the NDAs, stating that they are “routine in all organisations” to safeguard confidential information, maintain regulatory integrity, and protect revenue streams essential for supporting member clubs. It was emphasized that these measures received “overwhelming support” from a majority of WMSC members. However, the refusal by Reid and Richards to sign the NDAs led to their exclusion from the meeting, causing tensions to escalate.Reports suggest that legal letters were exchanged following their expulsion, raising questions about the validity of the meeting. Despite these concerns, it was confirmed that the gathering complied with WMSC governance, although the absence of key figures like Reid and Richards continued to fuel debate. Notably, FIA regulations specify that council members “may attend” and “have the right to vote,” highlighting the discretionary nature of participation.Mohammed Ben Sulayem's tenure as FIA president has been marked by controversy. He has openly criticized the British media for what he perceives as biased coverage of his leadership. Additionally, he has been vocal about issues like driver behavior, emphasizing that how he manages the FIA is “none of their business.” Recently, he proposed the reintroduction of V10 engines in Formula 1, stirring further debate within the sport.The latest WMSC meeting also saw significant announcements, including a rule change for the Monaco Grand Prix, which will require two mandatory pitstops from the 2025 season onwards. Furthermore, the FIA outlined its ‘Vision 2030’ strategy, detailing goals for the next five years.Also Read: F1 Australian GP lifts ban, fans can enjoy post-race track walk at Albert Park again Ben Sulayem is expected to seek re-election at the end of 2025, with no known opponents as of now. However, the controversy surrounding the stricter NDA protocols and the exclusion of senior figures could influence the political landscape of the FIA, potentially impacting his bid for another term. As tensions continue, the motorsport world will closely watch how this governance dispute unfolds.","Robert Reid, FIA's deputy president for sport, and David Richards, chairman of Motorsport UK, were prevented from attending the latest World Motor Sport Council meeting.

'Bacha bazi' on rise in Afghanistan as boys forced to 'serve' as sex slaves,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bacha-bazi-on-rise-in-afghanistan-as-boys-forced-to-serve-as-sex-slaves/articleshow/118591105.cms,"Photo credit: Generative AI/Lexica

acha bazi

In Afghanistan, a disturbing practice known as ""b"" continues to plague society as young boys, often pre-pubescent, are forced to dance for affluent Afghan men who subsequently sexually abuse them.These children, sometimes sold by impoverished families, are made to wear make-up and perform at gatherings.The practice, dating back to the 13th century, has persisted despite various regime changes. While the Taliban initially banned it during their first rule in the 1990s, the practice flourished again after the 2001 US invasion.Following America's withdrawal in 2021, it has become endemic, particularly in Pashtun tribal areas where estimates suggest half the men participate.""I love my lord. I love to dance and act like a woman and play with my owner. Once I grow up, I will be an owner and I will have my own boys,"" Ahmad, then 17, told to news agency Reuters in 2007, demonstrating how victims are groomed to accept their exploitation.The consequences for victims are severe. Beyond psychological trauma, they suffer serious physical injuries including internal bleeding, broken limbs, and sometimes death. When they mature, these boys often become social outcasts, turning to drugs or becoming exploiters themselves.The practice persists despite homosexuality being punishable by death in Afghanistan.According to Daily Mail, in 2024, the EU Agency for Asylum claimed: ""Afghan security forces, in particular the Afghan Local Police, reportedly recruited boys specifically to use them for bacha bazi in every province of the country.’The contradiction exists because many Afghans consider it culturally acceptable, particularly in conservative religious groups. According to a 2009 Human Terrain Team study, some Pashtun social norms don't view bacha bazi as un-Islamic or homosexual.Western forces encountered this reality during their deployment. Lance Corporal Gregory Buckley Jr's father revealed his son's distressing experience: ""At night we can hear them screaming, but we're not allowed to do anything about it,"" the marine told his father, being instructed to ignore it as ""their culture.""The Taliban has exploited this situation, using child prostitutes to infiltrate military bases and attack Afghan forces working with Americans. In 2016, numerous soldiers and policemen were killed through such honeytrap operations.Despite Afghanistan introducing laws in 2018 to punish those involved in Bacha bazi, the practice continues unabated under current Taliban rule. The situation is exacerbated by strict gender segregation and women's rights restrictions under Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada's leadership.The international community's departure has left these vulnerable boys without protection, perpetuating a cycle of abuse that remains deeply embedded in certain aspects of Afghan society.This represents a tragic failure of international intervention, leaving countless children exposed to ongoing exploitation and abuse.","Bacha bazi is a practice in which pre-pubescent boys are forced to dance for affluent Afghan men who sexually abuse them.

"'Scrapped buses still occupy terminus, depot in chaos': Pune bus rape case exposes security lapses",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/scrapped-buses-still-occupy-terminus-depot-in-chaos-pune-bus-rape-case-exposes-security-lapses/articleshow/118590295.cms,"A sorry state of affairs

Some scrapped buses are still occupying space at the terminus. Commuters say the depot is all about chaos and there is a sense of insecurity among the visitors, particularly women, because of lack of vigilance.

Reacting to reports about scrapped buses on ST premises being a 'den for anti-social elements,' transport minister Pratap Sarnaik said that since these buses are neglected, they have become hubs for illegal activities. He added that scrapped buses in depots must be immediately disposed of.

In 2012, MSRTC had installed boombarriers at the entry-exit points of the terminus and deployed additional security guards after its driver, Santosh Mane, drove out a bus parked in the terminus on the city roads, leading to the death of nine people.

Open access to private vehicles, lack of monitoring at entry exit gates, unattended buses, presence of private bus agents.

Bikers often ride through the terminus to avoid waiting at the busy Jedhe chowk.

Autorickshaws block space at both entry-exit points.

MSRTC says Swargate depot has 20 operational CCTVs, but commuters feel there's little monitoring.

A 26-year-old health counsellor with a city hospital was allegedly raped by a criminal on police records in a Shivshahi bus parked overnight at MSRTC’s Swargate terminus around 5.30am on Tuesday. The terminus, one of Pune’s largest transport hubs, is located opposite the Swargate police station and sees a daily footfall of 60,000 passengers and 600 bus movements connecting Mumbai, Solapur, Ahilyanagar, Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara, Karnataka, and Goa.The woman, a Phaltan native residing in Aundh, educates patients on surgical procedures. She reported the crime at 9.30am and underwent medical examination before an FIR was filed in the evening. Deputy commissioner of police (Zone II) Smartana Patil stated that police identified the suspect, who has cases of theft and robbery in past. CCTV footage captured him leaving the bus with the survivor. Authorities suspect he was at the terminus for bag lifting.

Musk says DOGE is 'tech support'

Trump speaks about cabinet choices

Zelensky to visit White House

Trump comments on possible cabinet disagreements with Musk's DOGE

Federal workers and job cuts

Trump plans EU tariffs

US President Donald Trump held his first cabinet meeting at the White House on Wednesday. The meeting turned into a long question-and-answer session with reporters, lasting more than an hour.Trump sat with his cabinet and Elon Musk, who was wearing a ""tech support"" T-shirt. He spoke on various topics, including government spending, immigration, the economy, and the war in Ukraine.Here are some key takeaways from Donald Trump's first Cabinet meeting:Wearing a black ""Make America Great Again"" cap, Elon Musk was among the first advisers to speak at the cabinet meeting.His comments came shortly after an administration memo instructed federal departments and agencies to prepare for workforce reductions. The federal government has more than 2 million employees, many of whom are nonpartisan civil servants.Musk downplayed DOGE’s role in government, explaining that its main focus is updating government technology.On his first day back in office, Trump replaced the US Digital Service with DOGE, transferring its employees to the new department.“I actually just call myself humble tech support here because, as crazy as it sounds, that is almost a literal description of the work that the DOGE team is doing: helping to fix the government computer systems,” Musk said.When asked which government department or cabinet members were the most resistant to his policy changes, Trump said, ""So far, I'm happy with all of those choices.""He acknowledged that some groups are more cooperative than others. He specifically praised Elon Musk, who is not a cabinet member, and secretary of state Marco Rubio.Trump said his administration is working on reducing the size of the government. ""We want to have a balanced budget within a reasonably short period of time... meaning maybe by next year or maybe the year after,"" he said.Trump confirmed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will visit the White House on Friday.He said the US and Ukraine will sign a minerals deal, though details are unclear. He described it as a way for the US to ""get our money back"" from the aid given to Ukraine since Russia's invasion.""We're going to get a lot of money in the future, and I think that's appropriate, because we have taxpayers that shouldn't be footing the bill,"" Trump said. ""It's all been worked out.""Zelensky has called the deal preliminary and said he wants further agreements, including security guarantees.When asked about providing security guarantees, Trump said the US would not do so, arguing that Europe should take on that responsibility.Trump supported Elon Musk and the department of government efficiency (DOGE), which is responsible for cutting government spending and reducing the federal workforce.He dismissed speculation about any disagreements between Musk and other cabinet members. ""They have a lot of respect for Elon and that he's doing this, and some disagree a little bit,"" he said. ""But I will tell you for the most part I think everyone's not only happy, they're thrilled.""He invited cabinet members to speak up if they were unhappy, but no one did.Musk described DOGE as a way for government agencies to remove fraud. He admitted there had been mistakes, mentioning that Ebola prevention efforts were accidentally canceled before being restored. ""But when we make mistakes, we'll fix it very quickly,"" Musk said.Trump addressed an e-mail Musk sent to federal employees, asking them to list five things they had done in the past week or risk losing their jobs. Trump said the cabinet supports the move.He speculated, without evidence, that some of the approximately one million workers who did not respond ""don't exist.""""Maybe they're going to be gone,"" he said.Trump said efforts are underway to identify those who have not responded. ""We're being a little more surgical in situations where people are doing classified stuff,"" he added.He encouraged other cabinet members to carry out similar reviews in their agencies. He also suggested that the Environmental Protection Agency, led by Lee Zeldin, might see a 65 per cent reduction in its workforce.Trump announced plans to impose a 25 per cent tariff on goods from the European Union.""We'll be announcing it very soon,"" he said. ""It'll be 25 per cent generally speaking and that will be on cars and all other things.""He criticized the EU for limiting access to American cars and farm products. ""They've really taken advantage of us,"" he said.Trump was also asked about tariffs on Canada and Mexico. He had previously delayed implementing them for 30 days after discussions with both countries.""April 2, the tariffs go on,"" he said. ""Not all of them but a lot of them. And I think that's gonna be amazing.""","US President Donald Trump held his first cabinet meeting at the White House on Wednesday.

US Supreme Court temporarily blocks order for Trump administration to release billions in foreign aid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-temporarily-blocks-order-for-trump-administration-to-release-billions-in-foreign-aid/articleshow/118590897.cms,"Donald Trump, US Supreme Court

Sweeping cuts to foreign aid detailed





Lawsuits and congressional pushback



Supreme Court intervention and limited payments



The US Supreme Court on Wednesday temporarily halted a lower court’s order requiring the Trump administration to release billions of dollars in foreign aid by midnight. Chief Justice John Roberts stated that the order from US District Judge Amir H Ali will remain on hold while the high court reviews the case.Judge Ali had ruled in favour of nonprofit groups and businesses that challenged the administration’s freeze on foreign aid, ordering the government to lift the block. However, an appellate panel denied the administration’s request for intervention, prompting an appeal to the Supreme Court.The Trump administration had frozen the funds following an executive order from President Donald Trump, who cited concerns over “wasteful programs” that he claimed did not align with his foreign policy objectives.Earlier on Wednesday, the administration outlined plans to slash more than 90% of the US Agency for International Development’s ( USAID ) foreign aid contracts, reducing overall assistance by $60 billion. The move significantly curtails US development and humanitarian programs globally, marking one of the most aggressive reductions in federal spending.An internal memo obtained by The Associated Press and filings in federal court revealed the administration’s plans. The memo stated that the government was ""clearing significant waste stemming from decades of institutional drift"" and hinted at further changes in the delivery of foreign assistance through USAID and the State Department .President Trump, alongside ally Elon Musk, has led the charge to shrink government spending, particularly targeting USAID programs. Both have criticised the agency’s initiatives as promoting a “liberal agenda” and being financially inefficient.On January 20, Trump ordered a sweeping 90-day review of all foreign assistance programs, leading to an abrupt suspension of aid. The freeze disrupted thousands of US -funded projects, with the administration and Musk's Department of Government Efficiency enforcing staff reductions at USAID through forced leave and firings.In court filings, nonprofit contractors working with USAID described the administration’s rapid contract terminations as an attempt to sidestep compliance with the federal court order. One email from a USAID official, cited in the filings, read, “‘There are MANY more terminations coming, so please gear up!’”Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, condemned the administration’s actions, stating, “The administration is brazenly attempting to blow through Congress and the courts by announcing the completion of their sham ‘review’ of foreign aid and the immediate termination of thousands of aid programs all over the world.”According to the State Department, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has reviewed and approved the terminations. The administration’s cuts include 5,800 of USAID’s 6,200 multiyear contract awards, reducing funding by $54 billion, as well as the elimination of 4,100 of the State Department’s 9,100 grants, cutting an additional $4.4 billion.The State Department memo, first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, acknowledged that the foreign aid terminations were initiated in response to Judge Ali’s order, which set a deadline for lifting the funding freeze by the end of the day Wednesday.As the deadline approached, the Trump administration sought emergency intervention from the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, after repeated warnings from the federal judge, administration officials confirmed they had begun processing a small portion of overdue payments, amounting to just a few million dollars out of the billions owed to US and international organizations and businesses.The Supreme Court is expected to review the case further before issuing a final ruling.","US Supreme Court temporarily halted lower court's order to release billions of dollars in foreign aid by midnight.

'It’s pretty sick': Attorney General Pam Bondi confirms Epstein files to be released tomorrow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/its-pretty-sick-attorney-general-pam-bondi-confirms-epstein-files-to-be-released-tomorrow/articleshow/118590745.cms,"US Attorney General Pam Bondi

US Attorney General Pam Bondi has confirmed that documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein will be made public on Friday, marking a major development in the long-standing case.“It’s pretty sick…” Bondi said in an interview with Fox News host Jesse Watters. When asked when the public could expect access to the files, she responded, “Tomorrow… breaking news right now, you're gonna see some Epstein information being released by my office.”The announcement follows increasing pressure from lawmakers, including Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who has urged the FBI and Department of Justice to disclose Epstein’s flight logs and other records. In a letter addressed to FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Bondi, Blackburn emphasised the need for transparency.“The American people deserve to know exactly who was affiliated with this network. As you know, over the course of many years, Jeffrey Epstein built a heinous global sex trafficking network that caused irreparable harm to countless women,” Blackburn wrote, as per The Hill.She also called for the release of all video surveillance footage from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence and business records obtained by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) has also joined calls for disclosure, questioning Bondi on social media about delays in releasing the files. “On Feb 11 & Feb 19, House Oversight sent a letter to the DOJ asking for status on releasing the Epstein files as well as JFK etc. The DOJ has not responded,” she wrote on X.Luna added, ""AGPamBondi what is the status of the documents? These documents were ordered to be declassified.”Meanwhile, Bondi assured that the Trump administration is committed to ensuring accountability. Speaking to political commentator Benny Johnson, she stated, “Donald Trump doesn’t make empty promises. I think promises made, promises kept, and that’s why we’re all there to carry out his directive about making America safe and prosperous.”During her remarks, Bondi reiterated that there is “no legal basis” for those implicated in the Epstein case to keep their identities hidden unless they are minors, victims, or cooperating witnesses.“People in that report are still fighting to keep their names private, Sean. They have no legal basis to do so unless they're a child, a victim, or a cooperating defendant by some chance against some potential case against Ghislaine Maxwell ,” Bondi said in an interview with Fox News.Epstein, a financier with ties to high-profile individuals, was first arrested in Florida in 2005 for allegedly paying a 14-year-old girl for sex. He later pleaded guilty to a lesser charge in 2008, serving 13 months in jail under a work-release program. In 2019, federal prosecutors in New York charged him with sex trafficking, but he died by suicide in his jail cell before standing trial.His longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, was convicted in 2021 for recruiting underage girls for Epstein and sentenced to 20 years in prison.As calls for transparency grow, Bondi has stressed that the Trump administration will not allow figures like Epstein and others involved in such crimes to escape accountability.“I was briefed on that yesterday. I can’t talk about that publicly, but, you know, President Trump has given a very strong directive, and that's going to be followed,” Bondi said.The Department of Justice and FBI have yet to comment on the upcoming release.","US Attorney General Pam Bondi has confirmed that documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein will be made public on Friday.

US President Donald Trump has called for the return of billions of dollars’ worth of military equipment left behind in Afghanistan after the 2021 US withdrawal . He also pressed for the removal of military leaders involved in what he described as a disastrous exit.“We left billions, tens of billions of dollars’ worth of equipment behind. Brand new trucks,” Trump said during his first Cabinet meeting on Wednesday. “You see them display it every year, on their little roadways. That’s all top-of-the-line stuff. I think we should get a lot of that equipment back.”The Taliban seized most of the more than $7 billion worth of US military equipment left in Afghanistan, according to a 2022 department of defence report. While US troops removed or destroyed major assets during the drawdown, aircraft, ground vehicles, and other weapons were abandoned. The Pentagon has stated that much of the equipment would likely become inoperable without US maintenance.Trump’s remarks came as he responded to questions about whether he would fire military officials responsible for the withdrawal. While he said he would not dictate decisions to defence secretary Pete Hegseth , he was clear in his stance. “I’m not going to tell this man what to do, but I will say that if I had his place, I’d fire every single one of them, Pete,” he said.Hegseth confirmed that under his leadership, the department of defence is conducting a thorough review of the Afghanistan withdrawal and plans to hold individuals accountable. “We’re taking a very different view, obviously, than the previous administration,” Hegseth said, pointing to Trump’s nomination of retired Air Force lieutenant general John Dan “Razin” Caine as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “And there will be full accountability.”Trump expects the Pentagon’s review to lead to the removal of most generals involved in the withdrawal, which saw American citizens and US allies left behind, billions of dollars in military equipment abandoned, and 13 US service members killed in a suicide bombing at Abbey Gate outside Hamid Karzai International Airport.“I don’t see a big promotion in that group,” Trump said of the officials involved. “I think they’re going to be largely gone. That was a horrible display.”“The outcome in Afghanistan was the result of many decisions from many years of war,” Former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, retired army general Mark Milley testified. “Like any complex phenomena, there was no single causal factor that determined the outcome.”US Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East, was responsible for the withdrawal.Trump also called on the Taliban to return US military equipment, claiming that Afghanistan has become “one of the biggest sellers of military equipment in the world,” profiting from abandoned US weapons, armour, and machinery.“I think they should give our equipment back. And I told Pete to study that,” Trump said.",US President Donald Trump called for the return of billions of dollars’ worth of military equipment left behind in Afghanistan after the 2021 US withdrawal.

The US government is undergoing a major restructuring as President Donald Trump pushes federal agencies to devise plans for workforce reductions and program consolidations.On Wednesday, senior officials initiated the process with a directive that expands Trump’s ongoing efforts to scale back what he sees as an overextended government. Thousands of probationary employees have already been dismissed, and now, the administration is shifting its focus to career civil servants with employment protections.""We're cutting down the size of government. We have to,"" Trump stated during his first Cabinet meeting of his second term.""We're bloated. We're sloppy. We have a lot of people that aren’t doing their job,"" Trump said according to news agency AP.The Trump administration's move is expected to have nationwide consequences, as approximately 80 per cent of federal employees work outside of Washington, DC Essential services such as patent approvals, food safety inspections, and park maintenance may be disrupted depending on how the cuts are executed.Opposition to the initiative is anticipated. Labor unions, Democratic state leaders, and advocacy groups have already used legal challenges to slow Trump’s previous efforts. Even some Republican lawmakers have expressed concerns about how deep budget cuts could impact their constituencies.“Once you do this damage, it’s going to be incredibly hard to rebuild the capacity of these organizations,” said Don Moynihan, a public policy professor at the University of Michigan. “It’s not like you can turn the switch back on and everything is going to be the way it was before.”Federal agencies have also been instructed to submit their workforce reduction plans by March 13. These proposals will not only outline layoffs but also specify which positions will be permanently eliminated. While no fixed targets have been disclosed, Trump has suggested that the Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, could reduce its workforce by 65 per cent.By April 14, agencies must also present strategies for streamlining management, increasing efficiency, and potentially relocating offices to lower-cost regions outside Washington. The deadline for implementation is set for September 30.Administration officials justify the initiative as both a fiscal necessity and a strategic shift.“The federal government is costly, inefficient, and deeply in debt.

Federal workers storm senate in protest against Musk-led job cuts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/federal-workers-storm-senate-in-protest-against-musk-led-job-cuts/articleshow/118589966.cms,"AP photo

A group of federal workers marched through the US Senate, to protest massive job cuts ordered by billionaire Elon Musk on Wednesday.The demonstrators visited multiple Republican senators, urging them to take action against the workforce reductions, while security personnel followed closely, warning them not to obstruct the halls, reported news agency AFP.President Donald Trump’s second term has brought sweeping executive orders targeting federal agencies including USAID. Musk, who is spearheading the downsizing, has left many career civil servants uncertain about their futures. Unlike the large-scale protests of Trump’s first term, opposition this time has started with federal employees themselves.Some employees have resigned instead of accepting Musk’s drastic changes. This week, about a third of technology workers at Musk’s newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) quit, claiming the restructuring would harm national security. Before leaving, they created a website called “We are the builders” to highlight the damage caused by the cuts.Protesters have adopted the spoon as a symbol of resistance. This comes from a Musk-led initiative called “Fork in the road,” which gave federal workers a choice: leave with eight months’ pay or risk future dismissal. Employees flooded internal message boards with spoon emojis and added them to their work profiles as a silent act of defiance.Several lawsuits have been filed against Musk’s actions, with mixed outcomes. The largest federal employee union, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), has vowed to fight what it calls “unlawful terminations.”Musk, however, remains unfazed. He has used his social media platform, X, to mock federal workers and promote polls conducted by his own political group, America PAC, claiming that DOGE is widely supported.","Federal workers marched through the US Senate, to protest massive job cuts ordered by billionaire Elon Musk.

President Donald Trump administration is cutting more than 90% of foreign aid contracts issued by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and reducing $60 billion in overall assistance worldwide, according to an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press.The decision follows a 90-day review ordered by President Donald Trump to reassess funding provided by USAID and the State Department for international development and aid programmes. The cuts significantly shrink USAID’s operations, leaving only a handful of projects that advocates are now attempting to preserve through ongoing legal battles.The Washington Free Beacon first reported on the reductions, which were detailed in both the internal memo and court filings submitted on Wednesday. The administration’s move was influenced by a court order requiring officials to lift a monthlong block on foreign aid funding by the end of the day Wednesday.“In response, State and USAID moved rapidly,” the memo stated, adding that the agencies targeted “USAID and State Department foreign aid programs in vast numbers for contract terminations.”","President Donald Trump administration is cutting more than 90% of foreign aid contracts issued by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) The cuts significantly shrink USAID’s operations, leaving only a handful of projects that advocates are now attempting to preserve through ongoing legal battles.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118589528,imgsize-1146213,width-400,resizemode-4/118589528.jpg"

Clock running out for refugees in Islamabad, Rawalpindi



'We've worked with the Americans for years'



Kabul, Islamabad row amid rising crackdown



Forced to move after decades in Pakistan



UN says Pakistan has a tradition of protecting Afghans

A woman who we will call Fatima fled Afghanistan with her family in December 2021. She had worked for an American non-profit organization in Kabul ­until the US pullout in the summer of 2021, when the Taliban retook control of the country.She is now based in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. And she is in trouble. Her Pakistani visa is days away from expiring, and the authorities are still processing her renewal application.""I am concerned about the renewal of my visa, and if not renewed timely authorities would arrest me and my family for illegally residing in the country,"" Fatima told DW.Police, including female officers, recently conducted a raid on a building where Fatima lives, looking for undocumented Afghan refugees. She was not in the building at the time, but her brother ended up in custody.""Later, we showed them our visa renewal application receipts and proof but police did not cooperate,"" said Fatima, who is now hiding from the authorities.In 2023, Pakistan started a massive initiative to repatriate approximately 4 million Afghans who have entered the country over the past 40 years. And while the authorities granted some leeway last year, Pakistan's government has now set a March 31 deadline to expel foreign nationals residing in the country illegally, with search operations ongoing in January and February.Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi ""have been verbally asked to leave Pakistan till 28th February,"" Umer Gillani, a legal expert and rights activist, told DW.Moniza Kakar, a lawyer working for refugees advocacy in Pakistan, said there was ""uncertainty and fear"" among the Afghani nationals in the area.""Since the start of this year, over 1,000 Afghans have been detained in Islamabad, and more than 18,000 have been forced to leave Islamabad and Rawalpindi because of government orders,"" she said.Amin, 28, is from Kabul. He spent years collaborating with the United States in the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan, before he too had to flee across the Pakistani border.Hee said he was just days away from being evacuated to America, but this was put on hold last month with President Donald Trump signing an executive order to suspend a refugee resettlement program.Nearly 20,000 Afghans are presently waiting in Pakistan for approval to resettle in the US through an American government program.""We've worked with the Americans for years, we helped and supported them in Afghanistan, we have given them a part of our lives and they have to support us so that we can live peacefully,"" Amin told DW.Over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with neighboring Afghanistan has deteriorated. Islamabad holds the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan responsible for their inability to control the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions with the Taliban regime escalate, concerns were also raised about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan amid reports of purported intimidation and arrests. The UN special rapporteur has expressed his worries, stating that Afghans in the area deserve more humane treatment.Activist Gilani said millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan are being used as ""hostages to build pressure whenever there is tension between the two countries.""Last week, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry dismissed claims made by the Afghan representation regarding the mistreatment of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, labeling these allegations as ""misplaced"" and urging Kabul to facilitate the smooth repatriation of Afghan citizens.Pakistan has accommodated hundreds of thousands of refugees from its northern neighbor, a situation resulting from decades of regional instability. Afghans who arrived in Pakistan following the Taliban takeover in August 2021 have been relying on visa renewals to stay in the country, a procedure that is costly, uncertain and often subject to significant delays.""The stories of refugees are devastating. Families who have lived in Pakistan for years, even decades, are now being uprooted due to tensions between the two countries. Children, women, and men who have already suffered so much are being treated as if they don't matter. This is not just a refugee crisis, it's a humanitarian crisis,"" said Kakar.UNHCR's top representative in Pakistan, Philippa Candler, told DW that Pakistan already repatriated over 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year.""As of December 2024, Pakistan hosted over 2.8 million Afghans with 69% of refugees living outside refugee villages,"" she said.Candler acknowledged Pakistan's generosity in hosting Afghan refugees for decades, and the current ""economic and security challenges"" in Pakistan that drive the repatriation efforts.At the same time, UNHCR was urging the Islamabad government to ""see the situation of Afghans through a humanitarian perspective"" and ""continue its long-standing tradition of protecting vulnerable Afghans […] regardless of their status.""""It's essential that we work hand-in-hand with both host countries and countries of origin to develop mechanisms that empower refugees to rebuild their lives in safety and dignity, including voluntary repatriation,"" she said.""We are calling for dialogue between the two countries, and for the refugee issue to be separated from political matters.""","Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi are in trouble.

New York City is terminating a $220m deal with the Pakistan-owned Roosevelt Hotel to house a migrant shelter following a prolonged MAGA meltdown over use of American taxpayer money to facilitate immigration to the US.Under pressure from the federal government and MAGA hardliners, Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who gravitated to the Trump orbit after facing corruption charges from the Biden administration, announced closure of the site that is said to have housed tens of thousands of migrants in its 1025 rooms at $ 200 a night.The site opened in May 2023 to serve as both a new arrivals center and shelter for asylum seekers under a three-year $ 220 million deal with government-run Pakistan International Airlines, which owns the hotel, having bought out a Saudi stake in it for $ 36.4million in 2005.At peak traffic in 2023 when around 4000 migrants were arriving in the city each week, the sight of asylum seekers camping outside the hotel waiting to be processed triggered MAGA hardliners and even some New Yorkers, as Trump and his supporters complained about Democrats housing ""illegal immigrants"" in ""luxury hotels"" at the expense of US taxpayers.""A taxpayer-funded hotel for illegal migrants is owned by the Pakistani government, which means NYC taxpayers are effectively paying a foreign government to house illegals in our own country.

With no passengers and no planes, Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport is a bit of a mystery. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million, it's anyone's guess when New Gwadar International Airport will open for business. Located in the coastal city of Gwadar and completed in Oct 2024, its a stark contrast to the impoverished, restive southwestern Balochistan province around it.For the past decade, China has poured money into Balochistan and Gwadar as part of a multibillion dollar project that connects its western Xinjiang province with Arabian Sea, called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC.Authorities have hailed it as transformational but there's scant evidence of change in Gwadar. The city isn't connected to the national grid - electricity comes from Iran or solar panels - and there isn't enough clean water. An airport with a 400,000 passenger capacity isn't a priority for the city's 90,000 people.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" said Azeem Khalid, an international relations expert who specialises in Pakistan-China ties. ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""CPEC has catalysed a decadeslong insurgency in resource-rich and strategically located Balochistan. Separatists, aggrieved by what they say is state exploitation at the expense of locals, are fighting for independence - targeting Pakistani troops and Chinese workers in the province and elsewhere. Members of Pakistan's ethnic Baloch minority say they face discrimination by govt and are denied opportunities available elsewhere in the country, charges govt denies.Pakistan, keen to protect China's investments, has stepped up its military footprint in Gwadar to combat dissent. The city is a jumble of checkpoints, barbed wire, troops, barricades, and watchtowers. Roads close at any given time, several days a week, to permit the safe passage of Chinese workers and Pakistani VIPs.Intelligence officers monitor journalists visiting Gwadar. Its fish market is deemed too sensitive for coverage.Many locals are frazzled. ""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" said Khuda Bakhsh Hashim, 76. ""We used to enjoy all-night picnics in the mountains or rural areas. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Hashim recalled when Gwadar was part of Oman, not Pakistan, and was a stop for passenger ships heading to Mumbai. People didn't go hungry and found work easily, he said.But Gwadar's water has dried up because of drought and unchecked exploitation. So has the work. Govt says CPEC has created some 2,000 local jobs but it's not clear whom they mean by ""local"" - Baloch residents or Pakistanis from elsewhere in the country. Authorities did not elaborate.There is a perception Gwadar is dangerous or difficult to visit - only one commercial route operates out of its domestic airport, three times a week to Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. There are no direct flights to Balochistan's provincial capital of Quetta, or national capital of Islamabad.Security concerns delayed the inauguration of the international airport. There were fears the area's mountains - and their proximity to the airport - could be the ideal launchpad for an attack. Instead, PM Shehbaz Sharif and his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang hosted a virtual ceremony. The inaugural flight was off limits to media and public.","Gwadar is Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million.

ISLAMABAD: A mob enraged by a local’s murder over a trivial parking dispute snatched the suspect, a watchman, from police and lynched him in the mountainous Galiyat region of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Sunday. Several police officers were wounded in the violence in a neighbourhood under the jurisdiction of Changla Gali police station, around 80km from Islamabad.Police said Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home. When he returned the next day, he got into a fight with the watchman, Khan Zaman, who allegedly stabbed him to death and wounded his brother.As word spread about the murder, a mob milled in the area and burned down five houses in the residential society.Police apprehended the culprit, who was hiding in the basement of a building, and were about to take him away when the mob swooped on him and beat him to death with sticks and stones.Lynchings are common in Pakistan and several instances of mob violence have taken place in the past decade. Many people have been lynched for alleged blasphemy, while mobs have also murdered suspects in street crimes.In June 2024, a suspected robber was lynched by a mob in the southern port city of Karachi. The suspect, armed with a pistol, had attempted to rob a citizen, who put up resistance and was joined by others standing nearby. The mob got hold of the suspect and hit him with blunt weapons, resulting in his death on the spot.In May 2024, another mob lynched a suspected robber in Karachi's Orangi town while police saved his accomplice from being killed.The same month, police rescued a Christian man from angry people, who wanted to lynch him and attacked the homes of other minority members in Punjab’s Sargodha district on charges of alleged blasphemy. Workers at a Sialkot garment factory tortured and burned to death their Sri Lankan general manager in 2023 for alleged blasphemy.","Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home.

Airport inauguration delayed due to security concerns



Pakistan’s newest airport in Gwadar, fully funded by China at a cost of $240 million, remains unused months after its completion in October 2024.Spread over 4,300 acres of land. the airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year. Work started on Gwadar airport in 2019.The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) PK 503 aircraft was the first commercial flight to arrive at the new airport after its inauguration carrying commercial passengers and high-ranking officials.However, the airport, designed to handle 400,000 passengers annually, has no scheduled flights.The New Gwadar International Airport is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), a multi-billion dollar project aimed at linking China’s Xinjiang province with the Arabian Sea. While officials have called it a major development, many in Gwadar say they see little benefit.Gwadar, located in Pakistan's Balochistan province , lacks basic infrastructure such as a stable electricity supply and clean water.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" Azeem Khalid, an expert in Pakistan-China relations was quoted as saying by the news agency Associated Press (AP). ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""The airport’s construction comes amid ongoing security challenges in Balochistan. Separatist groups in the province oppose what they call exploitation of local resources, targeting both Pakistani security forces and Chinese workers.Pakistan has increased its military presence in Gwadar to protect Chinese investments, leading to more checkpoints and restrictions on movement. Roads are often closed to ensure the safety of Chinese workers and high-ranking officials.""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" 76-year-old Gwadar resident Khuda Bakhsh Hashim was quoted as saying by the AP. ""We are asked to prove our identity, who we are, where we have come from. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Authorities claim CPEC has created 2,000 jobs, but there is no clarity on whether these positions were given to local Baloch residents or people from other parts of Pakistan.Gwadar remains largely disconnected, with only one commercial flight route operating three times a week to Karachi. There are no direct flights to Quetta, the provincial capital, or Islamabad.Militancy in Balochistan has increased in recent years, with attacks rising after 2021. Groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army have carried out multiple attacks, particularly after the Pakistani Taliban ended a ceasefire in 2022.Earlier, the airport’s opening was postponed due to security risks. Authorities feared that nearby mountains could be used to launch attacks. Instead, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chinese Premier Li Qiang held a virtual inauguration. The first flight landed without media or public presence.Abdul Ghafoor Hoth, a local leader from the Balochistan Awami Party, said no local residents were hired to work at the airport.""Not a single resident of Gwadar was hired to work at the airport, not even as a watchman,"" he was quoted by AP.Hoth had led protests in December demanding better living conditions in Gwadar. The demonstrations lasted 47 days before authorities promised to address local concerns, including improved access to water and electricity. Since then, no progress has been made on these commitments.","Gwadar airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year.

Two police personnel and four militants were killed in an attack on a police check post in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province on Friday.The attack came two days after the separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed the killing of seven passengers, who hailed from Pakistan’s Punjab province, on a highway in the restive province.In the latest incident, police said that armed men stormed a police check post in Shaban area, some 35 km from the provincial capital Quetta, early on Friday morning, “killing two policemen and injuring two others”, local police station in-charge Munir Khan said.“The police force retaliated and killed four attackers,” Khan said, adding, “Search and clearance operations continued in the area as some terrorists fled to the nearby mountains.”Pakistan has been struggling to quell separatist attacks in Balochistan, which shares a porous border with Iran and Afghanistan.According to official figures, around 40 attacks against police in Balochistan in 2024 killed at least 25 police officers and injured 61 others. Last month, dozens of fighters of the separatist outfit wrested control of a small town in Khuzdar from paramilitary forces. Pakistani authorities regained the town after hours of effort.The separatists accuse Pakistan’s federal govt and military authorities of exploiting the natural resources of mineral-rich Balochistan for development elsewhere in the country, while neglecting the local population. The province has been the site of an insurgency for the last two decades, with separatists frequently attacking police, security forces, and civilians they see as “outsiders” in the region. The BLA also targets Chinese interests in the restive province.",Two police personnel and four militants were killed in an attack on a police check post in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province on Friday.

At least seven passengers belonging to Pakistan’s Punjab province were shot dead late on Tuesday night in Barkhan district, in volatile southwestern Balochistan province.The incident occurred on a Balochistan-Punjab highway running through the Koh-e-Sulaiman mountain range. With 45 passengers on board, the bus was en route to Faisalabad from Quetta, Balochistan’s capital.A senior government official said the attackers burst the tyres of the bus on a highway close to the provincial border with Punjab. “Armed men stopped a Punjab-bound bus, with 45 people on board, on the Balochistan-Punjab highway and off-boarded seven Punjabi passengers after checking identification cards of those on board the bus,” Khadim Hussain, Barkhan’s assistant commissioner, said. “The commuters were lined up and shot dead,” Hussain said, adding the attack was carried out within 10 minutes and the attackers escaped into the Koh-e-Sulaiman mountains.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but ethnic Baloch separatists, who have carried out similar attacks in the past, are the most likely suspects. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) is the most active organisation in the region and it usually targets security forces as well as Pakistanis from other provinces.At least 10 mine workers from northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province were killed in a roadside blast in Balochistan’s Harnai district. Last year, at least 39 people were killed after BLA militants forcibly removed ethnic Punjabi commuters from buses in the volatile province. The BLA also targets Chinese interests in the restive province, claiming that outsiders are exploiting resource-rich Balochistan while leaving the natives behind.","The incident occurred on a Balochistan-Punjab highway running through the Koh-e- Sulaiman mountain range.

A resident, frustrated with the deteriorating road condition near his Cambridgeshire village of Castle Camps and took the matter into his own hands.James Coxall has creatively highlighted a large pothole by placing artificial legs in the water-filled crater, BBC reported. He placed fake legs on Haverhill Road in the Cambridgeshire village of Castle Camps to make it look like someone is taking a deep dive into a large water-filled pothole.Coxall explained that the road damage had persisted for eight months. Despite low traffic, drivers faced a difficult choice when encountering oncoming vehicles: either stop or drive through the pothole.The local authority responded, stating that their highways department would assess the situation and undertake necessary repairs.Coxall, 41, who works as a carpenter, explained that his family decided to address the long-standing issue with humour.""The shoes were going to charity anyway, so we thought we'd give them an outing first,"" said Mr Coxall.The family crafted the display using discarded clothing and timber. They filled jeans with old fabric, used wood for stability, and secured the installation with a brick in the water-filled hole, positioning the feet above the surface.After sharing photographs on local social media groups, including odd things around Cambridge, Coxall received numerous positive responses.""It's just a bit of fun, and I've had lots of messages about it,"" he said, adding that locals appreciate his humorous approach, noting his reputation as someone who enjoys practical jokes.","James Coxall has creatively highlighted a large pothole by placing artificial legs in the water-filled crater.
