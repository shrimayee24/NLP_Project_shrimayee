Magh Mela row: Seer ups the ante; asks CM Yogi to prove he is 'Hindu sympathiser',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/swami-avimukteshwaranand-saraswati-magh-mela-row-seer-ups-the-ante-asks-cm-yogi-to-prove-he-is-hindu-sympathiser/articleshow/127802581.cms,"Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati and UP CM Yogi Adityanath (Images/Agencies)

Maha Kumbh Stampede Compensation, Sambhal Violence Bail, Magh Mela Footfall And More

NEW DELHI: Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati on Friday asked Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath to stop beef exports from the state and declare the cow as ‘Rajya Mata’. He stated that such steps would prove the chief minister’s commitment as a “Hindu sympathiser”.The remarks come amid an ongoing controversy after the seer was allegedly prevented from taking a holy dip at the Sangam during the Magh Mela in Prayagraj earlier this month.Speaking to reporters in Varanasi, Swami Avimukteshwaranand said that he had staged a sit-in protest for 11 days after the incident but left the Magh Mela ground last Wednesday “with a heavy heart”.“When I sat there for 11 days, no official asked me to take a dip. Now it is too late. I will go to the Magh Mela next year and take a respectful bath,” he said.Challenging the UP government, the seer said that stopping cow slaughter and beef exports should be the first step in demonstrating commitment to Hindu values.“Our credentials were asked for, and we submitted them. Now you have to give proof of being a Hindu sympathiser. The first step of being a Hindu is love for cows. Declare the cow as ‘Rashtra Mata’ and stop the export of cow meat from Uttar Pradesh,” he said.The controversy dates back to January 18, when Swami Avimukteshwaranand was travelling in a palanquin to the Sangam on the occasion of Mauni Amavasya.A dispute broke out after police and administrative officials asked him to dismount and proceed on foot, citing heavy crowds. The Mela administration later alleged that his supporters broke a barricade on a pontoon bridge, creating difficulties in crowd management.Following the incident, the seer began a sit-in protest outside the Shankaracharya camp, demanding an apology and a dignified escort for the ritual bath. He later announced that he would not take a dip until the administration apologised for misbehaviour towards him and his followers.Amid the row, the Mela administration issued a notice seeking an explanation on his use of the title of Shankaracharya of Jyotish Peeth, citing a civil appeal pending before the Supreme Court. The seer hit back, questioning how camps of two Shankaracharyas from Puri were allowed at the same mela.The issue has since triggered political and administrative reactions. Prashant Kumar Singh, a deputy commissioner in the Uttar Pradesh GST department posted in Ayodhya, resigned from service citing moral reasons and said that he was hurt by baseless allegations against the chief minister and the prime minister by the seer.Bareilly city magistrate Alankar Agnihotri also resigned, citing concerns over the alleged insult to Swami Avimukteshwaranand and broader social issues.The Congress has announced an awareness campaign against the insult of the Shankaracharya. Party leaders have accused the state administration of insensitivity and demanded that the governor take suo motu cognisance of the matter and initiate action.",Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati asked Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath to stop beef exports from the state.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday ruled that the right to menstrual hygiene is an integral part of the right to life and the right to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution.The top court has issued a series of binding directions to states, Union Territories and schools to ensure dignity, health and equality for girls and women.The order was given by the bench of Justices JB Pardiwala and R Mahadevan. Pronouncing its judgment on a plea seeking free sanitary pads and adequate sanitation facilities for schoolgirls, the apex court directed all states and Union Territories to provide biodegradable sanitary napkins free of cost to girl students in all schools.“Before parting with the issue, we want to say that this pronouncement is not just for stakeholders of the legal system. It is also meant for classrooms where girls hesitate to ask for help. It is for teachers who want to help but are not able to due to the lack of resources. Progress is measured by how we protect the vulnerable”, Justice Pardiwala observed before parting with the judgment.It also ordered authorities to ensure separate toilets for female and male students, along with disability-friendly toilets, in every school.The apex body made it clear that the compliance would be mandatory for both government and private institutions. It warned that private schools could face derecognition if they fail to provide separate toilets for girls and boys or do not ensure access to free sanitary pads for students.The bench said that access to menstrual hygiene is not a matter of charity or policy discretion, but a constitutional entitlement flowing from the right to live with dignity and bodily autonomy.The top court further directed that it will hold government accountable if they fail to provide toilets and free sanitary pads to girls.It observed that lack of basic facilities and stigma around menstruation directly affects girls’ health, education and privacy.The judgment follows proceedings initiated in November last year, when the court took cognisance of a disturbing incident at Maharshi Dayanand University in Haryana, where three women sanitation workers were allegedly forced to send photographs of their sanitary pads to prove they were menstruating. The incident had triggered nationwide outrage over “period-shaming”.At that stage, a bench of Justices BV Nagarathna and R Mahadevan had expressed concern over such practices in educational institutions and workplaces, observing that they reflected a deeply troubling mindset.The court had issued notice to the Centre on a petition filed by the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), which highlighted multiple instances of women and girls being subjected to invasive and degrading checks.In its petition, the SCBA argued that such practices were “in gross violation of their right to life, dignity, privacy and bodily integrity under Article 21”.It also stressed that women workers, particularly in the unorganised sector, are entitled to decent working conditions that respect biological differences and protect them from humiliating treatment during menstruation.During the earlier hearing, the court had observed that if a woman was unable to perform heavy work due to menstruation-related pain, alternative arrangements should be made instead of subjecting her to degrading scrutiny.“If someone is saying that because of this reason heavy work could not be done, it could have been accepted and some other persons could have been deployed,” the bench had said, expressing hope that meaningful guidelines would emerge from the case.The Haryana government had informed the court that an inquiry had been initiated into the university incident and that action had been taken against two persons responsible.","The top court has issued a series of binding directions to states, Union Territories and schools.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said on Friday that it is up to the NCP to choose its next leader following the untimely demise of party chief and Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar.The BJP leader added that both his party and the state government would support whatever decision the NCP makes.“The decision will be taken by the NCP. We will stand by whatever decision the NCP takes...We are standing by the family of Ajit Pawar and the NCP,,” he told reporters in Mumbai.Fadnavis added that he would also review the procedures required to finalise the state budget, which Pawar—who also held the crucial portfolio—was due to present next month.“He had already done significant work on the state budget. Starting tomorrow, I will personally oversee the remaining processes, and we will decide on the next steps,” the chief minister stated.His remarks came amid reports that the NCP would hold a legislative party meeting on Saturday to elect Rajya Sabha MP Sunetra Pawar, Ajit Pawar’s wife, to succeed the Maratha heavyweight as both the legislative party leader and as the deputy chief minister of Maharashtra and, later, possibly as NCP president.However, Fadnavis declined to comment on Sunetra Pawar being sworn in as the deputy CM.She made her electoral debut in last year’s Lok Sabha election, where she was defeated by her sister-in-law and Ajit Pawar’s cousin, Supriya Sule, in the family’s Baramati stronghold.Ajit Pawar, 66, who broke away from his uncle, veteran politician Sharad Pawar, in 2023 to join the BJP and Shiv Sena-led Mahayuti alliance, was the state’s longest-serving deputy chief minister, having held the post for six terms.He died on Wednesday morning when the private aircraft he was travelling in from Mumbai crashed during an emergency landing in Baramati, where he was scheduled to address a rally.

‘Some Historians, Politicians Tried To Whitewash History Of Invaders’: PM Modi Hits Out In Somnath

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) on Friday strongly criticised former Vice President Hamid Ansari over his remarks describing Sultan of the Ghaznavid Empire Mahmud of Ghazni as an Indian. The party accused him of distorting history and attempting to “whitewash” the brutal invasions of India.Ansari, who served as Vice President during the Congress-led UPA governments from 2007 to 2012 and again from 2012 to 2017, had said that figures commonly described as foreign invaders in textbooks were, in fact, Indians.“Those whom we describe in our textbooks as foreign invaders—whether it is the Lodhis or Ghazni—were all Indian plunderers. They did not come from outside,” Ansari said.Reacting sharply, BJP National Spokesperson CR Kesavan questioned the Congress party’s position on Ansari’s statement and accused it of attempting to sanitise violent episodes from history.In a post on X, Kesavan said the remarks were “shocking” and recalled that Ansari had been the Congress-led UPA’s choice for Vice President twice.“Ghazni was not a foreign invader, he was Indian'! Indeed shocking remarks by former Vice President Shri Hamid Ansari ji, who was the Congress led UPA govt's choice for the post of Vice President, not once but twice. Does the Congress leadership and Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi agree with such whitewashing of mercenary brutal raids as mere domestic acts, which demolished Hindu temples and murdered thousands?” Kesavan said.He alleged that Islamic invasions beginning in the early eighth century had systematically targeted Hindu religious sites.Kesavan further said Mahmud of Ghazni carried out 17 raids into India in the 11th century, during which he claimed major temples such as those in Mathura and Somnath were attacked.He also linked the issue to the Congress party’s historical opposition to the reconstruction of the Somnath temple.Shehzad Poonawala, also attacked the Congress over Ansari’s comments, accusing the party of consistently “eulogising Hindu haters” and downplaying atrocities committed against Hindus.Speaking to ANI, Poonawala said, “The Congress ecosystem always eulogises Hindu haters. Whoever attacks or commits atrocities on Hindus is always subjected to whitewashing by the Congress ecosystem. Now, Hamid Ansari says that Ghazni was not a cruel person, that he was just an Indian. It shows the Hindu hatred they have in their mind.”Poonawala also expanded his criticism to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, accusing him of disrespecting constitutional institutions and national traditions by skipping key official events.“‘Sena and Samvidhan ka apmaan is Congress’s pehchaan’. Rahul Gandhi feels his family is above the Constitution and the Army. For him, ‘parivar tantra’ is more important than ‘samvidhan tantra’,” he alleged.","BJP National Spokesperson CR Kesavan accused Congress of attempting to sanitise violent episodes from history.

NCP factions eyeing February merger?

Will Ajit Pawar’s death speed up reunification?



Who will fill the vacuum?



Maharashtra ’s power dynamics



NEW DELHI: The sudden death of Maharashtra deputy chief minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Ajit Pawar in a plane crash has triggered fresh churn in the state’s politics, reopening talks of a reunification of the two NCP factions led by the Pawars.The rumoured merger of the two NCP factions led by Ajit Pawar and his uncle Sharad Pawar is ""very much on course"", with talks having reached an ""advanced stage"" even before the deputy chief minister’s death in Wednesday’s plane crash, sources aware of the talks told news agency PTI.""The process of bringing the family and the party back together was already in motion. Ajit dada himself had held several rounds of discussions with senior leaders to bridge the gap,"" the sources said.The tragedy, they say, may now accelerate the process rather than stall it.Negotiators from both the ruling NCP and the Sharad Pawar-led NCP (SP) confirmed that discussions were well underway, with a tentative announcement earlier planned for February 8, shortly after the Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti elections, the agency said.The two factions had already ""tested the waters"" by jointly contesting the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad civic polls under the NCP’s clock symbol, which was a clear sign of a thaw after the dramatic 2023 split.Sources said Ajit Pawar had meticulously planned the reunification of the two NCP factions and viewed the merger as part of a long-term strategy, keeping the 2029 elections and the party’s future relevance in mind. He was confident the reunion would take place with the consent of his uncle, Sharad Pawar.Reunification was also Ajit Pawar’s last wish, according to Kiran Gujar, a member of Vidya Pratishthan and a close associate of the Pawar family for over four decades.Speaking to reporters after the immersion of Ajit Pawar’s ashes, Gujar said, ""Today, the ashes of Ajit Pawar were immersed at Sangam here. It was ‘Dada’s’ last wish that this (merger of two factions of NCP) should happen. All should be united. Talks about this were happening throughout the family. In my last phone call with him, he had asked me for some election-related papers.""""He was one hundred per cent keen on merging both the factions. He had told me five days ago that the entire process was complete and the merger was imminent in the next few days,"" Gujar told PTI.Asked whether Ajit Pawar had discussed the issue with Sharad Pawar, Gujar said that ""positive talks were underway with Pawar saheb, Supriya Tai (Supriya Sule) and other leaders"", and there were indications that the senior Pawar would endorse the move.""Many positive things were on the cards, but this tragedy struck and took Ajit 'Dada' away from us. Now, after his death, it has become even more imperative that both factions come together and work for the betterment of Baramati and the state,"" he said.Just days before the fatal plane crash, Ajit Pawar had also met NCP (SP) leader Jayant Patil to finalise organisational unity and power-sharing arrangements. Even as merger talks gathered momentum, a section of party workers in the NCP has begun debating Ajit Pawar’s successor.Ajit Pawar himself had earlier told TOI that reuniting the party was his immediate political goal, with the blessings of Sharad Pawar.The moment carries a stark irony. Ajit Pawar was the architect of the 2023 split that fractured the NCP and aligned a majority of its legislators with the BJP–Shiv Sena-led Mahayuti government, leaving Sharad Pawar’s faction in opposition.Yet, despite the split, Ajit Pawar retained the party’s official identity, with the Election Commission recognising his group as the ""real"" NCP and awarding it the ""watch"" symbol.Ajit Pawar’s death has left the ruling NCP without a clear leader, triggering uncertainty over both leadership and key cabinet portfolios, including finance and excise, which he handled. With senior leader Chhagan Bhujbal unwell, the leadership question has become more urgent.While the Sharad Pawar-led NCP (SP) believes the veteran leader will naturally return to a ""central role"" in guiding a unified party, the ruling NCP is keen to preserve the Pawar family’s political legacy.The NCP will hold a meeting of its legislature party on January 31 to formally name Sunetra Pawar, wife of the late deputy chief minister, as its leader, Bhujbal said on Friday.Speaking to reporters at the NCP office, Bhujbal said chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has conveyed that he has no objection to Sunetra Pawar taking oath as deputy chief minister as early as Saturday, provided the legislature party takes a formal decision.Ajit Pawar’s NCP currently holds 40 MLAs, while the Sharad Pawar faction has 10.A merged party would command over 50 MLAs, potentially altering equations within the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance and the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA).However, even if a unified NCP were to exit the ruling alliance, the Devendra Fadnavis government would remain secure, with the Mahayuti holding 235 MLAs in the 288-member Assembly.Political analysts say the bigger impact could be in western Maharashtra, the NCP’s traditional ""sugar belt"" — where the BJP has made recent inroads.For now, the February 7 local body polls will act as a ""coordinated tribute"" to the late leader, with both NCP factions contesting together under the clock symbol, seen as a prelude to a possible reunification after the results are declared on February 9.","The rumoured merger of the two NCP factions led by Ajit Pawar and his uncle Sharad Pawar is ""very much on course"", sources say.

Blatant lie: Gaurav Gogoi slams Assam CM Himanta Sarma over ‘Miya Muslims’ remarks; alleges misuse of SC's name,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/blatant-lie-gaurav-gogoi-slams-assam-cm-himanta-sarma-over-miya-muslims-remarks-alleges-misuse-of-scs-name/articleshow/127804280.cms,"Photo credit: ANI

Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi, who represents Assam ’s Jorhat constituency, on Friday sharply criticised chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma over his “Miya Muslims” remarks, accusing him of “misusing” the name of the Supreme Court to justify his statements and calling his claims a “blatant lie.”In a post on X, Gogoi described Sarma’s politics as driven by “dishonesty and shamelessness” and alleged that the chief minister falsely attributed certain words to the apex court in the Sarbananda Sonowal case.“Dishonesty and shamelessness define Himanta Biswa Sarma's politics. He has stooped so low that he is misusing the name of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. He claims to rely on the Hon'ble Court's 'own words' from the case of Sarbananda Sonowal. This is a blatant lie,” Gogoi wrote in his X post.He added, “The language he quotes is not the Supreme Court's. The Hon'ble Court neither authored the said words nor adopted it. To pass off an executive report as a judicial pronouncement is a deliberate contempt.”Gogoi further said that a chief minister attributing words incorrectly to the Supreme Court amounts to a violation of constitutional norms and urged the court to take note.“For a chief minister holding a constitutional office to falsely attribute words to the Hon'ble Supreme Court is not just contemptuous, it is an assault on constitutional propriety and institutional integrity. The Hon'ble Supreme Court may take cognisance of the remarks of Himanta Biswa Sarma that violate the Constitution and falsely attribute to the Court,” he said.The Congress MP’s remarks came after Sarma defended his comments on “Miya Muslim” in the context of alleged Bangladeshi infiltrators and said the Supreme Court itself had expressed concern over the influx of immigrants into Assam.Responding to criticism from the opposition, Sarma told reporters, “Those who have come from Bangladesh call themselves 'Miya'. I did not give them that name; it is they who call themselves that,” ANI reported.He added, “They only said to call them Miya. They wrote Miya poetry. If we say 'miya, miya', they can also call us 'Assamese, Assamese'; and what is the problem with that?”In a separate post on X, Sarma said critics should read the Supreme Court’s observations on Assam and illegal migration.“Those who are attacking me for my remarks on ""Miyan""--a word used in Assam in the context of Bangladeshi Muslim illegal migration--should pause and read what the Supreme Court of India itself has said about Assam. This is not my language, not my imagination, and not political exaggeration,” he said.",Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi accuses Himanta Biswa Sarma of misusing the name of the Supreme Court to justify his statements.

Final ops on to target ‘Big 4’ as Naxal-free deadline nears,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/final-ops-on-to-target-big-4-as-naxal-free-deadline-nears/articleshow/127811988.cms,".

NEW DELHI: As the March 31, 2026 deadline for making the country ""Naxal-free"" approaches, the security forces are in the final leg of intelligence-based operations to get the remaining 'Big Four' of the apex CPI(Maoist) leadership -- three politburo-cum-central committee members and one central committee member -- and an estimated ""300-350 regular, uniformed cadres of concern"" still out there in the jungles.""Time is running out for these leaders, and full-time cadres spread across Chhattisgarh (around 200-250) and totalling no more than 10-20 each in Telangana, Jharkhand, Odisha and Maharashtra. They must choose between eschewing the path of violence and being confronted by the security forces in their hideouts across the Indravati national park area, small pockets of Jharkhand, and the inter-state borders of Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Maharashtra and Telangana,” Bastar range Inspector General P Sundarraj told TOI.There are only four surviving politburo (PB) and central committee (CC) members, of which two are not known to be active. Thippiri Tirupathi @ Devji is the de facto No. 1, though not formally anointed as the CPI(Maoist) general secretary. Former general secretary Muppalla Laxman Rao @ Ganpathy is in his late seventies and supposedly ailing. Misir Besra, who is heading the CPI(Maoist) Eastern Regional Bureau since his predecessor Prashant Bose's arrest in 2021 and is the only non-Telugu face in PB, is currently operating in the Saranda forests of Jharkhand, where his aide and CC member Patiram Manjhi @ Anal Da was killed only a few days ago.The forces are already on Besra's trail. Malla Raji Reddy @ Sangram, who is in charge of Maoist operations in Odisha, is not known to have been involved in any active operations for quite some time.Though some state police have a 5th CC member — Asim Mondal — in their ‘active’ list, opinion is divided on whether he indeed is part of the CC.Devji, though currently No. 1 in CP( Moist), is debilitated by the series of killings and surrenders by his PB/CC colleagues, senior commanders and armed cadres in the past year or so. ""There have been multiple public appeals for surrender, including at the political level, but Devji may prefer to go down fighting, holding on to Maoist ideology,"" said a senior officer.As a senior MHA functionary had told TOI earlier, the “end” of Left-wing extremism may not mean there will be no incidents of Maoist violence. “But such incidents will be isolated and dealt with at the police station level. CPI(Maoist) will no longer have an organised, cadre-based strength operating across states,” said the officer.Between January 1, 2025, and January 22, 2026, a dozen central committee members, including general secretary and politburo member Basavaraju, were neutralised by the counter-Naxal forces, and five opted for surrender. There are still two senior commanders -- Pappa Rao and Prabhakar, both members of the Dandkarenya special zonal committee (DKSZC) — on the loose. They are said to be active in the inter-state border of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, covering Kanker, Gadchiroli and south of Indravati.The flood of Maoist surrenders last year, including by PB and CC member Mallojula Venugopal alias Sonu; CC members Chandranna and Sujata in Telangana; and Ramder and Rupesh in Chhattisgarh, along with the huge dent in Naxal arsenal with the recovery of 698 weapons and 915 IEDs in Chhattisgarh alone over the past year, have left the Maoists a depleted army on ventilator support.","There are only four surviving politburo (PB) and central committee (CC) members, of which two are not known to be active.

Palestine’s foreign minister Varsen Aghabekian on Friday said that India would decide on joining the proposed Gaza “Board of Peace” in line with its own understanding of peace. She further stressed that any genuine effort to end the conflict should be welcomed.Speaking on the US-backed initiative announced by President Donald Trump, Aghabekian said, “India will decide in line with its understanding of peace, international law. Each country can decide on its own, and each country would look at its interests”.Aghabekian underlined that the participation in the proposed body should be guided by national priorities and respect for international norms.Welcoming diplomatic efforts to end the Gaza war, the Palestinian minister said that any attempt to forge peace was positive. At the same time, she cautioned against external pressure shaping global responses to the conflict.Commenting on Pakistan’s reported inclusion in the proposed body, Aghabekian said that Israel must stop dictating what is acceptable to the international community.She also flagged broader regional risks, observing that continued instability, including tensions between the United States and Iran, was a concern for all countries and had direct implications for Gaza and the wider West Asian region.The remarks come after Trump announced the formation of a “Board of Peace” to oversee post-war governance and reconstruction in Gaza, calling it a key step in the second phase of a US-backed plan to end the conflict.In a post on Truth Social, Trump described the body as the “greatest and most prestigious board ever assembled”.According to the White House, the Board of Peace will function as a new international organisation and transitional governing authority for Gaza, focusing on governance reform, reconstruction, economic investment and long-term stability.India has been formally invited to join the proposed board. In a letter shared by US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor, Trump said the initiative was part of a broader 20-point “Comprehensive Plan” to end the Gaza conflict, first announced in September last year and later endorsed by the UN Security Council through Resolution 2803 in November.New Delhi had received an invitation to join the initiative but has not officially accepted or rejected the offer.Alongside the Board of Peace, Washington has announced the formation of a 15-member Palestinian technocratic body—the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza—which will manage day-to-day governance once the war ends.The committee is expected to operate under the supervision of the proposed board. The plan also includes deploying an international stabilisation force and training selected Palestinian police units.Confirmed members of the Board of Peace include US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump’s special negotiator Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, former UK prime minister Tony Blair, US financier Marc Rowan, World Bank President Ajay Banga and senior US National Security Council aide Robert Gabriel.A separate Gaza Executive Board will support implementation on the ground, with participation from international diplomats and regional representatives, including from Turkey, Qatar, Egypt, Israel and the United Arab Emirates.Apart from India, countries such as Argentina, Canada, Egypt, Turkey, Albania and Cyprus have been invited. Pakistan has also confirmed receiving an invitation, with its foreign office saying that Islamabad would continue supporting international efforts for peace and security in Gaza.According to a Bloomberg report, a draft charter of the Trump-led Board of Peace proposes that countries contribute $1 billion to secure long-term membership, with the US president retaining authority over membership and final decision-making.",Varsen Aghabekian said that India would decide on joining the proposed Gaza “Board of Peace” in line with its own understanding of peace.

Amit Shah Blames Infiltration For Muslim Population Growth, Backs CAA As Moral Responsibility

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday accused the Congress of “changing” the poll-bound state’s demography, a “trend” he said the current BJP-led government at the Centre is working to “reverse.”Shah made the remarks at the closing ceremony of the 10th Mising Youth Festival at Kareng Chapori in Assam's Dhemaji. He also urged the people to vote for the state BJP government in the upcoming assembly elections to ""completely free"" Assam from infiltration.“Assam’s demography completely changed during Congress rule. The population of infiltrators rose to 64 lakh from nil, and infiltrators became the majority in seven districts,” the senior BJP leader alleged.“If you want to stop infiltration, then elect the BJP government for a third term and strengthen the hands of chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma . Two BJP state governments in Assam have freed 1.26 lakh acres of land from encroachment by infiltrators,” he added.The BJP first came to power in Assam in May 2016 and won re-election five years later. It is now aiming for a third consecutive term when the state goes to polls in April.Meanwhile, Shah also highlighted the role played by the Mising community in preventing infiltrators from settling in Upper Assam through their hardworking lifestyle.“It is the responsibility of the Mising community to stop infiltration. You do not need to take up guns. Through your culture of hard work, infiltrators have not been able to settle here,” he remarked.The home minister further alleged that several tribal communities in Assam struggled to protect their identity during the Congress regime, while asserting that the BJP was committed to addressing the issues of the Mising society through an interlocutor appointed by the Centre.","Shah made the remarks at the closing ceremony of the 10th Mising Youth Festival.

Congress Chief Kharge Demands Ban On RSS Citing Sardar Patel's 1948 Letter, BJP Hits Back

NEW DELHI: On the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh shared two historic letters from 1948, written by Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to Syama Prasad Mookerjee. The letters shared criticise the activities of Hindu Mahasabha and RSS.Ramesh took to social media platform X to share these pieces of history, alongside a link to Nehru's radio address from the night of Gandhi's assassination on January 30, 1948.In his letter, Nehru had said, ""Speeches were delivered that Mahatma Gandhi was an impediment and the sooner he died the better it would be for the country....The RSS has behaved in an even worse way and we have collected a mass of information about its very objectionable activities...""Ramesh's social media post included screenshots of both letters. Ramesh called these letters ""damning indictments of the self-declared custodians of nationalism."" ""And to think that there is a Lok Sabha MP wedded to that ideology and who was blessed by the PM himself, who said that he could not choose between Gandhi and Godse. His mindset is revealing,"" he added, apparently taking a dig at BJP MP Abhijit Gangopadhyay's controversial remarks in 2024, according to PTI.The timing of these letters was significant. Nehru wrote his letter just two days before Gandhi's assassination. Patel's letter came later, on July 18, 1948. Both leaders expressed strong criticism of the Hindu organisations' activities during that crucial period in Indian history.Mahatma Gandhi was killed by Nathuram Godse on January 30, 1948.","Congress leader Jairam Ramesh shared two historic letters from 1948.

NEW DELHI: The security forces intensified their anti-terror operation in the Kishtwar district of Jammu and Kashmir against three Jaish terrorists. The operation launched in the Chatroo area of Kishtwar has also led to the continued suspension of internet services.Areas within the 6km range covering Singpura, Arigam Dwathar and Naidgam also continue to face internet suspension since January 23, which has been extended till Friday, 11.59pm, as per an order issued by the Jammu and Kashmir home department.News agency PTI reported, citing the officials, that the suspension has been put in force to curtail anti-national activities that could disrupt the security operation.The operation, which began on 18 January in the snowbound region, has been hampered by difficult geography despite multiple contacts. The terrorists managed to escape the confrontation utilising the environment to evade capture.The encounter on the first day of the operation led to one paratrooper being killed while injuring seven other soldiers. Following this, encounters on January 22 at the Mali Dana top and that on January 25 in the Janseer-Kandiwar region also ended with the insurgents escaping the scene in thick vegetation and snowbound terrain.Parallel to the Kishtwar hunt, a separate search operation is underway in the Surankote area of Poonch district.Following the reports of two suspicious individuals near Pajja Morh and Nabana top, troops have cordoned off the sector. As of the latest reports, no contact has been established with the suspects.This heightened military activity comes a week after a significant victory for security forces, when a high-ranking Pakistani JeM operative was killed in the Kathua district.The current manhunt in Kishtwar is seen as a continuation of efforts to dismantle JeM cells operating within the region’s dense forest belts.","Security forces intensified their anti-terror operation in the Kishtwar district of Jammu and Kashmir against three Jaish terrorists.

The complaint, filed by a team of KPCC lawyers at the Cyber Crime Police Station in Bengaluru, alleges the post falsely accused Congress leaders of “looting” the state and sought to damage their reputations.According to the complaint, the BJP post carried images of the CM, DCM and other ministers under the caption “Scam Lords”, and was “misleading, malicious and aimed at tarnishing reputations without substantiation”.

AR Rahman Responds to Ramayan Controversy, Calls Epic a Story of Values Beyond Religion

New Delhi: As Republic Day celebrations drew to a close with the Beating Retreat ceremony, Vijay Chowk reverberated with three of composer AR Rahman's iconic songs - Oscar-winning 'Jai ho', 'Bharat humko jaan se pyaara hai' and 'Ma tujhe salaam'.Earlier this month, when asked about his absence from Hindi-film music during an interview with BBC Asian Network, Rahman said, ""It might be a communal thing also... but it is not in my face"". He later said that intentions could be ""misundersood sometimes"" and that he was grateful to the country.While the Central Armed Police Forces band performed ""Jai Ho"", the Indian Navy band played 'Bharat humko...'.The song 'Aarambh hai prachand' from the movie Gulaal was played by the Indian Army band. Vande Mataram on its 150th anniversary and Operation Sindoor were featured prominently during the ceremony on Thursday evening, which was presided over by President Droupadi Murmu, who arrived in the ceremonial buggy. Vice-President CP Radhakrishnan, PM Narendra Modi , defence minister Rajnath Singh, Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, and the three service chiefs were also present.The bands stood various formations that included 'Amar Jawan': a tribute to Indian Army bravehearts, 'Deva Vyuha: a battle formation referred to in Mahabharata battle formation against Bhishm Pitamah and 'Ardhachandra Vyuha': a half-moon battle formation.LED screens placed at the venue also showed a video clip of a BrahMos missile hitting a target; instruments of several band members were wrapped with LEDs on which the logo of Op Sindoor shone. Images of Rafale, Tejas, Su-30, BrahMos, S-400 air defence system, Netra, Prachand and C-130 also played on the screens.Later, the PM shared the glimpses from Beating Retreat 2026, saying that ""performances by the various bands were memorable"".In a series of posts on X, Modi said: ""Air Force Band was exceptional... They performed 'Brave Warrior', 'Twilight', 'Alert (Post Horn Gallop)' and 'Flying Star' impeccably. The Sindoor formation was brilliant!""On the naval band, he posted, ""Simply outstanding! The Naval Band's performances included 'Namaste', 'Sagar Pawan', 'Matribhumi', 'Tejasvi' and 'Jai Bharati'.

He says I too can bring change. We all need to be prepared to save mother Ladakh and mother India.

It was meant to say that after liberating Ladakh from Kashmir, the central govt failed to extend its promise of constitutional safeguards under the 6th Schedule.

Read Apple CEO Tim Cook’s memo to employees

Team,

I’m heartbroken by the events in Minneapolis, and my prayers and deepest sympathies are with the families, with the communities, and with everyone that’s been affected.

This is a time for deescalation. I believe America is strongest when we live up to our highest ideals, when we treat everyone with dignity and respect no matter who they are or where they’re from, and when we embrace our shared humanity.

This is something Apple has always advocated for. I had a good conversation with the president this week where I shared my views, and I appreciate his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all.

I know this is very emotional and challenging for so many. I am proud of how deeply our teams care about the world beyond our walls. That empathy is one of Apple’s greatest strengths and it is something I believe we all cherish.

Thank you for all that you do.

Tim

Apple CEO Tim Cook has broken his silence on the Minneapolis shootings, telling employees he's ""heartbroken"" that left two people dead at the hands of federal immigration agents, telling employees he's ""heartbroken"" and believes America must live up to its highest ideals. In an internal memo sent Tuesday, as obtained by Bloomberg, Cook revealed he discussed the situation with US President Trump earlier this week.The memo comes as Cook faces mounting criticism for his proximity to the Trump administration. On Saturday, just hours after ICE agents fatally shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti—an intensive care nurse at the US Department of Veterans Affairs—Cook was spotted at a VIP screening of the ""Melania"" documentary at the White House.""This is a time for de-escalation,"" Cook wrote in Tuesday's message to staff.

In newly released documents of Epstein files, an email caught everyone's attention as it mentioned Microsoft founder Bill Gates , who got sexually transmitted disease from “Russian girls.”Screenshots of alleged 2013 self-emails attributed to Jeffrey Epstein claimed Bill Gates contracted a sexually transmitted disease from “Russian girls” and asked for antibiotics to secretly give to his then-wife, Melinda.The allegations were not verified and were heavily disputed by context and prior denials from Gates. None of the claims were substantiated.The claims appeared in what were described as screenshots of self-emails written by Epstein, among a new tranche of hundreds of thousands of documents released by the DOJ on Friday.According to the documents released Friday by the Department of Justice, Epstein wrote a lengthy message to himself on July 18, 2013, lashing out at Gates for ending their relationship and alleging efforts to cover up personal matters, the US Sun reported.In one passage, Epstein allegedly wrote: “TO add insult to the injury you them (sic) implore me to please delete the emails regarding your std, your request that I provide you antibiotics that you can surreptitiously give to Melinda and the description of your *****.”Earlier in the same message, Epstein said he had been “dismayed beyond comprehension” by Gates’s decision to “disregard our friendship developed over the last six years.”In that email, Epstein allegedly wrote: “I have been caught up in a severe marital dispute between Melinda and Bill…”He continued: “In my role as his right hand man I have been asked and wrongly acquiesced into participating in things that have ranged from the morally inappropriate, to the ethically unsound and have been repeatedly asked to do thing (sic) that get near and potentially over the line into the illegal…”Gates previously said he regretted his association with Epstein, who died in a New York City jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges, and long denied any wrongdoing.In the last released documents, multiple undated images showing Epstein and Gates together in various locations were present. In one photograph, Gates was seen smiling next to a woman whose face was redacted.Gates and Melinda were married from 1994 to 2021. Melinda said Gates’s affairs and his relationship with Epstein were factors in their divorce, without providing further detail. She reportedly hired divorce lawyers in 2019 after concerns over Gates’s alleged dealings with Epstein, according to The Wall Street Journal.Meanwhile, Bill Gates, through his philanthropic foundation, has issued a strongly worded denial calling the information ""absurd and completely false.""",Alleged 2013 self-emails attributed to Jeffrey Epstein claimed Bill Gates contracted a sexually transmitted disease from “Russian girls” The allegations were not verified and were heavily disputed by context and prior denials from Gates.

After 500 years of searching, scientists may have found Vitruvius’ legendary basilica

De architectura

Excavation site in Fano reveals strong alignment

Archaeologists describe an unusually precise match

Cultural impact rooted in classical theory

The next steps and public access remain uncertain





Italy has identified the remains of a Roman public building in the city of Fano that closely match the only known written description of a basilica attributed to Vitruvius, the ancient architect whose ideas shaped Western architecture. The structure, buried beneath the later layers of the city, dates back more than 2,000 years and appears to match the dimensions, layout, and proportions recorded in his writings. Archaeologists say the discovery offers rare physical proof of theories that survived mostly on paper for centuries. Officials describe the site as unusually precise in its correspondence with classical texts, a quality seldom seen in Roman archaeology. Further excavation will determine the extent of the find's preservation and the possibility of public access.Vitruvius lived in the first century BC and is best known for writing, a ten-volume treatise that set out principles of proportion, symmetry and construction. His work became a foundation for Renaissance architecture and later academic teaching, even though almost none of his buildings had ever been securely identified.Scholars debated for generations whether the basilica he described in Fano was a real structure or merely theoretical. The current excavation has practically reopened that question.The site lies in the historic centre of Fano, a coastal town northeast of Rome. Archaeologists uncovered wall foundations and column bases that form a rectangular plan. According to Andrea Pessina, regional archaeological superintendent, the structure matches Vitruvius’ description down to the number and placement of columns. Ten columns appear along the long sides, with four along the shorter ends. When excavators calculated where a missing column should be based on the text, they dug in that exact spot and found it. Such accuracy is rare, even in well-documented Roman sites.Researchers involved in the project have been cautious but visibly struck by the results. Pessina said there are few certainties in archaeology, yet the correspondence between text and remains was difficult to dismiss. Mayor Luca Serfilippi described the basilica as something scholars had searched for over 500 years. Italian Culture Minister Alessandro Giuli called it a discovery that would be discussed far into the future. These comments were made at a press conference in Rome, where officials formally presented the findings.Vitruvius’ influence extends far beyond ancient Rome. His ideas on proportion famously inspired Leonardo da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man, a drawing that links human anatomy to architectural balance. Finding a building that appears to follow those principles in physical form gives historians a reference point that has long been missing. It allows comparison between theory and construction, something usually inferred rather than observed.Only part of the basilica has been excavated so far. Officials say further digging will determine whether more of the structure survives underground and whether it can be safely displayed. Conservation concerns remain, especially given its location within a modern city. The reporting on the discovery was published by Reuters, whose account brought international attention to the find. For now, the site rests quietly beneath Fano, offering more questions than answers and a rare pause between text and stone.","Vitruvius lived in the first century BC and is best known for writing, a ten- volume treatise that set out principles of proportion, symmetry and construction.

What the Borsum hoard tells us about Roman times



Metal detecting in Lower Saxony reveals hidden Roman treasures







Northern Germany's fields and forests have held quiet secrets for decades. Near Borsum, in a woodland, something remarkable surfaced, each conveying a remarkable tale. A Roman-era hoard was found, considered as one of the largest in regions containing 450 silver coins, including one gold coin, a ring, and several silver bars. According to the experts, as cited in Earth.com, the discovery seems small at first glance, yet it’s enormous in historical importance. Archaeologists are carefully studying it with each coin, each bar telling a different story segment about trade, conflict, and about daily life at the northern edge of the empire.According to reports, the discovery came after an archaeological sweep led by Sebastian Messal, the regional department head at the Lower Saxony State Office for Monument Preservation, leading the study. The hoard is more than a buried treasure, he explained. People in the past might have feared theft, unrest, or invasion. Locking the value underground was safer than carrying it around.The team is cleaning coins and bars carefully, including inscriptions, mint marks, and wear, for further examination. Small details may reveal which emperors ruled when the hoard was buried. Experts say these clues help map trade and circulation in the early Imperial period.It seems strange, maybe even romantic, that a collection of metal can connect us to lives almost 2,000 years ago.Metal detecting in Lower Saxony is tightly controlled, which requires training and permits. Early digging at the site reportedly disturbed some context. Archaeologists returned and recovered additional coins, piecing together the deposit. Messal notes that even with early interference, enough remains to reconstruct patterns. It might show short-term savings or long-term accumulation.Coins and bars are being analysed with care. Non-destructive tests reveal silver content. Gold pieces hint at high-status ownership.","Coins and bars are being analysed with care.

Landslide leads to mine collapse in Congo; over 200 killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/landslide-leads-to-mine-collapse-in-congo-over-200-killed/articleshow/127813025.cms,"Representative image





A mine collapse triggered by a landslide in Rubaya, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, killed more than 200 people on Wednesday, local authorities said.The collapse occurred at a coltan mine that produces around 15 per cent of the world’s supply of the mineral, which is processed into tantalum used in mobile phones, computers, aerospace components and gas turbines.Lumumba Kambere Muyisa, spokesperson for the rebel-appointed governor of the province, said the exact toll remains unclear. “More than 200 people were victims of this landslide, including miners, children and market women. Some people were rescued just in time and have serious injuries,” he told Reuters, adding that about 20 injured people were being treated in health facilities.He said the collapse was linked to seasonal conditions. “We are in the rainy season. The ground is fragile. It was the ground that gave way while the victims were in the hole.”An adviser to the governor said the number of confirmed dead was at least 227.The Rubaya mine has been under the control of the AFC/M23 rebel group since 2024. The United Nations says the group has plundered the area’s mineral resources to help fund its insurgency, backed by the government of neighboring Rwanda, an allegation Kigali denies.The heavily armed rebels say their aim is to overthrow the government in Kinshasa and ensure the safety of the Congolese Tutsi minority. They captured more mineral-rich territory in eastern Congo during a rapid advance last year.","A mine collapse triggered by a landslide in Rubaya, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, killed more than 200 people.

Trump To Pull Out ICE From Minnesota? Panic Hits White House After Fiery Backlash From MAGA Voters





: In a move that underscores the MAGA v Moderate Republican politics in the US heartland, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Wednesday announced a sweeping investigation into alleged abuse of the federal H-1B visa program, targeting what his office described as fraudulent schemes that disadvantage U.S. workers.Paxton said his office issued Civil Investigative Demands (CIDs) to the three North Texas companies requiring them to turn over records related to their operations, employees, and visa sponsorship practices. The businesses, which are purportedly run by Indians according to local media reports, are suspected of creating “sham companies” and maintaining “ghost offices” in order to improperly obtain H-1B visas for foreign workers.According to the attorney general’s office, some entities allegedly used misleading websites advertising products or services that do not exist, with the sole purpose of justifying visa sponsorships. “Any criminal who attempts to scam the H-1B visa program and use ‘ghost offices’ or other fraudulent ploys should be prepared to face the full force of the law,” Paxton said in a statement, arguing that such abuse “strips jobs and opportunities away from Texans.” His office also launched a public tip portal to solicit information on potential violations.As of this week, no charges have been filed, and the companies under investigation – which Paxton did not name – have not publicly responded. Local reports named two of the companies: Qubitz Tech Systems LLC, which reportedly has 13 approved H-1B visa employees; and 3BEES Technologies, with 27 H-1B visas approved between 2022 and 2025.Industry insiders say Paxton and the MAGA media are mischaracterizing a standard business model in the IT consulting world, where a ""bodyshop"" often has a small administrative footprint (sometimes a home office) because its workers are physically located at the offices of major clients (like banks or telecom giants). Several Indian IT companies, including TCS, Infosys, and Wipro, have large operations in Texas, employing thousands of workers, including native-born Americans.But Paxton’s investigation seeks to prove some of the smaller, so-called ""body shops"" are not legitimate consulting firms but ""sham"" operations that exist to charge fees for visa sponsorship and offer “bench” services to clients while collecting part of the workers’ wages.The H-1B program allows US employers to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations such as technology, engineering, and medicine. While widely used by major employers, the program has long drawn criticism from labor advocates and immigration skeptics who argue it can be exploited to undercut domestic wages or replace US workers. Texas ranks second only to California in the number of H-1B approvals, heightening the local political and economic stakes.Paxton’s move follows an executive directive issued by Governor Greg Abbott one day earlier, ordering state agencies and public higher education institutions to freeze new H-1B visa petitions until May 31, 2027. Affected agencies must report details on current visa holders to the Texas Workforce Commission by March 27, including job roles, countries of origin, visa expiration dates, and efforts to recruit Texans first.The state actions mirror heightened federal scrutiny of the program. In September 2025, US Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Department of Labor launched coordinated fraud investigations, including the Labor Department’s “Project Firewall,” aimed at ensuring employers prioritize American workers and comply with wage and recruitment rules.While framed as an enforcement effort, Paxton’s investigation also unfolds against the backdrop of his Senate campaign. Paxton is challenging John Cornyn, a four-term senator and former GOP whip, in the March 3, 2026, Republican primary. Paxton has cast himself as a hardline conservative aligned with “America First” priorities, repeatedly criticizing Cornyn as too moderate on issues such as US aid to Ukraine and immigration.Recent polling shows Paxton and Cornyn effectively tied, and with a third candidate, Congressman Wesley Hunt also in the field, there is the possibility of a May runoff if no candidate gets 50 per cent vote. President Trump is yet to weigh in on the race.Taken together, the investigation and the Senate race underscore a broader struggle within the Texas Republican Party between MAGA-aligned insurgents and more traditional conservatives. The outcome could shape not only the party’s direction on immigration policy, but also Texas’s influence in national debates over labor, work visas, enforcement, and economic growth.","Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced a sweeping investigation into alleged abuse of the federal H-1B visa program.

US warns its citizens on B’desh ‘violence’





Dhaka: Days after India advised family members of its diplomats and officials to return amid threats of violence and Dhaka shrugged it off saying “it’s their choice” and “not our concern”, the US embassy in Bangladesh on Friday issued a “security alert” for its citizens, cautioning them of “political violence or extremist attacks”.“Bangladesh will hold parliamentary elections and a national referendum simultaneously on Feb 12. During the election period, political violence or extremist attacks may occur potentially targeting rallies, polling stations, and religious sites such as churches, temples, mosques, and other places of religious significance,” the embassy said.The alert came even as the Muhammad Yunus-headed interim govt said the atmosphere in the country is suitable to hold “peaceful and free and fair”. Pre-pollviolence leading to deaths and attacks on minorities and their institutions, including killings, arson and land grabbing, have blunted govt’s “all is well” claim, with rights body reporting 42 incidents of communal violence, including 11 killings and a rape, in Jan.The embassy said, “US citizens should practise vigilance and remember demonstrations or rallies intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.You should exercise caution in the vicinity of any large gatherings.”On Dec 15 too, the US embassy had issued a “security alert” for its citizens, days after radical leader and India baiter Sharif Osman Hadi was shot in the head in Dhaka. He died on Dec 18, following which widespread mob-violence and anti-India protests rocked Bangladesh.US embassy in Bangladesh issued an alert for its citizens, cautioning them of “political violence or extremist attacks” ahead of the Feb 12 polls, days after India had advised the kin of its diplomatic staff to return.","US embassy in Bangladesh issued a ‘security alert’ for its citizens, cautioning them of ‘political violence or extremist attacks’ Days after India advised family members of its diplomats and officials to return amid threats of violence, Dhaka shrugged it off saying “it’s their choice’ and “not our concern”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127812774,imgsize-9282,width-400,resizemode-4/istockphoto-1874014426-612x612.jpg"

Trump, Schumer Talks ‘FAIL’; Dems Refuse GOP Spending Bill Over ICE, DHS





The Senate passed a compromise spending package Friday in a 71-29 vote, clearing a path for Congress to avert a lengthy government shutdown.The vote came a day after Senate Democrats and President Donald Trump struck a deal to attach two weeks of Homeland Security funding to five spending bills that will fund the Pentagon, State Department and many other agencies until September 30, Politico reported.Only five of 53 Republicans voted against it after Trump publicly urged lawmakers Thursday to approve the legislation. Democrats were split, with 24 of 47 caucus members opposing the package.The Senate’s vote did not avert a partial shutdown that will start early Saturday morning since House lawmakers were out of town and not scheduled to return until Monday.During a private call with House Republicans Friday, Speaker Mike Johnson said the likeliest route to House passage would be bringing the package up under a fast-track process Monday evening. That would require a two-thirds majority and a significant number of Democratic votes.The Rs 99.6 lakh crore package could face challenges in the House, especially from conservative hard-liners who said they would vote against any Senate changes to what the House already passed. Many House Democrats were also wary of stopgap funding for DHS, which would keep ICE and Border Patrol funded at current levels without immediate new restrictions.Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he had been in constant contact with Johnson “for better or worse” about getting the funding deal through the House, predicting that the Louisiana Republican was “prepared to do everything he can as quickly as possible.”“Hopefully things go well over there,” he added.If the Trump-blessed deal ultimately got signed into law, Congress would have approved more than 95 percent of federal funding, leaving only a full-year DHS bill on its to-do list. Congress already funded several agencies, including the departments of Agriculture, Veterans Affairs and Justice.“These are fiscally responsible bills that reflect months of hard work and deliberation from members on both parties and both sides of the Capitol,” Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) said before the final vote.The Office of Management and Budget issued shutdown guidance for agencies not already funded, which included furloughs of some personnel.Republicans agreeing to strip out the full-year DHS bill and replace it with a two-week patch was a major win for Democrats. They quickly unified behind a demand to split off and renegotiate immigration enforcement funding after federal agents deployed to Minnesota fatally shot 37-year-old U.S. citizen Alex Pretti last week.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who helped negotiate the final deal, took a victory lap after the vote, saying “the agreement we reached today did exactly what Democrats wanted.”But Democrats still needed to negotiate with the White House and congressional Republicans about what, if any, policy changes they were willing to codify into law as part of a long-term bill. Republicans were open to some changes, including requiring independent investigations. But they already dismissed some of Democrats’ main demands, including requiring judicial warrants for immigration arrests.","The Senate passed a compromise spending package Friday in a 71-29 vote, clearing a path for Congress to avert a lengthy government shutdown. The vote came a day after Senate Democrats and President Donald Trump struck a deal to attach two weeks of Homeland Security funding to five spending bills. Only five of 53 Republicans voted against it.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127812734,imgsize-44848,width-400,resizemode-4/us-government-shutdown-ap-image.jpg"
Senate scrambles to save funding deal as US govt shutdown looms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/senate-scrambles-to-save-funding-deal-as-us-govt-shutdown-looms/articleshow/127812739.cms,".





Senate leaders were scrambling on Friday to save a bipartisan spending deal and prevent a partial govt shutdown this weekend as some Republicans pushed back on a rare deal between President Trump and Democrats.Democrats who are demanding new restrictions on federal immigration raids across the country struck an agreement with Trump on Thursday to separate funding for the department of homeland security from a broad govt spending bill and give Congress two weeks to debate the issue. That agreement came after Democrats threatened to block the entire spending bill and trigger a shutdown in the wake of the deaths of two protesters at the hands of federal agents in Minneapolis.Trump said he didn’t want a shutdown and encouraged members of both parties to cast a “much needed Bipartisan ‘YES’ vote.” But passage of the deal was delayed as some senators pushed back, warning Republicans should not give away too much leverage on the border issue. Senator Lindsey Graham said he would hold up the deal unless Republican leaders gave him a vote on his bill preventing local govts from resisting immigration policies.Graham has also opposed House language repealing a new law that gives senators the ability to sue govt if their data is accessed without their knowledge. Senate majority leader John Thune said there were “snags on both sides” as he and Democratic leader Chuck Schumer tried to work through any objections. Schumer said Friday “time is of the essence” and “abuses of ICE have to come to an end”.Even if the Senate passes the funding measure, it would need House approval before becoming law. The House is not expected to return until Monday, raising the possibility of at least a temporary partial shutdown.","Senate leaders are scrambling to save a bipartisan spending deal and prevent a partial govt shutdown this weekend.

President Donald Trump’s administration will add some 65,000 H-2B seasonal guest worker visas through September 30, a Federal Register notice said, stating the visas would be available to employers at risk of severe financial hardship due to a lack of US labour, Reuters reported.The move roughly doubled the 66,000 visas available each year to businesses such as construction, hospitality, landscaping and seafood processing, in a recognition that US employers in those industries could be struggling to find workers.A temporary rule making the additional H-2B visas available will be formally published in the Federal Register on Tuesday, the notice said.Trump, a Republican, launched a wide-ranging immigration crackdown after returning to the White House in 2025, portraying immigrants without legal status as criminals and a drain on their communities. His administration also clamped down on forms of legal immigration, with broad travel bans and reviews of refugee and asylum cases.The number of available visas also was expanded under former President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and Trump during periods of his 2017-2021 presidency.Employers in the seasonal businesses, including hotels, clamoured for more visas. Some construction businesses complained of a lack of workers during Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown.Groups that favour lower levels of immigration opposed the visas, saying they undercut wages for US workers.Trump made it harder for tech businesses to obtain workers through the H-1B programme, tacking on a $100,000 fee that triggered a legal challenge.","President Donald Trump’s administration will add some 65,000 H-2B seasonal guest worker visas through September 30.

DOJ Releases Millions Of Epstein Files As Emails Make Bombshell Claims About Bill Gates | WATCH





US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who once said that he avoided being in one room with Jeffrey Epstein , had planned a trip to his private island, according to documents that the Justice Department released on Friday.The planned visit in 2012 came years after Lutnick had said he severed ties with Epstein.In December 2012, the records show, Lutnick sent an email to Epstein saying that he had a group of people including his wife and children and another family who were visiting the Caribbean. He asked where Epstein was located and whether they could visit for a meal, New York Times reported.Epstein replied through an assistant to give more information about the location of Little St. James, his private island off the coast of St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands. They eventually settled on plans for a lunch gathering.Prominent people who were close to Epstein have been scrutinised in recent years for their visits to Little St. James, but Lutnick’s planned visit had not been previously disclosed. Reached by phone on Friday, Lutnick said he could not comment about the island visit because he had not seen the latest Epstein documents.“I spent zero time with him,” Lutnick said. He then hung up.The documents suggest the visit did occur. The gathering was set for Dec. 23, 2012. A day later, an assistant to Epstein forwarded Lutnick a message from Epstein: “Nice seeing you,” it said.In a podcast interview last year, Lutnick claimed that around 2005, he and his wife had been so revolted by Epstein that they decided not to associate with him again.Lutnick said in the interview that Epstein invited them to tour his Upper East Side mansion, next door to Lutnick’s own home. When they noticed a massage table in the middle of a room, Lutnick recalled, Epstein explained that he received “the right kind of massage” every day. Lutnick said that he and his wife quickly left and decided to “never be in a room with that disgusting person ever again.”“So I was never in the room with him socially, for business, or even philanthropy,” Lutnick said in the interview with Pod Force One. “If that guy was there, I wasn’t going, because he’s gross.”Before they connected in December 2012, an assistant to Epstein had reached out to Lutnick. “Jeffrey requested I please pass along some phone numbers to you so the two of you can possibly get together,” the assistant wrote the month before.Lutnick planned the Caribbean excursion along with his wife, Allison. She explained in an email that they would be arriving on a 188-foot yacht called “Excellence.”The documents show that Lutnick and Epstein’s lives continued to overlap in more recent years. In 2017, Epstein contributed to a charity dinner honouring Lutnick. In 2018, they exchanged emails that appear to discuss them joining forces to battle construction plans by The Frick Collection, a museum across the street from both of their homes.","US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick had planned a trip to Jeffrey Epstein's private island, according to documents that the Justice Department released on Friday.

Protests against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown spread across the United States on Friday, with organisers calling for a nationwide strike under the slogan “no work, no school, no shopping”.The protests were driven by anger over recent fatal shootings linked to immigration enforcement.

Tech billionaire Elon Musk seemed to want to visit disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein ’s Caribbean island, documents released by the Justice Department on Friday showed.Musk previously claimed that he rebuffed attempts from Epstein to get him to visit one of the two islands Epstein owned, Great St. James and Little St. James, in the US Virgin Islands, near the British Virgin Islands. Little St. James was an epicentre of Epstein’s decades-long abuse of girls and young women.On December 13, 2013, Musk emailed Epstein: “Will be in the BVI/St Bart’s area over the holidays. Is there a good time to visit?”Epstein responded two days later and said the beginning of the new year would be good, adding: “always space for you.” On Christmas Day, Epstein said in another email: “the 2 or 3 would be perfect. I will come and get you.”Musk first responded that he needed to fly back to Los Angeles on the night of January 2, before saying he could push his departure back a day.“When should we head to your island on the 2nd?” Musk asked Epstein.It was not clear from the emails whether Musk ultimately visited. The emails showed a level of communication between the pair that had not been previously revealed and came despite Musk’s attempts to denigrate his opponents by trying to tie them to Epstein.During their explosive feud last year, Musk suggested that President Donald Trump slowed the rollout of the Epstein files because the President’s name was in them. That was part of the breakdown between the President and a man who was one of his closest advisers, CNN reported.",Elon Musk emailed Jeffrey Epstein asking when he could visit his Caribbean island.
