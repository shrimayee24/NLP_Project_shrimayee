Poll Should authorities enhance public awareness about fake medical practitioners? Not really Absolutely

BHOPAL: Authorities in Madhya Pradesh are investigating allegations that a man hired by a missionary hospital in Damoh district as a 'highly skilled cardiologist' from the UK was a fraud, whose surgeries killed anywhere from seven to a dozen people in less than a month.The suspect, whose real name could be Narendra Vikramaditya Yadav, allegedly posed as UK doctor N John Kem. It is alleged that the hospital hired him although he didn't possess valid medical qualifications or professional credentials.He is accused of performing risky heart surgeries on unsuspecting patients, many of whom died shortly after undergoing the procedures. Local authorities fear that the actual number of victims could be higher.Neither collector Sudhir Kocher nor Damoh chief medical and health officer Dr Mukesh Jain could be contacted for their versions despite multiple attempts. The suspect has gone missing after the complaint.Deepak Tiwari, district president of the Child Welfare Committee, who raised the matter, said that several families alerted the administration after they noticed discrepancies in Yadav's qualifications and credentials. Some patients, who were sceptical of the doctor's expertise, took their relatives to a different hospital in Jabalpur, where it was discovered that Yadav was impersonating a foreign-trained cardiologist.""I came to know that the internal report submitted to the collector has referred to casualties of seven patients who were operated on by the quack, but we think the toll must be around 12,"" Tiwari told TOI.It is also alleged that Yadav has a criminal case against him in Hyderabad and had failed to provide any legitimate identification or medical certificates when questioned.Priyank Kanungo, a member of National Human Rights Commission, posted it on social media and said that the hospital is associated with Prime Minister Ayushman Yojana. In this way, govt money has also been misused, he said.","Suspect, whose real name could be Narendra Vikramaditya Yadav, allegedly posed as UK doctor N John Kem.

KALYAN: Two weeks after a 60-year-old woman was killed in Kalyan, a 30-year-old man, Chand Sheikh alias Akbar, has been arrested in the case eight months after he was released from jail in another murder case.The police said that he had entered the house of Ranjana Patekar, to ask for water. He allegedly killed the woman after raising the volume of the TV set in her house and fled with her gold. Sheikh, a resident of Ambivali near Kalyan, has confessed to the crime, the police said.The police found out that the man had, in 2014, killed another woman also from Kalyan in a similar manner when he worked as a gas cylinder delivery boy. Sheikh and another delivery boy had been convicted for life, but he had been released from jail eight months ago for ‘good behaviour'.In the latest case, the police had initially arrested the neighbour of the deceased woman after the dead woman's family had expressed suspicion on the neighbour. The police said they continued to probe the case as they were ""convinced that the neighbour was innocent"".According to officials of Khadakpada police station, on the day of the crime (Mar 20), Patekar was alone in the house. Sheikh, who used to lived nearby would pass by her house frequently, asked her for water. A police official said: ""When she went inside the house to fetch water, he entered the house, toned up the volume of the TV set after which he gagged her and pushed her to the floor and strangled her...He grabbed all the jewellery she was wearing, worth more than Rs 1 lakh.""Deputy commissioner of police Atul Zende of Kalyan zone said that his investigation team learnt that neither had people in the neighbourhood heard any cry for help nor had they seen anyone pass by.

Since the accused earlier lived in Kolsewadi area, and later came to live in this area after being released from jail recently, it took time for the police to reach him.Assistant commissioner Kalyanji Ghete said that Sheikh had not been able to find work after his release from jail.

US Visa News: Anyone who isn't a US citizen should think twice before traveling outside especially if...: Experts warn amid crackdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/anyone-who-isnt-a-us-citizen-should-think-twice-before-traveling-outside-especially-if-experts-warn-amid-crackdown/articleshow/120023858.cms,"Experts feel green card holders should think twice now before traveling outside the US if they have criticized Trump on social media.

Having correct documents is most important

Green card holders and visa holders in the country need to think twice before traveling outside the country, lawyers warn amid the massive crackdown on international students and migrants. ""Anyone who isn't a U.S. citizen should think hard about the need to leave the United States, especially if they have made statements on social media that are critical of political positions that the Trump administration supports or have had even minimal contact with police,"" César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, the Gregory Williams Chair in civil rights & civil liberties at Ohio State University College of Law, told Newsweek.""The Trump administration has given permanent residents and visa holders plenty of reason to worry about running into problems trying to get back into the United States from a trip abroad,"" the immigration law expert said, though the administration asserted that those who have not broken any laws have nothing to fear about anything.Shannon Shepherd, chair of the media committee for the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) told Newsweek that overall there's no guarantee that a person coming back to the US will be granted entry and that's been the case always. ""But what we're seeing lately is more negative exercise of discretion, I guess is the way to put it, where people are being denied entry that we wouldn't necessarily have been denied before or people being detained instead of just allowed to withdraw their request for entry.""According to these experts, having the correct documentation is of utmost importance. For green card holders, the documents are a valid passport and the green card. If the green card is up for renewal, then one must vatty the receipt from the US Citizenship and Immigration Service.Past criminal convictions, even minor infractions, could now be taken into account at the discretion of CBP officers at the border, along with social media comments or text messages, in order to deny entry even if the traveler has all the correct paperwork, Shepherd said.If an individual is in the process of applying for a green card, known as Adjustment of Status (AoS), then they generally can't leave the country without Advance Parole. This is a travel document that has to be granted by USCIS before travel. CBP website mentions that those with valid H-1B or L-1 visas going through AoS are allowed to travel without Advance Parole, as are V- and K-3/4 nonimmigrant visa holders.","Green card holders and visa holders in the country need to think twice before traveling outside the country, lawyers warn.

Jim Cramer predicts 1987 'Black Monday' style stock market crash because of Trump tariffs in viral video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/jim-cramer-predicts-1987-black-monday-style-stock-market-crash-because-of-trump-tariffs-in-viral-video/articleshow/120024490.cms,"Jim Cramer's prediction of 'Black Monday' on live television went viral.

CNBC host Jim Cramer predicted a 1987-like ' Black Monday ' coming week because of the tariffs Donald Trump imposed on countries. ""If the president doesn't try to reach out and reward these countries and companies that play by the rules, then the 1987 scenario...the one where we went down three days and then down 22% on Monday, has the most cogency. We will not have to wait too long to know. We will know it by Monday,"" Cramer said.“It’s tough to build a new, weaker, world order on the fly.

Those who bottom-fished are sleeping with the fishes …so far,' Cramer posted on XThe market blood bath continued for two consecutive days on Thursday and Friday after Trump's tariff announcement on Wednesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted by more than 2,200 points after China unveiled stiff retaliatory taxes to President Trump’s tariffs. The Dow tanked 2,231 points — a day after suffering a 1,679-point drop, its previous worst session since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.On Friday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted by 962.82 points, or 5.8%, while the broad-based S&P 500 was down 322.44 points, or 5.97%.China’s foreign ministry slammed the United States for using tariffs as a weapon for “extreme pressure and self-interest,” saying US “economic bullying will ultimately backfire.” “We do not seek conflict, nor do we fear it. Pressure and threats are not the correct ways to engage with China,” the foreign ministry said in a lengthy statement today.Trump maintained his stance on tariffs and urged Americans to ""hang tough"" as the tariffs are not going to be easy. China and “many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,” Trump said, accusing them of using the United States as a “whipping post,” reiterating his rationale for the tariffs as he has accused other countries of “taking advantage” of the United States.","The market blood bath continued for two consecutive days on Thursday and Friday after Trump's tariff announcement on Wednesday.

Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee: Booed on the steps: How Prince Harry and Meghan faced an icy homecoming at Queen’s Jubilee in 2022,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/booed-on-the-steps-how-prince-harry-and-meghan-faced-an-icy-homecoming-at-queens-jubilee-in-2022/articleshow/120025224.cms,"How Prince Harry and Meghan faced an icy homecoming at Queen’s Jubilee in 2022 (Picture credit: AP)

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s return to the UK for Queen Elizabeth II’s Platinum Jubilee in June 2022 was anything but a warm homecoming. According to Daily Mail, the couple’s appearance at the National Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral was carefully stage-managed by royal aides to avoid awkward interactions with senior royals, especially Prince William.Tensions were still running high after the Sussexes’ explosive 2021 Oprah interview, in which they accused an unnamed royal of making a racist remark and Harry claimed his father, King Charles, had cut him off financially.As per Daily Mail, royal officials were determined to prevent a repeat of the frosty atmosphere from the pair’s last joint appearance with the family at Westminster Abbey in 2020. The seating plan at St Paul’s was therefore designed to place Harry and Meghan far from William, Charles, and the Queen’s close working royals.Although logistical concerns were handled with precision, the Sussexes arrived and left separately from senior royals and were seated on the opposite side of the aisle—the public’s reaction proved less predictable.As Harry and Meghan stepped out of the cathedral, a mix of cheers and boos rang out.According to Daily Mail, it was their first public royal engagement together since stepping back from duties and the jeering signalled how dramatically public sentiment had shifted.Royal correspondents, including Sky’s Kay Burley and Rhiannon Mills described the crowd’s response as “mixed,” though others, such as MailOnline’s reporter on the scene, said cheering for William and Kate was the “biggest of the day by some margin.” AFP footage also captured audible boos as the couple exited.Inside the cathedral, their second-row placement, behind non-working royals, underscored their diminished status. Charles and Camilla, representing the Queen, were seated prominently in the front row alongside William and Kate. Meanwhile, Harry and Meghan were seated between Lady Chatto and Princess Eugenie’s husband, Jack Brooksbank. There was no visible interaction between the brothers, highlighting the depth of their rift.According to Daily Mail, a palace source described the seating as “a typically elegant solution,” explaining, “The Queen wants her family there and they are still part of it. But in a carefully controlled fashion.”The day also offered no sign of the Netflix crews that had followed the couple during previous engagements, a relief to royal courtiers wary of media exploitation. Yet tensions lingered over privacy.The Sun reported at the time that Harry and Meghan were denied permission to bring a personal photographer when introducing their daughter Lilibet to the Queen, due to fears the image might be leaked to US media.Later, the Sussexes left for Frogmore Cottage and skipped a royal reception. For Harry, who once topped polls as Britain’s most popular royal, the experience marked a fall from grace.As per Daily Mail, he once symbolised the perfect modern prince, charming, brave and down-to-earth. But the 2022 jubilee underscored how much that image had changed.The couple have since remained largely in California, with no sign of reconciliation with the royal family or of a turnaround in public opinion. For Harry, the once-familiar cheers have been replaced by boos, and it remains to be seen whether that distance, both literal and emotional, will ever be bridged.","Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's return to the UK for Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee in June 2022 was anything but a warm homecoming.

Trans college student arrested in Florida Capitol for defying bathroom law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trans-college-student-arrested-in-florida-capitol-for-defying-bathroom-law/articleshow/120031096.cms,"Photo credit: AP

In what civil rights advocates say could be the first criminal case of its kind, a transgender college student was arrested at the Florida State Capitol last month after entering a women’s restroom — an act she described as intentional defiance of the state’s restrictive new laws.Marcy Rheintgen , 20, declared “I am here to break the law” before entering the restroom on March 19 in Tallahassee. Capitol police, who had reportedly been notified ahead of time, were waiting. Officers initially warned her that she would be issued a trespass citation, but when she declined to leave after washing her hands and praying the rosary, she was taken into custody.The Illinois native now faces a misdemeanor trespass charge, which carries a potential sentence of up to 60 days in jail. Her court appearance is scheduled for May.“I wanted people to see the absurdity of this law in practice,” Rheintgen said. “If I’m a criminal, it’s going to be so hard for me to live a normal life, all because I washed my hands. Like, that’s so insane.”Her arrest has prompted significant attention from legal groups and civil rights organizations, many of whom believe this could be a landmark test of criminal bathroom restrictions that have passed in Republican-led states across the country. While more than a dozen states have enacted such laws, only Florida and Utah have provisions that make violations a criminal offense.According to Jon Davidson, senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, Rheintgen’s case is the first arrest they’re aware of under any of these criminal statutes.Rheintgen’s visit to the Capitol was driven by a personal protest. She was visiting family in the area when she decided to write and deliver a letter to all 160 members of Florida’s legislature. In the letter, she informed lawmakers of her intention to use a restroom inconsistent with the sex assigned to her at birth — a deliberate act of civil disobedience.“I know that you know in your heart that this law is wrong and unjust,” she wrote. “I know that you know in your heart that transgender people are human too, and that you can’t arrest us away. I know that you know that I have dignity. That’s why I know that you won’t arrest me.”Transgender advocates say these laws — now on the books in states like Alabama, Kentucky, Kansas, and North Dakota — are legally murky and largely unenforceable. Most rely on citizen complaints rather than state action. In Utah, activists have overwhelmed the state’s official reporting system with false reports to protect transgender individuals from investigation.The arrest has heightened concerns about the practical enforcement of such legislation, particularly with regard to the potential consequences for trans individuals. Rheintgen, for example, fears that if convicted, she could be incarcerated with male inmates, be forced to cut her long hair, and temporarily lose access to hormone treatment.“People are telling me it’s a legal test, like this is the first case that’s being brought,” she said. “It’s how they test the law. But I didn’t do this to test the law. I did it because I was upset. I can’t have any expectations for what’s going to happen because this has never been prosecuted before. I’m horrified and scared.”LGBTQ+ organizations have strongly condemned the arrest, with Nadine Smith, executive director of Equality Florida, calling it “about cruelty, humiliation and the deliberate erosion of human dignity.”“The arrest of Marcy Rheintgen is not about safety,” Smith added. “Transgender people have been using restrooms aligned with their gender for generations without incident. What’s changed is not their presence — it’s a wave of laws designed to intimidate them out of public life.”Despite requests for comment, Republican lawmakers behind the Florida legislation — Representative Rachel Plakon and Senator Erin Grall — have not publicly responded to inquiries. In earlier statements, they’ve argued the law is necessary to safeguard women and girls in single-sex spaces.As legal experts watch the case unfold, it may soon shape the national conversation around how far such laws can go — and at what cost.","Marcy Rheintgen, 20, entered the women's restroom at the Florida State Capitol in Tallahassee on March 19.

Border inspectors accused of aiding traffickers at America’s busiest land crossing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/border-inspectors-accused-of-aiding-traffickers-at-americas-busiest-land-crossing/articleshow/120030062.cms,"Two US customs and border protection officers have been charged with accepting thousands of dollars in bribes to allow undocumented migrants into the United States without proper checks.Farlis Almonte and Ricardo Rodriguez were both stationed at the country’s busiest land crossing, assigned to immigration inspection booths at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in Southern California. The officers allegedly worked with human traffickers in Mexico to illegally wave through vehicles packed with undocumented individuals, according to federal prosecutors.The duo was charged after investigators uncovered text messages between the officers and known traffickers, alongside unexplained cash deposits into their personal bank accounts. Surveillance footage showed at least one instance where a vehicle carrying two people was stopped, but only the driver was recorded as entering the country.Prosecutors claimed that both officers accepted thousands of dollars per vehicle they let through. Over time, the pair are believed to have helped dozens of migrants cross into the US without documentation, CBS news reported.The charges stem from an investigation that began last year after three arrested migrant smugglers named Almonte and Rodriguez as collaborators. While Almonte was in custody, investigators reportedly seized nearly $70,000 in cash they believe his partner was attempting to move into Tijuana. He could now face additional charges for money laundering and obstruction of justice.Ricardo Rodriguez’s lawyer, Michael Hawkins, said the case was still in its early stages and reminded the public that his client remains innocent until proven guilty.“We look forward to working through the current situation,” Hawkins said in an email, describing Rodriguez as “hardworking and loyal”.It is yet unclear if Almonte has an attorney to represent him.Acting US attorney Andrew Haden condemned the alleged actions, “any customs and border protection agent who aids or turns a blind eye to smugglers bringing undocumented immigrants into the US is betraying their oath and endangering our national security.”This case marks the latest in a string of corruption scandals involving border officers in the San Diego area. Over the past two years, five officers have faced similar charges.In another case last year, former inspector Leonard Darnell George was sentenced to 23 years in prison after accepting bribes to allow undocumented migrants and drug-laden vehicles through the same San Ysidro crossing.",Farlis Almonte and Ricardo Rodriguez were both stationed at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in Southern California.

Poll In your opinion, how effective is public criticism from leaders like Zelenskyy? Not effective Somewhat effective Very effective

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy launched a scathing attack on US, calling it a ""strong"" country that reacts weakly to Russia's assault.Zelenskyy's statement came after Moscow's missile strike in Ukraine that killed 18 people, including nine children, in his hometown of Kryvyi Rih.The attack occurred on Friday when a Russian ballistic missile struck a residential neighbourhood in the central Ukrainian city. According to Zelenskyy, 62 people were injured in the strike.Taking to social media on Saturday, Zelenskyy expressed his disappointment with the US Embassy's reaction. ""Such a strong country, such a strong people -- and such a weak reaction,"" he wrote. ""They are even afraid to say the word 'Russian' when talking about the missile that killed the children.""US ambassador Bridget Brink had posted on X shortly after the attack, before the full casualty toll was known. ""Horrified that tonight a ballistic missile struck near a playground and restaurant in (Kryvyi Rig). More than 50 people injured and 16 killed, including 6 children. This is why the war must end.""Brink's statement did not mention Russia by name, drawing criticism from social media users and prompting Zelenskyy's rebuke. Many online commenters questioned why the embassy failed to attribute the attack to Moscow.Brink, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden and has served as ambassador since May 2022, has in recent weeks avoided directly naming Russia in her public comments on attacks in Ukraine. This marks a shift from her earlier messaging, which regularly called out Moscow for its aggression.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy takes to social media to criticise the US.

Two British female MPs from the Labour Party were detained and denied entry by Israeli authorities on Saturday, accused of spreading anti-Israel rhetoric and attempting to document the activities of security forces, sparking a diplomatic row between London and Tel Aviv.The MPs, Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed, were part of an official parliamentary delegation when they flew into Israel from Luton Airport. Both were turned back shortly after arrival, with Israeli immigration authorities accusing them of intending “to document the activities of security forces and spread anti-Israel hatred,” according to a report by Sky News.The MPs have not confirmed these claims. Yang represents Earley and Woodley, while Mohamed is the MP for Sheffield Central.British foreign secretary David Lammy described the treatment of the MPs as “unacceptable, counterproductive, and deeply concerning.”“I have made clear to my counterparts in the Israeli government that this is no way to treat British parliamentarians, and we have been in contact with both MPs tonight to offer our support,” Lammy said in a statement on Saturday.He added, “The UK government’s focus remains securing a return to the ceasefire and negotiations to stop the bloodshed, free the hostages and end the conflict in Gaza.”The detention and deportation of Yang and Mohamed have raised fresh questions about Israel’s stance towards foreign lawmakers, especially amid ongoing criticism of its military actions in Gaza.Israeli forces resumed full-scale operations last month following the collapse of a brief truce with Hamas. Since then, the health ministry in Gaza says at least 1,249 people have been killed in renewed strikes. This brings the total number of Palestinian deaths since the conflict began to over 50,000.The war began after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to official Israeli figures reported by AFP.The exact reason for the MPs’ visit is still unclear, but Israeli officials said the two planned to watch and film security forces.","Two female MPs from the Labour Party were denied entry to Israel on Saturday.

LIVE: Tornado Watch issued for much of Southeast Texas until 9 p.m.

Heavy rainfall and flash flooding struck the South and Midwest on Saturday, affecting regions already saturated from previous severe storms and tornadoes, bringing the death toll to 16 and causing extensive damage to infrastructure.Continuous downpours across the central United States have led to rapid water level increases and multiple flash flood emergencies from Texas to Ohio. The National Weather Service anticipated numerous locations across multiple states would reach ""major flood stage,"" potentially causing substantial damage to infrastructure.Since Wednesday, rainfall exceeded 12 inches (30.5 centimetres) in parts of Kentucky and 8 inches (20 centimetres) in Arkansas and Missouri regions. Weather experts attributed the conditions to warm temperatures, atmospheric instability, wind shear and Gulf moisture.In Louisville, Mayor Craig Greenberg reported the Ohio River rose 5 feet (about 1.5 metres) within 24 hours. Flash flood warnings persisted across Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky. Kentucky faced widespread road closures due to floods and debris.Hopkinsville, Kentucky, experienced temporary relief as floodwaters receded. Falmouth, a town of 2,000 residents, faced mandatory evacuation due to the rising Licking River. Arkansas officials urged residents to limit travel, while BNSF Railway reported a bridge washout in Mammoth Spring.The death toll from weather-related incidents has reached 16, including 10 in Tennessee. In Missouri, a 57-year-old man perished after exiting a vehicle swept off the road. Kentucky reported two casualties: a 9-year-old boy and a 74-year-old person found in a submerged vehicle. In Little Rock, Arkansas, a 5-year-old died in a weather-related incident. Earlier tornadoes caused seven fatalities and destroyed neighbourhoods.According to AccuWeather's chief meteorologist Jonathan Porter, the extensive flooding near major cargo centres in Louisville, Kentucky, and Memphis could disrupt shipping operations.Nearly half of NWS forecast offices currently face 20% vacancy rates following Trump administration cuts, double the rate from ten years ago.Experts indicated that river levels would continue to rise for several days.","Heavy rainfall and flash flooding struck the South and Midwest on Saturday, affecting regions already saturated from previous severe storms and tornadoes.

Trump administration pushes back against court order to return man mistakenly deported to El Salvador,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-pushes-back-against-court-order-to-return-man-mistakenly-deported-to-el-salvador/articleshow/120029021.cms,"In this undated photo provided by the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, a man identified by Jennifer Vasquez Sura as her husband, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, is led by force by guards through the Terrorism Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador. (AP photo)

The Trump administration has asked a federal appeals court to halt a judge’s order that directed the US government to return a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador — a country where he now sits in a notorious prison. The US Justice Department argued Saturday that the judiciary lacks the authority to compel the executive branch to engage with foreign governments in such matters.“A judicial order that forces the Executive to engage with a foreign power in a certain way, let alone compel a certain action by a foreign sovereign, is constitutionally intolerable,” the administration said in a filing to the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals.The filing came a day after US District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the administration to “facilitate and effectuate” the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia by Monday night. The appeals court has asked Abrego Garcia’s attorneys to respond by Sunday.Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Salvadoran national, was wrongly deported last month despite a 2019 immigration judge’s ruling protecting him from removal. He now remains detained in a prison in El Salvador known for severe human rights violations . The White House described the deportation as an “administrative error.”Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni, who admitted in court on Friday that Abrego Garcia’s deportation was a mistake, has since been placed on leave. “At my direction, every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States. Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.During the hearing, Reuveni told the judge, “I’m also frustrated that I have no answers for you for a lot of these questions,” and could not clarify the legal basis for Abrego Garcia’s arrest.Judge Xinis, appointed by former President Barack Obama, ruled there was no legal justification for Abrego Garcia’s arrest or removal. His attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, criticised the government’s inaction, saying: “Plenty of tweets. Plenty of White House press conferences. But no actual steps taken with the government of El Salvador to make it right.”The White House has insisted Abrego Garcia is affiliated with the MS-13 gang, a claim his lawyers deny, asserting there is no evidence supporting that accusation. They maintain that Abrego Garcia had legal work authorization in the US , was employed as a sheet metal apprentice, and lived with his US citizen wife. He originally fled El Salvador in 2011 due to threats from gangs.In its filing, the Justice Department claimed it has no power to compel El Salvador to return Abrego Garcia, comparing the court order to demands for resolving international conflicts: “It is an injunction to force a foreign sovereign to send back a foreign terrorist within three days’ time. That is no way to run a government. And it has no basis in American law.”","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 29, was wrongly deported last month despite a 2019 immigration judge’s ruling protecting him from removal.

Canada has again updated its travel advisory for the United States, including a warning to prospective travelers that they should be prepared for scrutiny from border patrol officers. The updated advisory says US authorities can check electronic devices like phones and laptops. ""Comply and be forthcoming in all interactions with border authorities. If you are denied entry. you could be detained while awaiting deportation,"" the new advice read.This is the second major update of Canada's travel rules for the US. The first came as the US made it mandatory for all Canadians staying in the US for more than 30 days to register with the US administration. This new rule is effective from April 11.The mandatory registration rules come from an executive order issued by President Donald Trump on his first day in office, directing the Department of Homeland Security to ensure non-citizens comply with the Immigration and Nationality Act. The law requires “all aliens 14 years of age or older who were not registered and fingerprinted (if required) when applying for a US visa and who remain in the United States for 30 days or longer” to do so, according to the USCIS website. Parents and legal guardians of children under 14 must make sure they are registered.Canada issued a warning about the stricter border checks before the new rule took effect.""Individual border agents often have significant discretion in making those determinations. US authorities strictly enforce entry requirements. Expect scrutiny at ports of entry, including of electronic devices. Comply and be forthcoming in all interactions with border authorities.

"Elon Musk's Doge falsely brands feminine hygiene research as transgender study, cancels $600,000 grant",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musks-doge-falsely-brands-hygiene-research-as-transgender-study-cancels-600000-grant/articleshow/120029655.cms,"Elon Musk (L), Representative AI image by Denny (R)

A $600,000 federal grant awarded to Southern University for researching sustainable feminine hygiene products has been abruptly canceled after US officials misrepresented it as a study on "" menstrual cycles in transgender men ."" The misinformation, amplified by the Department of Government Efficiency ( Doge ) on its website and on X, has triggered safety fears for the lead researcher and backlash from the scientific and farming communities.The grant, titled Project Farm to Feminine Hygiene, was designed to explore alternatives to synthetic menstrual products using natural fibers like regenerative cotton. It also included educational outreach for women and girls and plans to establish a local fiber-processing facility.But Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins revoked the funding last month, incorrectly framing the project as focused on transgender menstruation. “The real loss is for women,” said Sharon Donnan, founder of Acadian Brown Cotton, a key partner in the project. “It makes me so angry that I want to start calling names.”Doge , led by President Donald Trump ’s advisor Elon Musk, is spearheading sweeping cost-cutting efforts across the federal government. While the department claims to be eliminating wasteful spending, critics say it's increasingly targeting programs based on distorted or outright false narratives.“This was just one more senseless, hateful cancellation,” said a representative of Acadian Brown Cotton, who requested anonymity due to safety concernsAccording to the US Department of Agriculture and five sources interviewed by AFP, the grant mentioned the word “transgender” only once—in a single line acknowledging that some transgender men may menstruate. Southern University issued a statement clarifying that the project “was not a study on or including research on menstrual cycles.”Despite that, Rollins repeated the false narrative during a White House Cabinet meeting, while Doge promoted it online. The misleading claim fueled online outrage so intense that the project’s lead researcher, Samii Kennedy Benson, feared for her safety, sources said.""This grant would have expanded the market,” said a cotton farmer who contributed to the study. “It's kind of sad it got cut off in the middle.”Southern University, a historically Black college, also aimed to support local cotton growers in Louisiana—one of the nation’s poorest states. Norris Green Jr., a Black farmer excited to contribute to the project, urged federal officials to witness the impact of their decisions firsthand. “Come to the Gulf and see how many of these females are impoverished,” he said. “You might have a different perspective.”The incident is part of a broader pattern tied to Doge ’s controversial agenda. The agency has come under scrutiny for spreading falsehoods about various federal programs—ranging from fabricated claims about government-funded transgender mice to condoms supposedly sent to war-torn Gaza.""Most factual information about Doge either never makes it in front of the people who need it most or is received with hostility,"" said Audrey McCabe, an analyst with the nonprofit Common Cause. “Once a falsehood infiltrates public consciousness, an investigation correcting the lie can only do so much to cancel it out.”Doge 's website, which promotes its cost-saving efforts, has been flagged by media reports as being riddled with inaccuracies. Despite mounting criticism, officials have continued to promote dubious narratives—many of which receive millions of views online.The Biden administration has not commented on the specific cancellation, and Benson has not responded to interview requests.","$600,000 federal grant awarded to Southern University for researching sustainable feminine hygiene products has been abruptly canceled.

A protestor dressed as Pikachu was spotted in the crowds as a surge of protests erupted across the US on Saturday after thousands of demonstrators filled the streets across all 50 states to voice their opposition to President Donald Trump and his key adviser Elon Musk.The coordinated wave of over 1,200 “Hands Off!” rallies united a broad coalition — including civil rights groups , labor unions, LGBTQ+ advocates, veterans, and other community organizations — in pushing back against the administration’s drastic cuts to public services , government downsizing, and contentious social policy shifts.The administration is facing fierce backlash from critics who say it’s dismantling the foundations of American democracy. ""They’ve woken up a sleeping giant, and they haven’t seen nothing yet,"" declared activist Graylan Hagler during a protest in Washington, D.C., as reported by AFP.Elon Musk — the billionaire head of Tesla, SpaceX, and social platform X — is at the center of the storm as the newly appointed chief of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a role that has seen him push sweeping budget cuts across federal institutions.While Musk insists the reforms are saving taxpayers billions, many see them as a dangerous erosion of vital public services. Protesters, according to the Associated Press, condemned the closure of Social Security offices, large-scale layoffs of federal employees, and looming reductions in healthcare and HIV-related programs.At the Washington rally, Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, slammed the administration’s rollback of LGBTQ+ protections: “They’re trying to ban our books, they’re slashing HIV prevention funding, they’re criminalizing our doctors, our teachers, our families and our lives,” she said.These frustrations resonated across the country. In New York, crowds marched through Manhattan holding signs with messages like “Hands Off Our Democracy” and “Diversity Equity Inclusion Makes America Strong.”","Over 1,200 ""Hands Off!"" rallies took place across the US on Saturday.

A shocking incident at a West Virginia cemetery has led to the arrest of a gravedigger after he allegedly desecrated the remains of an infant buried more than four decades ago. Authorities say the man carelessly disposed of the child’s casket, leading to the remains being flung from the coffin.The disturbing episode unfolded on March 27 at Baylous Cemetery in Salt Rock, where 49-year-old Matthew Fortner was digging a grave for a new burial plot. During the process, he allegedly struck and unearthed a small casket interred in 1982, according to the Cabell County Sheriff ’s Office.Rather than treating the discovery with the respect and care required, officials say Fortner heartlessly tossed the casket down a nearby hillside. As it tumbled down the slope, the lid flew open, sending the skeletal remains of the baby into the air.The horrifying scene was witnessed by a couple who were visitinUg the cemetery to decorate graves ahead of Easter. Disturbed by what they saw, they promptly notified local authorities.“It takes a sick individual, in my opinion, to desecrate a grave and mess with a corpse — period,” said Cabell County Sheriff Doug Adams, expressing disgust over the act.Fortner was arrested on April 3 and is now facing several charges, including disinterment or displacement of a dead body, damaging cemetery property, and violating laws protecting human skeletal remains. He is currently being held on a $105,000 bond and, if convicted, could face up to five years in prison.Sheriff’s officials emphasized that only one grave — that of the infant, believed to be just a few months old at the time of burial — appeared to have been disturbed. The identity of the child has not been disclosed.“We do think this is an isolated incident. We don’t think this is going to be a trend or anything,” Sheriff Adams reassured the public.Following the incident, the child’s remains were transported to the State Medical Examiner’s Office in Charleston for examination.Adding a grim dimension to the story, Fortner has a previous criminal history. In 1997, he was convicted of murder and sentenced to life with mercy two years later. He was released from prison in 2008.Authorities continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident.","Matthew Fortner, 49, was digging a grave at Baylous Cemetery in Salt Rock, West Virginia, when he allegedly struck and unearthed a small casket interred in 1982.

‘MAKE A DEAL,’ Trump sends letter to Iran, issues new warning to Russia

BREAKING: Iran rejects negotiations with the US over nuclear program

Tensions between the United States and Iran escalated further Saturday after a leading Iranian state-run newspaper, closely linked to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei , published a shocking call for the assassination of US President Donald Trump.The editorial, published by the hardline Kayhan newspaper , included a chilling statement: “He’s way out of line! Any day now, in revenge for the blood of Martyr Soleimani, a few bullets are going to be fired into that empty skull of his and he’ll be drinking from the chalice of a cursed death.”The article appeared just days after Trump made a provocative statement warning of military strikes if Iran refuses to cooperate on its nuclear weapons program. “If they don't make a deal, there will be bombing,” Trump said. “But there's a chance that if they don't make a deal, that I will do secondary tariffs on them like I did four years ago.” He also confirmed, “The US and officials from the Islamic Republic are talking.”Trump’s remarks appear to have provoked Kayhan, often regarded as a mouthpiece for the supreme leader. The paper wrote, “He makes threats and then backs down! The result? The situation in America gets worse by the day. Just yesterday, it was announced that his actions have caused $3 trillion in damage to the US economy, American exports are facing serious problems, and top officials in the military, CIA, and elsewhere have either resigned or been dismissed.”Iranian-born Israeli analyst Beni Sabti, a fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies, warned that Iran’s regime is trying to stoke global animosity toward Trump. “[They] want to unite the world against Trump and wants someone to shoot Trump, and also they want to bring the economic issue against him,” he said. Sabti likened the regime's rhetoric to the 2022 stabbing of author Salman Rushdie in New York, saying the current climate is fueled by the same dangerous propaganda. “It is very good opportunity for the Trump administration to file a complaint with United Nations Security Council,” he added.The inflammatory language in Kayhan follows years of threats from Iran’s regime in retaliation for the 2020 US drone strike that killed Qassem Soleimani , a top general in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps . At the time, Trump ordered the strike citing Soleimani’s role in orchestrating the deaths of over 600 American troops. Since then, Iranian officials have promised vengeance, including potential plots to kill Trump and members of his administration.Jason Brodsky, policy director at United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), noted that Kayhan has consistently advocated for Trump’s assassination. “Kayhan has repeatedly threatened to assassinate President Trump for years. Kayhan’s editor Hossein Shariatmadari is a personal representative of Iran’s supreme leader,” he told Fox News.Brodsky further stressed, “Such threats ring hollow the demands of Iranian officials for there to be ‘mutual respect’ during future negotiations with the United States.” He added that the threats align with past Iranian attempts to assassinate US figures and should disqualify any diplomatic overtures from the regime. “The Trump administration should make clear that there can be no negotiations while Iran’s regime is threatening and plotting to kill American citizens.”Brodsky also called on the US to impose sanctions on Kayhan and its editor, stating, “The US should also sanction Hossein Shariatmadari and Kayhan. The US Treasury Department previously designated Iranian media networks like PressTV and Tasnim. It should do so with Kayhan as well. Canada has already sanctioned Kayhan given its record of threats.”Just months ago, the US Justice Department revealed it had disrupted a plot orchestrated by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps aimed at assassinating Trump. A federal court filing detailed how a 51-year-old Iranian national, Farhad Shakeri, was tasked in September with surveilling and potentially killing the US president.The threats from Iran have not only been verbal. In a disturbing escalation, Iranian state media even released an animated video depicting Trump’s assassination. The video, reportedly uploaded to a website linked to Khamenei himself, simulated a targeted strike on Trump in what was widely interpreted as state-sponsored incitement.While Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian has publicly stated that Iran is open to dialogue, “We don’t avoid talks; it’s the breach of promises that has caused issues for us so far,” he told the Associated Press. He insisted that trust must be rebuilt before talks can resume: “They must prove that they can build trust.”Even so, Pezeshkian acknowledged that some level of indirect contact with the Trump administration is ongoing. The White House and US State Department have not publicly responded to the renewed threats or diplomatic gestures as of yet.As the rhetoric intensifies, observers warn that Iran’s blend of violent threats, state propaganda, and aggressive nuclear posturing could lead to even more instability in the region—and could derail any remaining hopes for negotiation.","The editorial, published by the hardline Kayhan newspaper, included a chilling statement: “He’s way out of line!

In a move that could deepen tensions between Washington and Juba, the United States has revoked all visas held by South Sudanese passport holders. The decision, announced Saturday, comes in response to South Sudan’s refusal to accept the return of its citizens who are being repatriated from the USSecretary of State Marco Rubio said the decision takes effect immediately. “Effective immediately, the United States Department of State is taking actions to revoke all visas held by South Sudanese passport holders and prevent further issuance to prevent entry into the United States by South Sudanese passport holders,” Rubio said.Rubio emphasized the US stance that “every country must accept the return of its citizens in a timely manner when another country, including the US, seeks to remove them.” He added, “We will be prepared to review these actions when South Sudan is in full cooperation.”The secretary also criticized South Sudan’s transitional authorities, stating: “It is time for South Sudan’s transitional government to stop taking advantage of the United States.”The South Sudanese embassy in Washington has yet to comment on the visa revocations.The visa sanctions come as tensions rise within South Sudan’s borders. This past week, African Union mediators arrived in the capital, Juba, to launch crisis talks aimed at preventing another outbreak of civil war. The nation has been on edge following the recent house arrest of First Vice President Riek Machar.President Salva Kiir’s administration has accused Machar of attempting to incite rebellion, reigniting fears of a return to widespread violence. Machar, a longtime political rival of Kiir, led opposition forces during the brutal civil conflict between 2013 and 2018—a war largely fought along ethnic lines that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives.The conflict pitted fighters from the Dinka ethnic group, Kiir’s base, against those from the Nuer group, aligned with Machar. Though recent violence in Upper Nile state has involved the White Army militia—historically allied with Machar—his camp denies any current association with the group.The Trump administration, under which Rubio currently serves as Secretary of State, has taken a hardline stance on immigration enforcement. Part of its policy has been to penalize countries that fail to cooperate with deportation procedures, with consequences ranging from visa suspensions to potential tariffs.Saturday’s move represents one of the most sweeping visa actions taken against an African nation during this administration, and it comes at a time when many observers worry that South Sudan could slide back into conflict.",The move comes in response to South Sudan’s refusal to accept the return of its citizens who are being repatriated from the US.

Fort Bend’s Indian-American judge indicted for alleged money laundering,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fort-bends-indian-american-judge-indicted-for-alleged-money-laundering/articleshow/120028159.cms,"Representative photo

Fort Bend County Judge K P George, a prominent Indian-American Democrat who has held office since 2018, was arrested Friday on two felony counts of money laundering . The charges stem from allegations of wire fraud and falsifying a campaign finance report , with potential prison time of up to 10 years if convicted.Court documents and statements from the Fort Bend County District Attorney 's Office allege George laundered an amount between USD 30,000 and USD 150,000. He was booked into the county jail around 3:30 p.m. and released shortly after, having posted USD 20,000 in bail.The District Attorney's Office claimed that the charges announced Friday are separate from an earlier case. In 2023, George and his former chief of staff, Taral Patel, were indicted over accusations that they created fake social media accounts to manufacture racist attacks targeting George's 2022 re-election campaign.“These charges are unrelated to the pending misdemeanour,” the DA’s office clarified. “Our office remains committed to the integrity our public deserves and the ethics to which all prosecutors are sworn.”Political fallout was swift. County Treasurer Bill Rickert urged George to resign, referencing both the 2023 scandal and the current charges. “Fake racism scandals” and the latest indictment, Rickert said, are cause for serious concern. Former Precinct 4 Constable Trever Nehls, who ran against George in 2022, also weighed in. “This indictment is not surprising. I saw during the campaign how lies and hate were used to manipulate voters,” he said.Responding to the arrest, George insisted he is innocent and framed the indictment as politically motivated. “I have full faith in the judicial system and will vigorously defend my innocence,” he said in a statement released Friday. He further accused the DA’s office of “improper treatment.”In response, the District Attorney’s Office dismissed the claim, stating the investigation was carried out in compliance with all legal and ethical obligations.The news has sent shockwaves through Fort Bend County, one of Texas’s fastest-growing and most demographically diverse regions. Political analyst Elena Martinez of the University of Houston noted that “an indictment like this, especially involving alleged financial misconduct, can severely erode public trust even before a trial.” She added that the case is likely to draw attention beyond the county line due to Fort Bend’s rising national profile.Adding to the intrigue, George's office had announced just a day prior to the arrest that his annual State of the County address, originally planned for May 8, was being postponed indefinitely. No reason was provided at the time.Authorities confirmed that the investigation is still underway.","K P George, a prominent Indian-American Democrat, was arrested Friday on two felony counts of money laundering.

Who are the militant groups?



Which are the most affected regions?



What are the consequences of the rising violence?



More than 100 deadly attacks in Pakistan by Islamist militants and separatist rebels made March the deadliest month over a decade with 335 people killed, a think tank reported Thursday.Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) think tank. They included 73 members of security services, including soldiers and police officers, 67 civilians and 88 militants.The Islamist-militant Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the separatist rebel Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) were the main militant groups responsible for the attacks.The BLA was responsible for a 28-hour hijacking of the train Jaffar Express in the southwestern region Balochistan. Some 450 people were held hostage and more than two dozen were killed.Balochistan was the most affected province, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the northwest of Pakistan.They have both also been targets of suicide bombings, a form of attacks that surged in March.In Punjab, the eastern province bordering India, the think tank observed a strong increase in militant activity.At least seven attacks were recorded, and most were attributed to the TTP.In response to the growing threat, Pakistan's security forces have intensified their operations in the region. Many people have been arrested with connections to militant groups, including the TTP.Islamabad claims that most attacks, both by militants and rebels, are planned and executed from Afghanistan. It accuses the neighboring country of granting Pakistani militants space to plan and organize attacks.A recent report by the United Nations supported this claim. It said that the Taliban provided support to the TTP and that some attacks were launched from Afghan territory.As a consequence, the Pakistani government has urged the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan to act against the allegedly responsible criminals. Kabul, on the other hand, denies that the militants are in Afghanistan.","Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.

He maintains his innocence, asserting that the charges are politically driven.","Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to human rights and democratic values.

Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.The operation, in Katlang, a remote hilltop area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, was aimed at militant hideouts and resulted in the deaths of 12 suspected terrorists. However, it also led to the deaths of 10 civilians, including women and children, sparking outrage.Government spokesman Muhammad Ali Saif confirmed the casualties and said that the location was being used as a hideout and transit point for terrorists. He admitted that unarmed civilians were present at the site.""The safety of civilians is always a top priority during such operations. However, due to complex geography, terrorists using civilian populations as cover, and the urgent nature of the operation, unintended consequences can sometimes occur,"" said Saif, as quoted by the Associated Press.The provincial government has now promised an inquiry into how the operation led to civilian deaths.Local residents reported that the victims were nomads from the Swat region who had been living in the Shamozai mountains with their livestock. Their families protested by placing their bodies on the Swat Highway, demanding justice.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur called the incident “highly condemnable and tragic.” He assured that every effort is made to avoid civilian casualties but acknowledged the challenges of military operations in complex terrains where militants embed themselves among civilians.The government said medical aid is being provided to the injured, and compensation for the victims' families is being arranged.

Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295"", a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.The case was filed after his video promoting the fragrance sparked outrage, particularly from the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which places blasphemy at the core of its political agenda.Butt, who boasts millions of followers online, announced the perfume in a now-deleted video, referencing Section 295 of Pakistan’s penal code, which deals with blasphemy. The move triggered widespread condemnation, with TLP leader Haider Ali Shah Gillani filing a formal complaint against him on Monday.""There are numerous sections in the penal code, but why did he choose blasphemy-related sections to name a perfume?"" Gillani was quoted by the news agency AFP, accusing Butt of attempting to ""normalise"" disrespect towards religious laws.According to AFP, the police charge sheet confirms that Butt has been charged under both blasphemy and cybercrime laws. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.As the controversy increased, Butt released an apology video on Sunday, holding a Quran as he sought forgiveness. ""I apologise for the words I uttered during the launch of the perfume,"" he said. He also announced the immediate discontinuation of the product.The controversy also relates to the late Indian rapper Sidhu Moose Wala ’s song ""295,"" which also referenced blasphemy laws. Butt had previously likened himself to Moose Wala, claiming they both faced persecution under similar legal provisions, according to Daily Pakistan.This is not Butt’s first legal battle. In January, he pleaded guilty to illegally owning a lion cub, which he had received as a wedding gift.A Pakistani court ordered him to create 12 educational videos on animal welfare as part of his punishment. He avoided jail time by pledging to use his platform to raise awareness about responsible treatment of wild animals.Blasphemy remains an extremely sensitive issue in Pakistan, where accusations, often unverified, can lead to mob violence and even killings.The legal provisions under Section 295 have been widely criticised by human rights groups for being used as a tool to target individuals, including religious minorities and public figures.","Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295,"" a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.

Protect minorities: Modi. Restrain Hasina: Yunus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/protect-minorities-modi-restrain-hasina-yunus/articleshow/119993504.cms,"PM Modi meets Bangladesh's Muhammad Yunus on the sidelines of Bimstec Summit (Picture from X @narendramodi)

B'desh says reports of attacks on minorities 'hugely inflated'

PM Modi on Friday asked Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus to ensure safety and security of minorities, including Hindus, in the country and thoroughly investigate ""atrocities"" committed against them.In their first bilateral meeting since the formation of the interim govt in Dhaka in Aug 2024, Modi sought positive and constructive relationship with Bangladesh based on pragmatism, and urged Yunus to avoid rhetoric that could vitiate the atmosphere.However, as Modi broached the subject of minorities and increasing radicalisation, a Bangladesh readout said, Yunus called for a reality check against what he described as social media propaganda and said ties should be shaped on basis of principles like territorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs.Yunus came to the meeting in Bangkok armed with his own list of issues Dhaka considers important, including the extradition of Sheikh Hasina , border killings, Saarc cooperation and pending Teesta water-sharing agreement. Even in the absence of any assurance that India would consider extraditing the ousted PM, Bangladesh authorities described the meeting as constructive and fruitful, but called upon India to restrain her from making inflammatory statements. Modi touched upon the issue of polls in Bangladesh as he reiterated India's support for a democratic, stable, peaceful, progressive, and inclusive neighbour. According to Bangladesh, Modi said India's ties are with the country and not with a political party or organisation.PM Modi underlined that India believed in a people-centric approach to the relationship and highlighted the cooperation between the two countries over a long period that has delivered tangible benefits to people in both countries,"" said foreign secretary Vikram Misri.According to Misri, the PM spoke at length about the issue of minorities, expressing deep concern over their plight and telling Yunus how violence against them impacts society in India too. He expressed hope Bangladesh would be able to fulfil its responsibility of protecting minority communities.However, the minority issue remained a sticking point as Yunus, according to the Bangladesh readout of the meeting, said the reports of attacks on minorities were hugely inflated and ""the bulk of them were fake news"". He asked Modi to send reporters to Bangladesh to investigate the alleged attacks themselves.""The chief adviser said he has instituted an effective system for monitoring every incident of religious and gender violence in the country, and his govt was taking serious actions to stop any occurrence of such incidents,"" said Dhaka in a statement.While calling for Hasina to be extradited, Yunus also accused the former PM of destabilising Bangladesh through her ""inflammatory"" statements from India, calling it an abuse of the hospitality extended to her by the Indian govt. He also accused Hasina of committing crimes against humanity, citing a UN report about the human rights violations under her govt.""We request that Indian govt take appropriate measures to restrain her from continuing to make such incendiary statements while she remains in your country,"" said Yunus. Interestingly, according to Dhaka, Modi blamed social media for tensions over Hasina's remarks and said India doesn't have special preference for any party or individual.He also said Bangladesh remained thankful for the ""unwavering support"" of the govt and people of India during its most challenging time in 1971. ""Excellency, we seek to work together with you to set the relationship on the right track for the benefit of both our peoples,"" said Yunus, according to Bangladesh.While Yunus raised the issue of border killings, Modi told him strict enforcement of the law and prevention of illegal border crossings, especially at night, are necessary for maintaining border security and stability. The Bangladesh readout quoted Modi as saying Indian border troops opened fire only in self-defence and the fatalities occurred in Indian territories. Yunus stressed it is important to address this issue to build trust between the countries.""PM expressed his conviction that all issues of mutual interest between the two countries would continue to be addressed and resolved bilaterally through constructive discussions, in the interest of their long standing and mutually beneficial bilateral relationship,"" said the Indian govt. Modi also congratulated Yunus for taking over as Bimstec Chair and Yunus sought India's support for a free trade agreement that the inter-regional group is discussing.",PM Modi meets Bangladesh's Muhammad Yunus on the sidelines of Bimstec Summit.

Sacked Nepal official crowdfunds to pay fine imposed on Gyanendra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sacked-nepal-official-crowdfunds-to-pay-fine-imposed-on-gyanendra/articleshow/119960937.cms,"KATHMANDU: Supporters of Nepal's former king Gyanendra Shah have raised Nepal Rs 4.8 lakh (INR 3 lakh) so far through a crowdfunding campaign launched by a recently sacked govt-appointed tourism promoter, who was removed for publicly supporting the ex-monarch and criticising the govt as corrupt. The funds are being collected to help Shah pay a Nepal Rs 8 lakh (Rs 5 lakh)-penalty imposed by Kathmandu Metropolitan City for damage to public property during last week's pro-monarchy protest in central Kathmandu.This came even as govt sanctioned Nepal Rs 10 lakh (Rs 6.3 lakh) each for families of the two people killed in the violence. Meanwhile, Shah on Thursday denied any role in the unrest, saying the incident was triggered ""because of lapses and failures within govt"", rejecting the charge by PM K P Sharma Oli that the ex-king had incited the violence.A statement issued by Shah's secretariat said, ""The govt's shortcomings and weaknesses are responsible for this tragic incident."" Shah's communication secretary added that neither the palace nor the former monarch's supporters would take responsibility for the violence, vandalism or looting.""By holding him responsible for the deaths and arson, Oli govt is attempting to hide its own failures."" Rameshraj Bastola , who was dismissed from his role as tourism promoter in Lisbon, Portugal, on March 10 after he publicly supported Shah, contributed Nepal Rs 50,000 (Rs 31,000) and urged others to join the effort. Bastola said he did not wish to serve under a ""corrupt govt"".He wrote, ""If you have any objections to my support for the king and religion, you may keep the post for yourself.""RPP member Swati Thapa said, ""Yes, there's a spontaneous wave of support. People are contributing small and large amounts to make a statement - that this isn't just about a fine or money. It's about solidarity."" On Thursday, Nepal Police said they used 58 rounds of live ammunition and 746 tear gas shells, with 20 people sustaining bullet wounds, in the violence. Nepal's ministry of home affairs said it had instructed the ministry of finance to disburse compensation to families of Sabin Maharjan, who was shot during the protest, and photojournalist Suresh Rajak, who died while covering the event.",Supporters of Nepal's former king Gyanendra Shah have raised Nepal Rs 4.8 lakh (INR 3 lakh) so far.

UFO Sightings UK: UK: Spinning orb over sky leaves residents stunned,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-spinning-orb-over-uk-sky-leaves-residents-stunned/articleshow/119987917.cms,"UK: Spinning orb over UK sky leaves residents stunned (Picture credit: X)

A dazzling, spiralling light in the night sky left many across the UK startled last week, with social media abuzz over possible UFO sightings. The peculiar orb, spotted in multiple regions including Greater Manchester, Derbyshire, Lancashire, Yorkshire, Staffordshire, and even parts of the south, prompted widespread speculation, reported Express.Residents took to social media to describe the event, with one person exclaiming, ""Pretty certain I just saw a UFO. Did anyone else see it?"" Another posted, ""Has anyone else just seen this over Radcliffe in the sky? Me and the kids are freaked out.""Some described a bright object surrounded by misty white rings, moving slowly before vanishing.While some joked about Batman or alien portals, experts were quick to clarify that the eerie display was likely caused by the launch of a SpaceX rocket.According to the Manchester Evening News, the event coincided with the deployment of a US spy satellite, NROL-69, which lifted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida aboard a Falcon 9 rocket.Similar spiral anomalies have been recorded before, including in 2023 when a SpaceX launch from California created a comparable sight in the US sky. This phenomenon occurs when excess fuel is vented into space, forming frozen vapour clouds that reflect sunlight, producing the mesmerising swirling effect.As per The Mirror, many who witnessed the spectacle were initially unsettled, with some believing it to be an unidentified flying object. However, space experts assure that such occurrences, while rare, are a known side effect of certain rocket launches.Despite the logical explanation, the celestial show left a lasting impression, with one observer summing it up: ""It was spinning, then just disappeared into the distance. Absolutely unreal.""","A dazzling, spiralling light in the night sky left many across the UK startled last week.
