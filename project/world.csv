India Flags Pakistan Role In Bangladesh Protests, Backs Awami League Demand For Free & Fair Polls

NEW DELHI: A parliamentary standing committee on external affairs has warned that India is facing its most significant strategic challenge since the 1971 war, due to the evolving political and security situation in Bangladesh, pointing to the resurgence of Islamist forces, weakening domestic political structures and growing influence of China and Pakistan in Dhaka.The committee on Thursday tabled its 9th report titled ‘Future of India-Bangladesh Relationship’ in the Lok Sabha. The panel, chaired by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , said that while the situation does not pose an immediate existential threat to India, it represents a deeper, long-term strategic test with implications for regional stability and India’s neighbourhood policy.“India faces its greatest strategic challenge in Bangladesh since the Liberation war of 1971. While the challenge in 1971 was existential, a humanitarian and a birth of a new nation, the latter was of a graver, a generational discontinuity, a shift of political order, and a potential strategic realignment away from India,” the report said quoting an expert.The committee took into account multiple testimonies from government officials and non-governmental experts, the panel also noted that Bangladesh’s ongoing political transition and shifting external alignments could reshape India’s security and foreign policy environment over time.According to the panel, a key source of uncertainty is the declining political dominance of the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League. While the party secured 224 of 300 seats in the January 2024 elections, the panel flagged an estimated voter turnout of around 40 per cent, which raises concerns over popular participation, political legitimacy, institutional control and public confidence.On the stay of former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina in India the panel said, ""The Committee note that the stay of former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, in the country and India's approach in this regard is guided by its civilisational ethos and humanitarian tradition of offering refuge to individuals facing circumstances of grave distress or existential threat,"" the report said.”The panel recommended that the government should ""continue to uphold its principled and humanitarian approach"", consistent with India's values and international responsibilities, while ensuring that such situations are ""managed with due sensitivity"".The committee also pointed towards the emergence of youth-led nationalist sentiment alongside a renewed presence of Islamist groups, warning that the combination could act as a destabilising force with implications for both Bangladesh’s internal security and the wider region.Another major concern flagged by the panel is the expanding footprint of China and Pakistan in Bangladesh. It said these developments could dilute India’s traditional influence in Dhaka and complicate New Delhi’s strategic calculus in its immediate neighbourhood.“...The event was marked by collapse of Awami League dominance, the surge of youth-led nationalism, the re-entry of Islamists and intensifying Chinese and Pakistani influence collectively..if India fails to recalibrate at this moment, it risks losing strategic space in Dhaka not to war, but to irrelevance,” report added.The ministry of external affairs told the committee that India has made concerted efforts to insulate bilateral ties from recent political developments and to continue engagement with Bangladesh’s interim government, while supporting the wishes of the Bangladeshi people.On the question of collaboration between both nations, the route through SAARC and BIMSTEC also came up to which the foreign secretary told the panel, until Pakistan changes its state policy of cross border terrorism there can be no conversation around reviving SAARC.“We have made it very clear to anybody and everybody in SAARC who is coming up to us with proposals for reviving it that we cannot have dialogue and terrorism go on at the same time. Until Pakistan changes its policy of crossborder terrorism as an instrument of State policy, there is no possibility of going forward with SAARC. I did make the point also that BIMSTEC does pretty much everything that SAARC does and then some other things and since the organisation is headquartered in Dhaka, it would be useful if Bangladesh takes it forward. I must say that there was no pushback against it….” the report quoted foreign secretaryThe panel, however, questioned why Indian authorities failed to anticipate the political crisis despite what it described as warning signals and extensive media reporting ahead of the developments. In response, the government said the situation in Bangladesh is being monitored on a priority basis with continuous assessments underway.Concluding its report, the committee stressed that Bangladesh’s evolving political trajectory and external alignments would require sustained attention from India, given the country’s central role in regional stability.In its suggestions the committee said, “The Committee urge the Government to continue advocating a democratic, stable, peaceful, people-centric, forward-looking and inclusive Bangladesh, firmly anchored in the spirit of 1971 and mutual respect. The Committee further recommend that the Government should maintain sustained diplomatic engagement with all political, social, and civil society stakeholders in Bangladesh to foster an environment of trust and dialogue. Such engagement should be complemented by Track II and Track 1.5 diplomacy, involving Parliamentary exchanges, think tanks, academia, media, and cultural organizations, to strengthen people-to-people connections and counter misperceptions.”","The committee on Thursday tabled its 9th report titled ‘Future of India- Bangladesh Relationship’ in the Lok Sabha.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday announced that the state government’s job scheme ‘Karmashree’ will be renamed after Mahatma Gandhi , saying she felt “ashamed” that the Father of the Nation’s name was being removed from welfare scheme at the national level.Speaking at a public event, Banerjee said the scheme, which provides 75 to 100 days of employment, would be renamed to honour Mahatma Gandhi, asserting that the state would uphold the legacy of national leaders if the Centre fails to do so.“We have started a scheme ‘Karmashree’, Gandhi ji name is not there. I’m really sorry, I'm ashamed. I’m feeling shame, father of the nation, MGNREGA program named after him, now the bill came Gandhi ji name won’t be there,” Banerjee said.She added, “I can’t blame anybody except me because I belong to this country. I'm feeling ashamed because we are even forgetting the father of the nation.”The CM said the scheme’s name would now be changed to reflect Mahatma Gandhi’s legacy. “So we have started a scheme called ‘Karmashree’, it’s name will be changed to Mahatma ji scheme. It will also give 75 to 100 days of job…we’re not beggars,” she said.Banerjee also took a swipe at the Centre, saying, “We only won’t respect nothing else, if you will not give respect to Mahatma ji we will.”In her address, Banerjee invoked several national leaders, what she described as Bengal’s inclusive ethos.“We know how to give respect to Mahatma ji, Neta Ji, Guru dev Rabindranath, Baba Sahaeb Ambedkar, Maulana Abul kalam, Sardar Patel, Lal Bal Pal, we love every community,” she said.The remarks come amid an ongoing political row over changes made to the name of MGNREGA, including the omission of Mahatma Gandhi’s name from official titles, which the TMC and other opposition parties have criticised.",West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced that the state government’s job scheme ‘Karmashree’ will be renamed after Mahatma Gandhi.

Nitish Kumar's Hijab Shocker: BJP MP Giriraj Singh Defends Bihar CM's Act With 'Go To Hell' Remark

What was the controversy?

Opposition calls it 'cheap mentality':

NEW DELHI: Union minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh on Thursday defended Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar after a video showing him pulling down the hijab of a woman doctor during an official programme went viral. He claimed that there was “nothing wrong” in the chief minister’s action.On reportedly being asked about the woman at the centre of the row may refuse to take up the government job, Singh said it was up to the woman to refuse the government job or “go to hell”. He added that Kumar “has done nothing wrong” and framed the incident as a procedural act.“Whether she refuses the job or goes to hell, that is her choice,” Singh said.Defending Nitish, the union minister argued that the incident should not be viewed through a religious lens and described the chief minister’s action as that of a guardian verifying identity at an official function.“If someone is going to collect an appointment letter, should they not show their face? Is this some Islamic country? Nitish Kumar acted as a guardian,” Singh said.Drawing parallels with other official procedures, he added, “When you go to get a passport, do you not show your face? When you go to the airport, do you not show your face? People talk about Pakistan and Englishtan, but this is India.In India, the rule of law prevails.”The controversy stems from an incident earlier this week during an appointment letter distribution programme for newly recruited AYUSH doctors at the chief minister’s residence in Patna.A video shared by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on X shows Nitish Kumar on stage alongside deputy chief minister Samrat Choudhary and health minister Mangal Pandey.When a woman doctor, identified as Nusrat Parveen, approached the stage with her face covered by a hijab, Kumar appeared displeased, remarked “What is this?”, bent down and pulled the veil down.The woman was seen visibly flustered as an official moved her aside, while Samrat Choudhary appeared to tug at Kumar’s sleeve, seemingly trying to restrain him.According to the Chief Minister’s Office, the programme involved the distribution of appointment letters to 1,283 AYUSH doctors, including Ayurveda, Homeopathy and Unani practitioners, with only 10 receiving letters in person and the rest online.The incident and union minister's comments drew sharp criticism from opposition parties. Congress MP Tariq Anwar called Singh’s statement indicative of a “cheap mentality” and condemned Kumar’s action as “shameful and saddening”.""These are third-rate people, they have a cheap mindset. They dont understand that our country is secular. Everyone is free to practice their religion. What Nitish Kumar has done is shameful and saddening,"" Anwar said.Reacting to Singh's statement, J&K CM Omar Abdullah said: ""This is exactly what we can expect from the BJP. If it had been a Hindu woman from Rajasthan or Haryana, wearing a veil, and I had removed it, would the BJP have said the same thing? Imagine the uproar if a Muslim leader had removed the veil of a Hindu woman. But now, because it was a Muslim woman doctor, the BJP's reaction is different. What else can we expect from them?""Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Iltija Mufti also expressed outrage, saying such remarks and acts are deeply offensive to Muslim women.""Only phenyl will work to clean this man's filthy mouth. You dare not touch the hijabs & naqabs of our Muslim mothers and sisters. Otherwise we Muslim women will set you right by teaching you a lesson you and your ilk will remember for all times to come,"" she said in a post on X.NCP (SP) MP Fauzia Khan also hit out at both leaders.""It is very saddening that responsible people do such acts, this will send a wrong message in the world. It is a personal decision of a woman as to how much she covers up and removing the veil is akin to disrobing a woman. He (Kumar) should have given a pubic apology but instead of that they are saying that what happened was right,"" she said.RJD MP Manoj Jha said the visuals were “unsettling” and raised serious concerns, adding that such actions did not send a good message from the state’s top constitutional authority.The Congress also came down heavily on the Bihar chief minister, calling the act “shameless” and “vile” and demanding his resignation.Congress MP Sukhdeo Bhagat said the incident was condemnable and violated traditions and faith, while the party said publicly humiliating a woman at a government event raised questions about women’s safety and dignity.""This does not seem appropriate from any angle. Treating a woman like this is condemnable,” Bhagat said.Leaders from other opposition parties echoed similar concerns. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi said no one, regardless of position, had the right to publicly humiliate an adult woman for her choice of attire, stressing that equality must be rooted in consent. The AAP also criticised the incident, warning against normalising control over women’s choices.Amid the outrage, the BJP sought to counter the criticism by sharing an old video of former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot removing a woman’s ghoonghat, arguing that the opposition was being selective in its outrage. BJP leaders also accused opposition parties of politicising the issue for electoral gains.The row further escalated after Uttar Pradesh minister Sanjay Nishad made controversial remarks defending Kumar, which were widely criticised as misogynistic.Nishad later said his comments were misunderstood due to translation issues and offered to withdraw them if they had hurt sentiments, even as opposition parties continued to demand an unconditional apology.",Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar pulled down the hijab of a woman doctor during an official programme.

'Paid Campaign': Nitin Gadkari Slams Criticism Of E20 Program; Calls It 'Politically Motivated'

New Delhi: Concerned about instances of poor quality and substandard work in several national highway (NH) projects, the office of road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari has sought details of all show-cause notices issued to contractors since Jan 2024, the responses received from companies and the action taken so far. Agencies have been directed to submit the details within 15 days.TOI has learnt that the minister’s office said that representations regarding poor-quality work had been submitted to officials concerned and that, in many cases, show-cause notices were issued. However, information on final action taken after replies were received has not been submitted in several instances.In a letter issued to the heads of highway agencies, it was stated that Gadkari has “expressed serious dissatisfaction” over the continuing deficiencies in construction quality and inadequate action against non-performing contractors.The minister has now sought comprehensive reports on notices issued to such defaulters, their responses — including corrective measures taken by them — and details of final action taken, such as imposition of monetary penalties and termination of contracts after scrutiny of replies.The minister’s office has also sought the current status of cases where responses are still under scrutiny, along with reasons for the pendency.The move gains significance in light of the rising instances of structural failures and damage to highway stretches, including on newly opened corridors, reported from different states.",Road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari has sought details of all show-cause notices issued to contractors since Jan 2024.

The bill had sought to grant ownership rights to residents living in houses built on state land for over 20 years.Parra, the legislator from Pulwama, had described it as an “anti-bulldozer bill” meant to safeguard rights of residents issued eviction notices.The assembly on Oct 28 rejected the bill after Omar said granting ownership of illegally-constructed houses on state land would only reward encroachers.Mehbooba, however, said elected govt had a responsibility to safeguard the rights of people and it shouldn’t divest the public from their rights citing “strategic area” reasons and allot fertile land to forces. “CM should shift the project to barren land, not fields that feed and sustain families,” she said, adding she would take up the issue with the defence minister as well.

NEW DELHI: Central armed forces will be deployed at the office of the West Bengal chief electoral officer (CEO) in Kolkata and will assume responsibility for its security on Friday, an official said.The Ministry of Home Affairs has approved the Election Commission's (EC) proposal in this regard, the official added.“Central forces personnel will take charge of security on the second and third floors of the CEO’s office from Friday morning. They will also accompany officials of the CEO’s office when they travel outside the premises in government vehicles,” he told news agency PTI.The decision follows repeated protests by Booth Level Officers (BLOs) outside the CEO’s office during the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls. Demonstrators have staged sit-ins, with this raising concerns over the security of the premises.The protests were triggered by the deaths of several BLOs during the roll “purification” exercise, with the families of the deceased and leaders of the ruling Trinamool Congress alleging that many of the fatalities were linked to work pressure arising from SIR duties.The West Bengal assembly elections will be held in April-May next year.Meanwhile, the EC on Thursday issued a show-cause notice to a voter after the individual’s name was found to be registered in two assembly constituencies—Shyampukur in Kolkata Uttar and Ashoknagar in North 24 Parganas—during draft roll verification.At one location, the voter personally signed the enumeration form, while at the other, the form was signed by another person.An official explained that such duplication could be linked to a change of address, but the notice was issued to establish the facts. “The objective is to seek the voter’s explanation and also examine the role of the BLO and other concerned officials,” the official added.According to another official, the move forms part of ""increased scrutiny"" of the ongoing SIR exercise, aimed at strengthening oversight and addressing any procedural or administrative lapses.","Central armed forces will be deployed at the office of the West Bengal chief electoral officer (CEO) in Kolkata.

KARWAR: A GPS-tagged migratory seagull on Karwar beach on Wednesday sparked curiosity and suspicion in equal measure among locals, before forest officials clarified that the device was part of a scientific study tracking migration pattern of birds.The exhausted bird fitted with the tracking device was rescued by forest department officials after locals noticed the unusual attachment and raised an alert.The bird, which appeared tired and had sustained minor injuries, was brought to the forest department office for examination. Officials confirmed that the device was a GPS tracker used for scientific research to study migration patterns.Forest department sources said they contacted the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka (WNPS), which confirmed that it had tagged the bird as part of a long-term migration study. Although the tracker was manufactured in China — a common source for such equipment — authorities ruled out any surveillance or espionage angle.A section of the media went on an overdive speculating that the tracker may be a spy camera as the INS Kadamba naval base was nearby. However, officials clarified that the device contained no camera.Data retrieved from the tracker indicated that the seagull had flown over 10,000 km, including across Arctic regions, before reaching Karwar.After the GPS unit was safely removed, the bird was moved to the forest department office.Police and intelligence officials visited the beach to verify details and confirmed that the incident posed no security concern.Authorities urged the public not to spread misinformation, stressing that GPS tagging is a standard practice in wildlife research to study migratory routes of avians.",A migratory seagull with a GPS tracker on Karwar beach sparked curiosity and suspicion among locals.

Australian influencer Ashy Bines, 37, is under fire after a social media post linked the deadly Bondi Beach terror attack to promotion of her paid wellbeing program. The attack shocked the nation and left families grieving after 15 people were killed and 40 others were sent to hospital during a Hanukkah gathering at Bondi Beach on December 14.Soon after the attack, Bines shared a post on Instagram talking about how hard the day felt for Australians. She wrote, “I feel everyone in Australia is waking up feeling sick just thinking about everyone impacted by Bondi. May we support one another and never forget the power of kindness in times like these.”However, the post also directed her one million followers to sign up for her Rise Inside podcast and wellbeing program, which costs $50 a month, if they were feeling “wobbly.” This is where the backlash began.Ashy Bines added another message saying, “If I’m ever feeling anxious feelings and wanting to feel more calm, it’s nice to know in less than five minutes that can all change with stopping, breath, connection.” She then promoted four short calming meditations from her paid program.Many followers felt the influencer crossed a line by promoting a paid service while talking about a national tragedy. The comments section quickly filled with anger. One person wrote, “Does anyone else find it really bad taste and just gross that Ashy Bines is using the awful terrorist attack in Bondi to advertise her Rise Inside subscription?”Another added, “Any influencer using this tragedy to pivot or push a business or product should go straight in the bin.Absolutely foul.” Others said using the word “wobbly” to describe the feelings of victims and families was upsetting.After the strong backlash, the post was deleted. Bines has not made a public statement responding to the criticism.The Bondi Beach terror attack was described as Australia’s worst mass shooting in three decades. It targeted Jewish families celebrating Hanukkah. Among the victims was 10-year-old Matilda, remembered by her teacher as “bright, joyful, and spirited.” Her parents spoke for the first time at a candlelight vigil, calling her “the most kindest person, child ever.”Rabbi Eli Schlanger lost his cousin in the attack. His cousin was described as “vivacious, optimistic and full of energy and life.” Hundreds gathered to mourn the victims, including at Matilda’s funeral on December 18.As the country continues to grieve, many online say this moment called for silence and respect, not promotion.Also Read: Who is influencer Ash Trevino?

NEW DELHI: Officials from the Enforcement Directorate (ED) have seized multiple luxury vehicles belonging to a Uttar Pradesh-based YouTuber as part of a money laundering investigation linked to suspected illegal online betting networks.Officials said a Lamborghini Urus, a Mercedes, a Ford Endeavour and a Mahindra Thar were seized during searches at multiple locations on Wednesday.The raids targeted premises linked to Anurag Dwivedi, an online cricket influencer originally from Unnao district, as well as the homes of his relatives in nearby towns.The federal agency searched nine premises in Lucknow, Unnao, and Nawabganj, recovering documents believed to show investments in Dubai real estate allegedly made using funds routed through hawala networks.Officials said the YouTuber has been living in Dubai and has ignored multiple summons for questioning.The ED’s case stems from an FIR registered by West Bengal Police alleging cheating, forgery and illegal betting operations in Siliguri. Investigators claim two accused men, Sonu Kumar Thakur and Vishal Bhardwaj , ran online betting panels using Telegram channels, suspicious bank accounts and digital platforms.According to ED officials, Dwivedi is suspected of playing an “active role” in promoting these platforms.He allegedly created promotional videos and received illegal payments through hawala operators, mule bank accounts and cash couriers.Authorities say the funds were deposited into the bank accounts of his companies and family members without legitimate commercial justification.On Wednesday, ED and CRPF teams arrived at Dwivedi’s village home in Khajur under Ajgain police station. When officers found the house locked, security personnel remained on guard until Dwivedi’s mother was brought from the village to open it.Searches continued late into the evening, with officials examining various rooms and seizing documents related to bank transactions, property papers and digital devices.According to news agency PTI, investigators are also checking whether the alleged illegal earnings – running into crores – came partly through fantasy cricket platforms, including Dream11, and whether these were linked to unauthorised betting networks.Dwivedi, who has been making cricket-related videos for about seven years, has amassed a substantial social media following.He drew attention last month after videos surfaced of his wedding to a Lucknow woman aboard a cruise in DubaiCircle officer Hasan Ganj Arvind Chaurasia confirmed the searches at the homes of Dwivedi, his father and uncle, saying CRPF personnel were deployed as a precaution. He declined to comment further, citing the ongoing investigation.","Lamborghini Urus, a Mercedes, a Ford Endeavour and a Mahindra Thar seized.

Why it's a concern for India





Sharif Osman Hadi, youth leader of Bangladesh’s 2024 uprising has died in Singapore after succumbing to injuries sustained in an assassination attempt, officials said on Thursday.Hadi, who was the spokesperson of political platform Inqilab Mancho, was critically wounded after being shot by unidentified assailants in Dhaka on December 12. He was first taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital and later shifted to Evercare Hospital as his condition deteriorated.He was airlifted to Singapore last week for advanced medical treatment and admitted to the Singapore General Hospital’s Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit.Confirming his death, Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement: “Despite the best efforts of the doctors, Mr (Sharif Osman) Hadi succumbed to his injuries.” Medical teams from the Singapore General Hospital and the National Neuroscience Institute treated him but were unable to save his life.The Singapore foreign ministry said it is assisting the Bangladesh High Commission in the country with arrangements to repatriate Hadi’s body to Bangladesh.Inqilab Mancho announced Hadi’s death in a social media post late Thursday night, saying he passed away after fighting for his life for six days, as reported by Bangladesh news channel Daily Star.Hadi was an aspiring independent candidate from the Dhaka-8 constituency and emerged as a prominent figure following the 2024 “July uprising” that led to the ouster of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.The shooting triggered strong political reactions in Bangladesh, coming days after the parliamentary election schedule was announced on February 12.Bangladesh’s chief adviser Muhammad Yunus condemned the attack, calling election-related violence “completely unacceptable.”“No form of violence intended to disrupt the election will be tolerated. The incident is a worrying development for the country’s political landscape,” Yunus had said.Investigations into the attack are ongoing, with several suspects detained for questioning by Bangladeshi authorities.Bangladesh had summoned India's high commissioner last week to demand cooperation in the attempted assassination case of Hadi.Dhaka specifically raised concerns regarding the ""attempted assassination"" and sought India's cooperation to prevent suspects involved in the attack from escaping into Indian territory and requested that if they manage to cross the border, India should ensure their ""immediate apprehension and extradition"".Days after the attack, the Muhammad Yunus administration in Dhaka sought India's help to arrest and hand over the shooters.New Delhi has, however, strongly rejected the allegations that the attackers had any connection with India.The MEA, in a statement, had stated that India categorically rejects the assertions made by the interim government of Bangladesh in its press note dated December 14 about the attack on radical leader Sharif Osman Hadi, the spokesperson of the Anti-Sheikh Hasina Inqilab Manch.""We have consistently reiterated our position in favour of free, fair, inclusive and credible elections being held in Bangladesh in a peaceful atmosphere,"" the MEA statement said.""India has never allowed its territory to be used for activities inimical to the interests of the friendly people of Bangladesh,"" the statement added.""We expect that the interim government of Bangladesh will take all necessary measures for ensuring internal law and order, including for the purpose of holding peaceful elections,"" the statement said.","Sharif Osman Hadi, youth leader of Bangladesh’s 2024 uprising has died in Singapore.

Sharif Osman Hadi's death fuel outrage







Bangladesh descended into widespread unrest overnight after the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a prominent youth leader of the country’s 2024 pro-democracy uprising.Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Dhaka late Thursday and early Friday, demanding justice for Hadi, who died in a Singapore hospital after succumbing to gunshot injuries sustained in an assassination attempt last week.Demonstrations spread from Dhaka to other parts of the country, with protesters attempting to march toward Indian diplomatic premises and attacking properties linked to the former ruling Awami League.Protesters in the southwestern city of Rajshahi tried to march toward the office of a regional Indian diplomat, but police stopped the procession. Several videos on social media showed incident of stone pelting near Indian assistant High Commission office.In Dhaka on Wednesday, hundreds of demonstrators attempted to gather outside Indian diplomatic premises, including the residence of India’s deputy high commissioner, prompting police to use tear gas to disperse the crowd.Members of the National Citizen Party (NCP), a major offshoot of Students Against Discrimination (SAD), which led last year’s protests, joined the demonstrations, chanting anti-India slogans and alleging that Hadi’s assailants had fled to India after the killing.Protest leaders called on the interim government to shut the Indian High Commission until the suspects were returned.“The interim government, until India returns assassins of Hadi Bhai, the Indian High Commission to Bangladesh will remain closed. Now or Never. We are in a war!,” PTI quoted Sarjis Alm, a key leader of NCP, as saying.The protests came hours after a parliamentary committee on external affairs called the current situation in the neighbouring nation ""complex and evolving"".""The committee has been informed that the current situation in Bangladesh is complex and evolving. There is uncertainty regarding the schedule of democratic elections. The political events of August 2024 have created significant instability and uncertainty with incidents of violence, attacks and intimidation of minorities, tribal communities, media groups, intellectuals, journalists, academicians, etc. , becoming the norm,"" it said in its report titled 'Future of India-Bangladesh Relationship'.Several buildings in the capital were set ablaze as the protests escalated, including offices housing the country’s two largest newspapers, Prothom Alo and The Daily Star.Fire officials confirmed at least three incidents of arson, with journalists and staff trapped inside the buildings as firefighters battled the flames, according to media reports.""Several hundred demonstrators reached the Prothom Alo office around 11 pm and later surrounded the building,” PTI quoted a witness saying, who added that the protesters then set the Daily Star office on fire.The violence quickly spread beyond the capital. Protesters torched an Awami League office in Rajshahi and vandalised properties linked to former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India after being ousted in last year’s uprising.Demonstrators also blocked a key highway connecting Dhaka with Mymensingh and attacked the residence of a former minister in the southeastern city of Chittagong, according to local media footage.Hadi, 32, was a senior leader of the student-led platform Inqilab Mancha and a vocal critic of both Hasina. He was shot by masked assailants on December 12 while leaving a mosque in central Dhaka and was later airlifted to Singapore for advanced medical treatment, where he succumbed to his injuries on Thursday.Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus described Hadi’s death as an “irreparable loss for the nation,” announced a day of mourning, and ordered special prayers nationwide.Police have launched a nationwide manhunt for the attackers, releasing photographs of two suspects and offering a reward of five million taka for information leading to their arrest, as authorities warned that the violence risked destabilising the fragile political transition.","Bangladesh descended into widespread unrest overnight after the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a prominent youth leader of the country’s 2024 pro-democracy uprising.

Ghaziabad suitcase murder: How domestic help thwarted tenant couple's plan to flee with landlady’s body,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/ghaziabad-suitcase-murder-how-domestic-help-thwarted-tenant-couples-plan-to-flee-with-landladys-body/articleshow/126067565.cms,"How domestic help thwarted tenant couple's plan to flee with landlady’s body

NOIDA: The prompt presence of a domestic help foiled a chilling escape plan after a 48-year-old landlady was allegedly murdered by her tenants over unpaid rent at a housing society in Raj Nagar Extension on Wednesday night.According to police, the sequence began around 5.30 pm when Deepshikha Sharma went to the tenants’ flat with her domestic help, Minni, to demand five months of overdue rent.The woman tenant, Aakriti Gupta, reportedly said her husband Jay was not home and asked them to return later after arranging the money.When Deepshikha went back later in the evening, Minni wasn’t with her. “She called me and told me she was going to Jay and Aakriti’s flat to collect the rent. I told her not to go alone and said I would finish my work and join her. But she was determined to collect the rent this time and went all by herself,” Minni said on Thursday.When she failed to return, Minni grew worried and went to check on her. Jay allegedly told her the landlady had just left. Suspecting something was wrong, Minni searched the society but could not find Deepshikha anywhere.She then returned to the couple’s flat and noticed them hurriedly preparing to leave, with blood stains visible on the floor.Minni blocked their exit and alerted Deepshikha’s husband, Umesh Sharma, before forcing her way into the flat. It was then that she discovered Deepshikha’s blood-soaked body inside the apartment and called the police. The police control room received the call around 11.15 pm.Neighbours later told investigators that they had seen Jay and Aakriti attempting to leave the building with a suitcase in an autorickshaw, using the staircase instead of the lift. Their plan was aborted after an unrelated heated argument broke out between two families on the ground floor, prompting the couple to return to the flat.Police said the confrontation inside the fifth-floor flat in Tower F turned violent when Deepshikha pressed for immediate payment. During questioning, Jay allegedly confessed that an argument escalated into a scuffle between his wife and the landlady.Investigators said Aakriti strangled Deepshikha with a dupatta, while Jay struck her on the head with a pressure cooker taken from the kitchen. The couple then stuffed the body into a suitcase and hid it in the bed box, planning to dispose of it later.Minni’s second visit thwarted the couple's plans to dispose of the body. “They would have probably fled had Minni not raised the alarm,” said ACP (Nandgram) Upasana Pandey.Police said the couple was under severe financial distress. Jay, who ran a transportation business, had suffered heavy losses, forcing them to sell their house in Sanjay Nagar and move into rented accommodation. Officers added that the couple struggled to meet daily expenses and were dealing with personal health issues.Investigators are now probing whether there had been previous altercations between the landlady and the tenants and are reconstructing the exact sequence of events leading to the killing.","Landlady Deepshikha Sharma, 48, was allegedly murdered by her tenants over unpaid rent at a housing society in Raj Nagar Extension on Wednesday night.

What exactly has Trump announced?



Does this mean marijuana is now legal in the US?



What about CBD?



Why is this politically significant?



Who is opposing the move?



The big picture







For decades, marijuana has occupied a strange place in American politics. It is widely used and culturally mainstream, yet under federal law it has long been treated like a hard narcotic. Now, in a move that would have been unthinkable during the Reagan-era “war on drugs”, President Donald Trump wants the federal government to ease its stance on cannabis users. The aim is not to legalise or celebrate marijuana, but to stop treating it as if it belongs in the same legal category as heroin. Here’s what that actually means, and what it does not.Trump has directed federal agencies to relax restrictions on marijuana and expand access to CBD, the non-intoxicating compound derived from cannabis that is commonly used for pain relief, epilepsy treatment, and anxiety management.The most consequential part of the move is his support for reclassifying marijuana under federal law. Currently, cannabis is listed as a Schedule I drug, a category reserved for substances deemed highly addictive with no accepted medical use. Think heroin or LSD.Trump wants marijuana shifted to Schedule III, placing it alongside regulated prescription drugs like ketamine or codeine-based painkillers.No. And Trump has been explicit about that.Marijuana would remain illegal under federal law. This is not decriminalisation, let alone legalisation. Federal trafficking laws still apply, and states that restrict cannabis can continue to enforce their own laws.What changes is the tone and priority of federal enforcement, especially against users and medical research institutions.In short: Washington is backing off. It is not giving a green light.Why does reclassification matter so much?Because Schedule I status has acted like a scientific chokehold.Researchers studying marijuana currently face layers of red tape that make large-scale, credible medical studies extremely difficult. Moving cannabis to Schedule III would make medical research far easier, allowing doctors and scientists to study its effects without navigating bureaucratic minefields.There is also a financial angle. Cannabis companies have long been denied standard tax deductions because the federal government technically treats them as drug traffickers. Reclassification would allow them to deduct business expenses, offering major relief to an industry that is legal in many states but punished at the federal level.Trump’s move also expands access to CBD-based treatments, including a pilot programme allowing Medicare beneficiaries to be reimbursed for certain CBD therapies.CBD does not produce a high. It is already widely used for managing chronic pain, cancer-related symptoms, and neurological disorders. But its legal status has remained murky, especially after recent legislation threatened tighter crackdowns on cannabinoid products.The administration has asked Congress to clarify regulations so that medical CBD remains legally available, rather than being swept up in drug enforcement dragnet logic.Because it marks a Republican break from drug-war orthodoxy.For decades, conservative politics treated marijuana as a moral failing and a gateway menace. Trump’s stance reflects a reality that voters already live with: cannabis is mainstream, medical, and legal in most of the country at the state level.More than 40 states allow medical marijuana. Nearly half permit recreational use. Federal policy was the outlier.This is also a rare case of continuity. The push to reclassify marijuana began under the Biden administration. Trump is choosing to finish it.Some conservatives argue that easing restrictions sends the wrong message to young people and risks normalising drug use. Others warn that reclassification could complicate FDA oversight, especially since marijuana products are often marketed in edible or lifestyle-friendly forms.Public health experts are also cautious. While marijuana has medical benefits, evidence remains mixed for certain conditions, and long-term effects are still being studied.Trump’s answer, characteristically, is pragmatic rather than philosophical: study it properly, regulate it better, and stop pretending it’s something it isn’t.This is not a cultural revolution. It is a bureaucratic correction.Marijuana is no longer being treated as a Cold War-era bogeyman. The federal government is slowly aligning with medical science, state laws, and social reality.In classic Trump fashion, it is framed not as a moral pivot, but as common sense. The war rhetoric fades. The paperwork changes. And the user, for once, is not the enem",Marijuana would remain illegal under federal law. Federal trafficking laws still apply. States that restrict cannabis can continue to enforce their own laws. Trump’s stance reflects a reality that voters already live with. More than 40 states allow medical marijuana. Nearly half permit recreational use.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126069571,imgsize-116752,width-400,resizemode-4/trump-signs-executive-order-that-could-reclassify-marijuana-as-a-less-dangerous-drug.jpg"

Protests turn violent, journalists trapped inside burning offices



Why the unrest matters for India?







Bangladesh witnessed widespread unrest overnight on Thursday after the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a prominent youth leader and vocal critic of ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, triggering violent protests in parts of Dhaka and attacks on major media houses.Hadi, 32, died at a hospital in Singapore on Thursday, where he had been undergoing advanced treatment after being shot by masked assailants on a motorbike on December 12. He was attacked while riding in a rickshaw and was later airlifted abroad for medical care.The shooting had taken place just a day after Bangladeshi authorities announced a date for the country’s first elections since the 2024 uprising, elections that Hadi was planning to contest as an independent candidate.As news of Hadi's death spread late Thursday and early Friday, hundreds of his supporters poured onto the streets of Dhaka demanding justice and the arrest of those responsible for the killing.At least three incidents of arson were reported in the capital, including fires at buildings housing Bangladesh’s leading newspapers: The Daily Star and Prothom Alo, a spokesperson for the Fire Brigade and Civil Defence force told AFP.Groups of protesters stormed the offices of both newspapers, vandalising the premises before setting parts of the buildings on fire. Journalists and staff were trapped inside as smoke filled the offices.Zyma Islam, a reporter for The Daily Star, described the ordeal as she remained trapped inside the burning building. ""I can’t breathe anymore. There’s too much smoke. I am inside. You are killing me,"" she wrote on Facebook.The fire at The Daily Star office was brought under control at around 1.40 am, officials said, but 27 employees were still inside at the time.""We took refuge at the rear of the building and could hear them chanting slogans,"" Daily Star reporter Ahmed Deepto told AFP, referring to the protesters.A journalist told bdnews24 that staff had received a phone call warning them that a crowd was moving towards the newspaper’s premises. When newsroom employees tried to move downstairs, they found that the mob had already vandalised the lower floors before setting them on fire. Night-shift staff reportedly fled to the terrace to save their lives.At least 25 journalists were rescued over four hours following the attack at the Kawran Bazar office, bdnews24 reported. Firefighters rescued people using ladders, while army contingents were later deployed around the buildings.""Hundreds of people have gathered here and carried out the attack,"" a police officer told BBC Bangla. Troops were later deployed to secure the area. Witnesses said protesters first vandalised the Prothom Alo office before setting fire to The Daily Star building.It remained unclear why the two outlets, both known for their passive support for interim leader Muhammad Yunus, were targeted.In a televised address, Yunus announced special prayers at mosques on Friday and declared a day of mourning on Saturday. ""Hadi's demise is an irreparable loss for the nation,"" Yunus said, urging protesters to remain calm.The violence spilled beyond media houses.Hundreds of protesters surrounded the residence of India’s deputy ambassador in Dhaka, prompting police to use tear gas to disperse the crowd, according to local media reports.Protesters also blocked a key highway leading out of the capital, attacked the residence of a former minister in Chittagong, and vandalised Chhayanaut, a cultural institution in Dhaka.Large crowds gathered at Shahbagh intersection near Dhaka University, chanting slogans such as "" Who are you, who am I – Hadi, Hadi.""According to AFP, student groups including Jatiya Chhatra Shakti and the National Citizen Party (NCP) joined the demonstrations.NCP leaders alleged that Hadi’s attackers had fled to India and called for the closure of the Indian High Commission until they were returned.""The interim government, until India returns assassins of Hadi Bhai, the Indian High Commission to Bangladesh will remain closed. Now or Never.

BELAGAVI: It’s a gentle — and rather quiet — rap on the knuckle for about 500 school students to heave themselves out of playgrounds, start looking into their satchels and study. It’s also a reminder for elders to walk across the street and greet neighbours and reconnect with lost threads of friendly conversation. For once, there’s no white noise, ear-splitting ringtones or ad jingles on the big screen from 7pm to 9pm, all days of the week.Welcome to Halaga village, about 10km from Belagavi and home to Suvarna Vidhana Soudha. At 7pm, a sharp siren cuts through the evening air and all screens — TV, laptops, tabs and mobiles — go blank. On Wednesday, Halaga with a population of 12,000 became the first village in Karnataka to adopt ‘digital detox’.The community-driven initiative is called ‘No TV, No Mobile, Just Study and Conversation’. The primary aim is to reclaim evening hours for learning and family interaction.The no-screen initiative was inaugurated by gram panchayat president Laxmi Gajapati, inspired by a similar experiment in Agran Dhulgaon village of Sangli district in Maharashtra, which drew national attention for its impact on students’ learning habits.The Maharashtra village launched the restricted screen time in 2022 just as effects of Covid lockdown were tapering off.The village has two govt schools and as many private schools with a combined student population of 500. The school quartet has been posting above-average pass results.Former gram panchayat president Ganpat Marihalkar said the intention was simple: Prioritise academics, which is increasingly getting affected by excessive screen time. Marihalkar said the gram panchayat invests Rs 2.5 lakh every year from its own funds to strengthen the two govt schools in the village.On the choice of timing, social worker Anil Shinde said, “The 7pm to 9pm slot is prime time for TV serials and dramas. That is exactly when distractions are highest.”","Halaga with a population of 12,000 became the first village in Karnataka to adopt ‘digital detox’ The community-driven initiative is called ‘No TV, No Mobile, Just Study and Conversation’ It was inspired by a similar experiment in Agran Dhulgaon village of Sangli district in Maharashtra.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126068903,imgsize-1298810,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/screens-go-blank-as-karnataka-village-adopts-digital-detox.jpg"

After Donald Trump , several other celebrities have now become the new target of the House Oversight Committee as Democrats released new photos from Jeffrey Epstein ’s estate on Thursday, on the eve of the Department of Justice’s deadline to release all of its files on his case.The Committee released around 70 photographs, drawn from Epstein’s computer and email accounts, there were among 95,000 handed over by Epstein’s estate last week and were provided to the committee without context. They shed further light on his lifestyle and social circles.One image shows former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. Another features Noam Chomsky seated beside Epstein on a plane.Several photographs depict a social gathering over a meal and include faces of powerful or public figures, among them Epstein. A separate image, apparently from the same room, shows Google co-founder Sergey Brin beside New York Times columnist David Brooks.A New York Times spokesperson said in a statement, “As a journalist, David Brooks regularly attends events to speak with noted and important business leaders to inform his columns, which is exactly what happened at this 2011 event.Mr. Brooks had no contact with him before or after this single attendance at a widely-attended dinner.”Several images in the new release show Epstein with women whose faces have been redacted. One photograph appears to show three women with Epstein beside an open computer, one of the women with her arm around his shoulder. Another shows Epstein seated on a plane, pointing out a window while a woman sits closely beside him; her face has also been obscured.Some photos in this batch offer close-ups of a foot and a neck, both inscribed in black pen with quotes from the book Lolita.Additional items include identification cards or passports of several unidentified people from countries such as Russia and the Czech Republic, a hand holding open Epstein’s own passport, and what appears to be a screenshot of text messages saying ""I will send u girls now"",” with another one showing an unknown sender writing, “Maybe someone would be good for J?” and including the age and body measurements for an unidentified person. There is also a hand holding a drug bottle labelled for phenazopyridine, a generic analgesia used to relieve urinary tract pain and burning.The latest cache of photographs comes a day before the Justice Department’s deadline to release the Epstein files, after Congress mandated the information be made public.Rep. Robert Garcia, Democratic ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, said in a statement Thursday, “Oversight Democrats will continue to release photographs and documents from the Epstein estate to provide transparency for the American people.” He added, “As we approach the deadline for the Epstein Files Transparency Act, these new images raise more questions about what exactly the Department of Justice has in its possession. We must end this White House cover-up, and the DOJ must release the Epstein files now.”","House Oversight Committee releases new photos from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate.

Sydney: Terrifying New Video Shows Aussie Couple Confronting Bondi Gunmen; Watch What Happened Next





Australia will observe a national day of reflection on Sunday (December 21), one week after the deadly Bondi Beach mass shooting that killed 15 people, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced on Friday, as he urged the country to reject “hatred and violence”.Albanese called on Australians to light candles at 6:47 pm local time, marking the exact moment the attack unfolded.“It is a moment to pause, reflect, and affirm that hatred and violence will never define who we are as Australians,” he said.Flags on New South Wales and Australian government buildings will be flown at half-staff, reported CNN.The attack, described as Australia’s worst mass shooting in nearly three decades, took place on Sunday evening during a beachside Hanukkah celebration.Authorities have said the assault was antisemitic in nature. Sajid Akram, 50, and his son Naveed, 24, are accused of carrying out the shooting. Sajid was killed in a gunfight with police, while Naveed survived and has been charged with 15 counts of murder, an act of terrorism, and multiple other offences, according to news agency AFP.Albanese said there was “something wrong with the licensing laws” that allowed Sajid Akram to legally own six long-barrelled, high-powered rifles.He announced a sweeping national gun buy-back scheme aimed at removing newly banned and illegal firearms from private ownership, reported CNN.Calling it the biggest gun buy-back since 1996, Albanese said hundreds of thousands of weapons were expected to be collected and destroyed. States and territories will handle collection and payments, while federal police will destroy the firearms.The prime minister also pledged tougher measures to combat antisemitism, including new powers to target extremist preachers and to cancel or refuse visas for people who spread hate and division. “It is clear we need to do more to combat this evil scourge,” Albanese said.Emotional scenes played out at Bondi Beach on Friday as hundreds of locals swam into the ocean in a show of solidarity. “They slaughtered innocent victims… and being part of my community again brings back the light,” security consultant Jason Carr said, as per AFP.Others described the gathering as carrying a “beautiful energy” amid grief and anger.Meanwhile, Sydney remains on high alert. Police said they detained two carloads of men following a tip-off about a possible “violent act”, though no direct link to the Bondi attack has been established.Authorities are also investigating whether the accused were inspired by the Islamic State group, with Albanese saying intelligence agencies had identified online ISIS-linked material reinforcing that assessment.",Australia will observe a national day of reflection on Sunday (December 21) One week after the deadly Bondi Beach mass shooting that killed 15 people.

The suspected shooter in the Brown University shooting was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to Fox News.According to the officers, the suspect was identified as Claudio Manuel Neves-Valente, a 48-year-old Brown University student and Portuguese national from Miami, Florida.The authorities have released the photo of the suspect.On Thursday, authorities told CBS sources they were probing connections between the Brown University shooting and the death of Nuno F Gomes Loureiro, 47, from Portugal, who was shot “multiple times” on Monday at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, about 80 km from Providence. Police have obtained an arrest warrant for a suspect, sources said. They added that a rental car matching the same description was seen at both crime scenes.Incidentally, the alleged shooter and the MIT professor, are both from Portugal.On Wednesday, investigators released a photo of an individual believed to have been in close proximity to their primary person of interest. Providence police chief Oscar Perez said they wanted to speak with the person, “who may have information relevant to the investigation”. He added that the killer “could be anywhere” and “we don’t know where the person is or who he is”.A day earlier, police showed footage of a person of interest in a black mask walking around the university campus, possibly “casing” the area before the crime, Perez said.Members of the public have expressed frustration over the investigation’s slow progress. In response, Rhode Island attorney general Peter Neronha said he believed the killer would be caught “and it is just a matter of time before we catch him”.The FBI has offered a Rs 41.5 lakh reward for information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of the person responsible for the attack.The shooting occurred at Brown University’s Barus & Holley engineering building during final exams. Authorities identified the two students killed as Ella Cook, a sophomore from Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, an Uzbek-American freshman.","Suspect identified as Claudio Manuel Neves-Valente, a 48-year-old Brown University student and Portuguese national from Miami, Florida.

It’s not every day that an FBI director finds himself at the centre of a social-media nudge toward matrimony — but Kash Patel ’s love life is suddenly trending almost as much as his job.Patel’s country-singer girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins , appears to be waging a very public, emoji-laced “propose already” campaign, amplifying hints, reposts and playful prods that suggest she’s ready for an engagement ring sooner rather than later.The online cheerleading comes at an awkward moment for the 45-year-old FBI chief, whose relationship with the 27-year-old aspiring musician has already drawn scrutiny over his alleged use of bureau perks to visit and protect her. Still, Patel has stood firmly by Wilkins — and she seems more than happy to stand right beside him, preferably with a ring involved.On Monday Wilkins shared an X post by right-wing activist Xaviaer DuRousseau praising Patel after news of foiled New Year’s Eve bomb plots in Los Angeles.DuRousseau wrote, “God bless you @FBIDirectorKash 🙏🏾 And please propose to my friend soon 😌” Wilkins responded, “Xaviaer over here with facts 😉” She later reposted his Instagram story, adding, “Ride or D1e KING over here 🫶 @xaviaer.”Katie Miller, wife of former Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, teased Patel and Wilkins’ appearance on her podcast, asking, “Where’s her ring?” with both Patel and Wilkins laughing in the clip.Patel defended their relationship in an X post, calling Wilkins “the woman I’m proud to call my partner in life,” and “a country music sensation who has done more for this nation than most will in ten lifetimes.”Insiders told MS Now that Patel twice ordered Wilkins’s security detail to drive a friend home and in one instance shouted at the team leader to comply. News of Patel’s use of $60 million in private jet services and the assignment of SWAT agents prompted national outcry.Rumours that Patel’s position is at risk have circulated, following criticism of his handling of cases including the Brown University mass shooting. White House Secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed speculation that Patel would be dismissed, posting a photograph of Patel with President Donald Trump from November.","Kash Patel’s country-singer girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins, appears to be waging a very public, emoji-laced “propose already” campaign.

JERUSALEM: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that he has approved a $35 billion natural gas export deal to Egypt, the biggest gas deal in Israeli history. The agreement could also help repair relations between the two countries strained during the two-year war in the Gaza Strip.The gas will be delivered to Egypt over the next 15 years by U.S. energy giant Chevron, a key owner of the gas field off Israel's coast in the Mediterranean Sea. Half of the proceeds are expected to go to Israel's state coffers.In a recorded video statement, Netanyahu said the deal ""greatly strengthens Israel's position as a regional energy power, and it contributes to stability in our region.""Egypt, which borders both Israel and Gaza, has served as a key mediator between Israel and the Palestinian militant Hamas group leading up to the U.S.-brokered ceasefire that was agreed on in October. Cairo has also has been a vocal critic of Israel's offensive, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused widespread destruction in Gaza.Egypt did not immediately confirm Netanyahu's announcement.Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen, a close Netanyahu ally, previously held up the deal with Egypt, claiming the terms were not favorable to Israel. His delays prompted U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright to cancel a trip to Israel in October.But Cohen stood alongside Netanyahu during the Wednesday evening announcement and said he supported the final terms of the deal.Israel discovered sizeable natural gas fields off its Mediterranean coast in the early 2000s and began exporting gas - first to Jordan and later to Egypt - nearly a decade ago.In a separate development, German lawmakers approved an expansion of a defense agreement for Israel's sophisticated Arrow 3 missile defense system, Israel's defense ministry said Wednesday.The expansion brings the value of the deal from $3.5 billion to $6.5 billion, making it the largest Israeli defense export deal ever, according to the ministry.

‘Vulgar Act Of Piracy’: Venezuela Slams Trump’s Total Naval Blockade, Warns Global Energy Crisis





WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has filed a criminal complaint in Sweden accusing senior figures linked to the Nobel Foundation of serious economic crimes and of facilitating war crimes, following the award of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado The complaint, submitted to Sweden’s Economic Crime Authority (Ekobrottsmyndigheten) and the War Crimes Unit (Krigsbrottsenheten), names around 30 individuals, including Nobel Foundation chair Astrid Söderbergh Widding and executive director Hanna Stjärne. Assange alleges breach of trust, gross misappropriation of funds, conspiracy, and the facilitation of war crimes and crimes against humanity.In a statement shared by WikiLeaks on X, the organisation said Assange’s legal action is aimed at preventing the release of more than $1 million that Machado is set to receive as part of the award. The filing seeks an immediate freeze on the pending SEK 11 million ($1.18 million) prize transfer and calls for a full criminal investigation.The complaint cites Alfred Nobel’s 1895 will, which stipulates that the Peace Prize be granted only to individuals who have “conferred the greatest benefit to humankind” by doing “the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.”Assange argues that “The political decision of the Norwegian selection committee does not suspend the fiduciary duty of Swedish funds administrators,” adding that “Any disbursement contradicting this mandate constitutes misappropriation from the endowment. ”Assange’s filing contends that Machado’s public endorsement of US President Donald Trump and the administration’s military actions, which the complaint frames as contributing to war crimes, provides sufficient legal grounds for the Nobel Foundation to suspend all financial disbursements linked to the prize. “Alfred Nobel’s endowment for peace cannot be spent on the promotion of war,” Assange said, alleging that Machado “has continued to incite the Trump Administration to pursue its escalatory path” against Venezuela.The complaint also cites precedent within the Nobel system, noting that Nobel Foundation officials exercised supervisory authority by withholding prize-related disbursements in 2018. Assange argues that, having previously intervened to halt payments, Nobel officials were legally obliged to do so again and that failure to intervene in the present case “incurs criminal liability” under Swedish law.The filing explicitly invokes Sweden’s obligations under Article 25(3)(c) of the Rome Statute, arguing that continued disbursement of Nobel funds, despite knowledge of Machado’s public positions, could amount to facilitating the crime of aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Assange has asked authorities to seize internal records, including board minutes and financial documents, interrogate senior Nobel officials, and either pursue a domestic investigation or refer the matter to the International Criminal Court.In October, Machado described her Nobel Peace Prize win as an “immense recognition” of her country’s struggle for democracy and dedicated the award to US President Donald Trump. In a post on X following the announcement, she wrote: “This immense recognition of the struggle of all Venezuelans is a boost to complete our task: to conquer Freedom. We are on the threshold of victory and today, more than ever, we have President Trump, the people of the United States, the peoples of Latin America, and the democratic nations of the world as our main allies to achieve Freedom and democracy. Venezuela will be free!”Speaking to reporters in Oslo last week, hours after her daughter accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf, Machado said: “I think that the actions of President Trump have been decisive… Now they start to understand that this is serious, and that the world is watching.” She declined to answer directly whether US military intervention was necessary to oust Maduro.Assange warned that without intervention, the Peace Prize risks being “permanently converted from an instrument of peace into an instrument of war.”","WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has filed a criminal complaint in Sweden accusing senior figures linked to the Nobel Foundation of serious economic crimes.

The Donald Trump administration, in an expected move, widened the travel ban to include more African countries from which people can't now travel to the US, even for studying. The list now has 39 countries and is effective from January 1, 2026. But there are various degrees of travel ban -- full and partial -- and a lot to decode.In July, the administration announced 12 countries that are under a full travel ban which means the US completely blocks the entry of people from these countries, no matter who they are, what their purpose of visit is. Only a very few exceptions are allowed, depending on the case. These countrymen can not apply for any visa and even if someone has a valid visa, it is considered suspended. No new visa is issued. But it does not mean that people from these countries who have obtained US citizenship will be stripped of their citizenship.Trump added seven countries to this listThis category also includesNationals from these countries will not be able to come to the US for travel purposes or to study. H-1B work visas are not suspended but consular officers have been asked to reduce the validity of any visa.Turkmenistan got some restrictions lifted as its nationals can now apply for B, F, M and J categories of visa.People who are inside the US with a valid visa on or before January 1, 2026 are exempt from the travel ban. Existing visas will not be revoked. Athletes, coaches traveling for the World Cup, Olympics are exempt as determined by the State Department.""Fiancé visas (K-1) are being treated like immigrant visas (generally non-immigrant) for the proclamation. So if you are filing for a fiancé in one of the 39 banned countries, they are being treated like spouses of US citizens and they are also banned,"" immigration attorney Brad Bernstein said.","The Donald Trump administration widened the travel ban to include more African countries.

The real breakthrough





With just hours left before a court-mandated disclosure, Congressional Democrats on Thursday released dozens of new photographs from Jeffrey Epstein ’s estate, intensifying pressure on the justice department to open its long-sealed files on the late financier and convicted sex offender.Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have released 68 disturbing images from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, offering a chilling window into his network and alleged crimes. The photos include:•Passages from Lolita inked across a woman’s body•Redacted IDs of women from seven countries•Late-night texts arranging girls for someone named “j” at $1,000 eachThe images are part of a 95,000-photo archive now in the committee’s hands.The US justice department faces a December 19 deadline to release its Epstein investigation records under the Epstein Files Transparency Act.“We must end this White House cover-up,” said Rep. Robert Garcia, the committee’s top Democrat. “The DOJ must release the Epstein files now.”Photos also show Epstein alongside major figures including President Donald Trump , Bill Gates, Noam Chomsky, and Steve Bannon. Only the White House has responded, dismissing the release as irrelevant: “The Trump administration has delivered on transparency,” said spokesperson Abigail Jackson.The origins of Epstein’s wealth explain how he was able to operate with impunity for decades. His fortune allowed him to:* Buy access to politicians, scientists, and celebrities.* Acquire properties where abuse occurred.* Fund an international sex-trafficking ring that entrapped hundreds of girls and young women.As Senator Ron Wyden said, “Following the money is how, in our country, we’ve had a long history of catching and rooting out corrupt behavior.”Jeffrey Epstein wasn’t born into money, didn’t finish college, and wasn’t a Wall Street prodigy - but he built a fortune that funded his access to billionaires, presidents, and underage girls. His rise was marked by brazen lies, insider connections, and a knack for manipulating powerful men who repeatedly looked the other way.A New York Times investigation paints the clearest picture yet: Epstein was less a financial genius, more a grifter in a suit - one who gamed the system, rigged deals, and monetized relationships, all while constructing a predatory sex-trafficking network that shocked the world.Epstein story, pieced together through years of reporting by The New York Times and others, reveals something less cinematic than espionage or secret client lists, and more unsettling: a career built on proximity, manipulation, and a near-total absence of consequences.In 1976, Epstein was a 23-year-old math teacher at the Dalton School, a prestigious private school on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. He was about to be asked to leave. His teaching was undistinguished. His credentials, as it turned out, were fictional.Then he attended an art gallery opening.A Dalton parent introduced Epstein to another parent, who in turn placed a phone call to Ace Greenberg, the legendary Bear Stearns executive. Epstein showed up to the firm’s offices wearing a turtleneck and knowing almost nothing about Wall Street.Greenberg hired him anyway.Bear Stearns prided itself on recruiting what Greenberg called “P.S.D.s” - poor, smart, and driven. Epstein fit the mold. He was soon earning a Wall Street salary and dating Greenberg’s daughter, a relationship that conferred informal protection inside the firm, according to former colleagues interviewed by The New York Times.Within months, Epstein was caught lying about having college degrees. He admitted it calmly. His supervisor confronted him. Nothing happened.It would not be the last time.At Bear Stearns, Epstein learned less about finance than about leverage.According to the Times, he abused expense accounts, charged luxury travel for girlfriends, and improperly allocated “hot” initial public offering shares to people he was sleeping with. He loaned money in ways that violated brokerage rules. He was questioned by the Securities and Exchange Commission during an insider-trading investigation.Each time, Epstein escaped serious punishment.By 1980, he was named a limited partner, pulling in the equivalent of more than $800,000 a year. Cosmopolitan magazine named him “Bachelor of the Month,” describing him as someone who “talks only to people who make over a million a year.”Bear Stearns eventually opened a formal investigation. Epstein resigned before the penalties could land.What he took with him was more valuable than a severance package: credibility.After leaving Bear Stearns, Epstein styled himself as a financial fixer, adviser and, at times, what he called a “bounty hunter” - someone who recovered lost or hidden assets for wealthy families.In practice, the line between consulting and con artistry was thin.A British defense contractor, Douglas Leese, hired Epstein and later accused him of abusing expense accounts. A businessman named Michael Stroll entrusted Epstein with $450,000 - roughly ten percent of his net worth - for a supposed oil deal. Most of the money disappeared. Epstein eventually prevailed in court on technical grounds.“He’s a despicable prick,” Stroll later said in an unpublished interview cited by the Times.Again, there were no real consequences.According to reporting by The New York Times, Epstein exaggerated relationships, borrowed prestige from old employers, and continued answering his phone “Bear Stearns” long after leaving the firm. Former colleagues kept introducing him to clients. Doors stayed open.Each small deception funded the next.Epstein’s first undeniable windfall came not from trading but from recovery.In the early 1980s, the brokerage firm Drysdale Securities collapsed, wiping out millions for wealthy families, including Spanish aristocrats. Epstein, through a girlfriend, was hired to help track down missing funds. Working with a former federal prosecutor, he located money hidden in offshore accounts.The reward made him a millionaire.From there, Epstein moved into larger circles, exaggerating his role with powerful figures, including David Rockefeller - an association the Times later reported Epstein inflated far beyond reality. He cultivated foundations, donated strategically, and used famous names as social currency.By the late 1980s, Epstein had found his most important patron: Leslie Wexner, the billionaire retail magnate behind Victoria’s Secret. Wexner granted Epstein sweeping control over his finances. That relationship would underwrite Epstein’s mansions, private jets, and global mobility.It would also insulate him for years.(With inputs from agencies)","Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have released 68 disturbing images from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate. The images offer a glimpse into his network and alleged crimes, including explicit tattoos and redacted IDs. This release is another attempt by Democrats to put pressure on authorities to disclose records concerning the late financier's activities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126068672,imgsize-224622,width-400,resizemode-4/126068672.jpg"
Can Trump rename the Kennedy Center? Board vote sparks constitutional debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/can-trump-rename-the-kennedy-center-board-vote-sparks-constitutional-debate/articleshow/126067346.cms,"



A board handpicked by President Donald Trump voted Thursday to rename the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts as the Trump–Kennedy Center, inserting the sitting president’s name alongside one of the nation’s most revered political legacies.Within hours, the centre’s website reflected the change — even as critics warned the board may have raced ahead of the law.Congress named the Kennedy Center in 1964, following President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, and legal historians say only Congress can formally alter that designation. But Trump, who chairs the board after reshaping it with loyalists since returning to office, welcomed the vote as an “honour,” saying he was surprised by the decision.But the board did not wait for that debate to play out, immediately changing the branding on its website to reflect the new name.House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters that legislative action was needed, “and we’re going to make that clear.” The New York Democrat is an ex officio member of the board because of his position in Congress.“The Kennedy Center Board of Trustees voted unanimously today to name the institution the Donald J.Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts,” said Roma Daravi, the institution’s public relations vice-president.She said the vote recognised that Trump saved the centre from “financial ruin and physical destruction,” a pair of claims denied by the venue’s ousted leadership. “The new Trump Kennedy Center reflects the unequivocal bipartisan support for America’s cultural centre for generations to come,” Daravi said.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced the vote on social media, attributing it to the “unbelievable work” Trump has done on the centre since he returned to office in January.Trump, a Republican who chairs the board, said at the White House that he was “surprised” and “honoured” by the vote. “The board is a very distinguished board, most distinguished people in the country and I was surprised by it and I was honoured by it,” he said.Trump had already been referring to the centre as the “Trump Kennedy Center.” Asked December 7 as he walked the red carpet for the Kennedy Center Honors programme whether he would rename the venue after himself, Trump said such a decision would be up to the board.Earlier this month, Trump talked about a “big event” happening at the “Trump Kennedy Center” before saying, “excuse me, at the Kennedy Center,” as his audience laughed. He was referring to the FIFA World Cup soccer draw for 2026, in which he participated.A name change isn’t sitting well with some Kennedy family members.JFK family reactsJack Schlossberg, President John F. Kennedy’s grandson, wrote on X, ""Microphones were muted and the board meeting and vote NOT unanimous.""The Democrat suggested that Trump was ""explicitly motivated to act"" due to his New York congressional campaign, adding: ""Our campaign represents everything Trump can't stand or defeat.""Former Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.), grandson of former Attorney General and assassinated presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, posted on his social media accounts: ""The Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law. It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says.""","Congress named the Kennedy Center in 1964, following President John F.

Providence police issued an arrest warrant for the suspect in a mass shooting at Brown University that killed two people and injured nine, sources close to the investigation told CBS News.The large law enforcement are present in Salem, New Hampshire, according to video and aerials from NBC Boston, which is believed to be in connection with the ongoing investigation into the Brown University shooting, as they are searching for the individual and a rental car believed to have been used by the suspect.Authorities have not publicly identified the person.According to the aerial video from NBC Boston, some law enforcement members could be seen with guns drawn and pointed toward the building.As per social media, the officers are in Salem where the suspected shooter’s ABANDONED car was found near a storage facilityInvestigators are also examining a possible link between the university shooting and the killing of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology nuclear science and engineering professor two days later.The search entered its sixth day, with officers knocking on doors, requesting home-security videos and appealing to the public for tips to locate the gunman.A news conference planned for Thursday afternoon by Providence police was abruptly cancelled, though officials said they expected to provide an update later in the day.On Thursday, authorities told CBS sources they were probing connections between the Brown University shooting and the death of Nuno F Gomes Loureiro, 47, from Portugal, who was shot “multiple times” on Monday at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, about 80 km from Providence.Police have obtained an arrest warrant for a suspect, sources said. They added that a rental car matching the same description was seen at both crime scenes. Federal authorities had previously said there was no link between the murders.On Wednesday, investigators released a photo of an individual believed to have been in close proximity to their primary person of interest. Providence Police Chief Oscar Perez said they wanted to speak with the person, “who may have information relevant to the investigation”. He added that the killer “could be anywhere” and “we don’t know where the person is or who he is”.A day earlier, police showed footage of a person of interest in a black mask walking around the university campus, possibly “casing” the area before the crime, Perez said.Members of the public have expressed frustration over the investigation’s slow progress. In response, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said he believed the killer would be caught “and it is just a matter of time before we catch him”.The FBI has offered a $50,000 (£37,350) reward for information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of the person responsible for the attack.The shooting occurred at Brown University’s Barus & Holley engineering building during final exams. Authorities identified the two students killed as Ella Cook, a sophomore from Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, an Uzbek-American freshman.","Police have obtained an arrest warrant for a suspect, sources said.

‘First casualty of the fusion wars’: Killing of MIT’s top nuclear scientist Nuno Loureiro sparks online speculation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/first-casualty-of-the-fusion-wars-killing-of-mits-top-nuclear-scientist-nuno-loureiro-sparks-online-speculation/articleshow/126064676.cms,"Wave of online speculation after the scientist’s death

Why fusion research draws intense attention

Who was Nuno Loureiro

What police have said so far





The killing of Nuno Loureiro, a leading nuclear fusion scientist and director of MIT ’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, has shocked the global scientific community and fuelled a wave of online speculation about possible motives. Loureiro, 47, was shot and killed at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, on December 15, 2025. Police have confirmed the death as a homicide and say the investigation remains ongoing, with no suspects or motive publicly identified. In the absence of official details, social media has rapidly filled the information vacuum with theories linking his death to the high-stakes global race for fusion energy.Soon after news of Loureiro’s death emerged, social media platforms were flooded with speculative and often contradictory claims attempting to explain the killing in the absence of official details. Some users framed him as the “first casualty of the fusion wars,” arguing that his work on nuclear fusion threatened entrenched energy industries, particularly fossil fuel companies, by accelerating the path toward a cleaner, long-term alternative. Others extended this narrative to include renewable energy sectors, claiming that large-scale fusion could eventually disrupt existing wind and solar investment models.A separate strain of speculation focused on geopolitics. These posts suggested that foreign governments competing in the global race for next-generation energy technologies, including nuclear fusion, may have viewed Loureiro’s research as strategically significant. In these narratives, fusion was portrayed not just as a scientific goal but as a future source of economic and geopolitical power. Some posts went further by alleging state-level interference or industrial espionage.Other viral posts asserted that Loureiro was close to a major scientific breakthrough that could have rapidly accelerated the commercial viability of fusion energy.Authorities have repeatedly stated that there is no evidence at this stage connecting Loureiro’s research, industry interests, or geopolitical competition to his killing. Law enforcement officials have not identified a motive, named suspects, or suggested that his professional work played any role in the homicide. As a result, all such theories remain unverified online speculation rather than conclusions supported by facts.Fusion energy is often portrayed as a future solution to climate change and global energy security, offering power without carbon emissions and minimal long-lived radioactive waste. While progress has been significant, experts stress that fusion remains a long-term scientific challenge involving international collaboration across universities, national laboratories and private companies. No single scientist or institution can determine the pace or outcome of fusion development.Loureiro was an internationally respected plasma physicist who spent more than a decade at MIT working on some of the most difficult problems in nuclear fusion. As director of the Plasma Science and Fusion Center, he led research into turbulence and magnetic reconnection in plasmas, key challenges for making fusion reactors stable and efficient. Colleagues widely regarded him as a rare combination of deep theoretical thinker and gifted teacher.Law enforcement officials have confirmed that Loureiro died from a gunshot wound and that the case is being investigated as a homicide. No arrests have been made, and police have not released details about potential suspects or motives. Investigators have urged caution as the inquiry continues and have warned against drawing conclusions without verified evidence.Beyond the speculation, Loureiro’s death is being mourned as a major loss to science and education. Students and colleagues remember him for his generosity, mentorship and ability to make complex physics accessible. For many young Portuguese scientists, he was a powerful role model who showed that it was possible to rise from familiar classrooms to the forefront of global research.","Nuno Loureiro was a leading nuclear fusion scientist and director of MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center.

Greg Biffle and his family were reportedly killed after their private jet in which they were flying from North Carolina to Florida crashed, shortly after takeoff from Statesville Regional Airport. The video of the plane crash with fire and smoke coming out of the crash site emerged first when the local authorities confirmed the crash and multiple fatalities. Later, the Cessna C550 was linked with semir-retired professional car racer Greg Biffle.Before the official confirmation from any authorities concerned, YouTuber and his family friend Garrett Mitchell shared the shocking update on social media that all family members of Greg were killed in the crash. Mitchell said they were flying to Florida to spend the afternoon with the Mitchells.""Unfortunately, I can confirm Greg Biffle, his wife Cristina, daughter Emma, and son Ryder were on that plane… because they were on their way to spend the afternoon with us,"" Mitchell, who posts under the pseudonym Cleetus McFarland, said in a Facebook post. ""We are devastated. I’m so sorry to share this.""The crash was reported around 10.15am at the airport from where the plane took off a short while ago.The plane was returning to the airport for some emergency, which is not known yet. “Like we said, at approximately 10:15 a.m., we got a report of a jet that crashed off the end of the runway on the east end. By time I came out, it was fully engulfed. We’ve had multiple agencies that have come. The FAA arrived at about 12 o’clock today,"" airport manager John Ferguson said.According to FlightAware tracking, the plane with the tag N257BW took off from Statesville Regional Airport with a destination of Sarasota/Bradenton International Airport in Florida. The plane was scheduled to be in Florida for less than an hour, before heading to Treasure Cay in the Bahamas. It was then scheduled to head to Fort Lauderdale, before returning to Statesville at a scheduled arrival time of 8:22 pm.The flight path of the ill-fated Cessna 550 Citation showed that it had taken off, the plane immediately turned around and tried to land. It crashed on the landing attempt back at the airport.“Adverse weather conditions were reported in the vicinity of Statesville Regional Airport around the time of the plane crash. Heavy drizzle and a cloud ceiling near 1,200 feet were reported at 10:15 a.m. The cloud ceiling had reportedly lowered to around 400 feet, with heavy rain reducing visibility to less than 2 miles at 10:30 a.m. Weather conditions are often a critical factor that investigators carefully review after a plane crash. It may take months to a year or longer for investigators to determine if the weather conditions contributed to the crash,"" the update from AccuWeather reported.But it is not known why the plane was coming back to the original airport.Biffle and Cristina were married in January of 2023, and their son Ryder was born in September of 2020.

Katie Miller's college shenanigans



Katie Miller's MAGA career







While you might have heard of Katie Miller before, in the past few days, she has been more likely to pop up on your screens. Wife of United States Homeland Security Advisor, Katie Miller is a MAGA woman just rising in fame.The 34-year-old recently went viral for her explosive interview with FBI chief Kash Patel and his country music star girlfriend Alexis Wilkins on her podcast, 'The Katie Miller Podcast' While Americans were already not impressed by her digital gig, inviting one of the most controversial MAGA couples to the couch put her a few more notches down in the digital domain.But as she goes viral with her attempt to create a new identity after some political gigs, some of her past classmates seem to be outing her previous Mean Girls personality.Miller, had a reputation for questionable behaviour even before she married her husband in 2020. It was back when she was Katie Waldman, daughter of Glenn and Sheryl Waldman.Residing in an upscale neighbourhood in Florida, Katie was 15 when she was studying at Cypress Bay High School in Broward County. A former classmate recalled being shocked by Miller's answer when they were asked to give a speech about themselves.“She got up and said, ‘My father is a litigator, and my mom is a MILF. She does nothing but drive up and down the highway in her SUV until it’s time to pick me up from school,’” the former classmate told Slate “What she meant was, ‘My dad is a rich guy, and my mom’s hot. That’s who I am, and that’s where I come from.’ She was super proud,” they added.Others remembered her as a person hungry for social status. “She was someone who was very interested in befriending others for status, more so than being a friend,” one classmate recalled. “She would drift towards whoever was in control or popular or whatever. A friend to many, but not really a good friend to any.”Miller donned Juicy Couture tracksuits, the popular high school girl uniform, others said. Ryan Terrell, the captain of the debate team who coached Miller for a semester described her as “a teenage girl from an upper-income family in a wealthy neighbourhood. She kind of talked like that, just without the California accent.”Miller also worked as a photo editor for the student newspaper, the Circuit. The entertainment editor of the paper at the time, Emmi Weiner, told the outlet that she is not surprised by Miller's divisive personality as she had form for it even then. “You’re never surprised when you hear about something bad that Katie Waldman did,” she said.It seems Miller carried the Regina George persona to college as well. During her days at the University of Florida, she operated like a ""henchman"" after joining the ruling party in the university's student government, a former student recalled.“She looked down on people she didn’t agree with,” said Jordan Ball, a member of the opposition party at the time.In 2012, on the day of the student elections, Miller and a pal were reportedly caught dumping over 250 copies of a student paper with a front-page endorsement for the opposition party.“Especially after stealing the newspapers, she had a reputation, not just with us, but throughout the whole school, of being unethical,” said Ford Dwyer, a senator for the opposition party.“The sense that everyone got was that they’d better all be careful or else, because she had information on them, and she better be respected because she had secrets that she might or might not reveal,” Dwyer recalled.After graduating from the University of Florida, Miller got a master's in public administration from George Washington University. During Trump's first term, she served as his special assistant as well as press secretary to then-Vice President Mike Pence. She also worked as a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security.It was in 2020 that Katie got hitched to Stephen Miller at the Trump Hotel in Washington. While they knew each other through work, they were introduced to each other through friends in 2018.Post her marriage, she also worked as an advisor for Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. And in August 2025, Miller launched her very own podcast from her living room, The Katie Miller Show, a weekly podcast for conservative women.Whatever intent she may have had with the podcast, it has failed to reach the hearts of the Americans, who think of it as just another MAGA woman trying to find a space to trend. Additionally, with the controversies surrounding her and her past behaviour being revealed, it seems she is in need of a podcast appearance herself.","Katie Miller, 34, is the wife of U.S. Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller.

Pope Leo XIV: Inside the Conclave and the Dawn of a New Papacy





Pope Leo XIV has named Bishop Ronald A. Hicks as the next Archbishop of New York, placing one of the United States’ most influential Catholic archdioceses under new leadership at a moment of institutional transition and political strain.Hicks, 58, currently serves as bishop of Joliet, Illinois. He replaces Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who submitted his resignation earlier this year after turning 75, as required under Vatican rules. The appointment, announced in Vatican City on Thursday, is the most significant US posting made so far by Leo, the first American pope.The New York archdiocese serves roughly 2.5 million Catholics across Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island and seven surrounding counties. Hicks inherits leadership as the archdiocese begins implementing a $300 million settlement fund for survivors of clerical sexual abuse, finalised by Dolan shortly before his retirement.Speaking at a news conference following the announcement, Hicks addressed the settlement directly.“As a church, we can never rest in our efforts to prevent abuse, to protect children and to care for survivors,” he said. “While this work is challenging, it’s difficult, it’s painful, I hope it will continue to help in the areas of accountability, transparency and healing.”The fund is intended to cover settlements for most, if not all, of the approximately 1,300 outstanding abuse claims against the archdiocese. It will be financed through budget reductions and the sale of church assets.Dolan had delayed stepping aside while the settlement framework was completed. Vatican practice often allows outgoing bishops to remain in place when abuse litigation or governance issues are unresolved.The leadership change also marks a generational shift. Dolan, a high-profile conservative figure, was a dominant public presence in New York and a prominent voice in national Catholic debates. His tenure included close ties to Republican political figures, including Donald Trump, who appointed him to a Religious Liberty Commission and invited him to pray at his inauguration.Hicks arrives with a different profile. Like Leo, he is Chicago-born and has spent significant time working in Latin America. From 2005 to 2010, he served in El Salvador as regional director of, a church-run programme supporting orphaned and abandoned children across Latin America and the Caribbean.He has also publicly aligned with US bishops critical of the Trump administration’s immigration policies. In November, Hicks endorsed a statement from the US Conference of Catholic Bishops condemning immigration raids, particularly those affecting Chicago.The message, he said at the time, “affirms our solidarity with all our brothers and sisters as it expresses our concerns, opposition, and hopes with clarity and conviction. It is grounded in the church’s enduring commitment to the Catholic social teaching of human dignity and a call for meaningful immigration reform.”Hicks acknowledged his shared background with the pope during interviews following Leo’s election. He said the two men met in person only in 2024, when then-Cardinal Robert Prevost visited one of his parishes in Illinois.“We grew up literally in the same radius, in the same neighbourhood together,” Hicks told Chicago’s WGN-TV. “We played in the same parks, went swimming in the same pools, like the same pizza places.”Christopher White, author of, said the similarities matter.“He won’t be shy, and at the same time he will also bring a seriousness and willingness to learn that’s likely to help him on a local level,” White said. “It will be different from Dolan’s larger-than-life persona.”Hicks was ordained a priest in Chicago, later serving as dean of formation at Mundelein Seminary before being appointed vicar general of the Archdiocese of Chicago in 2015 by Cardinal Blase Cupich. He became an auxiliary bishop in 2018 and was named bishop of Joliet by Pope Francis in 2020.His experience includes navigating the fallout from a 2023 Illinois attorney general’s report documenting decades of clerical abuse across the state. While the report criticised past diocesan leadership, it noted improvements in safeguarding practices during Hicks’s tenure.Dolan, for his part, welcomed the appointment publicly.“I already love him and appreciate him and trust him,” Dolan said, adding that Hicks was “an early Christmas gift” for the archdiocese.Hicks, standing in St Patrick’s Cathedral as archbishop-designate, struck a measured note.“I accept this appointment with humility and an open heart,” he said. “I ask for your support and your prayers.”He now assumes leadership of a church confronting its past, managing financial redress, and redefining its public voice under the first American pope.","Hicks, 58, currently serves as bishop of Joliet, Illinois.

The small plane that crashed Thursday while attempting a landing at North Carolina's Statesville Regional Airport was owned by Greg Biffle, a former NASCAR driver who won 19 Cup Series races in his 20-year career. FAA records show that the plane, a Cessna C550 with the tail number N257BW, is registered to an LLC called GB Aviation Leasing. Flight data shows that the plane took off from the Statesville airport before quickly returning for the attempted landing.No information about the pilot or who were on board has been released as of now.

‘Might Never See Him Again’: Imran Khan’s Sons Claim 'Psychological Torture' In Pak's Adiala Jail





Pakistan police on Wednesday registered a case under the Anti-Terrorism Act against the sisters of former prime minister Imran Khan and dozens of his supporters after a protest sit-in outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.The protest on Tuesday was held after authorities refused to allow family members and lawyers to meet Khan, who is currently incarcerated. His sisters, along with leaders and workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), staged the sit-in outside the jail to protest the restriction.Police said a first information report (FIR) was lodged at Police Station Saddar Beroni, Rawalpindi, naming Khan’s sisters Aleema Khan and Noreen Niazi, as well as several PTI leaders and supporters. Those named include Salman Akram Raja, Naeem Panjotha, Qasim Khan, Aliya Hamza and Raja Nasir Abbas.Authorities also invoked Section 120 of the Pakistan Penal Code for alleged criminal conspiracy against the state, along with charges of attacking police personnel and violating Section 144.Police said, as reported by PTI, at least 14 suspects were arrested at the scene late Tuesday night, and efforts are continuing to arrest others named in the FIR.Imran Khan has been in jail since August 2023 and faces multiple cases filed after his removal from office in April 2022.Officials have placed restrictions on meetings with Khan, saying such visits are being used for political purposes. The last meeting with him took place on December 2, when his sister Uzma Khan was allowed to see him.","Police register a case against the sisters of former prime minister Imran Khan and dozens of his supporters after a protest sit-in outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

'Pressure to deliver'

Munir's unprecedented power

Risks at home





Pakistan's de facto state head and most powerful army chief in decades is facing the toughest test of his expanding stronghold in Islamabad power centre as the United States presses Islamabad to send troops to a Gaza stabilisation force, a move analysts told Reuters could spark strong domestic backlash. It could also ""annoy the US president"" if Munir shows disinterest in contributing to the peace plan.Military chief Munir, who holds enormous influenceover Pakistan's political and economic decisions, is expected to travel to Washington in the coming weeks to meet US President Donald Trump . It would be their third meeting in six months and is likely to focus on Pakistan's possible role in Gaza, according to two sources familiar with the matter, one of whom is closely involved in Munir’s economic outreach to the US.Trump's proposed 20-point plan for Gaza calls for troops from Muslim-majority countries to oversee a transition period focused on reconstruction and economic recovery in the Palestinian territory. Gaza has been devastated by more than two years of Israeli military bombardment.Many countries are cautious about joining such a force because it could involve disarming Hamas, Gaza's Islamist militant group. Analysts say this risks pulling foreign troops deeper into the conflict and could inflame pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli public opinion at home.Munir, however, has developed close ties with Trump as part of an effort to repair years of strained relations between Washington and Islamabad. In June, Trump hosted Munir for a private lunch at the White House — the first time a US president met Pakistan’s army chief alone, without any civilian leaders present.""Not contributing (to the Gaza stabilisation force) could annoy Trump, which is no small matter for a Pakistani state that appears quite keen to remain in his good graces - in great part to secure U.S. investment and security aid,"" said Michael Kugelman, Senior Fellow, South Asia at the Washington-based Atlantic Council.Pakistan is the world's only Muslim-majority country with nuclear weapons and has a powerful, experienced military. It has fought three wars with rival India, a brief conflict earlier this year, and has long battled insurgencies in its remote regions. It is also currently fighting Islamist militants that it says operate from neighbouring Afghanistan.Because of this military capability, expectations are higher for Pakistan to contribute, said defence analyst and author Ayesha Siddiqa.Pakistan’s military strength means ""there is a greater pressure on Munir to deliver his capacity,"" she said.Pakistan’s military, foreign office and information ministry did not respond to Reuters’ questions. The White House also did not reply to a request for comment.Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said last month that Pakistan could consider contributing troops for peacekeeping, but made clear that disarming Hamas was not Islamabad’s responsibility.Earlier this month, Munir was appointed chief of the defence forces, placing the army, air force and navy under his command. He also received a job extension until 2030.Under constitutional amendments passed by Pakistan’s civilian government last month, Munir will retain his field marshal rank for life and enjoy lifetime immunity from criminal prosecution.""Few people in Pakistan enjoy the luxury of being able to take risks more than Munir. He has unbridled power, now constitutionally protected,"" Kugelman said.In recent weeks, Munir has met leaders from Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt and Qatar, according to military statements. Siddiqa said these meetings appear aimed at consulting Muslim countries on the proposed Gaza force.At home, however, the biggest risk is political unrest. Any deployment of Pakistani troops to Gaza under a US-backed plan could revive protests by Islamist parties that strongly oppose the US and Israel.These groups have the ability to bring thousands of supporters onto the streets.In October, authorities banned a powerful and violent Islamist party known for pushing Pakistan’s strict blasphemy laws. Officials said its leaders were arrested, more than 1,500 supporters detained, and its assets and bank accounts seized. Despite the ban, analysts say the group’s ideology still has influence.Supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, whose party won the most seats in the 2024 elections, are also deeply hostile to Munir and could mobilise against him.Abdul Basit, Senior Associate Fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, warned that any escalation after deployment could quickly spiral.""People will say 'Asim Munir is doing Israel's bidding' - it will be foolhardy of anyone not to see it coming.""",Pakistan's de facto state head and most powerful army chief in decades is facing the toughest test of his expanding stronghold in Islamabad power centre.
