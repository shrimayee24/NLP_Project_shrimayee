'Perspective based on reality': India after Nawaz Sharif admits Pakistan violated pact with India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/perspective-based-on-reality-india-after-nawaz-sharif-admits-pakistan-violated-pact-with-india/articleshow/110566474.cms,"NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Thursday responded to former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif 's admission that Islamabad ""violated"" 1999 Lahore Declaration signed between the two countries.During its weekly press briefing, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""You are aware of our position on the issue. It is true that even in Pakistan now a perspective based on reality is coming to the fore.""India's comment came a day after Nawaz Sharif said that Pakistan ""violated"" the agreement signed between him and his Indian counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1999 which was followed by the Kargil war.""On May 28, 1998, Pakistan carried out five nuclear tests .

China deploys J-20 stealth fighters at Tibet airfield,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/china-deploys-j-20-stealth-fighters-at-tibet-airfield/articleshow/110574443.cms,"NEW DELHI: China has now deployed its most advanced J-20 stealth fighters at an airfield in Tibet in the eastern sector facing India, amid the continuing military confrontation along the entire Line of Actual Control, which is into its fifth year now.Latest commercial satellite imagery shows the People’s Liberation Army-Air Force (PLAAF) has deployed six J-20 fighters at the Shigatse dual-use airport, which is barely 155 km from the LAC and close to Doklam near the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet tri-junction, in addition to the several J-10 jets and a KJ-500 AEW&C (airborne early-warning and control) aircraft already present there.“Multiple (satellite) images collected over the course of the same day indicate these aircraft (J-20s) arrived at the air base on May 27, preceded by the arrival of a Y-20 transport aircraft for the probable deployment of ground crew and support equipment,” said All Source Analysis, which looks at geospatial intelligence, in a post on “X”.A senior Indian defence establishment official, in turn, told TOI that the twin-engine J-20 fighters “are probably at Shigatse for high-altitude trials”. The PLAAF has been regularly deploying J-20s at its airfields in the western sector like the Hotan airfield in Xinjiang, which is around 240-km from the LAC, since the military confrontation erupted in eastern Ladakh in May 2020, as was earlier reported by TOI.Apart from the Sukhoi-30MKI fighters based at Hasimara, Chabua and Tezpur in the eastern sector, the IAF also has a squadron (18 jets) of its latest French-origin Rafale omni-role jets deployed at the Hasimara air base in West Bengal, with the other one at Ambala for the western front with Pakistan.China touts the Chengdu J-20 as the effective answer to the world’s only fully-operational and proven fifth-generation jets like the American F/A-22 Raptors and F-35 Lightning-II Joint Strike Fighters.TOI on April 29 had reported in detail about how China was continuing to build border infrastructure and dual-use ‘Xiaokang’ villages, strengthen military positions and deploy additional aircraft at its air-bases facing India, in all the three sectors of the 3,488-km LAC stretching from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh.China has now offset some of its air combat disadvantage due to high-altitude terrain constraints by deploying additional fighters, bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones after upgrading its airfields like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi and Hoping, among others. China has constructed new runways as well as extended older ones, along with building new hardened shelters, fuel and ammunition storage facilities at these airfields.At Hotan, for instance, the PLAAF recently deployed two new JH-7A fighter-bombers and three Y-20 heavy-lift aircraft, among others, to add to the almost 50 J-11 and J-7 fighters, five Y-8 and Y-7 transport aircraft and KJ-500 AEW&C aircraft already present there.","China has now deployed its most advanced J-20 stealth fighters at an airfield in Tibet in the eastern sector facing India.

Madhya Pradesh HC: Special Marriage Act won't legalise a union prohibited under personal law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/madhya-pradesh-hc-special-marriage-act-wont-legalise-a-union-prohibited-under-personal-law/articleshow/110574038.cms,"BHOPAL/JABALPUR: Madhya Pradesh HC has ruled that marriage between a Muslim man and a Hindu woman is an ""irregular (Fasid)"" marriage according to Muslim personal law and it remains so even if the marriage is performed under Special Marriage Act .""Marriage under Special Marriage Act would not legalise the marriage, which is otherwise prohibited under Muslim personal law. Sec 4 of Special Marriage Act provides that if the parties are not within a prohibited relationship then only marriage can be performed,"" Justice G S Ahluwalia said in a May 27 judgment in response to a petition filed by a Muslim man and a Hindu woman who had applied for marriage under Special Marriage Act, and pleaded with the court to provide police protection because the woman's father objected to the marriage.HC turned down the protection request, and said: ""It is clear the marriage of a Hindu female with a Muslim male is not a regular or valid (Sahih) marriage, but merely an irregular (Fasid) marriage.""The couple's counsel, Dinesh Upadhyay, told the high court that neither of them wanted to convert. Upadhyay argued that Special Marriage Act would override personal law, therefore marriage of a Muslim boy with a Hindu girl would not be an ' irregular marriage '.In response, Justice Ahluwalia said, ""Under personal law, performance of certain rituals are necessary for solemnization of marriage. However, if marriage is performed under Special Marriage Act, such marriage cannot be challenged on ground of non-performance of such mandatory rituals. But marriage under Special Marriage Act wouldn't legalise the marriage which otherwise is prohibited under personal law.""Quoting from the Mulla Principles of Mahomedan Law 21st edition, the judge said, ""A Muslim male may contract a valid marriage not only with a Muslim woman, but also with a Kitabia, that is a Jewess or a Christian, but not with an idolatress or a fire-worshipper. A marriage, however, with an idolatress or a fire-worshipper, is not void, but merely irregular.""Similarly, a Muslim woman cannot contract a valid marriage, except with a Muslim male, the judge explained.","Madhya Pradesh HC has ruled that marriage between a Muslim man and a Hindu woman is an ""irregular (Fasid)"" marriage according to Muslim personal law. The couple's counsel, Dinesh Upadhyay, told the high court that neither of them wanted to convert.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110574367,imgsize-18040,width-400,resizemode-4/110574367.jpg"
Shocking twist: Mother swapped her blood for son’s in Pune Porsche crash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/shocking-twist-mother-substitutes-her-blood-for-sons-in-pune-porsche-crash/articleshow/110553180.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a shocking development in the Pune Porsche accident case that claimed the lives of two techies, according to TV reports, the blood sample of the accused teenager, which was meant for an alcohol test, was swapped with his mother's sample.The crime branch on Monday arrested two doctors at govt-run Sassoon General Hospital — forensic sciences department head Dr Ajay Taware and casualty medical officer Dr Shrihari Halnor — and a staffer from the mortuary on charges of switching the blood sample of the teen involved in the May 19 accident.The police said the trio acted at the behest of the underage car driver’s father, a city builder, through a ‘middleman’ to manipulate the report that would confirm if the 17-year-old was under the influence of alcohol when he crashed a Porsche Taycan into a motorcycle, killing two techies.The arrests came after the police received the minor’s blood sample reports from Sassoon hospital and an Aundh-based hospital, both of which came negative for alcohol content in blood, and got reports of the minor and his father’s DNA fingerprinting from the forensic sciences laboratory.“Our investigation revealed that after the accident, the builder hired a middleman (who is yet to be identified) to get in touch with Ghatkamble and the latter then facilitated the builder’s contact with Taware around 10am on May 19. A scrutiny of the builder’s phone, seized from his bungalow, showed that he made one regular call to Taware and later used an application to make 20 more calls,” said Pune police commissioner Amitesh Kumar.Casualty medical officer Dr Shrihari Halnor admitted that he had received Rs 3 lakh from Taware. It was Halnor who discarded the minor's blood sample in a dustbin and replaced it with the blood sample of his mother.","The blood sample of the accused teenager, which was meant for an alcohol test, was swapped with his mother's sample.

North Korea's Kim supervises firing drills simulating preemptive attacks on South Korea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-koreas-kim-supervises-firing-drills-simulating-preemptive-attacks-on-south-korea/articleshow/110578335.cms,"NEW DELHI: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw firing drills involving nuclear-capable ""super-large"" multiple rocket launchers. The state media on Friday reported that these drills were intended to demonstrate North Korea 's capability for preemptive attacks on neighbouring South Korea .These firing exercises seem to refer to what South Korea identified as a barrage of ballistic missile test-launches conducted by North Korea on Thursday. Experts highlight that North Korea's large artillery rockets blur the lines between artillery systems and short-range ballistic missiles . This is because they generate their own thrust and are guided during flight.The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported that the recent weapons tests are a clear indication of North Korea's determination to carry out a preemptive strike on South Korea if it feels threatened. Kim Jong Un stated that these drills ""will serve as an occasion in clearly showing what consequences our rivals will face if they provoke us.""KCNA accused South Korea of staging a ""clumsy counteraction of dangerous armed demonstration against the exercise of legitimate sovereign right"" of North Korea. This accusation was in reference to a South Korean aerial exercise conducted just hours before North Korea's unsuccessful spy satellite launch on Monday night. Had it succeeded, North Korea would have placed its second spy satellite into orbit.The multiple rocket launchers are a significant part of North Korea's arsenal aimed at South Korea. North Korea claims that the weapons fired from these launchers can carry tactical nuclear warheads.State media photos showed Kim Jong Un observing at least 18 projectiles being launched from trucks. South Korea's military had earlier reported that North Korea fired about 10 suspected ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast.The unsuccessful spy satellite launch by North Korea was strongly condemned by the US, South Korea, and others. The UN bans any satellite launches by North Korea, viewing them as a front for testing missile technologies. However, North Korea insists it has the right to conduct satellite launches and missile tests.In recent times, North Korea has been actively conducting weapons tests to enhance its nuclear capabilities, addressing what it perceives as growing US military threats. Foreign experts believe that North Korea aims to use its expanded nuclear arsenal to gain greater concessions from the US in future diplomatic engagements.(With inputs from agencies)","North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw firing drills involving nuclear-capable ""super-large"" multiple rocket launchers.

"Biden allows Ukraine limited use of US arms to strike inside Russia, say US officials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-allows-ukraine-limited-use-of-us-arms-to-strike-inside-russia-say-us-officials/articleshow/110578404.cms,"WASHINGTON/PRAGUE: President Joe Biden quietly has authorized Kyiv to launch US-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia that are supporting an offensive against the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv , four US officials said on Thursday.The decision marks a policy shift by Biden, who had steadfastly refused to allow Ukraine to use American weaponry for strikes inside Russia.Russia's embassy in Washington and Russia's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Biden's decision applies only to targets inside Russia near the border with the Kharkiv region, where an offensive launched by Moscow on May 10 has overrun some villages.""The President recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,"" said one US official.Russia is building up forces near the northern part of the region, but it lacks the troop numbers to stage a major push, Ukraine's top commander said on Thursday.Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, is 19 miles (30 km) from the border with Russia.It is the second time this year that Biden has quietly relaxed his policy on weapons supplies for Ukraine, bending to calls to send long-range missiles known as ATACMS to Kyiv.""The Biden administration has come a long way from their hypersensitivity to and misunderstanding of the risk of escalation,"" said Alexander Vindman, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and former director for European affairs at the White House National Security Council under the Trump administration.He applauded the shift in Biden's policy, which he said ""unties Ukraine's hands.""""Of course it's the right move,"" Vindman said.The US is the biggest supplier of weapons to Ukraine in its battle against the full-scale invasion launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin in February 2022.The officials said that US policy would continue to prohibit the Ukrainian military from using ATACMS, which have a range of up to 186 miles (300 km), and other long-range US-supplied weapons for deep strikes inside Russia.Biden's decision also does not mean the US now approves of drone attacks that Ukraine has been launching against Russian petroleum facilities, they said.Some NATO allies and US lawmakers have been calling on Biden to relax the restriction on US weapons to allow Ukraine to strike missile launchers and other military sites inside Russia that are backing Moscow's drive toward Kharkiv.Russia jetfighters flying inside Russia out of reach of Ukrainian air defenses have been supporting the offensive by loosing highly precise glide bombs at Ukrainian defense lines and into Kharkiv, where they have caused numerous civilian casualties.Putin on Tuesday warned NATO members against allowing Ukraine to fire their weapons into Russia and he raised anew a risk of nuclear war.Some experts dismissed his remarks as bluster. They noted that Putin has failed to act on similar threats in the past and already has committed the bulk of his conventional forces to Europe's biggest land war since World War Two.""I don't think we can or should be bullied by Vladimir Putin,"" said US Representative Gerry Connolly, a Democratic member of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee. ""Is he really willing to risk nuclear war and a conflict with NATO?""Connolly co-signed a May 20 letter with Representative Michael Turner, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and other lawmakers urging the Biden administration to allow Ukraine to use US weapons to hit strategic targets inside Russia.For some time, critics have urged NATO allies to relax restrictions on use of their weapons against military targets inside Russia. Those voices have grown within the alliance since Russia launched the Kharkiv offensive.Countries that have called for relaxing restrictions or done so for their own arms sent to Ukraine include Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, the Baltic states, Finland, Denmark, Germany and France.Biden faced the potentially embarrassing prospect that as he hosts a NATO summit in July, Russian forces would be advancing on Kharkiv and in Ukraine's east as the alliance marks its 75th anniversary, analysts said.",Biden had steadfastly refused to allow Ukraine to use American weaponry for strikes inside Russia. The decision applies only to targets inside Russia near the border with the Kharkiv region.

'I'm gonna kill all the Jews': Pakistan immigrant attempts to run down kids outside NYC school,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/im-gonna-kill-all-the-jews-pakistan-immigrant-attempts-to-run-down-kids-outside-nyc-school/articleshow/110563431.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a shocking incident on Wednesday, an unhinged driver attempted to mow down Orthodox students and a rabbi outside a Brooklyn Jewish school while allegedly shouting, ""I'm gonna kill all the Jews"".Video footage from the Flatbush Shomrim Safety Patrol captures the driver revving his engine and mounting the curb as he swerved toward Orthodox Jews outside the Yeshiva in Canarsie around 11.25am.As per a New York Post report, the alleged attacker, identified as 58-year-old Asghar Ali, a Pakistani immigrant and cab driver with a history of mental illness, is currently under investigation by the NYPD's Hate Crimes Task Force. Detectives interviewed Ali on Wednesday night.Ali faces more than a dozen charges, including attempted murder , attempted assault, and hate crimes charges. Police do not believe the attack is terror-related and have not found evidence linking him to radical groups online.The attack began as Ali, driving a 2011 white Crown Victoria, turned onto East 55th Street in front of the Mesivta Nachlas Yakov School and suddenly veered toward students in Orthodox attire. He then circled the block and returned, targeting two more students and a rabbi.“I’m gonna kill all the Jews,” Ali allegedly shouted, according to police. The victims managed to run into the building before being struck. Fortunately, no one was hurt. Authorities have listed five victims in the case: three 18-year-olds, a 41-year-old man, and a 44-year-old man.Rabbi Twersky, who works at the Yeshiva, described the chaos as the driver attempted to strike one of the boys at the corner of Glenwood Road and East 55th Street. Ali then drove up the wrong side of East 56th Street and barreled toward a group of 30 to 40 students.“I’m much more scared than they are — their adrenaline is up,” Twersky said.Tire marks on the sidewalk near the Yeshiva remained visible Wednesday night, with a police car stationed outside. Ali initially got away but was quickly located by the Shomrim Safety Patrol, who swarmed the area and found the attacker at a nearby Dunkin' Donuts, the NY Post report said.“We were able to retrieve the video footage. We got the guy’s plate number,” said Bob Moskowitz, executive coordinator of the patrol. “Obviously it was a very distinct car, a Crown Vic, an old model. You don’t see too many of those around.”Ali, who has lived in the US for over two decades, was taken into custody and transferred to Coney Island Hospital. He is considered an “emotionally disturbed” person with a prior arrest in 1998 for false personation. He has four prior arrests, including one for criminal impersonation, though details of the other arrests were not immediately clear.“We were very pleased to be able to apprehend this individual,” Moskowitz stated. “This is not somebody that we want driving around the streets, especially with this anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish climate that’s out there. So we were glad to be able to put this to rest. The community was kind of uptight about this. Now everybody can be a little more relaxed.”","Asghar Ali, 58, a Pakistani immigrant and cab driver with a history of mental illness, is currently under investigation by the NYPD's Hate Crimes Task Force.

NEW DELHI: After huge criticism worldwide, Israel has now retaliated by sharing its own image, 'Where were your eyes', questioning why people did not post about the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 . This came after celebrities, public figures, and countless social media users shared the AI-generated 'All eyes on Rafah ' image to highlight Israel's air strikes in Rafah, a city in war-ravaged Gaza.The Israeli air strike , aimed at destroying Hamas, resulted in the deaths of at least 45 civilians, including children, at a refugee camp in Rafah. The incident has sparked global outrage, however, while facing widespread criticism, Israel denied targeting the Rafah camp, claiming that the damage was caused by a secondary fire resulting from a rocket striking a Hamas weapons facility.The image shared by Tel Aviv, in response, highlights the attack on October 7 that claimed the lives of approximately 1,160 people in Israel, primarily civilians. The militants also took around 250 hostages, many of whom were freed during a week-long truce in November. Israel believes that 99 hostages remain alive in the militants' custody, while 31 have perished.Israel's retaliatory military campaign to destroy Hamas has claimed at least 31,112 lives, according to the health ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza.The Israeli government , led by Benjamin Netanyahu , shared an image on X with the text ""Where were your eyes on October 7,"" depicting a Hamas militant standing in front of a baby.This response came shortly after the 'All eyes on Rafah' image went viral, with nearly 44 million users sharing it on Instagram. The image portrays densely packed rows of tents stretching across a desert landscape overshadowed by mountains, symbolizing the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who sought refuge there during Israel's military campaign against Hamas.Several Indian celebrities also shared the ""All eyes on Rafah"" image on their social media platforms.","The Israeli government shared an image on X with the text ""Where were your eyes on October 7,"" depicting a Hamas militant standing in front of a baby.

Former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif set to be re-elected as PML-N president after six years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/former-pakistan-pm-nawaz-sharif-set-to-be-re-elected-as-pml-n-president-after-six-years/articleshow/110488540.cms,"LAHORE: Three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif is set to be re-elected as the President of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) party here on Tuesday, six years after losing the post following a Supreme Court ruling in the Panama Papers case. The Dawn newspaper reported that the General Council meeting is set to take place at a local hotel. It is likely that the 74-year-old veteran politician, who returned to Pakistan in October last year after a four-year self-imposed exile in the UK, will be elected unopposed even though as many as 11 party members have received the nomination papers for the top post, the report said.The PML-N had earlier announced convening the general council meeting on May 11 but it was postponed to coincide with the celebration of 26 years of Pakistan becoming a nuclear power, the report said.PML-N Punjab president Rana Sanaullah, while addressing a press conference, hinted that the elder Sharif would be elected without a contest.Responding to a question if others were contesting against the former premier, Sanaullah said if any party member wanted to contest against him, they should come forward.When asked why the party didn't adopt a democratic process to vote for a new president, Sanaullah said the party was a ""servant of power corridors and it was Nawaz Sharif who made it a party of the public"". He added that after Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, it was Nawaz Sharif who ""made the party vibrant"".Replying to another question on why Nawaz Sharif wasn't active in politics after the February 8 general elections, Sanaullah said the former PM is not angry with anyone and he is active in the party. ""All major decisions of the party and government are taken by him,"" he added.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had earlier this month resigned as the PML-N president citing the ""unjust"" disqualification of the party supremo and his elder brother Nawaz Sharif from the PM Office.Shehbaz, 72, said that it was time for the latter to ""resume his rightful place as the president of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party.""The February 8 general elections had delivered a fractured mandate and the PML-N did not get a clear majority. It joined hands with the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) led by Bilawal Zardari Bhutto and other smaller parties to form the government at the federal level when Nawaz relinquished the post of prime minister in favour of Shehbaz.Much before that, in 2017, Nawaz had stepped down as the country's prime minister after the Supreme Court disqualified him for life from holding public office for not declaring a receivable salary.Following his trial in the Panama Papers case, the apex court, in February 2018, disqualified the PML-N supremo as the party's president.",Nawaz Sharif is set to be re-elected as the President of the ruling PML-N party.

Pakistan PM Shehbaz calls some judges 'black sheep'; accuses them of giving relief to Imran Khan



(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Taking a cue from former US president Donald Trump , former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan on Thursday claimed that the February national election was rigged , calling it the ""biggest robbery on public mandate.""Speaking to the Supreme Court via video link from Adyala jail in Rawalpindi, where he is being held in solitary confinement, Khan alleged that he and his party were subjected to ""gross human rights"" violations and were being ""victimised.""Despite Khan's party winning the most seats in the February election, they fell short of a majority, allowing his opponent Shehbaz Sharif to form a government with the support of allied parties. The top court granted Khan permission to appear and plead petitions he had filed against amendments to the country's anti-graft laws.The Pakistan Muslim League (N) secured 75 seats, the Pakistan People's Party came third with 54 seats, and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) has agreed to support them with 17 seats.Imran Khan's defense was similar to that of former US President Donald Trump who on several occasions has also claimed that the 2020 US elections were 'rigged' and 'stolen' by the democrats.Earlier today, a Pakistan court acquitted Imran Khan in two cases related to violence that occurred on May 9. The court cited a lack of sufficient evidence against the 71-year-old founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. The verdict was delivered by judicial magistrate Umar Shabbir of the district and sessions court of Islamabad, who approved the petition challenging the two cases filed at Shehzad Town police station.The court stated in its verdict: ""Because of insufficient evidence presented by the prosecution, the PTI founder has been acquitted.""Last year, following Khan's arrest in an alleged corruption case, his supporters engaged in vandalism targeting public property, including sensitive army installations. This is not the first time Khan has been acquitted in cases connected to the May 9 violence; on May 15, he was also cleared in two other related cases.Earlier, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday had accused some serving judges, whom he referred to as ""black sheep,"" of allegedly providing relief to Imran Khan in various cases.""Some black sheep in (the) judiciary are there to save Imran Niazi from 190 billion pounds and other cases. Every day, it is planned how to give him bail in certain cases,"" he said.Shehbaz made these allegations during a general council meeting of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), where his elder brother and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was re-elected as the party's president.","Imran Khan claims that the February national election was rigged, calling it the ""biggest robbery on public mandate"" Speaking to the Supreme Court via video link from Adyala jail in Rawalpindi, Khan alleged that he and his party were subjected to ""gross human rights"" violations.

'No one above the law': Biden hopes Trump verdict speaks for itself,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-one-above-the-law-biden-hopes-trump-verdict-speaks-for-itself/articleshow/110576814.cms,"WASHINGTON: If anyone expected Joe Biden and his election campaign to be celebrating Donald Trump's criminal conviction, they were disappointed.Instead Biden appears to be treading a fine line between reminding voters that his opponent is a convicted felon , while simultaneously keeping a presidential distance above the fray.His campaign stressed that Trump -- who has repeatedly claimed without evidence that the case was political -- remains a dangerous threat as he eyes a comeback to the White House .""In New York today, we saw that no one is above the law,"" Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler said in a statement.""Donald Trump has always mistakenly believed he would never face consequences for breaking the law for his own personal gain.""But today's verdict does not change the fact that the American people face a simple reality. There is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box.""The White House was even less keen to get its hands dirty after the former occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue was convicted on all 34 counts in his hush money case.""We respect the rule of law, and have no additional comment,"" Ian Sams, White House Counsel's Office spokesperson, said in a curt statement.From Biden himself there was no comment on Thursday.The president was at his home in Delaware on what was already a hugely significant day for him -- nine years to the day after his son Beau's death from brain cancer in 2015, aged 46.- 'Big deal' -In a normal US election year it would be game over if one's opponent was convicted in court, but 2024 is no normal campaign.Analysts said that while Trump's guilty verdict would energize his base of supporters and help him fundraise, it would be unlikely to significantly swing the dial in his favor.For his part, Biden will be hoping that the verdict can sway even a small number of independents or wavering voters who could be crucial in one of the closest White House races in living memory.""It helps Biden for this reason: I'm Joe Biden and I'm not a convicted felon,"" said Democratic strategist Rachel Bitecofer.But Biden will also be keen to avoid giving Trump ammunition for his baseless accusations that the trial was somehow ordered by the president.""These are uncharted waters,"" said David Karol, who teaches government and politics at the University of Maryland.""Definitely Democratic surrogates are going to talk about this a lot. For Biden it's a little trickier... he's wanted to avoid the impression that he is directing the prosecution of his opponent,"" Karol told AFP.Biden has largely avoided commenting on the case so far and will likely continue, instead letting Trump's conviction speak for itself, in an election that he's already framed as a fight for the future of American democracy.""I don't think this is the kind of thing that Biden needs to talk about to bring it to voters' attention. It's a big deal, it's historic,"" said Karol.But it may be hard for Biden -- who has previously joked about Trump falling asleep in his trial -- to resist any comment.Biden and Trump are due to face each other in their first televised debate on June 27 -- just over two weeks before Trump is set to be sentenced.""If they actually appear in a debate, I wouldn't be surprised if in the heat of the moment it comes up,"" said Karol.","Biden campaign stresses that Trump remains a dangerous threat as he eyes a comeback to the White House.

Hush money case: Former US President Donald Trump found guilty in New York criminal trial; sentencing set for July 11,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/former-us-president-donald-trump-held-guilty-in-new-york-criminal-trial/articleshow/110573549.cms,"NEW DELHI: Donald Trump was found guilty in a criminal trial on all 34 counts of falsifying documents to conceal a payment made to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.The trial judge has set the date of sentencing for July 11, days before the Republicans are scheduled to officially choose him as the 2024 election nominee.The core of the allegations revolves around payments made to Trump's previous attorney, Michael Cohen , as compensation for a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. The payment was made to ensure Daniels' silence regarding her alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump.According to the prosecution, the reimbursements were incorrectly recorded as ""legal expenses"" in an attempt to conceal the actual purpose of the transactions. The charges brought against Trump carry a potential sentence of up to four years in prison. However, Trump has maintained his innocence and pleaded not guilty.The decision is historic as Trump is the first US president to be found guilty of a crime. The verdict was reached after two days of deliberations by the 12-member jury.This development comes as Trump, the Republican candidate , prepares to challenge Democratic President Joe Biden in the upcoming November 5 presidential election . Despite denying any wrongdoing, Trump is expected to appeal the verdict. The maximum sentence for his crime is four years in prison, although lesser penalties such as fines or probation are more common. Incarceration would not prevent him from campaigning or taking office if elected.According to Reuters/Ipsos polling, the guilty verdict could potentially cost Trump support from independent and Republican voters in what is currently a close race between him and Biden. The jury's decision came after a five-week trial that included explicit testimony from porn star Stormy Daniels about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, which he denies.Trump's former fixer, Michael Cohen, testified that Trump approved a $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 election and a plan to reimburse Cohen through monthly payments disguised as legal work. Trump's lawyers questioned Cohen's credibility, highlighting his criminal record, imprisonment, and history of lying.Prosecutors in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office elevated the charge of falsifying business documents, normally a misdemeanor in New York , to a felony on the grounds that Trump was concealing an illegal campaign contribution. Trump complained that he could not receive a fair trial in his heavily Democratic hometown. This case, known as the ""zombie case"" because Bragg revived it after his predecessor chose not to bring charges, is considered the least consequential of the four criminal prosecutions Trump faces. It is also likely to be the only one to go to trial before the election, as the others are delayed by procedural challenges.If elected, Trump could potentially shut down the two federal cases accusing him of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election loss and mishandling classified documents after leaving office in 2021. However, he would not have the power to stop a separate election-subversion case taking place in Georgia. Trump has pleaded not guilty in all the cases and has portrayed his legal troubles as an effort by Biden's Democratic allies to harm him politically.(With agency inputs)","Donald Trump found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying documents to conceal a payment made to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.

Gen. Peter Elwelu, a former deputy chief of Uganda's military, was sanctioned over ""extrajudicial killings"" committed by government troops. Three former government ministers, recently implicated in the theft of roofing sheets that were not distributed to members of an impoverished community, were also sanctioned.Among, a senior member of Uganda's ruling party and an ally of President Yoweri Museveni, has been under the spotlight recently over the source of her wealth as well as allegations relating to the misuse of parliamentary resources. The United Kingdom announced sanctions against her last month, citing corruption.At the center of an ongoing probe ordered by the president, is whether Among owns property in the UK that she did not declare to authorities.The State Department statement said those sanctioned are barred from entering the US.Among's husband and lawmaker Moses Magogo was also sanctioned. He has been president of the Ugandan soccer federation since 2013. The next men's World Cup in 2026 is being co-hosted by the United States, with Canada and Mexico, and Magogo would have been be expected to attend the tournament.Ugandans have been stunned by the revelations about Among's spending. She has denied the allegations and has claimed she is the victim of a political witch hunt. She says she is being targeted for her role in enacting an anti-gay bill condemned by rights watchdogs and others.Elwelu and the other sanctioned Ugandans were not immediately available for comment. Elwelu appears to have been targeted for his role as the commander of a 2016 military attack on a tribal king's palace in which over 100 civilians were killed.Museveni, who has held power in Uganda since 1986, has long been accused of shielding corrupt but influential officials from criminal prosecution. After his reelection to a sixth term in 2021, he promised to crack down on corruption.But many Ugandans are not hopeful.Local media outlets frequently report on corruption issues, but activists, opposition figures and others who try to organize street protests face arrest under a law that requires them to first notify police of any plans to rally.","U.S. imposes sanctions on Uganda's parliamentary speaker, her husband and several other officials.

Hochstein has been working on a demarcation of the land border between the two countries that could have a number of phases.The first would be to allow for people in northern communities in Israel to return to their homes and those in southern communities in Lebanon to return to their homes, Hochstein said.Part of that would require a strengthening of the Lebanese armed forces, including recruiting, training and equipping forces, Hochstein said without detailing how that would happen.The second phase would involve an economic package for Lebanon, ""making sure that the international community demonstrates to the Lebanese people that we're invested in them.""Lebanon's power grid, for example, only operates a few hours per day, at an enormous detriment to its economy. ""We have a solution for that, we've put together a package that could create a solution that would take them to 12 hours of electricity in a short amount of time,"" Hochstein said.The last phase would be a land boundary agreement between Lebanon and Israel, he said.If politics and the economy are stabilized in Lebanon, it could help reduce Iran's influence there, he said.""The ability of outside forces of any consequence to influence Lebanon will diminish dramatically,"" Hochstein said.",A land border agreement between Israel and Lebanon implemented in phases could dampen the simmering and deadly conflict.

The group had been working with insurance companies to offer its members Carry Guard policies that covered losses caused by firearms, even when the insured person intentionally killed or hurt somebody. Critics have called the policies ""murder insurance.""In an unusual alignment, the NRA was represented in the case by the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Biden administration argued some of its claims should go forward.The high court ruling favoring the NRA reverses a lower-court decision tossing out the gun rights group 's lawsuit against Vullo. The decision means the NRA's lawsuit can go forward, but it does not decide the merits of the claim. It also should not be read to shield the NRA and other advocacy groups from regulation, Sotomayor said.But, she wrote, the NRA's complaint ""plausibly alleges that Vullo threatened to wield her power against those refusing to aid her campaign to punish the NRA's gun-promotion advocacy. If true, that violates the First Amendment.""Vullo argued that she rightly investigated NRA-endorsed insurance policies. She said she did speak out about the risks of doing business with gun groups but didn't exert any improper pressure on companies, many of which were distancing themselves from the NRA on their own at the time.The NRA said Vullo leveraged a state investigation into the legality of NRA-endorsed insurance products to pressure insurance companies, saying she would go easier on them if they cut ties with the group.The products clearly violated state law, Vullo said, including by covering intentional acts and criminal defense costs. The probe started before the Parkland massacre, which left 17 people dead, and the insurance providers ultimately agreed to pay $7 million and $1.3 million fines.Vullo also sent out guidance letters to banks and insurance companies warning about the ""reputational risks"" of working with the NRA. The NRA said her words had significant sway because of her position and several companies cut ties with the group, costing it millions of dollars in revenue.Vullo said the letters were evenhanded, and her attorney argued that letting the lawsuit go forward would improperly muzzle public officials.","NRA sued a former New York state official over claims she pressured companies to blacklist it.

And if the commission thinks she broke any laws, they can forward the information to prosecutors.A criminal investigation into whether Hill tampered with the Murdaugh jury or misused her office continues, the State Law Enforcement Division said Thursday.Hill resigned in March during the last year of her four year term, citing the public scrutiny of Murdaugh's trial and wanting to spend time with her grandchildren. She hasn't publicly addressed the ethics allegations and her lawyer didn't return a message Thursday.Murdaugh was convicted of killing his wife and younger son after a six-week trial in Colleton County last year. The case involved power, danger, money and privilege and an attorney whose family lorded over his small South Carolina county for nearly a century.Murdaugh is appealing his conviction and life without parole sentence in part accusing Hill of trying to influence jurors to vote guilty and being biased against Murdaugh for her book. Murdaugh is also serving decades in prison for admitting to stealing millions of dollars from settlements for clients who suffered horrible injuries or deaths and from his family's law firm.An initial appeal was denied, but the judge said she wasn't sure Hill told the truth about her dealings with jurors and was ""attracted by the siren call of celebrity.""The ethics allegations against Hill say she bought lunches for prosecutors and then paid herself back with county money. One count said she spent $543.89 for food and alcohol for a going away lunch for an employee in a local prosecutor's office.None of the allegations mention spending for public defenders or defense attorneys.Hill gave herself nearly $10,000 in bonuses from federal money that is meant to improve child support collection but has few rules on how it is spent, according to the complaint.The former clerk used public money to buy meals for her staff, her family, judges, court employees and others 36 times. She reimbursed herself for gifts bought for jurors and her staff on Valentine's Day and for her employees on Mother's Day, Father's Day and Easter, the complaint said.Expenses included $481 for a 50th birthday party for a staffer and dog food, bones and a pet bed for another, ethics officials said.In all, Hill is accused of spending nearly $20,000 in county money in ways she shouldn't, according to the complaint.","Former Colleton County Clerk of Court Becky Hill accused of giving herself bonuses and using county money to by dozens of lunches for her staff, prosecutors and a vendor.

NEW DELHI: A court in Pakistan has acquitted former Prime Minister Imran Khan in two cases related to the May 9 riots citing insufficient evidence.Khan's supporters, members of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, were involved in vandalizing public property, including sensitive army installations, following his arrest in an alleged corruption case.The acquittal was granted by Judicial Magistrate Umar Shabbir of the district and sessions court of Islamabad. The court in its verdict said, ""Because of insufficient evidence presented by the prosecution, the PTI founder has been acquitted.""Back on May 15, Khan was also acquitted in two other cases related to the May 9 incidents. Judicial Magistrate Sahib Bilal approved Khan's plea challenging those cases, which had been filed at the Khanna police station in Islamabad. These cases were related to the long march and the violation of Article 144.Following Khan's detention, a large number of his followers and PTI workers vandalized several military installations. Targets included the Jinnah House (Lahore Corps Commander House), Mianwali Airbase, and the ISI building in Faisalabad. For the first time, the Army headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi was also attacked by the mob.Despite these acquittals, Khan, who is held in the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, faces multiple allegations connected to the violence that erupted after his arrest.","Imran Khan was acquitted in two cases related to the May 9 riots citing insufficient evidence.

In a post on X, he said: “On this historic day in 1998, then-PM Nawaz Sharif demonstrated bold leadership by rejecting nerve-wracking pressures and inducements to make Pakistan a nuclear-armed nation.” He also paid tribute to ex-prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who, he said, was the founder of Pakistan’s nuclear programme, for his “strategic foresight and unwavering commitment to the cause”.Shehbaz was elected PML-N president in March 2018, months after the Supreme Court disqualified Nawaz for life in the Panama Papers case.

Meanwhile, the Labour party, led by former human rights lawyer Keir Starmer, is poised to capitalize on the opportunity to regain power after 14 years in opposition.The ruling Conservative party is not only trailing significantly behind Labour in the polls but also facing a mass exodus of parliamentarians. An unprecedented 129 MPs, including 77 Conservatives, have announced their decision not to seek re-election, reflecting the bleak prospects of victory for the governing party. Some Tory MPs have expressed frustration at being caught off guard by the July election date, with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Steve Baker opting to continue his vacation in Greece while preparing his campaign remotely.Despite Sunak's efforts to promote the Conservatives as the ""safe"" option during his campaign travels across the country, his campaign has encountered some early setbacks. A visit to the site where the Titanic was built drew comparisons between his leadership and captaining a sinking ship. Sunak's campaign has focused on appealing to older voters and right-wing supporters, with pledges to bring back national service and a substantial tax break for pensioners. However, these efforts have done little to boost the party's favor, with polls indicating a significant lead for Labour.Labour, on the other hand, is aiming to capitalize on the public's fatigue with the Conservatives, who have seen five prime ministers since 2016, along with numerous scandals and economic challenges. The party has sought to position itself as the ""natural party of business,"" garnering the support of 120 industry leaders this week. Under the leadership of Keir Starmer, Labour has shifted towards the center in an attempt to win back voters, including by expelling former leader Jeremy Corbyn and taking steps to address anti-Semitism within the party.However, the past week has also exposed long-standing factional divisions within Labour, with MP Diane Abbott expressing dismay at the party's desire to bar her from candidacy. Starmer has faced criticism from leftist voters who accuse him of backtracking on promises made during his successful leadership campaign. As the campaign progresses, both parties will need to navigate internal challenges while presenting a compelling vision to the electorate.(With AFP inputs)","The British parliament was dissolved on Thursday, as the five-week campaign period begun leading up to the general election on July 4.
