NEW DELHI: Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of ‘Birch by Romeo Lane’ nightclub in Goa, were detained by Thai Police early on Thursday on the request of Indian law enforcement agencies, sources said. The duo was wanted after fleeing the country following last week’s blaze that claimed 25 lives. They were detained from a resort in Phuket.They had fled to Phuket, Thailand. The Thailand Police on Thursday released pictures showing the brothers in their custody. They will be deported and handed over to the Indian authorities. A team has already reached there, sources said.Goa Police had requested the Interpol through MEA and CBI for their apprehension. A blue corner notice was subsequently issued against them by the Interpol.A blue notice is typically issued to gather additional information about a person’s identity, whereabouts or activities in connection with a criminal investigation.Goa Police said it would help trace the accused and also prevent them from migrating to any other country from their present destination. A senior Goa police officer said while a blue corner notice typically takes about a week to process, in this case, it was issued within two days of the incident with the support of central agencies.India and Thailand signed a formal extradition treaty in 2013, which came into force on June 29, 2015. Goa CM Pramod Sawant told TOI a team will be sent to Thailand to bring back the accused.The regional passport office, New Delhi, has, meanwhile, issued a notice to the brothers seeking an explanation from both as to why action should not be initiated to impound their passports within seven days.On Sunday, a Goa Police team had reached Delhi with an arrest warrant for the Luthra brothers and searched their residential and office premises, but they were not found. “Since they were unavailable, a notice under the appropriate sections of law was pasted at their residence. By the evening of Dec 7, a lookout circular was issued against both by the Bureau of Immigration at the request of Goa Police,” a Goa Police officer said.The Bureau of Immigration in Mumbai later informed investigators that the brothers boarded IndiGo flight 6E 1073 to Phuket at 5.30am Sunday, just hours after the blaze.A lookout notice was also issued against the owner of the property, UK national Surinder Kumar Khosla, and the Luthras’ partner, Ajay Gupta.The blaze broke out around 11.45pm Saturday during an event attended by more than 150 tourists. A preliminary investigation by Goa Police and Directorate of Fire Services found it was triggered when electric firecrackers struck the wooden ceiling. As flames coursed through the roof, the guests and performers bolted. While most of them were able to step out of the club, many were trapped in the basement after the exit caught fire.","Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of ‘Birch by Romeo Lane’ nightclub in Goa, were detained by Thai Police early on Thursday on the request of Indian law enforcement agencies.

GOA: In the aftermath of the devastating December 6 fire at the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, North Goa, which claimed 25 lives, the North Goa district administration on Thursday banned fireworks inside nightclubs, hotels, and other tourist establishments.BJP’s coalition partner in the government, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), on Wednesday called for the closure of all nightclubs in the state to promote “good tourism.” Since 2014, the MGP has opposed pubs, public bikini swimming, massage parlours, and illegal casinos. The party is Goa’s oldest regional political outfit.“Nightclubs do not sync with Goa’s culture. It is the worst culture. Nightclubs should be stopped,” MGP president Deepak ‘Pandurang’ Dhavalikar said.Dhavalikar said that it is his personal opinion and the same would be discussed at the MGP meeting.The culture of pubs, swimming in bikinis on beaches, massage parlours, and illegal casinos is against ‘Bharatiya saunskruti’ (Indian culture) and should be banned, then PWD minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin Dhavalikar had said in 2014.On Wednesday, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant had convened a high-level meeting with senior officials and key tourism stakeholders to reinforce safety measures ahead of the upcoming Christmas and New Year season.During the meeting, the government issued strict directives to prevent any repeat of the tragedy.Licences of tourist establishments in Goa that lacked fire safety compliance were set to be cancelled. The government also prohibited the sale of liquor after 11 pm across the state to curb late-night violations. Tourists were advised to avoid swimming in danger zones, particularly along beaches identified as high-risk by lifeguard agencies. While the tourism season was to continue as planned, it was to operate under heightened monitoring and stricter compliance checks.Six people had been arrested in connection with the Arpora nightclub fire as authorities intensified their crackdown on illegal operations and safety lapses.Officials said the government would conduct surprise inspections of nightclubs, shacks, and high-footfall venues while reviewing all licences and safety certifications to ensure full compliance.The meeting was held against the backdrop of the December 6 fire at the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, North Goa, which claimed 25 lives, according to sources.“The chief minister briefed those present at the meeting about various measures taken to ensure such a tragedy did not recur in the state,” a senior officer privy to the meeting said.He added that the state government had issued multiple orders and formed committees, including a high-level magisterial inquiry panel and a fire safety audit committee, after the incident.“The chief minister ordered all departments to ensure there was no laxity, especially considering Goa would be seeing a large number of tourists during the Christmas and New Year festivities,” the officer said.(With agency inputs)","BJP’s coalition partner in the government, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), on Wednesday called for the closure of all nightclubs in the state.

'Warm And Engaging': PM Modi Holds Phone Call With Trump Amid Trade Talks, US-India Ties Discussed

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and United States President Donald Trump held a telephone conversation on Thursday and reviewed the progress of the India–US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership.Both leaders expressed satisfaction with the steady strengthening of bilateral cooperation across a broad range of areas.According to an official statement, the two leaders discussed ways to sustain momentum in efforts to enhance bilateral trade.They also exchanged views on expanding cooperation in critical technologies, energy, defence and security, and other priority sectors linked to the implementation of the India–US COMPACT (Catalyzing Opportunities for Military Partnership, Accelerated Commerce and Technology) for the 21st century. PM Modi and Trump also spoke about key regional and global developments. They agreed to work closely to address shared challenges and advance common interests in the evolving geopolitical landscape.Also Read: Goyal reacts to Trump admin’s ‘best ever’ offers view; says America should sign agreement The two leaders agreed to remain in touch as both sides continue to deepen the strategic partnership.The conversation between both leaders takes place days after Russian President Vladimir Putin landed in New Delhi for a high-stakes two-day summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.It was Putin's first state visit to India since the Ukraine war began in February 2022.During the Russian president's visit, a carpooling picture of PM Modi and Putin even found a place at the US Congress discussion on India-US ties.""This poster is worth a thousand words,"" said US representative Sydney Kamlager-Dove, pointing towards the image, as she went on to slam the Donald Trump administration's foreign policy towards India.""Trump's policies towards India can only be described as cutting our nose to spite our face... Being a coercive partner has a cost. And this poster is worth a thousand words,"" she said.""You do not get a Nobel Peace Prize by driving US strategic partners into the arms of our adversaries,"" Dove said in a pointed attack at Trump's demands for the peace prize for what he has repeatedly claimed for having stopped eight wars, including India and Pakistan.""We must move with incredible urgency to mitigate the damage that this administration has done to the US-India partnership and return to the cooperation that is essential to US prosperity, security, and global leadership,"" she added.These comments were delivered during the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on South and Central Asia’s hearing on 'The US-India Strategic Partnership: Securing a Free and Open Indo-Pacific'.Trump has already slapped 50% tariffs on most Indian exports in August 2025 amid wider trade tensions and worries over India’s imports of Russian oil.A US trade delegation was in India on December 10–11 for discussions that have so far made little headway. The talks have been bogged down by disputes over market access and tariff policies, further straining the trade relationship.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. President Donald Trump held a telephone conversation on Thursday.

Trump’s Massive Visa Crackdown: 85,000 Cancellations and Social-Media Scrutiny Hit Indians

NEW DELHI: The United States on Thursday clarified that its consular officers will reject tourist visa applications if they determine that the primary purpose of travel is to give birth in the country in order to secure US citizenship for the child.Officials said such travel is not permitted and will result in a visa denial.A State Department advisory notes that adjudicating officers are required to assess the applicant’s intent, and if they believe the visit is planned for childbirth to obtain citizenship, the visa cannot be granted.The rule is part of the US government’s broader policy to curb what it considers misuse of visitor visas for birth tourism.Earlier this year, US department of state said, ""“It is unacceptable for foreign parents to use a US tourist visa for the primary purpose of giving birth in the United States to obtain citizenship for the child, which also could result in American taxpayers paying the medical care costs.”“This is known as birth tourism and US consular officers deny all such visa applications under US immigration law. Those who abuse our immigration system through birth tourism may be ineligible for future visas or travel to the United States.

Amit Shah gives point-by-point rebuttal on 'vote chori' charge

NEW DELHI: The debate on the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in the Lok Sabha turned heated on Wednesday as leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi challenged home minister Amit Shah to an open debate, prompting a firm response from the minister: ""I will decide.""As Shah countered the opposition’s allegations of 'vote chori' and referred to Rahul Gandhi’s charge of ""multiple voters at one Haryana house,"" the Congress leader stood up, interrupting the speech.""My question yesterday was that for the first time in history, full immunity was given to the election commissioner. I wanted to know the reasoning behind this decision. Secondly, about Haryana, he [Amit Shah] took one example of fake voters, but there are 19 lakh fake voters,” Rahul said.""You tell us ... actually, let us have a debate on my press conference, very good idea, let us go, let us have a debate,"" he added.""Amit Shah ji, I challenge you, I challenge you to have a debate,"" Rahul declared in the House.Amid uproar, Shah responded, ""Speaker sir, I want to clarify first, I have been elected as an MLA or MP for the last 30 years. I have a long experience of the procedures.""Looking directly at Rahul Gandhi, he said in a stern manner, ""Parliament will not proceed according to your wishes.I will decide the sequence of my speech. The Parliament will not work like this.""""Speaker sir, he should have some patience to listen to my answer. I will reply to each and everything. But he will not decide the sequence of my speech, I will decide it,"" Shah reiterated.""This is a completely defensive response, a scared response,"" Rahul retorted.Resuming his address with a noticeably calm tone, Shah told Speaker Om Birla, ""I can see worry lines on your face. Do not worry, I will not be provoked by them. I will continue with my reply.""Shah then went on to address the 'vote chori' accusations, stating that such issues occurred during the tenures of Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. He also referenced a case in the Delhi high court, alleging that Sonia Gandhi became a voter before becoming Indian.Amit Shah offered a point-by-point rebuttal over the allegation of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over vote theft in the Lok Sabha.During the ongoing debate on electoral reforms in the Parliament, Shah took a jibe at the Congress leader's ""nuclear bomb"" press conference said that his press conferences are not ""Constitutional provisions.""""Opposition Leader Rahul Gandhi dropped a “nuclear bomb” in a press conference on 5 November 2025. In that ‘nuclear bomb’, he claimed that 501 votes had been cast from a single house in Haryana. The Election Commission has clarified that House Number 265 is no small dwelling, but rather a joint residence for multiple families built on a one-acre ancestral plot,"" the home minister said.""However, separate house numbers have not been assigned to each family, so their house number is simply listed as 265. And in one of those families, three generations are living together. This numbering has been in place since the Congress government was elected in Haryana. It is neither a fake house nor fake votes,"" he added.Shah also said that it is unfair to blame the people who appear twice in the voter list.""Congress has claimed that some individuals are registered in two different locations on the electoral roll. It is unfair to blame the people who appear twice, as this is often a result of systemic issues. Since 2010, the Returning Officer's authority to remove duplicate entries has been revoked, which has led to such discrepancies. In fact, there are several leaders whose names are registered in more than one place. These are common mistakes caused by the updated rules,"" Shah said.",Amit Shah offered a point-by-point rebuttal over the allegation of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over vote theft in the Lok Sabha.

Why will we run away from own country: Sunali

NEW DELHI: More than nine months pregnant now, and visibly exhausted, Sunali Khatun's voice carried a strange mix of tired resolve and simmering anger when she spoke to TOI on Thursday. ""I'm tired from inside. The worst part is that despite showing all documents, no one listened to us,"" she said, fighting back tears.The 26-year-old domestic worker from Paikar village in West Bengal's Birbhum district was detained during an identity verification drive in Delhi's Rohini in late June this year. Sunali said she and her husband, Danish Sekh, immediately produced every document they had - Aadhaar, PAN and ration card. ""I even quickly presented my in-laws' ID proofs arranged over WhatsApp the same night."" Nothing worked.We did everything in our power,"" Sunali said. ""We showed every single document. We kept telling them, 'We are not Bangladeshi. We are Indian.' Who will listen to people like us?""Within 48 hours, on June 26, after the Foreigners Regional Registration Office deportation order, police seized the couple's belongings from their Rohini jhuggi and took them and their eight-year-old son, Sabir Sekh, to Guwahati.From there, she said, they were pushed across the Bangladesh border in hot haste.The deportation was sudden and unexpected for the couple and their families back in West Bengal. For the next five months, Sunali was trapped in a maze of suspicion. What followed, she says, ""broke something inside her.""After filing a missing-person complaint at his local Palkar police station on 6 July 2025, Sunali's father, Bhodu Sekh, moved the Calcutta HC three days later.

22 Feared Dead As Truck Falls Into Gorge In Arunachal Pradesh

GUWAHATI: A possibly lone survivor among 22 people on board a truck that plunged into a gorge in a remote location of Arunachal Pradesh Monday night clambered out of the wreckage, climbed 200m and trudged nearly 4km to reach a BRO camp late Wednesday to report the tragedy almost 48 hours later.The victims - 19 bodies had been retrieved until Thursday evening - were all labourers from Assam being ferried to a site in Anjaw district, bordering China, when the accident occurred along Hayuliang-Chaglagam Road. Army teams continue to search for the other two workers.It wasn't immediately clear if the critically injured survivor included the truck driver among the 22 that he said were involved in the crash, officials said. He has been shifted to Assam Medical College and Hospital in Dibrugarh, around 260km from Hayuliang.Nang Chingni Choupoo, in charge of the Anjaw district disaster management department, told TOI that Army teams used ropes to descend into the deep gorge and trace the wreckage. The 19 bodies found so far are still to be brought up.""Since the Army personnel do not have specialised equipment to carry the bodies, an NDRF team from Dibrugarh is being sent there with the required equipment.The operation will resume Friday morning,"" Choupoo said. ""For now, we are assuming there were 22 people, unless the driver wasn't counted. The mangled truck lies upside down and rescuers need to cut through the metal to determine if anyone is trapped inside.""The Assam govt has deputed a joint team of the Tinsukia civil and police administration to travel to the area and coordinate with Army and Arunachal Pradesh officials. The nearest camp, which the injured survivor reached, belongs to the General Reserve Engineer Force under which BRO operates.Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said both states were working closely to rescue survivors, if any, and get the victims' bodies home.Defence PRO Lt Col M Rawat said multiple search and rescue columns of the Army, medical teams, GREF representatives, local police and NDRF personnel worked for hours to locate the wreckage and the bodies.Initial reports suggested the workers were from Tinsukia and travelling to Chaglagam for work.

PATNA: About a month after she broke off relations with her family, RJD chief Lalu Prasad's daughter, Rohini Acharya, signalled there was further strain when she appealed to Bihar's govt to ensure that every woman can stay safely in her parental home. Rohini, who lives in Singapore, had donated her kidney to her father Lalu in Dec 2022 for transplant at a Singapore hospital.In a social media post on Thursday, she indirectly praised chief minister Nitish Kumar for distributing Rs 10,000 among women and giving cycles to schoolgirls, but said these steps were inadequate. Rohini said that in Bihar, a deeply rooted patriarchal mindset creates the need for widespread change in both social and political spheres.""Every daughter has the right to grow up with the assurance that her parental home is a safe place, where she can return without fear, guilt, shame, or having to explain herself to anyone,"" she wrote on X, asserting implementing this measure is not just an ""administrative duty"" but a step towards saving countless women from future exploitation and harassment.Her observation comes about a month after she quit RJD and disowned her family members following a verbal spat, allegedly with her brother Tejashwi Yadav over RJD's assembly election disaster. She also alleged she was accused of donating a ""dirty kidney"" to her father after ""extracting crores of rupees and a Lok Sabha ticket"".","Lalu Prasad's daughter, Rohini Acharya, has voiced concerns about women's safety in Bihar.

The two hold 51% and 49% equity, respectively. The unit includes a 133-meter dam and an underground powerhouse with five turbines.While work continues, Ravi Kumar Sharma, president of one of the two official unions at the project, said the fresh tensions began after two groups attempted to form two other unions despite not being employees. Several outsiders tried to mobilise workers two days ago and threatened the management.Sharma alleged that a senior official of Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Ltd, the current project developer, was assaulted five days ago and his vehicle stoned.“This prompted the company’s CEO to tell us that the project will be stopped,” Sharma said.Project CEO Harpal Singh said the main issue was political pressure to hire only from Kishtwar and specific areas. He alleged that since the project was awarded to Megha in April 2022, local politicians allegedly have interfered, forcing the company to take in inexperienced workers. “How long will this continue?” Singh asked.Since Megha bagged the contract, the project has been halted several times due to job protests and complaints about debris affecting nearby villages. Asked about the problems, Kishtwar BJP MLA Shagun Parihar declined comment, insisting the issue was between the company and locals.“We understand that similar disruptions in 2013 had stalled the project for eight years and caused losses to local workers, leaving them jobless. We resumed work later. This is a national project. We will not allow it to be shut down,” union chief Sharma said.After its foundation in 2013, the project’s contract was awarded to GVK Group on a 35-year build-own-operate-transfer basis.

Why the Sherrone Moore firing created the perfect storm for the Paige Shiver pregnancy rumor

What is confirmed about Paige Shiver and why her name is repeating in every Sherrone Moore conversation

Is Paige Shiver pregnant is the question sitting at the top of every search bar now that the Sherrone Moore story has turned into a full public meltdown. Michigan fired Sherrone Moore for cause, police detained him hours later, and the university confirmed only one concrete detail. There was an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. The school did not name the staffer. Law enforcement did not name the staffer. Yet Paige Shiver has been pushed into the center of the scandal by social media detectives who filled in the gaps with their own theories.The rumor grew even louder once Shiver deleted or hid her social media accounts. That timing alone was enough for people to assume something explosive had happened. None of the pregnancy claims have been confirmed by the university, law enforcement, or any official source. They remain unverified speculation attached to a real firing and a real police detention.Michigan cut Sherrone Moore with immediate effect after internal investigators said they found credible evidence of an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. Athletic director Warde Manuel’s statement was clear and direct.“U M head football coach Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately. Following a university investigation, credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. This conduct constitutes a clear violation of university policy, and U M maintains zero tolerance for such behavior,” he said.That was the official foundation. Everything after that came from outside the university.A few hours after his termination, officers in Saline, Michigan detained Sherrone Moore during a domestic incident at an apartment. The Pittsfield Township Police Department took over the investigation. ESPN’s Dan Wetzel reported the development on X, stating that authorities located and detained Moore for potential charges. Police have said the incident was not random. Reports from Michigan have also noted that Moore threatened to harm himself during the encounter. The investigation is ongoing and the exact charges remain unknown.The timing, the firing for cause, the police involvement, and the sudden vacuum around the unnamed staffer created an open space online. Users decided to choose their own protagonist. That is how the theory about Paige Shiver began.Shiver joined Michigan in 2022 in on campus recruiting and operations. She became the executive assistant to the head coach in 2024. That role places her physically and professionally close to the head coach at all times. Combine that proximity with the fact that the university did not release a name and you have a recipe for internet assignment.The rumor escalated when users noticed that she set her Instagram to private and deactivated her LinkedIn and X accounts. Marca reported that her Facebook page now shows only her profile and cover image. People interpreted the move as confirmation. In reality, any employee who becomes the target of unverified allegations often shuts down digital profiles to avoid harassment.The pregnancy claim grew out of posts from large commentary accounts on X that have no official sourcing. These accounts circulated messages, screenshots, and unverified claims that spread quickly. None of the claims about pregnancy appear in any official document, press release, police report, or university statement. They remain social media theories with no confirmation.Meanwhile, everything officially tied to the firing stays the same. The university confirmed an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. The staff member has not been identified. The rumor that the staff member is Paige Shiver and that she is pregnant is not supported by any confirmed evidence.Away from the sidelines and the pressure of Michigan football, Moore is simply a father of three. He and his wife, Kelli, share daughters Shiloh, Solei, and Sadie, who have long been described by people around the family as the center of his world. Moore rarely speaks publicly about them, but he has often hinted that they are the foundation of his life outside coaching.Social media has turned the Moore scandal into a frenzy, and one of the loudest claims is that Paige Shiver and Kelli Moore may have known each other beyond the workplace. Nothing has been confirmed, but the idea of his alleged mistress being friendly with his wife is adding a sharper edge to already wild pregnancy rumors and online speculation.The confirmed information about her is simple and factual. According to Larry Brown Sports and the Michigan athletics website, Shiver joined the Wolverines in 2022 and moved into the executive assistant position in 2024. She has worked in operations, recruitment support, and administrative planning. She is the daughter of longtime Chicago Bears scout Jeff Shiver. She is also a Purdue graduate who was profiled by the Bears in 2016 for her experience living with Pompe Disease.None of these details link her directly to the inappropriate relationship that resulted in Moore’s firing. None link her to the police detention. None confirm any pregnancy rumor.What is not confirmed is whether the staff member involved is Paige Shiver. What is not confirmed is whether she was pregnant. None of this appears in official records. None of it has been acknowledged by the university or the police.Per AP, Sherrone Moore is set to be arraigned Thursday afternoon, barely a day after he was fired for what the university called an inappropriate relationship with a staff member and later arrested just south of Michigan Stadium. Court records show he is still in the custody of the Washtenaw County Jail, which has not released details about the reason for his detention or his bond status.","Paige Shiver has been pulled into the Sherrone Moore scandal amid unverified pregnancy rumors.

Army rescue teams located the 19 bodies on Thursday but lacked the equipment to retrieve them; bodies remain covered at the site.

An NDRF team from Dibrugarh, equipped with ropes and recovery gear, will resume operations on Friday morning.

Authorities believe 22 workers were on board, based on the survivor’s statement; two remain missing. The count may rise to 23 if the driver is considered separately.

The truck wreckage is upside down, mangled, and hidden by dense foliage, making aerial or roadside spotting impossible.

Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said both Assam and Arunachal Pradesh are coordinating the search and providing assistance.

Local authorities are questioning the sub-contractor linked to the Zila Parishad Member, Chaglagam, to verify worker details and employment records.

GUWAHATI: A mini truck carrying labourers from Assam plunged into a deep gorge in Arunachal Pradesh’s Anjaw district, killing at least 19 of the 22 people believed to be on board. The accident occurred on Monday night along the remote Hayuliang–Chaglagam road near the China border.The truck had reportedly skidded off the hilly road and plunged into a deep gorge while the group was travelling to Hayuliang for construction work. The accident, which occurred along the Hayuliang–Chaglagam road bordering China on Monday night, came to light only on Wednesday after a severely injured survivor climbed nearly 200 metres out of the gorge and trekked about 4km to a nearby GREF camp of the BRO to alert officials.The survivor was shifted to Assam Medical College and Hospital in Dibrugarh for treatment.Anjaw district disaster management officer in-charge Nang Chingni Choupoo told TOI that officials had assumed 22 people were travelling in the truck based on the survivor’s account. Of the remaining 21, 19 deaths had been confirmed, while two were missing. She added that it was still unclear whether the number included the driver or only the workers.","A mini truck carrying labourers from Assam plunged into a deep gorge in Arunachal Pradesh’s Anjaw district, killing at least 19 of the 22 people believed to be on board.

Paige Shiver’s personal life: What we know so far





Whispers around the Michigan football program have grown louder in recent days, pulling one name into the center of a storm she never addressed publicly. Paige Shiver, a staff member in the University of Michigan athletic department, has become the subject of widespread speculation after social media users connected her to the “inappropriate relationship” that led to the dismissal of head coach Sherrone Moore. As the rumors circulated, her online activity drew even more attention, especially when her accounts went quiet during the height of the discussion. The university has not identified the staff member involved, but curiosity online has only increased.This sudden spotlight has pushed Shiver, who rarely appeared in public conversations about the team, into a narrative she has never confirmed. According to Larry Brown Sports, Shiver is listed as the “Executive Assistant” to the head coach, a role that naturally placed her near program operations. When Moore was fired on December 10, 2025, after officials cited an “inappropriate relationship,” speculation quickly turned toward anyone who worked closely with him. Although none of the allegations have been verified, the internet filled the silence with theories, further magnifying Shiver’s name.According to Larry Brown Sports, Paige Shiver was promoted to Sherrone Moore’s executive assistant in 2024 after serving as an on-campus recruiting staffer.She joined Michigan in November 2021 and, over time, became a familiar presence within football operations. Her family has deep roots in the sport. Her father, Jeff Shiver, is a long-time scout for the Chicago Bears, and her uncle, Emerson Kampen III, is known for his work in basketball analysis.Paige Shiver’s education traces back to Purdue University, where she built a foundation in nonprofit and athletic administration. Before moving into college sports, she worked in development, marketing, and fundraising for the Muscular Dystrophy Association. A feature published by the Chicago Bears in 2016 also revealed that she has Pompe Disease, a rare progressive disorder requiring weekly treatments that changed her athletic lifestyle.The attention surrounding her name grew once reports noted that her Instagram account became private and her X and LinkedIn profiles were deactivated on December 10, 2025. Neither she nor Moore has commented on the claims that tied them to an alleged affair or the rumor involving a pregnancy and abortion. With no confirmation from any official source, the claims remain unverified. Her personal life, including her dating history, also remains unknown, leaving much of the conversation built on speculation rather than facts.Also Read: Why Sherrone Moore ended up in police custody amid Michigan firing him for alleged ‘inappropriate relationship’ scandal",Paige Shiver is a staff member in the University of Michigan athletic department.

'Execute Tomorrow...': Candace Owens Claims Charlie Kirk Sent Alarming Texts Before Assassination

What Erika Kirk and Bari Weiss said to Candace Owens







Candace Owens is very upset after a new clip showed Erika Kirk speaking about her in an interview with Bari Weiss of CBS News. The clip talked about the conspiracy stories that spread after Charlie Kirk was fatally shot on September 10 at an event at Utah Valley University. After his death, Candace Owens shared many theories online. She spoke about the Israeli government, TPUSA leaders, and even the US military. But she did not show any proof for these claims. Because of this, many people questioned her posts. So when Erika Kirk spoke about these ideas in her interview, Owens did not like the comments.Candace Owens later said she was “in a bad mood” after watching the clip. She added, “Bari Weiss refers to me as a liar and Erika Kirk does not rebut.” Owens felt Erika Kirk stayed quiet when Weiss talked about the conspiracy theories.During the interview, Bari Weiss strongly questioned the false stories around Charlie Kirk’s killing. Weiss said, “She’s making a huge amount of money on it. She’s building her business off of these lies.” She said Candace Owens was using the theories to grow her platform.Erika Kirk then spoke directly to Owens with very simple words.She said, “Stop. That’s it. That’s all I have to say. Stop.”Her reply was short but very firm. She made it clear she did not want the theories to continue.This is not the first time Erika Kirk has spoken about these claims. In another talk, she said conspiracy stories were like a “mind virus.” Candace Owens believed this comment was aimed at her, and the tension between them grew even more. Since then, Owens has been answering Erika Kirk on her own show and reacting to almost every new comment.While their feud keeps growing, the case of Charlie Kirk’s death is still moving forward in court. Tyler Robinson, the man charged with the shooting, appeared in person in court today. Police say he is the one responsible for killing Kirk. The case remains open, and more updates are expected as the investigation continues.Also Read: “Meghan Markle Syndrome”: Candace Owens Challenges Erika Kirk’s Request To Hide Charlie Kirk’s Grave And Raises Fresh Questions","Candace Owens is very upset after a new clip showed Erika Kirk speaking about her in an interview with Bari Weiss of CBS News.

Chhattisgarh Occult Ritual Death: Lured by ‘money doubling’ 3 men die in Chhattisgarh during occult ritual; kin cite one had lemon in mouth; 5 detained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/whiff-of-occult-as-money-doubling-ritual-claims-3-lives-in-cg/articleshow/125917563.cms,"RAIPUR: Three men, including a well-known businessman, died under mysterious circumstances at a farmhouse in Chhattisgarh's Korba district on Wednesday late night, in what appeared to be a deadly cocktail of alleged tantric (occult) practices, black magic, money-doubling fraud and suspected strangulation.The incident took place at Kudri village, where scrap trader Mohammed Ashraf Memon and two others – Suresh Sahu of Korba, and Nitish Kumar of Baloda Bazar – were found dead during a purported occult ritual.Preliminary inputs suggest that the men were lured with a promise that Rs 5 lakh would multiply to Rs 2.5 crore overnight through a ‘tantra-mantra' ritual. A ‘baiga' or occult practitioner and his team of four had reportedly come from Bilaspur to conduct a ritual at businessman Ashraf's farmhouse in Korba, where a special room was said to be reserved for such activities.Family members and local sources claimed that during the ritual, the condition of all three men deteriorated and they later died. One of the bodies was reportedly found with a lemon in the mouth, while all bodies had strangulation marks on the neck.Speaking to TOI, Korba SP Siddharth Tiwari said police have detained five persons in connection with the incident, including the ‘baiga', among the four persons who allegedly were practicing occult, based on initial evidence.While the forensic team was recreating the scene, police sought a short post-mortem report of the deceased for more clarity, the SP said.""We were informed around 12 am on Thursday that three persons were brought dead to the hospital. A rush of probes followed and the site was also inspected. The scene had evidence of tantric rituals and the suspicious objects were sent for forensic examination. The man who rushed the three men to a hospital, was caught by the latter's relatives and others and was beaten up,"" the SP said.Relatives who saw the bodies alleged foul play, saying there were multiple injury marks and scratches suggesting assault or coercion.A police officer said the farmhouse had long been rumoured to have been rife with occult activities. Investigators were examining the call detail records of the deceased, digital footprints, materials seized from the farmhouse and the sequence of events leading up to the deaths. Police said they were probing all angles – occult practices, financial fraud, personal dispute and a possible pre-planned assault, adding that the investigation will be thorough and detailed, covering all possibilities being speculated upon.Post-mortem reports, along with forensic and electronic evidence, are expected to be crucial in determining whether the case is one of lethal superstition-driven fraud, ritual gone wrong or a carefully staged triple murder.Meanwhile, the sensational case triggered shock and anxiety in Korba and nearby areas, with residents clueless on how a promise of multiplying money ‘fifty times' could end in three violent and unexplained deaths.","Three men, including a well-known businessman, died under mysterious circumstances at a farmhouse in Chhattisgarh's Korba district on Wednesday late night.

:

HAZARIBAGThe National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday carried out an early morning raid in Hazaribag in connection with the recent bomb blast near Red Fort in Delhi.A six-member NIA team, accompanied by CRPF and police personnel, reached Ansar Nagar under the jurisdiction of Pelawal police station around 5 am and searched the residence of a suspected ISIS operative, Shahnawaz Alam. Currently, Alam is in jail in Pune.The NIA and ATS teams arrived in three vehicles and immediately cordoned off the area. Over 25 CRPF personnel, including male and female commandos, secured the premises as the officers questioned family members and examined various parts of the house. An additional police force was also deployed in the neighbourhood as a precaution.Sources said the raid was based on fresh intelligence inputs regarding Alam’s suspected networks. The search lasted over 10 hours and involved scanning documents, electronic devices and material linked to extremist activities. NIA officials kept their distance from the media and local police during and after the raid. The team brought a printer into the house, prompting speculations that copies of important documents were made on the spot.Alam, originally from Hazaribag, studied at AIIMS and previously worked at diagnostic centres in Ranchi and Hazaribag.He was first arrested by Delhi Police’s special cell in 2023 for suspected ISIS connections and by the NIA in October 2023 from Pune for alleged links to an ISIS module. This was the second NIA raid at his house since that arrest.Investigations have revealed Alam’s involvement in cases of robbery and theft in Hazaribag in 2019. He spent eight to nine months in jail before securing bail in December 2020, during which he allegedly came into contact with ISIS handlers. His arrest was linked to a Pune ISIS module, where he was believed to have played a key role. Officials suspected that parts of his network remain active in Jharkhand, and he is thought to have been trained in forested areas near Pune and to have been in touch with notorious ISIS operatives.The NIA is now focusing on identifying Alam’s local connections, possible associates and materials used in terror-related activities. Officials said more revelations were expected as the investigation progressed. Sources added that many electronic gadgets were seized, though this has not been officially confirmed. Neither NIA officials nor police have shared details of the raid.Shahnawaz’s passport was issued in Ranchi on October 31, 2016 and is valid until October 30, 2026. His date of birth is recorded as March 5, 1993.","National Investigation Agency (NIA) carried out an early morning raid in Hazaribag in connection with the recent bomb blast near Red Fort in Delhi.

‘No one gives jobs’: How murder-accused tag has made them unemployable despite bail in Akhlaq case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/dadri-lynching-how-murder-accused-tag-has-made-them-unemployable-despite-bail/articleshow/125920172.cms,"NOIDA: For the men once named as accused in the Akhlaq murder case, life has never returned to normal. The ""murder accused"" label has followed them long after their release on bail, shutting most doors to employment and leaving families in a limbo.The 2015 murder case, which began with an FIR naming 10 persons and later expanded to 18 accused, has left its mark on every individual involved. Two of the accused, Ravi and Rohit, have died — one in judicial custody and the other in a workplace accident. Three were declared juveniles. The rest, now out on bail, have found themselves virtually unemployable, with both govt offices and private companies unwilling to hire them.Rupendra (32) was a law student when he was named as the main accused. Unable to find work, he now sells chole-kulche from a thela in the village, a far cry from his earlier ambitions.Vivek (30) continues to work as an electrician, while his younger brother Sachin, who was a minor at the time, works as a labourer. Brothers Hariom and Shriom also earn daily wages, having failed to secure stable jobs.Sandeep, who was unemployed before the incident, now runs a small auto-parts shop.Saurabh is jobless, but his brother Gaurav has managed to find work with a private company in Greater Noida. Vinay, once a home guard, lost his job after his arrest and remains unemployed. Hariom, previously jobless, now drives a van, ferrying schoolchildren. Puneet, another minor at the time, works as a security guard.Arun, now 40, still works as a vet in Bisada, but the case, he said, had destroyed his professional network. ""I was arrested after the incident and spent 18 months in jail. I had a toddler and my wife was pregnant at the time. She delivered our baby while I was still in jail. I spent nearly Rs 7-8 lakh on the legal battle. After bail, I lost my network and my livelihood suffered. Alongside my vet work, I now buy and sell fly ash to make ends meet,"" he said.Vishal Rana (29) was pursuing a pharmacy degree when he was arrested. He spent nearly 22 months in jail, abandoned his studies, and struggled to find work after his release. ""The case was in the limelight for years, and it tarnished the name of Bisada and the people involved. No private company offers jobs to those whose names are in police records. After a lot of struggle, Vishal has started a restaurant in Surajpur area,"" his father, Sanjay Rana, recalled. In 2017, there was a brief glimmer of hope when the accused were offered contractual jobs at NTPC Dadri. But once the matter drew public attention, NTPC withdrew the offers, leaving the men to fend for themselves once again.With the state govt now considering withdrawal of the case, their families hope for relief and a chance to move on. ""If the govt wants to withdraw it, it will be good for communal harmony,"" said Sanjay Rana.On Sept 28, 2015, 52-year-old Akhlaq was dragged out of his house in Bisada village and beaten to death by a mob after a temple announced he had slaughtered a cow and stored beef in his refrigerator. His son Danish suffered grievous injuries as he attempted to save his father.","Two of the accused, Ravi and Rohit, have died — one in judicial custody and the other in a workplace accident.

A test that stops a nation



Why this year’s english section sparked outrage







South Korea’s top official responsible for administering the country’s high-stakes university entrance exam has resigned following intense criticism over the difficulty of this year’s English section. Oh Seung-geol, head of the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation, stepped down after admitting the test failed to meet the standards of its absolute-grading system. Only 3.11 per cent of candidates earned the top grade this year — the lowest since absolute grading was introduced in 2018.Oh said several questions had been rewritten late in the process after similarities were found with private mock tests. “In so doing, we were not able to properly assess the difficulty level of some questions,” he said. His resignation is unusual: of the 12 previous exam chiefs, most stepped down over test-setting errors, but Oh is the first to quit because the questions were deemed too hard.The Suneung, held every November, is an eight-hour marathon that can shape students’ university prospects, careers and even future relationships.This year saw more than 550,000 applicants — the highest in seven years — many of them born in 2007, a year with an unusually high birth rate. On exam day, the country slows down: construction pauses, flights are grounded during the English listening section, and police help rush late students to their test centres.At schools nationwide, parents lit candles in temples, classmates formed cheering squads, and public transport schedules were adjusted to give students a smooth journey. Competition for top universities is expected to be fiercer than usual, especially after the government reversed a planned expansion of medical school seats.The English exam has long been considered tough, but this year’s questions — including a dense philosophy passage and another involving gaming jargon, triggered widespread anger, as per the BBC. One question asked students to determine the correct placement of a sentence about avatars and virtual perception, a task many called unnecessarily convoluted. Online, students described the wording as “fancy smart talking” and “awful writing”.Only 15,154 students received the top grade, roughly half the proportion of last year. Some educators argued the passages were too specialised, while others criticised the reliance on excerpts removed from context. Students said the options felt confusing and time-consuming, leaving many guessing until the final minute.Yet some academics defended the difficulty, saying the test measures whether students can handle university-level reading. English literature professor Kim Soo-yeon said the chosen texts had “some degree of specialisation” appropriate for assessing comprehension.","Oh Seung-geol, head of the Korea Institute for Curriculum and Evaluation, stepped down after admitting the test failed to meet the standards of its absolute-grading system.

NEW DELHI: Delhi's Rohini district court rejected transit anticipatory bail pleas from Gaurav and Saurav Luthra, owners of Goa's Birch by Romeo Lane restaurant, expressed fears of being “lynched in Goa” in their bail application, while the police in the beach state charged them with murder among other offences for the fire that took 25 lives at their nightclub last Saturday.The brothers, who fled to Thailand after the incident, were detained in Phuket on December 11, with deportation proceedings initiated.Additional sessions Judge Vandana denied the bail applications after hearing submissions from the Goa Police and the accused persons' senior advocate.Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Vandana rejected the pleas of Gaurav and Saurav Luthra after hearing the submissions of counsel for the Goa Police and senior advocate for the accused persons.""The nature of offence, prima facie, is grave and serious in nature where 25 people have lost their lives,"" ASJ Vandana said in the order.The court further said that, in view of the grave and serious nature of the applicants' conduct and the allegations levelled against them, this court is not inclined to exercise discretion in their favour.""In view of the aforesaid reasons, and without expressing any opinion on the merits or veracity of the allegations, this court finds no ground to entertain the present application seeking Transit Anticipatory Bail and to suspend the LOC,"" ASJ Vandana ordered on December 11.While deciding the pleas, the court rejected the contention of senior counsel Tanvir Ahmed Mir that there is a threat to the life of the accused persons.""The applicant has stated that there is an immediate threat to his life. However, the applicant has failed to show the basis of any such apprehension,"" the court said.It also said that the action taken by the investigating authority or by the court, as per law, can't be said to be an apprehension of a threat to life.The court said that the applicants are admittedly at Phuket (Thailand), but it remained unexplained as to why they have not approached the competent court that has jurisdiction in Goa.The court also noted the Goa Police's submissions that the accused persons left the country within hours of the incident.""The documents qua the flight taken by the applicant show that the ticket was booked on 07.12.2025 at 1.17 am. and the flight departed at 5.20 am on 07.12.2025, though the applicant has concealed the fact, stating that he left for Phuket (Thailand) on 06.12.2025, prior to the incident,"" the court observed in the order.The court also refused to grant the interim relief because the accused is suffering from seizure disorder and hypertension.The court noted the submissions of senior counsel for the applicant, who himself refuted the claim that the applicant's medical condition precludes him from moving to another country or pursuing his business.""Otherwise also, the medical documents are old documents, which do not reflect any serious medical condition, which may entitle the applicant to the relief prayed by him,"" the court noted.Senior advocate Abhinav Mukherjee and standing counsel Surjendu Shankar Das appeared for the State of Goa. Special public prosecutor Atul Srivastava and additional public prosecutor Dr Sarita Rani appeared for Delhi State.The Goa Police filed a reply and opposed the pleas of the accused.They opposed the bail plea, and it was said that Gaurav Luthra, Saurav Luthra and Ajay Gupta are signatories. The Panchayat licence previously issued has expired and wasn't renewed.Goa Police stated that there is no cooperation from Saurav and Gaurav Luthra, thereby disentitling them from extraordinary protection by this court.""They have no business in Thailand. The family members did not disclose their whereabouts to avoid arrest. They left the country on December 7. Though they said that they had left on the night of December 6,"" Goa Police said.Goa police said that Saurav and Gaurav Luthra misled the court, misled the authorities and left the country, despite the fact that 25 people died in the incident.Medical grounds are bogus as the doctor did not see the patient. Still, they are saying that they are innocent, the Goa Police contended.""You (Luthras) are running the entire operation without a licence. There was only a narrow entry and exit. 25 people died in the incident. The extraordinary protection cannot be granted to applicants in the present case,"" the Goa Police added.""The application can be filed in Goa. Why did you (Luthras) come here?"" SPP Atul Shrivastava submitted.The accused's intention was not to cooperate as they booked the air tickets at 1.17 AM on December 7, immediately after the incident and left the country, SPP Shrivastava said.Senior advocate Tanvir Ahmed Mir, counsel for the accused, submitted that, according to the FIR, the incident was due to negligence and was not homicidal. There were people all around social media, and there was a threat to the applicant's life.Two restaurants have been bulldozed without notice, Senior Advocate Mir Submitted. I am before the court to protect life. A man before the court is not an absconder, Mir said.The perception of innocence is there under the law. The accused are not convicts; they are ready to join the investigation, Senior Advocate Mir added.He further said that no notice to join the investigation was given. A warrant was issued straight away, Mir Said.The managers manage restaurants all over India; the men sitting in Delhi cannot be present everywhere, Senior advocate Mir argued. Luthras had an event to attend in Phuket, therefore booked a ticket, he said.The property of the Accused is being bulldozed, there is sealing, we are seeking protection of life and liberty, Mir said. The men who are ready to join the investigation, the senior advocate said. Give them a helping hand, he added.Luthras has work in Phuket; I am seeking to employ Indian nationals there. Do I deserve to be lynched? Senior advocate argued. The properties were demolished after the incident; however, the show cause was issued before that, Mir said.To seek protection, I need to show that there is an immediate threat to my life, senior advocate Mir Said. Luthras are invoking the jurisdiction of the court where I live, Mir added. This court is my first protector, Mir said.Arrest cannot be made in a rage; it can't be made in vengeance, Mir said. Police have not stated why they require custody of the accused, as 90 per cent of the investigation is complete in my absence, Mir added.","Gaurav and Saurav Luthra, owners of Goa's Birch by Romeo Lane restaurant, expressed fears of being “lynched in Goa’ in their bail application.

He grabbed my cousin's collar and started speaking to us rudely.When we tried to apologise and leave, he called all the security personnel, the bouncers. They started chasing us and raised their hands at us. Since it was tough to leave that club, they chased us down and hit people in groups.

When my brother removed it, a bouncer ran towards him with a rod and started hitting him badly. When I pushed the bouncer to stop him, he hit me too. They were using such bad language towards us that I had never heard before. Since everyone was badly hurt, we decided to go to the Police station in the morning and not right away. I informed the Police, and they told us to come to the Anjuna Police Station the next day,"" Vaibhavi told news agency ANI.Somehow, an FIR was filed after a lot of effort. I had included the names of both owners in my complaint, but the Police later removed them, saying they were not physically present when this incident occurred, so they are not at fault. f you don't take women's safety and tourist safety seriously, such incidents will keep happening in Goa,"" she added further.Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of the fire-ravaged Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, were recently picked up by Thai police from Hotel Indigo in Patong, Phuket, days after fleeing India on an IndiGo flight as 25 people died in a blaze at their club.The brothers became 'persona non grata' in Thailand after their passports were suspended by the regional passport office in Delhi. Their travel documents were declared invalid after they failed to respond to a notice seeking reasons why action should not be taken against them, easing the execution of India’s request for their detention, officials said.","Authorities in Goa are revisiting safety concerns at Romeo Lane, a Vagator nightclub linked to the Luthra brothers. A tourist's months-old account of the venue’s unsafe layout resurfaced. Vaibhavi, who visited the club in November, described the nightclub as “suffocating” due to its single elevated entry and exit.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125925250,imgsize-25534,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/-.jpg"
Watch: Tax hikes fuel protests in Bulgaria; PM Zhelyazkov quits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/watch-tax-hikes-fuel-protests-in-bulgaria-pm-zhelyazkov-quits/articleshow/125924483.cms,"Anti-corruption protest







Bulgaria’s government resigned on Thursday, ending an increasingly unpopular coalition but threatening prolonged political instability on the eve of the country’s entry into the euro zone.Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov handed in his government’s resignation following weeks of street protests against state corruption and a proposed budget that would have raised taxes.The European Union and NATO member state held seven national elections over the past four years as consecutive governments failed to command a fractured parliament. The outgoing government, in power since January, had appeared set to oversee the transition to the euro on January 1, but Zhelyazkov bowed to public pressure and resigned, Reuters reported.Even Bulgaria’s largely ceremonial head of state, President Rumen Radev, had called for Zhelyazkov to stand down.The protests began in late November when Zhelyazkov’s three-party coalition proposed a draft budget that included increases in social security contributions and taxes on dividends to finance higher state spending.Some of the planned spending was earmarked for police, security services and the judiciary—the very bodies that many Bulgarians have come to despise after years of perceived corruption.Although the budget was withdrawn, popular anger persisted.“It was about time. Long overdue. There are certainly intelligent, sensible people (in parliament) who can come up with something meaningful and put an end to the abuses we’ve seen,” said IT specialist Hristiyan Marinov.Tensions were already high after a perceived crackdown on the liberal, pro-EU opposition saw Blagomir Kotsev, mayor of the coastal resort of Varna, jailed for months on allegations of corruption that he strongly denies.By Wednesday, tens of thousands of people had taken to the streets of cities and towns across Bulgaria, marking some of the largest anti-government gatherings since the end of communism in 1989. “This was an accumulation of things. The tension has been growing over time, and the budget was the tipping point,” said Dimitar Markov, director of the Law Program at the Center for the Study of Democracy in Sofia.Many protesters were urban professionals who back Bulgaria’s adoption of the euro and want the country to integrate with the European mainstream after a turbulent transition to democracy. Others fear that joining the euro will fuel inflation or oppose Bulgaria’s official pro-Western stance on issues such as the Ukraine war, preferring to repair ties with Moscow.“People realise that their will, when they express it, matters,” said Vessela Tcherneva, deputy director at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Sofia. “Whoever the next government is will be more aware and will need to be more accountable.”President Radev will now invite the largest party in parliament, GERB, to form a new government, but it may struggle to secure support in a fragmented assembly of nine parties. If GERB fails or declines, two other parties will be offered the chance. Should they also fail, President Radev will appoint an interim government and call a snap election, potentially plunging Bulgaria back into a cycle of repeated polls.“There is a great risk that we actually end up with another series of elections,” said Dimitar Markov.Bulgarians remain divided over the euro, and there is concern that without strict government oversight retailers may exploit public confusion over the conversion to raise prices. “The state has a critical role to make sure there are no major shocks to the system,” said Mario Bikarski, senior Europe analyst at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft. “In the absence of a budget and the absence of a government, the risks to the system are increasing quite a bit. ”","Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov handed in his government’s resignation following weeks of street protests.

Gas explosion hits San Francisco: Footage shows fireball-like eruption – video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gas-explosion-hits-san-francisco-footage-shows-fireball-like-eruption-video/articleshow/125923764.cms,"



A gas explosion triggered a major fire in the unincorporated community of Ashland near Hayward on Thursday after an underground line was damaged by a construction crew, fire officials said. At least one home was destroyed, windows were blown out and nearby houses shook.Six people were taken to hospital for treatment, Alameda County Deputy Fire Chief Ryan Nishimoto said. Three were sent immediately with serious injuries and three others had more minor injuries, AP news agency reported.Three structures on two separate lots were severely damaged, Nishimoto said. Some of the 75 firefighters on the scene were forced to back off momentarily after feeling electric shocks from fallen power lines.The video, which came from doorbell camera footage, showed a large building engulfed in flames and debris scattered across the area.“We were sitting in the house and it just ... everything shook. Stuff fell off the walls and when we looked at the camera it was like you were watching a war video,” said Brittany Maldonado, who lives across the street and provided the Nest doorbell cam footage to ABC7 News.The National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday it was sending a team to investigate.Pacific Gas & Electric Co was alerted at 7:35 a.m. that a construction crew not affiliated with the utility had damaged an underground gas line. Utility crews arrived to isolate the damaged line but gas was leaking from multiple locations. Workers stopped the flow of gas at 9:25 a.m., and the explosion soon followed.Gas was flowing for two hours but the explosion happened 10 minutes after the line was shut off, PG&E spokesperson Tamar Sarkissian confirmed. She said it took time to isolate the line and stop the flow of gas.The explosion occurred in Ashland, near the city of Hayward in the East Bay, about 15 miles south of Oakland. Hayward is home to about 160,000 residents.Sirens were heard as police arrived and flames spread at the site of the collapsed building. Several workers lifted a large piece of debris near an excavator that was digging in front of the home just before the blast.Rebecca Boone in Boise, Idaho, Julie Watson in San Diego and Christopher Weber in Los Angeles contributed to this report.","A gas explosion triggered a major fire in the unincorporated community of Ashland near Hayward.

Miami Mayoral Elections: Eileen Higgins becomes city’s first-ever female mayor - who is she?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/miami-elections-eileen-higgins-becomes-citys-first-ever-female-mayor-who-is-she/articleshow/125881328.cms,"AP file photo

Zelensky’s ‘Difficult Call’ With US Envoys As Territory Talks Hit Wall | 3-day Miami Talks Conclude

Who is Eileen Higgins ?









Miami voters have elected Democrat Eileen Higgins as the city’s first female mayor and the first Democrat to hold the office in nearly three decades.In Tuesday’s runoff, Higgins, a former county commissioner, defeated Republican Emilio González, a former city manager backed by former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.“Together, we turned the page on years of chaos and corruption and opened the door to a new era for our city, one defined by ethical, accountable leadership that delivers real results for the people,"" Higgins said in a statement after the voivtory, promising to lead a government “that finally earns the public’s trust,” as cited by NYT.Although Miami’s elections are officially nonpartisan, both major parties played an active role in the campaign. US President Donald Trump endorsed González, while the Democratic National Committee backed Higgins. In the days leading up to the vote, several prominent national Democrats traveled to Miami to campaign alongside her, an unusual show of support for a low-turnout, off-year local election.Higgins secured victory the victory after topping the first round of voting on November 4, where she received 35 per cent of the vote compared to González’s 19 per cent.Higgins will make history as Miami’s first female mayor and its first non-Hispanic mayor since the 1990s, breaking a three-decade dominance of Cuban American Republicans in city politics.Higgins, a trained mechanical engineer and former Peace Corps director in Belize, previously represented what she described as a Republican-leaning district on the county commission.She also holds a Master of Business Administration from Cornell University’s Johnson Graduate School of Management.On the campaign trail, she pledged to focus on addressing residents’ everyday concerns if elected, as cited by Politico.Higgins had served as a well-known county commissioner for eight years, representing a district that included Miami’s downtown. In the November 4 election, she also secured the top spot across all five of the city’s commission districts.She received a social media endorsement from former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, who is a former mayor and was a 2020 presidential candidate.She also led in all five of the city’s commission districts and will succeed outgoing Mayor Francis Suarez, who had briefly sought the Republican presidential nomination, as cited by the NYT.Miami, home to roughly half a million residents, is Florida’s second-largest city after Jacksonville. While the city, like the state, has trended Republican in recent election cycles, Higgins’ Democratic victory stands out as particularly notable.","Eileen Higgins, a former county commissioner, defeated Republican Emilio González in Tuesday's runoff.

Christmas To Decide Ukraine’s Fate? Trump’s New Deadline For Peace Deal Rattles Zelensky & EU Allies

US frustration grows as peace talks stall



Europe steps in as battlefield pressure rises







US President Donald Trump on Thursday delivered one of his strongest warnings yet about the Russia-Ukraine conflict, cautioning that the war’s current trajectory could push the world towards a catastrophic global confrontation. “Things like this end up in third world wars,” he said, urging an immediate halt to the fighting as he revealed that 25,000 people — “mostly soldiers” — were killed in the past month alone.Speaking at the White House after signing an Executive Order on artificial intelligence regulation, Trump said he was “working very hard” to stop the bloodshed and expressed deep frustration over the lack of progress in US-led negotiations. “I'd like to see the killing stop… I would love to see it stop,” he told reporters.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the President was “extremely frustrated with both sides of this war” and “sick of meetings just for the sake of meeting.” She confirmed that Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and his team were holding discussions with Ukrainian and Russian officials “literally as we speak,” but added that it remained “up in the air” whether the US would send a representative to talks scheduled for this weekend.Trump, who once claimed he could resolve the war “in a day,” has become increasingly vocal about his impatience. “He doesn’t want any more talk. He wants action. He wants this war to come to an end,” Leavitt said.Ukraine has put forward a 20-point plan detailing settlement terms, including separate documents on security guarantees. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Kyiv was grateful for Washington’s engagement but warned that territorial questions — such as control of the Donetsk region and the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant — remain far from resolved. Any concessions, he insisted, would require approval by national referendum.Ukrainian officials say the US has suggested a “free economic zone” in parts of the Donbas, while Russia frames the idea as a “demilitarised zone.” Kyiv is resisting any arrangement that would cement Russian influence. Zelenskyy said compromises under discussion included Ukrainian forces withdrawing from Donetsk on the condition Russian forces do not enter — but stressed that any pullback would require equal withdrawals by Russia.European leaders are scrambling to shape the negotiations amid concerns that Trump’s push for a rapid settlement could leave Ukraine at a disadvantage. Germany’s Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer and France’s President Emmanuel Macron have proposed finalising peace proposals with the US over the weekend, warning that the talks are now at “a critical moment.”Russia, meanwhile, is attempting to show it is responsive to Trump’s peace efforts, submitting new “collective security” proposals to Washington. On the battlefield, President Vladimir Putin claimed Russian forces were “fully holding the strategic initiative” and had captured the city of Siversk — a claim Ukraine denies.Ukraine also struck back with long-range drones, hitting a Russian oil rig in the Caspian Sea and forcing Moscow’s airports to halt flights for several hours.",US President Donald Trump delivered one of his strongest warnings yet about the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

Pardoned but still in prison? What’s really keeping Trump's ally Tina Peters locked up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pardoned-but-still-in-prison-whats-really-keeping-trump-ally-tina-peters-locked-up/articleshow/125923649.cms,"What Trump said?



Who is Tina Peters and what are her charges

Trump granted pardons but still she will stay in jail- why





US President Donald Trump pardoned Colorado’s former Mesa County clerk, Tina Peters, for her ""attempts to expose Voter Fraud"" in the 2020 presidential election in a Truth Social post on Thursday eveningTrump has been vocal about his intentions to free Peters — one of the nation’s most prominent 2020 election deniers — from her prison sentence, despite having no jurisdiction over state-level cases.Trump previously threatened to retaliate against the state of Colorado if Peters was not released, Axios reported.Trump accused Democrats of ignoring violent crimes and said that the party chose instead to prosecute anyone they can find that wanted Safe and Secure Elections.""For years, Democrats ignored Violent and Vicious Crime of all shapes, sizes, colors, and types. Violent Criminals who should have been locked up were allowed to attack again. Democrats were also far too happy to let in the worst from the worst countries so they could rip off American Taxpayers. Democrats only think there is one crime – Not voting for them! Instead of protecting Americans and their Tax Dollars, Democrats chose instead to prosecute anyone they can find that wanted Safe and Secure Elections,"" he said in a post on Truth Social.""Democrats have been relentless in their targeting of TINA PETERS, a Patriot who simply wanted to make sure that our Elections were Fair and Honest.Tina is sitting in a Colorado prison for the “crime” of demanding Honest Elections. Today I am granting Tina a full Pardon for her attempts to expose Voter Fraud in the Rigged 2020 Presidential Election!"" he added.Former Colorado clerk Tina Peters got involved with other activists who tried to prove Trump’s fraud claims by breaching voting systems in Colorado, Michigan, Georgia, and other states.After which, she was convicted of several felonies for allowing fellow election deniers access to local voting systems in search of voter fraud in the 2020 election, repeating Trump's debunked claims.Last week, a federal appeals court denied Peters' request for release from prison, the only ally of President Donald Trump behind bars for crimes related to the attempts to overturn the 2020 election.Last year, a state jury convicted her of participating in a criminal scheme with fellow election deniers to breach her county’s secure voting systems in hopes of proving Trump’s false claims of massive fraud.Despite Trump pardoned her, she could not come out of jail because of the fact that presidential pardons do not apply to state convictions, CNN news reported.","Tina Peters was convicted of several felonies for allowing fellow election deniers access to local voting systems in search of voter fraud in the 2020 election, repeating Trump's debunked claims.

The United States on Thursday imposed new sanctions on Venezuela, targeting three nephews of President Nicolas Maduro’s wife, along with six crude oil tankers and associated shipping companies.The action coincided with a large-scale US military buildup in the southern Caribbean and President Donald Trump’s campaign for Maduro’s ouster. On Wednesday Trump said the US had seized a sanctioned oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, Reuters reported.The US Treasury Department said in a statement it imposed sanctions on six shipping companies moving Venezuelan oil, and on six crude oil tankers that it said “have engaged in deceptive and unsafe shipping practices and continue to provide financial resources that fuel Maduro’s corrupt narco-terrorist regime.”Four of the tankers, including the 2002-built H. Constance and the 2003-built Lattafa, are Panama-flagged, with the other two flagged by the Cook Islands and Hong Kong. The targeted vessels are supertankers that recently loaded crude in Venezuela, according to internal shipping documents of state oil company PDVSA.Franqui Flores and Efrain Antonio Campo Flores, nephews of Venezuelan first lady Cilia Flores, were also sanctioned.The two were detained in Haiti in 2015 in a US Drug Enforcement Administration operation, convicted in 2016 of attempting a multimillion-dollar cocaine deal and sentenced to 18 years in prison, but released in a 2022 prison swap with Venezuela. A third nephew, Carlos Erik Malpica Flores, sanctioned for his alleged role in a corruption plot at PDVSA, was also designated.Wednesday’s seizure of a Venezuelan oil cargo was the first under US sanctions in force since 2019 and the first known tanker action by the Trump administration since the military buildup. The administration plans further tanker seizures, according to sources.US Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on X that the FBI, Homeland Security and Coast Guard, backed by the US military, carried out a warrant authorising the seizure of a crude tanker transporting sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran. The move sent oil prices higher and sharply escalated tensions between Washington and Caracas.President Maduro on Thursday slammed the US seizure of an oil tanker from his country, calling it an act of ""naval piracy"" that escalated tensions between Washington and Caracas.""They kidnapped the crew, stole the ship and have inaugurated a new era, the era of criminal naval piracy in the Caribbean,"" Maduro said at a presidential event, adding ""Venezuela will secure all ships to guarantee the free trade of its oil around the world.""Trump has repeatedly raised the possibility of military intervention in Venezuela, accusing it of sending narcotics to the United States. The US has already conducted more than 20 strikes against suspected drug vessels, raising concerns among lawmakers and legal experts.","U.S. sanctions three nephews of Venezuela's first lady, six oil tankers and associated shipping companies.

Wrongful deportation to El Salvador’s mega-prison



Government backlash and shifting deportation plans

Court cites the extraordinary history of the case





A federal judge has ordered the immediate release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from US immigration detention after finding he was held without lawful authority. Judge Paula Xinis said his custody had no legal basis because he has no valid removal order and the government has no workable plan to deport him.In her 31-page order, US District Judge Paula Xinis said that since Abrego Garcia’s “wrongful detention in El Salvador,” the government has “re-detained, again without lawful authority,” a man who lacks any valid removal order. She ruled that immigration law does not permit indefinite or punitive detention and that officials cannot hold him when no foreseeable removal is possible.The judge directed the government to notify Abrego Garcia of the time and location of his release and to inform the court once he has been freed from the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Pennsylvania.Abrego Garcia, a 30-year-old from El Salvador, has lived in Maryland with his wife and child. He was granted withholding of removal in 2019 after a judge found he would face persecution if returned to El Salvador.Despite that order, ICE deported him in March 2025 to El Salvador’s CECOT mega-prison after Trump officials alleged MS-13 ties, which he denies. The government later called the deportation an “administrative mistake.”He was brought back to the US in June 2025 to face human-smuggling charges in Tennessee, to which he has pleaded not guilty. After being released to his brother’s custody, ICE detained him again even though no lawful removal order existed.The Department of Homeland Security condemned the ruling as “naked judicial activism” and said it would appeal. Officials have attempted to remove him to Liberia and at various points notified him of planned expulsions to Uganda, Eswatini and Ghana. Judge Xinis said none of these options were realistic.She also noted that Costa Rica, his preferred country of removal, had repeatedly stated it would accept him and offer refugee protection. The court found that government efforts to exclude Costa Rica “backfired” when the country publicly reaffirmed its willingness.Xinis called the history of the case “extraordinary,” pointing to wrongful deportation, re-detention and inconsistent plans for removal. She stressed that immigration detention cannot serve as punishment and must be tied to a lawful, achievable removal process.Abrego Garcia will now return to supervision under the US Pretrial Services Office and will follow the release conditions in his Tennessee criminal case.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 30-year-old from El Salvador, has lived in Maryland with his wife and child.
