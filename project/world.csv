US President Donald Trump will cut short his visit to the Group of Seven summit in Canada and leave on Monday night due to the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, the White House announced.""Because of what's going on in the Middle East, President Trump will be leaving tonight after dinner with Heads of State,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X.She added that the president had “a great day at the G7, even signing a major trade deal with the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Keir Starmer.” Leavitt said, “Much was accomplished, but because of what’s going on in the Middle East, President Trump will be leaving tonight.”Tensions in the Middle East dominated talks among world leaders at the summit, held in Canada. The conflict between Israel and Iran entered its fourth day of violence, prompting urgent diplomacy.By Monday afternoon, Trump issued a stark warning on social media, saying: “Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!”The US president has repeatedly urged Iranian leaders to return to the negotiating table, saying they have failed to act even after being given time.“They have to make a deal,” he said, adding that Iranian leaders would “like to talk” but did not do so during the 60-day window before Israel launched its aerial strikes.“They are not winning this war,” Trump said of Iran. “And they should talk and they should talk immediately before it’s too late.” When asked if the US would consider military involvement, Trump responded, “I don’t want to talk about that.”Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, the summit’s host, described the moment as historically significant. “We’re gathering at one of those turning points in history,” he said. “The world’s more divided and dangerous.”Other G7 leaders moved quickly to respond to the crisis.

GANDHINAGAR: A plume of smoke rose above BJ Medical College on the sunny afternoon of June 12. Flames licked the crumpled fuselage of a jumbo jet. Screams pierced the air. Raju Patel, 56, didn't stop to think. When the sky fell, he stood up.Just minutes away, the construction businessman raced to the AI 171 crash site with his crew, arriving within five minutes of impact. ""For the first 15 to 20 minutes, we could barely get close. The fire was too intense,"" Patel said. ""But once the first fire brigade and 108 ambulances arrived, we jumped in to help.""With no stretchers in sight, they used sarees and bedsheets to carry the injured. ""We did what we could,"" he said. Authorities allowed Patel's team to stay on-site until 9 pm.As emergency services took control, Patel's team turned to what came next - combing the wreckage. Burned luggage lay scattered across the charred grounds. From the debris, they retrieved 70 tolas (over 800 grams) of gold jewellery, Rs 80,000 in cash, passports, and a Bhagawad Gita. All were handed over to the police.Minister of state for home Harsh Sanghavi said Sunday that all salvaged personal belongings are being documented and will be returned to the next of kin.""I'm just grateful we could do something,"" said Patel, whose volunteering history includes the 2008 Ahmedabad serial blasts. ""I was just 100m from the civil hospital when a bomb went off. But the destruction here... the flames...

US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was taken to a hospital in Washington, DC, on Tuesday after suffering an allergic reaction, according to officials from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).The 53-year-old cabinet member was transported by ambulance out of precaution and is now alert and recovering, a DHS spokesperson confirmed. “Secretary Noem had an allergic reaction today. She was transported to the hospital out of an abundance of caution. She is alert and recovering,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.Noem was admitted to the emergency room, where CNN reporters observed several Secret Service agents positioned at multiple entrances.Appointed to lead the department shortly after Donald Trump secured a second presidential term, Noem was confirmed by the Senate in late January. Her appointment followed a career as South Dakota’s governor and representative in Congress.Since taking over the DHS, she has become a key figure in enforcing Trump’s renewed focus on strict immigration controls. Under her leadership, the department has overseen troop deployments to the southern border and the use of emergency powers to facilitate mass deportations of undocumented migrants.In addition to overseeing immigration enforcement, Noem also manages the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), though she has recently called for the agency to be dismantled. She has repeatedly criticised FEMA as ineffective and unnecessary. Last week, Trump also stated his intention to phase out FEMA following the end of this year’s hurricane season.As news of her hospitalisation spread, messages of support poured in online.Bruce LeVell, former Executive Director of President Trump’s National Diversity Coalition, posted on X, “My dear friend @Sec_Noem, our fearless Secretary of Homeland Security, was just rushed to the hospital. My heart is with her during this challenging time, but I know her strength and determination will shine through. Please join me in keeping Kristi in your prayers for a swift and full recovery.“She has been tirelessly spearheading @realDonaldTrump initiative to uphold law and order and utilise ICE to keep our country safe from criminals. Let’s stand strong for her, just as she’s stood strong for America.”Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk also called on supporters to “Pray for Kristi”.","US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was taken to a hospital in Washington, DC, on Tuesday after suffering an allergic reaction.

Zack Cozart delivers strong message: He won’t back Trump if U.S. chooses war path







As global tensions escalate in the Middle East, particularly between Iran and Israel, the political discourse in the United States is starting to reflect the unease. One unexpected voice has emerged from the sports world, signaling a strong personal stance—former MLB All-Star Zack Cozart has publicly warned that his support for Donald Trump could vanish if the president initiates a new war.Zack Cozart, who earned All-Star honors in 2017 and was once a vocal backer of Trump, used his platform on social media to issue a clear message. “If Trump gets us in a war, I will no longer support him, and I’m sure most of you know I love Trump,” he declared in a candid post on X. The statement marks a notable shift from his previous support, which had been emphatic and unwavering.Just last year, ahead of the 2024 presidential election, Cozart made no effort to hide his excitement. “I dunno bout yall but I can’t wait to vote for Trump… I’ve honestly never seen the party as united as now… they tried to kill our President … least we can do is VOTE!!” he wrote, reflecting his deep alignment with the Republican cause.But with President Trump closely monitoring the brewing Middle East conflict, the stakes have changed. His press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, acknowledged on Monday that Trump left the G7 summit early to “attend to many important matters,” citing ongoing developments in the region.The situation has become increasingly volatile, prompting Trump to make bold declarations. He urged citizens to evacuate Tehran and stated, “I’m not too much in the mood to negotiate,” while emphasizing the need for “a real end, not a ceasefire.” This hardline posture may be driving even staunch supporters like Cozart to reconsider their allegiance.Cozart didn’t stop with one post. He later shared another message, hinting at a sense of disillusionment among Republican voters. The tone suggested frustration over what some perceive as misplaced priorities—foreign entanglements over domestic issues.For a figure once so invested in Trump’s political journey, Cozart’s statement feels like more than just a fleeting opinion—it reflects a deeper concern over the consequences of military action. While war is far from certain, it’s clear that even loyal followers are prepared to speak out if they believe the country’s direction veers off course.Also Read: Bryan Reynolds rushes out of Pirates-Tigers game as his wife goes into labor mid-match","Former MLB All-Star Zack Cozart has publicly warned that his support for Donald Trump could vanish if the president initiates a new war.

PM Modi at G7



G7 on Migrant Smuggling



Condemning Transnational Repression



Zelenskyy appeals for Support



France to host next summit







On Day 2 of the G7 summit in Kananaskis on Tuesday, the remaining leaders continued with key discussions on terrorism, human smuggling, and the war in Ukraine, after Trump exited Monday night, saying he needed to focus on rising tensions between Iran and Israel.Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the Outreach Session and held several bilateral meetings. G7 members issued strong joint statements on migrant smuggling and transnational repression, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed for more global support amid fresh Russian attacks.Prime Minister Narendra Modi called his discussions with G7 leaders “productive”, saying they focused on global challenges and hopes for a better world.He held meetings with Canadian PM Mark Carney, UK PM Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, Italian PM Giorgia Meloni, and Australian PM Anthony Albanese. They spoke about strengthening trade ties and boosting cooperation in economic matters.India and Canada also agreed to appoint new high commissioners to normalise consular and trade services, after a period of diplomatic strain.At the G7 Outreach Session, Modi repeated India’s firm stand against terrorism. He urged world leaders to act strictly against those who support or promote it. He also raised concerns of the Global South, asking the G7 to address them more seriously.The G7 countries released a joint statement renewing their pledge to stop migrant smuggling. This comes under the G7 Coalition and their 2024 Action Plan.The leaders committed to stronger border management and targeting criminal networks involved in human smuggling and trafficking. They also noted links between smuggling and other crimes like money laundering and drug trafficking, calling it a threat to public safety.The G7 also took a joint stand against transnational repression—acts by foreign states to threaten or silence people living abroad.Calling it a growing threat, the statement described it as an attack on sovereignty, national security, and human rights. It said such actions often target journalists, dissidents, activists, and religious minorities, especially those in diaspora communities.The leaders agreed to coordinate efforts to stop this trend and uphold international law.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy joined the second day of the summit as Russia launched one of its biggest attacks since the war began—killing 15 people and injuring more than 150.“It was a very difficult night,” Zelenskyy told leaders. He asked for continued military and diplomatic support, and said Ukraine is ready for peace talks, but only if pressure is applied on Russia for an unconditional ceasefire.Canadian PM Carney said the attack “underscores the importance of standing in total solidarity with Ukraine”.French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France will host the next G7 summit in June 2026. The meeting will take place in the Alpine spa town of Évian-les-Bains. Macron said the focus would be on maintaining unity among G7 nations and working closely with trusted partners to increase their influence on global issues.",Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the Outreach Session and held several bilateral meetings.

'The battle begins': Iran's Khamenei hits back at Trump's threats; US may join strikes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/the-battle-begins-khamenei-vows-to-show-no-mercy-after-trumps-threats-iran-launches-ballistic-missiles-at-israel/articleshow/121920127.cms,"



Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in series of posts on early Wednesday warned the ""terrorist Zionist regime"" and said “the battle begins” amid escalating tensions with Israel. Khamenei's post came following escalating threats from US President Donald Trump, who had just hours before called for Iran’s “unconditional surrender.""Moments later, Khamenei posted on X: “We must give a strong response to the terrorist Zionist regime. We will show the Zionists no mercy.” The statement came shortly after Iran launched two rounds of ballistic missiles at Israel early Wednesday.Khamenei’s posts appeared to frame the attacks as part of a broader ideological struggle. In Farsi, he posted “the battle begins”, alongside an image of a man with a sword entering a castle gate, alluding to the historic battle of Khaybar, as per the Times of Israel.In a series of posts on his platform Truth Social Trump had claimed the United States had full control of Iranian airspace and warned that the country’s top leader was within reach. “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,” Trump had wrote.“But we don’t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” He later followed up with a post calling for Iran's “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!”Iran fired the latest barrage of missiles around 12.40 am which triggered sirens across of Israel and included around 15 projectiles. A second wave of about 10 rockets followed roughly 40 minutes later, prompting alerts in central parts of the country and the West Bank. Although there were no reported casualties, a fire broke out in a central Israeli parking lot, damaging several cars.Warning sirens were also activated around the Dead Sea due to what officials described as a suspected drone infiltration.Read: How Iran’s Supreme Commander Ayatollah Ali Khamenei lost his top commanders Meanwhile, Israel continued its offensive inside Iranian territory. Early Wednesday morning, the Israel defense forces (IDF) called for residents of Tehran’s District 18 to evacuate, citing upcoming military action targeting strategic infrastructure. Soon after, Israeli forces confirmed a new wave of airstrikes in Tehran. Reports also emerged of explosions in the city of Karaj, previously the site of a nuclear centrifuge facility targeted by Israeli strikes.Israel launched its military campaign six days ago, calling the assault necessary to dismantle what it described as an “existential threat” posed by Iran’s nuclear and missile programmes. According to Israeli officials, the ongoing operation aims to eliminate top Iranian military officials, nuclear scientists, missile launch sites and uranium enrichment centres.The conflict has already caused significant casualties. Iranian authorities report at least 224 people killed in Israeli strikes, while Israel says over 370 missiles and hundreds of drones have been launched by Iran. So far, 24 people have been killed in Israel and more than 500 wounded.Also read: Donald Trump may consider joining Israel in striking Iranian nuclear sites; report claims growing US involvement","Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in series of posts on early Wednesday warned the ""terrorist Zionist regime"" Khamenei's posts appeared to frame the attacks as part of a broader ideological struggle.

'Extreme thuggery of Trump’s ICE': NYC mayoral candidate Brad Lander arrested at immigration court; watch video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/extreme-thuggery-of-trumps-ice-nyc-mayoral-candidate-brad-lander-arrested-at-immigration-court-watch-video/articleshow/121919443.cms,"(Source:X)





New York City Comptroller and Democratic mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested on Tuesday at a federal immigration court in Manhattan. He was taken into custody after linking arms with a man whom federal agents were attempting to detain.Journalists and photographers captured the incident.Lander had spent the morning observing court proceedings and said he was there to “accompany” immigrants as they left the building. As one man stepped out of a courtroom, federal agents moved in to arrest him. Lander locked arms with the individual and asked to see a judicial warrant.Agents spent over 40 seconds trying to pull the two apart, dragging them down the hallway in a messy struggle. They eventually separated them and put handcuffs on Lander.“You’re obstructing,” one agent told him.“I’m not obstructing. I’m standing right here in the hallway,” Lander responded.According to US Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, Lander was arrested “for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer.”The man Lander was escorting was also arrested. Lander was released after a few hours and walked out of the building holding hands with his wife and flanked by New York Governor Kathy Hochul, to cheers from supporters.He insisted he “certainly did not” assault anyone.“I am happy to report that I am just fine. I lost a button,” Lander told reporters. “I believe it is important to show up and bear witness and accompany people.”He added that the immigrant “ripped” from his arms “doesn’t have a lawyer” and will likely spend the night in a detention facility.The US attorney’s office confirmed it is reviewing the matter and will decide whether to press charges. “The safety and security of official proceedings, government officials, law enforcement officers, and all members of the public who participate in them is a core focus of our Office,” said spokesperson Nicholas Biase.The arrest comes as immigration agents conduct aggressive enforcement operations nationwide, often detaining immigrants outside courtrooms immediately after their cases are dismissed.Lander’s detention follows similar episodes involving other Democratic politicians. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested outside a detention centre last month, though his charge was later dropped. Rep. LaMonica McIver was charged with impeding officers at the same event. Last week, Senator Alex Padilla was physically removed from a press conference in Los Angeles for speaking out against raids.Lander’s rivals in the Democratic mayoral primary, now just days away, swiftly criticised his arrest. Former governor Andrew Cuomo called it an example of “the extreme thuggery of Trump’s ICE out of control.”Candidate Zohran Mamdani and governor Hochul both visited the scene, with Hochul likening the arrest to excrement in a post on X.","New York City Comptroller and Democratic mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested on Tuesday at a federal immigration court in Manhattan.

Israel-Iran war: Donald Trump may consider joining Israel in striking Iranian nuclear sites; report claims growing US involvement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/israel-iran-war-donald-trump-may-consider-joining-israel-in-striking-nuclear-sites-report-claims-growing-us-involvement/articleshow/121918496.cms,"



US President Donald Trump is weighing the possibility of US involvement in Israel’s ongoing strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, multiple officials familiar with the matter told CBS News.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One early Tuesday, Trump made his stance clear. “I’m not too much in the mood to negotiate with Iran,” he said, adding that his goal is a permanent solution: “an end, a real end, not a ceasefire.”Later, on Truth Social, Trump doubled down, calling for Iran’s “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!” and stating that the US knows “exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now.”US defence officials had made arrangements anticipating Trump's potential directive for the US Air Force to support Israeli fighter aircraft with refuelling during their operations over Iran, two sources told CNN.These sources indicated that this consideration partly explains why more than 30 aerial refuelling tankers have been deployed to the region in recent days.Refueling Israeli jets midair would be one of the least aggressive forms of support.Still, CENTCOM has presented Trump with the possibility of joint US-Israel strikes on nuclear facilities.Vice President JD Vance echoed the urgency, posting on X that Trump “may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment. That decision ultimately belongs to the president.”Trump met with his national security team in the White House Situation Room on Tuesday. Israeli officials, who have been urging US involvement, expressed optimism but said no formal decision from the US had been conveyed yet.While Trump had previously avoided direct military involvement beyond missile defense and intelligence sharing, his recent statements — including “we now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran” — suggest a shift.“Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment, and plenty of it, but it doesn’t compare to American made, conceived, and manufactured ‘stuff.’ Nobody does it better than the good ol’ USA,” he wrote on Truth Social.After Israel launched strikes on Iran early Friday, it claimed Iran was rapidly advancing toward building nuclear weapons.However, a US intelligence report earlier this year said Iran was not pursuing a nuclear bomb, though mounting pressure may be pushing the regime to restart its nuclear program.The International Atomic Energy Agency has reported that Iran has significantly increased its stockpile of near-weapons-grade uranium in recent months. Iran continues to insist its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.While President Trump has not confirmed direct US involvement, his recent posts on Truth Social have stirred speculation. Trump’s increasingly aggressive tone and use of the term “we” in reference to military actions have raised questions about the extent of American involvement.And one of the key targets being considered is Iran’s Fordo nuclear site, a heavily fortified uranium enrichment facility buried deep under a mountain. According to Brett McGurk, a former US official who served under four presidents, “Fordo is the crux of this thing.” Destroying it would deal a major blow to Iran’s nuclear ambitions, but only the US has the firepower to make that happen.Military experts agree that multiple precision strikes by American B-2 bombers would be needed in a carefully coordinated mission. The New York Times reports that the Pentagon has rehearsed this scenario, which involves dropping a series of bombs ""down the same hole"" to penetrate Fordo's deep underground structure.Fordo is located nearly 300 feet beneath a mountain and protected by heavy air defenses. It is widely believed to be Iran’s most likely site for developing nuclear weapons, as it is where Iran has enriched uranium and expanded its stockpile.","US President Donald Trump is weighing the possibility of US involvement in Israel’s ongoing strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, multiple officials familiar with the matter told CBS News.

Indian-origin ex-aide to Hillary Clinton; now married to George Soros’s son Alex Soros,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-huma-abedin-indian-origin-ex-aide-to-hillary-clinton-now-married-to-george-soross-son-alex-soros/articleshow/121915976.cms,"(Photo credit: X)

The New York Times

Who is Alex Soros?



Alex Soros, 39, is the chairman of the Open Society Foundations, the global philanthropic organization founded by his father, billionaire investor George Soros.

Raised in New York, Alex graduated from New York University in 2009 and earned a PhD in history from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2018.

In June 2023, he was named the heir to his father’s fortune and took over leadership of OSF and Soros Fund Management.

Who is Huma Abedin?



Huma Abedin, 48, is a longtime political aide and trusted confidante of Hillary Clinton.

Often called Clinton’s “second daughter,” she worked closely with her in various roles — from the White House to the US Senate and the State Department.

Born in Michigan to an Indian father and Pakistani mother, Abedin was raised in Saudi Arabia. She often credits her multicultural background for shaping her identity and perspective.

She started her political journey at 19, interning in the First Lady’s office in 1996, and steadily rose through the ranks to become one of Clinton’s most trusted aides.

Over the years, she held several prominent positions: senior advisor to Senator Clinton, traveling chief of staff during the 2008 presidential campaign, deputy chief of staff at the US State Department, and ultimately vice chair of Hillary for America in 2016.

Her final role with Clinton was as chief of staff. Though known for keeping a low profile, Abedin’s personal life has drawn attention.

She married former Congressman Anthony Weiner in 2010, but their relationship unraveled after multiple sexting scandals, The People reported. The couple separated in 2016 and divorced in 2017. They share a son, Jordan Zain Weiner, born in 2011.

She briefly dated actor Bradley Cooper before meeting Alex Soros at a mutual friend’s birthday party in 2023.

The two got engaged in May 2024 and recently married in a high-profile wedding attended by political heavyweights and celebrities alike.

'They are guilty as sin': Elon Musk slams media companies; dares both 'to take drug tests & publish' after he tests negative,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-are-guilty-as-sin-elon-musk-slams-media-companies-dares-both-to-take-drug-tests-publish-after-he-tests-negative/articleshow/121914382.cms,"



Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Tuesday hit back at media companies, posting his own negative drug test results and challenging “The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal to take tests and publish the results. ”Musk posted a photo of his lab test results on X with a simple caption “lol,” showing negative results for several substances including ketamine, cocaine, and amphetamines. The post came just weeks after a New York Times bombshell report, which alleged that Musk had used a “cocktail” of substances while serving in a government advisory role.Responding to a repost, Musk doubled down, writing: “New York Times lies as easy as breathing. It’s normal for them.”In a separate post, he threw down a public challenge: “Great idea. I hereby challenge the NYT and WSJ to take drug tests and publish the results!”“They won’t, because those hypocrites are guilty as sin,” he sharply added.Musk also accused WSJ of falsely reporting that Tesla’s board was seeking a new CEO, calling it another example of unreliable journalism.Musk has tested negative for fentanyl, ketamine, and more than 22 other substances, including amphetamines, benzodiazepines, ecstasy, opioids, cannabis, cocaine, and ketamine, according to lab results he shared.The screening was conducted at Fastest Labs of South Austin, Texas on June 11, according to the shared documentation.Musk had previously acknowledged receiving ketamine prescriptions for depression treatment.The results follow intense media scrutiny and a bombshell New York Times report that claimed Musk was regularly using ketamine, ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms, and kept a daily pillbox with around 20 different drugs, including Adderall.The report even alleged the ketamine use had started affecting his bladder.He also reposted a user who quipped, “If Elon is on any drugs, I want what he’s having,” and later shared his test results with a single-word caption: “lol.”Musk had earlier dismissed these claims, saying, ""I tried prescription ketamine a few years ago and said so on X, so this is not even news,"" he posted. ""It helps for getting out of dark mental holes, but haven't taken it since then,"" he added.The controversy came to a head recently when US President Donald Trump called Musk a “big-time drug addict.”Earlier, in his final Oval Office press conference last month, Musk appeared with a black eye, which he said was caused by his 5-year-old son—and brushed off drug-related questions, telling reporters to “Move on!”","Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted his own negative drug test results on Tuesday.

NAGPUR: A simple act of courtesy and kindness — letting a sick teenager and her grandmother board the helicopter first — spared the lives of a couple from the fatal helicopter crash near Kedarnath on Sunday. Pooja and Pravin Mahajan, from Bhadravati in Chandrapur district, had been travelling with Pooja's sister, Shraddha Jaiswal of Wani in Yavatmal district, her husband Rajkumar, and their two-year-old daughter Kashi, who were among the seven killed when the chopper went down minutes after take-off.On Sunday morning, the group was waiting at the Kedarnath helipad with the Jaiswals for the first sortie to Gaurikund when an elderly woman in the queue requested that she and her unwell granddaughter be allowed to go first.

In January 2024, he had hosted widely-attended ‘Kashi Shiv Mahapuran Katha' in Wani. The event was inspired by his daughter's name Kashi, said sources.

Thane: Mumbra resident Mohd Irfan Ansari never imagined that buying his dream home — by investing savings and mortgaging ancestral jewellery — would leave him homeless within a year. Ansari is one of hundreds of residents who purchased homes in one of the clusters of buildings declared illegal behind the Khan Compound area in Shil, along the Mumbra-Diva fringe.The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld a Bombay high court order to demolish the illegal buildings.As families packed to relocate, emotions ran high. ""Where were the authorities when these buildings were being constructed? Officials who allowed this must be held accountable,"" said Abdur Rehman, criticising the lack of political response.A visit to the area in the evening revealed that some buildings were already demolished, while others awaited their turn. Ansari, a resident of the Madina Complex, expressed disbelief. ""We moved here for a better life. We had power connections, which gave us no reason to suspect anything was illegal,"" he said.Buyers were lured by affordable prices and grand facades, despite poor infrastructure and the area's remote location — nearly a kilometre from the Mumbra-Panvel highway.The locality lacks proper roads, streetlights, and even an official name, relying instead on neighbouring areas for identification.Firoz Khan, who relocated from Mumbai, lost his two shops and a 1-BHK flat in the demolition. ""I trusted the documents shown to us. Many of my relatives bought flats here. Now everything's gone, and we still hope the courts might offer relief,"" he said.Sakina Khan, also of Madina Complex, said, ""We sold our farmland in UP for a better life in Mumbai. Now it's all in ruins."" With power snapped since last week, some residents rely on generators. Nearby, Mohd Zainul Abdi cared for an elderly heart patient amid the ongoing chaos.The demolition drive is scheduled to continue under the direction of the Thane Municipal Corporation, as per high court orders. However, commissioner Saurabh Rao did not comment on the next steps.","Mumbra resident Mohd Irfan Ansari never imagined that buying his dream home would leave him homeless within a year.

BUENOS AIRES: A federal court on Tuesday granted a request by former Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner to serve a six-year prison sentence for corruption at her home in Buenos Aires.Judges ruled that Fernandez, 72, can serve time in the apartment where she lives with her daughter and her granddaughter, citing her age and security reasons. Fernandez was the victim of an attempted assassination three years ago.In the ruling, obtained by The Associated Press, the court said Fernandez ""must remain at the registered address, an obligation that she may not break except in exceptional situations.""The court also ordered Fernandez be placed under the watch of an electronic surveillance device to monitor her movements.Last week, Argentina's highest court upheld Fernandez's sentence in a ruling that permanently banned her from public office over the corruption conviction that found she had directed state contracts to a friend while she was the first lady and president.The ruling against Fernandez, Argentina's charismatic yet deeply divisive ex-leader, sent her supporters pouring into the streets of Buenos Aires, Argentina's capital, and blocking major highways in protest.The ruling barred Fernandez from running in this fall's Buenos Aires legislative election just days after she launched her campaign.On Tuesday, the court dismissed prosecutors' request that Fernandez serve time behind bars. Judges said that the physical integrity of the political leader ""would become complex in a situation of prison confinement in coexistence with any type of prison population.""Seeking to serve the sentence at home, the former president had argued that she is more than 70 years old - an extenuating circumstance taken into account by the justice system to grant the privilege.Fernandez dominated Argentine politics for two decades and forged the country's main left-wing populist movement known as Kirchnerism - after her and her husband, former President Nestor Kirchner. She rejects the charges as politically motivated.During Fernandez's eight years in office from 2007-2015, Argentina expanded cash payments to the poor and pioneered major social assistance programs. Her governments funded unbridled state spending by printing money, bringing Argentina notoriety for major budget deficits and sky-high inflation.Critics blamed Argentina's years of economic volatility on Fernandez's policies, and outrage over successive economic crises and the country's bloated bureaucracy helped vault radical libertarian President Javier Milei to the presidency in late 2023.Fernandez was embroiled in multiple corruption scandals during her tenure. She was convicted in 2022 of corruption in a case that centred on 51 public contracts for public works awarded to companies linked to Lazaro Baez, a convicted construction magnate and friend of the presidential couple, at prices 20% above the standard rate in a project that cost the state tens of millions of dollars.Fernandez has questioned the impartiality of the judges. She claimed that her defence didn't have access to much of the evidence and that it was gathered without regard to legal deadlines.Fernandez faces a series of other upcoming trials on corruption charges.","Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner allowed to serve corruption sentence at home.

Delhi Judge Cash Row: Modi Govt Likely To Move Impeachment Motion Against Justice Varma

NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha MP and senior advocate Kapil Sibal on Tuesday called Justice Yashwant Varma ""one of the finest judges"" and criticised the central government for initiating impeachment proceedings against Varma, in whose storeroom a huge amount of cash was found.Saibal alleged that the government's ""real motive"" behind the action against Varma is to ""dismantle"" the Collegium system and ""gain control over judicial appointments"".He also accused the government of selectively pursuing the case against Varma while ignoring similar proceedings against Justice Shekhar Yadav, who faces an impeachment notice from Opposition MPs over allegedly ""communal"" remarks made last year.""I can say with the utmost of responsibility that he (Varma) is one of the finest judges that I have argued before. You ask any lawyer in the High Court or the Supreme Court, and there is not a whiff of any wrongdoing by this judge. You ask any lawyer in Allahabad (Prayagraj)...judges know their lawyers...lawyers also know the judges,"" Sibal was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.He furher said: ""It is shocking that you (the government) are targeting a judge against whom there is no evidence and you are protecting a judge against whom there is no evidence required because his statement is in the public domain and there is an impeachment motion pending before the Chairman and he has been sitting on it for verification of signatures.""Rijiju is reportedly planning to introduce a motion on the first day of the upcoming Monsoon session of Parliament to make the Supreme Court's in-house inquiry report on Justice Varma public.""For what? Why are you protecting Shekhar Yadav?"" Sibal questioned.The senior advocate alleged that the opposition is failing to recognise the broader agenda to strip the Collegium of its authority and reinstate the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC).""This is the whole purpose of this exercise,"" Sibal claimed.Criticising the government’s handling of the matter, Sibal said a decision was taken against a sitting high court judge without following due process.""The judge was not even heard. This is absolutely shocking...Unfortunately, the political class is brought into the act,"" he remarked.The controversy surfaced after a fire incident at Justice Varma's residence in Delhi in March, during his tenure at the Delhi high court. The blaze reportedly led to the discovery of several burnt sacks of cash in an outhouse on the property.However, contrary to Sibal's claims, a three-judge inquiry panel's damning report to CJI Sanjiv Khanna confirmed that a huge amount of cash was found in a storeroom at Justice Yashwant Varma's Tughlaq Crescent residence on March 14.The report repudiated Justice Varma's repeated statements claiming innocence about the discovery of money from a room within his official residence.","Rajya Sabha MP Kapil Sibal called Justice Yashwant Varma ""one of the finest judges"" Sibal criticised the central government for initiating impeachment proceedings against Varma.

Tehran has confirmed the use of hypersonic missiles against Israel as tensions between the two nations stretch into a sixth day. Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps announced that its latest assault, ""Operation Honest Promise 3"", involved Fattah1 hypersonic missiles, and claimed “complete control over the skies of the occupied territories. ”The development came as President Donald Trump issued his sternest warning yet to Tehran, saying the US knows the whereabouts of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei but is “not going to take him out—at least not for now.” Calling for Iran’s “unconditional surrender,” Trump also declared that America’s “patience is wearing thin.”Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps claimed Wednesday that it had deployed hypersonic Fattah1 missiles during a fresh wave of strikes on Israeli targets. In a statement aired on state television, the IRGC declared: “The 11th wave of the proud Operation Honest Promise 3” was underway, boasting it had gained “complete control over the skies of the occupied territories.” The Fattah1, capable of travelling at Mach 5, is designed to outmanoeuvre missile defence systems with a manoeuvrable reentry vehicle.President Trump intensified his rhetoric on Tuesday with a direct message aimed at Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.“We know exactly where the socalled ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding,” Trump posted on social media. “He is an easy target... but we don’t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers.” Trump called for Iran’s “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER,” adding, “Our patience is wearing thin.”In response to Trump’s threats and Israel’s strikes, Ayatollah Khamenei issued a defiant message on X, writing: “In the name of the noble Haidar, the battle begins.” He also vowed: “We must give a strong response to the terrorist Zionist regime. We will show the Zionists no mercy.” The message signals a hardening stance from Tehran as both sides brace for prolonged conflict.According to US officials speaking anonymously, Israel had proposed a plan to eliminate Khamenei early in the conflict. Trump reportedly rejected the plan, fearing it would further destabilise the region. While Israel believed it had a credible operation in place, White House officials advised restraint, emphasising the risk of deepening the conflict.According to Iranian media, Israel has targeted the Khojir missile production site near Tehran in its latest wave of strikes. The facility is considered essential to Iran’s ballistic missile programme and was previously struck by Israel in 2024. Tehran continues to launch retaliatory strikes, some of which have penetrated Israeli defences with deadly consequences.Despite the aggressive tone, Trump has not entirely ruled out diplomacy. He suggested Vice President JD Vance and special envoy Steve Witkoff could be dispatched to Iran for talks. However, Trump downplayed National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard’s earlier assessment that Iran wasn’t building a bomb, saying, “I think they were very close to having it.”The Embassy of Iran in India on Wednesday highlighted remarks by the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, claiming that there is no evidence Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons.In a post on X, the Embassy quoted Grossi as saying, ""What we reported was that we did not have any proof of a systematic effort (by Iran) to move toward a nuclear weapon."" The statement was part of an interview with CNN, also posted by Iranian Press TV.Grossi reiterated, ""What we informed and what we reported was that we did not have... any proof of a systematic effort to move into a nuclear weapon.""This comes amid conflicting reports. According to *The Times of Israel*, citing Hebrew media, Israeli intelligence recently discovered Iranian scientists had made significant advances in nuclear weapon design, potentially placing Iran just weeks away from producing a bomb.The US State Department also weighed in, reaffirming President Trump’s firm stance. “Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon,” said spokesperson Tammy Bruce.Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told Congress earlier this year that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, and that Supreme Leader Khamenei had not reauthorised the country’s suspended nuclear weapons programme. However, President Donald Trump openly rejected that assessment, saying, “I don’t care what she said,” and insisted Iran was “very close” to building a nuclear bomb.Trump’s comments bring him in line with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who sees Iran’s nuclear capability as an imminent threat. Gabbard later downplayed the contradiction, telling CNN, “President Trump was saying the same thing that I said. We are on the same page.”In her March testimony, Gabbard said Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile was “unprecedented for a state without nuclear weapons,” but maintained that US intelligence had found no evidence of active weapon development.Military officials have noted that Iran could produce enough material for 10 nuclear weapons within weeks. A senior US official said Trump’s concerns were valid, as Iran’s uranium enrichment now far exceeds civilian energy needs.Israel has conducted extensive strikes on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure but has not yet destroyed the Fordo uranium enrichment facility, which lies deep underground.

A preview of Wednesday’s Tucker Carlson Show shows a fiery on-air argument between conservative host Tucker Carlson and Republican Senator Ted Cruz. The two clashed over US involvement in the ongoing Israel–Iran conflict, at one point shouting over each other.Cruz, who recently told Fox News it was “very much in the interest of America to see regime change” in Iran, faced sharp questions from Carlson..“How many people live in Iran by the way?” Carlson asked.“I don’t know the population,” Cruz replied.“You don’t know the population of the country you seek to topple?” Carlson pressed.“I don’t sit around memorising population tables,” Cruz shot back.“Well, it’s kinda relevant because you’re calling for the overthrow of the government,” Carlson responded.Their exchange grew more tense as they debated the ethnic makeup of Iran. “I am not the Tucker Carlson expert on Iran!” Cruz shouted.Carlson replied, “No you’re a senator who is calling to overthrow the country and you don’t know anything about the country!”Cruz accused Carlson of not knowing much either: “You're the one who claims they’re not trying to murder Donald Trump.” Carlson denied making such a claim and said he doubted Cruz believed that Iran was trying to assassinate Trump—arguing that if Cruz truly believed that, he would be pushing for direct US strikes.Cruz is one of several lawmakers, both Republican and Democrat, who support a more active US role in the conflict.Tucker Carlson has also turned against his former network and Donald Trump over their stance on the Iran–Israel conflict. Speaking on Steve Bannon’s War Room recently, Carlson accused Fox News of pushing propaganda to promote military escalation.“What they are doing is what they always do—turning up the propaganda hose to full blast and trying to knock elderly Fox viewers off their feet,” he said.Carlson criticised Trump directly, saying the US president had become “complicit in an act of war” following Israel’s missile strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.When asked about Carlson’s remarks during the G7 summit, Trump dismissed him with a jab: “I don’t know what Tucker Carlson is saying. Let him go get a television network and say it so that people listen.”Israel launched a major offensive against Iran last Thursday, striking its nuclear sites and top military leadership. The attacks damaged key infrastructure and killed several nuclear scientists. Iran responded with missile strikes of its own, escalating tensions further.

The United States will shut its embassy in Jerusalem from Wednesday through Friday as the conflict between Israel and Iran intensifies, the State Department announced on Tuesday.“Given the security situation and in compliance with Israel Home Front Command guidance, the US Embassy in Jerusalem will be closed tomorrow (Wednesday, June 18) through Friday (June 20). This includes the Consular Sections in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv,” the department said in a statement posted on X.The decision comes as military tensions continue to escalate between Iran and Israel, now in their sixth day of open conflict. Loud explosions were heard in both Jerusalem and Tel Aviv as missiles flew overhead, with video footage showing several strikes in residential areas.On Monday, minor damage was reported at the US Embassy’s Tel Aviv branch after missile impacts nearby, according to the US Ambassador to Israel. “Some minor damage from concussions of Iranian missile hits near embassy branch in Tel Aviv but no injuries to US personnel,” the ambassador confirmed. Windows of nearby homes and hotels were shattered by the blast’s shockwaves.No evacuation has been announced for American citizens in the region. However, embassy officials said, “all US government employees and their family members [must] continue to shelter in place in and near their residences until further notice.”The closures come amid growing speculation about a potential American military response. US President Donald Trump convened a meeting with his National Security Council on Tuesday after publicly calling for Iran’s “unconditional surrender.” He also warned that the US could assassinate Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei if it chose to.A Reuters report revealed that Trump had recently vetoed an Israeli plan to carry out such an assassination. “Have the Iranians killed an American yet? No. Until they do we're not even talking about going after the political leadership,” a senior US official was quoted as saying.Despite the ongoing crisis, the US has yet to make any formal announcement about evacuating citizens or engaging in direct military retaliation.","The US Embassy in Jerusalem will be closed from Wednesday through Friday, the State Department announced.

She repeated US President Trump's stance that Iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons.Trump is reportedly considering direct military involvement alongside Israel. According to CBS News, US defence and intelligence officials are closely watching Iran’s Fordo nuclear site. The underground facility is thought to be a key part of Iran’s uranium enrichment programme.On Tuesday, air raid sirens sounded across northern Israel as Iranian missiles were detected. This marked the seventh wave of alerts since midnight, according to the Israeli military.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued an urgent alert asking residents of District 18 in Tehran to leave the area.The IDF said it planned further strikes on Iranian military infrastructure there.Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps said it used Fattah-1 hypersonic missiles in its latest round of attacks.

In a significant humanitarian gesture, the United Arab Emirates has waived all overstay fines for Iranian nationals, including both residents and visitors, regardless of the visa category under which they entered the country. The announcement was made on Tuesday, June 17, by the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP).The authority clarified that this decision was made “in response to the exceptional circumstances that the region is witnessing and to provide relief to this group of people who were unable to return to their homeland, due to the closure of airspace and the suspension of flights.”This move follows days of escalating conflict in the Middle East. Since Friday, Israel and Iran have been engaged in a direct air conflict, with Israel launching attacks on nuclear and military sites within Iran. In response, Iran has fired missiles into Israeli territory. As of Tuesday, the conflict has entered its fifth day, severely disrupting commercial air traffic and stranding travelers across the region.The exemption for Iranian nationals was issued under the directives of UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.The ICP said that the directive aims to provide immediate support to Iranian citizens affected by the conflict-induced travel disruptions.The decision applies to all Iranians present in the UAE, regardless of their visa type or duration of stay. It is part of a broader strategy by the UAE to respond swiftly to international humanitarian needs caused by conflict or crisis.To avail of the waiver, Iranian nationals are encouraged to register through the UAE's smart services platform or visit ICP customer happiness centres located across the country. The exemption is not automatic and requires eligible individuals to complete the registration process.The ICP confirmed that the exemption will remain in effect until December 31, 2025. This generous timeframe offers relief and flexibility for Iranian nationals unable to return home due to airspace closures and geopolitical instability.This is not the first time the UAE has taken such measures in response to conflict. Just last month, Sudanese nationals in the UAE were also granted full exemption from fines related to both residence and entry permits. That policy took effect on May 19, 2025, and was similarly aimed at easing the humanitarian burden caused by the crisis in Sudan.The ICP emphasized that both the Iranian and Sudanese exemptions reflect the UAE's ongoing commitment to supporting affected communities and align with its national efforts to strengthen social and humanitarian well-being among residents.","The United Arab Emirates has waived all overstay fines for Iranian nationals.

Iran retaliates with over 100 missiles and drone strikes





The conflict between Israel and Iran continued to escalate for a fifth day pushing the region to the edge of a full-scale war. Over the night the region witnessed marked missile exchanges, drone interceptions and urgent evacuation orders.As air raid sirens blared in Israel and explosions lit up the skies over Tehran, US President Donald Trump cut short his appearance at the G7 summit in Canada, warning civilians to “immediately evacuate Tehran.” He later posted from Air Force One that “IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON,” signalling an increasingly hardline stance.With death tolls rising, evacuation orders issued for hundreds of thousands, and regional airspace grinding to a halt, the situation has sparked fears of a much larger regional conflagration. Despite the bloodshed, Trump insists Iran still wants a deal, even as his military team gathers in Washington and Israel claims total control over Iranian skies.The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have announced the elimination of Ali Shadmani, Iran's newly appointed wartime Chief of Staff, in a targeted airstrike on central Tehran. The IDF stated that following ""a sudden opportunity overnight,"" Israeli Air Force fighter jets struck a manned command centre, killing Shadmani, who was described as ""the most senior military commander and the closest figure to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.Shadmani had assumed his position just days earlier, succeeding Gholam Ali Rashid, who was also killed in an Israeli strike. The IDF noted that Shadmani had commanded both the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Iranian armed forces, and his death represents a significant blow to Iran's military leadership. This operation marks the second such elimination within five days, following the death of his predecessor.The ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Tuesday confirmed that Indian students in Tehran have been moved out of the city for safety reasons, with arrangements made by the Embassy of India. In light of the worsening security situation, other Indian residents who are self-sufficient in terms of transport have also been advised to relocate to safer areas outside the capital.“Indian students in Tehran have been moved out of the city for reasons of safety, through arrangements made by the Embassy. Other residents who are self-sufficient in terms of transport have also been advised to move out of the city in view of the developing situation,” the MEA said.The ministry also stated that some Indian nationals had been assisted in leaving Iran through the border with Armenia.The Embassy remains in regular contact with the Indian community and continues to offer all feasible assistance. “Further advisories may be issued given the fluid situation,” the MEA added.The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that Iran had launched another salvo of missiles toward Israel in the early hours of Tuesday. Air raid sirens sounded across northern Israel, and residents were ordered to take shelter. While the IDF’s defence systems intercepted many of the missiles. “We will defend American interests,” said White House spokesperson Alex Pfeiffer, confirming US forces remained in a defensive posture. Despite the fresh attacks, there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage from the latest barrage.From Canada’s G7 summit, President Donald Trump issued a warning: “Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!” He reiterated on Truth Social that “IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON,” and blamed Iran for not signing the deal he had proposed. Soon after the post, the White House announced Trump would return to Washington ahead of schedule “because of what’s going on in the Middle East.” National Security Council members were called into the Situation Room as Trump signalled the US would remain on high alert.The G7 summit in Canada saw a major rift as President Trump refused to endorse a joint statement calling for de-escalation. European leaders, including Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer, had pushed for a unified message affirming Israel’s right to self-defence and condemning Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Trump’s refusal blocked consensus. According to CNN, Trump had given Iran a two-month ultimatum earlier this year, and the current strikes were timed to follow that deadline. His exit from the summit symbolised the shifting priorities of US foreign policy amid a rapidly widening conflict.On Monday, Israel’s military issued a mass evacuation warning to around 330,000 people in central Tehran, targeting an area that includes Iran’s state TV headquarters, police buildings, and three major hospitals—one linked to the Revolutionary Guard. The warning comes as part of Israel’s ongoing air campaign against Iran, which has already prompted large-scale displacement.Tehran, home to roughly 9.5 million people, has seen a surge in people fleeing the city. One resident, Alireza, told The Washington Post he left for Gilan province after an airstrike hit near his home: “We were lucky to leave very early… the roads got really crowded.”Both The Post and The New York Times reported long queues at petrol stations, with some resorting to rationing, after Israel targeted vital energy infrastructure including refineries and fuel depots.China’s embassy in Israel on Tuesday urged its citizens to leave the country “as soon as possible” . In a statement on WeChat, the embassy advised Chinese nationals to exit via land border crossings, “on the precondition that they can guarantee their personal safety,” adding, “It is recommended to depart in the direction of Jordan.” The embassy warned that the conflict is “continuing to escalate,” noting, “Much civilian infrastructure has been damaged, civilian casualties are on the rise, and the security situation is becoming more serious. ”Air travel was thrown into chaos as airspace closures rippled across the region. Iran’s skies remain entirely shut, while Israel closed Ben Gurion Airport “until further notice.” Airports in Iraq and parts of Lebanon also shut down, leaving tens of thousands stranded. “The domino effect here is massive,” aviation safety expert John Cox told AP. Flights were grounded, crews misplaced, and airlines faced mounting losses as the region braced for further escalation.Despite the military escalation, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told Fox News that President Trump was still open to a nuclear deal with Iran. “We are postured defensively in the region to be strong in pursuit of a peace deal,” Hegseth said, confirming he was en route to the Situation Room to brief the president. Trump echoed the sentiment at the G7, suggesting Iran was “at the negotiating table” and that “a deal will be signed.” Yet his statements were coupled with warnings and calls for evacuation, reflecting a dual-track strategy.Iran’s counter-offensive has grown fiercer. The Islamic Republic fired over 100 ballistic missiles overnight, bringing the total launched since Friday to more than 370. Iranian officials also confirmed three drone strikes on the South Pars gas complex, the country’s main production hub. The attacks, they said, were in direct retaliation for Israeli airstrikes that have so far killed at least 224 people in Iran. Officials vowed further responses to what they termed “aggression against the homeland.”","The conflict between Israel and Iran continued to escalate for a fifth day pushing the region to the edge of a full-scale war.

HELLSCAPE Tel Aviv! Iran’s Terrifying Attack Quakes Israeli City; IDF ‘Fails’ To Intercept Missiles

'Evacuate NOW': Iran's Terrifying BOMBING Threat To Israeli Media Houses After State TV Attack





Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday accused Iran of pushing the region toward a ""forever war"" and warned the situation is approaching the ""brink of a nuclear war.""In a wide-ranging interview with ABC News, Netanyahu argued that the only way to end hostilities is by directly targeting the Iranian regime's leadership - including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.When asked about reports that US President Donald Trump rejected an Israeli proposal to assassinate Khamenei due to fears of escalation, Netanyahu countered, ""It's not going to escalate the conflict, it's going to end the conflict.""The remarks come as tensions between Israel and Iran have surged since a wave of airstrikes and missile exchanges erupted late last week. Netanyahu squarely blamed Iran for regional instability, pointing to its alleged involvement in attacks across the Middle East.""We've had half a century of conflict spread by this regime that terrorizes everyone in the Middle East; has bombed the Aramco oil fields in Saudi Arabia; is spreading terrorism and subversion and sabotage everywhere,"" he said.""The 'forever war' is what Iran wants, and they're bringing us to the brink of nuclear war. In fact, what Israel is doing is preventing this, bringing an end to this aggression, and we can only do so by standing up to the forces of evil.""Asked directly if Israel would target Iran’s supreme leader, Netanyahu responded, ""We're doing what we need to do."" He added, ""I'm not going to get into the details, but we've targeted their top nuclear scientists. It's basically Hitler's nuclear team.""Netanyahu appealed to American interests, warning that the threat Iran poses is not limited to Israel. ""Today, it's Tel Aviv. Tomorrow, it's New York. Look, I understand 'America First'. I don't understand 'America Dead'. That's what these people want. They chant 'Death to America.'""""So we're doing something that is in the service of mankind, of humanity, and it's a battle of good against evil. America does, should, and does stand with the good. That's what President Trump is doing, And I deeply appreciate his support,"" he said.The Israeli leader also dismissed a Wall Street Journal report that Iran is seeking to de-escalate and resume nuclear talks. ""I'm not surprised. I mean, they want to continue to have these fake talks in which they lie, they cheat, they string the US along. And, you know, we have very solid Intel on that,"" he said. ""They want to keep on building their nuclear weapons and building their mass ballistic missile arsenal, which they're firing at our people. ""He rejected the idea of halting strikes in exchange for renewed diplomacy, adding, ""They want to continue to create the two existential threats against Israel while they're talking. That's not going to happen.""When asked about criticism from US conservatives like commentator Tucker Carlson who oppose military support for Israel, Netanyahu reiterated the global threat he believes Iran poses: ""Iran is a threat to the entire world.""The Israeli PM again echoed his recent birthday message to President Trump, saying, ""We're not just fighting our enemy. We're fighting your enemy. For God's sake, they chant, 'death to Israel, death to America.' We're simply on their way.

As night attacks stretch into Tuesday morning, global leaders express concern while military actions intensify between Israel and Iran. Confrontation have escalated sharply, with fresh explosions reported in Tehran late Monday night.State-linked Fars News Agency said Iran’s air defences were activated over the capital after blasts were heard in the eastern part of the city.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards announced the ninth wave of drone and missile strikes targeting Israel. A spokesman for the Guards said these attacks would continue “without interruption until dawn,” highlighting Iran’s intent to sustain pressure overnight.In a retaliatory warning, Iranian authorities have told Israel to evacuate the headquarters of Channels 12 and 14. This followed an Israeli airstrike on IRINN, a state-run television channel in Tehran on Monday, which forced a news presenter to flee during a live broadcast.Iranian authorities have claimed that they uncovered and shut down a drone manufacturing site in Tehran allegedly linked to Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency. According to Iranian state media, two individuals accused of working with Mossad were arrested in separate operations in Tehran and Alborz provinces.The Israel Defence Forces have confirmed missile detections across several areas following Iran’s latest wave of attacks. Sirens were activated as part of emergency procedures, and the Israeli Air Force has launched strikes on missile infrastructure in western Iran. Israeli officials claim to have achieved air superiority over Tehran, saying that a significant portion of Iran’s missile launchers has already been destroyed.The United States has moved quickly to adjust its military posture in the Middle East. Defence secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed the deployment of additional assets to the region, saying the move is meant to enhance the safety of American forces. In a statement on social media, Hegseth said, “Protecting US forces is our top priority”.Tehran has submitted a formal complaint to the United Nations, accusing Israel of deliberately targeting its nuclear facilities. In a letter to UN Secretary-General António Guterres and the Security Council, Iran’s representative, Amir Saeid Iravani, cited recent Israeli airstrikes on the Natanz nuclear complex and referred to a 1981 Security Council resolution condemning similar actions.Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has strongly criticised Israel’s actions, saying they undermine ongoing nuclear negotiations with the United States. During calls with foreign ministers from France, Britain, Germany, and the European Union, Araghchi said that Israel’s military aggression is “a blow to diplomacy.”US president Donald Trump has urged Iran to agree to a deal, repeating his warning that Iran must not be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. In a social media post, he told residents of Tehran to “immediately evacuate” and criticised Iran for not signing the deal he had earlier proposed. Despite the worsening crisis, Trump has not joined other G7 leaders in calling for de-escalation. The White House later confirmed that Trump would leave the G7 summit in Canada a day early to focus on the unfolding conflict.","Iran’s Revolutionary Guards announced the ninth wave of drone and missile strikes targeting Israel.

Israel Scrambles In STUNNING Drone 'Storm' Minutes After IDF Claims Air Supremacy Over Tehran





A growing sense of fear and panic has taken hold across Iran, particularly in the capital, Tehran, as Israel continues to vow further military strikes. Amid threats of new airstrikes, many Iranians are fleeing major cities in search of safety, with traffic jams clogging roads leading north toward the Caspian Sea.On Monday, the Israeli military issued a chilling warning, urging residents of Tehran to evacuate ""immediately.""""In the coming hours, the Israeli military will operate in the area, as it has in recent days throughout Tehran, to strike military infrastructure of the Iranian regime,"" the post read.A resident of Saadat Abad, an affluent neighbourhood in north Tehran that has reportedly been struck in recent days, described a night filled with explosions. ""Some were so powerful that the building shook,"" the resident told CNN anonymously, citing safety concerns. They described a chaotic scene as smoke poured into nearby buildings, and families rushed to the ground floors, struggling to calm frightened children.Iran's capital is ill-prepared for aerial conflict. Unlike Israeli cities equipped with modern bomb shelters, Tehran must rely on improvised options, basements, tunnels, and shelters dating back to the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s.""There weren't any shelters built in Tehran,"" said Mehdi Chamran, chairman of Tehran's city council. ""People went into basements. The metro could be used in an extreme crisis, but we would need to shut the system down.""Despite the looming threat, much of daily life continues. Grocery store shelves remain stocked, and events go ahead as planned. But long lines for fuel have become common, with gas rationed and capped at 25 litres per customer. Some ATMs are limiting cash withdrawals, residents say, adding to the tension.Cities beyond the capital are also showing signs of distress. In Shiraz, in south-central Iran, residents are lining up for gasoline and stockpiling essentials like water and diapers. Images show cars loaded with families and supplies heading toward rural areas.Nighttime in Tehran, however, tells a different story. Streets fall eerily quiet, many shops remain shuttered, and those who haven't left are increasingly reluctant to go to work.The situation follows a series of Israeli strikes on Iranian military infrastructure, including nuclear facilities in Natanz and Isfahan, which have heightened international concerns.","Israel issues chilling warning, urging residents of Tehran to evacuate ""immediately"" Iran's capital is ill-prepared for aerial conflict.

Gulf News

Travel Agents Respond to Sudden Demand for Rerouting



Airlines Adjust Routes, Travellers Worry Ahead of Summer Break



Geopolitical Background: Conflict Escalates in the Middle East







As regional tensions between Israel and Iran escalated into a four-day exchange of missile and drone strikes, UAE expatriates holidaying in several Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan, found themselves scrambling to return home, often at exorbitant costs.Following the outbreak of conflict, which began with Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites and escalated into retaliatory attacks that killed three in Israel, several airlines either suspended or rerouted flights across affected airspace. This has left many travellers stranded or forced to secure alternative, often indirect and expensive, flight options.Limnaz Musthafa, a long-time UAE resident working in Sharjah’s facility management sector, had sent his family on their first-ever trip to Baku, Azerbaijan. They arrived on June 12 via Air Arabia Abu Dhabi, but by June 13, just a day later, news of an Air India crash and intensifying conflict led to rapid flight closures.“If I knew this would happen, I would've cancelled their trip,” Limnaz Musthafa told, adding that he has been a UAE resident since 1986.By June 15, all return flights were cancelled. His six-member family, including an infant, was forced to book new tickets with Turkish Airlines for at least Dh6,000($1,635), in addition to the original Dh3,800($1,035) they had already spent.“The fear is there, due to the political situation our safety is compromised,” he told Gulf News from Baku, adding that airfares had “skyrocketed.”Similarly, Kamarudheen Arakkal, 43, faced stress when his son Rayan, a 25-year-old student in Birmingham, was stranded in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, after attending a football camp. Scheduled to return last Friday, the sudden closures meant his father had to secure a new flight via Qatar.“This caught us by surprise,” said Arakkal.The new ticket cost $1,000 (approximately Dh3,670), more than seven times the original Dh500 ticket.UAE-based travel agencies are working around the clock to rebook affected passengers using longer but safer routes. Raheesh Babu, Chief Operating Officer of Musafir.com, speaking to Gulf News, confirmed that travellers were turning to multi-leg flights via Istanbul or Doha to bypass closed or dangerous airspace.“People were caught off-guard,” said Babu, noting that the post-Eid travel boom to CIS countries due to affordable fares contributed to the scale of the issue.According to Babu, about 20 Musafir.com customers are currently booking alternative routes out of affected CIS regions.Afi Ahmad, Chairman of Smart Travels, said that most impacted tourists are stranded in Armenia and Azerbaijan, with others affected in Iran. Fortunately, he noted, the number of travellers returning immediately after Eid was not overwhelming due to a general dip in demand.“Unless it is an emergency, people don’t want to travel,” said Ahmad, highlighting the financial and emotional stress among stranded passengers.In one example shared by travel agents, a family managed to return to the UAE from Azerbaijan via Delhi, a longer and more expensive alternative.Despite the immediate disruptions, analysts say mass cancellations are not inevitable, provided airlines continue to find viable rerouting options.Saj Ahmad, Chief Analyst at StrategicAero Research, said that although a degree of reluctance to fly is expected, it may be balanced by broader geographic travel options and rerouting capabilities.GCC airlines, including Emirates, Etihad, Flydubai, and Air Arabia, can reroute westbound flights to Europe and North America via Egypt and the Mediterranean, and eastbound flights over Oman to the Arabian Sea. However, these detours can significantly increase travel time.The urgency and confusion stem from an escalating military conflict between Israel and Iran. Over a four-day period, Israel launched strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, prompting a retaliatory barrage of missiles and drones from Iran that killed three people in central Israel, including in Tel Aviv.Israel responded with a series of mass airstrikes, which, according to international reports, resulted in the deaths of several senior scientists and military generals within Iran.This violent exchange has ignited fears of a wider regional conflict and triggered urgent travel alerts and advisories from the UAE, Saudi Arabia , and other GCC nations.","UAE families stranded in CIS countries pay over Dh6,000 for rerouted flights via Istanbul, Doha, and Delhi amid Israel-Iran conflict flight cancellations.

'Iran Is Losing War With Israel': Trump's Big Claim Amid Tit-For-Tat Missile Strikes

Video: Iran State TV Bombarded During Live Broadcast; Anchor Screams, Flees Amid Israeli Attack

Why air superiority matters

What Russia couldn’t-and can’t-do

Why the difference?

“All the Russians have is pilots,” Stringer said. “They grow these pilots to drive flying artillery, and that’s it.”

Iran’s fatal miscalculation

The numbers game





In the fourth day of open war between Israel and Iran, both countries are reeling from mutual missile attacks, a mounting civilian toll, and a grim sense that the conflict has only just begun. Israeli jets struck Iranian military, nuclear, and command infrastructure as far east as Mashhad. Iran retaliated by launching hundreds of ballistic missiles and drones into Israeli cities, killing more than two dozen civilians and injuring hundreds.Yet despite the chaos, one strategic truth has crystallized: Israel now owns Iran’s skies. Israeli aircraft are flying unhindered over Iran’s capital, dropping bombs from within Iranian territory-something that the Russian Air Force has conspicuously failed to accomplish in Ukraine after more than three years of war. The contrast is not just tactical; it’s philosophical.The current war began Friday with a surprise Israeli strike that destroyed much of Iran’s top military command, set back its nuclear program, and cratered air defense installations across western Iran. Since then, Israeli air power has dismantled nearly a third of Iran’s surface-to-surface missile launchers and taken out key leaders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.Meanwhile, Iranian salvos continue to rain down on Tel Aviv, Haifa, and Petah Tikva, with civilian deaths rising by the hour.The destruction on both sides is immense. But Israel, unlike Russia, has secured the rarest-and arguably most decisive-military advantage in modern warfare: unchallenged control of enemy airspace.The Israeli campaign, as devastating as it is, also underscores a broader lesson about 21st-century warfighting: whoever controls the skies controls the tempo, scale, and eventual outcome of the fight.“The two campaigns are showing the fundamental importance of air superiority in order to succeed in your overall military objectives,” retired US Air Force Lt Gen David Deptula told the Wall Street Journal. “In the case of Russia-Ukraine war, you see what happens when neither side can achieve air superiority: stalemate and devolution to attrition-based warfare. In the case of the Israel-Iran war, it allows them unhindered freedom to attack where they possess air superiority over segments of Iran. ”That freedom has translated into a relentless bombing campaign using a blend of fifth-generation stealth F-35s-custom-modified by Israel-and older, more expendable F-15s and F-16s once Iran’s air defenses were degraded. Now, Israel is relying more on cheap, plentiful guided bombs like the JDAM and Spice kits instead of expensive long-range missiles. The effect: more strikes, lower cost, and more devastation.Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, Chief of Staff of the Israeli military, described the offensive with cold precision. “IAF pilots are flying at great risk to their lives, hundreds of kilometers away from Israel, striking hundreds of different targets with precision,” he said.The success stands in stark contrast to Russia’s ongoing frustrations in Ukraine. Despite possessing one of the largest air forces in the world, Russia has failed to establish air dominance over its neighbor. Its jets still do not operate freely over Kyiv or other major Ukrainian cities. Instead, the war has devolved into trench fighting, artillery duels, and long-range missile attacks-precisely the scenario Israeli planners worked to avoid.As per the WSJ report, one reason is qualitative. “The asymmetry in capability between Israel’s air force and Russia’s is vast and can be easily observed,” Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment and an expert on Russian and Ukrainian militaries, told the WSJ. Israeli pilots fly with tighter integration into cyber and intelligence operations. Their training emphasizes maneuver, autonomy, and real-time decision-making. Russian pilots, by contrast, fly what retired British Air Marshal Edward Stringer calls “flying artillery.”Israel’s air war has benefited from something else: Iran’s glaring strategic blind spots. Over decades, Tehran invested in missile deterrence-not air defense. And when the attacks began, Iran’s air defense system-an ad-hoc mix of S-300s, Chinese knockoffs, and home-built batteries-was overwhelmed.“Iran never relied on air defenses alone to ward off attacks like this. The idea was always to use deterrence,” said Fabian Hinz of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.But deterrence failed. Iran’s strongest deterrent, Hezbollah, was crippled last year and physically cut off by Israel’s destruction of the Syrian corridor. Israeli strikes on Syrian air-defense systems effectively opened a corridor-a “superhighway”-for Israeli planes to reach Iranian airspace unopposed.Unlike Ukraine, which used early US intelligence in 2022 to scatter and conceal its mobile air defenses, Iran was caught by surprise. Israeli intelligence operatives and drones sabotaged key systems on the ground in the hours before the first wave of strikes. Simultaneously, Mossad assassinated top military leaders in their homes.“What Israel did with Iran is what Russia wanted to do with Ukraine,” Israeli analyst Michael Horowitz told the Journal. “But it turned out that the Ukrainian society has a resilience and cannot be so easily penetrated-whereas when it comes to Iran, the regime is so unpopular that it’s easy to find people there who will agree to work with Israel.”For now, Israeli generals believe time is on their side. Iran’s missile attacks continue, but with one-third of its launchers gone and Israeli jets flying freely, the odds are shifting.“It’s a numbers game, and it seems like Israel has the upper hand,” said retired US Air Force Gen. Timothy Ray. “After all, the best way to shoot a missile is on the ground while it’s in a container, and not in the air while it’s flying.”Ray’s comment reveals the brutal calculus behind air campaigns: preemptive destruction isn’t just tactical-it’s strategic, psychological, and political. With Iran reeling and international pressure mounting, Israel may have redefined modern air warfare.Not since the opening days of the Gulf War has a country so swiftly gained dominance over an adversary’s skies. And as Russia grinds on in the mud of eastern Ukraine, Israel has flown past in the stratosphere-proving that supremacy in the air remains the shortest path to power on the ground.(With inputs from agencies)","Despite chaos, one strategic truth has crystallized: Israel now owns Iran's skies.

Gaza: UN rights chief urges governments to 'wake up'





As Israel targeted Iran’s main nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz amid escalating conflict, head of the UN nuclear watchdog agency said that there is a possibility of both radiological and chemical contamination there. However, he asserted that the radiation levels outside the complex are normal.Expressing concern over whether uranium is inhaled or ingested, International Atomic Energy Agency director-general Rafael Mariano Grossi said that it will pose a significant danger. However, he added that risk can be managed with effective measures.""The level of radioactivity outside the Natanz site has remained unchanged and at normal levels, indicating no external radiological impact to the population or the environment from this event,"" he said.While addressing an urgent session of the IAEA's board in Vienna, he informed that no additional damage had been reported at Natanz and the Isfahan nuclear research site since Saturday.However, he cautioned that uranium particles, particularly in the form of uranium hexafluoride gas used during enrichment, can be highly toxic if inhaled or ingested. The chemical is extremely volatile, corrosive, and can cause severe injuries on contact with skin or lungs.Grossi emphasised the need for appropriate protective measures for those working at the site, including respiratory equipment.Recent satellite images analysed by The Associated Press show extensive destruction at Natanz, including several buildings linked to power supply systems. Grossi confirmed that the above-ground portion of the Natanz complex was destroyed, although the underground centrifuge facility appeared to be intact. He warned, however, that the loss of power may have caused unseen damage to sensitive infrastructure.The Israeli strikes also targeted the nuclear research facility in Isfahan, damaging four critical buildings, including a uranium conversion plant. While no radiation leaks were detected at either site, the scale of the attack has raised global concerns.In contrast, Iran's underground Fordo enrichment facility and the Bushehr nuclear power plant, the country's only commercial reactor, were reportedly unharmed. The Tehran Research Reactor also remained unaffected.The United Nations' top human rights official on Monday issued a scathing rebuke of Israel’s ongoing military operations in Gaza, saying they are causing ""horrifying, unconscionable suffering"" for Palestinians. He called on world leaders to act urgently to halt the violence.""The facts speak for themselves,"" said Volker Türk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, in a strongly worded address opening the latest session of the human rights council in Geneva. ""Everyone in government needs to wake up to what is happening in Gaza. All those with influence must exert maximum pressure on Israel and Hamas, to put an end to this unbearable suffering.""","Israel targeted Iran’s main nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz amid escalating conflict.

At least 34 Palestinians were killed Monday in shootings near food distribution centres in Gaza, the territory's health ministry said. It was the deadliest such incident so far in a series of near-daily shootings around the aid sites.The food centres are operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). Thousands of Palestinians often pass through Israeli military-controlled zones to reach these centres.Witnesses said Israeli troops opened fire early Monday to control crowds at the Rafah centre, one of the busiest aid locations in the south. The Israeli military has not commented on Monday's deaths but previously said its troops fired warning shots at what it calls suspects approaching military positions.Most of the victims were near the GHF centre in Rafah, with a few on roads leading to a newer hub outside Khan Younis, according to officials. Two people trying to get food at the Rafah site told The Associated Press that soldiers fired on the crowd at around 4 am at a nearby traffic circle known as the Flag Roundabout. The area has seen repeated shootings in recent weeks.The military has marked certain routes for people to use to access food, and GHF has warned that straying from them is dangerous.However, many Gazans take the risk in hopes of getting food before supplies run out.Israel and the US say the GHF system helps prevent Hamas from stealing aid, but UN agencies and major aid groups disagree. They say the system is unsafe, cannot meet Gaza's humanitarian needs, and gives Israel too much control over who receives help.Since the centres opened last month, Palestinian officials say dozens have been killed and hundreds injured while trying to access aid. The ongoing war and restrictions on aid delivery have pushed Gaza closer to famine, putting the lives of nearly 2 million people at risk.","It was the deadliest such incident so far in a series of near-daily shootings around the aid sites.

As Israel continues to target nuclear sites in Iran, Tehran on Monday said that its parliamentarians are preparing a bill that will push it towards exiting the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.According to a report by Reuters, Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said, ""In light of recent developments, we will take an appropriate decision. Government has to enforce parliament bills, but such a proposal is just being prepared and we will coordinate in the later stages with parliament.""Meanwhile, he also reiterated Tehran's official stance against developing nuclear weapons.This comes amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran as both countries continue to launch waves of missiles at each other. The timing of this statement is also crucial, as Israel alleged that Iran is on the verge of building a nuclear bomb.However, Iran denied the allegations, asserting that its nuclear programme is peaceful. Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian echoed that position on Monday, saying nuclear arms violate the country’s core religious principles.But last week, the IAEA said that Iran violated its NPT obligations. Baghaei said the recent Israeli attacks and the IAEA resolution played a direct role in Tehran's strategic reassessment.""Those voting for the resolution prepared the ground for the attack,"" he said.The 1970 treaty restricts signatories from pursuing nuclear weapons in exchange for access to civilian nuclear technology and oversight by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).According to Reuters' report, no decision on quitting the NPR has been made yet, but the proposal is in initial stages of legal process.Meanwhile, Baghaei criticised Israel's own nuclear stance, highlighting that the country is not a signatory to the NPT and is widely believed to possess an undeclared nuclear arsenal. ""The Zionist regime is the only possessor of weapons of mass destruction in the region,"" he said.","Iran says its parliamentarians are preparing a bill that will push it towards exiting the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

The Israeli Defence Force (IDF) on Monday claimed to have dismantled ""one-third of Iran's missile launchers"" in last night's attack, as tensions between the Jewish state and Tehran continue to peak over uranium enrichment and the possibility that the Khamenei-led nation may soon develop nuclear weapons.The IDF shared footage of attacks on Iranian sites, saying that they dismantled over 20 surface-to-surface Iranian missiles ""minutes before they were to be launched toward Israel’s home front"".""Approx. 100 military targets were struck in Isfahan, central Iran. Around 50 fighter jets and aircraft identified and struck missile storage sites and surface-to-surface missile launchers that were ready for launch toward Israel,"" the IDF claimed on X.It further wrote: ""With this, we can now say that 1/3rd of the Iranian regime's missile launchers have been dismantled.""Earlier, Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi accused Israel of trying to widen the scope of the ongoing conflict by targeting a key gas facility along the Gulf coast.“Dragging the conflict into the Persian Gulf region is a major strategic mistake, likely deliberate and intended to extend the war beyond Iranian territory,” Araghchi said during a meeting with foreign diplomats.The minister’s remarks came in response to Israel’s strike on a gas installation operating in the South Pars field, located offshore near Iran’s southern Bushehr province. The site is critical, providing nearly 70 per cent of Iran’s domestic natural gas supply.The South Pars/North Dome gas field, shared between Iran and Qatar, is considered the largest known natural gas reserve in the world. Iran has been actively developing its portion of the field since the late 1990s.On Saturday, Iranian media reported a ""massive explosion"" and a subsequent fire after an Israeli drone attack targeted facilities at Phase 14 of the South Pars project.Calling the incident ""an extremely dangerous move,"" Araghchi warned that military escalation in the Gulf ""could involve the entire region -- and possibly the whole world.""The attack on South Pars came shortly after Israel’s large-scale offensive on Friday, which struck nuclear sites, military installations, residential areas, and reportedly killed senior Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists.In retaliation, Iran launched a deadly missile barrage against Israel, killing at least 10 people overnight on Sunday and injuring dozens more.","IDF shared footage of attacks on Iranian sites, saying that they dismantled over 20 surface-to-surface Iranian missiles ""minutes before they were to be launched toward Israel's home front"" Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi accused Israel of trying to widen the scope of the ongoing conflict by targeting a key gas facility along the Gulf coast.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121882968,imgsize-54744,width-400,resizemode-4/121882968.jpg"

Israeli Weapons Censored In Paris As Airstrikes Continue In Gaza And Conflict With Iran Deepens





Israel's Ministry of Defence has condemned the erection of black partition walls around its defence industry pavilions at the Paris Air Show, calling the move ""outrageous and unprecedented"" and demanding an immediate reversal by French authorities and event organisers.The walls appeared overnight ahead of the air show's opening Monday, visually isolating Israeli booths from dozens of other international exhibitors. Israeli officials say the move followed a last-minute demand from organisers to remove offensive weapons systems from display - a request they rejected.""The French are hiding behind supposedly political considerations to exclude Israeli offensive weapons from an international exhibition - weapons that compete with French industries,"" the ministry said in a statement Monday, calling the action ""ugly and improper.""A French appeals court ruled Friday against activist groups who sought to block Israeli companies from participating in the show due to the war in Gaza. Despite the legal green light, Israel says it was effectively censored.Sylvain Pavillet, a lawyer working with the air show organisers, said the final decision on who is allowed to exhibit lies with the French government, not the show itself.""The fair is not the one who decides which countries are allowed to go to the show or not,"" he told The Associated Press. ""That decision belongs to the government. We are not a state. We are a commercial company.""The Paris Air Show, held at Le Bourget Airport, is one of the world's largest and most prestigious events for the aerospace and defence industry.",Israel's Ministry of Defence has condemned the erection of black partition walls around its defence industry pavilions at the Paris Air Show. The walls appeared overnight ahead of the air show's opening Monday. Israeli officials say the move followed a last-minute demand from organisers to remove offensive weapons systems from display - a request they rejected.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121882227,imgsize-773080,width-400,resizemode-4/121882227.jpg"

Iranian forces unleashed barrage of missiles on Israel early Monday, targeting major cities including Tel Aviv and Haifa, marking a dramatic escalation in tensions between the two regional powers.The assault damaged residential areas and raised global concerns about the potential for a wider Middle Eastern conflict Powerful explosions shook Tel Aviv as Israel's defence systems intercepted Iranian missiles. Plumes of black smoke billowed into the sky over the coastal city.Iran's Revolutionary Guards claimed to have employed a novel attack method that allegedly caused Israel's multi-layered defence systems to target each other.""The initiatives and capabilities used in this operation, despite the comprehensive support of the United States and Western powers and the possession of the most up-to-date and newest defence technology, led to the successful and maximum hitting of the missiles on the targets in the occupied territories,"" it said.They warned that future operations would be ""more devastating, tougher, more precise, and more destructive.""""The arrogant dictator of Tehran has become a cowardly murderer who targets the civilian home front in Israel to deter the IDF from continuing the attack that is collapsing his capabilities,"" Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement. ""The residents of Tehran will pay the price, and soon."" Israel's primary defence mechanism, the Iron Dome , along with other air defence systems, intercepted many of the incoming Iranian missiles. Military officials reported an ""80 to 90% success rate"" in intercepting these threats, though they acknowledged that no defence system is completely impenetrable.The Iron Dome is Israel's sophisticated air defence system, primarily designed to intercept and destroy short-range rockets, mortars, and drones. Developed by Rafael Advanced Defence Systems with American support, this defensive shield became operational in 2011 and has proven highly effective, with Israeli military officials reporting an impressive 80-90% success rate.The system employs truck-mounted units that fire radar-guided missiles to neutralise incoming threats in mid-air. One of its notable features is its intelligent threat assessment capability - it can determine whether a rocket is headed toward a populated area and only intercepts those that pose a genuine threat, allowing others to land in unpopulated areas.","Iranian forces unleashed barrage of missiles on Israel early Monday, targeting major cities including Tel Aviv and Haifa.
