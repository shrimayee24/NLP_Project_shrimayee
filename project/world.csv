It provides a viable pathway to long-term and sustainable peace, security and development for the Palestinian and Israeli people, as also for the larger West Asian region,"" said PM Modi in a post on X.PM Modi expressed hope that ""all concerned will come together behind President Trump's initiative and support this effort to end conflict and secure peace.""Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Monday that they have agreed on a plan to end the Gaza war, though it is unclear if Hamas will accept the terms.Also read: Who will govern Gaza? Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan — Explained The GOP leader’s plan on the Israel-Hamas war, which started on October 7, 2023, involves a 20-point peace proposal aimed at ending the conflict and preventing further escalation in the region. The plan calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of hostages, and the protection of civilians on both sides. It also stresses the need for stronger regional cooperation and international monitoring to ensure compliance.Trump has argued that only a detailed, step-by-step framework can restore stability.Hamas has yet to give its judgement on the 20-point plan. The plan calls for a ceasefire, the release of hostages by Hamas within 72 hours, the disarmament of Hamas, and a gradual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, followed by a post-war transitional authority headed by Trump himself.""I support your plan to end the war in Gaza which achieves our war aims,"" Netanyahu said during a joint press conference with US President. ""If Hamas rejects your plan, President, or if they supposedly accept it and then basically do everything to counter it, then Israel will finish the job by itself.""Trump said that Israel would have his ""full backing"" if Hamas did not accept the deal.

India Calls Out Pakistan Twice at UNHRC Over Terror and Kashmir Lies, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bombing

NEW DELHI: In order to smoothen Lashkar-e-Taiba operations and ensure uninterrupted training in a new terrain, the Pakistani military has launched a “clean-up drive” in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province to neutralise Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan TTP ) cadre in Lower Dir district.The clean-up drive, launched in June this year, has not only resulted in the death of over two dozen TTP operatives but also allowed the LeT to start constructing its new terror centre within a month of the operation. The recent aerial attack on an alleged TTP facility in Tirah Valley in KPK on Sept 22 was a part of this drive, an intelligence dossier has disclosed.Though Pakistan was the main patron of the Taliban — a militia of fundamentalists trained in Deobandi madrasas in Pakistan — and helped them fight and beat Russians, Americans as well as local ethnic groups like Tajiks and aided them install themselves in Kabul, the TTP has refused to be as pliant as ISI — Pakistan’s spy agency — expected it to. Its assertion of autonomy can potentially be problematic for ISI’s plans to find a new base for the LeT in KPK, considering that it is the homeground for Taliban.ISI has tried to recruit terrorists from the Lower Dir region for the jihad against India, Al Badr, but LeT and Hizbul Mujahideen had no presence there before Operation Sindoor in May. “Due to sectarian differences — TTP being Deobandi and anti-Pakistan and LeT following the Ahle Hadith ideology and being pro-Pakistan — there have been targeted killings of LeT commanders in Lower Dir by TTP operatives,” according to the dossier.In 2011, the LeT had tried to establish a temporary training centre in Lower Dir, but a suicide bomb attack carried out by TTP at the funeral of an LeT commander had led to the deaths of dozens of LeT members, a source said.Since June, the Pakistani army and air force have killed over 40 civilians in airstrikes, officially claiming these operations aimed at making Khyber Pakhtunkhwa “terror free”. “These operations are in reality focused on removing terrorists hostile to the Pakistani state while simultaneously facilitating the establishment of anti-India terror groups in the region, reflecting Pakistan’s longterm state strategy of endorsing ‘good terrorism’ while eliminating ‘bad terrorism’,” said a source.Lashkar, the sources said, has also been asked by Pakistani spy agency ISI to share training facilities with the Hizbul Mujahideen.“Operationally, the LeT’s new training centre expected to be completed by Dec 2025 poses a long-term threat. While still under construction, it is already emerging as a fresh hub for terrorist training,” the source added.","Pakistan has launched a ‘clean-up drive’ in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province to neutralise Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan TTP ) cadre in Lower Dir district.

Yes No

NEW DELHI: An image of Jesus Christ inside a 'Vatican City-themed' Durga Puja pandal in Ranchi was replaced on Friday with that of Lord Krishna.The development came following objections raised by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). The VHP alleged that the marquee, organised by R R Sporting Club at Ratu Road, was made to ""hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus"" and encourage conversion. The organisers had rejected these charges earlier on Thursday.The club’s patron Vicky Yadav said the decision was taken by the puja committee members and not due to protests by any section, reports news agency PTI. “It was not due to the protest by a certain section but by our committee members to show all religions on the same platform,” he said. He said that European-style statues placed outside the pandal were retained.Yadav claimed that the design aimed to promote peace and brotherhood. ""India stands for religious harmony. If that doesn’t exist, then why not just declare this a Hindu nation?"" he asked, showing videos of Prime Minister Narendra Modi visiting churches abroad during official trips.He said the idea was inspired by India’s multi-faith culture and that the club promotes Sanatan Dharma..""We have been organising Durga Puja for the last 50 years, and every year we make pandals based on certain themes. This year, we decided to replicate the Durga Puja pandal made by Sreebhumi Sporting Club in Kolkata in 2022 on the theme of Vatican City,"" Yadav said.VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal had expressed concern on Thursday on X, saying, ""This has been done with an objective to hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus and aimed at encouraging religious conversion. If the organising committee of this Durga Puja pandal is so interested in secularism, I would ask them to display a photograph of a Hindu God or Goddess at any event organised by the Church or at Madrasas in Ranchi.

Police Lathicharge Protesters After Violence Breaks Out In Bareilly During ‘I Love Muhammad’ March

BAREILLY: At least 38 shops — mainly belonging to the minority community — were sealed by authorities in Bareilly on Monday, days after a clash erupted between police and protesters of the “I Love Muhammad” campaign last Friday. Shop owners alleged that the civic action was a reprisal for the violence.Locals said the shops, selling garments and footwear and located at Novelty Chowk about 200m from Clock Tower, were forcefully vacated by the Bareilly municipal corporation for “encroachment.” Shopkeepers said the units belong to the waqf board DM Avinash Singh said, “The shops have been sealed. If someone has any document regarding it, they can produce it before the municipal commissioner. We have checked and verified all documents before taking the step.”He added, “It was part of a crackdown on those rioters who tried to disrupt the city’s peace and law and order. The shopkeepers had also encroached upon a large drain on government land. The crackdown will continue.”Shopkeeper Mohd Waris countered, “Civic body filed a case for land ownership. However, we have a stay from the court. This action was taken only due to Dr Nafees Ahmed, spokesperson of Ittehad-e-Millat Council, who used to take rent from us. A civic team simply asked shopkeepers to vacate within three hours, without prior notice.”Internet services remained suspended in parts of Bareilly Monday as security forces maintained vigilance.","At least 38 shops, mainly belonging to the minority community, were sealed by authorities in Bareilly on Monday.

"No immunity from Pocso FIR despite marrying survivor, having child: HC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-immunity-from-pocso-fir-despite-marrying-survivor-having-child-hc/articleshow/124220269.cms,"Representative image

NAGPUR: Holding that a minor’s consent for a physical relationship is “irrelevant” under current law, Nagpur bench of Bombay HC has refused to quash a case filed under Pocso Act against a 29-year-old Washim man who married a 17-year-old and fathered her child. HC ruled Friday that the FIR cannot be dismissed merely because the girl married the accused and later became a mother.Dismissing a plea by M A Beigh and two family members to set aside the case, a division bench of Justices Urmila Joshi-Phalke and Nandesh Deshpande said: “Despite knowing the girl was a minor, he commits an offence from the moment he takes her away from the legal custody of her parents. Merely because the girl has given birth to a child, the criminal act cannot be brushed aside.”Beigh married the girl on June 2, 2024, when she was 17. She gave birth to a baby boy in May. Cops registered the case after learning of the childbirth and the mother’s age.Now an adult, the survivor supported the accused in court, stating their relationship was consensual and the marriage was approved by both families. Her lawyer urged the court to treat it as an “exceptional case,” arguing prosecution would harm both mother and child.HC, however, saidthe accused “ought to have waited till the girl attained 18 years of age,” adding that taking a minor from her parents’ lawful custody is an offence regardless of affection or marriage.The judges noted SC is examining whether consensual adolescent relationships deserve different treatment under the Pocso Act, but said that until Parliament amends the law, courts must follow it. It also cited govt’s opposition to lowering age of consent, warning it would “reintroduce the very mischief the law was enacted to prevent”."," Bombay HC refuses to quash a case filed under Pocso Act against a 29-year-old Washim man.

Pak PM SHAMED For ‘Desperate’ Pitch To Trump After India’s ‘Terror’ Insult; ‘Made To Wait...’

Why it matters



Religious optics: Patel’s past positions on Hindu identity amplify the symbolism. He has publicly defended the Ram Temple as a 500-year civilisational struggle. Munir, meanwhile, has repeatedly championed the Two-Nation Theory, framing Hindus and Muslims as fundamentally different. For critics, their handshake was a clash of incompatible worldviews.

Trump has courted Islamabad with new trade incentives, cooperation in oil exploration, and diplomatic photo-ops. For Delhi, it signals a pivot away from India at a delicate moment. Nobel frustration: Trump has reportedly bristled that India has not nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize, a personal slight that has seeped into diplomatic irritation. Ironically, New Delhi is one of the only establishments who have openly defied Trump even as allies have bent over to fete him.

Ceasefire claims — and India’s rebuttals:



The big picture



Trump’s Hindu outreach: From Diwali speeches to opposing California’s caste bill, Trump had aggressively wooed Hindu-Americans before the 2024 US Presidential Elections. Patel, with his religious identity and pro-Modi rhetoric, is an important part of that effort.

He wrote the Nunes memo, became Trump’s Russiagate warrior, and cultivated a brand of being loud, unapologetic, and Hindu. He is Trump’s dharma warrior in Washington, embodying both sanskar and swagger.

Defenders insist Patel was only following diplomatic protocol. But when India–Pakistan relations are this combustible, and Trump has already alienated Delhi, even a handshake cannot escape political weight. Diaspora politics: Patel embodies the tension of being both an American official and a Hindu son of Gujarat. That double burden makes every act — even a courtesy greeting — a test of loyalty in the eyes of the diaspora.

Bottom line







When Kash Patel came to his Congressional confirmation as FBI chief, he chanted Jai Shree Krishna, touched his parents’ feet, and swore on the Bhagavad Gita — the perfect amalgamation of diaspora sanskar and MAGA defiance. The man who broke every stereotype about Indian-Americans is now at the centre of a storm: a single photo of him shaking hands with Pakistan’s Army Chief Asim Munir has ignited outrage across India and its diaspora.President Donald Trump hosted Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House last week. Among the senior American officials present was FBI Director Kash Patel. While Trump’s hospitality for Pakistan’s leadership was expected, the image of Patel — Indian-origin, Hindu, and a vocal defender of the Ram Mandir — warmly greeting Munir struck a raw nerve. The photo went viral, spawning accusations of betrayal, opportunism, and hypocrisy.The reactions reflected a sharp divide. Some critics called Patel’s gesture with Munir a disgrace for the Hindus across the world, given Munir's utterances about Indians and Hindus.Others took a more pragmatic view, noting that as FBI Director “he could hardly decline such a greeting in his official capacity.” Still others pushed back against the controversy itself, asking why every episode was filtered through religion: “Munir is a Pakistani, Patel is an American — both will inevitably prioritise national interests over faith. ”Patel’s handshake cannot be separated from the broader drift in Trump-era India–US ties:In May 2025, Trump claimed he “brokered” a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. Delhi said it was negotiated directly by the two militaries. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh called Trump’s assertion that India stopped operations “under pressure” baseless. The Ministry of External Affairs issued a six-point rebuttal, stressing that no US leverage or trade carrots influenced its decision. At the UN in September 2025, India declared “no room for any third party” in its disputes, directly rejecting Trump’s boast of mediation. Even Pakistan acknowledged that India flatly rejected third-party involvement during Operation Sindoor. Despite this, Trump continues to credit himself for “calling off” India’s military actions — a narrative Delhi has consistently dismissed.Kash Patel is no ordinary bureaucrat. He is the Hindu face of Trump’s MAGA world, the chief of the FBI, the man who chanted Jai Shree Krishna in Congress, and the rare Indian-American to turn faith into political muscle. That is why his handshake with Asim Munir is not being judged as protocol but as a betrayal of history, faith, and India’s strained relationship with Trump’s America. Of course it's important to remember that loyalties come in different forms, and Patel's is too Donald Trump before anything else.","The gesture came just months after the Pahalgam terror attack.

First-cousin marriage: UK NHS cites benefits; conservatives slam report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/first-cousin-marriage-uk-nhs-cites-benefits-conservatives-slam-report/articleshow/124213696.cms,".





UK’s National Health Service (NHS) is facing criticism for linking first-cousin marriages to “stronger extended family support” and economic benefits.Experts warn that marrying a first cousin carries health risks, including a higher chance of children inheriting recessive genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis or thalassaemia, reported The Standard.The controversy comes after NHS staff in Bradford described marrying a cousin as a “cultural practice”.The guidance, released by NHS England’s genomics education programme, although noting that first-cousin marriages, common in the British Pakistani community, are linked to a greater risk of genetic conditions in children, it recommended public health measures such as awareness campaigns rather than banning cousin marriages, saying that outlawing the practice could stigmatise communities.The document received severe backlash from the conservatives of the UK, including Tory MP Richard Holden, who said that the NHS should act against “damaging and oppressive cultural practices” and call for an end to cousin marriage, reported The Daily Mail.“The Conservatives want to see an end to cousin marriage as a backdoor to immigration too, but Labour are deaf to these sensible demands. Sir Keir Starmer should stop running scared of the misogynistic community controllers and their quislings who appear in the form of cultural relativist-obsessed sociology professors, and ban a practice the overwhelming majority, from every community in Britain, want to see ended for good,” he said.Holden has also proposed a bill to ban first-cousin marriages, though Downing Street has said the government has no plans to take this step.Aneeta Prem MBE, founder of the Freedom Charity, also criticised the guidance, saying cousin marriages are a safeguarding risk.

Kirk Killing: Candace Owens Accuses FBI Of Faking Evidence; Says Tyler Robinson’s Texts are Fabricated

Poll Should conspiracy theories surrounding high-profile cases be taken seriously? Yes, they can reveal hidden truths. No, they spread misinformation.

Candace's earlier theory of Israel, Bill Ackman







Candace Owens has come up with a new conspiracy theory claiming that she now has sources confirming that Tyler Robinson was framed and he was not the person who shot and killed conservative leader Charlie Kirk.Candace said everything the Feds said about the case so far and about how Tyler Robinson was caught is a lie, including that Tyler Robinson is suicidal.“I want to break this news immediately because it feels important and I think if I don’t break it immediately, something bad might happen,"" Candace said teasing a big reveal on Monday giving a weekend cliffhanger for her viewers.“Tyler Robinson is not suicidal. The entire narrative that was placed in the media about him having been suicidal is completely fictional, as are many other aspects of what we have been told… His father having “turned him in after a confession” is also complete fiction. To the contrary, Tyler Robinson maintains his innocence and has never even been to the UVU campus,” she said.“Which is why they have produced nothing other than a blurry image which Tyler’s family knows is not him,” she continued. “…The federal government is lying about absolutely everything except for the fact that it is her gun…”Candace earlier claimed that Kirk was pressured to visit Israel by hedge fund manager Bill Ackman.Candace said Ackman threatened Kirk during a high-stakes ""intervention"" in the Hamptons, weeks before the murder.Ackman called Candace out for defaming him. “For the record, at no time have I ever threatened Charlie Kirk, Turning Point or anyone associated with him,” Ackman said. “I have never blackmailed anyone, let alone Charlie Kirk. I have never offered Charlie or Turning Point any money in an attempt to influence Charlie's opinion on anything. In fact, my interactions with Charlie Kirk have been extremely cordial, albeit limited, regretfully so, as I was very impressed by him and his work and I will sadly never see him again. ”","Candace said everything the Feds said about the case so far and about how Tyler Robinson was caught is a lie, including that Tyler Robinson is suicidal. “The federal government is lying about absolutely everything except for the fact that it is her gun,” she said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124185320,imgsize-1649852,width-400,resizemode-4/candance-owens-claimed-tyler-robinson-did-not-kill-charlie-kirk-and-everything-told-about-robinson-and-his-arrest-is-a-lie.jpg"

America 360: Ex-Marine Kills Four In Michigan Church Shooting, Sets Church on Fire

Motive not established, mother's eerie post surfaces



White House says Sanford hated people of the Mormon faith



A Trump supporter; message for Charlie Kirk







40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford rammed a Michigan Church with his vehicle, got out and opened fire with an assault rifle, killing at least four people in the latest mass violence in the country. Officers killed Sanford in the parking lot behind the church.Sanford was not just a crazed gunman as he had a long history of serving in the US Army -- he joined the Marine Corps in 2004 and held the titles of organizational automotive mechanic and vehicle recovery operator. In 2007, he started a nearly seven-month deployment under Operation Iraqi Freedom.Thomas Sanford’s mom, Brenda Walters-Sanford, posted the eerie message on Facebook before Sunday’s carnage at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints church in Grand Blanc Township, according to screenshots circulating online.“Talking to someone who constantly avoids accountability is not a real conversation – it’s a battle. It’s a cycle of deflection, projection, twisting, and playing the victim,” the post on her since-deleted account said. “When I try to express how your actions have hurt me, you don’t listen with the intention of understanding; you listen with the intention of defending yourself. That’s not communication — that’s self-preservation of your ego.“I don’t owe my peace to someone who only wants to win an argument, not to understand my heart. My energy is not a prize for someone committed to misunderstanding me. At some point, you have to value yourself enough to stop begging someone to hear you,” the post read.The context of the post is not clear.While the motive of the attack is not clear, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday indicated the gunman “hated people of the Mormon faith.” “From what I understand based on my conversations with the FBI director, all they know right now is this was an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith,” Leavitt told Fox News’ “Fox & Friends” on Monday morning.“They are trying to understand more about this: How premeditated it was, how much planning went into it, whether he left a note.”Sanford was a Trump supporter as he was seen wearing a Trump 2020 shirt in an old photo. His mother was also a red supporter and shared a social media post on Charlie Kirk's birthday on October 14. The post urged everyone to wear Red on Kirk's birthday.","Thomas Jacob Sanford rammed a Michigan Church with his vehicle, got out and opened fire with an assault rifle, killing at least four people.

Pothole pangs: Bengaluru college student run over by truck; residents flag bad roads,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bengaluru-college-student-run-over-by-truck-residents-flag-bad-roads/articleshow/124218837.cms,"



BENGALURU: Yet another death on city roads, and yet again the issue of potholes is front and centre.A 20-year-old student died on her way to college, after she was run over by a speeding truck near Budigere Cross on Monday.Dhanushree, the victim, a resident of Virgonagar, was a second-year BCom student at a private college in KR Pura.Though police are yet to determine whether potholes had a role in the accident, according to one resident of Bhuvaneshwari Layout, where the victim used to stay, Dhanushree was flung off her two-wheeler while negotiating a pothole, when she was run over by a speeding concrete-mixer vehicle.Police said Dhanushree, survived by her mother and two sisters, was riding a scooter around 8.30 am, when a speeding truck hit her from behind, just a few metres away from Bhuvaneshwari Enclave. As Dhanushree was flung right in the middle of the road, she came under the wheels of the truck that ran over her head.Following the accident, the truck driver fled the spot.Some passersby, who saw Dhanushree's lifeless body lying in a pool of blood, alerted the police, who rushed to the spot and moved the body to the mortuary.A senior police officer later said: ""We were unable to trace the eyewitnesses, so we don't know exactly which truck was involved in the accident.We are still analysing CCTV footage of the surrounding areas for further clues.""The body was handed over to the family after post-mortem.Based on a complaint filed by Dhanushree's mother, a single parent, a case has been registered against the truck driver under BNS Section 106 (causing death due to negligence).Cops claimed the victim's mother did not blame the civic authorities in her complaint. ""During a spot visit, we found the road in good condition in the direction in which Dhanushree was headed. However, the lane in the opposite direction was in a very bad shape. We are trying to verify if she was negotiating a pothole when the accident happened,"" a police officer said.Some of the residents who had gathered at the spot blamed the road condition for the accident.Bhuvaneshwari Enclave Welfare Association president Murali A said: ""Dhanushree was my neighbour. She was a very bright student. The road has been in very bad condition for many years now. It got worse last year. Moreover, there are no streetlights on that stretch.""The Mahadevapura Task Force, a volunteer group, blamed lack of funding for PWD to fill up potholes.Condoling the incident, Manjula Limbavali, the Mahadevapura MLA, said she would discuss the issue with the state govt. She claimed the govt was issuing funds for road repair only within GBA limits.For the record, Mahadevapura has GBA as well as RDPR and PWD roads.","Dhanushree, 20, was a second-year BCom student at a private college in KR Pura.

BAREILLY: At least 38 shops -- mainly belonging to the minority community -- at a large market complex in Bareilly city were ""sealed"" by local authorities on Monday, days after a clash erupted between protesters of the ‘I love Muhammad' campaign and police last week on Friday.

They belong to the waqf board, alleged shopkeepers.Speaking about the issue, Bareilly district magistrate (DM) Avinash Singh said, ""The shops have been sealed.

We have checked and verified all the documents before taking this step.""The DM added: ""It was part of a crackdown on those rioters who tried to disrupt the city's peace and law and order.

Israeli military transfers data as Microsoft cuts access





Microsoft has cut off cloud computing and AI services to an Israeli military intelligence unit after an investigation revealed the technology was being used for mass surveillance of Palestinian civilians. The tech giant made the decision following a Guardian investigation that exposed how Israel's Unit 8200 stored millions of intercepted Palestinian phone calls on Microsoft's Azure platform.Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and vice chair, announced the termination in an internal memo to employees, stating the company found ""evidence that supports elements of The Guardian's reporting."" The blocked services include cloud storage and AI technologies that Unit 8200 had used to collect and analyze up to ""a million calls an hour"" from Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.An Israeli security official downplayed the impact, telling CNN there is ""no damage to the operational capabilities of the IDF."" Neither the Israel Defense Forces nor the Ministry of Defense responded to requests for comment about the service termination.The No Azure for Apartheid group, which includes of Microsoft employees, had been pressured Microsoft for over a year through protests and demonstrations, called the decision a significant win.""Today's news is a significant and unprecedented win for the campaign and our organizing,"" said Hossam Nasr, an organizer with the group, noting Microsoft became ""the first US tech company to stop the sale of some technologies to the Israeli military since the start of the genocide in Gaza. ""However, the activist group said the action doesn't go far enough, as Microsoft only disabled services to a single unit while ""the vast majority of Microsoft's contract with the Israeli military remains intact."" The group vowed to continue organizing until all their demands are met.The company said it applies its anti-surveillance principles globally and has maintained this stance for over two decades, with Smith noting that customer privacy commitments prevented Microsoft from accessing the surveillance data directly during its investigation.Intelligence sources told the Guardian that Unit 8200 quickly moved the massive data trove out of Microsoft's Dutch servers within days of the original investigation's publication in August. The unit reportedly plans to transfer the surveillance data to Amazon Web Services, though Amazon has not responded to requests for comment.Smith emphasized that Microsoft ""does not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians"" and noted the decision doesn't affect the company's broader relationship with Israel, including cybersecurity work.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has once again made an urgent appeal to Washington, arguing that allowing American technology companies to compete openly in China serves the best interests of both the countries. On the tech podcast BG2, a podcast hosted by tech investors Brad Gerstner and Bill Gurley, Huang emphasized that a competitive presence in China would enable the US to ""proliferate the technology around the world"" and ""maximise America’s economic success and geopolitical influence.""Huang also expressed hope that China would remain open to outside investment, noting Beijing's pledges to maintain an ""open market."" ""What’s in the best interest of China is for foreign companies to invest in China, compete in China and for them to also have vibrant competition themselves,"" he said.Huang highlighted the rapid advances and robust potential of China's chipmaking industry, cautioning that the country is ""nanoseconds behind"" the US.

Massive Embarrassment For Trump, Netanyahu Rejects 21-Point Gaza Ceasefire Plan On US TV | Watch

Key details of plan include:

Troop withdrawal



Hamas’ future and Gaza’s administration



On Palestinian Authority and statehood



Here is the full 20-point peace plan, as released by the White House:





After days of speculation, the White House on Monday released a 20-point plan aimed at ending the nearly two-year war in Gaza, securing the release of hostages held by Hamas, and setting out the future administration of the Palestinian territory.The proposal calls for an immediate end to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, while leaving Hamas out of any future role in governing Gaza.If both sides agree to the conditions, fighting would stop and all Israeli hostages, dead or alive, would be released ""within 72 hours"" of Israel’s public acceptance of the deal.In exchange for the hostages, Israel would release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences and 1,700 Palestinians detained in Gaza since the war began on October 7, 2023, after Hamas’ attack on Israel. For every Israeli hostage whose remains are handed over, Israel would return the remains of 15 Palestinians.At a press conference after talks at the White House, US President Donald Trump said the plan marked ""a historic day for peace.""He added that Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would have Washington’s support to ""finish the job of destroying the threat of Hamas"" if the militant group rejected the plan.Netanyahu said Israel ""will finish the job"" if Hamas refuses the proposal or does not follow through.The plan presents Hamas with a choice: surrender and give up its arms in return for the end of fighting, humanitarian assistance, and the promise of reconstruction, or reject the deal and face continued military pressure with backing from the US.Under the proposal, Hamas would have to disarm in exchange for a halt to the war, delivery of humanitarian aid, and reconstruction for Gaza’s residents.The plan also refers to the possibility of Palestinian statehood at some stage, but only as a long-term goal. For now, Gaza, home to more than 2 million people, would come under international control. An international security force would take over responsibility for security, while a ""Board of Peace"" led by Trump and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair would oversee administration and reconstruction. Israeli forces would remain positioned around the territory.Trump and Netanyahu confirmed they agreed on the plan after their White House meeting.One part of the plan directly conflicts with Netanyahu’s stated positions. It says the Palestinian Authority would eventually govern Gaza. Netanyahu and his government oppose Palestinian statehood and are unlikely to accept such an arrangement, but the provision remains part of the document.Israel would withdraw its forces from Gaza, but only after Hamas disarms and an international security force moves in to take control of areas vacated by Israeli troops.The plan does not require a full Israeli withdrawal ahead of the release of the hostages. Rather, Israeli forces would withdraw to an agreed upon line, inside Gaza, to prepare for a hostage release.Israel would keep a “security perimeter presence,” a vague term that could amount to maintaining a buffer zone inside Gaza.The plan states Hamas will play no role in governing Gaza. Its tunnels and other military infrastructure would be dismantled. Members pledging to live peacefully would receive amnesty, and those who wish to leave Gaza would be allowed to do so.An international security force would enforce Hamas’ disarmament, maintain order, and train Palestinian police to take over law enforcement. Egypt has said it is preparing thousands of Palestinian police for deployment in Gaza.Humanitarian aid would be delivered in large amounts and managed by “neutral international bodies,” including the UN and the Red Crescent. It is unclear if the Gaza Humanitarian Fund, a food distribution system backed by Israel and the US, would continue.The proposal makes clear Palestinians will not be expelled from Gaza. Instead, there will be an international effort to rebuild the territory for its residents.Such language has become significant as both Trump and Israeli officials have previously spoken of moving Gaza’s population elsewhere and redeveloping the area under international projects.Day-to-day governance would be managed by a group of Palestinian technocrats. The ""Board of Peace,"" led by Trump and Blair, would oversee reconstruction and control funding, giving it substantial influence over Gaza’s administration since rebuilding is the territory’s most urgent need after Israel’s campaign.Under the interim arrangement, the Palestinian Authority would be restructured so it could later assume responsibility for governing Gaza.The plan makes only limited reference to Palestinian statehood. It states that if the Authority carries out the required reforms and reconstruction in Gaza moves forward, ""the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.""1. Gaza will be a deradicalized terror-free zone that does not pose a threat to its neighbours.2. Gaza will be redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza, who have suffered more than enough.3. If both sides agree to this proposal, the war will immediately end. Israeli forces will withdraw to the agreed upon line to prepare for a hostage release. During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal.4. Within 72 hours of Israel publicly accepting this agreement, all hostages, alive and deceased, will be returned.5. Once all hostages are released, Israel will release 250 life sentence prisoners plus 1,700 Gazans who were detained after October 7th 2023, including all women and children detained in that context. For every Israeli hostage whose remains are released, Israel will release the remains of 15 deceased Gazans.6. Once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries.7. Upon acceptance of this agreement, full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip. At a minimum, aid quantities will be consistent with what was included in the January 19, 2025, agreement regarding humanitarian aid, including rehabilitation of infrastructure (water, electricity, sewage), rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries, and entry of necessary equipment to remove rubble and open roads.8. Entry of distribution and aid in the Gaza Strip will proceed without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner with either party. Opening the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism implemented under the January 19, 2025 agreement.9. Gaza will be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza. This committee will be made up of qualified Palestinians and international experts, with oversight and supervision by a new international transitional body, the “Board of Peace,” which will be headed and chaired by President Donald J. Trump, with other members and heads of State to be announced, including Former Prime Minister Tony Blair. This body will set the framework and handle the funding for the redevelopment of Gaza until such time as the Palestinian Authority has completed its reform program, as outlined in various proposals, including President Trump’s peace plan in 2020 and the Saudi-French proposal, and can securely and effectively take back control of Gaza. This body will call on best international standards to create modern and efficient governance that serves the people of Gaza and is conducive to attracting investment.10. A Trump economic development plan to rebuild and energize Gaza will be created by convening a panel of experts who have helped birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities in the Middle East. Many thoughtful investment proposals and exciting development ideas have been crafted by well-meaning international groups, and will be considered to synthesize the security and governance frameworks to attract and facilitate these investments that will create jobs, opportunity, and hope for future Gaza.11. A special economic zone will be established with preferred tariff and access rates to be negotiated with participating countries.12. No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return. We will encourage people to stay and offer them the opportunity to build a better Gaza.13. Hamas and other factions agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form. All military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt. There will be a process of demilitarization of Gaza under the supervision of independent monitors, which will include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning, and supported by an internationally funded buy back and reintegration program all verified by the independent monitors. New Gaza will be fully committed to building a prosperous economy and to peaceful coexistence with their neighbors.14. A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people.15. The United States will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) to immediately deploy in Gaza. The ISF will train and provide support to vetted Palestinian police forces in Gaza, and will consult with Jordan and Egypt who have extensive experience in this field. This force will be the long-term internal security solution. The ISF will work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas, along with newly trained Palestinian police forces. It is critical to prevent munitions from entering Gaza and to facilitate the rapid and secure flow of goods to rebuild and revitalize Gaza. A deconfliction mechanism will be agreed upon by the parties.16. Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza. As the ISF establishes control and stability, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will withdraw based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization that will be agreed upon between the IDF, ISF, the guarantors, and the Unites States, with the objective of a secure Gaza that no longer poses a threat to Israel, Egypt, or its citizens. Practically, the IDF will progressively hand over the Gaza territory it occupies to the ISF according to an agreement they will make with the transitional authority until they are withdrawn completely from Gaza, save for a security perimeter presence that will remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat.17. In the event Hamas delays or rejects this proposal, the above, including the scaled-up aid operation, will proceed in the terror-free areas handed over from the IDF to the ISF.18. An interfaith dialogue process will be established based on the values of tolerance and peaceful co-existence to try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis by emphasizing the benefits that can be derived from peace.19. While Gaza re-development advances and when the PA reform program is faithfully carried out, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.20. The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous co-existence.","The White House released a 20-point plan aimed at ending the nearly two-year war in Gaza. The proposal calls for an immediate end to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, while leaving Hamas out of any future role in governing Gaza. All Israeli hostages, dead or alive, would be released ""within 72 hours"" of Israel’s public acceptance of the deal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124225028,imgsize-1100807,width-400,resizemode-4/lkj-30.jpg"
Indonesia: 65 students trapped as school building collapses; 1 dead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/indonesia-65-students-trapped-as-school-building-collapses-1-dead/articleshow/124224122.cms,"



At least one student was killed, dozens were injured, and 65 were feared buried in the debris after Al Khoziny Islamic boarding school building collapsed in Indonesia.Rescue workers, police, and soldiers, who had been digging through the night, pulled out eight weak and injured students more than eight hours after the collapse in Sidoarjo, East Java. Additional bodies were spotted, suggesting the death toll could rise, AP reported.Families of the students gathered at hospitals and near the collapsed building, anxiously awaiting news of their children. Relatives wailed as they watched rescuers pull a dusty, injured student from the buried prayer hall.A notice board at the command post established in the boarding school complex listed 65 students as missing as of Tuesday morning. They were mostly boys in Class 7 to Class 11, aged between twelve and seventeen.“Oh my God... my son is still buried, oh my God please help!” a mother cried hysterically upon seeing her child's name on the board, followed by the cries of other parents facing similar losses.“Please, sir, please find my child immediately,” pleaded a father, holding the hand of one of the rescue team members. Heavy slabs of concrete, rubble, and unstable parts of the building hampered search and rescue efforts, said Nanang Sigit, a search and rescue officer leading the operation.Heavy equipment was available but not being used due to concerns it could cause further collapse. “We have been running oxygen and water to those still trapped under the debris and keeping them alive while we work hard to get them out,” Sigit said.He added that rescuers had seen several bodies under the rubble but were focused on saving those still alive. Several hundred rescuers participated in the effort, equipped with breathing apparatus, extrication tools, medical evacuation equipment, and other support devices.The students had been performing afternoon prayers in a building undergoing an unauthorised expansion when it suddenly collapsed on top of them, provincial police spokesperson Jules Abraham Abast said. Residents, teachers, and administrators assisted injured students, many with head injuries and broken bones.Female students were praying in another part of the building and managed to escape, survivors said. One male student, a thirteen-year-old boy, was killed, and ninety-nine other students were injured and taken to hospitals, some in critical condition, officials said. Authorities were investigating the cause of the collapse. Abast said the old prayer hall was two stories, but two additional floors were being added without a permit.“The old building's foundation was apparently unable to support two floors of concrete and collapsed during the pouring process,” Abast said.","Rescue workers, police, and soldiers pulled out eight weak and injured students more than eight hours after the collapse in Sidoarjo, East Java.

"US government shutdown to hit hard! Firing allowed, hiring frozen",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-government-shutdown-to-hit-hard-firing-allowed-hiring-frozen-trump-admin-reveals-plans/articleshow/124223811.cms,"Several departments have outlined what services would pause:

A memo from the office of personnel management (OPM) said that training or onboarding new staff will not be permitted under shutdown law, but officials overseeing dismissals will continue their work. Furloughed employees will also, for the first time, be allowed to log into their government computers to check emails for redundancy notices.



will also, for the first time, be allowed to log into their government computers to check emails for redundancy notices. The department of health and human services (HHS) is preparing to furlough 41% of its employees. HHS said new patients will not be admitted into clinical research studies, and health communications with the public will be limited.



The department of labor said the release of economic data, including September’s key jobs report, would be suspended.



The bureau of economic analysis also confirmed that it would stop publishing GDP statistics.



The Veterans Affairs department said that medical care and benefits will continue but maintenance of cemeteries will stop.



The Internal Revenue Service, meanwhile, will keep operating at full strength, thanks to extra money from Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, funding that Republicans have long criticised.







As the potential shutdown looms over the US government, President Donald Trump’s administration on Monday outlined which services would be put on hold.This shutdown, if it takes place, will be unlike the previous ones. The White House has indicated it could use the crisis to carry out mass layoffs and scale back the size of government.Senator Gary Peters of Michigan, the top Democrat on the Senate committee that monitors shutdowns, accused the administration of putting the country at risk. “This outrageous plan threatens to cause lasting damage to the country and the safety of the American people by mass firing nonpartisan, expert civil servants and potentially even eliminating government agencies,” he wrote to the administration, in a letter cited by Reuters.Republicans control both chambers of Congress, but talks with Democrats on a short-term funding plan have stalled. The risk of a federal government shutdown deepened on Monday after Donald Trump’s meeting with congressional leaders ended without a breakthrough. Funding will run out at 12:01 AM on Wednesday unless a deal is struck.Under a 19th-century law, agencies without approved funding must cease operations, with exceptions for national security and for protecting life and property, according to Reuters.Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits are not affected, and student loans and Pell grants will also continue.Unlike in previous years where shutdowns plans were shared weeks in advance, many agencies have only released their shutdown contingency plans in the past day.The new documents reveal the effect of Trump’s staffing reductions: HHS has 12,000 fewer employees than it did a year ago, while the Education Department has 1,700 fewer staff than in 2024.","Department of labor said release of economic data, including September's key jobs report, would be suspended.

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who was temporarily removed from duty following a widely shared video showing him pushing a woman to the ground outside a New York immigration court has been returned to work, two US officials cited by CBS News claimed.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the reinstatement has not been publicly announced.The incident gained national attention last week after videos captured the officer confronting a visibly upset Ecuadoran woman at the 26 Federal Plaza building in Manhattan, which houses the immigration court.Footage shows the woman and her young daughter trying to cling to her husband as federal officers attempted to take him into custody.At one point, the officer, identified only as part of the ICE enforcement team, is seen pushing the woman to the floor while telling her ""adios"" several times.As per CBS News, Ruben Abelardo Ortiz-Lopez, the woman’s husband, was in the US unlawfully and entered the country in March 2024. ICE also said he had previous arrests, including for assault and obstruction of breathing.The woman involved is also facing deportation proceedings.The officer’s reinstatement comes just days after the department of homeland security condemned the conduct, calling it “unacceptable and beneath the men and women of ICE” and stating that he was being relieved of duties pending a full investigation, as per The Guardian.A DHS spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, had emphasised that ICE officers are “held to the highest professional standards”, as per NPR.The case has also drawn political scrutiny. New York Rep Dan Goldman and City Comptroller Brad Lander urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to consider felony charges against the officer, citing “excessive physical force” and violations of the woman’s rights under the Constitution.Goldman called the incident an example of federal officers using “excessive violence… with impunity”.This is not the officer’s first controversial encounter. According to NPR, in September, he was allegedly observed forcibly removing a teenage girl from her father’s arms at the same court, raising concerns among court observers over repeated aggressive behaviour.","Officer who pushed woman at immigration court reinstated to work, US officials claim.

FBI Probes Dark Motive Behind Michigan Church Massacre, Leavitt Hints at Anti-Mormon Hate





Investigators in Michigan are intensively examining the life and actions of a man who killed four people and injured eight others in a church attack over the weekend, as officials work to determine his motive behind the attack and know what drove him to commit the violence.Authorities continue to classify the incident as an ""act of targeted violence,"" with the motive remaining unclear, according to Reuben Coleman, acting special agent in charge of the FBI’s Detroit field office, according to the New York Times.The suspect, identified as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford of Burton, Michigan, was killed in a gunfight with police shortly after the rampage. Sanford, a Marine Corps veteran who served from 2004 to 2008 and achieved the rank of sergeant, had attended high school locally.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was quoted as saying by Fox News that the FBI is exploring whether Sanford harboured religious animosity.“All they know right now is this was an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith, and they are trying to understand more about this, how premeditated it was, how much planning went into it, whether he left a note”, she said.Authorities are also examining Sanford’s property, mobile phone records and speaking with his family, who have cooperated with investigators.The attack occurred Sunday morning at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints meetinghouse in Grand Blanc Township, a community of about 8,000 near Flint.Sanford drove a pickup truck into the building, brandishing two American flags, opened fire on worshippers, and set the church ablaze. Two victims were killed by gunfire, and two more were found later in the charred remains of the building.Eight others, ranging in age from 6 to 78, were hospitalised for gunshot wounds or smoke inhalation, as per Reuters.Grand Blanc Police Chief William Renye confirmed that all worshippers had been accounted for and said authorities are still investigating how the fire began, noting Sanford had likely used an accelerant such as petrol, reported BBC.Officials have interviewed more than 100 people connected to the incident as part of the probe.A separate account from a local Burton City Council candidate, Kris Johns, said Sanford had described members of the church as ""the antichrist"" during a conversation a week before the attack.Google Maps images show a Trump campaign sign at Sanford’s residence, though officials have not linked this to his actions.The Michigan shooting marks the 324th mass shooting in the US in 2025, according to the Gun Violence Archive. It comes a month after a shooting at a Catholic church in Minneapolis and coincidentally involved another 40-year-old Iraq War Marine veteran in a separate North Carolina shooting.Officials, including Governor Gretchen Whitmer, are urging the public to avoid speculation. “While it might feel natural to want to know why this attack happened, speculating is unhelpful and it can be downright dangerous,” she said, as cited by BBC.The FBI has deployed crisis response teams, bomb technicians, and more than 100 agents to assist in the ongoing investigation.Church representatives emphasised the sanctity of places of worship and called for healing. “We pray for peace and healing for all involved,” said Doug Andersen, a spokesman for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.","Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, killed in gunfight with police after shooting at Michigan church.

Ian Andre Roberts, the superintendent of the Des Moines Public Schools in Iowa, who was arrested by ICE, is a registered active Democrat voter in the state of Maryland.According to the official website for the Maryland State Board of Elections, Roberts, who overstayed a student visa from 1999, held an active voter status and was registered as a Democrat in Maryland, Fox News reported.The development was first reported by columnist Dustin Grage. Republican state Delegate Matt Morgan, chair of the Maryland House Freedom Caucus, told Fox News Digital that Roberts’ registration meant he was eligible to vote in all federal, state and local elections despite not being a U.S. citizen and likely not having lived in Maryland for the past decade.Morgan explained that there was nothing in Maryland law allowing non-citizens to be registered to vote in federal or state elections, even if Roberts were still a legal resident.The House Freedom Caucus is now demanding answers from the Maryland State Board of Elections about ""gaping holes"" in the state’s election integrity systems.In a letter sent to the elections board on Monday, the Freedom Caucus also demanded answers on why the board had been ""obstructing a valid request by the Department of Justice to ensure compliance with federal election laws,"" citing immigration enforcement as a primary concern.Morgan referred to a letter the elections board sent to the Justice Department in August in which State Administrator of Elections Jared DeMarinis expressed concern that if the board provided voter information to the federal government, the data would be ""used for enforcement of immigration laws against Maryland residents.""Commenting on the letter, Morgan asked, ""If illegal aliens are not allowed to vote, why would they be on the voter rolls in the first place? And how would that enhance immigration enforcement? I don't know, but that's the excuse that they wrote to the DOJ."" ""It's ridiculous,"" he continued, adding that ""everyone reasonable wants a safe and secure election.""Before his arrest by ICE, Roberts headed the Des Moines Public Schools, the largest school district in the state, despite not being legally authorised to work in the U.S. after his employment authorisation card expired in 2020, according to authorities.He was taken into custody on a fugitive warrant last week. ICE agents arrested Roberts after he attempted to flee and was found hiding in brush. The vehicle Roberts was driving was found with $3,000 in cash, a fixed-blade hunting knife, and a loaded Glock 19 firearm, ICE said.Roberts also had illegal weapons possession charges from 2020 and was given a final order of removal in 2024. The state of Iowa revoked Roberts' education licence on Sunday, triggering the Des Moines School Board to place him on unpaid leave.""We were notified that the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners revoked Doctor Roberts' licence to practise as a superintendent in the state of Iowa. Without such a licence, Doctor Roberts is not in compliance with his contract,"" said Jackie Norris, chair of the school board.Morgan said that although Roberts’ case was baffling, he feared Roberts might just be the tip of the iceberg regarding illegal aliens registered to vote in Maryland. ""We have no idea how widespread this is. We hear rumours, but we have no idea,"" he said. ""This is uncharted territory,"" he added.","Ian Andre Roberts, the superintendent of the Des Moines Public Schools in Iowa, is a registered active Democrat voter in the state of Maryland.

Pharmacist Shuts Down Trump’s Dangerous MMR Vaccine Advice: ‘Puts Children at Risk’





US President Donald Trump is planning to meet with the top four congressional leaders at the White House on Monday, one day before the federal government faces a potential shutdown, a White House official and congressional sources confirmed.According to news agency AP , House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., along with house Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer will be attending the meeting.The development comes after Trump abruptly cancelled a planned meeting with Democratic leaders on Thursday at the urging of Johnson and Thune, calling Democratic demands “unserious and ridiculous”.The president has faced mounting pressure as the September 30 funding deadline approaches, with Congress needing to pass a spending bill to prevent a shutdown at 12:01 am (local time) on Wednesday.“President Trump has once again agreed to a meeting in the Oval Office,” Schumer and Jeffries said in a joint statement Saturday evening.“We are resolute in our determination to avoid a government shutdown and address the Republican healthcare crisis.Time is running out”, the statement added.Democrats are demanding key health care provisions be attached to any short-term funding measure, including an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies and the reversal of cuts to Medicaid included in earlier Republican legislation, as per AP.Republicans have rejected these conditions as nonstarters, insisting on a straight seven-week extension of current funding. GOP leaders have argued that health care and other policy discussions can occur separately from the emergency spending negotiations.Johnson previously acknowledged encouraging Trump not to meet Democratic leaders until they “do the basic governing work of keeping the government open”.Tensions have escalated in recent days, with the White House Office of Management and Budget instructing federal agencies to prepare reduction-in-force plans in case of a shutdown.A senior White House official described the administration’s approach bluntly and was quoted as saying by Politico, “We’re going to extract maximum pain… Democrats will pay a huge price for this”.Officials said Trump and his allies believe Democrats will be blamed for any disruptions, while GOP members are prepared to repeatedly force votes in the Senate.Despite the posturing, Democrats maintain that the president must negotiate to secure their votes.“In what world do you ask people for their votes without sitting down and having a conversation with them,” said Shalanda Young, former OMB director under President Biden, as per Politico.Every Senate Democrat, except for Pennsylvania’s John Fetterman, voted last week against a clean, seven-week funding measure backed by Republicans.The Monday meeting will be the latest effort to find common ground before federal agencies potentially halt nonessential operations, risking mass layoffs and service disruptions across the country.",US President Donald Trump is planning to meet with the top four congressional leaders at the White House on Monday.

At least four people died in central Arizona after heavy rainfall caused flash flooding, officials said Saturday, with the hardest-hit areas including the historic mining town of Globe, about 88 miles east of Phoenix.Residents were forced to climb onto rooftops as floodwaters swept through downtown streets, overturning vehicles and scattering about 1,000 propane tanks from a local distributorship, as per news agency AP According to NBC News, Carl Melford, Gila County emergency manager, confirmed three deaths in Globe.“We now have a massive search and rescue underway,” he was quoted as saying by AP, noting that authorities were investigating reports of possibly missing residents.In Scottsdale, the fourth victim was identified as 38-year-old Ander Polanco, whose vehicle had been submerged in approximately eight feet of fast-moving water on Friday evening; his body was found Saturday after the waters receded, reported NBC News.The flooding in Globe, a city of around 7,250 residents, occurred after roughly 2.5 inches (6.4 centimetres) of rain fell within 24 hours.Another storm moved in on Saturday, temporarily halting search efforts due to high-flowing creeks.Streets in the nearby mining town of Miami were also flooded, though no injuries were reported there, according to Melford.Mayor Al Gameros said the damage to downtown Globe was extensive, with buildings compromised and hazardous materials, including propane tanks, strewn across the area.“Our primary, again, is search and rescue,” he said. Officials cautioned residents to avoid floodwaters, as volunteer interference could hinder rescue dogs from locating victims.Social media videos showed vehicles being swept away, some smashed against poles, with muddy water carrying debris through the city.Mike Stapleton, Globe’s vice mayor, described reports of trapped residents, including a pregnant woman who had to swim out of a flooded restaurant, and called the devastation “just unbelievable”.Council member Freddy Rios said, “This is something that we could never even imagine, and here we are living it”.Rescue operations included teams from neighbouring counties and the state.Authorities also evacuated about 20 tourists stranded on the Havasupai Indian Reservation, including at scenic Havasu Falls.The National Weather Service reported between 1 and 2 inches of rainfall across metropolitan Phoenix on Friday, including 1.6 inches at the city airport, the highest single-day total in seven years.Hail larger than an inch was observed in some areas, and some self-driving vehicles at Phoenix airport were stuck in floodwaters.Globe city council members declared a state of emergency and urged residents to stay away from downtown until it was deemed safe.Authorities were checking vehicles among debris and assessing structural damage to ensure bridges over local creeks remained stable, as per the New York Times.With further storms expected, officials warned of continued flash flooding risks across Globe, Miami, and neighbouring communities, emphasising the importance of remaining in safe locations until conditions improved.","Floodwaters swept through downtown streets, overturning vehicles and scattering about 1,000 propane tanks from a local distributorship.

New York Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani on Sunday responded to Mayor Eric Adams’ shock decision to drop out of the race just over a month before Election Day, calling it a reflection of Adams’ ties to wealthy donors and national political figures rather than a shift in the city’s priorities.“It is very much the same race,” Mamdani told reporters. “It’s a race between us and the failed politics that we’ve seen, whether it’s Andrew Cuomo or Eric Adams… We’re going to show that they can’t dictate the outcome of this race”, he said, as per ABC 7 New York.Mamdani, who decisively defeated Cuomo in the Democratic primary, emphasised that his campaign remains focused on New Yorkers and the affordability crisis.“New Yorkers deserve leadership that is thinking about how to benefit the people of the city… too often politicians, be it Andrew Cuomo or Eric Adams, the meetings that they have or the phone calls with someone like Donald Trump , they’re only speaking about themselves”, he said, as quoted by democracynow.org.Criticising Adams’ record, Mamdani highlighted rising costs under the mayoralty. “This is a mayor who raised the rent by 12% on more than 2 million New Yorkers… and time and time again, exacerbated a cost-of-living crisis,” he claimed.Mamdani also addressed US President Donald Trump’s involvement and efforts to influence the race.“Donald Trump has spoken time and again about how he wants to narrow this race… yet we’re seeing the moment where he is shaping this race. But we’re going to show him that New Yorkers are tired of his politics and they’re tired of being priced out of the city”, he said, according to The Hill.He issued a pointed message to Cuomo, who has likely benefited from Adams’ exit. “To Andrew Cuomo. You got your wish. You wanted Trump and your billionaire friends to help you clear the field. But don’t forget, you wanted me as your opponent in the primary too, and we beat you by 13 points”.Despite Adams’ withdrawal, Mamdani insisted his campaign strategy remains unchanged. “We will have the same focus as we’ve always had, on working-class New Yorkers, their struggle to afford this city… and making sure the politics of the past do not dictate our future”.In polls, Mamdani currently leads the field with 45% support, ahead of Cuomo at 25%, Sliwa at 9%, and Adams at 8%.",New York Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani on Sunday responded to Mayor Eric Adams' shock decision to drop out of the race.

Stalemate deepens: JD Vance predicts shutdown as White House talks fail; slams Democrats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/stalemate-deepens-jd-vance-predicts-shutdown-as-white-house-talks-fail-slams-democrats/articleshow/124223159.cms,"File photo: US Vice President JD Vance (Picture credit: AP)





The prospect of a federal government shutdown grew stronger on Monday after US President Donald Trump’s White House talks with top congressional leaders ended without a deal.Funding is set to expire at 12:01 am (local time) on Wednesday if no agreement is reached.As per CNBC, Vice President JD Vance predicted the worst outcome, telling reporters, “I think we’re headed to a shutdown because the Democrats won’t do the right thing”.Standing alongside House speaker Mike Johnson and Senate majority leader John Thune, Vance accused Democrats of blocking a “clean” continuing resolution to extend funding until late November.Democrats pushed back, insisting they will not accept a stopgap bill that ignores healthcare protections. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said the parties have “very large differences” but added that Trump “for the first time … heard our objections and heard why we need a bipartisan bill”, as per NBC News.House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries argued Republicans are trying to “gut the health care of everyday Americans.”The stalemate centres on whether temporary funding legislation should also extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, set to expire at year’s end.Democrats argue that without action, millions could face higher premiums when open enrolment begins on 1 November. Jeffries said, “We believe that simply accepting the Republican plan to continue to assault and gut healthcare is unacceptable”, according to news agency Reuters.Republicans counter that Democrats are holding the government “hostage.” Thune said, “What the Democrats have done here is take the federal government as a hostage — and by extension, the American people — to try and get a whole laundry list of things”, as quoted by NBC News.If no resolution is passed, federal agencies will begin furloughing staff, disrupting services from Nasa to national parks. Military personnel would also go unpaid during the closure, though all workers would be compensated once it ends, according to plans already shared by some agencies.Budget standoffs have become a recurring feature in Washington, but Trump’s threat to use the shutdown to permanently slash parts of the federal workforce has added new uncertainty.Only a few agencies have detailed their contingency plans, and Democrats say Trump’s willingness to override spending laws makes this fight riskier than previous standoffs.With the Senate scheduled to vote again on the GOP’s short-term measure on Tuesday — a bill that has already failed once — the chances of a last-minute breakthrough remain slim.Schumer said after Monday’s meeting that the gulf between the two sides remains wide, “There’s still large differences between us.”","US Vice President JD Vance predicted the worst outcome, telling reporters, “I think we’re headed to a shutdown because the Democrats won’t do the right thing” The stalemate centres on whether temporary funding legislation should also extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, set to expire at year's end.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124223167,imgsize-46062,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-14.jpg"
‘Israel is losing information war’: Charlie Kirk’s letter to Netanyahu — Details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/israel-is-losing-the-information-war-charlie-kirks-letter-to-netanyahu-details/articleshow/124223008.cms,"‘Insane Lies’: Netanyahu Hits Back Hard After Israel Dragged Into Kirk Death Conspiracy





Assassinated Conservative activist Charlie Kirk wrote a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this year, according to the New York Post.In a freshly unearthed letter, which was penned down in May, revealed that Kirk warned that Israel isn’t just fighting in Gaza—it’s flunking TikTok. With Gen Z scrolling past pro-Israel hashtags faster than a skipped ad, he frets the Jewish state is “losing the information war,” a slip that, he cautions, could cost them America’s thumbs-up.“My team and I have spent months analysing these trends and debating ideas that could help you and your country push back against these disturbing developments,” he said in the letter, reproduced in full below for the first time. “Anti-Israel sentiment can undermine American support for Israel.”“The purpose of this letter is to lay out our concerns and outline potential remedies. Everything written here is from a place of deep love for Israel and the Jewish people,” Kirk added. He has defended Israel when speaking on college campuses as part of his role leading Turning Point USA, one of the nation’s largest conservative youth organisations.“I think it’s important to be brutally honest with those you love. In my opinion, Israel is losing the information war and needs a ‘communications intervention.’” Netanyahu first referenced the letter in a September 18 video address, eight days after Kirk, 31, was shot and killed during an event at Utah Valley University.Netanyahu disputed “monstrous” falsehoods that Israel was somehow behind the killing. Right-wing pundit Candace Owens and others have asserted that Kirk was being blackmailed into publicly making firm defences of Israel while privately questioning US support for the Jewish state. Pershing Square Capital Management boss Bill Ackman later published private text messages disputing this characterization.In the letter, Kirk urged Netanyahu’s team to cease “subcontracting” rhetorical defences of Israel to American surrogates.He pointed out that, as Turning Point USA’s main voice on American college campuses, he often felt that he was “defending Israel in public” more vigorously than the Prime Minister’s office against accusations and questions, including: “I’m accused of being a paid apologist for Israel when I defend her; however, if I don’t defend Israel strongly enough, I’m accused of being anti-semitic.""“I know you’ve got a seven front war and my kvetching pales in comparison. But I’m trying to convey to you that Israel is losing support even in conservative circles. This should be a five alarm fire.”The late Turning Point USA leader listed seven suggestions for altering public opinion, including establishing a rapid response team on X and other platforms similar to that of President Trump’s White House staff; cultivating pro-Israel experts to fact-check misinformation about the Gaza conflict in real time; and creating an “Israel Truth Network” as a repository of reliable information.“When you don’t push back, anti-Semitism and anti-Israel propaganda fill the void,” he wrote. “A pro-Israel friend recently asked me, ‘Do Israelis even care how the world perceives their country?’"" Kirk also proposed sending some of the hostages released from Gaza on a speaking tour across the US as “very effective messaging.”“Also, these hostages and all your spokespersons should be arguing it’s Hamas that is committing genocide on their own people by using civilians as human shields and storing weapons in schools, hospitals etc,” he added. “That information drips out in the regular media but is almost nonexistent on social media.”Additionally, Kirk advocated for promoting social media posts about everyday life in Israel, where citizens are asked “what they love about their country."" “I’ve seen your IDF spokesman defend Israel standing at a dimly lit podium,” he continued.“This looks like a scene out of the 1970’s – like some old Walter Cronkite clips of the TV news. You need to tear down your old ways of communicating and start over from scratch.” “In my opinion, you are losing the information war which will eventually translate into less political and military support from America,” he concluded. “The Holy Land is so important to my life, and it pains me to see support for Israel slip away. ”Kirk’s alleged assassin, Tyler Robinson, 22, was apprehended the day after the activist’s murder and faces the death penalty on a charge of aggravated murder. Robinson appeared remotely during a brief court hearing on Monday morning, where his defence team requested a preliminary hearing to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to proceed to trial. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for October 30.","Conservative activist Charlie Kirk wrote a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this year.

John informed the police how Sanford asked him questions about the tenets of the Mormon faith, the role fo Jesus in the religion, the history of church and its founder Joseph Smith.“It was very much standard anti-LDS talking points that you would find on YouTube, TikTok, Facebook,” he said. “I just didn’t know what the next question was going to be.”Sanford then said he considered Mormonism ""the antichrist"".John said he recognized Sanford instantly when he started seeing his image on TV and social media posts.“There’s certain things you don’t forget,” he said. “This is not a forgettable guy.”Sanford killed at least four people and injured several others while there were hundreds of congregants inside at the time.Mormons are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), a Christian religious movement that started in the United States in the early 19th century. It was founded in the 820s–1830s by Joseph Smith in upstate New York. Smith said he was guided by visions and divine revelations, including the Book of Mormon, which he published in 1830. They identify as Christians but believe that the original church of Jesus Christ was lost after the early apostles died and restored through Joseph Smith.","Kris John, 44, who is running for a seat on the Burton City Council, told the Detroit Free Press that he met him on September 22.

Israel CANNOT Live In Peace': Egypt Leader's Shock UNGA Address; Big Defence Of Palestine | WATCH

Here's what Trump's 20-point peace plan says



Gaza will be a deradicalized terror-free zone that does not pose a threat to its neighbors. Gaza will be redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza, who have suffered more than enough. War will immediately end if both sides agree to this proposal. Israeli forces will withdraw to the agreed-upon line to prepare for a hostage release. During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal. Within 72 hours of Israel publicly accepting this agreement, all hostages, alive and deceased, will be returned. Once all hostages are released, Israel will release 250 life sentence prisoners plus 1700 Gazans who were detained after October 7th 2023, including all women and children detained in that context. For every Israeli hostage whose remains are released, Israel will release the remains of 15 deceased Gazans. The plan calls for Gaza to “be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza. “Once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty,” the proposal says. “Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries.” “Upon acceptance of this agreement, full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip.” At a minimum, aid quantities will be consistent with what was included in the January 19, 2025. Entry of distribution and aid in the Gaza Strip will proceed without interference from the two parties. A Trump economic development plan to rebuild and energize Gaza will be created by convening a panel of experts. A special economic zone will be established with preferred tariff and access rates to be negotiated with participating countries. No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return. Hamas and other factions agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form. A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people. The United States will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) to immediately deploy in Gaza. Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza. As the ISF establishes control and stability, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will withdraw. In the event Hamas delays or rejects this proposal, the above, including the scaled-up aid operation, will proceed in the terror-free areas handed over from the IDF to the ISF. An interfaith dialogue process will be established based on the values of tolerance and peaceful co-existence to try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis. While Gaza re-development advances and when the PA reform program is faithfully carried out, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood. The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous co-existence





President Donald Trump called it a 'historic day' after his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ended and he thanked Bibi for agreeing to the plan on Gaza. Trump announced the creation of the Board of Peace as part of his 20-point plan to bring ""eternal peace"" in the Middle East. The board will be headed by Trump and will include ""highly qualified experts,"" Palestinian representatives and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, the president said.""First time in thousands of years, I think you can probably say, if you really look into it, if you study back, if you’re a scholar, you would say thousands of years. Israel would have my full backing to finish the job of destroying the threat of Hamas. But i hope we’re going to have a deal for peace. If Hamas rejects the deal, which is always possible, they’re the only one left. Everyone else has accepted it. But I have a feeling that we’re going to have a positive answer. But if not, as you know, Bibi, you’d have our full backing to do what you would have to do,"" Trump said while sitting alongside Netanyahu at the White House.""Hamas and other terrorist factions will play no role in the board, but they’ll play no role in the governance of Gaza at all, directly or indirectly.As you know, thousands of Hamas leaders have been killed and soldiers have been killed. And we can never forget October seventh, but thousands have paid the price for that.,"" he added.The countries that played a role in peace talks between Israel and Hamas include Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, Jordan, Indonesia, Egypt and Pakistan, Trump said. If Hamas does not agree to the plan, Trump said he would back Netanyahu to ""do what he has to do"".As Netanyahu started speaking, he first thanked President Trump for the deal. He called Trump the ""greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House"" and says no one else comes close. Netanyahu said all hostages --living and dead -- should be returned within 72 hours. He said all parties are being given the chance to do this peacefully, but if Hamas rejects the plan, or they supposedly accept it then don't follow through, ""we will finish the job"", he said.""This can be done the easy way or it can be done the hard way, but it will be done,"" he said.","President Donald Trump called it a 'historic day' after his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ended.

'Trump A Threat To New York': Zohran Mamdani Challenges U.S. President On Takeover By National Guard





US President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to withhold federal funds from New York City if it voted for Democrat candidate Zohran Mamdani as mayor, setting him on a collision course with progressive American cities and states that lean Democratic and also generate more revenue.In a Monday morning Truth Social post, Trump bluntly said, “he (Mamdani) is going to have problems with Washington like no Mayor in the history of our once great City. Remember, he needs the money from me, as president, in order to fulfill all of his fake communist promises. He won’t be getting any of it, so what’s the point of voting for him?”Trump’s threat shocked Democrats, some of whom warned that if the president is going to withhold federal funds from NYC if Mamdani is elected mayor, then NYC should stop paying federal taxes.Blue states such as California and New York typically generate more tax revenue and lead in total tax collection compared to Red MAGA-voting states. They also contribute more in federal taxes than they receive back in federal funding. Demands to withhold federal contributions have also been heard in California, which is also at the receiving end of Trump’s ire.Mamdani, whose mother is the Indian filmmaker Mira Nair, is leading by double digits against his nearest rival, Independent Andrew Cuomo, in the Mayoral election set for November 4, 2025.His funky, social media-driven campaign has energised the progressive left wing of the Democratic Party whom Trump characterises as communists.Trump’s MAGA radicals are also attacking Mamdani’s part- Muslim heritage (his father Mahmood Mamdani is a Ugandan Muslim of Indian heritage, born in Mumbai), warning that he will “jihadise” NYC just as they believe Mayor Sadiq Khan has done with London. The idea of two of the world’s leading cities being led by men of Muslim faith had triggered MAGA fundamentalists who believe the UK and the US need to re-establish Christian primacy.“President Trump says it won’t matter if Mamdani is Mayor because he won’t release federal funds to Mamdani. Sadly, it’s going to be very bad for our country & the party when Mamdani is Mayor because his Islamic ideology will inspire acts of Jihad that get innocent people killed,” Trump acolyte and social media gadabout Linda Loomer, who wields enormous influence in the Trump White House, wrote on X.Loomer has also gotten after California lawmaker, Ro Khanna, who represents Silicon Valley, accusing him of sharing a stage with HAMAS supporters over the weekend at an Arab Conference, and calling him a “self hating Hindu...who acts more like a Muslim” while “real Hindus are being slaughtered by jihadists”","US President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funds from New York City if it voted for Democrat candidate Zohran Mamdani as mayor.

He earned several awards during his four years of service, including the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the National Defense Service Medal.A GoFundMe page from 2015 raised more than $3,000 for Sanford and his wife’s now-10-year-old son, who was reportedly born with congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI), a rare genetic condition in which the pancreas releases too much insulin.""This appears to be yet another targeted attack on Christians in the United States of America,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “THIS EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY MUST END, IMMEDIATELY!” he added.White House spokesperson said Sanford hated the people of the Mormon faith. “From what I understand based on my conversations with the FBI director, all they know right now is this was an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith,” Leavitt told Fox News.The recent mass violence followed a pattern of MAGA accusing the assassin of being a left liberal immediately after the identification came out. But after the Michigan church shooting, it was for the Left to attack.
