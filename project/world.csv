"Resignation twist: Bhupen Borah quits Congress, pauses decision, Himanta’s BJP offer follows — row explained",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/resignation-twist-bhupen-borah-quits-congress-pauses-decision-himantas-bjp-offer-follows-row-explained/articleshow/128448201.cms,"NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday invited former Assam Congress chief Bhupen Borah to join the BJP , hours after Borah submitted his resignation from the party, triggering political upheaval in the poll-bound state.Sarma said the BJP’s doors were open for Borah and promised to help him get elected from a “safe seat” if he joined. He also announced that he would visit Borah’s residence to discuss his future plans.“If he wants to join the BJP, we will welcome him, but even if he does not want to do so, we extend our best wishes to him,” Sarma told reporters.Sarma described Borah as the “last Hindu leader” in the Congress without a family background holding ministerial or legislative posts and said his resignation sent a larger message about internal democracy in the party.“His resignation carries the symbolic message that in the Congress, no one from a normal family can prosper. Congress does not give recognition to people from ordinary families, but I hail from an ordinary middle-class family and the BJP has made me a chief minister. We stay opposite to the politics of blue blood,” he said.Drawing a parallel with his own political journey, Sarma added, “Even Sarma was forced to leave the party as he was not made CM despite the support of 58 MLAs.Is this internal democracy? How long will this kind of politics continue? Somebody has to raise their voice, and I have done so.”In Guwahati, senior Congress leaders maintained that Borah had reconsidered his decision following intervention by the party high command.AICC Assam in-charge Jitendra Singh said party president Mallikarjun Kharge and senior leader Rahul Gandhi had spoken to Borah.“The party leadership has discussed the matter with Borah. Rahul Gandhi also spoke to him for 15 minutes,” Singh told reporters outside Borah’s residence.“This is our internal matter; we discussed in detail about the issues bothering him and I thank him for agreeing to withdraw his resignation,” he said.However, Borah clarified that he had only sought time to reconsider.“My old colleagues and the party's central leadership came to my house, and I respect them. I have sought time till tomorrow morning so that I can talk to my family and take a decision in this regard,” he said.In a late-night interaction, Borah confirmed that he had sent his resignation after 32 years in the party.“The resignation letter has been sent, but the central leadership has said it will not accept it,” Borah said, adding, “I cannot give directions to the central leadership, but I have asked for time to think about it and will inform them by tomorrow.”He said he was consulting senior leaders and well-wishers before taking a final call.“Many senior leaders and colleagues have asked me to consider all aspects, but nobody has said that I did anything wrong by sending the resignation letter,” he said.Responding to Sarma’s statement about visiting his residence, Borah said, “If any CM wants to visit my home, it is a matter of pride for me.”Borah, who served as Assam Congress president from 2021 to 2025 and was replaced by Gaurav Gogoi last year, has been a two-time MLA.Senior Congress leaders including Gogoi, MP Pradyut Bordoloi, Leader of Opposition Debabrata Saikia and other MLAs met Borah after he sent his resignation letter to Kharge, alleging that he was being “ignored” by the party leadership and not being accorded his due in the state unit.Gogoi described Borah as a “pillar of strength” for the party.“I apologise to him as a younger brother if he felt hurt due to certain issues in the party,” he said.The United Opposition Forum, Assam, also appealed to Borah to stay. Its spokesperson and Raijor Dal president Akhil Gogoi said the forum would not allow him to switch sides.“No one from the united opposition will let him join the BJP even if PM Narendra Modi or Home Minister Amit Shah comes. He was, is and will remain with us. Who will let him go...we will carry him everywhere with us,” Gogoi said.He alleged that the Chief Minister was trying to create confusion by suggesting Borah would join the BJP but added, “this will not happen...we will not let it happen.”With Borah seeking time until Tuesday morning to take a final decision, his political future remains uncertain, even as the BJP steps up its outreach and the Congress leadership attempts to contain the fallout ahead of the Assembly polls.",Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma invited Bhupen Borah to join the BJP. Sarma said the BJP’s doors were open for Borah and promised to help him get elected from a “safe seat” if he joined.

"Villages in Noida in grip of child-lifting rumours; parents quit jobs, change shifts: ‘We can’t take chances’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/villages-in-noida-in-grip-of-child-lifting-rumours/articleshow/128401541.cms,"Image used for representative purpose only

Noida: Yamuna Illegal Mining Patrols, Jaypee Projects Under Scrutiny, Waste Plant Clash And More





NOIDA: Guddi has quit two cooking jobs so she can be home at Sarfabad early each afternoon. Her six-year-old son walks back from school, and the fear of what might happen on the way has become overwhelming.""Once children leave the school gate, the school authorities say that they are not responsible,"" she said. ""That scared many of us. We can't take chances.""Guddi's decision was driven by panic as rumours of girls going missing swirled through village pockets across Noida, with unverified claims of child lifters spreading rapidly in recent weeks. Neighbourhood conversations and social media forwards have triggered panic among parents despite repeated assurances from police and NGOs that there is no evidence to support them.The latest rumours, similar to the pre-Covid hysteria about children going missing — which led to several lynchings and WhatsApp enforcing curbs on forwards — have been triggered by a report circulating on social media in Jan about girls going missing in Delhi, police said.Senior police officers told TOI that no complaint or verified report of a child abduction had been received. “These appear to be hoaxes, possibly triggered by misleading social media messages,” an officer said, urging residents to avoid spreading unverified information.Fear has nonetheless reshaped daily routines. Several women have quit jobs, men have changed shifts, children are not being sent to school, and locals are putting up watches for child lifters. “We rush back every day to be with our children,” said another domestic staffer from Sarfabad, who works in a nearby high-rise society. “Even if this turns out to be false, the fear is real.”Several non-profits and schools reported a visible impact. Mala Bhandari, founder of a Noida-based NGO, said attendance dropped sharply in centres operating in Nagla, Tugalpur and Haldoni. “Parents stopped sending children altogether,” she said. “When our team did field visits, we found no incidents.”Another NGO temporarily shut operations after first hearing the rumour from children. “We closed for a few days because attendance dropped,” the owner said. “When we cross-checked with families, no one had seen or knew a victim. It was unverified talk, but the panic had already spread.”Primary schools in nearby villages reported similar disruptions. A teacher in Harola said attendance dropped as rumours intensified, though follow-ups revealed no abduction cases. “Some absences were also for personal reasons, like family weddings,” she said.In some schools, the response was precautionary. Sunita, a teacher at a private school in one of the villages, said the management circulated consent forms asking parents to pre-declare how children would commute and who would collect them. “Students are released only to authorised guardians,” she said. “There are no such cases here that we know of, but awareness feels necessary.”A police officer said such episodes are not new. Similar rumours have surfaced in the past, briefly fuelling fear before being debunked. The concern, they added, is that misinformation, especially when amplified online, can quickly disrupt community life and strain trust.The panic echoes 2018 and 2019, when India witnessed a spate of mob violence sparked by suspicions of child lifting, many of them triggered by viral WhatsApp messages. According to data compiled by Centre for Study of Society and Secularism, there were 41 reported incidents of mob violence in 2018 linked to such rumours, making child-lifting fears the leading trigger that year. Though National Crime Records Bureau does not maintain data for mob lynching, making comprehensive tracking difficult, at least 20 people were killed in the mob attack during the period.","Unverified claims of child lifters spreading rapidly in Noida, India.

Indian coastal authorities 'seize' 3 US-sanctioned oil tankers linked to Iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-coastal-authorities-seize-3-us-sanctioned-oil-tankers-linked-to-iran/articleshow/128437223.cms,"Photo: File photo of oil vessel Asphalt Star

NEW DELHI: Indian coastal authorities reportedly “seized three US-sanctioned tanker ships linked to Iran” earlier this month, a source informed TOI on Monday. The vessel seizures follow the improvement in India-US relations with Washington announcing recently that it would cut import tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50%.In a related development, US military forces boarded another sanctioned tanker in the Indian Ocean after tracking the vessel from the Caribbean Sea, in an effort to target illicit oil trade connected to Venezuela, the Pentagon said on Sunday.‘Shadow fleet’ vessels Stellar Ruby, Asphalt Star and Al Jafzia carrying sanctioned Iranian oil were seized on Feb 6. India’s unprecedented enforcement action took place the same day that Washington and New Delhi unveiled a major bilateral trade framework.Indian coastal authorities said in a post on X on Feb 6 that they had intercepted the three vessels about 100 nautical miles west of Mumbai after detecting suspicious activity involving a tanker in India's exclusive economic zone. However, the post was later deleted.Stellar Ruby, Asphalt Star and Al Jafzia frequently changed their identities to evade action by coastal states, and their owners were based overseas, it was said.According to Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), a Washington DC-based research institute, “All three were previously sanctioned by the US for their ties to Iran. They form part of a 30-tanker fleet managed by Jugwinder Singh Brar, a UAE-based Indian national designated by the Treasury Department in April 2025 for operating in the petroleum sector of the Iranian economy. The Stellar Ruby was still flying an Iranian flag at the time of the seizure”.Importantly, Iran too had seized an oil tanker, MT Valiant Roar, on Dec 8 with 16 Indian crew members on board. Of the 16, eight have been released, but eight are still in Iran’s custody. Their families have been demanding the release of the sailors.As for US forces boarding another sanctioned tanker in the Indian Ocean, Venezuela has faced US sanctions on its oil for several years and relied on a shadow fleet of falsely flagged tankers to smuggle crude into global supply chains. President Donald Trump ordered a quarantine of sanctioned tankers in Dec to pressure then-President Nicolás Maduro -- Maduro was apprehended in Jan during an American military operation.Several tankers fled the Venezuelan coast in the wake of the raid, including the ship that was boarded in the Indian Ocean overnight. The Defense Department said in a post on X that US forces had boarded Veronica III, conducting “a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction and boarding.” “The vessel tried to defy President Trump’s quarantine — hoping to slip away,” the Pentagon said. “We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance and shut it down,” it added.",Indian coastal authorities reportedly ‘seized three US-sanctioned tanker ships linked to Iran’ Vessel seizures follow the improvement in India-US relations with Washington announcing it would cut import tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50%.

NEW DELHI: The mother of a 23-year-old man who died in a road accident in Dwarka earlier this month has posted an emotional video on social media, alleging that her son was killed by a minor who was driving an SUV recklessly while making “speed fun reels”.Sahil Dhaneshra died in the accident on February 3 near Lal Bahadur Shastri College in Dwarka. In a video message shared on Sunday, his mother appealed to the government, media and local residents to help her seek justice.“I raised my child for 23 years as a single mother. On February 3, my innocent child was blown away by a car. I am a helpless mother,” she said in the video posted on X.In a post accompanying the video, she wrote, “I lost my son Sahil Dhaneshra, a 22+ year old young and most talented boy whom I raised for 23 years alone as a single mom, was killed brutally by a Scorpio N bearing no. UP57BM3057. Driver is an unlicensed driver and his sister while making speed fun reels in Dwarka.”She urged parents to remain vigilant about road safety and appealed to the public to come forward in her support.According to Delhi Police, a fatal accident was reported at around 11.57 am on February 3. When officers reached the spot, they found an SUV, a car and a motorcycle in a damaged condition. The motorcycle rider, later identified as Sahil Dhaneshra, was found dead at the scene.Ajit Singh, who had parked his taxi on the roadside, was also injured in the incident and was taken to IGI Hospital. Police said that the final medical opinion on his medico-legal case (MLC) is awaited.A case was registered at Dwarka South Police Station under sections 281 (rash driving), 106(1) (causing death by negligence) and 125(a) (act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).During the investigation, the SUV driver was identified as 17-year-old Akshatra Singh. Police said he did not possess a valid driving licence and was apprehended. The minor was produced before the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) and sent to an observation home.He was granted interim bail on February 10 by the JJB on the ground that he is a Class 10 student and due to appear for his examinations, police said.All three vehicles involved in the accident have been seized and mechanically inspected. CCTV footage from the area has also been collected as part of the ongoing investigation.According to preliminary findings, the SUV allegedly collided with the motorcycle coming from the opposite direction before hitting a parked car on the roadside. Police said that the matter remains under investigation.","Sahil Dhaneshra died in the accident on February 3 near Lal Bahadur Shastri College in Dwarka.

"In its war against Reds, CRPF is now wiping out Maoist 'memorials'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-its-war-against-reds-crpf-is-now-wiping-out-maoist-memorials/articleshow/128441446.cms,"Over the last 15 days, CRPF has demolished 53 ‘memorials’ across Sukma, Bijapur and Bastar

NEW DELHI: As the country moves towards becoming Naxalism-free by March 31, it's not just the last of Maoist leaders and cadres that are being hunted or asked to surrender. The physical symbols of Left-wing extremism -- specifically, 'memorials' built by CPI(Maoist) to ""honour"" its top leaders and commanders killed over the years -- are also being wiped out in mission mode, ensuring that the once Naxal-infested villages are never reminded of their violent and troubled past.In line with home minister Amit Shah's directions, reiterated at the Feb 8 review of Left-wing extremism in Raipur, the Central Reserve Police Force ( CRPF ) has, over the last 15 days, demolished 53 such 'memorials' across Sukma, Bijapur and Bastar in Chhattisgarh. Backed by location-mapping of these 'memorials', often with help from the locals, the CRPF is targeting the demolition of all by February end. This will be followed up with a plantation drive in the cleared areas, so that they merge with the surrounding forests, said a CRPF source.CRPF has been at the forefront of the multi-state offensive to reclaim Maoists' pocket-boroughs and has a predominant presence in the interior villages of Bastar region through forward-operating bases.Among the CPI(Maoist) 'memorials' -- usually tiered, concrete structures shaped like a pyramid or pagoda, some topped with CPI(Maoist) insignia -- razed by earthmovers over the past fortnight were ones erected following the neutralisation of its general secretary Namballa Keshava Rao alias Basavaraju in Narayanpur in May 2025 and of central committee member Ramachandra Pratap Reddy @ Chalapathi (CC) in Gariyaband in Jan 2025.""CRPF is very close to the goal of uprooting Left-wing extremism from the country. Its efforts now extend to eliminating the fear of Maoists from the minds of people of Chhattisgarh, particularly tribals of Bastar who have borne the brunt of decades of Left-wing extremist violence. When the villagers see these 'memorials' reduced to dust by earthmovers, tractors, rope and hammers, without a murmur of protest or confrontation by any Naxal, a clear message goes regarding the fall of Maoism,"" a senior CRPF officer told TOI.A second officer said the fallen CPI(Maoist) 'memorials' also rule out any potential rallying or meeting points for ""residual"" Naxals or Maoist sympathisers. ""It's a strong message rejecting Maoist ideology and reflects a change in mindset,"" the officer added.While a CPI(Maoist) 'memorial' in Mirtoor, Bijapur was demolished on Feb 9, one each in Bijapur and Sukma was razed on Feb 11. Six 'memorial structures' were bulldozed in Sukma and Bijapur on Feb 12, and another nine and five on Feb 13 and 14 respectively.","Over the last 15 days, CRPF has demolished 53 ‘memorials’ across Sukma, Bijapur and Bastar in Chhattisgarh.

'We Are United...Will Go To Delhi If High Command Calls': Siddaramaiah, Shivakumar After Meeting

BENGALURU: A foreign tour by a bloc of Congress legislators aligned with CM Siddaramaiah has injected volatility into Karnataka politics, sharpening a power struggle with deputy CM DK Shivakumar over a long-speculated transition.About 27 Congress MLAs and MLCs are set to leave for Australia and NZ Tuesday, party insiders said. Legislators insist the travel is routine, but within the party it is seen as a tactical move to undercut Shivakumar's push for a Congress legislature party meeting to press for a change at the top.Congress returned to office in 2023 amid talk of an unwritten power-sharing deal under which DKS would succeed Siddaramaiah. Anticipating a leadership push before budget session March 6, Siddaramaiah camp is said to have encouraged select legislators to travel.

'How can you indulge in physical relationship before marriage': SC goes 'old-fashioned',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-can-you-indulge-in-physical-relationship-before-marriage-sc-goes-old-fashioned/articleshow/128422310.cms,"NEW DELHI: Calling itself ""old-fashioned"", the Supreme Court on Monday questioned how two people could indulge in a physical relationship before marriage, even if it is consensual. The bench comprising Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan was hearing the bail application of a man accused of rape on the pretext of marriage. It questioned the complainant about why she had travelled to Dubai, where the two engaged in a physical relationship.""It's consensual. We may be old-fashioned but a boy and girl before marriage are total strangers. They should be circumspect in indulging in physical relationships before marriage,"" PTI quoted the bench observed.""Whatever may be the thick and thin of their relationship, we fail to understand how they can be indulging in physical relationship before marriage. Maybe we are old- fashioned but you must be very careful, nobody should believe anybody before marriage,"" Justice Nagarathna said.The woman’s counsel submitted that the two met through a matrimonial website in 2022, and that the accused allegedly entered into a physical relationship with her on several occasions in Delhi and later in Dubai on the false assurance of marriage.""She should not have gone before marriage if she was so strict about it. We will send them to mediation. These are not cases which are to be tried and convicted when there is consensual relationship,"" Justice Nagarathna said in response to this.In her complaint, the woman alleged that the man persuaded her to travel to Dubai, where he established physical relations with her on the false promise of marriage, recorded intimate videos without her consent, and threatened to circulate them. She later discovered that he had married another woman in Punjab in January 2024.Both the trial court and the Delhi high court had rejected his bail plea, with the high court observing that the promise of marriage appeared false from the outset, especially since he was already married and remarried in January 2024. The man has now approached the Supreme Court seeking bail.Justice Nagarathna suggested that the accused consider paying compensation to the woman to resolve the matter, while the bench also asked her counsel to explore the possibility of a settlement. The case has been posted for Wednesday to ascertain both sides’ positions.","The Supreme Court questioned how two people could indulge in a physical relationship before marriage, even if it is consensual.

'Tremendous Alliance': Netanyahu Highlights India's Love For Israel Ahead Of PM Modi's Visit

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday jabbed the Centre after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s upcoming visit to Israel, saying India was learning about its own government’s decisions from foreign leaders.PM Modi is set to travel to Israel on a two-day visit from February 25 to 26, news agency PTI repeorted citing sources. The visit was first mentioned by Netanyahu while addressing the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organisations on Sunday.Reacting to this, Congress general secretary (communications) Jairam Ramesh in a post on X wrote, “India hears of the halt to Operation Sindoor first from the US Secretary of State. India hears of the India-US trade deal first from the US President.”“Just now India has heard of Prime Minister Modi’s dates for his visit to Israel first from Mr. Netanyahu - who has reduced Gaza to rubble and dust and is now dispossessing and displacing more Palestinians in the occupied West Bank,” Ramesh added.The Congress remarks also referred to the recently concluded interim India-US trade agreement, which was first announced by US President Donald Trump on his Truth Social platform earlier this month.The party alleged that key diplomatic and trade decisions were being communicated abroad before being formally shared in India.“Parliament address on the anvil. Who’s coming here next week? Narendra Modi,” Netanyahu said at the gathering, highlighting what he described as a “tremendous alliance” between India and Israel.Meanwhile, a source in Jerusalem told PTI that PM Modi’s visit is “likely to be short from February 25 to 26”, but added that “its impact is deep given the popularity PM Modi enjoys not only in Israel but around the world”.The programme for the visit is still being worked out. However, PM Modi is expected to address the Israeli Knesset during his stay and discuss bilateral and regional issues. This will be his second visit to Israel, after his landmark trip in July 2017, the first-ever visit by an Indian Prime Minister to the Jewish state.Netanyahu, speaking about the upcoming visit, described India as “enormously powerful” and “enormously popular” and said both sides would discuss expanding cooperation.India has consistently supported a “two-state solution” to the Israel-Gaza conflict, while also maintaining a strategic partnership with Israel.Last year, PM Modi and Netanyahu held a telephonic conversation and reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties.PM Modi had then said, “Spoke with my friend Prime Minister Netanyahu. We reviewed progress in the India-Israel Strategic Partnership and agreed to further strengthen our cooperation. Also reaffirmed our shared commitment to zero tolerance for terrorism. India supports all efforts aimed at achieving a just and durable peace in the region.”Netanyahu’s own visit to India has been on hold since 2023 following the October 7 Hamas attacks, which disrupted planned engagements.","PM Modi is set to travel to Israel on a two-day visit from February 25 to 26.

Women's entry in Sabarimala not a govt order: Kerala minister

NEW DELHI:A nine-judge bench of SC will on April 7 start hearing one of the most contentious disputes between faith and fundamental rights, arising from its Sept 2018 judgment that allowed women of all ages to enter Sabarimala temple , which had customarily barred entry of females of menstruating age.The judgment had triggered a series of petitions seeking its review and pleas for similar rulings on PILs that had sought entry of women into mosques, abolition of the practice of khatna (female genital mutilation) among Dawoodi Bohra community members and pleas for entry of Parsi women who have married outside their community into fire temple.A bench of CJI Surya Kant, Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi said it would hear the batches of appeal separately and examine the core issue - the conflict between faith-based customs and women's fundamental rights. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta supported petitions seeking review of Sabarimala judgment without elaborating on Centre's stand.Kerala law minister P Rajeev said on Monday that the state govt still has time to clarify its stand on the issue of women entering the Sabarimala temple, and that the matter cannot be reduced to a ""yes or no"" answer.""Several constitutional complications are involved in it. All aspects need to be considered,"" Rajeev said. He added that govt's action at the time of the earlier controversy was in compliance with the SC verdict. ""It was not a govt order ... The apex court verdict is naturally binding,"" he said. Asked whether govt would support or seek a modification of the practice, Rajeeve said faith and social reform must go together and that this was govt's stand in its affidavit before the court.","A nine-judge bench of SC will on April 7 start hearing one of the most contentious disputes between faith and fundamental rights, arising from its Sept 2018 judgment that allowed women of all ages to enter Sabarimala temple.

NEW DELHI: With the number of rape complaints, arising out of false promise of marriage, on the rise, Supreme Court Monday cautioned young men and women about pre-marital physical relationships, even it admitted that the view may be branded as old-fashioned.Hearing the bail plea of a man who is facing prosecution for rape over a false promise of marriage, Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan raised questions over how the woman in question had agreed to go with the man to Dubai, where the two had a physical relationship.""It's consensual. We may be old-fashioned, but a boy and girl before marriage are total strangers. They should be circumspect in indulging in physical relationships before marriage,"" the bench observed.""Whatever may be the thick and thin of their relationship, we fail to understand how they can be indulging in physical relationship before marriage... you must be very careful; nobody should believe anybody before marriage,"" Justice Nagarathna said.In the case, the complainant claimed that she had travelled to Dubai on the man's insistence, and he had established physical relations with her under the pretext of marriage, only to marry someone else later.Justice Nagarathna said such cases are not suitable for trial and conviction and suggested that the parties be referred for mediation. It asked the two parties to explore the possibility of settlement and posted the matter for hearing on Wednesday to ascertain their views.""She should not have gone before marriage if she was so strict about it. We will send them for mediation. These are not cases which are to be tried and convicted, when there is a consensual relationship,"" she said.","Justices B V Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan raised questions over how the woman in question had agreed to go with the man to Dubai, where the two had a physical relationship.

I sought time...Either today or tomorrow morning, I will meet Jitendra Singh (AICC's Assam minder) and convey my final decision,"" Borah told reporters after a three-hour meeting with a party delegation.Singh insisted Borah had already withdrawn his resignation, at which the latter clarified he needed to consult his family.""I never made public what I wrote in my letter.

Sonam Wangchuk's Wife Blasts Modi Govt & CRPF Over 6Th Schedule, Dismisses FCRA, Pak Link Charges

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday questioned the Centre over the accuracy of video transcripts submitted against detained climate activist Sonam Wangchuk and said translations must be precise, especially “in the era of Artificial Intelligence.”A bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and PB Varale asked the government to place on record the actual transcripts of Wangchuk’s speeches after senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for his wife Gitanjali Angmo, argued that certain statements attributed to the activist were never made by him.Addressing Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj, the bench said, “Mr Solicitor, we want an actual transcript of the speech. What he relied upon and what you say are different. We will decide. There should be an actual transcript of what he says. You may have your reasons.”The top court further observed, “At least, whatever he stated, the true translation should be there. Your translation goes on for 7 to 8 minutes, but the speech is for 3 minutes. We are in the era of Artificial Intelligence; precision is at least 98 per cent for translation.”Sibal questioned the authenticity of the translated material placed before the court and said, “Wangchuk continued his strike and also continued to provoke youth by taking reference of Nepal. Where is this line coming from? This is a very unique detention order — you rely on something that does not exist and then you say it is based on subjective satisfaction.”In response, Nataraj told the bench that there is a separate department that prepares transcripts and said, “We are not experts in it.”The matter will now be heard again on Thursday.The apex body is hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by Wangchuk’s wife, seeking a declaration that his detention under the National Security Act (NSA), 1980, is illegal.The NSA allows the Centre and state governments to detain individuals to prevent them from acting in a manner “prejudicial to the defence of India.” The maximum period of detention under the law is 12 months, although it can be revoked earlier.Wangchuk, a climate activist known for his work in Ladakh, was detained on September 26 last year, two days after violent protests in Leh over demands for statehood and Sixth Schedule status left four people dead and around 90 injured. He is currently lodged in Jodhpur Central Jail.Earlier hearings saw sharp exchanges between the Centre and the court. The government has justified the detention, alleging that Wangchuk made inflammatory speeches, attempted to internationalise the issue of Ladakh and drew comparisons with Chinese and Pakistani provinces.It also claimed that he tried to instigate youth and referred to protests in Nepal and Bangladesh, including “Arab Spring-like agitations.”Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had told the bench that all procedural safeguards under the NSA were “scrupulously complied with” and that Wangchuk was being treated fairly in jail. “This court is dealing with a person who is instigating people in a border area, adjacent to Pakistan and China, where regional sensitivity is involved,” Mehta had said.On the issue of health, Mehta told the court that Wangchuk had been medically examined 24 times since his detention. “We have examined his health periodically 24 times. He is fit, hale and hearty. He had some digestive issues; he is being treated. There is nothing to worry about, nothing alarming. We can't make exceptions like this,” he said.He added, “The grounds on which the detention order was passed continue. It will not be possible to release him on health grounds. It may not be desirable either. We have given utmost consideration.”However, Angmo has argued that the violence in Leh on September 24 cannot be attributed to Wangchuk’s actions or statements. She told the court that Wangchuk had himself condemned the violence on social media and had described it as the “saddest day” of his life, saying it would lead to the failure of Ladakh’s peaceful “tapasya” of five years.In earlier proceedings, the Supreme Court had asked the Centre whether there was any possibility of rethinking the detention and had directed authorities to place the original file related to the detention before it. The court had also directed that Wangchuk be examined by a specialised doctor and that the medical report be submitted.","The Supreme Court on Monday questioned the accuracy of video transcripts submitted against detained climate activist Sonam Wangchuk.

NEW DELHI: A civil court in Karnataka on Monday sentenced three men to death for sexually assaulting an Israeli tourist and murdering a youth in Koppal district last year.The Gangavathi Civil Court pronounced the quantum of punishment, awarding capital punishment to the convict: Mallesh alias Handi Malla, Sharanabasava and Chaitanya Sai. The court had found them guilty on February 7 and had reserved its order on sentencing for February 16.According to the prosecution, the crime took place near Sanapur on March 6 last year and had drawn international attention, casting a shadow over tourism in the region.Public Prosecutor Nagalakshmi said that the incident occurred when a homestay owner took a group of tourists: Pankaj from Maharashtra, Bibhas from Odisha, Daniel from the United States, and an Israeli woman, for stargazing near the Tungabhadra canal under the limits of the Gangavathi rural police station at around 10.30 pm.At that time, the three accused allegedly arrived on a motorcycle and picked up a fight over a financial dispute.“With an intention to rape these women, the convicts pushed the three men into the canal. To ensure that they do not come out, they threw stones on them. Later, they gang raped the home-stay owner and the Israeli national,” Nagalakshmi told reporters.She said Bibhas Kumar died due to drowning in the canal. “Pankaj did not know how to swim but Daniel saved him,” she added.After the assault, the accused allegedly fled the spot with mobile phones, cash and a camera belonging to the victims.“It was a case of gang rape, murder, attempt to murder, robbery and extortion. Hence the Judge Sadananda Nagappa Naik under section 103 of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita gave them capital punishment. For the gang rape, the court ordered imprisonment till their last breath,” the public prosecutor said.She added that the convicts have the right to appeal against the sentence in a higher court.","A civil court in Karnataka on Monday sentenced three men to death for sexually assaulting an Israeli tourist and murdering a youth.

Tamil Nadu: Congress vs Congress erupts as Stalin refuses to blink,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tamil-nadu-congress-vs-congress-erupts-as-stalin-refuses-to-blink/articleshow/128418975.cms,"'To Remove Corrupt DMK': TTV Dhinakaran Meets Goyal As AMMK Rejoins NDA Ahead Of Tamil Nadu Polls

NEW DELHI: The simmering debate over power sharing in Tamil Nadu has triggered not just friction between the Congress and its ally, the DMK, but also exposed sharp internal rift within the Congress itself, with the state leadership moving swiftly to rein in dissenting voices as CM MK Stalin drew a firm red line on power sharing.Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) president K Selvaperunthagai on Monday publicly rebuked party MP Manickam Tagore for raising the issue of power sharing with the ruling DMK at a district-level meeting in Madurai. Selvaperunthagai asked pointedly whether anyone in the party considered themselves ""bigger than the AICC leadership"".The warning came amid renewed strain in the Congress–DMK relationship after Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin dismissed demands for a share in governance as a ""conspiracy"", even while insisting that the alliance remained intact.Selvaperunthagai said the AICC had already issued clear instructions that alliance matters should not be discussed publicly, news agency PTI reported. ""Our leaders Rahul Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge and KC Venugopal have clearly asked us not to express views on alliances in public. I strictly follow those instructions,"" he said, adding that airing such views ahead of the assembly elections only created confusion.He was responding to the February 15 meeting of the Madurai South District Congress Committee, held at Tirupparankundram under Tagore’s leadership, which reportedly passed resolutions seeking power sharing with the DMK. While Selvaperunthagai said he was unaware of the resolutions, he underlined that the party had already constituted a five-member committee under Girish Chodankar to hold talks with the DMK on seat sharing, and that any discussions must remain within that framework.Meanwhile, Congress MP Karti Chidambaram also also clarified in an interview to ANI that the party remains committed to the INDIA bloc and its alliance in Tamil Nadu, led by the DMK.""We are in an INDIA alliance. We have to look at it from a national perspective. The DMK is a very important part of the INDIA alliance nationally because they contribute a significant number of MPs to our bloc. And we are part of the INDIA alliance in Tamil Nadu, which the DMK leads. The Chief Minister has categorically confirmed the alliance, and there's no doubt about that,"" he said.Chidambaram acknowledged that while long-standing alliances may have inherent tensions and expectations, it would not be pragmatic to exit a stable formation.""The DMK is a well-oiled political machine. To somehow get minor issues and ditch that, in my opinion, will not be pragmatic. There are voices within the Congress party which are giving other options. As an active political party, we will notice what's happening around us,"" he said.The internal rebuke follows Tagore's sharp public pushback against Stalin’s remarks. After the CM termed the power-sharing demand a ""problem created by some people"" and alleged a conspiracy to create a rift in the alliance, Tagore responded with a pointed one-line post on X: ""How is it that seeking, in a spirit of friendship, a role (a share) in work to serve the people could be termed as conspiracy?""The post signalled that at least a section of the Congress was unwilling to back down, despite the DMK leadership’s categorical stance.Stalin, however, left little room for ambiguity. While reiterating that the Congress–DMK alliance was ""in harmony"" and free of confusion, he firmly ruled out sharing power with allies. ""It will not work in Tamil Nadu; they know it too. Rahul Gandhi is not worried either,"" he said, asserting DMK dominance while avoiding a direct confrontation with the Congress high command.The DMK has since doubled down on that position. Senior party leader and state forests minister RS Rajakannappan said bluntly that the DMK did not run on the strength of alliances. Invoking history, he asked whether former CM Kalaignar Karunanidhi had ever shared power despite winning over 100 seats, adding that a future DMK government under Stalin would follow only the ""Dravida model"".Within the Congress, the messaging remains mixed. While Tagore and a few others have argued that the question of whether Tamil Nadu should have a single-party or coalition government should be left to the people, the state leadership has opted for caution. Selvaperunthagai has maintained that there was ""no opportunity"" for a crack in the alliance and that all views would eventually be discussed by the AICC leadership and the chief minister.","Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) president K Selvaperunthagai publicly rebuked party MP Manickam Tagore for raising the issue of power sharing with the ruling DMK.

A two-time legislator, he clarified earlier that his resignation was not intended as a departure from politics and said he had not received any offer from other political parties.The development comes as the Congress prepares for the Assam Assembly elections, expected to be held in March–April, where it is likely to contest in alliance with other opposition parties.In the 126-member Assembly, the BJP currently holds 64 seats, with allies AGP, UPPL and BPF holding nine, seven and three seats respectively.

Police believe the deaths happened late Saturday night. A note was also discovered inside, though officials did not share what it said.

The statement read, “We are completely heartbroken. No words do the situation justice. She was so beyond loved, and she will always be a part of the UXC family. ”The news has deeply affected the cheer community and people who knew the family. What was meant to be a joyful weekend quickly turned into sorrow. Police say the investigation remains active as they continue to confirm details and timeline.

Erika Kirk ARRESTED Trying To Flee To Israel Amid FBI Investigation | Tyler Robinson Case COLLAPSES

Candace Owens discusses unverified grooming screenshots as false arrest rumor about Erika Kirk spreads online





Erika Kirk has not been arrested and she is not under investigation. Currently, there is no public record in the United States linking her to any criminal case tied to the viral “grooming” claim. In the past few days, social media posts and a YouTube video claimed that Erika Kirk was arrested while trying to flee to Israel. The claim also linked her name to alleged “grooming” messages from 2014 involving a 15 year old. The story spread quickly after conservative commentator Candace Owens spoke about old screenshots on her show. But as of now, there is no official proof to support these claims.Erika Kirk, widow of Charlie Kirk, has not been charged, questioned, or arrested in connection with any such allegation. There are also no court filings, police statements, or federal records confirming an arrest.The grooming claim first appeared through screenshots shared on social platform X. The posts suggested that Erika Kirk exchanged messages in 2014 with an account described online as youth coded. However, the screenshots were never verified. The person behind that account has not publicly accused Erika Kirk of wrongdoing.Later, Candace Owens discussed the screenshots on her show on YouTube. She did not present court documents or law enforcement proof. After that episode aired, a YouTube channel called Statecraft posted a video claiming Erika Kirk had been arrested while attempting to leave the country for Israel. The video suggested this was connected to both the grooming allegation and the case involving Charlie Kirk’s death.There is no evidence to support that claim. According to publicly available court records in Utah, the man accused in the death of Charlie Kirk, Tyler Robinson, is facing trial in Provo, Utah. That case is separate and does not name Erika Kirk as a suspect or person of interest. Major US media outlets have not reported any arrest or investigation involving her.As of now, no US law enforcement agency has announced charges against Erika Kirk. No arrest record exists in federal or state databases. The claim that she was detained while fleeing to Israel appears to be false. In short, viral posts connected her name to serious allegations. But there is no confirmed proof, no police case, and no verified arrest tied to Erika Kirk.","Erika Kirk, widow of Charlie Kirk, has not been charged, questioned, or arrested in connection with any such allegation.

Mumbai: Metro Collapse Crackdown, Cheating Case, Demolition Drive & More





MUMBAI: Sahar police arrested two cab drivers for allegedly cheating a Wadala couple of 1,000 Thai baht (about Rs 3,300) after they landed at Mumbai International Airport from Thailand on Feb 8 and hired a cab to go home.The accused, Imtiyaz Ahmad (34) and Riyasat Ali Khan (48), were arrested after an FIR was registered the next day. Police said they are checking how many other passengers may have been similarly duped.According to police, the couple -- Darshan Sawant (29), a fitness trainer, and his wife Monica -- was approached outside the terminal by a man who offered a cab to Wadala Fire Station in Antop Hill and quoted Rs 550, later agreeing to Rs 400. Khan allegedly made the couple sit in a taxi driven by Ahmad and rode along.After the taxi moved a short distance, he asked the driver to stop and demanded Rs 400 immediately, claiming he had to maintain accounts for multiple cars.The complainant, Darshan Sawant (29), said they did not have Indian currency and offered to pay via Google Pay, but Khan insisted on cash. When the couple said they had Thai currency, Khan allegedly said it would do and asked for 200 Thai baht, promising to return Rs 200.Police said Sawant's wife had 1,100 Thai baht in hand, but Khan took the money and, in a quick gesture, allegedly pocketed 1,000 Thai baht, paid the driver Rs 400, and left.After reaching home, the couple noticed the missing currency and filed a complaint the next day. Police said the taxis were seized, and an application has been made to the RTO to cancel the drivers' licences and permits.Last month, two other cab drivers were arrested for allegedly taking $200 from a US national for a 400-metre ride; police also initiated permit and licence cancellations in that case.","Two cab drivers arrested for allegedly cheating a couple of 1,000 Thai baht (about Rs 3,300) The couple landed at Mumbai International Airport from Thailand on Feb 8 and hired a cab to go home.

KOLKATA: The BLO, arrested on Friday for abducting a Baduria resident, on Saturday confessed to murdering him.

Mondal, a primary school teacher, and Ali, a resident of Papila village in the Basirhat police district, reportedly shared a cordial relationship until recently.Mondal's associate, Sagar Gayen, has also been arrested.In the evening of Feb 9, Ali left home after he received a call from an alleged assistant electoral registration officer, who apparently asked him to take photocopies of his mother's Aadhaar and voter ID cards to Lalkuthi.

KOLKATA: CM Mamata Banerjee on Saturday invoked Rabindranath Tagore 's ‘Ananta Prem' (Unending Love) to pen a love-for-the-people Happy Valentine's Day message on X, her first since her debut on the social platform in May 2014.Banerjee's ""May love live long"" post comes against the backdrop of several right-wing groups publicly opposing — and even threatening — those celebrating the day.Quoting Tagore's original 1890 Bengali verses, the CM wrote: ""I seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times. In life after life, age after age, forever."" She added: ""Valentine's Day is a celebration of love in all its forms and manifestations, in its widest and noblest sense; love that transcends caste, creed, class and religion. It is this spirit of love that has guided my journey in public service. A love for the people strong enough to withstand storms, patient enough to listen, and bold enough to fight for justice and dignity. Happy Valentine's Day!"" She concluded by saying, ""May love live long.""The post clocked 3,58,000 views in two hours. TMC seniors linked the message to a counter-narrative against the ""politics of hate"" that the CM has frequently criticised.Bengal BJP president Samik Bhattacharya was cautious in his response. ""I cannot comment on what others have said. But we will replace swords with pens and bombs with books. Look at the number of Muslims who were killed in West Bengal. Compare that with Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh or Gujarat.""However, CPM state secretary Md Salim said: ""We fail to understand whom she was addressing — the people or the country. After so much bloodbath, terror, killings and rapes, someone is thinking of returning to the fold of love and affection. Even if the feeling is belated, it is welcome.""‘Ananta Prem' is not only a Bengali favorite but is cherished worldwide. Several writers have noted that its English translation was among Audrey Hepburn's favorites. It is said that Hepburn loved the poem so much that during her funeral in 1993, her ‘Roman Holiday' co-star Gregory Peck recited these English verses.The closest reference in the past to Banerjee broaching this issue was during a Lok Sabha rally in Diamond Harbour ahead of the 2019 polls. At that time, the CM lashed out against ""anti-Romeo squads"" in BJP-governed states, particularly Uttar Pradesh. She dubbed it ""dangerous"".TMC, in a one-minute video on X, highlighted Banerjee's affection across all age groups in Bengal and stressed that love was not always about roses but also about standing by people during hard times and in grief, which the CM always did.",West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee invoked Rabindranath Tagore's ‘Ananta Prem' (Unending Love) to pen a love-for-the-people Happy Valentine's Day message on X.

Claims And Counter-Claims After Protest Escalates

Police Register Two FIRs, Invoke Assault Charges

(With agency inputs)





NEW DELHI: A woman YouTuber alleged on Saturday that she was assaulted and that an attempt was made to forcibly take her away during a protest at Delhi University’s North Campus a day earlier. However, a student group denied the allegations, claiming that its members were targeted instead.The YouTuber stated that she had gone to cover a protest demanding the implementation of new UGC regulations and was attacked after being asked her name.""I had gone to cover the protest, as I regularly do. Before I could even take out my mic, a person behind me tried to instigate me by repeatedly taking my name. When I asked him what the issue was, he asked for my name and caste. I told him my name and asked what had happened. After that, things escalated,"" the YouTuber said.""The entire crowd came towards me and attacked me. This is clear in the video. About 500 people attacked me. They just have fake narrations and fake allegations. The girls around me whispered rape threats in my ears just because I am a Brahmin; ""aaj tu chal, tera nanga parade niklega,"" is what they said. The men around me were saying that they would teach me a lesson.The girls had held me by the arms and neck. This is an attempt to murder. I had fallen unconscious, but the Police did nothing, "" she told ANI.YouTuber alleged that the reason the mob targeted her for her caste and that she was now registered an FIR in the case.""A boy there was signalling to others to take me away. Did they want to kidnap me? My clothes were being torn. I was being improperly touched. They were goons, they cannot be students. I was attacked due to my caste. Nobody supported me, only a few Law Faculties showed humanity, and I came out with their help as well as with that of a few women Police personnel. FIR has been registered, I trust the law .The incident occurred for about half an hour. There was mob lynching there, I escaped somehow is a big deal for me."" she claimed.""There was also a car with its gate open, and gestures were being made suggesting I be taken inside. I have filed a complaint with the police,"" she added.Meanwhile, Delhi University vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh described the incident as a matter of concern and said maintaining social harmony was everyone’s responsibility.The All India Students' Association (AISA) said in a statement that the protest over the UGC regulations was peaceful and that its activists intervened after the YouTuber allegedly created a disruption and confronted a journalist at the site.It termed the allegations ""false and motivated"" and said two of its members were later threatened and faced abuse at the police station when they went to file a complaint.The student outfit also claimed that videos circulating online do not show the full sequence of events. Multiple videos of the incident have been shared on social media with each side claiming that the onus lies with the other side.Delhi Police said two FIRs have been registered based on complaints filed by the YouTuber and a woman student affiliated with AISA.The Delhi University VC posted on X, requesting all teachers and students to maintain harmony among themselves. ""Do not engage in any activity that increases mutual discord and harms the image of the nation and the university,"" he said.Singh said students from all states of India and all communities study in the university. ""Social harmony is the greatest thing, and maintaining it is the duty of all of us,"" he wrote on X.""I have spoken with several student groups and teacher groups today and have also spoken with the police administration to ensure that no such incident occurs in the future that harms harmony. The new rules of the UGC that have come are currently under consideration in the Hon'ble Supreme Court.""I appeal to all teachers and students of the university to maintain their trust in the Government of India and await the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court,"" the VC said.Chaos marked a protest called by Left-backed student unions at Delhi University on Friday evening. The unrest followed a separate protest organised by the All India Forum for Equity to observe ‘All India Vanchit Adhikar Divas’ at the Arts Faculty, which allegedly witnessed scenes of violence. The students were demanding that the University Grants Commission (UGC) Regulations address and eliminate caste discrimination on campuses across India.A face-off between two student groups triggered claims and counter-claims, with each side accusing the other of violence and intimidation. According to the Left-backed student union AISA, some students were allegedly threatened and subjected to casteist abuse and slurs by a rival group.AISA activists further claimed that when they went to a local police station to register an FIR against the alleged attackers, members of the rival group ABVP — affiliated with the BJP — attacked them.In its statement the AISA said, ""Delhi Police repeatedly failed to disperse the attacking mob and even if they moved away this mob kept coming back. While the lawyer of the students inside was not allowed to enter the police station, the people against whom the complaint was being made entered and with them some goons even entered the station.""""The mob at this time became even more agitated and tried to surround those who had come in solidarity against the mob attack in order to attack them. Instead of removing the violent crowd, the police stood by and watched as the mob raised slogans like ""Desh ke gaddaron ko, goli maro salon ko"" (Shoot the traitors of the country), ""Brahmanwad Zindabad"" (Long live Brahmanism) and other violent gestures aimed particularly women comrades,"" AISA alleged in its statement.Countering these allegations, ABVP alleged that a female journalist, associated with a YouTube channel was allegedly assaulted by Left backed student activists. ABVP said that the incident exposes the violent character of Left-affiliated student organisations, which otherwise claim to champion freedom of expression across universities in the country.Meanwhile, a senior police officer said that FIRs have been filed in the case, and they have begun an inquiry.""Two FIRs have been registered, including one where the complainant is a female YouTuber and another, a female student from AISA. Both the FIRs have been registered under Sections 74 (assault or criminal force against a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 115(2) (voluntarily causing hurt), 126(2) (wrongful restraint) and 3(5) (common intention) of the BNS. Further action will be taken accordingly,"" the officer said.","A woman YouTuber claims she was assaulted and that an attempt was made to forcibly take her away during a protest at Delhi University’s North Campus.

DEHRADUN: In a major breakthrough in the probe into the daylight murder of 54-year-old Jharkhand gangster Vikram Sharma in Dehradun on Friday morning, Uttarakhand police on Saturday claimed to have unravelled the conspiracy and identified all three assailants.A senior officer at the police headquarters (PHQ), monitoring the investigation, told TOI that Sharma was ""killed on the directions of gangster Akhilesh Singh"", who is currently lodged in Dumka Central Jail in Jharkhand. Sharma had allegedly mentored Singh in the past, helping him establish himself in the criminal network.""It emerged during the probe that there was a dispute between the two over the sharing of extortion money. Since Singh is in jail, Sharma allegedly siphoned off a larger share, which enraged him.

On Friday, he succeeded,"" said the officer, requesting anonymity.Sharma, who was named in more than 50 criminal cases, including the 2007 murder of Sreeleathers co-owner Ashish Dey in Jamshedpur, was out on bail.He had been living in a rented apartment in Dehradun for over a year and regularly visited a gym inside a shopping complex on Rajpur Road. He was shot dead by three unidentified assailants on Friday morning after stepping out of the gym.The officer said police have identified all three accused and traced the route they took to flee the scene. ""After escaping on a motorbike, they reached Haridwar and stayed in a hotel for a few hours before boarding a train to leave the state. They have been identified and will be arrested soon. The investigation also revealed that Sharma was shot in the head from behind at point-blank range, indicating the attackers were professional and intended to leave no chance of survival,"" he added.When contacted, Uttarakhand DGP Deepam Seth declined to share further details, citing the ongoing investigation. ""However, we can confirm that the motive behind the murder has been established and the shooters, who are from Jharkhand, have been identified. Uttarakhand STF teams are coordinating with their counterparts in Jharkhand to arrest the accused at the earliest,"" Seth said.","Jharkhand gangster Vikram Sharma, 54, was shot dead in Dehradun on Friday.

VELLORE: Seven people sustained serious injuries after a 60-foot temple chariot toppled during the annual Mayana Kollai festival held on the banks of the Palar River in Vellore district.The injured have been admitted to the Government Medical College Hospital in Adukkamparai, according to news agency PTI.The incident took place around midnight when the chariot from Kazhinjur near Katpadi was being pulled from the riverbed onto the road after the ritual procession.The chariot reportedly lost balance and tilted sideways, trapping around 10 people. The police and members of the public immediately came to the rescue and helped the trapped individuals, and rushed the seriously injured to the government hospital.District Collector Subbulakshmi, Superintendent of Police Sivaraman, and Revenue Divisional Officer Senthil Kumar visited the spot and conducted an inspection. The Collector later met the injured persons at the hospital and enquired about their condition. Orders have been issued to conduct an inquiry into the accident, and festival organisers have been instructed to ensure that such incidents do not recur.The Mayana Kollai festival is one of the prominent annual events in the Vellore district. It was held on the Palar riverbank on Sunday evening. As part of the celebrations, deities from 10 villages were decorated, placed on temple chariots, and taken in procession to the riverbed where devotees performed traditional rituals and offerings.Following the accident, villagers from Kazhinjur retrieved only the idol from the tilted chariot and took it back to their village.According to government regulations, temple chariots should not exceed 12 feet in height. However, during the Mayana Kollai festival, chariots from Virudhambattu, Kazhinjur, and Mottur are reportedly around 60 feet tall.Notably, a similar incident occurred in 2023 when a chariot from Mottur village fell into the Palar riverbed during the festival.","The Mayana Kollai festival is one of the prominent annual events in the Vellore district.

Huge Crisis In US: Shutdown Hits DHS Amid Immigration Ops; Dems Block Funding Over ICE Actions





An Indian-origin man accused of multiple offences, including the sexual assault of a minor, has been detained by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).Vodela Yashaswi Kottapalli faces charges in New Jersey for the sexual assault of a child under 13 years of age, shoplifting and public disorderIn a post on X, ICE said, “Vodela Yashaswi Kottapalli, a criminal illegal alien from India, has pending charges for sexual assault and larceny in New Jersey. We'll keep him in custody pending removal proceedings. ”The agency said he remains in custody pending removal proceedings.The enforcement action comes as ICE has intensified action against undocumented migrants during the second term of Donald Trump, with the agency publicly sharing details of arrests and detentions involving foreign nationals accused of crimes.In December, ICE had also released details of another case involving an Indian truck driver linked to a fatal motorway crash in Oregon that killed two people. Authorities said the driver entered the United States illegally through Arizona in November 2022 and later received work authorisation and a commercial driving licence from California state authorities.That case followed several similar crashes involving Indian nationals driving heavy goods vehicles in the US. In recent months, US authorities have highlighted at least three other fatal accidents in Florida and California involving undocumented Indian lorry drivers.","Vodela Yashaswi Kottapalli faces charges in New Jersey for the sexual assault of a child under 13 years of age, shoplifting and public disorder.

‘It just went off’: Why father who shot British daughter won’t face jail—what's Trump link?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/it-just-went-off-why-father-who-shot-british-daughter-wont-face-jailwhats-trump-link/articleshow/128449028.cms,"(Image credits: X @CollinRugg)





After a man shot his British daughter at his home in Texas after he pointed a gun at her as a prank and pulled the trigger, he will not be facing prison.Lucy Harrison, 23, from Warrington in Cheshire, was killed while on holiday at her father Kris Harrison’s house in Prosper, near Dallas, on 10 January 2025. A coroner has now ruled she was unlawfully killed, reported BBC.She was in a bedroom when his Glock semi-automatic handgun discharged, shooting her through the chest. Evidence at the inquest showed the magazine was not in the gun but a bullet remained in the chamber. The weapon had been stored in a locked box in a bedside cabinet.Senior Cheshire coroner Jacqueline Devonish found that, on the balance of probabilities, Kris Harrison had been teasing his daughter by pointing the gun at her without checking it was unloaded.“To shoot her through the chest whilst she was standing would have required him to have been pointing the gun at his daughter, without checking for bullets, and pulling the trigger,” she said.“I accept he was a teaser, and on the balance of probabilities, this is what he was doing. I accept he did not realize the gun was loaded,” she added.Video from a police body-worn camera shown at the inquest captured Kris Harrison explaining what happened.He told an officer, “She said ‘you’ve got a gun?’ I said yes, I got it out and it just went off as she stood there.”In the background, Lucy’s boyfriend Sam Littler, who had travelled with her on the holiday, could be seen holding his head in distress. He had earlier told the hearing she had become upset after she and her father argued about Donald Trump, who was due to be inaugurated as US president later that month.Kris Harrison, who did not attend the hearing, said in a written statement that he and his daughter had been watching a television news item about gun crime when she asked to see the weapon.Littler disputed this, telling the court she disliked guns and would not have asked to see one. In her summary of his evidence, the coroner said, “She would never have asked to see the gun. She would not be laughing and giggling if discussing guns. There was nothing on television at the time regarding guns, contrary to what Kris stated in his statement.”The inquest also heard that Kris Harrison had previously been in rehabilitation for alcohol addiction and later admitted secretly drinking cartons of white wine on the day of the shooting. Littler said Lucy had told him she believed her father had been drinking, although it was not obvious to others, and that she had been worried about guns being kept around her younger siblings.Texas police investigated the shooting as possible manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide, but a grand jury declined to bring charges and the death was ruled an accident in the United States.Devonish recorded a conclusion of unlawful killing in the UK inquest.After the hearing, Lucy’s mother Jane Coates criticised the Prosper Police Department’s handling of the investigation and said: “Today's outcome has finally given Lucy her voice back after what has been an unrelenting year of deep shock, grief and fight - fight with quiet focus and steely determination to allow Lucy to speak her truth with the only voice she has now.”","Lucy Harrison, 23, was killed while on holiday at her father Kris Harrison’s house in Prosper, near Dallas, on 10 January 2025.

Australia won't repatriate 34 women and children from Syria,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/australia-wont-repatriate-34-women-and-children-from-syria/articleshow/128448220.cms,"Family members of suspected Islamic State militants who are Australian nationals board a van heading to the airport in Damascus during the first repatriation operation of the year, at Roj Camp in eastern Syria (AP photo)





MELBOURNE: The Australian government will not repatriate from Syria a group of 34 women and children with alleged ties to the Islamic State group, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Tuesday.The women and children from 11 families were supposed to fly from the Syrian capital Damascus to Australia but Syrian authorities on Monday turned them back to Roj camp in northeast Syria because of procedural problems, officials said.Only two groups of Australians have been repatriated with government help from Syrian camps since the fall of the Islamic State group in 2019. Other Australians have also returned without government assistance.Albanese would not comment on a report that the latest women and children had Australian passports.""We're providing absolutely no support and we are not repatriating people,"" Albanese told Australian Broadcasting Corp. in Melbourne.""We have no sympathy, frankly, for people who traveled overseas in order to participate in what was an attempt to establish a caliphate to undermine, destroy, our way of life. And so, as my mother would say, 'You make your bed, you lie in it,'"" Albanese added.Albanese noted that the child welfare-focused international charity Save the Children had failed to establish in Australia's courts that the Australian government had a responsibility to repatriate citizens from Syrian camps.After the federal court ruled in the government's favor in 2024, Save the Children Australia chief executive Mat Tinkler argued the government had a moral, if not legal, obligation to repatriate families.Albanese said if the latest group made their way to Australia without government help, they could be charged.It was an offense under Australian law to travel to the former Islamic State stronghold of al-Raqqa province without a legitimate reason from 2014 to 2017. The maximum penalty was 10 years in prison.""It's unfortunate that children are impacted by this as well, but we are not providing any support. And if anyone does manage to find their way back to Australia, then they'll face the full force of the law, if any laws have been broken,"" Albanese added.The last group of Australians to be repatriated from Syrian camps arrived in Sydney in October 2022.They were four mothers, former partners of Islamic State supporters, and 13 children.Australian officials had assessed the group as the most vulnerable among 60 Australian women and children held in Roj camp, the government said at the time.Eight offspring of two slain Australian Islamic State fighters were repatriated from Syria in 2019 by the conservative government that preceded Albanese's center-left Labor Party administration.The issue of Islamic State supporters resurfaced in Australia after the killings of 15 people at a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach on Dec. 14. The attackers were allegedly inspired by IS.",The women and children from 11 families were supposed to fly from the Syrian capital Damascus to Australia.

Trump's Most Shocking New Epstein Secret Out; Disturbing Reveal On Underage Girls | DOJ Kills Link





US President Donald Trump has once again denied any involvement with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, saying he has been “totally exonerated” and has “nothing to hide.”Addressing reporters, Trump said investigations had cleared him of wrongdoing. “I have nothing to hide. I've been exonerated. I have nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein,” he said, adding that Democrats “went in hoping that they'd find it and found just the opposite. ”Trump also claimed that Epstein had opposed his political ambitions. “Jeffrey Epstein was fighting that I don't get elected with some author, a sleazebag, by the way,” he claimed.During the interaction, Trump further suggested that other political figures, including former president Bill Clinton, had been drawn into scrutiny related to Epstein. Taking jabs at the Democrats, he added, ""it's really interesting because they've been pulled in. Think of it. They've been pulled in. Clinton and many other Democrats have been pulled in.""He also hit back at Hillary Clinton's claims that, ""she and her husband are getting pulled into the Epstein matter to divert attention from [Trump]"" and that his ""administration has something to hide"". In response to reporter's questions on the accusations, Trump said, ""No, no.They're getting pulled and that's their problem. I don't know. They're going to have to see what happens. But I watched her in Munich, and she seriously has Trump derangement syndrome. ""Epstein died in 2019 in federal custody while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. His links to prominent figures across politics, business and entertainment have remained a subject of public attention and ongoing scrutiny.This comes after a batch of released Justice Department files referenced past contact between Donald Trump and investigators probing Jeffrey Epstein. According to a 2019 FBI interview summary, former Palm Beach police chief Michael Reiter claims Trump called during the mid-2000s investigation and expressed relief authorities were taking action, stating that people had long known about Epstein’s conduct. The document also records Trump as saying he had banned Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago club and left a gathering after noticing teenagers present. Trump has previously said he cut ties with Epstein more than 20 years ago.The release of the Epstein files led to investigators reviewing allegations and tips involving several prominent figures, including Trump, but officials said they did not find credible information warranting further investigation into sexual misconduct claims against him. The records also confirm prosecutors issued a subpoena to Mar-a-Lago in 2021 during their case against Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell , who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.","President Donald Trump has denied any involvement with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

'Steep Consequences': Trump Warns Iran Of Action Despite First Round Of Nuclear Talks





United States president Donald Trump on Monday said he would be involved “indirectly” in talks with Iran on its nuclear programme scheduled for Tuesday in Geneva and urged Tehran to be reasonable.He also referred to the June 2025 B-2 bomber strike and said he believed Iran wanted to reach an agreement.""So I will be involved in those talks, indirectly, and they will be very important, let’s see what can happen. Iran is a very tough negotiator, I would say they're bad negotiators because we could’ve had a deal instead of sending the B2s into knockout, their nuclear potential, and we had to send the B2s. I hope they’re gonna be more reasonable, they wanna make a deal,"" Trump said to reporters.He said Tehran now appeared motivated to negotiate.""I think they wanna make a deal. I don’t think they want the consequences of not making a deal,"" Trump said.The United States and Iran are expected to hold the next round of nuclear talks on Tuesday (local time) in Geneva, Switzerland, CNN reported.US special envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are expected to attend the meetings.Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araqchi met the UN nuclear watchdog chief on Monday and said in a post on X that he was in Geneva to “achieve a fair and equitable deal.”The International Atomic Energy Agency has for months urged Iran to account for its stockpile of 440 kg of highly enriched uranium after Israeli-US strikes and to allow full inspections to resume, including at Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan, which were bombed in June last year.Iran has repeatedly warned it could close the Strait of Hormuz in response to any attack, a move that would disrupt about one-fifth of global oil flows and push crude prices higher.Meanwhile, Iran’s deputy foreign minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi has said Tehran would consider compromises on its uranium stockpile if Washington lifted sanctions that have affected the country’s economy, as cited by the BBC.Iran and the United States held previous rounds of nuclear talks in April 2025 in Muscat and Rome.However, on June 21–22, 2025, the United States carried out strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan under “Operation Midnight Hammer,” which Iran condemned as a violation of international law and the UN Charter.",U.S. president Donald Trump said he would be involved “indirectly’ in talks with Iran on its nuclear programme scheduled for Tuesday in Geneva.

The shooting occurred at the Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket during a boys’ high school hockey game.

Police say three people, including the suspected gunman, were killed. The suspect died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Three additional victims were taken to hospital and remain in critical condition.

The suspect was identified as a father who may have been wearing women’s clothing at the time of the attack, according to reporting by NBC 10's Dan Jaehnig.

Authorities believe the incident was targeted and linked to a family dispute.

Investigators are reviewing video footage from inside the arena and interviewing witnesses. Unverified social media clips appear to show players diving for cover as multiple shots are heard.

Schools involved in the game confirmed that students on the ice were safe. The shooting is understood to have involved spectators.

Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee said he was monitoring the situation and in contact with local law enforcement. The FBI’s Boston office confirmed it was ready to assist and said there was no ongoing threat.

Mayor Don Grebien called the incident “very tragic”, saying: “These are high school kids… a fun time, and it turned into this.”





Three people are dead after a gunman opened fire during a youth hockey game in Rhode Island, turning what should have been a routine high school fixture into a scene of panic and devastation. The shooting took place on Monday evening at an ice rink in Pawtucket, just north of Providence, with families and students gathered in the stands.Police say the suspected gunman was a father who may have been dressed in women’s clothing. According to local reports, he intentionally targeted family members attending the game. Authorities believe the violence stemmed from a domestic dispute.Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves described the incident as “a targeted event” that “may be a family dispute”. She confirmed that three people, including the suspect, died. The gunman is believed to have shot himself. Three others remain in hospital in critical condition.Inside the arena, witnesses described scenes of chaos as shots rang out shortly after the start of the first period. Players reportedly fled the ice in full kit, while spectators ducked for cover and rushed towards exits. Outside, tearful families embraced as police sealed off surrounding roads and helicopters circled overhead.The attack comes less than two months after a separate gun tragedy in the state, but officials have said the two incidents are not connected.","Police say three people, including the suspected gunman, were killed.

Los Angeles flash flood warning: What residents need to know about upcoming storms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/los-angeles-flash-flood-warning-what-residents-need-to-know-about-upcoming-storms/articleshow/128438563.cms,"What’s happening now

Why the flood threat is serious

What flash flood warnings mean

Risk factors across Los Angeles

Burn scar areas — Hillsides affected by wildfire lack vegetation to absorb water, increasing the chance of debris flows and mudslides.

Urban zones — Heavy rain can quickly overwhelm storm drains and cause water to pool on streets and freeways.

— Heavy rain can quickly overwhelm storm drains and cause water to pool on streets and freeways. Mountain and canyon regions — Rapid runoff can elevate streams and cause hazardous conditions.

Official advice





Los Angeles and much of Southern California are facing flash flood risks as a series of strong storms moves through the region, bringing heavy rain, thunderstorms and hazardous conditions. Officials and forecasters warn residents to stay alert and prepared because flash floods can develop quickly and with little warning.A powerful weather system has brought intense rainfall to Southern California, including Los Angeles County. The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued flash flood warnings and watches for parts of the county as rainstorms dump significant moisture over the area.Heavy rain has already triggered warnings for places including the Santa Monica Mountains and burn scar zones like the Palisades and Franklin areas, where recent wildfires have left the ground more prone to dangerous debris flows and rapid runoff.Forecasters say this weather pattern is part of a larger system that could bring several days of precipitation, with the heaviest rainfall expected early in the week. Coastal and valley regions may see between 1 to 3 inches of rain, while mountain areas could receive between 2 to 5 inches or more.Storms may also be accompanied by strong winds and isolated thunderstorms. In some conditions, even weak tornado activity cannot be ruled out as part of the larger threat.A flash flood warning means flooding is imminent or already happening. Water can rise rapidly along streams, in urban streets, and in poorly drained areas. A flood watch, on the other hand, means conditions are favourable for flooding.Because flash floods can occur within minutes of heavy rain, authorities urge people not to drive through flooded roads and to seek higher ground if necessary.Certain areas are especially vulnerable:Authorities recommend monitoring local weather bulletins, signing up for emergency alerts, and preparing for possible evacuations in vulnerable locations. Roads may become dangerous, and officials warn that flash flooding can strike fast and without much notice.Staying informed through trusted weather services such as the NWS and local emergency management is essential during these conditions.",A powerful weather system has brought intense rainfall to Southern California.
