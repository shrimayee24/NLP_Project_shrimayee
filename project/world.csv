MUMBAI: In one of the biggest drug seizures in the country this year, the Anti-Narcotics Cell and Crime Branch of the Mira-Bhayandar, Vasai-Virar police have busted a massive cartel operating through a chemical manufacturing factory in Telangana, seizing mephedrone (MD) worth an estimated Rs 12,000 crore.Mephedrone, also called “meow meow,” “meph,” “m-cat,” and “miaow,” is a synthetic stimulant belonging to the amphetamine group of drugs, which includes speed and ecstasy. According to sources, this is among the largest narcotics seizures in recent years.The probe began with the arrest of a 12 person including a foreign national and seizure of 100 grams of MD along with Rs 25 lakh in cash. Further interrogation revealed links to an interstate network engaged in large-scale production and supply of mephedrone. The investigation eventually led officers to Telangana, where the cartel was using a chemical factory as a cover for drug manufacturing.“In a bid to get to the roots of the factory, we infiltrated our men in the gang. After weeks of risky efforts, we were able to bust the cartel,” a senior officer said.The factory, located in the Cherlapally industrial area near Hyderabad and operating under the name Waghdevi Labs, appeared legitimate from the outside but was allegedly producing narcotics on a large scale.During the raid, police seized sophisticated chemical equipment, drug production units, and a massive cache of raw materials, including nearly 32,000 litres of precursor chemicals.The factory’s owner and chemical expert, Srinivas Valotty, along with associate Tanaji Pate, were taken into custody. In total, 12 persons have been arrested so far, including the foreign national caught in the initial operation.Police described the bust as a major blow to the narcotics supply chain across Maharashtra and other states. The factory has been sealed, and further raids are being conducted to trace the cartel’s wider distribution network.Commissioner of MBVV Niket Kaushik confirmed the drug seizure and said their investigation has led them to drug cartel to other states.","Mephedrone is a synthetic stimulant belonging to the amphetamine group of drugs, which includes speed and ecstasy.

He ordered that all the people suffering with unexplained illness should be admitted to hospital.Naidu conducted a review meeting on death of around 20 people in Turakapalem village in the past two months with unknown disease. He said health camps should be conducted in the village on Saturday and Sunday and medical tests should be conducted to all and prepare health profile of everyone.He advised the health officials to take the assistance of AIIMS Mangalagiri and if necessary international medical experts. He directed the officials to supply protected drinking water in the village. He made it clear no new case should be reported hereafter.""Officials should be vigilant 24X7 as there is a high possibility for the spread of the suspected bacterial disease through drinking water, food items, and through air.Meanwhile, the state govt constituted a high-level committee, led by Director of Secondary Health (DSH) Dr A Siri, to identify the officials responsible for failing to apprise higher authorities in time about the sudden spike in deaths in Turakapalem village.The committee will also make recommendations on measures to ensure that health department officials are immediately informed in case of a large number of deaths due to any illness in any region of the state in the future. This was announced by Health Minister Y Satya Kumar Yadav on Friday during his visit to Turakapalem village.Stating that stern action would be taken against all those officials for their inaction in reporting the deaths to the health authorities, Satya Kumar Yadav warned that no official will be spared and appropriate action will be taken against all the officials once the probe report is submitted by the high-level committee, which was ordered to complete in a week's time.Speaking to reporters, Satya Kumar Yadav said it is unfortunate on the part of the healthcare personnel working at the field level that they did not apprise the higher officials despite 23 people dying in the past two months. He said that the mean age of the deceased is 55, while around seven deceased were aged above 70 years.Dismissing media reports linking Melioidosis as the reason behind the deaths, the health minister said that the blood test reports have not confirmed the Melioidosis bacteria and that chemical and biological tests are also being done to determine the exact cause.The minister toured Turakapalem village, visiting the victims' households, enquiring about their health condition, and consoling the bereaved family members, besides taking a first-hand review of the medical services being provided to the villagers at the special medical camp set up in the village.Meanwhile, Guntur DMHO Dr Vijaya Lakshmi informed that the blood culture test results of the blood samples collected from individuals showing fever symptoms will arrive on Saturday.",Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Friday directed that health officials take a serious note on continuous deaths in Turakapalem of Guntur district.

""""I don't think we have anything to say sorry about at all. India has behaved with a great deal of maturity on all of this,"" Tharoor told ANI, noting that even past US administrations had ""encouraged"" New Delhi to buy Russian oil in order to ""stabilise global prices.""Tharoor's remarks came in response to US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who claimed that ""India is going to be at the table, and they're gonna say they're sorry and eventually strike a deal with US President Donald Trump.""Countering Lutnick's claim, Tharoor pointed out that larger economies were more deeply tied to Moscow than India.""China buys more Russian oil and gas than we do. Turkey buys more Russian oil and gas than we do. Europe doesn't buy oil and gas, but they buy other Russian items, so they're putting more billions of dollars into Russia's kitty than we do. It seems bizarre that we are alone being singled out for allegedly financing the Russian war effort when others are doing far more than we are,"" he said.Calling it a ""mistake in American policy,"" the Thiruvananthapuram MP said such criticism of India was ""not warranted or justified.""""I think Mr Lutnick has to understand that we are a sovereign nation, just as they are. They can take their own sovereign decisions, we will take our own sovereign decisions,"" he added.Lutnick on Friday took a cue from Trump’s hardline tariff stance warning India to ""stop buying Russian oil, stop being a part of BRICS, and support the United States and the dollar or face a 50% tariff"" even likening India’s position to Canada’s retreat after economic pressure.""In a month or two months, I think India is going to be at the table, and they're gonna say they're sorry, and they're going to try to make a deal with Donald Trump and it will be on Donald Trump's desk how he wants to deal with Modi, and we leave that to him. That's why he's the president,"" Lutnick said.He also labelled India as ""the vowel between Russia and China"" in BRICS, saying, ""If that's who you want to be, go, be it... ....and let's see how long this lasts.""Lutnick's remarks came after Trump himself softened his tone on his social media post, calling India-US ties ""very special"" and affirming his friendship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after the SCO summit in Tianjin.Trump said, ""I always will. I'll always be friends with (PM) Modi. He's a great Prime Minister. I'll always be friends, but I just don't like what he is doing at this particular moment.""""But India and the United States have a very special relationship. There is nothing to worry about. We just have moments on occasion,"" he added.Following Trump’s statement, PM Modi responded warmly on Saturday, saying he ""deeply appreciates and fully reciprocates President Trump's sentiments and positive assessment of our ties.""Tharoor also urged caution over PM Modi’s warm response to Trump’s remarks on India-US ties saying, ""The Prime Minister was very quick to respond, and the foreign minister has also underscored the importance of the basic relationship that is a comprehensive global strategic partnership, which is still there. And that message is an important message for us to give. I don't think we can just completely forget either the 50% tariffs or the insults that have accompanied it from both the President and his staff. ""The Congress MP further warned that Trump's ""mercurial temperament"" and the ""real consequences"" of punitive tariffs demanded caution.""One can't just forget and forgive so quickly because there are real consequences that Indians are facing on the ground and those consequences need to be overcome,"" he added.","Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said that India has ""nothing to say sorry about"" as it has acted with ""a great deal of maturity"" He also criticised the US for unfairly singling out New Delhi and pointing out that ""Europe is putting more billions of dollars into Russia's kitty than we do""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123749861,imgsize-39250,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

J&K police have not confirmed any numbers since the vandalism Friday afternoon.“No one has been formally arrested so far, but some people are being questioned,” PTI quoted a senior police officer as saying, adding that women allegedly involved will face legal action but minors will not be proceeded against.Authorities tightened security around the shrine, which houses a relic of Prophet Muhammad, after the plaque was vandalised and removed following Friday prayers. Police had checked phone videos and CCTV footage before picking up dozens. No fresh disturbances have been reported.NC said an open FIR was registered and accused the LG-led administration of heavy-handedness. “I’m deeply anguished to learn that nearly 30 people have been detained by police,” NC MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi said, calling the detentions “operational retribution” and warning against misrepresenting “an expression of collective hurt as anti-national”.He urged release of detainees and said the idea of India rests on respect for religious sentiment.NC president Farooq Abdullah called the installation of the Ashoka emblem a mistake. “There was no need to install the plaque. They put it up and people did not like it. When the Hazratbal shrine was constructed no board was placed there because it was dedicated to Allah and His Prophet,” he said. “We are peace-loving people and this shouldn’t have been done.”CM Omar Abdullah said Waqf Board should apologise, contending that the national emblem is for govt offices, not mosques.PDP, CPM and Peoples Conference demanded action against Waqf Board chairperson Darakhshan Andrabi, a BJP appointee, who had overseen the plaque’s placement Thursday as part of what she described as remodelling on Turkish lines.Opposition politicians called the plaque “provocative” and “blasphemous”, saying symbols are forbidden inside mosques. BJP said the defacement was an attempt to revive terrorism and separatism in J&K.BJP defended Andrabi’s role and alleged NC was exploiting the controversy. “This is an act of terrorism. Andrabi had every right to place the emblem. NC doesn’t like her and is using the emblem to create unrest in Kashmir Valley,” party spokesperson Altaf Thakur said.Andrabi demanded those who vandalised the plaque be booked under Public Safety Act.",National Conference (NC) put the figure at 30 and BJP’s Altaf Thakur said 26.

Pro-Khalistan terror outfits like Babbar Khalsa International and International Sikh Youth Federation are receiving financial support within Canada, according to the Canadian govt's official report 'Assessment of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risks', which acknowledges that the extremist groups are resorting to ""violent means to establish an independent state within Punjab, India"".The report, however, said that the monetary support for the pro-Khalistan groups has now shrunk and is confined to small pockets of supporters. ""These groups previously had an extensive fundraising network in Canada but now appear to consist of smaller pockets of individuals with allegiance to the cause,"" it noted.Khalistani violent extremist groups have also been known to use networks to solicit donations from diaspora communities to raise and move funds, including through non-profit organisations,"" the Canadian govt's report noted. The acknowledgment of the use of violent means is in contrast to the description of their activities as ""democratic freedoms"" earlier.The report lists BKI and ISYF, along with Hamas and Hezbollah, in the ""politically motivated violent extremism"" category who have been able to generate funds in Canada.These groups, it said, used diverse funding methods to sustain their operations, including the abuse of the money services businesses and banking sectors; use of cryptocurrencies; state financing; abuse of the charitable and NPO sector; and criminal activity.The report covers all violent groups on how they were able to sustain themselves by finding resources within Canada. Self-financing methods were observed in two prominent terrorist attacks in Canada conducted by lone actors radicalised by ideologically motivated violent extremism.It cited the 2020 incident of a 17-year-old male radicalised by the incel (involuntary celibacy) movement who killed a woman and injured another at a massage parlour in Toronto, using only a sword to conduct the attack. Another case cited was from 2021, in which four members of a Muslim family were killed when an individual drove a pickup truck onto a pedestrian crosswalk in London, Ontario. In 2024, the individual was sentenced to life imprisonment for first-degree murder and attempted murder amounting to terrorism.The report also mentions Canada's financial sector may be exposed to risks emanating from correspondent banking relationships with institutions known or suspected of servicing Hezbollah or Hamas.Cross-border networks and organised IMVE groups differ from lone actors in their financing, it noted. ""Organised groups often rely on online communities and cross-border networks to raise funds and have been observed to rely on a host of financing methods, including commercial activities, such as merchandise sales; hosting paid events, such as talks and concerts; crowdfunding; charging membership fees; and accepting donations,"" it said. ""Some groups have also been known to engage in drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, and theft to fund their operations,"" the report added.","Pro-Khalistan terror outfits like Babbar Khalsa International and International Sikh Youth Federation are receiving financial support within Canada.

A global spectacle in a quiet town



A family shattered



The mystery of the meal







Erin Patterson, the woman at the centre of the notorious ""mushroom murders"" case, was sentenced to life in prison by an Australian judge on Monday, with the possibility of parole after 33 years.The latest development in the mushroom murders case ended a saga that gripped audiences around the world.Patterson, 50, was convicted in July of murdering her estranged husband's parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and his aunt Heather Wilkinson, during a family lunch in 2023. She served them a beef Wellington laced with deadly death cap mushrooms, the world's most lethal fungus, at her home in rural Victoria.Heather’s husband, Pastor Ian Wilkinson, is the sole survivor in the case.The case caught the global attention. The trial held in Morwell transformed the courthouse into a media circus. Podcasters, documentary crews, and true-crime fanatics crowded the courtroom, while news outlets from different parts of the world covered each revelation. The crime became so infamous that it was simply branded the ""mushroom murders.""The motive for the killings remains elusive. Justice Christopher Beale, in handing down the sentence in Melbourne, said Patterson had shown no remorse for the deaths.""Your failure to exhibit any remorse pours salt into all the victims' wounds,"" he told the court. ""The gravity of your offending warrants the imposition of the maximum penalties for your crimes.""Patterson, wearing a paisley shirt with her hair tied back, remained impassive as the sentence was read. She will be 83 years old before becoming eligible for parole. Her lawyers had pleaded for a chance at release after 30 years, arguing her notoriety means she will spend much of her sentence in isolation. She has 28 days to appeal.The July jury verdict found Patterson guilty of three counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. Her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, who was invited to the fatal meal but pulled out at the last minute, later told the court he felt ""uncomfortable"" attending. The couple had been locked in a bitter dispute over child support at the time.The court heard harrowing victim impact statements. Pastor Wilkinson, the only survivor, said he now feels ""half alive"" without his wife.""The silence in our home is a daily reminder,"" he said. ""I continue to carry a heavy burden of grief over her untimely death.""Outside the courtroom on Monday, he thanked the community for its support. ""I'd like to encourage everybody to be kind to each other,"" he said. ""Please respect our privacy as we continue to grieve and heal.""Throughout the two-month trial, Patterson maintained the poisoning was accidental, claiming the mushrooms were mistakenly used in the dish. Death caps — which grow wild in parts of Victoria — are often confused with edible varieties and are said to have a sweet taste that masks their lethality.But for many observers, what remains most chilling is not the science of the poison, but the silence of the motive. More than a year after the beef Wellington lunch, the question of why still lingers.","Erin Patterson, 50, was convicted in July of murdering her estranged husband's parents.

US President Donald Trump unveiled the newly-renovated Rose Garden on Friday and introduced the Rose Garden Club, calling it the “hottest” place to be in Washington.“We have worked very hard to bring it to fruition and not an easy situation, but it’s something that I think we’re all going to enjoy for many, many years to come. It’s a tremendous place,” Trump said to the gathering invited to the dinner.The White House had not officially announced the new club before the event. Guests were served Rose Garden salad as a first course, followed by a choice of New York Strip steak, thyme roasted chicken, or a vegetarian pasta dish. Dessert was a fudge-filled cake.White House spokesman Davis Ingle said, as quoted by The New York Post, “The Rose Garden Club at the White House is the hottest place to be in Washington, or perhaps the world. The president looks forward to welcoming top business, political, and tech leaders for this dinner and the many dinners to come on the new, beautiful Rose Garden patio.”Trump said renovations to the garden were long overdue. “Every time we’d have a press conference, women in particular were sinking deep into the mud and at some point I said, you know, it’s time to make the change. We picked a great stone and we have a great speaker system.”The Rose Garden project, which began in April, is one of several renovations under Trump. He has redecorated the Oval Office and Cabinet Room with golden decor, erected two 100-foot flag poles on the North and South lawns, and is planning a self-funded $200 million ballroom by the East Wing.The new look, with its yellow umbrellas, recalled Trump’s private club at Mar-a-Lago, where he often hosts VIPs. In recent weeks, songs such as “Whiter Shade of Pale” by Procol Harum and “Are You Lonesome Tonight?” by Elvis have been heard outside the White House as the president tested the sound system.","US President Donald Trump unveiled the newly-renovated Rose Garden on Friday.

Women seeking to be independent targeted: KSCW chief





MYSURU: In the past five and a half years, on average, 13 married women have died in a month due to dowry harassment and at least eight women a day complained of harassment by husbands in a worrying trend of increasing marital violence in the state.According to data presented by women and child welfare minister Laxmi Hebbalkar during the recently concluded legislative session in response to a question by MLC Govindaraju, the state has reported as many as 1,677 cases of harassment by husbands and 70 dowry deaths in the first seven months of this year alone.From Jan 2020 to July 2025, Karnataka has registered 14,626 cases of harassment against women by their husbands and 834 deaths due to dowry harassment.The definition of domestic violence for this dataset presented by the govt includes harassment, beating, physical and mental torture and body-shaming and excludes instances of sexual harassment.A woman's rights activist said, ""Today, the entire society is attacking women over a handful of incidents involving women. In reality, this data presents the trauma suffered by women.""According to Karnataka State Commission for Women chairperson Nagalakshmi Choudhary, many factors are leading to harassment cases and dowry deaths in the state. ""Women are harassed or targeted over objecting to partner's extramarital affairs, and also for attempting to independently earn a living. Many times, ego clashes also result in harassment,"" she said.""Even today, many families want women to remain dependent on men. Any woman who challenges this faces harassment,"" Nagalakshmi said.""Many poor families opt for early marriages for their girls. Sadly, in 99% of cases, if a woman questions husband's extramarital relationship, his parents never support her,"" she said.Komala M, professor of human development and family studies at UoM, said if husband and wife start respecting each other and opt for adjustments instead of constant bickering, most incidents could be avoided. ""The violence in the family ultimately affects the children, "" she said, adding, ""Harassment is wrong whoever commits it.""","In the past five and a half years, on average, 13 married women have died in a month due to dowry harassment.

"Mumbai don-turned neta Gawli walks free after 17 years, wants to reunite with family",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/mumbai-don-turned-neta-gawli-walks-free-after-17-years-wants-to-reunite-with-family/articleshow/123684521.cms,"



NAGPUR: Notorious Mumbai don-turned-neta Arun Gawli also called ‘Daddy' stepped out of Nagpur Central Prison on Wednesday after Supreme Court granted him bail in the 2007 murder case of Sena corporator Kamlakar Jamsandekar. After serving over 17 years in a high-security cell, including nine-and-half years in Nagpur Central Jail, the 76-year-old gangster shared a poignant wish with a senior jailor to reconnect with his family and play with his grandchildren, a stark contrast to his fearsome reputation in Mumbai's criminal underbelly.Gawli confided to one of the senior prison officials, his voice heavy with regret, that he missed watching his children grow and now wanted to spend time grandchildren. The emotional confession revealed a softer side of a man, who once ruled Dagdi Chawl in Byculla, offering a glimpse into his longing to reclaim a life lost to incarceration.The release was steeped in drama with Nagpur Police and prison guards orchestrating a fortified security to ensure Gawli's safe exit. Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) personnel and various intelligence units were present to pick up concealed clues.Dodging a throng of media waiting at the jail gates, Gawli was whisked away to Nagpur airport under heavy escort, arriving three hours early for his Mumbai-bound flight.Intelligence sources cited ongoing threats from Dawood Ibrahim 's D-Company, a feud rooted in the violent gang wars of the Eighties and Nineties, as the reason for his cautious departure. Surveillance was ramped up with police videographing the scene.Gawli's conviction in 2012 for Jamsandekar's murder, under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), marked a significant blow to his empire. Sentenced to life, he challenged the Bombay High Court's 2019 ruling upholding his conviction. On August 28, the Supreme Court granted him bail, citing his age and the 17 years already served, pending his appeal.Inside Nagpur Central Jail, Gawli was a model prisoner, adhering to protocols and earning commendations for discipline. He was granted 14–15 paroles and furloughs without incident. ""We recalled seeing Gawli spending time with religious scriptures,"" said a senior prison official. In 2018, he grabbed headlines by taking an exam on Gandhian philosophy, scoring 74 out of 80 marks, earning a certificate and khadi clothes — a surprising twist for a man synonymous with Mumbai's underworld.Gawli's release sparked speculation about his next move. Once a formidable figure who transitioned from crime to politics, serving as an MLA from Chinchpokli (2004–2009) under his Akhil Bharatiya Sena, Gawli's legacy is a complex tapestry of power, crime, and redemption. As he returns to Mumbai, questions swirl about whether ‘Daddy' will revive his political ambitions or embrace the quiet family life he craves.With security concerns looming, particularly from D-Company, his homecoming is anything but ordinary. Mumbai watches closely as the aging don steps into an uncertain future, balancing personal dreams with a past that refuses to fade.","Arun Gawli, 76, was released from Nagpur Central Prison on Wednesday.

A Sunnyside landlord has sparked controversy by listing his two-bedroom apartment with a note that only “MAGA voters and Israel supporters” were invited to the open house.The landlord, 48-year-old Alexander Baran, posted the listing on Zillow on August 5. The listing was later removed.Tenant rights lawyer Joseph Tobener, a partner at Tobener Ravenscroft, said Baran’s actions are legal. “Political orientation is not a protected class under California or federal law,” Tobener told Fox News Digital. “Protected classes include ethnicity, religion or source of income. So this isn’t a violation of the fair employment and housing Act.”Tobener further said that changing the law to protect political affiliation would require an amendment to the state’s housing act, which could face legal challenges up to the Supreme Court.San Francisco has seen three major tech booms in recent decades — the dot-com boom, the social media boom, and now the AI boom — all of which have driven up rents. According to the Zumper National Rent Report, one-bedroom rents rose 13.3% and two-bedrooms 16.3% in the past year.Tobener said landlords now hold significant power in the market, making tenants wary of potential discrimination. ""Everybody should get a fair shake regardless of their political orientation. Everyone should be able to get access to housing. Housing is a fundamental right. Everyone needs housing. Everyone needs a roof over their heads. And so are we gonna start down this road where only certain people from certain political leanings can get access to certain housing.

(with inputs from Ashni Dhaor)





NOIDA: True to his name, Veer Singh did not hesitate for a moment. When cries of ""bachao-bachao"" pierced the afternoon air outside ATS Pristine society in Sector 150, the 45-year-old farmer enjoying a cup of tea nearby became the embodiment of courage.With no thought for his own safety, Veer leapt into a 20-foot-deep drain, determined to save a three-year-old girl fighting for her life below. Thus began a tense, half-hour struggle that would grip the entire neighbourhood.Singh, according to police, lives in a village near Sector 150, though his exact address remains unclear. The drama unfolded around noon on Friday, when Bijli, a 25-year-old tea vendor, handed her daughter Anushka a toy while tending to customers. Moments later, the child tumbled into the uncovered drain as her mother looked the other way.""Veer didn't hesitate for a second. He jumped straight in after hearing the girl's cries and managed to lift her out of the water after about half an hour,"" a police officer said. Guards from the nearby society rushed to help, and together, they pulled Veer and the frightened toddler to safety.Rajesh Kumar, who stood nearby, was witness to the frantic rescue.""The drain was filled with water up to 15ft. There was a real risk of both the toddler and the man drowning. People tried to help by lowering a wooden ladder, but with wet hands and a terrified child in arms, it was almost impossible for Veer to hold on. Another ladder was brought from the other side, but even reaching it was a struggle,"" he said.For 30 agonising minutes, the scene was a blur of panic and hope. ""The mother's screams, the crowd's anxiety, and Veer's sheer determination - it was a battle against exhaustion. But through it all, the farmer did not lose courage even for a bit,"" Kumar said.The guards threw down a rope, which Veer managed to wrap around himself and the ladder. Locals joined in, pulling the rope as Veer emerged from the drain, Anushka clinging to him.The crowd broke into an applause as the two finally reached to safety, many among them recording the final moments. ""The girl was shaken, but alive,"" a witness said.By the time police arrived, Veer had quietly left, but his heroism became the talking point. ""We found out about him from people who were there and the girl's parents,"" said Chetan Chaudhary, sub-inspector for the area.The incident reignited concerns over the open drain, which residents said poses a constant danger, especially to children and the elderly. Calls for the drain to be covered, they said, had elicited little response from the authorities, they alleged.Yet, the responsibility for the drain's safety was mired in bureaucracy.Officials at Noida Authority said the road and drain fell under the jurisdiction of the irrigation department, which had built it originally.The irrigation department, however, denied responsibility. ""The main Noida drain along Pushta Road is surrounded by shrubs and is 20 metres wide. Children are unlikely to reach it,"" an official claimed.SDM (Sadar) Ashutosh Gupta, however, told TOI, ""The drain in the video is under the jurisdiction of Noida Authority, not the irrigation department.""","A three-year-old girl fell into a 20-foot-deep drain in Sector 150, Noida, India. Farmer Veer Singh, 45, leapt into the water to rescue the girl.

‘Shocked’ Zelensky Quietly Watches As NATO Nation Leader Beckons Russia With Praise





Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for tougher sanctions on Russia after Moscow launched its largest aerial assault since the start of the war, striking government buildings and residential areas across the country.In a series of posts on X, Zelenskyy said international condemnation must be matched by concrete steps. ""It is important that today we saw a broad response from our partners to this strike. Clearly, Russia is trying to inflict pain on Ukraine with even more brazen attacks. This is a clear sign that Putin is testing the world – whether they will accept or tolerate this,"" he said.“That is why statements by state leaders and institutions must be backed by strong actions – sanctions against Russia and individuals connected with Russia, tough tariffs and other restrictions on trade with Russia. Their losses must be felt. That is what is truly convincing,” further added Zelenskyy.Further accusing Putin of not wanting an end to the war, he added, ""Equally important – our long-range capabilities. Putin does not want negotiations, he is clearly hiding from them, so Russia’s fuel shortages and other economic troubles are the logical response to its refusal to agree to a ceasefire or a meeting at the leaders’ level.""Zelenskyy's remarks came after the overnight assault that led into Sunday, involved more than 800 drones and 13 missiles, including four ballistic, according to Ukrainian officials. For the first time, the Cabinet of Ministers building in Kyiv was directly hit, with a fire breaking out on its upper floors. Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko confirmed the damage, saying: “For the first time, the Government building, its roof, and upper floors were damaged by the enemy attacks. Rescuers are extinguishing the fire. I thank them for their work.”Air raid sirens rang out in Kyiv for 11 hours. An infant was among at least two people killed when residential buildings were struck, with dozens more injured. “In one of them, the floors between the 4th and 8th stories have collapsed. As of now, two people have been reported killed, including one child,” Zelenskyy said.Other regions were also hit. “More than 20 houses and a kindergarten were damaged in Zaporizhzhia. Warehouses were destroyed in Kryvyi Rih, one person was killed in Safonivka, Sumy region, and another one in the Chernihiv region. A residential high-rise was hit in Odesa. Many regions have been affected over the past day,” Zelenskyy added.He condemned the strikes as “vile,” calling them a “deliberate crime and a prolongation of the war.” He urged allies to deliver on previous commitments made in Paris and Washington to strengthen Ukraine’s air defences. “Every additional system saves civilians from these vile strikes,” he said.The Ukrainian President's call for sanctions followed US President Donald Trump , who said, that he was prepared to impose additional sanctions on Moscow. Asked if he was ready to move to a “second phase” of measures against Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump replied: “Yes, I am.”Trump also said European leaders would visit the White House on September 8 or 9, adding that he expects to speak “soon” with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of efforts to end the war in Ukraine.The attack, which surpassed a massive bombardment in July, comes amid renewed Western efforts to broker a peace deal. Russian President Vladimir Putin warned last week that any Western troops deployed in Ukraine would be considered “legitimate targets for defeat.” “The world can force the Kremlin criminals to stop the killings – all that is needed is political will,” Zelenskyy said.","Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for tougher sanctions on Russia.

NEW DELHI: Elon Musk on Sunday defended X's fact-checking system after Peter Navarro, an aide to former US President Donald Trump, criticised the platform for fact-checking his anti-India post. Musk said the platform is committed to community-driven narrative without directly addressing Navarro.Musk wrote on X, ""On this platform, the people decide the narrative. You hear all sides of an argument. Community Notes corrects everyone, no exceptions. Notes, data, and code is public source. Grok provides further fact-checking.""Navarro posted anti-India content, criticising New Delhi's Russian oil imports, but received fact-checking corrections on X that challenged his claims as hypocritical.His post read: ""FACTS: India highest tariffs costs US jobs. India buys Russian oil purely to profit/Revenues feed Russia war machine. Ukrainians/Russians die. US taxpayers shell out more. India can't handle truth/spins.""X's fact-checking system highlighted that India's oil purchases serve energy security needs and comply with sanctions. It noted the US-India trade surplus in services and pointed out America's continued Russian imports.Additional fact-checking noted the legitimacy of India's sovereign oil purchases and their compliance with international law.The platform highlighted the inconsistency in US criticism of India's oil trade whilst maintaining its own Russian imports, including uranium.Navarro reacted negatively to the fact-checks, criticising Musk for allowing what he termed ""propaganda"" in posts.He wrote: ""Wow. @elonmusk is letting propaganda into people's posts. That crap note below is just that. Crap. India buys Russian oil solely to profiteer. It didn't buy any before Russia invaded Ukraine. Indian govt spin machine moving high tilt. Stop killing Ukrainians. Stop taking American jobs.""Navarro has consistently criticised India, particularly following Trump's implementation of secondary tariffs exceeding 50 per cent on Indian exports. He termed the Russia-Ukraine conflict as ""Modi's war"", suggesting India's Russian oil purchases support Moscow's military actions. He also described India as a ""laundromat for the Kremlin"" and made discriminatory remarks about caste.","X's fact-checking system highlighted that India's oil purchases serve energy security needs and comply with sanctions.

US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that Democrat Zohran Mamdani is likely to become New York City's next mayor unless two of his three major rivals drop out. However, the Republican leader declined to name which candidates he thought should quit.Speaking at a White House dinner with tech executives, Trump denied urging anyone to exit the race but suggested the crowded field benefits Mamdani. ""I don't think you can win unless you have one-on-one, and somehow he's gotten a little bit of a lead,"" Trump said. ""I would like to see two people drop out and have it be one-on-one, and I think that's a race that could be won.""Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, became the presumptive frontrunner after defeating former governor Andrew Cuomo in June's Democratic primary. But both Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams remain on the ballot as independents, joined by Republican Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels.Behind the scenes, Trump allies have floated scenarios for narrowing the race. Intermediaries recently reached out to Adams' circle about the possibility of him dropping his campaign for a federal role, according to people familiar with the talks, AP reported. Adams, indicted last year on corruption charges before prosecutors dropped the case, has said he will not leave the race.""No pressure, no diamonds,"" Adams said Thursday.Cuomo has openly called for Adams to quit, arguing that Mamdani poses ""an existential threat"" to Democrats. Sliwa, meanwhile, rejected speculation that Adams' voters would automatically migrate to Cuomo and insisted he is staying in the race. ""I can assure you for the 9,852th time: I'm not dropping out. I'm in it until November 4,"" Sliwa said.Meanwhile, Mamdani threw down a challenge to Trump, daring him to face off in a televised debate. This came after Cuomo urged him to take part in five debates, one in each borough.""Let's cut out the middle man,"" Mamdani told The New York Post. ""Why should I debate Donald Trump's puppet when I could debate Donald Trump himself?""""If Donald Trump is serious about intervening in the mayoral race, he should come to New York City and debate me directly about why he's cutting SNAP benefits for hungry New Yorkers to give tax breaks to his wealthy donors,"" Mamdani told New York Post.","US President Donald Trump says Democrat Zohran Mamdani is likely to become New York City's next mayor unless two of his three major rivals drop out.

Trump Rebrands ‘Woke’ Pentagon, Announces ‘Department Of War’ | ‘Just Sounds Better…’





The White House on Thursday announced that US President Donald Trump is renaming the department of defence to ""department of war,"" fulfilling his long-standing wish of rebranding it to project a more powerful image.White House, in an official statement, said that Trump will sign an executive order permitting use of the ""department of war"" as a ""secondary title"" for the sprawling department, as Congress establishes its official title.According to Fox News, the move to formally restore the Pentagon's historic name, directing the department of Defence to be once again called the department of war is part of the administration's ""warrior ethos"" campaign.It will make ""department of war"" a secondary title for the agency, with defence secretary Pete Hegseth adopting the title ""secretary of war."" A White House fact sheet says the order also instructs Hegseth to propose legislative and executive steps to make the change permanent.The rebranding will extend beyond titles. A White House official said Pentagon websites and signage will be updated, including renaming the public affairs briefing room the ""Pentagon War Annex.""Longer-term changes are being planned.Trump has teased the shift in recent days, telling reporters on August 25, ""Everybody likes that we had an unbelievable history of victory when it was department of war. Then we changed it to department of defense.""Hegseth, who has already been introduced by Trump as ""secretary of war,"" echoed the president's reasoning, calling the new name symbolic of a cultural shift. ""We won WWI and WWII not with the department of defense, but with a war department,"" he said Wednesday on Fox & Friends. ""We're not just defence, we're offence. Words and names and titles matter.""The department of war served as the nation's primary military authority until 1949, when Congress renamed it the department of defence under the National Security Act of 1947 as part of sweeping postwar reforms.","US President Donald Trump is renaming the department of defence to ""department of war"" The move is part of the administration's ""warrior ethos"" campaign.

US president Donald Trump on Sunday snapped at a reporter after she pressed him on whether he was preparing to “go to war” with Chicago. The question came a day after Trump shared a meme warning that the city would soon learn about the newly renamed “Department of War. ”Trump, speaking to reporters before heading to New York for the US Open, dismissed the question with, “When you say that, darling, that’s fake news.”When she tried to continue, he cut her off sharply. “Be quiet, listen! You don’t listen! You never listen. That’s why you’re second-rate,” Trump told the NNC reporter. “We’re not going to war, we’re gonna clean up our cities. We’re gonna clean them up, so they don’t kill five people every weekend. That’s not war, that’s common sense.”Pressed on why Chicago was being singled out, Trump pointed to its recent homicide figures. “Do you know how many people were killed in Chicago last weekend? Eight. The week before? Seven. Do you know how many were wounded? Seventy-four people,” he said.Trump’s Truth Social post on Saturday featured an Apocalypse Now-style meme that read, “I love the smell of deportations in the morning.Chicago is about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR.”Just a day earlier, Trump had signed an executive order to restore the Pentagon’s old name, Department of War, from the pre-World War II era. He has also floated sending the National Guard into Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans to tackle violent crime. Last month, he deployed troops in Washington, DC, and even took control of the city’s police department.But legal challenges are mounting. A federal judge recently ruled that Trump broke the law by sending the Guard into Los Angeles without state approval.","The president was speaking to reporters before heading to New York for the US Open.

US President Donald Trump on Sunday claimed that Israel has finally accepted his proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release framework and gave Hamas “last warning” to accept his terms for ending the Gaza war.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, ""Everyone wants the Hostages HOME. Everyone wants this War to end! The Israelis have accepted my Terms. It is time for Hamas to accept as well. I have warned Hamas about the consequences of not accepting. This is my last warning, there will not be another one!

In exchange, Israel would release Palestinian prisoners and halt its advance into Gaza City. Negotiations would take place under Trump’s direct oversight, with the ceasefire holding as long as talks continued, Times of Israel reported.Israel has not confirmed its acceptance, but a source close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the government is “very seriously considering” the proposal. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged Israel to back the deal, calling it a potential “breakthrough.”After the “last warning,” Hamas responded with a guarded statement, saying it “is ready to immediately sit at the negotiating table to discuss the release of all prisoners in exchange for a clear declaration to end the war, a total withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and creation of a committee of independent Palestinians to run the Gaza Strip.”“Hamas welcomes any move that helps the efforts to stop the aggression against our people,” Times of Israel quotes statement, affirming that it received “some ideas from the American side aimed at reaching a ceasefire.”Hamas says it is in “constant contact with the mediators to turn these ideas into a comprehensive agreement that meets our demands.”Opposition leader Yair Lapid accused Netanyahu’s government of stalling negotiations despite mediators’ efforts, warning, “There is a hostage deal on the table. It can be done, it must be done.”The reported framework comes as international pressure mounts against Israel’s Gaza City offensive, with critics warning it imperils both hostages and soldiers.The war, which began on October 7, 2023, has killed more than 64,000 people in Gaza, according to Hamas-run authorities, and over 460 Israeli soldiers.","US President Donald Trump claims Israel has finally accepted his proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release framework.

DUBAI: Undersea cable cuts in the Red Sea disrupted internet access in parts of Asia and West Asia, experts said on Sunday, though it wasn't immediately clear what caused the incident.There has been concern about the cables being targeted in a Red Sea campaign by Yemen's Houthi rebels, which the rebels describe as an effort to pressure Israel to end its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. But the Houthis have denied attacking the lines in the past.Undersea cables are one of the backbones of the internet, along with satellite connections and land-based cables. Typically, internet service providers have multiple access points and reroute traffic if one fails, though it can slow down access for users.Microsoft announced via a status website that West Asia ""may experience increased latency due to undersea fiber cuts in the Red Sea."" The Redmond, Washington-based firm did not immediately elaborate, though it said that internet traffic not moving through West Asia ""is not impacted.""NetBlocks, which monitors internet access, said ""a series of subsea cable outages in the Red Sea has degraded internet connectivity in multiple countries,"" which it said included India and Pakistan.It blamed ""failures affecting the SMW4 and IMEWE cable systems near Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.""The South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 4 cable is run by Tata Communications. The India-Middle East-Western Europe cable is run by another consortium overseen by Alcatel Submarine Networks. Neither firm responded to requests for comment. Pakistan Telecommunications Co. Ltd., a telecommunication giant in that country, noted that the cuts had taken place in a statement on Saturday.Saudi Arabia did not acknowledge the disruption and authorities there did not respond to a request for comment. In Kuwait, authorities also said the FALCON GCX cable running through the Red Sea had been cut, causing disruptions in the small, oil-rich nation. GCX did not respond to a request for comment.In the UAE, internet users on the country's state-owned Du and Etisalat networks complained of slower internet speeds. The govt did not acknowledge the disruption. Subsea cables can be cut by anchors dropped from ships, but can also be targeted in attacks. It can take weeks for repairs to be made as a ship and crew must locate themselves over the damaged cable. ap","Undersea cable cuts in the Red Sea disrupted internet access in parts of Asia and West Asia.
