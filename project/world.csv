Juna akhara to probe don’s ‘initiation’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/juna-akhara-to-probe-dons-initiation/articleshow/113209198.cms,"HARIDWAR: Juna Akhara , the largest body of Naga seers, has formed a seven-member committee to investigate the initiation of underworld don Prakash Pandey into monkhood inside Almora jail earlier this month, with a report due within three months. The committee convened a meeting at Nagina in Bijnor district of Uttar Pradesh , to determine their next steps.Pandey, also known as PP, was allegedly initiated by five seers claiming to be from Juna Akhara, who anointed him 'Swami Prakashanand Giri'.Sources said the akhara also entrusted Pandey with responsibilities for some ashrams in Uttarakhand.However, Mahant Hari Giri , the international president of Juna Akhara, denied the allegations, stating that there is a detailed process to become a seer in the akhara. He added that action will be taken once the committee submits its findings after three months.Meanwhile, activists have raised concerns about the duration of the probe. Ratanmani Dobhal , an activist, told TOI, ""Pandey is not an undertrial but a convict serving a life sentence. How can someone in his position become a seer, especially a Naga seer, which involves a rigorous and complex process? Why has the akhara formed a committee and given it three months? This appears to be an illegal appointment."" In addition to his life sentence, Pandey faces multiple court cases, including those related to extortion, robbery, and murder.This is not the first time Juna Akhara has anointed a controversial figure. In 2012, just before the Kumbh Mela, Radhe Ma was appointed as Mahamandaleshwar of Juna Akhara, only to be later listed as a ""fake seer"". Other contentious appointments include Golden Baba , who also faced several criminal charges.","Pandey, also known as PP, was allegedly initiated by five seers claiming to be from Juna Akhara.

DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand director general of police (DGP), Abhinav Kumar, ordered a probe on Monday following reports of villages - like Nyalsu , Shersi , Rampur Fata and Ravigram - in Kedar valley of Rudraprayag district putting up boards barring entry of 'outsiders'.Initially, the boards stated that 'non-Muslims, Rohingya Muslims and hawkers' should not be allowed in the villages, but they were changed to 'outsiders' on Saturday after police started removing them.DGP Kumar told TOI: ""After the incident came to our knowledge a couple of days ago, I directed SP, Rudraprayag, to probe the matter. If villagers are concerned regarding safety or security in their villages, they should raise it with authorities concerned. If they are taking any action on their own in that regard, it should not be biased. Local police have been asked to discuss the matter with villagers and resolve the matter amicably as per the law.""The state's top cop also said police will look into rights of gram sabhas in restricting movement of people in villages. ""Ensuring law and order is our main concern. However, safety and security of small settlements and villages in the hills are also among our top priorities,"" said Kumar.Pramod Singh, a village head of Rampur Fata, one such place where the boards had been put up, claimed the boards were to ""ensure the safety and security of women and children at home as most of our men go to Kedarnath during the yatra season to work"".He added: ""They return only once the season concludes. During that period, women and children in villages are vulnerable to crime. Nowadays, many unidentified hawkers enter the village to sell their items. The motive behind the boards is to ensure their proper verification is done from their hometown as well as local police here.""","Villages in Kedar valley of Rudraprayag district put up boards barring entry of 'outsiders' The boards stated that 'non-Muslims, Rohingya Muslims and hawkers' should not be allowed in the villages.

They also demanded that the unified command's control be transferred from the Union home ministry to the CM and called for the immediate removal of Assam Rifles and other central forces from Manipur. The students also urged the 50 non-Kuki-Zo MLAs to take a stand or resign.Similar protests broke out in Thoubal district, and thousands of locals in Kakching district held a mass rally against recent civilian killings.The ongoing conflict has seen the deployment of weaponised drones and long-range crude rockets, adding to the chaos.Manipur police said cadres from militant groups, including those that signed ""suspension of operations"" agreements or peace deals with the Centre, were involved in the violence.

The accused are now in judicial custody.NIA, which started investigating Rameshwaram Cafe blast case on March 3, conducted several technical and field probes in coordination with various state police forces and other agencies.Investigations revealed that Shazib, along with Taaha, was absconding since 2020 after Al-Hind ISIS module was busted. Extensive searches by NIA had led to arrest of accused from their hideout in West Bengal 42 days after cafe explosion.Shazib and Taaha, both hailing from Shivamogga district of Karnataka, were indoctrinated and influenced by ISIS's violent ideology and had earlier conspired to perform 'hijra' (religious visit) to ISIS territories in Syria. They were actively involved in radicalising other Muslim youth with ISIS propaganda, including other two chargesheeted accused, Ahmed and Shareef. Shazib and Taaha had used fraudulently-obtained Indian SIM cards and had opened Indian bank accounts in fake names, using various Indian and Bangladeshi identity documents downloaded from the dark web.Investigations further found that Taaha had been introduced by an ex-convict, Shoaib Ahmed Mirza, to his future handler Mohammed Shaheed Faisal, who is also an absconder in LeT Bengaluru conspiracy case. Taaha then introduced Faisal to Mehaboob Pasha, an accused in Al-Hind ISIS module case, and Khaja Mohideen, amir of ISIS South India, and later to Maaz Muneer Ahmed.

AGRA : A 60-year-old dhaba owner, Mohd Saleem, changed the name of his 20-year-old vegetarian eatery after ""repeated threats from a section of the majority community, including a seer"". Saleem, who runs 'Sangam Shudh Shakahari Bhojnalaya' on Delhi-Dehradun Road in Rampuri under Civil Lines limits of Muzaffarnagar, said he was forced to take the decision after Swami Yashveer Maharaj , a seer of a local ashram, allegedly issued a ""public warning to Muslim owners operating business with names of Hindu deities or pilgrimage sites"".It was renamed 'Saleem Dhaba' on Friday and the owner has written his name as 'Proprietor Saleem Thakur'. When asked about it, he said, ""We are Muslim Rajputs therefore I have used Thakur with the name.""Saleem told TOI on Sunday: ""This dhaba was started by my father years ago, but I was left with no choice after the warning from Swami and others. I just want to live in peace and so decided to take this step voluntarily.

The Swami could be also heard purportedly giving an ""ultimatum"", saying: ""They have time till 10am on Sept 7 to remove the names"". The 'video' was widely-shared online later and created apprehension among some minority traders and eatery owners.DSP (Phugana), Sant Kumar, who subsequently met the seer, said, ""The matter is in the SC and its guidelines will be followed at all cost.""SDM Nikita Sharma added, ""We've told Swami not to take steps on their own and escalate the matter.""Notably, during kanwar yatra, local administration had issued an advisory directing shopkeepers to temporarily put the owner's name on their business units.

The keys to the White House

The 13 keys are as follows:

Trump vs Harris

Historical impact and legacy

Allan Lichtman , a distinguished historian and political analyst, is often dubbed the "" Nostradamus of presidential election predictions"" due to his remarkable accuracy in forecasting the outcomes of US presidential races.Since 1984, Lichtman has successfully predicted the winners of nine out of the last ten presidential elections, employing a unique model he developed called the "" Keys to the White House .""This model consists of 13 true-false statements that assess the political landscape and the performance of the incumbent party, allowing Lichtman to make his predictions based on historical trends rather than polling data or campaign strategies.Born on March 18, 1947, in New York City, Lichtman earned his PhD in history from Harvard University. He has spent much of his academic career at American University in Washington, DC, where he specializes in US political history.His scholarly work encompasses a range of topics, including the history of American politics and the dynamics of presidential elections. Lichtman's academic background and deep understanding of political history have equipped him with the tools necessary to analyze electoral trends and outcomes effectively.Lichtman's predictive model, the ""Keys to the White House,"" was developed in collaboration with geophysicist Vladimir Kogan in the early 1980s. The model relies on 13 keys that evaluate various aspects of the political environment, including the incumbent party's performance in midterm elections, the presence of significant challengers, economic conditions, and the absence of scandals. Each key is assessed as either true or false, and if six or more keys are false, the incumbent party is predicted to lose the election.Party Mandate: The incumbent party has more seats in the House of Representatives following the midterm elections compared to the last midterm.Nomination Contest: There is no significant challenge to the incumbent party's nomination.Incumbency: The sitting president represents the incumbent party.Third-party Factor: There is no noteworthy third-party or independent campaign.Short-term Economic Stability: The economy does not face recession during the election period.Long-term Economic Growth: Real per capita economic growth equals or surpasses the average growth of the preceding two terms.Policy Shift: The incumbent administration enacts major alterations in national policy.Social Stability: There is no prolonged social unrest throughout the term.Scandal-Free: The incumbent administration remains free from major scandals.Foreign/Military Failures: The incumbent administration has not faced major failures in foreign or military matters.Foreign/Military Successes: The current administration achieves significant successes in foreign or military affairs.Incumbent Charm: The candidate from the incumbent party possesses charisma or enjoys national hero status.Challenger Appeal: The opposing party's candidate lacks charisma or national hero status.In his latest prediction for the 2024 presidential election, Lichtman asserts that Kamala Harris will defeat Donald Trump, maintaining Democratic control of the White House. He bases this prediction on an analysis of the 13 keys, concluding that eight keys favor Harris while only three favor Trump. Notably, Lichtman emphasizes the importance of the political landscape, including economic indicators and the absence of significant social unrest or scandals, in shaping electoral outcomes.For instance, Lichtman pointed out that the Democrats lost seats in the House during the 2022 midterm elections, making the ""Party Mandate"" key false. However, he noted that Harris benefits from a lack of significant third-party challengers and positive economic indicators, which favor her candidacy. Lichtman's approach is distinct from traditional political commentary, as he largely ignores polls and campaign strategies, focusing instead on historical patterns and the structural dynamics of elections.Lichtman's predictions have garnered significant attention, particularly for their accuracy. He was one of the few analysts to predict Donald Trump's victory in 2016, despite widespread belief that Hillary Clinton would win. His ability to foresee Biden's victory in 2020 further solidified his reputation as a reliable predictor of electoral outcomes.","Allan Lichtman is a distinguished historian and political analyst.

Nepotism and favoritism: What ails Pakistan cricket,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/nepotism-and-favoritism-what-ails-pakistan-cricket/articleshow/113187235.cms,"'Favourites imposed'

'No knowledge of the game'

NEW DELHI: There has been discussion regarding the intrusion of politics into sports as a result of Pakistan 's dismal recent results in international cricket. It is argued that nepotism at the top is impeding progress on the field.Last week, following a shocking 0-2 home series loss to Bangladesh, Pakistan dropped to ninth place in the Test rankings-their lowest position in almost sixty years.It was the nation's tenth consecutive home Test match without a victory, and it came after the team suffered humiliating early eliminations from the 50-over and T20 World Cups the previous year.Mohsin Naqvi , the current chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ), who also works full-time as the interior minister of a country that is experiencing an increase in terrorist attacks.Over the last 24 months, Pakistani cricket has seen four different coaches, three different board chairs, three different captains, and multiple domestic competition formats-unpredictability that analysts attribute to political whims.""This has a knock-on effect on team performance,"" said cricket journalist and former PCB media manager Ahsan Iftikhar Nagi.""When we have chaos and chronic instability within the management of the board it will reflect on-field performances,"" he told AFP.Pakistan's favorite sport is unquestionably cricket, with players hailed as national heroes, sponsored by luxury brands, and packed stadiums for big matches.With over 240 million people in the country, the sport has great cultural and political cachet because it transcends all social divisions.After leading his team to win in the 1992 ODI World Cup, former prime minister Imran Khan used his achievements as an international player to launch his political career.He was prime minister from 2018 to 2022, but he is presently incarcerated on allegations he says were made up to keep him from running in the elections earlier this year.This Monday, he released a statement from prison in which he detailed numerous grievances over his incarceration and explained how the political intrigues he claims are impeding him are to blame for the problems in cricket.""Favourites have been imposed to run a technical sport like cricket. What are Mohsin Naqvi's qualifications?"" he asked, claiming Naqvi had ""annihilated"" the team.""Nations are destroyed when corrupt and incompetent people are placed into positions of power in state institutions,"" he claimed.In Pakistan, nepotism and favoritism are pervasive. According to commentators, Khan ran on a platform of fighting corruption, but the strong military establishment helped him win the election and into office.The former superstar's tenure in government, during which he appointed his own preferred PCB chief and meddled in the local game structure, coincided with the national team's decline.Journalist Najam Sethi, who was chosen three times to lead the PCB, claimed the position had become into a ""sinecure"" meant to boost one's prestige.""Generals, judges and bureaucrats, just for a love of the game -- but no knowledge of the game -- have been appointed,"" he said.""Also, the cricketers with knowledge of the game but no managerial experience have been appointed.""The 2017 ICC Champions Trophy was Pakistan's most recent significant victory. They last prevailed in a home Test match in February 2021.They made it to the 2022 T20 World Cup final, which was their most noteworthy accomplishment. However, they lost shockingly to Ireland and the United States in the first round of the 2024 competition.Naqvi and the system that installed him have come under heightened scrutiny in parliament and the media following Bangladesh's defeat, prompting calls for his resignation.""Since 1998, hand-picked favourites of the respective ruling regimes in the country have taken turns as PCB chairmen to run the game in their own clueless manner, only to ruin it,"" the Express Tribune said.""They are busy working on their own respective agendas, which primarily relate to saving their own skin and seat, or making good money at the expense of the country's cricket.""The incongruity of Naqvi's two appointments became apparent when he presided over a press conference recently where the topics of a mass-casualty militant attack and cricket were discussed.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's close adviser Rana Sanaullah Khan seemed to be hinting this week that support for the PCB chief was eroding at the top.""It is his choice"" whether to continue, he told local news channel ARY. ""These two jobs are full-time roles.""","Pakistan dropped to ninth place in the Test rankings-their lowest position in almost sixty years.

Scene suggests possible sabotage attempt: FIR

KANPUR/LUCKNOW: The Shivrajpur police of Kanpur Nagar district have lodged an FIR for an alleged attempt to derail and blast the Bhiwani-bound Kalindi Express (14117). The loco-engine of the train had hit an LPG filled gas cylinder placed on the rail track between Barrajpur and Utripura on the Kanpur-Kasganj route on Sunday night. A 'petrol bomb' (Molotov cocktail), too, was found next to the rail track.Based on a written complaint by the railway staff on Monday, the police have lodged a complaint under Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita's sections 287 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter), 125 (whoever does any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or the personal safety of others) and under the relevant sections of the Explosive Substances Act and Railways Act.Six teams have been constituted to probe the case, and 12 suspects have been detained for questioning.The gas cylinder and the Molotov cocktail - a concoction of combustible liquid with a wick made of cloth - would have worked as a detonator to trigger a possible blast and fire once detonated, said the investigators.According to the FIR filed by Ramesh Chandra , junior engineer of North Eastern Railway, ""At 8:37 pm on Sunday, loco-pilots of Kalindi Express informed the railway control room that the train's loco-engine had hit a gas cylinder. Following this, at 9:10 pm, railway staff reached the location and inspected the area around the rail track. The staff found a petrol filled glass bottle with a wick lying next to the track, and a white bag.""""There were drag marks of the gas cylinder which was found lying on the right side of the rail track. The spot scene suggested a possible sabotage attempt to derail the train by an unknown person,"" read the FIR.According to railway authorities, prior to the Kalindi Express, the Kasganj-Kanpur Anwarganj passenger (15038) had left Barrajpur station at 5:18 pm.On Monday, inspector general, ATS, Neelabja Chaudhary, and his team of experts inspected the rail track between Barrajpur and Utripura.Chaudhary said, ""The forensic team is examining the case from different angles.""Additional commissioner of police, law and order, Kanpur, Harish Chander, confirmed to TOI, that the LPG cylinder had gas in it. ""It could have been fatal, had it blasted off,"" he added.Meanwhile, ACP, Kanpur, Ajay Kumar , said that more than 12 suspects have been taken into custody, and CCTV cameras are being scanned.""At the incident spot, rubber pad (used to create grip between concrete slipper and metal rail track) and pandrol clips (used to fasten the rail with concrete sleepers) were found lying near the tracks as well. We are probing this as well and other angles,"" an official said.This was the third incident in the region where an alleged sabotage attempt was made by placing obstacles on an active rail track.Earlier, on August 17, a 22 coach Sabarmati Express , originating from Varanasi and heading for Ahmedabad, had derailed near Kanpur after the locomotive collided with a metre-long old rusty rail chunk.Similarly, two men, including the son of a farmer leader in Farrukhabad, were arrested for attempting to derail the Kasganj-Farrukhabad passenger train (05389), by placing a wooden log on the Kanpur-Kasganj route between Bhatasa and Shamshabad railway stations on Aug 24.","The loco-engine of the train had hit an LPG filled gas cylinder placed on the rail track between Barrajpur and Utripura on the Kanpur-Kasganj route.

These substances are believed by some to grant financial success or political advancement, explained Labe Gneble, head of the National Organisation for Women, Children and the Family (ONEF).A ground-up clitoris can fetch up to $170—an amount equivalent to the monthly earnings of many Ivorian families.Describing the process, Diallo said, ""When they would cut the clitorises they would dry them for a month or two then pound them with stones,"" the end result being a ""black powder.""He added that it would be mixed with ""leaves, roots and bark"" or shea butter often used in cosmetics.The genitalia could be sold for approximately ""100,000 CFA Francs (152 euros) if the girl was a virgin,"" or ""65,000 CFA Francs (99 euros) if she had already given birth."" Alternatively, it could be traded for goods and services, he said.Female circumcision has been practiced across various religions in West Africa for centuries, typically performed on girls between childhood and adolescence.Many families view it as a rite of passage or a means to control and suppress female sexuality.Unicef condemns this practice, describing it as a severe violation of girls' fundamental rights and a dangerous act.","In Ivory Coast, genitalia removed during illegal ""circumcision"" ceremonies are used to create "" love potions "" or magical ointments.

The search for a man accused of a heinous attack on a nine-month-old baby has intensified following his swift escape from Australia, authorities confirm. A warrant has been issued for the arrest of a 33-year-old foreign national who is now believed to be overseas.On August 27, a disturbing incident unfolded at Hanlon Park in Stones Corner, Queensland, when a stranger approached a family and allegedly poured a boiling hot coffee over the infant before fleeing the scene.Surveillance footage captured the man running from the park, dressed in a black hat, glasses, a blue shirt, and cargo shorts.Detective Inspector Paul Dalton , leading the South Brisbane district Child Protection Investigation Unit, revealed that the investigation has faced significant hurdles, reported NBC. Despite identifying the suspect on September 1, just 12 hours after the CCTV footage was reviewed, the man had already left Australia on August 31. Dalton described the case as ""one of the most complex and frustrating"" of his career, noting the suspect's apparent counter-surveillance tactics.“It wasn’t until September 1 that we could name the individual,” Dalton explained. “We were initially given incorrect information, which added to the complexity.”The infant, who has undergone multiple surgeries, is now recovering from his injuries. His mother expressed her profound distress over the suspect's escape, revealing the emotional toll the attack has taken on her family. ""It sounds like they were very, very close in catching him,"" she said, her voice breaking with emotion.She described the ongoing fear and anxiety that now haunt her daily life. ""Returning home, I had panic attacks, and I still continue to do so. I will always have fear and anxiety being out in public with my son.""Authorities are working with international partners to locate and apprehend the suspect. While the country to which the suspect fled has not been disclosed, Dalton assured that efforts are underway to bring the accused back to face justice.“The Queensland Police Service is fully committed to doing everything we can lawfully to get this person back here,” Dalton said, reported NBC.A GoFundMe campaign launched for the baby has raised over $150,000, reflecting the public’s support. The boy’s father expressed gratitude for the financial and emotional backing received from the community, highlighting the family’s resilience amid their ordeal.As the investigation continues and the search for the suspect intensifies, the family remains hopeful for justice. “This horrific event should have never happened,” the boy’s mother said. “Hopefully one day justice will be served.”The case remains a stark reminder of the challenges faced in bringing perpetrators to justice, particularly when they evade capture and cross international borders.","A stranger poured boiling hot coffee over a nine-month-old baby in a park in Queensland, Australia, on August 27.

Yagi's devastation: A national crisis

Storm continues to threaten

In a devastating turn of events, the Phong Chau Bridge in northern Vietnam collapsed dramatically as Super Typhoon Yagi unleashed its full force over the weekend. The catastrophic failure of the busiest bridge in the country was captured in harrowing dashcam footage, showing vehicles plunging into the Red River below as floodwaters surged.The moment of disaster was starkly witnessed when a lorry, unable to stop in time, plunged into the raging waters as the bridge decking gave way.Deputy Prime Minister Ho Duc Phoc confirmed that ten cars and two scooters had fallen into the river.Nguyen Minh Hai , who was riding his motorcycle across the bridge when it collapsed, described his terrifying experience: “I was so scared when I fell down. I felt like I’d just escaped death. I can’t swim and I thought I would have died,” he said from his hospital bed, as reported by BBC.Watch video-The collapse occurred on Monday, following the typhoon's landfall on Saturday. More than 60 lives have been lost since Yagi struck, making it one of the deadliest storms to hit Vietnam in three decades. As rescue operations continued, authorities reported that 13 people were still missing, and searches were underway to locate them.In response to the disaster, the military has been mobilized to construct a temporary pontoon bridge to span the gap left by the collapse. Meanwhile, efforts to rescue survivors from the river have so far saved at least three people.The ongoing damage assessment revealed that part of the 375-meter (1,230-foot) bridge remains intact, though it is unclear when full repairs will be completed.Typhoon Yagi, which brought winds of up to 203 km/h (126 mph), has wreaked widespread havoc across northern Vietnam. The storm left 1.5 million people without power and caused severe infrastructural damage.The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development reported that landslides and flash floods, triggered by the typhoon, resulted in at least 44 deaths, including a 68-year-old woman, a one-year-old boy, and a newborn baby.The storm's wrath extended beyond human casualties; it tore roofs from buildings, uprooted trees, and inflicted extensive damage on factories. Notably, images from Reuters depict the collapsed walls of an LG Electronics factory in Hai Phong city, illustrating the typhoon's destructive force.Though Yagi has weakened into a tropical depression, authorities have warned that it will continue to cause disruptions as it moves westward. With more than 240 people injured, and the damage continuing to unfold, the full impact of Vietnam's most powerful storm of the year is still being assessed.","The Phong Chau Bridge in northern Vietnam collapsed as Super Typhoon Yagi struck.

Joseph Couch: Who is Joseph Couch? Man with military background behind Kentucky interstate shooting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-joseph-couch-man-with-military-background-behind-kentucky-interstate-shooting/articleshow/113179530.cms,"The incident

The manhunt

Couch’s background

Community response

Joseph A Couch, 32, is the man at the center of a massive manhunt following a shooting spree along Interstate 75 in southeastern Kentucky. Suspected of firing into 12 vehicles and injuring five people, Couch has been the target of a daylong search by local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies.On Saturday evening, Couch allegedly opened fire from a cliff above the interstate, targeting vehicles traveling both northbound and southbound.Authorities responded to reports of gunfire around 5:30 pm (local time), and Couch was quickly identified as a suspect after police recovered his abandoned SUV and an AR-15 rifle near the scene. In total, 20 to 30 rounds were fired, hitting 12 vehicles and leaving five people injured. Despite serious injuries, including one person shot in the face, all victims were reported to be in stable condition.The search for Couch has focused on a rugged, wooded area near the interstate, just outside the city of London, Kentucky. A drone and helicopter equipped with infrared technology have been employed to track his movements, but the challenging terrain has hindered efforts. Authorities suspended the search after nightfall on Sunday but are expected to resume early Monday.Local residents have been urged to lock their doors and avoid the search area, as Couch is believed to be armed and dangerous. Laurel County public schools canceled Monday classes as a precaution.Couch has a military background, having served in the National Guard for four years with an engineer battalion. Despite his service, he has had minor run-ins with the law, including a 2015 conviction for criminal mischief and unlawful transactions with a minor. Earlier this year, he was charged with ""terroristic threatening,"" but the case was dismissed due to the victim's failure to appear in court.Authorities are still investigating Couch’s motives for the shooting, which they described as a “random act” of violence. However, no specific targets were identified, and law enforcement officials emphasized that the attack appeared to be unplanned.The shootings have rattled the small community of London, Kentucky, with several local churches canceling services and residents anxiously following updates. Cody Shepherd, a local resident, noted that police scanners and helicopters dominated the weekend as authorities searched for Couch.""This is tragic... It's a wake-up call when it hits home,"" said Rodney Goodlett, pastor of Faith Assembly of God.As the search continues, police remain determined to bring Couch into custody, vowing to leave no stone unturned in the hunt.","Joseph A Couch, 32, is the man at the center of a massive manhunt following a shooting spree along Interstate 75 in southeastern Kentucky.

US woman senator using male chief of staff as 'sex slave': Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-woman-senator-using-male-chief-of-staff-as-sex-slave-report/articleshow/113209511.cms,"A California state senator has been accused of forcing her male chief of staff into a sexually abusive relationship, leading to physical injuries.Republican Senator Marie Alvarado-Gil, 50, faces a lawsuit filed by her former chief of staff, 57-year-old Chad Condit , in which he claims she used him as a ""sex slave,"" resulting in a serious back injury, the Daily mail reported.Condit, the son of former Congressman Gary Condit , alleges that Alvarado-Gil frequently coerced him into performing oral sex, including one instance in a car that led to herniated discs in his back.In the civil lawsuit filed in Sacramento superior court, he describes the relationship as ""sex-based quid pro quo"" marked by ""unwelcome advances and sexual behaviors coupled with punishment and flexing of power.""Alvarado-Gil, who was elected in 2022 and hired Condit soon after, fired him in December 2023. She has strongly denied the allegations, labeling Condit as ""a disgruntled former employee"" who has ""fabricated an outlandish story ... to get a payday.""According to the lawsuit, one incident occurred when the two were on a trip to Inyo County. After returning to the car, Condit claims, ""She had her pants pulled down and said, 'I want you to kiss it and prove your loyalty.'"" The lawsuit recounts that she exposed herself and demanded he perform oral sex. Condit says he complied out of fear and numbness after months of alleged abuse.Condit further claims that during one encounter in the confined space of a car, he suffered significant physical injuries.""He performed the act 'in a car seat with his body having to twist and contort,'"" which, according to the lawsuit, led to ""three herniated discs in his back and a collapsed hip.""As Condit began to resist her advances, he claims, Alvarado-Gil became unhappy and retaliated by threatening his job. The lawsuit details how her advances intensified, with the senator allegedly making inappropriate comments about his father’s scandal-ridden past and even discussing sexual fantasies with Condit and other staff members.The lawsuit also claims that Alvarado-Gil made remarks about ""throuples"" and speculated whether Condit’s wife would be interested in such a relationship.Condit alleges that Alvarado-Gil would make sexualized comments about colleagues, including stating that if Republican state Sen. Roger Niello ""was younger and I was single, I would jump his bones.""By August 2023, Condit says he began to reject her demands for oral sex, using his back injury as a reason. Shortly after, Condit claims he received a ""bogus disciplinary letter"" accusing him of inappropriate behavior. He also says Alvarado-Gil visited his home to accuse him of infidelity to his wife.In October 2023, Condit underwent surgery for his back injuries, and by the end of the year, Alvarado-Gil fired him. Condit asserts that before his termination, she had threatened to hire his wife, Helen , as further retaliation.The lawsuit also names the California State Senate, accusing its staff of allowing the alleged harassment. Condit claims the Secretary of the Senate ""blindly accepted Alvarado-Gil's retaliatory actions and ratified her abuse of him.""Secretary of the Senate Erika Contreras responded on Friday, stating that while the Senate takes all complaints seriously, it could not comment on ongoing litigation. Alvarado-Gil's attorney, Ognian Gavrilov , dismissed the allegations as the work of a ""disgruntled former employee"" seeking financial gain, asserting that the senator would be cleared of any wrongdoing.Condit and Alvarado-Gil have had a contentious relationship, with public feuds in the past. Alvarado-Gil previously filed an ethics complaint against Condit in May, seeking an investigation into his handling of infrastructure funding. Additionally, Alvarado-Gil, who switched her party affiliation from Democrat to Republican in August 2023, has been a controversial figure due to her stance on crime policies.The lawsuit does not allege any instances of sexual intercourse, but Condit claims the abuse was ongoing throughout his employment. Alvarado-Gil, a mother of six, is also married, and the lawsuit claims she had an understanding with her husband, who allegedly cheated on her as well.","Republican Senator Marie Alvarado-Gil, 50, faces a lawsuit filed by her former chief of staff, 57-year-old Chad Condit.

Jack White and Meg White , members of the White Stripes, sued Trump, his campaign, and his deputy director of communications, Margo McAtee Martin, on Monday in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York.Trump and his campaign used the song's iconic opening riff in a video of him boarding a plane for campaign stops in Michigan and Wisconsin last month.Sharing the complaint on Instagram, Jack White wrote, ""This machine sues fascists.""In the complaint, the White Stripes accused Trump and his campaign of “flagrant misappropriation” of one of the “most well-known and influential musical works of all time.”“Defendants did not seek a license from Plaintiffs to use the 'Seven Nation Army' work, but even if they had, Plaintiffs would not have granted one because Plaintiffs do not endorse, and do not want to be associated with Defendants in any manner,” the lawsuit stated, as per the Detroit News.“In total disregard of those considerations and Plaintiffs’ rights under federal law, Defendants decided that they would rather ask for forgiveness than seek permission, and incorporated the famous riff from the 'Seven Nation Army' work in the infringing Trump videos without authorization,” it added.The lawsuit also stated that the band objected to Trump's use of the song because its members “vehemently oppose the policies adopted and actions taken by Defendant Trump during his presidency and those he has proposed for the second term he seeks,” according to CNN.Last month, Jack White indicated that he would pursue legal action after Margo Martin, a deputy director of communications for the Trump campaign, shared a since-deleted video of Trump boarding a plane with “Seven Nation Army” playing on social media.This is not the first time an artist has criticized Trump for using their songs at rallies. Recently, Celine Dion, Foo Fighters, and ABBA have also expressed their disapproval of Trump using their music in his 2024 election campaign.Last month, Foo Fighters stated that they did not authorise the Trump campaign to use their song “My Hero,” which was played at a rally in Arizona where Trump was joined by Robert Kennedy Jr, shortly after Kennedy endorsed the former president.Pop star Celine Dion's management team released a statement condemning the use of her classic song ""My Heart Will Go On"" during a campaign rally.","Jack White and Meg White, members of the White Stripes, sued Trump, his campaign, and his deputy director of communications.

"US elections 2024: Harris leads national polls ahead of key debate, but Trump narrows gap in swing states",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-2024-harris-leads-national-polls-ahead-of-key-debate-but-trump-narrows-gap-in-swing-states/articleshow/113208649.cms,"US elections: Polling expert noted that the momentum has shifted slightly in Trump’s favor, warning that Harris could face further challenges as Republicans continue to paint her as too progressive.

Polls show a close race

Swing state showdown

High-stakes debate ahead

Tight polls, strong fundraising for Harris

Momentum shifts and challenges

As the 2024 US presidential election approaches on November 5, what was expected to be a repeat of the 2020 election turned into a high-stakes contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump following Joe Biden's exit from the race for the White House. This left the nation wondering whether it would witness a historic moment with its first female president or a return to Trump’s leadership.Polls had consistently shown Biden trailing Trump before he exited the race.At that time, Kamala Harris was also not polling strongly, but after hitting the campaign trail, she managed to narrow the gap. According to recent national polling averages, Harris led with 47%, while Trump sat at 44%, reported BBC. Harris’s campaign received a slight bump during the Democratic convention in Chicago, where she spoke of “a new way forward.” However, Trump’s endorsement by Robert F. Kennedy in late August did not seem to alter the race, as his numbers remained relatively steady.While these national figures offered insights, they did not paint the full picture due to the US Electoral College system. The real battle was fought in a handful of swing states—Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and others—that could tip the scales in either direction. In these key battlegrounds, the margin between the candidates was razor-thin, often less than one percentage point. Pennsylvania, with its significant electoral vote count, was expected to play a crucial role in determining the winner.The looming presidential debate is expected to be a game-changer. A New York Times/Siena poll suggested that Trump held a narrow one-point lead nationally, signaling that the race remained highly competitive. What was even more telling was that while 90% of voters said they knew all they needed to about Trump, only 71% said the same about Harris. This discrepancy meant that Harris had much more to prove during the debate, where a large audience was tuning in to decide between the two candidates.“We were up against a guy who was a convicted felon, a terrible president, and continued to be a terrible human,” a Democratic strategist said. “Yet, this race was still tight as a tick.”Despite the neck-and-neck race, some Democrats believed the tight polls could actually benefit Harris. “I was glad this poll came out. It was a gift to Democrats,” said Anthony Coley, a former Biden administration official, who saw the close numbers as a motivating factor.Polling expert Nate Silver also noted that the momentum had shifted slightly in Trump’s favor, warning that Harris could face further challenges as Republicans continued to paint her as too progressive. A Times poll reflected this narrative, with 44% of respondents agreeing that Harris was too progressive compared to 32% for Trump being too conservative.Still, Harris’s camp remained optimistic, with strategists pointing to her strong fundraising numbers. In August, her campaign raised a staggering $361 million—nearly triple what Trump’s campaign brought in. Democratic strategist Christy Setzer downplayed concerns over Trump’s recent lead in the polls, saying, “Anyone worried that a single poll, showing Trump up by a single point, needed more drama in their life.”Harris’s base continued to rally behind her, with packed campaign events across swing states. “The paths that Kamala Harris had to 270 [electoral votes] had expanded from when she stepped into the race,” noted Democratic strategist Joel Payne.As the campaign intensified, all eyes were on the upcoming debate, where Harris had the chance to elevate her candidacy and shift the narrative in her favor.",The 2024 US presidential election will be held on November 5. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are in a neck-and-neck race.

Kennedy Jr. will remain on the state’s November presidential ballot, despite his efforts to withdraw and endorse former President Donald Trump . Kennedy had suspended his independent campaign in August and filed a lawsuit to remove his name, fearing he would take votes away from Trump in the crucial battleground state.Kennedy’s lawyer, Aaron Siri, criticised the ruling, arguing it would confuse voters. “This plainly has nothing to do with ballot or election integrity,” he said, claiming the decision would mislead voters into supporting a withdrawn candidate. Meanwhile, Benson’s office praised the court's swift action, with spokesperson Angela Benander noting that election officials can now continue preparing ballots on time.Kennedy sued Michigan’s Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to withdraw from the ballot, hoping to prevent splitting votes in a state where Trump won by just 10,000 votes in 2016. However, the court's decision overturned a lower court ruling, ensuring Kennedy's name will remain. The justices stated that Kennedy ""has not shown an entitlement to this extraordinary relief.”The ruling undermines Kennedy's attempt to consolidate support for Trump. Last week, Kennedy encouraged his supporters to vote for Trump “no matter what state you live in.” While his poll numbers were in single digits before he withdrew, a recent CNN poll showed Kennedy still had 4% support in Michigan, a figure that could influence the outcome. The same poll found Vice President Kamala Harris leading with 48% against Trump’s 43%.Kennedy has tried to remove his name from ballots in other key states. He succeeded in North Carolina, but faced setbacks in Wisconsin and Michigan.","The Michigan Supreme Court ruled on Monday that Robert F.

Richard Dalrymple of the Laurel County Sheriff’s Office, states that Couch texted a woman at 5:03 p.m.saying, ""I’m going to kill a lot of people.

Couch is charged with five counts each of attempted murder and first-degree assault.A search of the area near where Couch’s vehicle was abandoned uncovered a green duffel bag with Couch’s name, spent shell casings, and a Colt AR-15 rifle. Authorities believe Couch fired 20 to 30 rounds, hitting multiple vehicles.Law enforcement has been conducting a rigorous search in a densely wooded area near London, Kentucky, where the shooting took place. Local officials have pledged to continue the search until Couch is apprehended. ""We’re not going to quit until we do lay hands on him,"" said Sheriff John Root .Several school districts in southeastern Kentucky closed as the search continued into its third day.

Several top leaders of Imran Khan ’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party were arrested on Monday in Islamabad. The arrests included barrister Gohar Khan, Sher Afzal Marwat, and advocate Shoaib Shaheen, following a violent clash between PTI supporters and police during a protest demanding Khan's release. The arrests have been widely condemned by PTI as politically motivated.PTI has vehemently opposed the arrests, calling them a ""direct attack on democracy."" In posts on X (formerly Twitter), the party criticised the government's actions, arguing that the arrests are an attempt to suppress their movement.PTI leader Zulfi Bukhari condemned the detentions as ""illegal"" and said, ""These arrests won’t change anything; they will only increase public anger against this puppet government.""Omar Ayub Khan, another senior PTI figure, also denounced the arrests and revealed that police had been forming teams to apprehend him and other top PTI members, including Zartaj Gul Wazir . ""This fascist regime has gone completely mad... We will continue raising our voices for our leader, PM Imran Khan ,"" he wrote on X.Despite the crackdown, many PTI lawmakers remained inside Parliament House to avoid arrest, and more detentions are expected in the coming days. The Islamabad high court bar association has also condemned the arrests, demanding the release of Marwat and Shaheen, both respected members of the legal community.The arrests occur amidst growing political tension in Pakistan. Imran Khan, who has been imprisoned since 2022 on corruption charges, remains a central figure in the country's political landscape. His supporters’ continued protests and the government’s aggressive response have only heightened the political discord.The arrests were made under the newly enacted Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Bill, 2024. This legislation, which came into effect just before the PTI rally, empowers authorities to regulate and ban public gatherings in Islamabad. Under this law, the district magistrate can disband any assembly deemed likely to disturb public peace, with penalties including up to three years in prison or fines. Repeat offenders face even harsher penalties, potentially extending to 10 years of imprisonment. The PTI leaders were accused of violating these regulations by inciting their supporters to clash with police during the protest.","Top leaders of Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party were arrested on Monday in Islamabad.

NEW DELHI: In an unusual critique of the military establishment, Pakistan 's deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar has connected a visit by a ""three-star general to Kabul for tea in 2021"" to the recent uptick in terrorism throughout the country.In September 2021, as the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan after the sudden pullout of US troops in August, then ISI chief general Faiz Hameed had visited Kabul and was photographed enjoying tea, during which he assured a journalist that ""everything will be fine"" -- a pivotal point in Pakistan's military and intelligence strategy towards Afghanistan.""The country is paying a price for that cup of tea in Afghanistan,"" said Dar, without naming Hameed.The deputy PM further said that the decision by the general to release some militants was the reason behind increased attacks across Pakistan. ""Those released at that time are masterminding terrorism in Balochistan today,"" he said, indicating there is a widely held belief that the decisions made by military leaders during this period were not only misguided but have also contributed to the current instability in Pakistan.Dar, who also holds the foreign affairs portfolio, made the rem­a­rks during a press conference at the Pakistan High Commi­ss­i­on in London.Stating that the 2021 visit to Kabul could not have happened without the permission of former PM Imran Khan, Dar hit out at the ""mistakes"" made by the ousted leader, particularly in relation to economic and security decisions, and linked the former administration's ""missteps"" to the current rise in terrorism and economic challenges.""I find it difficult to accept that he [Hameed] could have gone without the permission of the prime minister [Imran Khan]. We are working with the security establishment on issues today, these things are not possible without the PM's approval,"" said Dar.After criticising military officials of the ""past"", Dar was quick to praise the curr­ent military establishm­ent.""They cannot be praised en­o­ugh as its members are very professional. Their agenda is Pakistan, as is ours. This is a very good omen. They are not interested in who comes in government or opposition,"" he said.The Taliban's rise to power was initially seen by some in Pakistan as a potential boon, with expectations that the group would help curb the activities of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that has long posed a threat to the Pakistani state.However, the reality has proven to be quite different, with the TTP intensifying its attacks since the Taliban's takeover, undermining the very stability that Pakistan hoped to achieve through its support of the Taliban.The situation in Balochistan is particularly alarming. The province has witnessed a significant uptick in violence, with attacks attributed to both the TTP and other militant groups.The Pakistani military's response has included increased operations against these groups, but the effectiveness of these measures remains in question. Dar's comments suggest a recognition that past decisions, particularly those made by military leaders like Hameed, have directly contributed to the current security crisis.","Pakistan's deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar has connected a visit by a ""three- star general to Kabul for tea in 2021"" to the recent uptick in terrorism.

Militants target vaccination teams and police assigned to protect them, falsely claiming that the campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children.The latest attack came hours after Pakistan launched a drive to vaccinate 30 million children against polio. Since January, Pakistan has reported 17 new cases, jeopardizing decades of efforts to eliminate polio in the country.Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan are the only countries in which the spread of polio has never been stopped.The potentially fatal, paralyzing disease mostly strikes children under age 5 and typically spreads through contaminated water.","No polio workers were hurt in the attack in South Waziristan, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Imran Khan's party stage rally in Islamabad; demand his immediate release,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-khans-party-stage-rally-in-islamabad-demand-his-immediate-release/articleshow/113173655.cms,"Jailed former premier Imran Khan 's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf on Sunday held a power show, demanding his immediate release while slamming the government for its crackdown on the party as police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. The rally - postponed twice in the last two months - was held near Sangjani Cattle Market in the suburbs of Islamabad after the capital administration issued a no-objection certificate (NOC).Thousands of PTI supporters attended the rally, proving that the party's power base was intact despite several hurdles it faced, including the incarceration of its 71-year-old founder.Khan was arrested on August 5 last year after his conviction in the Toshakhana corruption case filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan. Since then, he has been in jail in different cases. On Sunday, Khan completed 400 days in prison.The rally was scheduled to end at 7 pm (local time) as per the NOC. As soon as the deadline ended, the district administration directed the police to take action against the rally-goers for not complying with the NOC.The authorities stated that the organisers violated the rules and regulations by not concluding the gathering before the deadline.In response to the crackdown, PTI workers began pelting stones at police, injuring many security personnel, including Senior Superintendent of Police Shoaib Khan .""Strong turnout for PTI rally despite the state's tactics to limit numbers through roadblocks and containers, and despite the risk of violent crackdowns and arrests. Its size and popularity ensure its mobilization capabilities remain intact despite relentless attempts to curb it,"" Micheal Kugleman, a South Asian expert, said in a post on X.Several PTI leaders addressed the gathering, demanding Khan's immediate release. PTI leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan said the party would not sit until Khan was released.""We are soldiers of Imran Khan and will not sit until he is set free,"" he said, adding that soon Khan would be with his supporters.He condemned physical hurdles put on roads to restrict the movement of participants and also announced that the PTI would now hold rallies across the country.It was the first major rally by the PTI in Islamabad since the February 8 elections. The party wants to exert pressure on the government to release Khan, who languishes in jail despite the courts either acquitting him or giving him bail in all cases he was convicted.PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan said the government turned the city into a cage, but still thousands of people attended the rally. ""It shows that Imran Khan is a reality, and you will have to accept it...Imran Khan is a leader and will always be a leader,"" he said.He told the participants that Khan was their only leader who never surrendered and would never surrender. He warned that the PTI would not accept new cases against Khan.Gohar said that the PTI planned this rally for six months and followed Khan's instructions to hold the rally after getting permission from the government. He criticised the government for introducing a new law to restrict political activities.Slogans were raised during the rally demanding Khan's release from jail.He ended his speech with the promise that ""Imran Khan will be soon out of jail and with his people"".The key speech was made by Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur who came from Peshawar, leading a large number of Khan's supporters from the province.In his emotional address, he vowed to continue the struggle for the rights of people. He said those who put Khan in jail were being humiliated while ""Khan is winning in jail"".He said that the government gave permission for the rally and blocked all roads leading to the venue of the rally. ""Imran Khan you have won while all others lost,"" he said, vowing to go to any length for Khan.He also announced to hold the next rally in Lahore, irrespective of whether the government gives permission or not.Gandapur also rejected that Khan would be tried under army law, saying no one could do it.Khan has repeatedly shown a willingness to hold talks with the establishment while refusing to sit with the government. So far, all his tactics have failed to get any relief. Mass protest is an option, but his party has been facing pressure to avoid it.Today's rally was a test for both the government and the PTI as it will help them gauge the ground power swell for Khan and fine-tune their policies and tactics in the coming days.Sources told PTI that the Islamabad administration put security on high alert this morning and blocked off multiple arteries leading to the capital city. Hospitals were put on alert by the administration. The Metro bus services were stopped in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Addressing the rally, former minister Hammad Azhar said the hindrance created by the rulers showed that they were afraid of Khan and his supporters.He pointed out that most of the party's Punjab leadership is in jail, paying tribute to incarcerated leaders, including Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Umar Sarfraz Cheema .Another leader Sher Afzal Marwat said they will soon hold rallies in Punjab for Khan's release and the supremacy of law and the Constitution.""We will enter Punjab with 50,000 people from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa within a week,"" he said, adding that they will even set off on foot and face the tear gas.Additional forces have been summoned to the location where the clash between the police and party workers originally started.Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari signed into law the Public Order and Peaceful Assembly Bill 2024 hours before the planned rally, instituting strict measures for unauthorised gatherings.The new law introduces penalties for holding gatherings without permission in Islamabad, with violators facing up to three years in prison and fines. The repeat offenders could be sentenced to up to 10 years in jail.","Thousands of PTI supporters attended the rally, proving that the party's power base was intact. Khan was arrested on August 5 last year after his conviction in the Toshakhana corruption case filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan. On Sunday, Khan completed 400 days in prison.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113173659,imgsize-1806204,width-400,resizemode-4/113173659.jpg"
