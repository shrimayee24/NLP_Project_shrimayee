NEW DELHI: Tension gripped Yavat village in Daund tehsil of Pune district on Friday afternoon after an allegedly objectionable WhatsApp post by a youth from another community sparked violence.An irate mob vandalised properties and set a motorcycle ablaze, prompting police to use teargas and resort to a lathi charge to disperse crowds.Officials confirm no injuries or casualties, and say the situation is now under control, reported PTI.Police said the objectionable post was allegedly related to a Hindu religious figure.The post went viral Friday afternoon, sparking anger in a village already tense due to a past incident involving the desecration of a statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.By evening, mobs gathered and vandalised a bakery, torched a motorcycle, and damaged other properties. Police responded with teargas and a lathi charge to disperse the crowd. No injuries or casualties have been reported so far.Police confirmed the youth who posted the content was not a permanent resident of Yavat. He had been staying with his grandmother for some time after moving from Nanded.The authorities are investigating his motive and whether there are any links to previous provocations in the area.A First Information Report (FIR) has been registered and the youth is currently in police custody.In view of the unrest, Section 144 has been imposed in Yavat village for 48 hours to prevent gatherings and maintain peace. Heavy police deployment, including teams from the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF), has been put in place. Senior officers from Pune Rural police are stationed in the area, ANI reported.“We are appealing to all citizens not to believe in rumours. Strict action will be taken against those trying to disturb communal harmony,” said SP (Pune Rural) Pankaj Deshmukh.CM Devendra Fadnavis also issued a strong statement: “Some people are deliberately trying to disturb peace by posting offensive content. No one has the right to insult any religion or belief. We will not tolerate such acts and strict action will be taken.”Deputy CM Ajit Pawar said, “The government is closely monitoring the situation. Section 144 has been imposed and the police have acted promptly. I appeal to people to cooperate and maintain peace.”Police said the situation in Yavat had already been sensitive due to a recent speech by local representatives and past incidents involving insults to historical icons. The combination of old tensions and the latest post appears to have contributed to Friday’s unrest.Authorities continue to monitor the situation. Internet services have not been suspended yet, but officials say that may be considered if misinformation continues to spread.",An allegedly objectionable WhatsApp post by a youth from another community sparked violence.

He blamed senior Congress leaders including Sharad Pawar, Digvijay Singh, Sushilkumar Shinde, Shivraj Patil, P Chidambaram, Jayant Patil, Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, Shakeel Ahmed, and Ahmed Patel for the case. “If the Hindu community had not realised its duty and changed the government in 2014, we could not have come out alive,” he said, urging Hindus to ""never vote for Congress so that no innocent is trapped again. ""Kulkarni further alleged that investigating officers were pressured and evidence was tampered with. “Even the ATS and other officers were pressurised and evidence were erased or manipulated. There were a lot of ATS officers who didn’t know their statements were falsely recorded by their seniors,” he said.He claimed the motive behind implicating them was their opposition to Congress’ actions. “This was a conspiracy to defame Hindu community globally and mislead the minorities. .. the Congress leadership has been supporting the Pakistani ISI and if we want to save our future generations, Congress should completely be erased,” he added.Retired police inspector Mehiboob Mujawar, who was with the ATS during the initial investigation, echoed concerns about the legitimacy of the probe. Speaking to ANI, Mujawar claimed that he had been ordered to arrest RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat to bolster a “Bhagwa terror” narrative. “I did not follow the orders as they were horrific. As I did not obey, a false case was registered against me which destroyed my 40-year career,” Mujawar said. He asserted, “There was no saffron terrorism. Everything was fake.”On September 29, 2008, six people were killed and over 100 injured when a bomb strapped to a motorbike exploded near a mosque in Malegaon during Ramzan and on the eve of Navratri.

NEW DELHI: More than 65 lakh names were left out of Bihar’s draft electoral rolls, according to the Election Commission (EC), following a month-long Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise. The EC said Patna alone accounts for the highest number of missing voters, with 3.95 lakh names not included, followed by East Champaran, Madhubani and Gopalganj with 3 lakh voters, news agency PTI reported.The new draft rolls were released on Friday, kicking off a process during which citizens can file claims and objections until 1 September.The EC said Bihar had 7.93 crore registered voters before the SIR began in June, but no final tally for the revised rolls has been disclosed. According to EC data, 7.23 crore voters submitted enumeration forms during the exercise. Around 35 lakh were found to have permanently migrated or were untraceable, 22 lakh were reported dead, and 7 lakh were registered in more than one constituency. Another 1.2 lakh voters didn’t submit forms at all.The process involved 77,895 polling centres across the state, supervised by 243 Electors Registration Officers and nearly 3,000 assistant EROs.More than 1.60 lakh booth-level agents and other volunteers were involved in the data-gathering operation, which required voters to return signed enumeration forms along with identity documents, either physically or online.The EC has not published a consolidated statewide list, but voters can verify their status on the official website. District magistrates have shared draft rolls with political party representatives in districts such as Supaul, Nawada, Darbhanga, and Jamui. Assembly elections in Bihar are due later this year.The SIR has drawn sharp criticism from opposition parties, who allege that the mass exclusions serve to benefit the ruling NDA. Petitions were filed in the Supreme Court, which remarked earlier this week that the exercise should result in “en masse inclusion and not en masse exclusion.”Meanwhile, Parliament witnessed heated scenes over the SIR issue. The Rajya Sabha was adjourned on Friday amid loud protests by opposition members demanding a discussion on the EC’s move. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh claimed a “paramilitary takeover” after security personnel reportedly blocked MPs from entering the well of the House. Deputy chairman Harivansh denied requests for discussion, citing that the matter is sub judice, which only intensified the standoff.","More than 65 lakh names were left out of Bihar’s draft electoral rolls, according to the Election Commission.

Court slams use of UAPA, highlights gaps



(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: A special NIA court’s damning acquittal order in the 2008 Malegaon blast case has exposed major contradictions between the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) and the National Investigation Agency (NIA), raising serious concerns over coercion, flawed evidence, and the legality of the investigation.As per PTI, in the 1,036-page verdict, Special Judge AK Lahoti acquitted all seven accused, including BJP MP Pragya Singh Thakur and Lt Col Prasad Purohit, citing a lack of reliable and conclusive evidence.The court flagged glaring inconsistencies between ATS and NIA versions of how and where the bomb was assembled. According to the ATS, the RDX device was put together in a house in Pune and then handed to a now-absconding accused. The NIA, however, stated it was fixed onto a motorcycle in Indore and transported via the Sendhawa bus stand.""Thus, there is a material variance in their charge sheets and both the investigation agencies are not consistent with each other on the material aspects like fitting, transporting and involvement of accused,"" the judge observed, as reported by PTI.The court said the prosecution could not prove the ownership of the explosive-laden motorbike, nor conclusively establish that the blast was caused by the said vehicle.“The prosecution proved that a blast occurred in Malegaon but failed to prove that bomb was placed in that motorcycle,” the judge said.According to PTI, the judgement raised serious concerns over allegations of torture, coercion, and illegal detention of both accused and witnesses by ATS officers. Multiple witnesses testified that their statements were taken under duress and that they were physically assaulted.While prosecution argued that no formal complaints were filed, the court countered that absence of complaints does not invalidate the claims. “This raises serious concern over the credibility of the evidence collected by the ATS,” it said, noting that similar allegations were not made against NIA officers.The court directed its judgement be sent to the Directors General of both ATS and NIA for appropriate action.The court noted that charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) were filed without proper application of mind. The right-wing group ‘Abhinav Bharat’, allegedly linked to the accused, has never been banned or classified as a terror organisation.The court found no evidence that Purohit had stored or transported RDX from Kashmir, where he was posted, or that he assembled the bomb. It added that though money from Abhinav Bharat may have been used to fund construction of Purohit’s home, it did not prove intent to commit terrorism.The acquittal comes 17 years after the September 29, 2008 blast, which killed six and injured over 100 people near a mosque in Malegaon, a communally sensitive town in Maharashtra.The Maharashtra government has been ordered to compensate victims’ families with Rs 2 lakh each and injured persons with Rs 50,000.","A special NIA court’s damning acquittal order in the 2008 Malegaon blast case has exposed major contradictions between the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) The judgement raised serious concerns over allegations of torture, coercion, and illegal detention of both accused and witnesses.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123047784,imgsize-1807396,width-400,resizemode-4/123047784.jpg"

Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Friday unveiled the anti-drug curriculum to be introduced in schools under ""war against drugs"" campaign with an aim to make eight lakh students aware against the menace of drugs.Addressing the gathering, the AAP chief said this marks the beginning of a new chapter in Punjab's battle against drugs from the state's border district.Punjab's war against drugs has now reached a crucial stage, said Kejriwal, adding as part of the third phase of the state government's campaign ""Yudh Nashian Virudh"" (war against drugs) -- a special syllabus is being introduced in all government schools for students from classes 9 to 12.The former Delhi chief minister said that eight lakh students from these classes will be made aware of the dangers of drug abuse through this syllabus and encouraged to stay away from narcotic substances.Kejriwal said this anti-drug programme will involve 3,658 schools and renowned scientists will also take part in raising awareness among students.The curriculum will include 35-minute sessions to be conducted fortnightly over 27 weeks and will include documentaries, quizzes, posters and interactive activities, he added.The AAP national convener said these sessions will focus on major themes such as busting myths about drugs, strategies to say no to drugs and resisting peer pressure.This path breaking initiative will be replicated in other states too for wiping out the menace of drugs, he envisioned.Kejriwal said Punjab shares an international border with Pakistan which made it a drug route for smugglers.The AAP chief said the state government has already launched the ""Yudh Nashian Virudh"" (war against drugs) campaign and under this initiative, more than 15,000 drug traffickers have been sent to jail, properties have been seized and over 1,000 kilograms of heroin have been recovered.The properties acquired by drug smugglers through illegal drug trade are being demolished, he added.Targeting the previous regimes, Kejriwal said that they remained mum on the plight of the state due to drugs ""but are supporting the kingpin of drugs"".He said the 'Nasha Mukti Yatra' has reached more than 10,000 villages and wards of the state, adding the desired results are coming.The AAP national convener said it is the responsibility of every youth to support this unique and noble initiative of the Punjab government.It is unfortunate that no state or country has remained untouched by the menace of drugs, he added.Kejriwal exhorted the people of Punjab to unite and pledge to make the society drug-free.Addressing the gathering, chief minister Mann said the crusade against drugs has been ongoing for the past 150 days and hundreds of panchayats have passed resolutions pledging they will never support drug traffickers.This war against drugs has now transformed into a mass movement, said Mann, adding the state government has introduced anti-drug education into the school syllabus as part of it.The chief minister said students will be made aware of the dangers of drug addiction as the first use of drugs marks the beginning of a ruined life.A complete facelift of government schools has taken place due to the state government's strenuous efforts, he added.Mann claimed that students are leaving private schools and joining government schools which shows people's trust in them.He alleged the blot of drugs has been put on the face of the state by the previous governments.The chief minister said ""it took us time to formulate a strategy"" after his party came to power in the state.""The state government started de-addiction centres to ensure treatment for those giving up drugs. The state government is also working to skill them and enable them to live life with dignity and pride,"" he added.","Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal unveiled the anti-drug curriculum to be introduced in schools.

Yes, it encourages better governance No, actions must follow rules only





BAREILLY: An IAS officer, who once survived seven bullets after exposing a Rs 100-crore scam, was transferred within 36 hours of taking charge as sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) in Shahjahanpur's Powayan. The move came on Monday, hours after Rinku Singh Rahi hit the headlines once again - this time for performing sit-ups before a group of lawyers and cancelling two unpublicised land auctions.A video of the ""uthak-baithak"" was shared on social media. Rahi believes it may have cost him the post. Shahjahanpur DM Dharmendra Pratap Singh, however, told TOI, ""Rahi's transfer was initiated by the state govt and I have no idea about the precise reason behind it.""The auctions involved rights to village fish ponds and cattle shed land in Simra Viran. They were scheduled without public announcements, he said, a technical omission that could prevent fair bidding. ""More people deserve the chance to participate in such auctions. My decision may have upset some people,"" Rahi, a 2022 batch IAS officer, said.On the same day, he directed revenue officers to identify encroachments on govt land and issue notices.""If no notice is issued within 15 days, an FIR will be filed against the lekhpal concerned,"" he warned. He also planned to digitise tehsil-level records, including court proceedings and document submissions. ""People shouldn't have to file RTIs to get basic information,"" he said.After landing in the town for his latest posting, he proposed creating two WhatsApp groups in every village - one to allow residents to report absentee officials, and another to post complaints and their responses openly. ""I had already done this in Mathura as a provincial civil services officer. This is not innovation. This is basic administration.""But it was the sit-ups on Monday that drew public attention. After asking a clerk to do sit-ups for urinating in the open, Rahi himself performed sit-ups in front of lawyers at the tehsil premises after they pointed out filthy public toilets. ""I took responsibility because I was the senior-most officer. If seniors lead by example, systems improve,"" he said. Asked whether the video led to his transfer, he said, ""Could be. ""He added: ""I will serve wherever I'm posted. I'll not tolerate wrongdoing.""In 2008, as a provincial civil service officer in Muzaffarnagar, he exposed irregular transfers of social welfare funds. ""When I refused bribes and kept digging, I was warned,"" he said. On March 26, 2009, while playing badminton, he was shot in the face. The attack left him blind in one eye, with a bullet fragment lodged in his skull. ""I lost everything except the will to fight,"" he said.Four years later, in 2012, after being denied promotion, he staged a dharna outside the social welfare directorate in Lucknow. Police forcibly admitted him to a psychiatric facility. A decade later, he cleared the UPSC exam under the physically challenged category at age 40, secured all-India rank 683, and joined the 2022-batch IAS under the Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD) quota, UP cadre.His tenure in Shahjahanpur lasted less than two days.

He had also suggested that India would get a good deal for its compliance.Trump's outburst on Truth Social on Wednesday conflicted with his claim of having frog marched India to cease Operation Sindoor by dangling the threat of stopping trade.Interestingly, the 'all things not good' admission from the US president, who has earned the reputation of being the global scold because of his petulance and pugnacity, came on a day when the two Houses of Parliament concluded a debate on Operation Sindoor that was dominated by Trump's claim of having mediated the suspension of hostilities.Also read: India-US trade deal: Donald Trump imposes 25% tariffs on India - top developments On Tuesday, PM Modi had refuted Trump's claim, saying no global leader had asked him to cease the offensive, and that it was the sheer ferocity of the IAF strikes on Pakistan's airbases that led Islamabad to sue for peace on May 10. That was getting as close as an Indian PM could get to accuse the US president of inexactitude.External affairs minister S Jaishankar went a step further on both Tuesday and Wednesday, stating that Trump and Modi did not talk between April 22 and June 16 when in a telephonic conversation, Modi had rebutted the suggestion that the operation against Pakistan was ceased because of anyone's mediation.In a significant decision, the Modi govt got foreign secretary Vikram Misri to let out details of the conversation.

Tom Brady 's newsletter draws fire as sources say communication is now strictly about the kids

No emotional ties left between the former couple, says insider



Gisele Bündchen’s quiet clapback: moving on, privately but powerfully

Tom Brady’s attempt to open up about fatherhood in his 199 newsletter may have caused more damage than healing — especially when it comes to his relationship with ex-wife Gisele Bündchen. While the NFL icon reflected on what it means to be a “great father,” insiders say his remarks landed like a public jab at the woman who once sacrificed her own career to raise their kids.Though Brady didn’t mention Bündchen by name, his statement — “Reading bedtime stories and helping them with homework are not the only ways to be a great parent” — reportedly struck a nerve. According to a source cited in Rob Shuter’s #ShuterScoop, Bündchen saw the comment as a “personal dig.” The insider emphasized that the supermodel is growing tired of what they call the “narrative that he sacrificed everything for them,” adding bluntly, “He didn’t. She did.”The former power couple, who finalized their divorce in 2022, now reportedly have no “real relationship” outside of their children, Benjamin and Vivian. According to the source, their dynamic is strictly logistical — “drop-offs, pick-ups, school events.”Any lingering personal connection, it seems, has withered since the newsletter’s release.Adding fuel to the fire is the fact that Bündchen recently welcomed her third child — her first with boyfriend Joaquim Valente. While Brady’s newsletter attempted to redefine what fatherhood looks like from his perspective, Bündchen is said to be focused on building a “peaceful” and emotionally fulfilling new chapter. The couple, often spotted on romantic getaways, has sparked wedding speculation in recent months.Despite the apparent tension, Bündchen isn’t fighting fire with fire. Instead, she’s channeling her energy into her new life, quietly sharing glimpses of her joy — including a sweet Mother’s Day Instagram post featuring her baby. The message is clear: while Brady writes about being a great dad, Bündchen is simply living it — and for some, that says more than any newsletter ever could.Also Read: “Aggression all the time”: Gisele Bündchen’s concussion claim raised new questions about Tom Brady’s health and NFL transparency","Sources say Gisele Bundchen felt slighted by Tom Brady's comments on fatherhood.

Why Triple H was at the White House for the fitness initiative

The role of Trump–McMahon ties in shaping Triple H’s invitation

Paul “Triple H” Levesque stirred the pot on social media over the last few days when he was unexpectedly spotted in the White House, and fans began to ask why the WWE exec was at a political event. Some of it is official duties, but much of it is personal history. During the announcement and signing of an executive order to restore the Presidential Fitness Test and to further develop the President's Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition, Triple H stood next to President Trump on August 1, 2025.The official reason for Triple H being at the White House today was his addition to the newly announced President's Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition. He was chosen, along with other notable athletes and sports figures, to support the administration's emphasis on physical fitness in schools as WWE's Chief Content Officer and a name everyone recognizes. This initiative aims to reestablish organized exercise testing in public schools and promote better living amongst American children.His appearance wasn’t just symbolic. Triple H joined in the playful moments between segments, spitting water into the crowd in his signature fashion model, as well as rapping to the time of his own voice, and discussing fitness, and particularly the need for it to be instilled in youth. The star power and cultural influence of Michael Jordan was excellent choice as he was able to become the face of the sports and entertainment community in this effort.Also Read: Why is Triple H at the White House? WWE icon joins Trump to revive school fitness tests As to Triple H himself, while his official role on the fitness council legitimizes his appearance, he is also very closely connected with the Trump administration via the McMahon family. He is also the son-in-law of Linda McMahon, a longtime WWE executive and a Trump political insider. Linda was the head of the Small Business Administration during Trump’s first term; she now has the job of Secretary of Education.The relationship between the McMahon family and Trump runs deep, dating to the 1980s, when Trump properties were host to WWE events. Donald Trump has been on WWE programming a number of times, including in a prominent WrestleMania storyline in 2007. The peer knew at one point who he was taking that leap into the end of WWE with, he even got inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. It's possible that these longstanding personal and business ties contributed in the background to make Triple H the thing that came to mind comfortably at the event.","WWE exec Paul ""Triple H"" Levesque was unexpectedly spotted in the White House.

Workers at a former US nuclear weapons facility in South Carolina have uncovered a radioactive wasp nest emitting radiation levels ten times higher than regulatory limits, reports the BBC.Routine radiation checks at the Savannah River site near Aiken discovered a wasp nest early July, positioned on a post near tanks storing liquid nuclear waste.""The wasp nest was sprayed to kill wasps, then bagged as radiological waste,"" according to a US Department of Energy report released last week.Officials said that no wasps were found at the site near Aiken, South Carolina. They confirmed that the waste tanks are not leaking, and currently, there are no wasps present at the site.""No contamination was found in the area,"" the report confirmed. ""There were no impacts to workers, the environment or the public,""Investigators believe the dangerously high radiation levels found on the nest are the result of ""onsite legacy radioactive contamination"", residual radiation left behind from the site's Cold War-era operations, when it was actively involved in producing components for nuclear weapons, reports the BBC.While the nest showed high radiation levels, the wasps that once occupied it would have carried significantly lower levels of radiation, the report said.The report says that wasps usually don’t travel far from their nest—just a few hundred feet. Since the nest was found inside the 310-square-mile facility, it’s unlikely that the wasps flew outside the site.The Savannah River site originally began operations in the 1950s and produced plutonium for nuclear bomb cores. The site remains active to this day focusing on nuclear materials for power generation.The site originally produced over 625 million liters of liquid nuclear waste, which has since been reduced to approximately 29 million liters through evaporation. Currently, 43 underground tanks remain in use, while eight have been closed, as per the Savannah River Mission Completion.","Routine radiation checks at the Savannah River site near Aiken discovered a wasp nest early July.

Trump's fund cuts: CPB to shut down after GOP slashes funding; 'trashed decades of democracy' say critics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-fund-cuts-cpb-to-shut-down-after-gop-slashes-funding-trashed-decades-of-democracy-say-critics/articleshow/123054969.cms,"



The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) announced that it would be winding down its operations on Friday, in a major victory for Republican lawmakers.This follows a successful effort to defund local PBS and NPR stations across the United States.The decision comes just over a week after US President Donald Trump signed a rescissions bill that clawed back $9 billion in previously approved federal funding, including $1.1 billion earmarked for CPB over the next two years.“Despite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations,” said CPB President and CEO Patricia Harrison.“CPB remains committed to fulfilling its fiduciary responsibilities and supporting our partners through this transition with transparency and care.”Founded over six decades ago, the CPB has long served as the funding backbone for public broadcasters across the country. With its dissolution, officials are now working to help local stations grapple with sudden financial shortfalls. Harrison has particularly warned that smaller, rural stations could be forced to shut down entirely without federal assistance.Larger stations, which often have more diversified funding streams including public donations, may fare better. Nonetheless, public media leaders argue that the entire ecosystem will suffer without CPB’s foundational support.“The ripple effects of this closure will be felt across every public media organisation and, more importantly, in every community across the country that relies on public broadcasting,” said NPR CEO Katherine Maher in a statement ctied by CNN.Nearly all of the corporation’s 100 staff roles will be eliminated when funding officially ends on 30 September. A small transition team will stay on through January to ensure “a responsible and orderly closeout of operations,” the CPB said.The move represents a political milestone for Trump, who has long campaigned to strip public broadcasting of federal support. Earlier this year, he even attempted, unsuccessfully, to dismiss three members of the CPB board, despite having no legal authority to do so under the legislation that established the organisation in 1967, CNN reported.Although the corporation initially took legal action to defend its board members, it filed a voluntary dismissal of the case on Friday—an implicit acknowledgment that the administration has won.“REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED DOING THIS FOR 40 YEARS, AND FAILED….BUT NO MORE,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, following the approval of the bill in both the Republican-controlled House and Senate.While public media advocates had held out hope that Congress might restore funding through the normal appropriations process, a draft Senate bill advanced on Thursday without any such provision, effectively shutting the door on a last-minute rescue.For Trump and his Republican allies, the elimination of CPB is a strike against what they perceive as liberal bias within public broadcasting.But for media advocates, it marks the end of an era, one that saw the federal government play a crucial role in sustaining non-commercial TV and radio.“The end of CPB is the direct result of the deep and corrupt failure of Congress and the Trump administration to invest in informing the American public,” said Craig Aaron, co-CEO of the progressive media reform group Free Press. “They have trashed decades of democracy-building work and will deny many journalists, artists, educators and creators the opportunity to be heard.”Aaron, however, held out hope for the future, suggesting the crisis could spur the rebirth of publicly funded media “as a bulwark against authoritarianism that meets the civic needs of all our communities.”",The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) announced that it would be winding down its operations on Friday.

Humanitarian cost of the war





In a sweeping diplomatic shift, several key allies of the United States are now preparing to formally recognise Palestine as a sovereign state.This development will increase global pressure on Israel and change how the world views Palestinian statehood.In 1988, India became one of the first countries to recognise the State of Palestine.So far, 147 of the 193 United Nations member states recognise Palestine as a state. That number is expected to grow, with France, Britain and Canada — three close US allies and key global players — announcing plans to join the list in the coming months.Among Nato’s 32 member countries, 14 already recognise a Palestinian state. If Britain, France and Canada follow through, that number will rise to 17. Within the G20, 10 countries currently extend recognition. The latest announcements would push this total to 13.India was one of the first countries to recognise the State of Palestine after its declaration in 1988. Even earlier, in 1974, India had recognised the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the only legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, showing its long-standing support for the Palestinian cause.India is set to take part in a UN high-level conference on the peaceful settlement of the Palestine issue and the two-state solution. So far, 123 countries and organisations have signed up for the three-day meeting starting Monday. The event will be co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia.France confirmed it would extend recognition by September, while Britain has tied its decision to whether Israel agrees to a ceasefire with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.If Britain and France formalise their decisions, the United States will be the only permanent member of the UN Security Council that does not recognise Palestine. China and Russia already do.Canada is set to formally recognise the State of Palestine in September 2025 during the United Nations General Assembly, as announced by Prime Minister Mark Carney.Carney said that worsening humanitarian conditions in Gaza and continued settlement expansion have made the two-state solution untenable without international action. US President Donald Trump has expressed disapproval, warning that if Canada joins the line of countries supporting Palestine, it may become harder for the country to continue trade with its neighbour.Also read: 'Very hard for us': Trump targets Canada over recognising Palestine statehood; warns of trade deal risk In a historic shift, all 22 Arab League nations have jointly called on Hamas to end its rule in Gaza, give up its weapons, and release hostages. This was announced at a high-level UN conference in New York focused on achieving a two-state solution.The Arab League statement was backed by all 27 European Union countries and 17 other nations. It called for a “temporary international stabilisation mission” in Gaza, under the invitation of the Palestinian Authority and supervised by the United Nations.The UN conference, co-sponsored by France and Saudi Arabia, brought together delegates from 125 countries. The resulting “New York Declaration” outlines a phased roadmap for ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. UN member states have until the General Assembly session in September to endorse it.Australia, Finland, Malta, Portugal and New Zealand have also expressed interest in recognising Palestine before the upcoming UN General Assembly.Hamas responded by welcoming international support for Palestinian rights but called for “unconditional international recognition” of statehood. It did not directly address the Arab League’s call to disarm. “The Palestinian situation is an internal affair of our people,” the group said.Israel’s ongoing military campaign in Gaza has reportedly killed more than 58,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Nearly 2 million people are now facing extreme hunger and hardship. The Israeli assault began in response to Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.Both Israel and the United States have criticised the push for recognition, saying it rewards Hamas and undermines current ceasefire negotiations.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other leaders warn that international recognition efforts threaten Israeli security. Hamas, for its part, denounced calls for regional normalisation with Israel, saying such efforts “reward the enemy for its crimes.”","147 of the 193 United Nations member states recognise Palestine as a state.

Devil’s Den murders row: Former teacher a 'monster’; tickled little girls and gave 'lot of special treatment',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/devils-den-murders-row-former-teacher-a-monster-tickled-little-girls-and-gave-lot-of-special-treatment/articleshow/123054374.cms,"



A former primary school teacher accused of brutally murdering a married couple in front of their two daughters at Devil’s Den State Park in Arkansas had previously displayed alarming behaviour towards young girls at a school in Texas, a concerned parent has claimed.Andrew James McGann, 28, is accused of stabbing Clinton David Brink, 43, and Cristen Amanda Brink, 41, to death on Saturday, while their daughters, aged 9 and 7, fled the scene unharmed.Authorities said McGann later confessed to the killing and was charged with capital murder following a five-day manhunt.In an interview with New York Post on Friday, Zacharri Polyak, whose son attended Donald Elementary School in Flower Mound, Texas, when McGann was a teacher there, alleged deeply troubling past behaviour.“This monster was around our children,” he said. Polyak recalled that McGann once put a little girl on his lap and said “things like, ‘I wish I could date you, I wish you could be my girlfriend,’ just really nasty like grooming behavior.”He also claimed McGann showed “a lot of special treatment to girls in particular,” adding, “He was giving them candy, bringing them Sonic drinks, playing tag with them, tickling them, just really suspect behavior.”Lewisville Independent school district, which oversees Donald Elementary, told New York Post that McGann was placed on administrative leave during the 2022–2023 academic year “following concerns related to classroom management, professional judgement, and student favoritism.”However, the district said an internal investigation “found no evidence of inappropriate behavior with students.” McGann resigned in May 2023.Polyak criticised the school’s response, “It should have been an immediate firing with reports to Child Protective Services,” he said.Another parent, Sierra Marcum, whose son was in McGann’s fourth-grade class, described him as distant and disengaged. “[He was] pretty cold. You could ask him a question, and he would give you a one-word response,” she told WFAA.“Overall, just pretty disinterested in his students.”Marcum said she raised concerns with the school after her son came home visibly upset. “Eventually, he told me that he and some other classmates had noticed that Mr. McGann was very touchy and showed a lot of favoritism to certain girls in the class,” she said. “I guess [the murder allegations] did surprise me, because while I thought he was off, I never thought he was violent.”McGann was later hired for the 2023–2024 school year at Spring Creek Elementary in Oklahoma. The district said McGann passed all legally mandated national background checks, and there had been no disciplinary issues during his time there.He had also secured a job at Springdale Public Schools in Arkansas, where he was due to start teaching in a week. Superintendent Jared Cleveland confirmed McGann’s hiring, but stressed that he “has not at any time come into contact with Springdale students or the families we serve,” according to 5 News.The shocking murders took place on a hiking trail in the Arkansas state park. Authorities say McGann ambushed the Brink couple, stabbing them to death while their daughters escaped and raised the alarm. He was eventually located and arrested mid-haircut at a local barbershop.McGann appeared in court on Friday (local time) and was ordered to be held without bail. Investigators have not yet established a motive for the killings.","Andrew James McGann, 28, is accused of stabbing a married couple to death in front of their two daughters.

"Washington mansion killings: 15-year-old 'killed' parents, siblings; was raised in ‘militant survivalist’ home",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/washington-mansion-killings-15-year-old-killed-parents-siblings-was-raised-in-militant-survivalist-home/articleshow/123053591.cms,"



A 15-year-old boy accused of murdering nearly his entire family in their $2 million lakeside mansion in suburban Seattle was raised under a “rigid, militant survivalist ideology” and kept isolated from the outside world, according to new court documents filed last week.Prosecutors allege that the teenager, whose identity remains protected due to his age, fatally shot his parents, Mark and Sarah Humiston, as well as his siblings Benjamin, 13, Joshua, 9, and Katheryn, 7, in the early hours of a morning in October last year.Only his 11-year-old sister survived after pretending to be dead when he shot her in the neck and hand. She managed to escape through a window and ran to a neighbour’s home for help.Court filings, obtained by KOMO News, suggest the family lived an extremely secluded and controlled life shaped by religious extremism and deep distrust of government and medical authorities.“A common theme that has been expressed amongst extended family, neighbors, and those who knew the Humistons is that the children were isolated from the outside world and did not engage socially with many peers – only a select few families that went to their church and were friends of their family,” the documents said, as cited by the New York Post.“Furthermore, initial reports indicate the home was abusive, tightly controlled, and dominated by extreme religious beliefs.”The children were homeschooled, and the entire family reportedly adhered to a rigid lifestyle based on survivalist values. The Humistons were described as intensely paranoid about government interference, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and harboured deep mistrust of medical professionals, especially in relation to the vaccine.According to the defence team, all the children had access to firearms, and it was Mark Humiston’s own handgun that the teenager used to carry out the massacre. Charging documents claim he opened fire at around 5 am, methodically checking the pulses of his victims after shooting them, New York Post reported.Despite the brutality of the attack, nearly 100 interviews with family members and acquaintances painted the boy as “kind, respectful, and deeply devoted to his family.”Even his maternal grandmother expressed sympathy for the accused, reportedly telling investigators that Sarah Humiston “was abusive and demeaning to the children,” and that she had once threatened to report the parents for alleged mistreatment.In an apparent effort to mislead investigators, the boy called 911 after the killings and claimed his 13-year-old brother had shot the family before killing himself after being caught viewing pornography the night before. He is said to have staged the crime scene to support this narrative, even placing the murder weapon in his brother’s hand before first responders arrived.The teen was arrested at the scene and now faces five counts of first-degree aggravated murder and one count of first-degree attempted murder.",15-year-old accused of murdering his entire family in their $2 million lakeside mansion in suburban Seattle.

'Too late Powell': Trump calls out Fed chief on interest rates; demands Jerome to step down after Kugler exits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/too-late-powell-trump-calls-out-fed-chief-on-interest-rates-demands-jerome-to-step-down-after-kugler-exits/articleshow/123053526.cms,"



Donald Trump has called on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to resign, intensifying his attacks on the central bank’s leadership after Fed governor Adriana Kugler announced her early departure.“'Too Late' Powell should resign, just like Adriana Kugler, a Biden Appointee, resigned. She knew he was doing the wrong thing on Interest Rates. He should resign, also!” the US president wrote Friday(local time) on his social media platform, Truth Social.The post follows Trump’s earlier attacks on Powell, where he called him “too stupid” and “too political” for the job. “Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell has done it again!!! He is TOO LATE, and actually, TOO ANGRY, TOO STUPID, & TOO POLITICAL, to have the job of Fed Chair,” he wrote.Trump further accused Powell of costing the country “TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS, in addition to one of the most incompetent, or corrupt, renovations of a building(s) in the history of construction,” adding, “Put another way, ‘Too Late’ is a TOTAL LOSER, and our Country is paying the price!”These comments follow the Federal Reserve’s decision to hold interest rates steady for a fifth straight meeting, despite his repeated demands for aggressive cuts.Trump has consistently argued that inflation is overstated and that slashing rates would stimulate growth, benefit homebuyers and ease the federal budget. However, the Fed’s preferred inflation metric is currently running at 2.6% annually, above its 2% target, and many economists warn that deep rate cuts could stoke inflation further.Fed governor Adriana Kugler, appointed by Joe Biden, also announced her resignation today, effective 8 August. This resignation came several months before her term was due to end in January 2026.Speaking to reporters, Trump claimed Kugler’s resignation was tied to disagreements over interest rates.“I understand it was over the fact that she disagreed with somebody from her party …she disagreed with ‘Too Late’ on the interest rate,” he said, as quoted by CNN.However, Trump said he was “very happy” to have an open seat on the Fed Board.","Donald Trump has called on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to resign.

Hundreds gathered at a New York mosque on Thursday to commemorate a Bangladesh-born police officer who lost his life protecting his adopted city when a shooter attacked an office building this week.Officer Didarul Islam ""did believe in the American dream, not as something handed down but as something built with your own hands,"" Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch addressed Islam's community as officers stood in formation outside the Bronx religious centre.Officials and New York's Bangladeshi community members gathered to honour the deceased officer during a service that highlighted his dedication to family, heritage and public service.The 36-year-old officer, a married father of two expecting a third child, was conducting an NYPD-approved private security assignment in uniform when he and three others were fatally shot Monday at the Manhattan high-rise housing the NFL's headquarters and various corporate offices.""To our family, he was our world. To the city, he was a proud NYPD officer who served with compassion and integrity.

Docus that hint at Hillary role in plan to tie Trump to Russia false?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/docus-that-hint-at-hillary-role-in-plan-to-tie-trump-to-russia-false/articleshow/123052613.cms,"



The Trump-era special counsel who scoured the Russia investigation for wrongdoing gathered evidence that undermines a theory pushed by some Republicans that Hillary Clinton 's campaign conspired to frame Donald Trump for colluding with Moscow in the 2016 election, information declassified on Thursday shows.The information, a 29-page annex to the special counsel's 2023 report, reveals that a foundational document for that theory was most likely stitched together by Russian spies. The document is a purported email from July 27, 2016, that said Hillary had approved a campaign proposal to tie Trump to Russia to distract from the scandal over her use of a private email server.The release of the annex adds new details to the public's understanding of a complex trove of 2016 Russian intelligence reports analysing purported emails that Russian hackers stole from Americans. It also shows how the special counsel, John Durham, went to great lengths to try to prove that several of the emails were real, only to ultimately conclude otherwise.The release of the annex was no exception. John Ratcliffe, the CIA director, said in a statement that the materials proved that suspicions of Russian collusion stemmed from ""a coordinated plan to prevent and destroy Donald Trump's presidency.""Kash Patel, the FBI director, declared on social media that the annex revealed ""evidence that the Clinton campaign plotted to frame President Trump and fabricate the Russia collusion hoax.""In reality, the annex shows the opposite, indicating that a key piece of supposed evidence for the claim that Hillary approved a plan to tie Trump to Russia is not credible: Durham concluded that the email from July 27, 2016, and a related one dated two days earlier were probably manufactured.Before the 2020 election, Ratcliffe, as director of national intelligence in Trump's first term, had declassified and released the crux of the July 27 email, even though he acknowledged doubts about its credibility. Officials did ""not know the accuracy of this allegation or the extent to which the Russian intelligence analysis may reflect exaggeration or fabrication,"" he said. Among some Trump supporters, the message became known as the ""Clinton Plan intelligence,"" as Durham put it in his final report.In his report, Durham used the US govt's knowledge of the supposed plan, via the Russian memos, to criticise FBI officials involved in the Russia investigation for not being more sceptical when they later received a copy of the Steele dossier and used it to obtain a wiretap order. Durham's report also mentioned that Clinton and others in the campaign dismissed the allegation as ridiculous. But Durham banished to the annex concrete details he had found that bolstered her campaign's rebuttal, burying until now the conclusion that the email he called the ""Clinton Plan intelligence"" was Russian disinformation.Durham was never able to prove any Clinton campaign conspiracy to frame Trump by spreading information that it knew to be false, but he used court filings to insinuate such suspicions. He brought charges of false statements against two people involved in efforts to scrutinize possible ties between Trump and Russia, which ended in acquittals.","A 29-page annex to the special counsel's 2023 report reveals that a foundational document for that theory was most likely stitched together by Russian spies.

The federal govt is suspending certain research funding to the University of California at Los Angeles, citing concerns about antisemitism and bias on campus, according UCLA chancellor Julio Frenk.In a message to students and staff, Frenk said the freeze could affect hundreds of grants from agencies including the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. He called the decision a blow to researchers and the broader public who benefit from their work in areas such as medical innovation and space exploration. ""This far-reaching penalty of de-funding life-saving research does nothing to address any alleged discrimination,"" Frenk said in the message on Thursday. The Los Angeles Times reported that the suspended grants are worth roughly $200 million.The funding freeze follows a federal investigation that found UCLA violated federal civil rights laws by failing to address antisemitic harassment on campus. This week, the department of justice's civil rights division said the university acted with ""deliberate indifference"" to reports of abuse targeting Jewish and Israeli students since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and the ensuing conflict.

Four people were killed Friday morning when a gunman opened fire at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, Montana, before fleeing the scene and prompting a massive manhunt and town-wide lockdown by afternoon.The Montana Division of Criminal Investigation confirmed the shooting occurred around 10.30 am. All four victims were pronounced dead at the scene.Authorities swiftly launched a search operation, concentrating efforts in the nearby Stump Town area west of Anaconda, reported AP. More than a dozen local and state law enforcement officers, supported by helicopters, drones, and K9 units, joined the manhunt.The suspect, identified as Michael Paul Brown, lived next door to the bar and his home was cleared by a Swat team shortly after the incident.45-year-old Michael Paul Brown, also known as ""Mike,"" is a resident of Anaconda. He was reportedly last seen wearing a tie-dyed shirt, blue jeans, and an orange bandana.Authorities say Brown is believed to be armed with a .762-caliber assault rifle and was last seen driving a 2007 white Ford F-150 pickup truck with Montana license plate DTY493.

58-year era ends: Corporation for Public Broadcasting to close after Trump pulls funding; $1.1 billion cut by Congress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/58-year-era-ends-corporation-for-public-broadcasting-to-close-after-trump-pulls-funding-1-1-billion-cut-by-congress/articleshow/123051766.cms,"From 'Sesame Street' to silence (Image credits: AP)

Local stations, iconic programming face fallout





The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), a pillar of American media for nearly six decades, announced Friday that it will begin a formal shutdown process following the complete loss of federal funding by the Trump administration. The decision comes after Congress rescinded $1.1 billion in appropriations for the next two budget years, effectively eliminating the organization's lifeline.“This marks the end of a historic era in which public broadcasting played an essential role in shaping America’s cultural and educational landscape,” said Patricia Harrison, CPB’s president and CEO.“Despite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations,” she added as quoted by AP.The move was driven by US President Trump, who has long targeted public broadcasting, labeling the CPB a “monstrosity” and accusing it of promoting cultural and political narratives he considers “un-American.” His administration has also shut down other publicly funded media institutions, including Voice of America, and in April, Trump dismissed three CPB board members in what they described as a politically motivated overreach.The senate appropriations committee reinforced the funding cut on Thursday by excluding CPB from its annual budget bill for the first time in more than 50 years. Democratic lawmakers made a final push to restore funding, but the effort fell short. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) offered, then withdrew, an amendment to reinstate funds, saying she would continue working to ""fix this before there are devastating consequences. ""In response, senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said, “We litigated this two weeks ago. Adopting this amendment would have been contrary to what we have already voted on.”Founded in 1967 and signed into law by former President Lyndon B Johnson, CPB has funded more than 1,500 public radio and TV stations, especially in small and rural communities. It has supported iconic programming such as “Sesame Street,” “Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,” NPR’s “All Things Considered,” and the documentaries of Ken Burns. It also plays a critical role in delivering emergency alerts and public safety communications across the country.Most of CPB’s funding has gone directly to local stations, including 330 PBS and 246 NPR affiliates. Roughly 70% of federal funding is distributed at the local level. NPR president and CEO Katherine Maher recently noted that about 96% of classical music broadcasts in the US air on public radio stations- programming that may now be in jeopardy.As part of its shutdown, CPB informed staff on Friday that most positions will end by September 30, the close of the fiscal year. A small transition team will stay on through January to manage final operations, including music licensing and royalty agreements.“Public media has been one of the most trusted institutions in American life, providing educational opportunity, emergency alerts, civil discourse, and cultural connection to every corner of the country,” Harrison said as quoted by AP.“We are deeply grateful to our partners across the system for their resilience, leadership, and unwavering dedication to serving the American people.”","The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) announced Friday that it will begin a formal shutdown process following the complete loss of federal funding.

'Her jeans, her story': American Eagle refuses to apologize







Vice president JD Vance waded into the Sydney Sweeney controversy of the American Eagle's campaign and said Democrats are calling Nazis everyone who thinks Sydney Sweeney is beautiful. ""Great strategy, guys. That's how you're going to win the midterm, especially young American men,"" JD Vance joked during an episode of the conservative ""Ruthless"" podcast. ""My political advice to the Democrats is continue to (call) everybody who thinks Sydney Sweeney is attractive a Nazi,"" he said, laughing the row off.The campaign drew massive flak after playing with 'genes' and 'Jeans'.

""My jeans are blue,"" she said, triggering row that the ad was glorifying good genes.""I actually thought that one of the lessons (Democrats) might take is 'we're going to be less crazy.' And the lesson they have apparently taken is 'we're going to attack people as Nazis for thinking Sydney Sweeney is beautiful,'"" he said on the podcast. ""Great strategy, guys. That's how you're going to win the midterm, especially young American men.""American Eagle issued a statement addressing the controversy and the comparison with Nazi ideas.

Pak flaunts China ties as Trump’s tariff adds new twist to regional dynamics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-flaunts-china-ties-as-trumps-tariff-adds-new-twist-to-regional-dynamics/articleshow/123049829.cms,".

ISLAMABAD:





In a symbolic assertion of strategic alignment, Pakistan’s military hosted on Friday a grand ceremony at General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi to mark the 98th anniversary of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA), showcasing its deepening defence partnership with Beijing.The event came soon after a surprise 19% tariff on Pakistani imports announced by US President Donald Trump just days after Washington and Islamabad concluded new trade deals.While the tariff decision is believed to have been discussed between the two sides as part of broader trade negotiations, Trump’s typically blunt commentary on social media appeared aimed more at India than Pakistan. In recent days, Trump has taken jabs at New Delhi over its continued purchase of Russian oil and defence equipment, while casting Pakistan in a more favourable light.At GHQ, however, Pakistan’s military made its strategic loyalties unambiguous. Army Chief Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir hosted Chinese ambassador Jiang Zaidong and PLA defence attaché Maj Gen Wang Zhong at a ceremony that included military tributes, visuals of joint defence hardware, and strong political messaging. Munir described the Pakistan-China relationship as a “beacon of mutual trust and shared destiny” and referred to the PLA and Pakistan Army as “iron brothers”.The messaging was clear: Pakistan is reaffirming its long-standing alignment with China even as it navigates transactional ties with Washington and economic turbulence at home. With IMF conditionalities tightening and Western funding streams growing unpredictable, Islamabad continues to anchor itself in Beijing’s strategic orbit, particularly through projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).For China, the event was a diplomatic win. As Beijing faces intensifying rivalry with the US across the Indo-Pacific, its deepening influence over a nuclear-armed ally in South Asia reinforces its foothold in the region. The GHQ ceremony was a visual and political endorsement of China’s role as Islamabad’s primary defence and development partner.With Pakistan and China enhancing defence cooperation and projecting unity, New Delhi faces a more tightly aligned northern bloc just as it expands its own security ties with the US and with Indo-Pacific allies.Despite the potential economic fallout of the US tariffs, Rawalpindi appears undeterred. In an era of fluid alliances, Pakistan is betting on consistency with Beijing over the unpredictability of Western partners, a gamble that could reshape the regional balance in the years ahead.",Pakistan hosted ceremony to mark 98th anniversary of China's People's Liberation Army.
