Fan fight turns fatal: Patiala man kills his only son on grandchild’s birthday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/fan-fight-turns-fatal-patiala-man-kills-his-only-son-on-grandchilds-birthday/articleshow/122921885.cms,"



PATIALA: A man allegedly killed his son after an argument over a pedestal fan at Mallewal village near here on July 23 night, orphaning one of his grandsons on his birthday.Jagpal Singh (35) died of head injuries after being attacked by his father, Malkeet Singh (65), with a sharp farming tool. According to police, the incident occurred shortly after the family had gathered to celebrate the birthday of Jagpal's son. The dispute reportedly started over the pedestal fan being without a protective mesh.Jagpal had asked his father to switch off the fan while stepping out, expressing concern that a child might accidentally put their hand in it. The disagreement escalated, and both retired to their rooms later that night. Police revealed that Jagpal had two sons, aged 5 and 2.Police said Malkeet, allegedly under the influence of alcohol, entered his son's room while he was asleep and struck him three times on the head with a sickle-like tool. Jagpal was first taken to the civil hospital in Nabha and later referred to PGIMER, Chandigarh, in a critical condition, where he died during treatment.The SHO of Bhadson police station, Gurpreet Singh, said they had registered a case against Malkeet based on statements from family members. ""The incident took place on July 23 night. A day before murder, arguments took place between the duo, but they were pacified by the neighbours and family members. Jagpal was the only son of Malkeet. He is survived by two sons and his wife. An investigation is underway,"" said the SHO.Jagpal's mother expressed deep anguish over the incident and said her husband destroyed their family with his own hands. A relative, Beant Singh, called the act shameful and inexcusable.","Jagpal Singh (35) died of head injuries after being attacked by his father, Malkeet Singh (65), with a sharp farming tool.

Trump Defied? Cambodia Accuses Thailand Of Fresh Attacks Amid Trump Truce Call

US president Donald Trump on Sunday once again brought up the India-Pakistan ceasefire, this time while speaking about the situation between Thailand and Cambodia.Trump said the US does a lot of trade with both Thailand and Cambodia. He claimed he personally called the prime ministers of both countries and warned them that no trade deal would move forward unless they stopped the fighting.“This should be an easy one for me because I settled India and Pakistan,” Trump said, repeating a claim he has made several times in the past. “By the time I got off the call, I think they want to settle now.”He added that India and Pakistan were “really getting ready to go at it” back when he intervened. “If I can use trade to settle wars, then it’s my honour,” he said.","Trump said the US does a lot of trade with both Thailand and Cambodia.

Oppn plans to point to big terror attacks under ‘PM Modi’s watch’

GANGAIKONDA CHOLAPURAM/NEW DELHI: A day ahead of the parliamentary debate on the Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor , PM Narendra Modi on Sunday reasserted that the precision strikes on terror dens in Pakistan was India's message that there are no safe havens for terrorists and their masters.India places the highest priority on its national security and the operation has created a new awakening and a new self-confidence across the country, Modi said at an event in Tamil Nadu's Gangaikonda Cholapuram to honour Chola emperor Rajendra Chola.The world witnessed India's firm and decisive response to the threat against its sovereignty during Operation Sindoor and it has sent a clear message, there is no safe haven for terrorists and enemies of the nation, he said, setting the tone for the govt's response for the debate in Parliament, starting in Lok Sabha on Monday.The upcoming discussion in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on the attack and the operation comes as a significant opportunity for the govt to reaffirm its strong stance on national security and counter-terrorism.The debate - after a first week of disruption of Parliament's Monsoon session - is likely to be a fiery one between the ruling alliance and the opposition as they prepare to lock horns over the issues steeped in national security and foreign policy imperatives.The two sides have consented to a marathon 16-hour debate in each House, which invariably stretches longer in practice. Union defence minister Rajnath Singh is likely to initiate the debate immediately after the question hour in Lok Sabha.Sources said home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, and external affairs minister S Jaishankar will be speaking on the issues amid indications that the PM may make an intervention to convey his govt's ""robust"" stand against terrorism Leaders of opposition in LS and RS - Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge - may lead the charge against the govt along with Samajwadi Party's Akhilesh Yadav, besides a host of others. Congress , however, plans to attack the govt and particularly PM Modi on what BJP has claimed to be their calling card over a decade, and have used incessantly to target Congress over national security.More than Operation Sindoor, the opposition would be looking to hammer home that the country has been extremely unsafe from cross border threats, pointing to repeated big terror attacks under Modi's watch, from Uri to Pahalgam. This will also put Shah in the oppositions crosshairs.It is here that the opposition plans to undercut Modi's claim on national security. As has been seen since the terror attack, Congress and opposition have been pointing to the fact that the terrorists singled out the tourists by religion to execute them - a point that the opposition would have been reluctant to touch in the past for fear of polarisation.Congress ahead of the debate raised the issue of US President Donald Trump's claims of halting Operation Sindoor. Party leader Jairam Ramesh on Sunday said since May 10, Trump has claimed ""26 times"" that he stopped the operation by ""threatening to cut off trade with India, and claimed that five fighter jets may have been shot down"".Ramesh on X said ""even though Congress had been demanding a special two-day session of Parliament immediately after Operation Sindoor was abruptly halted that demand was ignored.

MUMBAI/NAGPUR: Amid speculation about an alliance between Shiv Sena (UBT) and MNS for the civic polls, Raj Thackeray made a rare visit to Matoshree, Uddhav Thackeray's residence, to wish his ""big brother"" on his 65th birthday. Uddhav welcomed Raj with a hug, while the latter presented him a bouquet of red roses. After the courtesies, the cousins spoke for close to 20 minutes. Raj also paid tributes to his late uncle Bal Thackeray's memorial chair on the first floor at Matoshree.Since parting ways with Shiv Sena two decades ago, Raj has visited Matoshree just a couple of times, the last time in 2019 to invite Uddhav to his son's wedding.In what's seen as a snub to deputy CM and Shiv Sena chief Eknath Shinde, Raj later referred to Uddhav as ""Shiv Sena chief"" on X.While political observers said the two cousins meeting second time in less than a month is an indication of a political reunion for the local body polls slated for Nov-Dec, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis downplayed it, terming the visit purely personal.""Raj Thackeray met Uddhav on account of his birthday. I don't think one should see a political angle in everything,"" said Fadnavis, while speaking to reporters in Nagpur.Responding to an earlier remark on the possibility of the alliance by Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut that ""whatever is in the mind of Maharashtra will ultimately happen"", Fadnavis said, ""I feel there is something only in the mind of certain leaders. Else, what's in the mind of Maharashtra we got to know during [assembly] polls.""Speaking briefly to the media after Raj's visit, Uddhav appeared visibly emotional. ""I am very happy. I am overwhelmed...,"" he said, declining to elaborate.Later, Raj said in a post on X: ""On the occasion of my big brother, Shiv Sena chief, Uddhav Thackeray's birthday, I visited Matoshree, the residence of the late Balasaheb Thackeray, to extend my best wishes."" Raj's reference to Uddhav as Shiv Sena chief was also a snub to deputy chief minister Ekanth Shinde, who is president of the Shiv Sena officially recognised by the Election Commission (EC) after the party split.Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut and MLC Ambadas Danve and MNS netas Bala Nandgaonkar and Nitin Sardesai were among those present during Raj's visit to Matoshree, which was decked up with flowers and banners to mark Uddhav's birthday. At midnight, Uddhav cut a cake with wife Rashmi and son Aaditya amid sloganeering in a room packed with Sainiks.""All together, No problem at all!"" Raut said in a post on X, sharing a group photo with Raj and Uddhav.""Both the brothers did it without saying a word. This is the beginning of the future. This incident united the divided Maharashtra, there cannot be a happier day like today. Therefore, today is a day of joy and inspiration for the Marathi people,"" Sena (UBT) MLA Bhaskar Jadhav said.Political observers said Raj's visit to Matoshree was a reciprocal step to Uddhav's comments that the two cousins had ""come together to be together"" during the July 5 'victory rally' in Mumbai after state govt withdrew its decision to introduce Hindi from classes 1 to 5.""At the July 5 rally itself Uddhav had said that the two cousins have come together to stay together. Later too, Uddhav made it clear that an alliance was on the cards in his interviews and speeches. So, Raj seems to have taken a step forward by visiting him,"" said a political observer. ""Raj going to Matoshree also has sentimental value for Shiv Sainiks; it is a kind of homecoming. In fact, it has more optical and sentimental value than the two cousins coming together at the rally at Worli's NSCI Dome. In the minds of the Sainiks, Matoshree has sanctity and Raj going there is also an acceptance on his part of Uddhav as a big brother and Sena (UBT) president. With this visit, Raj has kept the momentum alive and not let the curiosity of the reunion die down after the Hindi imposition issue.""","MNS chief Raj Thackeray makes rare visit to cousin Uddhav's home.

PUNE: In a seven-hour operation on Saturday, forest staffers and locals rescued 300 trekkers, including 100 women, after they were left stranded in the forest at Malshej Ghat where the level of the Kalu river increased because of rainfall measuring 200mm in three hours.The incident happened at Waghachi Wadi on the Thane-Pune border, about 150km from Pune city, near the Kalyan-Ahilyanagar highway. The rescue effort commenced at 3pm and continued until 10pm, successfully bringing to safety the trekkers — mostly from Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune.Officials from Thane and Junnar forest divisions, who were part of the rescue effort, said most trekkers had arrived early in the morning and had not anticipated the heavy showers or rise in the river water.The state disaster management cell and the district administrations informed the rescuers about the incident after receiving calls for help. The operation was particularly difficult, as locals had to swim through the gushing water to secure ropes and harnesses to trees and use a zipline to transport individuals across the river.Local resident of Morushi village Bhaskar Mengal (24), who was amongst the first to respond to the crisis, said, ""There was no way to reach the trekkers other than to swim through the gushing and rising water.I swam across the river to tie ropes and harness to the trees. The tourists were scared and I had to calm them down. We first rescued the women after explaining how to use a zipline to cross the river and allaying fears about a fall. We sent them across one by one. Later, another villager, Kamlu Pokla, and forest guards joined me.""Range forest officer of Tokavade forest range in Thane district Rajvardhan Bhosale told TOI that the tourists ventured into the restricted dense forest on Saturday morning without consulting the villagers. They were unaware of the local conditions, which led to the situation where the river's water level suddenly rose within a few hours. The area is treacherous and risky for outsiders,"" he added.Meanwhile, Pokla said, ""The stranded trekkers panicked and were hesitant to follow our instructions as it started to turn dark. We had to calm them down before rescuing them from the deep forest.""Forest officials said tourists prefer to approach the Kalu river waterfall from the Murbad tehsil side because the trek to the waterfall is steep. However, the zone is located within a reserved forest area, home to a large population of wildlife, including leopards and venomous snakes.Junnar division's assistant forest officer Smita Rajhans said, ""Visitors from Maharashtra and other states flock to Junnar and surrounding areas for monsoon treks after watching videos on social media. They often disregard their safety and forget to hire locals for guidance. They attempt adventurous activities in dense forest zones leading to difficult situations.""Kalu WaterfallKalu Waterfall is situated in Khireshwar village, Junnar tehsil — which is part of the Malshej Ghat region. It is renowned for its stunning natural beauty and attracts thousands of visitors, especially from Mumbai and Pune, during monsoon. The river cascades from a height of 1,200ft, making it one of the largest waterfalls in the region and district.However, locals have been voicing concerns about protocol at the site, noting that inadequate safety measures have resulted in numerous fatalities. The area is prone to slippery patches and unstable rocks, raising the risk of accidents.

US president Donald Trump 's longtime biographer Michael Wolff has reignited controversy by claiming that Jeffrey Epstein played a key role in introducing Melania Trump to her future husband.Speaking on The Daily Beast podcast, Wolff said Melania was “very involved” in Epstein’s social circle when she was first introduced to Trump in 1998. According to Wolff, the connection was made through Paolo Zampolli, founder of ID Models, who helped Melania move to the US. They met in 1998.“She’s introduced by a model agent, both of whom Trump and Epstein are involved with… Epstein knew her well,” Wolff said. He also questioned Melania’s ties to what he called a “culture of models of indeterminate age.”Melania, however, has denied the Epstein angle. She insists she met Trump at the Kit Kat Klub in New York, where she had gone with a friend. In her book Melania, she describes how Trump, already twice divorced, was there with a date but spent the evening talking to her. “It was a refreshing departure from the usual superficial small talk,” she writes.Despite Trump’s efforts to distance himself from Epstein, a photo from 2000 shows Donald and Melania at Mar-a-Lago alongside Epstein and Maxwell. Epstein himself once claimed that he introduced the couple.Donald Trump’s links to Jeffrey Epstein came to the spotlight after The Wall Street Journal reported that attorney general Pam Bondi told Trump during a May briefing that his name had come up in justice department files connected to Epstein.","Donald Trump's longtime biographer Michael Wolff has reignited controversy by claiming that Jeffrey Epstein played a key role in introducing Melania Trump to her future husband.

Ukraine aid row: EU withholds $1.7 billion; Zelenskyy's new bill faces internal and external pressure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/ukraine-aid-row-eu-withholds-1-7-billion-zelenskyys-new-bill-faces-internal-and-external-pressure/articleshow/122942559.cms,"



The European Union has frozen $1.7 billion in aid earmarked for Ukraine after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a bill that weakens the independence of the country’s top anti-corruption agencies.The withheld amount represents over a third of the funding set aside by the Union under its Ukraine Facility fund, which was launched last year to support Kyiv’s war recovery and its path to EU membership.The move follows what EU officials described as a troubling shift in Ukraine’s governance standards.The legislation in question hands greater authority to the politically appointed Prosecutor General over the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO), two key institutions created in the wake of Ukraine’s 2014 Revolution of Dignity to fight high-level corruption.The decision sparked the first wartime protests against Zelenskyy’s administration, with thousands taking to the streets to demand that the NABU and SAPO remain free from political interference. Under public pressure, Zelenskyy swiftly introduced measures aimed at safeguarding the agencies' independence, but concerns continue to grow.Marta Kos, the EU’s Commissioner for Expansion, warned that Ukraine’s efforts to exert political control over its top anti-corruption bodies had raised “serious concerns” within the bloc, New York Post reported.Although the EU’s freeze on funds is not yet final, Brussels has made it clear that the money will only be released once Ukraine realigns with the bloc’s anti-corruption benchmarks.Zelenskyy has previously pledged to continue Ukraine’s anti-corruption campaign but has grown increasingly critical of the agencies, especially after they began targeting individuals close to his inner circle. Among them is former deputy PM Oleksiy Chernyshov, who was investigated by SAPO.The president initially defended the bill by arguing it was necessary to rid the agencies of “Russian influence” and to address a backlog of unresolved cases. However, that explanation has done little to ease tensions either within Ukraine or among its allies.British prime minister Keir Starmer also reportedly urged Zelenskyy to reconsider the bill and take concrete steps to address governance concerns, as per the New York Post.Further pressure is mounting from the International Monetary Fund, which has tied its $15.6 billion aid package, to be distributed over four years, to Ukraine’s progress on anti-corruption reforms. Kyiv now faces a Thursday deadline to appoint a new head of its Economic Security Bureau in order to maintain eligibility for the IMF programme.Zelenskyy has so far refused to appoint Oleksandr Tsyvinskyi, the official who led the case against Chernyshov, despite a recommendation from an independent commission. The post remains vacant, with no update yet on who might be chosen.As Ukraine continues to fend off Russia’s invasion, the controversy over anti-corruption efforts threatens to undermine both foreign confidence and much-needed financial support.",The withheld amount represents over a third of the funding set aside by the Union under its Ukraine Facility fund. The move follows what EU officials described as a troubling shift in Ukraine’s governance standards. The legislation in question hands greater authority to the politically appointed Prosecutor General over the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU),"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122942696,imgsize-45804,width-400,resizemode-4/122942696.jpg"
‘Market of sweethearts’: Frustration grows over sex trafficking crisis in NYC district; AOC missing in action,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/market-of-sweethearts-frustration-grows-over-sex-trafficking-crisis-in-nyc-district-aoc-missing-in-action/articleshow/122943020.cms,"



Frustration is boiling over in Queens, where residents, business owners, and civic leaders are accusing representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of ignoring worsening conditions along Roosevelt Avenue, a stretch now infamous for rampant prostitution, illegal vending, and growing gang activity.“I have not personally seen Ocasio-Cortez since she’s been elected. I have not seen her in the community,” these were the words of Rosa Sanchez, president of the Restore Roosevelt Avenue Coalition.“I have seen her in a parade — that’s it.”Locals say they've been pleading for help as their community, the infamous “Market of Sweethearts,” spirals into disorder. They claim the congresswoman, who represents a portion of the troubled corridor, has been missing in action.Sanchez said the rise in unlicensed street vendors, some allegedly peddling stolen goods, has put law-abiding shopkeepers on the brink, while victims of sex trafficking are left to suffer without political support. “You have young women held against their will. They’re being sex trafficked. This is not normal,” she said.“Our community is suffering,” she further told the New York Post.Despite a recent NYPD operation, called ""Operation Restore Roosevelt,"" many believe the efforts were only temporary.Though crime dipped 28% during the 90-day crackdown, residents say the relief didn’t last. Within weeks of police scaling back, illegal vendors returned, and the familiar signs of lawlessness reappeared.Mauricio Zamora, leader of the Neighbors of the American Triangle, told the New York Post that the AOC has “never” taken meaningful action on the area’s core issues.After meeting with Ocasio-Cortez last Friday to discuss the crisis at Corona Plaza, Zamora claimed the congresswoman shifted the blame, saying that broader crime enforcement was the responsibility of the mayor, NYPD, and city officials.That response has not satisfied many in the community, especially when other lawmakers are seen taking more proactive stances. Bronx representative Ritchie Torres, for instance, has openly called on Mayor Eric Adams to clean up The Hub, another hotspot plagued by open-air drug use and prostitution.Many Queens residents say that they’ve simply never seen their representative.“No, I have never seen AOC here. I’ve seen the local city councilman [Francisco Moya]. I’ve seen the police. I’ve never seen AOC,” said Jenny Leo, 54, a pharmacist on Roosevelt Avenue.Leo said the situation isn’t worsening, but neither is it improving.David Ortega, manager at Bravo Supermarket, said, “People are stealing meat and beer and laundry detergent. The police come and they take them outside,” he said. “Two times recently the thieves tell me that they’re going to wait for me when I leave. They’re not afraid. It is not changing. It is the same.”He added, the AOC “doesn’t come here.”Concerns over gang activity are also escalating. Residents say migrant gangs have exploited the area, emboldened by a strained city infrastructure. In response, local leaders previously appealed to federal authorities, urging the FBI and Homeland Security to step in.Last month, federal officials announced charges against a migrant gang accused of running brothels, selling fake IDs and drugs, and assaulting rivals, all from a base of operations along Roosevelt Avenue. Prosecutors say the gang funnelled money to an illicit network in El Salvador.Former city councilman Hiram Monserrate, now an activist in East Elmhurst, believes more needs to be done, and quickly. “We want our Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to use her platform to bring in more police officers to stabilize the area. We want our community back,” he said.Monserrate credited the NYPD for the temporary drop in crime but warned that reduced enforcement has left the corridor exposed again. He also called for the return of the 100 state troopers that Governor Kathy Hochul deployed last autumn to support the NYPD.“We need them back,” he urged.Ocasio-Cortez’s team defended her record, saying the congresswoman is “focused on solutions not credit.”In a post on social media platform X, Ocasio-Cortez said, “Happy to be back in Corona Plaza to continue our team’s conversations with vendors and local business owners about our coordinated efforts to make Roosevelt Avenue a safer and cleaner place.”Spokeswoman Karla Santillan cited Ocasio-Cortez’s efforts to fix streetlights, clean up Corona Plaza, and improve sanitation, noting her participation in a community meeting last week.“The congresswoman is focused on solutions not credit. She has done multiple cleanups of the plaza on the other side, and on the official side has worked with DOT to fix street lights and improve sanitation,” said Santillan.","Queens residents, business owners, and civic leaders are accusing representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of ignoring worsening conditions along Roosevelt Avenue.

US-EU trade deal: US President Donald Trump on Sunday said that America and the European Union have ‘reached a deal’ on trade. Under the US-EU trade deal, America will impose a 15% tariff rate on products coming into the country from EU. ""We have reached a deal. It's a good deal for everybody,"" Trump said. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen also hailed a ‘good deal’ with America, according to an AFP report.During his media interaction in Scotland, Trump announced that the European Union had pledged additional investments of $600 billion in the US, alongside energy purchases amounting to $750 billion.""It was a very interesting negotiation. I think it's going to be great for both parties,"" Trump said.These crucial discussions aimed to prevent trade sanctions and potential European countermeasures that could have triggered worldwide economic instability.Following private discussions at Trump's Scottish golf facility, both Trump and EU chief Leyen announced they had achieved a comprehensive agreement.Earlier Trump had said that EU export tariffs would remain at a minimum of 15% during crucial trade discussions with the European Union's leader in Scotland.When questioned by a journalist about the possibility of reducing the tariff rate, Trump replied ""No"" whilst seated next to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. He additionally clarified that pharmaceutical products would be excluded from any trade agreement.Trump and Ursula von der Leyen met in Scotland for crucial discussions, seeking to resolve the prolonged transatlantic trade dispute, with negotiations reaching their final stages.Trump had maintained his stance that there was an equal probability of reaching an agreement with the European Union. The bloc had confronted a 30 percent US tariff unless a trade agreement was secured by August 1.Trump said on Sunday that ""the deals all start on August 1"", whilst Washington emphasised there would be ""no extensions"".The European Commission, under von der Leyen's leadership and representing EU member states, was working intensively to secure an agreement to preserve the trade relationship, which accounts for $1.9 trillion annually in goods and services.Speaking at the start of negotiations at Trump's upscale golf resort in Turnberry, the EU leader stated that if an agreement was reached, ""I think it would be the biggest deal each of us has ever"" made.The meeting between Trump and von der Leyen was held at the president's upscale golf resort situated in Turnberry along Scotland's southwestern shoreline.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has also welcomed the trade deal saying, ""We have thus managed to preserve our fundamental interests, even if I would have wished for more relief in transatlantic trade.""","US President Donald Trump says America and the European Union have'reached a deal' Under the US-EU trade deal, America will impose a 15% tariff rate on products coming into the country from EU.

Who is Trisha Chatterjee? Indian-origin immigration lawyer who said ICE gave her Taco Bell number during client crisis — watch video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-trisha-chatterjee-indian-origin-immigration-lawyer-who-said-ice-gave-her-taco-bell-number-during-client-crisis-watch-video/articleshow/122937093.cms,"Trisha Chatterjee (Picture source: LinkedIn)

Who is Trisha Chatterjee?

Trisha Chatterjee is an Indian-origin immigration lawyer based in Greater Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio. She graduated from Miami University in 2020 and the University of Dayton School of Law in 2023.

She works with the law office of Emily Feliz Garcia, a small immigration firm in Springdale. Before this, she worked at Abdallah law offices.

For the last two years, she has handled immigration cases, especially those involving clients detained at the Butler County Jail in Ohio, which has a contract with ICE.

Chatterjee was trying to submit ""stay of removal"" applications—urgent paperwork that can pause deportation for clients with pending immigration cases. ICE requires these to be submitted in person at the Detroit field office, but she hoped to file them locally in Blue Ash.

After being unable to reach anyone by phone or email, she finally spoke to an ICE officer who gave her a phone number that turned out to be for Taco Bell. When she called back, the officer reportedly said he was trying to make her laugh.

She posted a video about the incident on TikTok, which gained over 38,000 views. Many users sympathised, and one even helped her connect with a helpful ICE official in Blue Ash, who is now assisting her.

Chatterjee said the larger problem is the lack of access and communication with ICE. She also highlighted how a stricter bond policy is making it harder for immigrants to stay out of detention during legal proceedings. Bonds can cost up to $50,000 and must be paid upfront.

According to Chatterjee, some clients are abandoning their asylum cases or choosing to self-deport out of fear. She mentioned recent local arrests of people attending ICE check-ins, which has only deepened anxiety in immigrant communities.





Trisha Chatterjee, an Indian-origin immigration lawyer in Ohio, has alleged she was given the number of a Taco Bell outlet when she called ICE for urgent client support.Chatterjee posted about the incident on TikTok, where it went viral and ultimately led to help from another ICE official. But she says the larger issue lack of clear access to immigration authorities continues to cause serious harm to her clients.""I called and they answered and they said, 'Hello, Taco Bell?' And I said, 'Taco Bell?' And the guy who was working said, 'Yeah, Taco Bell. Ma'am, you called me,"" Chatterjee recalled.""I was in such disbelief,"" she said. ""So, I called the ICE officer back, just really frustrated with what had just happened. He says, 'Oh, I'm sorry. I was trying to lighten the mood and make you laugh.'""ICE has denied the accusation. Homeland security called it a “lie and a smear.” Chatterjee stood by her version of events.","Trisha Chatterjee, an Indian-origin immigration lawyer in Ohio, has alleged she was given the number of a Taco Bell outlet when she called ICE for urgent client support.

Long wait for asylum seekers to ger job permit in Canada, Ontario says they will bypass federal government







Canada will stop funding hotels for asylum seekers after September as the federal government already spent approximately $1,1 billion on temporary hotel housing since 2020. The Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada said it is funded to continue hotel operations only until September 30, 2025. The department said it will help those still in hotels find housing before September 30.Canada provided funding for asylum seekers since at least 2018 and it was only a stop-gap humanitarian measure as there was a sudden influx in the number of asylum seekers. It was never meant to be a permanent solution, CBC reported.Over 15,000 asylum claimants who were previously in hotels have now transitioned to independent living, CBC News reported. The department said it will help the 485 people remaining in the hotels find longer-term housing before the program ends on Sept. 30. It said it will support people on-site while they look for longer-term housing, and that it will continue ""supporting provinces and municipalities in developing their own long-term housing strategies. ""Canada provides hotel accommodations for some asylum seekers as part of its humanitarian support system to ensure they have basic shelter and safety while their refugee claims are being processed.Canada is a signatory to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention. Under both international and domestic law, it must provide protection, shelter, and basic services to people who claim asylum and are awaiting a decision.Ontario premier Doug Ford recently said asylum seekers have to wait for over two years to get work permit and it is not their fault that the government is paying their hotel stay as the immigration takes two years to process asylum claims. Ford said his administration can issue permits to the asylum seekers without waiting for the federal government's nod.In 2023, amid a funding deadlock between the federal government and the city, hundreds of asylum seekers were left to sleep on the streets of downtown Toronto.","Canada provided funding for asylum seekers since at least 2018 and it was only a stop-gap humanitarian measure as there was a sudden influx in the number of asylum seekers.

‘Like Krishna vs Kaliya’: 2-year-old boy in Bihar bites cobra to death after it coils around his hands,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/toddler-bites-cobra-to-death-lives-to-tell-tale/articleshow/122922613.cms,"Watch: UP man films a video of playing with venomous snake, suffers fatal bite

Poll Do you think this incident will change how the community views snakes? Yes, they will be more cautious. No, it won't change perceptions.





PATNA: In a hair-raising incident, a two-year-old boy in Bettiah, West Champaran, bit a cobra to death with his bare teeth after the serpent coiled itself tightly around his tiny hands.The extraordinary confrontation, reminiscent of the mythological tale of Lord Krishna and Kaliya Naag, left the toddler unconscious but alive, thanks to quick medical intervention.The boy, Govinda Kumar, son of one Sunil Sah, was playing near his home in Bankatwa village under Majhaulia block on Friday afternoon when the surreal sequence of events transpired. In Hindu mythology, Lord Krishna, also known as Govinda, subdued the venomous serpent Kaliya in the Yamuna river, a tale that symbolises triumph over evil. The eerie parallel between the divine legend and the child's real-life encounter has left villagers stunned.Govinda, ever curious, spotted the reptile and, perhaps unaware of its lethal nature, threw a piece of brick at it in play. Then, the snake struck back, coiling itself around the child's hands. But what happened next stunned the family and the entire village.Instead of screaming or running, the little boy sank his teeth into the snake's flesh, biting it so hard that it died on the spot.Recalling the jaw-dropping moment, Govinda's grandmother, Mateshwari Devi, said, ""When we saw the snake in the child's hand, everyone rushed towards him, but in the meantime, he already bit the snake, killing it on the spot.""The impact of the snakebite caused Govinda to faint immediately. He was rushed to the local primary health centre and later referred to Government Medical College Hospital (GMCH), Bettiah, where doctors described the case as ""highly unusual"".According to the medical team, it appears the cobra died from trauma to the head and mouth inflicted by the child's bite. Meanwhile, the venom's effect on Govinda was relatively mild, enough to knock him unconscious, but not enough to be fatal.""Timely treatment saved Govinda's life,"" doctors at GMCH said. ""The child's condition is currently stable and treatment is being administered under the supervision of doctors. The medical team is treating the child, providing continuous medication and he is under observation,"" said GMCH doctor Saurabh Kumar.","Two-year-old boy bit a cobra to death with his bare teeth after the serpent coiled itself tightly around his tiny hands.

DEHRADUN: Amidst the ongoing probe into an alleged religious conversion case registered around 10 days ago in Dehradun, police on Saturday filed a second case involving six persons, including a woman, for allegedly converting a 28-year-old woman and attempting to send her to the UAE with ""forged documents to marry a Muslim man"". According to Dehradun SSP Ajai Singh, police have also found links to Egypt-based radical organisation, Muslim Brotherhood, which is banned in many countries.""The second case was registered under sections 3 and 5 of the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, in the city's Premnagar police station on a complaint lodged by the brother of the woman, a resident of Bareilly, who came to Dehradun for studies. The accused were identified as Abdul Rehman alias ‘Mahendra Pal Singh'; his two sons Abdul Rahim and Abdullah, all residents of Delhi; Abdur Rehman alias ‘Rupendra Singh' from Dehradun; Aisha alias ‘Krishna Sahu' from Goa; and Suleiman, currently staying in Dubai and originally from Dehradun. Five of them were already arrested by UP police,"" the SSP said.He added: ""During the first case in Ranipokhari around 10 days ago, a 21-year-old woman, ‘Mariam', who was being influenced by perpetrators of this organised gang, was counselled by police. She told the cops about another woman named Sumaiyya (name after conversion). She was contacted and counselled too, during which she narrated the whole episode on how she came in contact with the gang members who have links to suspected aides in Pakistan, UAE and Egypt via a WhatsApp group.Sumaiyya, 28, told police during her counselling that she first came to know about the conversion process through a Muslim friend ""who made her recite religious verses over a video call one day and named her ‘Sumaiyya'"".The friend also invited her to her home in Kashmir about a year ago during Ramzan, claimed Sumaiyya. She met a few Kashmiri men there who made her join the aforementioned group. Sumaiyya was thereafter introduced to a Pakistani-developed app termed ‘Ludo Star', and came in contact with some people from the neighbouring country including a cleric Tanveer Ahmed.Sumaiyya claimed that ""Ahmed offered to teach her the Quran and Arabic language through online classes"". Through the app, she also became friends with another Dubai-based Pakistani, Tehseen, through whom she said she paid fee to Ahmed for the classes. As per his suggestion, she deposited the money in the bank account of Dubai-based Dehradun resident Suleiman who then transferred it to Ahmed's account in Pakistan.The SSP further shared that one of the accused, Abdul Rehman, who came in contact with her on the Whatsapp group, insisted she come to Delhi to undergo the official procedure of changing her faith due to the existing UCC and the anti-conversion law in place in the hill state.She went to Delhi thrice during which Abdul, through his two sons, got forged IDs including Aadhaar with her converted name Sumaiyya and his Delhi address imprinted on it. It was also found that the accused lured her by offering to get her paintings sold in the UAE. The three had allegedly planned to send her to the UAE after availing a passport with her new forged ID, but she was traced down by police.A probe is on to bring the five arrested accused to Uttarakhand as per legal procedure, said Singh.","The second case was registered under sections 3 and 5 of the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, in the city's Premnagar police station.

Poll Do you believe that prison security measures are adequate to prevent jailbreaks? Yes No





KANNUR: Govindachamy alias Charley Thomas, convicted of rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman in 2011, escaped from the high-security block of the Kannur Central Prison early on Friday. The 41-year-old life convict, whose left hand is amputated, was apprehended by police within hours. He was found hiding inside a well on the premises of National Sample Survey Office at Thalap, police said.Kannur city police commissioner P Nithin Raj said the jailbreak occurred between 4.15 and 6.30am. Jail authorities discovered his absence during a morning inspection, after assistant prison officer trainees, who were out training, found clothes hanging from the prison wall along the national highway.Govindachamy had cut through the iron bars of his cell using a bar cutter and fashioned a rope out of cloth and bedsheets, police said.Jail officials are clueless on how he managed to scale the prison wall without assistance. The six-metre wall of the prison is topped with an electric fence, which is believed to have been non-functional at the time. Three prison officers on duty at the time have been suspended following a preliminary inquiry that found lapses on their part.Police launched a statewide manhunt soon after, and apprehended Govindachamy following a tip-off from a local resident, Vinoj, who spotted him in Thalap in the morning. ""I was riding my two-wheeler when I noticed a man walking slowly on the left side of the road. He looked like a beggar, and we exchanged glances briefly. I had already heard about Govindachamy's escape from prison, and something about the man I saw made me suspicious. .. When I called out his name, he immediately bolted into a narrow lane and jumped over the compound wall of an under-construction building,"" Vinoj said.Police later confirmed his identity after reviewing CCTV footage from the area. Based on this, a large contingent of officers, along with residents, intensified the search. A dog squad was also deployed. M Unnikrishnan, a NSSO staffer, spotted the convict in the well while inspecting the premises. Police, assisted by residents, apprehended Govindachamy.He was then taken to the Kannur town station and, after a medical examination, brought to the central prison for evidence collection. He was produced before the Kannur judicial first class magistrate court and remanded in custody for 14 days. He is likely to be shifted to the Viyyur high-security prison in Thrissur.Govindachamy is a native of Virudhachalam in Tamil Nadu. The 2011 case had shocked the nation and sparked a debate over women's safety on public transport. The victim, who was travelling alone on a passenger train from Ernakulam to Shoranur, was pushed out of the moving train and raped on the railway track. She later succumbed to her injuries at a hospital.","Jail officials are clueless on how he managed to scale the prison wall without assistance.

PUNE: In a seven-hour operation on Saturday, forest staffers and locals rescued 300 trekkers, including 100 women, after they were left stranded in the forest at Malshej Ghat where the level of the Kalu river increased because of rainfall measuring 200mm in three hours.The incident happened at Waghachi Wadi on the Thane-Pune border, about 150km from Pune city, near the Kalyan-Ahilyanagar highway. The rescue effort commenced at 3pm and continued until 10pm, successfully bringing to safety the trekkers - mostly from Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune.Officials from Thane and Junnar forest divisions, who were part of the rescue effort, said most trekkers had arrived early in the morning and had not anticipated the heavy showers or rise in the river water.The state disaster management cell and the district administrations informed the rescuers about the incident after receiving calls for help. The operation was particularly difficult, as locals had to swim through the gushing water to secure ropes and harnesses to trees and use a zipline to transport individuals across the river.Local resident of Morushi village Bhaskar Mengal (24), who was amongst the first to respond to the crisis, said, ""There was no way to reach the trekkers other than to swim through the gushing and rising water.I swam across the river to tie ropes and harness to the trees. The tourists were scared and I had to calm them down. We first rescued the women after explaining how to use a zipline to cross the river and allaying fears about a fall. We sent them across one by one. Later, another villager, Kamlu Pokla, and forest guards joined me.""Range forest officer of Tokavade forest range in Thane district Rajvardhan Bhosale told TOI that the tourists ventured into the restricted dense forest on Saturday morning without consulting the villagers. They were unaware of the local conditions, which led to the situation where the river's water level suddenly rose within a few hours. The area is treacherous and risky for outsiders,"" he added.Meanwhile, Pokla said, ""The stranded trekkers panicked and were hesitant to follow our instructions as it started to turn dark. We had to calm them down before rescuing them from the deep forest.""Forest officials said tourists prefer to approach the Kalu river waterfall from the Murbad tehsil side because the trek to the waterfall is steep. However, the zone is located within a reserved forest area, home to a large population of wildlife, including leopards and venomous snakes.Junnar division's assistant forest officer Smita Rajhans said, ""Visitors from Maharashtra and other states flock to Junnar and surrounding areas for monsoon treks after watching videos on social media. They often disregard their safety and forget to hire locals for guidance. They attempt adventurous activities in dense forest zones leading to difficult situations.""Kalu Waterfall is situated in Khireshwar village, Junnar tehsil - which is part of the Malshej Ghat region. It is renowned for its stunning natural beauty and attracts thousands of visitors, especially from Mumbai and Pune, during monsoon. The river cascades from a height of 1,200ft, making it one of the largest waterfalls in the region and district.However, locals have been voicing concerns about protocol at the site, noting that inadequate safety measures have resulted in numerous fatalities.

SEOUL: North Korea has no interest in pursuing dialogue with the south, leader Kim Jong Un 's powerful sister said Monday, dismissing a new president in Seoul who has vowed to mend ties.Since his election in June, south Korean president Lee Jae Myung has broken with his predecessor's hawkish tone on the north and halted loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts along the border, begun in response to a barrage of trash-filled north Korean balloons.North Korea has ended its own propaganda broadcasts, which had boomed strange and eerie noises into the south.But such gestures do not mean Seoul should expect a thawing of icy ties, Kim Yo Jong said in an English dispatch carried by the north's official Korean Central News Agency on Monday.""If the ROK... expected that it could reverse all the results it had made with a few sentimental words, nothing is more serious miscalculation than it,"" she said, referring to south Korea by its official name.""We clarify once again the official stand that no matter what policy is adopted and whatever proposal is made in Seoul, we have no interest in it and there is neither the reason to meet nor the issue to be discussed with the ROK,"" she added.""The DPRK-ROK relations have irreversibly gone beyond the time zone of the concept of homogeneous,"" she said, using the north's official acronym.Seoul said Kim's statement, Pyongyang's first reaction to Lee's overture, ""reaffirms the high level of mistrust between the two due to years of hostile policies"".""We take this as a sign that the north is closely monitoring the Lee administration's North Korea policy,"" Unification Ministry Spokesman Koo Byung-sam said at a press briefing.Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told AFP that Kim's statement underscored Pyongyang's entrenched anti-south stance.""It declares that its hostile perception towards the south has become irreversible,"" he said.The two countries technically remain atL war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.The United States, a key security ally of south Korea, keeps around 28,000 troops in the south to help it defend attacks from the nuclear-armed north.The south's Lee has said he would seek talks with the north without preconditions, following a deep freeze under his predecessor when relations plummeted to their worst level in years.","North Korea has no interest in pursuing dialogue with the south, leader Kim Jong Un's sister says.

NEW DELHI: Two separate rape cases have been reported from Odisha’s Malkangiri district, with police confirming the arrest of two persons. In one of the cases, the survivor delivered a stillborn baby, according to PTI.According to Additional SP Rashmiranjan Senapati, the first incident occurred on July 20 in a village under Orkel police station.A 50-year-old man allegedly offered a girl a lift while she was on her way to her uncle’s house and instead took her to a forested area where he raped her.The survivor informed her family the following day. After villagers failed to act, her uncle filed a police complaint on Saturday.“As the villagers could not take any action, I took the matter to the police,” he said in the complaint.The accused was arrested the next day, police confirmed.The second incident was reported from the Mudulipada police station area.According to police, the survivor had allegedly been raped since 2024. The case surfaced after she gave birth to a stillborn baby at a government hospital. Following a complaint by her family, the accused was arrested.Earlier on July 20, another shocking case emerged from the district where a girl was gang-raped twice within hours first by three men and later by a truck driver who found her in distress.All four accused were arrested.The recent wave of crimes against women in Odisha has raised questions over law and order under the BJP-led government, which completed one year in office.The BJP, however, has claimed that swift action has been taken whenever such incidents have come to light.","Two separate rape cases have been reported from Odisha’s Malkangiri district.

Former US President Barack Obama on Monday urged immediate action to prevent what he called the ""preventable"" starvation unfolding in Gaza, referring to the situation caused by the war that erupted between Israel and Hamas on October 7, 2023.""While a lasting resolution to the crisis in Gaza must involve a return of all hostages and a cessation of Israel’s military operations, these articles underscore the immediate need for action to be taken to prevent the travesty of innocent people dying of preventable starvation,"" Obama posted on X, alongside links to two New York Times articles.""Aid must be permitted to reach people in Gaza.

In a disturbing video footage from downtown Cincinnati, a man and a woman can be seen violently attacked during a chaotic brawl on Friday night, beaten mercilessly and pushed to the ground.The clip, which has since gone viral, shows the pair being swarmed by a crowd, with the white man appearing to be chased into the street, shoved to the ground and savagely kicked, punched and stomped on by several individuals. One attacker even body-slams him as others from the crowd, both men and women, continue to cheer and join in.The man, struggling to stand, is seen getting to his feet when a woman runs over to help him.However, just as she tries to pull one of the attackers away, she too, is punched twice in the face. The woman then falls back, hitting her head on the pavement and lying motionless as blood drips from her mouth. The crowd continues to jeer before the video ends.It remains unclear what sparked the violence. Witnesses told local station WXIX that racial slurs were exchanged before it began, although it is not clear who initiated the aggression.Some said the man had spoken to members of the group about 15 minutes earlier, before returning to the area, as reported by the New York Post.Cincinnati Police are actively investigating and attempting to identify everyone involved.“I am in complete disgust waking up to the viral video many of you have now seen,” said Cincinnati police chief Theresa Theetge in a statement on Saturday.“The behavior displayed is nothing short of cruel and absolutely unacceptable.”Ken Kober, President of the Cincinnati Fraternal Order of Police, strongly criticised not only the attackers but also the bystanders who failed to intervene.“The violence this video shows downtown is disgusting,” he told WLWT5. “What’s equally disgusting is those who chose to watch and record instead of calling 911, attempting to defuse the situation or render aid.”“I have full faith in the Central Business Section Investigators they will make arrests in the near future. It will then be the responsibility of the court system to hold these violent thugs accountable,” he added.The condition and identities of the victims have not yet been confirmed, but the police are trying to identify everyone in the video.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT.

O ne of the ten Americans released from Venezuela last week in a prisoner swap was a convicted killer serving a 30-year sentence, Spanish and Venezuelan officials have confirmed.Dahud Hanid Ortiz was jailed in Venezuela for the 2016 murder of three people inside a Madrid law office. As per Spanish interior minister, the 54-year-old Ortiz, had entered the firm looking for a specific lawyer, who headed the office.However, the official was not there at the time. Ortiz then fatally stabbed two female staff members and a client.Although he was arrested in Venezuela two years later, Ortiz was never extradited to Spain. He was sentenced on January 9, 2024, in Venezuela.Despite being informed of Ortiz’s conviction, US officials went ahead with his inclusion in the swap, according to Venezuela’s justice minister Diosdado Cabello. A US official familiar with the matter confirmed that Washington knew of Ortiz’s past, but still opted to secure his release.The prisoner exchange saw 10 Americans freed in return for over 200 Venezuelan migrants, who had been deported from the US and transferred to a high-security prison in El Salvador.Eight of the Americans were officially classed by Washington as “wrongfully detained.” Ortiz was not classified in the category, ABC news reported.Officials said the primary objective was to get US citizens out of Venezuela’s notoriously harsh prison system, even if that meant freeing a man once convicted of a triple killing.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)","Dahud Hanid Ortiz was jailed in Venezuela for the 2016 murder of three people inside a Madrid law office.

Trump is shown lying in bed with Satan arguing wth Canadian PM







The White House's first reaction to Wednesday night's South Park premiere attacking President Donald Trump is here. Trump's White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told Rolling Stone: ""The Left's hypocrisy truly has no end — for years they have come after South Park for what they labeled as 'offense' [sic] content, but suddenly they are praising the show.""Just like the creators of South Park, the Left has no authentic or original content, which is why their popularity continues to hit record lows. This show hasn't been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention. President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country's history — and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump's hot streak. ""After a gap of almost two and a half years, South Park kicked off its 27th season after creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone reached a $1.5 billion streaming deal with Paramount. Paramount is the parent company of Comedy Central, where South Park airs, and CBS—which has received widespread criticism over its decision to cancel The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.During the premiere episode, titled ""Sermon on the 'Mount,"" Trump is shown lying in bed with Satan, arguing with the Canadian prime minister and complaining about the size of his penis.Trump insinuates that he wants to have sex with Satan, but the devil turns him down.

Alina Habba is appointed as New Jersey’s acting US attorney, a day before her tenure as interim US attorney was set to expire on Friday.Habba made the announcement via social media that she would remain at the helm. The announcement follows the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw her nomination for the permanent role, a legal technicality that now allows her to serve as acting US attorney for up to 210 more days.A spokesperson for the Justice Department confirmed the move, while the White House reiterated President Trump’s full backing for Habba. ""President Trump continues to have full confidence in Alina Habba and her commitment to serve the people of New Jersey,"" said White House spokesperson Harrison Fields.The decision ends a tense standoff between Washington officials and federal judges in New Jersey, which had raised confusion within the office about who was legally in charge. Earlier this week, the judges had selected their own candidate, experienced federal prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace. But shortly after, the justice department fired Grace, accusing the judges of acting politically and reaffirming support for Habba.Grace, widely respected within the justice department, had posted her willingness to serve, calling it the “greatest honor” to be chosen on merit. However, Habba’s statement the next day left little doubt about who would lead the office.“I don’t cower to pressure. I don’t answer to politics. This is a fight for justice. And I’m all in,” Habba wrote on Thursday.She followed up with a message to staff, “There has been enough noise the past four months.”“Let’s keep our focus and get back to the important work ahead for the District of New Jersey,” the New York Times cited Habba.Habba, a former personal lawyer to Donald Trump , has no prior prosecutorial experience. Since taking the role in March, she has drawn national attention for launching investigations into prominent Democrats and declaring her ambition to help ""turn New Jersey red,"" a stance that has raised eyebrows given the traditionally nonpartisan nature of the post.In a further twist, a Justice Department spokesperson confirmed that Habba resigned briefly on Thursday from the interim role and was reclassified as first assistant, a position that previously belonged to Grace, whom Habba herself had appointed as deputy earlier this year.Grace, a Republican and the first in her family to attend university, made her name as a federal prosecutor tackling gang violence. Her work, including high-profile MS-13 convictions, earned her recognition within the Justice Department. Legal peers, such as Robert Scrivo, praised her dedication and effectiveness. “I don't know that anyone did it at a higher level,” Scrivo said, as quoted by New York Times.Despite recent events, Habba had publicly acknowledged Grace’s contributions, telling colleagues in May that appointing her deputy had been the best decision of her tenure, a comment met with applause.",Alina Habba is appointed as New Jersey's acting US attorney.

'Murderers, Rapists Welcomed': Trump Ally Ted Cruz Torches Dems, Biden Over 'Criminal Aliens'





Former President Joe Biden has secured a deal with Little, Brown & Co. to pen a memoir about his White House tenure. Industry executives revealed that the untitled book, acquired through an auction by the Hachette imprint, garnered a £10 million advance, as initially reported by The Wall Street Journal.President Biden hinted that his memoir will cover his four years as President, according to NY Post.Diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer in May, the 82-year-old Biden has discussed the project at various public gatherings, expressing urgency to complete it amidst his health challenges. At a San Diego event, he stated that he was ""working like hell with a publisher"" to research and expedite a memoir focusing on his presidential period.While former presidents traditionally publish accounts of their time in office, Biden's memoir offers an opportunity to address concerns about his physical and mental capabilities, alongside presenting his presidential narrative.At an event earlier this month, Biden said that he was “working my tail off” to write a memoir. He was represented by Creative Artists Agency, which sold the worldwide rights for the book to Hachette.The agency also represented Biden for his 2017 memoir “Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship and Purpose,” which chronicled his final year with his eldest son, Beau, who died from brain cancer in 2015.Having achieved his long-held presidential ambition, Biden became the oldest incumbent upon his January 2020 inauguration. He later withdrew from the 2024 electoral race amid growing concerns about his capacity to serve.Subsequently, discussions have centred on whether his close associates and party overlooked his apparent decline.Also read: Hillary Clinton flagged concerns on Biden's 'viability' before re-election bid; ex-NSA Jake Sullivan also approached Ron Klain Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's ""Original Sin"", a significant non-fiction release this year, examines how Biden's protective inner circle disregarded his fragility, potentially compromising Democratic electoral prospects. The book achieved considerable success, with nearly 100,000 print copies sold according to Circana BookScan. Conservative publishers have responded with publications focusing on controversies surrounding his son Hunter.Presidential memoirs typically command eight-figure advances, valued for prestige as much as sales potential. Biden's memoir, however, is considerably valued lower than his peers. Barack and Michelle Obama notably secured approximately £60 million from Penguin Random House in 2017.Both Obama books achieved remarkable success: ""A Promised Land"" exceeded 2.8 million hardcover sales, while ""Becoming"" surpassed 5 million print copies, per Circana BookScan. Bill Clinton's 2004 ""My Life"" and George W. Bush's ""Decision Points"" also achieved significant commercial success with substantial advances.However, the political non-fiction market has evolved, becoming increasingly divided. Recent publications analysing the 2024 election have struggled to attract broad readership.Biden's 2017 publication ""Promise Me, Dad"", chronicling his son Beau's death from brain cancer, balanced political content with personal loss and achieved bestseller status. Other Biden family members, including his sister Valerie Biden Owens and son Hunter, have published memoirs. Jill Biden authored a 2019 memoir about their family life and several children's books.","Former President Joe Biden has secured a deal with Little, Brown & Co. to pen a memoir about his White House tenure.

US singer Sean Feucht’s permit to hold a concert at the York Redoubt National Historic Site in Halifax was cancelled this week by Parks Canada.

Some people even cursed ill health upon us,"" Christine Barr said.In response to criticism, Feucht posted,""Here's the hard truth, If I had shown up with purple hair and a dress, claiming to be a woman, the government wouldn't have said a thing.

A stabbing attack at a Walmart store in Traverse City, Michigan, left 11 people injured on Sunday. But what could have been far worse was stopped by a two bystanders, and one man in particular is being praised across social media, Derrick Perry.Video from the scene, later verified by CNN, shows the suspect being cornered in the parking lot by a group of civilians. One man stands out, pointing a gun directly at the suspect, keeping him frozen in place until police arrived. That man is Perry.While authorities haven’t officially named him, Perry’s family and locals have identified him in Facebook posts, calling him a true hero. One post read, “This is Derrick Perry! He is the man who took his gun out and risked his life to save many lives.” A woman added in the comments, “So proud to be his daughter-in-law.

He was reportedly trying to flee when two former Marines, Matt Kolakowski and Perry — intervened.Kolakowski told CNN that he had no weapon but charged at the attacker with a shopping cart, hitting him hard enough to knock him down. Perry, a veteran himself, then drew his licensed weapon and held the man at gunpoint until others tackled him and officers arrived.Eleven victims were taken to Munson Medical Center.

During Donald Trump 's visit to his Turnberry golf course in South Ayrshire, Scotland, on Saturday, an armoured golf cart nicknamed ""Golf force one"" was deployed for his security. The reinforced buggy followed him throughout the game.The buggy, believed to be a reinforced Polaris Ranger XP, appeared heavily armoured,and could serve as a quick getaway vehicle in case of an attack. The black vehicle has drawn comparisons to “The Beast”, the bulletproof car used to transport US presidents.“From those photos, that is 100 per cent armored.

Pakistan tribal council threatens highway block over girl’s murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tribal-council-threatens-highway-block-over-girls-murder/articleshow/122939897.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: A tribal jirga (council of elders) in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway on July 29 after the killing of a nine-year-old girl sparked public outrage. Convened in Tank’s Gul Imam on Saturday, the jirga issued an 11-point charter of demands, warning of a full blockade if authorities fail to respond.Indus Highway (N-55) is a critical national artery that runs along the river, connecting Karachi in Pakistan’s south with Peshawar in the north and cutting through multiple provinces. The planned blockade at Pezu will impact trade routes, passenger transport, and military convoys.The protests gained momentum after a viral video showed residents confronting armed security personnel -- an extraordinary act in this militarised stretch of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The footage amplified long-standing anger over arbitrary detentions, raids without warrants, and what locals call collective punishment disguised as counterterrorism.“Our decision to block the highway remains. If our demands are accepted, we’ll reconsider.If not, Pezu will be shut down on July 29,” jirga leader Abdul Qayum Kundi said.Police have registered a case in the girl’s death, but authorities have yet to disclose any findings. Locals allege misconduct or negligence by security forces—claims that remain unverified but widely believed within the community.In a bid to defuse tensions, local officials delivered three sheep and (Pak) Rs 2.5 million (around $9,000) to the girl’s family -- an act rooted in tribal custom, meant to symbolise remorse and reconciliation. But jirga members view it as a token gesture. “This is hush money in ceremonial form,” said one elder.The jirga’s demands include the release of detainees not proven to have militant ties, an end to forced house searches, and a halt to arrests of suspects’ relatives. They also call for the return of confiscated weapons and an end to detentions based on vague accusations of mukhbiri (spying).The jirga’s demands echo those of the banned Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), which for years challenged Pakistan’s security policies in its tribal belt.","A tribal jirga in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway.

‘Reject Pakistani Rule’: BNM Accuses Pakistan of Genocide in Balochistan, Launches Armed Resistance

Poll Do you think that protests and appeals by families of the abducted individuals can lead to change? Yes, they can raise awareness. No, they are largely ineffective.





The crisis of enforced disappearances in Pakistan's Balochistan region and beyond has deepened this week, as a disturbing string of abductions emerges from Karachi, Noshki, and Kech, according to The Balochistan Post (TBP).Among the most alarming cases is that of Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi.On Monday evening, he was reportedly abducted near the university's Maskan Gate. Eyewitnesses say he was taken by unidentified men in a vehicle while returning to his hostel with friends.Originally from Mashkay in Awaran district, Muslim Dad was a familiar face within the Baloch student community in Karachi. His sudden disappearance has sparked fear among his peers and left his family devastated.In Noshki, another troubling case unfolded earlier today when Hafeezullah, the son of Peer Mohammad and a resident of Qaziabad, was allegedly picked up from his home by Pakistani security forces. His family has raised alarm over his unknown whereabouts and is demanding his immediate release.TBP also reported two recent disappearances in Kech district.On July 23, 16-year-old shopkeeper Qambar Baloch was allegedly taken by men believed to belong to Military Intelligence and the ISI while he was in Jusak, Turbat. And on June 27, Imran Khan, a 26-year-old student of Balochi language and culture at the University of Turbat, was reportedly abducted by Frontier Corps and Military Intelligence personnel in Turbat city—in broad daylight.“These are not isolated cases. This is a pattern,” said a representative from Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), a group that has long campaigned for the safe recovery of abducted individuals. Despite repeated appeals and protests, most cases remain unresolved, with no accountability or formal investigations.","Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi, was reportedly abducted on Monday.

Pakistan Blames India For Tensions, Credits Trump For Ceasefire Between Nuclear Rivals





Beijing/Islamabad: Pakistan army chief Asim Munir, who is on his first visit to China after his elevation as the field marshal, on Friday held talks with top Chinese leaders and discussed ways to deepen cooperation across all sectors. Munir held separate meetings with V-P Han Zheng, top military official general Zhang Youxia and foreign minister Wang Yi, according to official media reports.This is Munir's first visit to China after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistam in response to the Pahalgam terror attack. During the conflict, Pakistan used extensive military equipment supplied by China. This is also Munir's first visit to China after his trip to Washington, where he met US President Trump and sought to establish close ties with America, Beijing's strategic rival.The visit coincides with Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar making a trip to Washington, where he is expected to meet US secretary of state Marco Rubio. Dar was in China July 14 to attend Shanghai Cooperation Organisation foreign ministers' meeting.A Pakistan military statement said that in their talks, the ""Chinese leadership lauded Pakistan armed forces as a cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor to peace in South Asia.

ISLAMABAD: As jailed former PM Imran Khan completes two years in prison, his sons – Sulaiman and Qasim – have stepped into the political spotlight, launching an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release just days before Khan’s call for a nationwide protest on Aug 5, which has put the state on edge.Khan, arrested on Aug 5, 2023, remains behind bars despite some convictions being overturned. He is currently serving time in three major cases that his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), claims are part of a broader effort to keep him out of politics.He was convicted in the Toshakhana case, involving the illegal sale of state gifts received during his premiership. He was sentenced in the cipher case, accused of leaking classified diplomatic correspondence for political gain. And in the Al-Qadir Trust case, Khan and his wife were held liable for controversial land deals linked to a charitable trust.PTI has consistently maintained that the charges are politically motivated, aimed at “eliminating the most popular leader” in the country.Now, with most of PTI’s senior leadership jailed, exiled, or forced to resign, Khan’s sons have taken the international route. Based in the UK, the brothers have held meetings in Washington DC with US lawmakers, policy groups and human rights organisations, and are reportedly preparing to testify before congressional panels.Their message: Imran Khan is being held in solitary confinement in inhumane conditions, denied light, medical access, and family contact.The campaign has triggered speculation about whether the two sons might return to Pakistan, possibly to appear at the planned protest. While PTI has not confirmed this, party insiders say their presence could act as a powerful morale boost for the party’s dispersed support base.Meanwhile, the state has moved swiftly to neutralise any protest momentum. On July 22, an anti-terror court in Lahore sentenced eight senior PTI leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, to 10 years in prison for their alleged role in the May 9 riots, when military installations were targeted after Khan’s initial arrest. Observers see the convictions as a tactical strike to undercut mobilisation ahead of the Aug 5 protest. The verdicts have raised concerns among legal experts about the selective use of terrorism laws against political opponents.From prison, Khan has issued a call for unity among PTI ranks, urging supporters to “shun differences” and prepare for what he called a decisive moment for Pakistan’s democracy. But the party remains fractured and leaderless, with ongoing rifts between loyalists and factions seen as open to negotiations with the establishment.At the heart of the political storm is the army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was controversially elevated to five-star rank in May. PTI blames him, along with PML-N and PPP leaders, for orchestrating what it calls a civil-military clampdown to sideline Khan and crush dissent.In a recent prison note, Khan mocked Munir as the “King of the Jungle”, accusing him of ruling the country through “fear, not law”.","Sulaiman and Qasim Khan have launched an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release.

'98% entry guaranteed!'



'Broken system, easy to manipulate'







A visa fraud network is being run by some Pakistani consultants who are exploiting loopholes in the UK immigration system, with one firm claiming a “98% success” rate for entry, according to a report by The Telegraph.The investigation found that forged documents, including fake CVs, employment letters, and bank statements, were being sold for up to £50,000 to secure work and student visas. These materials, riddled with basic errors, were being waved through by the UK home office, enabling illegal but technically “legal” entry into Britain.The report revealed that a widespread visa fraud operation targeting Britain’s immigration system, orchestrated by Pakistani consultants, with one guarantying entry into the UK with ""98% success"".""Syed Kamran Haider, the chief executive of Mirpur Visa Consultant (MVC) in the Pakistan-administered region of Kashmir, was found to be operating openly online, where he advertises loopholes in the UK asylum system, which experts described as 'easy to manipulate',"" the report said.MVC was charging thousands of pounds to fabricate documents such as fake CVs and bank statements for visa applicants. These falsified materials were used to meet UK immigration criteria.One such forged application, including a bogus employment letter from a non-existent hospital riddled with grammatical errors, was successfully used to secure a UK work visa, it said.UK-based immigration lawyer Harjap Bhangal blamed the nation's ""broken system"" which was ""easy to manipulate"".“If you claim asylum before that visa runs out, you can still work. The Home Office is a broken institution... They are not realising where the loopholes are [and] what is being done, what migrants are doing,” The Telegraph quoted him as saying.“These visa ‘consultants’ are “selling them a dream,” he said, adding: “[They are] selling a product essentially to people who don’t want to come back [home]. They have found their market. [It’s] quite a sophisticated scam.”Last year, Pakistanis filed 10,542 asylum applications in the UK, the highest from any single nationality and an 80% surge from the previous year, the report said citing government data. Despite these soaring numbers, Pakistanis rarely featured among the top 10 nationalities crossing into Britain via small boats, suggesting they were entering through legal visa channels, and staying there.","Visa fraud network being run by some Pakistani consultants exploiting loopholes in the UK immigration system. forged documents, including fake CVs, employment letters, and bank statements, were being sold for up to £50,000 to secure work and student visas.
