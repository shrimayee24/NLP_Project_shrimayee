NEW DELHI: In a setback to West Bengal government, Supreme Court on Tuesday said it was ""very disturbed"" by the status report of the CBI probe finding serious faults with the way Kolkata Police collected evidence and secured the crime scene in RG Kar Hospital where a doctor was raped and murdered on Aug 9.A bench led by CJI D Y Chandrachud made this observation after the counsel for the original petitioner before Calcutta HC accused state police of employing a bizarre process for search and seizure, and alleged that the crime scene was deliberately left unguarded to let vandals destroy vital evidence.""What you are flagging is of the utmost concern. CBI itself is very concerned that this has happened,"" CJI told the counsel.""CBI is investigating... whether there was tampering with the scene of crime, whether evidence was destroyed and whether any other person (apart from those arrested) was involved,"" SC said.It will be unwise for us to reveal anything at this stage, which may enable suspects to destroy evidence. Making a disclosure today of what the CBI is doing will jeopardise the course of investigation. We cannot also disclose the lines of further investigation of CBI,"" the SC bench, also comprising Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, said.The bench assured the parents of the victim and the resident doctors, who have been agitating for justice since the crime, that the line of investigation indicated that justice would be done, and the perpetrators of the crime would be brought to book.""We can assure you that the line of further investigation which is being carried out by CBI is intended to unearth the absolute truth and further truth and any further leads that may emerge apart from the accused who have been arrested. We will keep it at that so as not to jeopardise the investigations,"" the bench said, its comment appearing significant in view of Trinamool's frequent sniping at the premier investigating agency.Appearing for senior doctors of RG Kar and other hospitals in Kolkata, senior advocate Karuna Nundy said senior doctors had evidence in their possession that clearly established a link between the heinous crime and financial irregularities . The bench asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to instruct CBI to file probe status report before the SC on the next date.""Apart from the principal, the SHO has been arrested. He is in the custody of CBI and very significant pieces of evidence may be revealed during the investigation. CBI has responded specifically to the queries which all of us raised during the last hearing, including whether the 'challan' and statutory form were submitted for post-mortem, what document was submitted by Kolkata Police for the purpose of post-mortem,"" the bench said.",CBI probe finds serious faults with the way Kolkata Police collected evidence and secured the crime scene in RG Kar Hospital where a doctor was raped and murdered on Aug 9.

'Hindu Jinnah, chaukidaar chor hai ... ': Nadda lists abuses hurled at PM Modi by Congress leaders



'Meaningless,' retorts Congress



'Why is Congress proud of Rahul Gandhi?'



NEW DELHI: BJP chief JP Nadda on Thursday hit back at Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge 's letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi , calling it an effort to ""polish and re-launch"" their ""failed product."" Nadda also accused the grand old party of hurling abuses at PM Modi over 110 times in the past decade after Kharge asked the PM to school his party leaders regarding the use of ""violent languages"" against Rahul Gandhi.""Respected Kharge ji, after reading the letter that you have written to the illustrious Prime Minister of the country, Shri Narendra Modi ji, in an effort to once again polish and launch your failed product which was repeatedly rejected by the public due to political compulsion, and launch it in the market, I felt that what you said was far away from reality and truth,"" Nadda said in the letter.Nadda also accused Sonia Gandhi of making ""shameful statements"" on PM Modi saying, ""It was Rahul Gandhi's mother Sonia Gandhi, not Kharge ji, who made such a strong statement for Modi ji like 'maut ka saudagar' (dealer of death). Did you use rude words? All these unfortunate and shameful statements are the responsibility of you and your party.Listing over a series of abuses, Nadda alleged, ""In the last 10 years, the leaders of Congress and Company have abused the country's illustrious Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji more than 110 times and the unfortunate thing is that the top leadership of Congress is also involved in this.""""Sometimes it was said 'Modi will dig your grave', sometimes it was said 'neech', sometimes 'bastard', sometimes 'merchant of death', sometimes 'poisonous snake', sometimes 'scorpion', sometimes 'rat', sometimes 'Ravan', Sometimes 'Bhasmasur,"" he said as he went on to mention a series of inappropriate words.He said that the Congress' letter exposed the ""double standards"" of the party adding that ""On one hand you are calling for political correctness but on the other hand your party and your leaders have a history of flouting political correctness. Why such a double attitude?""Congress retorted to the ""meaningless"" response, recalling the time when former PM Manmohan Singh used to reply to ""all official and personal letters sent to him for seventeen years - as over 100 volumes of his selected works attest.""Taking to X, Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh said, ""When former PM Dr Manmohan Singh writes to the non-biological PM on Covid-19, the health minister is handed a humiliating reply to send in his name.""""Now when the president of Congress and Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge ji wrote a letter to the non-biological Prime Minister regarding the serious threats being given to the Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi by Modi ji's associates, the BJP President was given the task of sending a meaningless reply,"" he added.Nadda further levelled serious allegations against the leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi saying that attends programs supporting terrorists. The BJP president, however, provided no proof of these allegations.""Kharge ji, why is the Congress party proud of Rahul Gandhi? Because he makes mistakes with pro-Pakistan and anti-India people or because they go and stand in programs supporting terrorists? Because they seek support from the forces trying to break the country or because they seek interference from foreign powers in the country's democracy?"" Nadda said in the letter.""Because they rail against peace in Jammu and Kashmir or because they support the release of terrorists, talks with Pakistan, trade with Pakistan and reintroduction of Article 370? Because they call Hindus a bigger threat than Pakistani terrorist organizations or because they repeatedly insult Hindu Sanatan culture? Because they demand proof of the bravery of the army personnel or because they term the bravery of the soldiers as 'blood brokering'? That's why they give controversial statements on the turban and bracelets of Sikh brothers?"" he addedKharge, in his letter to PM Modi, had expressed concern over Rahul Gandhi being called ""number one terrorist"" by the BJP leader and Union minister Ravneet Singh Bittu.","BJP chief JP Nadda hit back at Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge's letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

TikTok’s Tanghulu trend: Glass fruit treat turns sour with severe burn injuries among children,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tiktoks-tanghulu-trend-sweet-treat-turns-sour-with-severe-burn-injuries-among-children/articleshow/113507813.cms,"A recent TikTok trend involving the creation of "" glass fruit ,"" also known as Tanghulu , has raised concerns among medical professionals due to the potential for severe burn injuries in children attempting to recreate the recipe at home.The trend involves microwaving a mixture of sugar and water until it boils, then dipping skewered fruit into the hot liquid and allowing it to harden.Shriners Children's Hospital in Boston has reported an increase in cases of children suffering from deep burns caused by spilt sugar during the Tanghulu-making process. Dr Colleen Ryan, a surgeon at the hospital, treated two patients within a two-week period who were injured while attempting the trend, according to Fox News.She explained that melted sugar has a high heat capacity, meaning it can cause more severe burns than other hot liquids, such as soup, due to its unique properties. These burns are often small but deep, and they can occur in critical areas like the hands or face.Dr Ryan and her colleagues, both in the United States and internationally, have observed a rise in these types of injuries related to the cooking trend.She encourages parents to be aware of the potential dangers and to ensure that their children have learned proper cooking safety measures before attempting to recreate the trend at home.Dr Marc Siegel, a senior medical analyst for Fox News and clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center, also warned of the ""contagious"" nature of these viral trends among children and the dangers of melted sugar.In the event that a child does suffer a burn, parents are advised to remove clothing from the affected area, wash the burn with cool water, and seek medical attention if necessary. Blistering indicates a second-degree burn, which may respond to burn creams, while leathery burns that appear black, brown, or white in colour may be third-degree and require immediate medical attention.","The trend involves microwaving a mixture of sugar and water until it boils, then dipping skewered fruit into the hot liquid and allowing it to harden.

Israel, Hezbollah trade strikes

Nasrallah plays down impact

Fear of electronic devices

Deadly Israeli attacks that blew up Hezbollah radios and pagers ""crossed all red lines"", the chief of the heavily armed Iran-backed Lebanese movement said Thursday, in a speech broadcast as sonic booms from Israeli warplanes shook buildings in Beirut.Lebanon and Hezbollah have blamed Israel for attacks on Hezbollah's communications equipment that killed 37 people and wounded around 3,000, overwhelming Lebanese hospitals.Breaking down the toll, Lebanon health minister Firass Abiad said 25 people died and over 600 others were injured in the attack on walkie-talkies on Wednesday. A day earlier, an operation targeting thousands of Hezbollah-owned pagers killed 12 people and injured 2,300 people, Abiad said.Israel has not directly commented on the attacks, which security sources say were probably carried out by its Mossad spy agency, which has a long history of carrying out sophisticated attacks on foreign soil.""There is no doubt that we have been subjected to a major security and military blow that is unprecedented,"" Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said in his TV address, filmed at an undisclosed location. ""The enemy went beyond all controls, laws and morals,"" he said adding the attacks could be considered war crimes or a declaration of war. He said Israel would face ""tough retribution, where it expects it and where it does not"".As the broadcast was aired, deafening sonic booms from Israeli warplanes shook Beirut, a sound that has become common in recent months but has taken on a greater significance as the threat of all-out war has steadily ramped up. The Israeli military said late Thursday that its warplanes struck dozens of Hezbollah targets, including rocket launchers and weapon depots in southern Lebanon. Defence minister Yoav Gallant said Israel will keep up military action against Hezbollah.During Nasrallah's speech, Hezbollah struck at least four times in northern Israel, and two Israeli soldiers were killed in a strike early on Thursday.Though accusing Israel of trying to kill 5,000 people in one go, Nasrallah also played down the impact on Hezbollah, saying the group's structure had not been shaken. ""Yes, we received a big and harsh blow, but this is also the nature of war,"" he said. Nasrallah said the group is investigating the attack.He said Hezbollah will continue its barrages into northern Israel as long as the war in Gaza continues, vowing that Israel will not be able to bring its people back to the border region - a new war goal of Tel Aviv.The attacks sowed fear across Lebanon, with people abandoning electronic devices for fear of carrying bombs. Doctors told AFP of horrific eye injuries and finger amputations caused by the blasts.","Lebanon and Hezbollah have blamed Israel for attacks on Hezbollah's communications equipment that killed 37 people and wounded around 3,000.

"First pagers, now walkie-talkies: Lebanon on edge after new wave of explosions kill 20",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-hezbollah-war-mossad-pager-explosions-walkie-talkies-explosions/articleshow/113474697.cms,"Driving the news

Lebanon has been rocked by a series of devastating explosions over the past two days, leaving at least 26 people dead and thousands more injured.

The two main devices responsible for the carnage — pagers and walkie-talkies—were in widespread use by Hezbollah operatives.

These seemingly mundane objects detonated across the country in a coordinated wave of attacks, with security experts pointing fingers at Israel.

As per a report in Aljazeera, exploding devices include portable two-way radios, laptops, and even certain solar power setups. ""There are reports of several different devices blowing up.""

A number of vehicles have also reportedly burst into flames. However, it remains uncertain whether these explosions originated from the cars themselves or from objects within the vehicles.

The explosions have not only claimed lives but also unleashed panic and chaos as people fear more devices could still be rigged to explode.

Thousands of Lebanese residents have been directly affected by the blasts, which have targeted Hezbollah strongholds in Beirut and southern Lebanon.

At the same time, explosions have hit civilian areas, including shops, homes, and even hospitals. This attack represents the largest security breach in Hezbollah’s history, marking a new phase of violence between Hezbollah and Israel, who have been engaged in escalating hostilities for years.

Why it matters

The scale and sophistication of these attacks have exposed Hezbollah’s vulnerabilities in a way that few anticipated. With Israel being blamed for the operation, the explosions have dramatically heightened tensions in a region already on edge due to ongoing conflicts between Israel, Hamas , and Iran-backed Hezbollah. The attacks have struck fear into Lebanese civilians, many of whom are now terrified that everyday devices could explode at any moment.

, and Iran-backed Hezbollah. The attacks have struck fear into Lebanese civilians, many of whom are now terrified that everyday devices could explode at any moment. As per a news report from Reuters, Israel’s intelligence agency, Mossad , was behind serial explosions in pagers.

, was behind serial explosions in pagers. The orchestration of the pager bombings seemed to be an intricate undertaking that required several months of preparation. Numerous specialists suspect that Mossad tampered with the supply chain, planting explosives in hundreds of pagers prior to their importation into Lebanon. However, concrete evidence supporting this theory remains scarce at present.

Gold Apollo , a company based in Taiwan, said that it granted permission to BAC Consulting KFT, a firm located in Hungary, to utilize its name on the pagers shipped to Hezbollah. However, Zoltán Kovács, a spokesperson for the Hungarian government, announced on Wednesday that the pagers delivered to Hezbollah never entered Hungary and that BAC Consultants simply served as a mediator in the transaction.

However, Zoltán Kovács, a spokesperson for the Hungarian government, announced on Wednesday that the pagers delivered to Hezbollah never entered Hungary and that BAC Consultants simply served as a mediator in the transaction. Kovács further disclosed on X that Hungary's national security services were actively collaborating with international partners in the investigation.

The chaos unleashed by these attacks threatens to destabilize Lebanon further, a country already grappling with economic collapse, political turmoil, and the lingering aftermath of the 2020 Beirut port explosion.

The big picture

The attacks began when thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah exploded almost simultaneously across Lebanon and parts of Syria, killing 12 people and injuring nearly 3,000.

The next day, a second wave of explosions from walkie-talkies and solar panels caused more devastation, killing 14 more and wounding hundreds. Lebanese media have reported that some of the dead include children and civilians who were nowhere near Hezbollah operations at the time of the explosions.

Hezbollah officials have publicly condemned Israel, accusing it of committing “mass murder.” Iran, Hezbollah’s chief backer, has also blamed Israel and vowed retribution. Meanwhile, Israel has remained tight-lipped but has declared the start of a ""new phase"" in its ongoing war with Hezbollah, raising fears of a broader conflict involving Iran and its allies.

In a Daily Mail report, journalist Hassan Harfoush shared chilling firsthand accounts of the devastation. ""The scenes here in Lebanon are from a horror film—fleshless faces, eyes hanging out. With dozens dead and thousands hurt, none of us feel safe,"" he wrote.

""Beirut has collapsed into panic. The WhatsApp groups are going non-stop. There are wild rumours doing the rounds that solar panels might explode, batteries, fridges – anything. There's fake news saying phones have exploded. I know it's stupid but I even told my parents to get a fire extinguisher, just in case ­something blows up in the house,"" Harfoush wrote in the Daily Mail, echoing the fear that has swept the country.

What they are saying

Lebanese residents, gripped by panic, have taken drastic steps to protect themselves. Some have begun tearing the batteries out of their walkie-talkies and throwing them into the streets, terrified that the devices could explode at any moment. In some areas, residents have turned off Wi-Fi routers and unplugged home appliances out of fear they could also be rigged to detonate.

At Beirut hospitals, doctors are struggling to keep up with the flood of patients. ""We are seeing horrific injuries,"" said Dr Elias Warrak, an ophthalmologist at Mount Lebanon University Hospital. ""In the last 24 hours, we’ve had more than 60 to 70 percent of patients needing at least one eye removed."" Many of the injuries involve gruesome shrapnel wounds to the face, hands, and eyes, leaving many permanently disfigured.

At a funeral for victims of the first wave of explosions, panic struck again when walkie-talkies detonated during the ceremony. Attendees fled in terror as ambulances rushed to the scene. ""The Hezbollah officials present behaved as if nothing had happened, but all of us felt it, heard it,"" Harfoush recalled. This latest wave of violence has shattered any remaining sense of security in Beirut and beyond.

Zoom in

The Lebanese armed forces have been called in to conduct controlled explosions of any suspicious devices. In one instance, soldiers detonated a bag of rice at the American University of Beirut Medical Centre, fearing it had been rigged with explosives. The Lebanese army is also working to neutralize compromised solar panels and radios, but the sheer number of devices in circulation makes the task daunting.

Images of exploded walkie-talkies and pagers show them labeled with “ICOM” and “Made in Japan.” While the devices appear to be from the Japanese electronics firm ICOM, the company has denied any involvement, saying that the specific models used in the attacks were discontinued in 2014. Taiwanese firm Gold Apollo has also distanced itself, saying that its pagers had been licensed to a Hungarian company, BAC Consulting, which acted as an intermediary.

Between the lines

Experts believe the devices were likely tampered with before they were delivered to Hezbollah, indicating a long-term infiltration of the group’s supply chain. Some security sources have suggested that small explosives were hidden inside the devices and remotely triggered, possibly through radio frequencies. This level of sophistication suggests the involvement of a state actor, with Israel’s Mossad being the most likely culprit.

The psychological impact of the explosions has been devastating. ""People used to think that if they were affiliated with Hezbollah but not fighters, they were safe. But this changes everything,"" said a Hezbollah source. Civilians who once believed they were outside the conflict’s direct line of fire are now terrified that their homes, shops, or workplaces could become the next target.

What’s next

The situation remains highly volatile, with Hezbollah vowing to retaliate. Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is expected to make a public address, possibly outlining the group’s plans for retaliation.

Meanwhile, Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant has warned that Israel is just beginning its ""new phase"" of war, which could see more aggressive military actions in the coming days.

There is a growing fear that the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah could escalate into a full-scale regional war, drawing in other countries such as Iran and Syria. Meanwhile, residents in Lebanon are left wondering whether any electronic device could be the next to explode.

Lebanon is reeling from a second wave of deadly explosions targeting electronic devices used by Hezbollah , just a day after hundreds of the militant group's pagers detonated simultaneously. The latest attacks, which are widely believed to have been carried out by Israel, have heightened fears of an all-out war between the two sides. The explosions have also raised concerns about the extent of potentially compromised devices, especially given the high number of civilian casualties.(With inputs from agencies)","Lebanon has been rocked by a series of devastating explosions over the past two days, leaving at least 26 people dead and thousands more injured.

North Carolina Republican gubernatorial nominee Mark Robinson has pledged to continue his campaign despite a CNN report alleging he made racially and sexually offensive comments online over a decade ago. Robinson, who is currently the lieutenant governor, dismissed the report as “salacious tabloid lies” and vowed to fight on.On Thursday, Robinson addressed the allegations in a video posted on social media platform X.He strongly denied the claims, asserting that the comments attributed to him do not reflect his character or beliefs. “Let me reassure you the things that you will see in that story — those are not the words of Mark Robinson,” he said.The CNN report detailed comments Robinson allegedly posted on a pornography website forum, including derogatory remarks about civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and self-references that CNN described as problematic. Robinson is reported to have expressed disturbing views about women and transgender issues. CNN matched details of the online account to Robinson’s known information, but the Associated Press has not verified these claims independently.The report has intensified scrutiny of Robinson, who has trailed Democratic nominee Josh Stein in recent polls. Stein has labelled Robinson as too extreme for the governorship, citing past inflammatory statements. Robinson's campaign has been further complicated by potential negative impacts on other Republican candidates in North Carolina, including former President Donald Trump , who has previously endorsed Robinson.The scandal surrounding Robinson could threaten Trump’s prospects in the 2024 election, with North Carolina being a critical battleground state. Republican pollster Paul Shumaker expressed concerns that the controversy could damage Trump’s standing, asking, “Does Mark Robinson cost Donald Trump the White House?”Trump's campaign has distanced itself from Robinson following the report. Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt emphasised a focus on the presidential race, without addressing Robinson directly. In contrast, the North Carolina Republican Party defended Robinson, accusing the left of attempting to tarnish his reputation through personal attacks.Robinson has been a prominent figure in Trump’s efforts to win over Black voters and has appeared alongside the former president at multiple rallies. However, the allegations of antisemitism and offensive comments now cast a shadow over Trump’s campaign, potentially undermining his outreach efforts and alienating key voter blocs.On social media, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ campaign seized on the controversy. Her spokesperson Ammar Moussa reposted a photo of Trump with Robinson, stating, “Donald Trump has a Mark Robinson problem.”","North Carolina Republican gubernatorial nominee Mark Robinson has pledged to continue his campaign.

Shooting: Manhunt ends: YouTube couple finds Kentucky highway shooter's body in wilderness,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/manhunt-ends-search-for-kentucky-highway-shooter-concludes-as-youtube-couple-discovers-body-in-wilderness/articleshow/113501254.cms,"A days-long manhunt for a gunman who opened fire on cars along Kentucky ’s Interstate 75 came to an end when a YouTuber couple Fred and Sheila McCoy searching the wilderness stumbled upon a decomposing body believed to be the suspect, Joseph Couch .The manhunt began after Couch, 32, allegedly shot at 12 vehicles from a cliff on September 7, injuring five people.According to the authorities, Couch sent text messages to a woman before the shooting indicating he intended to kill multiple people and then take his own life, as reported by CNN US.The attack caused widespread fear in the surrounding communities, prompting school closures and business lockdowns as law enforcement warned residents to avoid the wilderness of the Daniel Boone National Forest.For nearly two weeks, authorities searched the rugged terrain of the Daniel Boone National Forest, which spans an area larger than Los Angeles and New York City combined.They used helicopters, drones, and search dogs, but could not locate Couch.His vehicle, with an empty gun case inside, was found near a forest service road, along with an AR-15 believed to be used in the shooting.Tips poured in from several states, and a $35,000 reward was offered for information leading to his arrest.Five days into the search, Fred and Sheila McCoy, a couple from the area, joined the effort, hoping to aid in Couch’s capture.While they were on a livestream they noticed vultures circling above a remote area and followed a strong odour of decay.The McCoys posted a live YouTube video around 3:30 pm claiming they’d found Couch’s body after searching for six days and nights. They soon encountered two Kentucky State Police troopers in the same location, and together they discovered the decomposing body.Although the body has not yet been officially identified, authorities are confident it is Couch, based on articles found near the scene.Kentucky State Police Commissioner Phillip Burnett Jr. announced the discovery, expressing relief that the search had concluded. ""The people of Laurel County can rest much easier knowing that this manhunt has come to an end,"" Burnett said. An autopsy will be conducted to confirm the identity and determine the cause of death.Couch had been charged with five counts of attempted murder and five counts of first-degree assault. His motive for the shooting remains unknown, though authorities continue to investigate.Laurel County Sheriff John Root expressed regret that Couch wasn’t found alive, saying, “I’d rather he’d been alive, and he could have paid for what he’d done.”Fred and Sheila McCoy are expected to receive a $15,000 reward from Laurel County Crime Stoppers and an additional $10,000 from a private donor for their role in locating the suspect.","Joseph Couch, 32, allegedly shot at 12 vehicles from a cliff on September 7, injuring five people.

US Presidential Elections: US elections: Muslim Americans turn to Jill Steins in big blow to Kamala Harris,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-elections-muslim-americans-turn-to-jill-steins-in-big-blow-to-kamala-harris/articleshow/113500517.cms,"In the 2024 presidential race , Green Party candidate Jill Stein is posing a potential threat to Harris’ chances in key battleground states.Arab-American and Muslim voters are visibly frustrated with Vice President Kamala Harris , largely due to the Biden administration’s unwavering support for Israel’s military offensive in Gaza. This dissatisfaction is driving many voters toward third-party Green Party candidate Jill Stein.A poll conducted in late August by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) highlights this shift.In Michigan, a state with a significant Arab-American population, 40% of Muslim voters now support Jill Stein. In contrast, Vice President Kamala Harris has only 12% of the Muslim vote, while Republican candidate Donald Trump receives 18% support.Stein’s support also extends to other battleground states with sizable Muslim populations, such as Arizona and Wisconsin.Muslim voters were a crucial part of Biden’s coalition in 2020 when he secured over 80% of their vote. However, their support for Democrats has sharply declined amid ongoing US backing of Israel in its nearly year-long campaign in Gaza.Kamala Harris recently called for an end to the Israel-Gaza war, and the return of hostages held by Hamas, and supported a two-state solution. However, her campaign continues to support US arms shipments to Israel, which has upset many Muslim and Arab-American leaders who want an arms embargo or restrictions.Jill Stein’s campaign has taken advantage of this discontent. Stein has called for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, a US arms embargo on Israel, and backing student movements to divest from weapons makers. Her running mate, a Muslim professor Butch Ware, also appeals to Muslim voters.Despite getting just over 1% of the vote in 2016, Stein’s strong stance on Gaza has made her a key figure among pro-Palestinian supporters.Stein recently headlined ArabCon in Dearborn, Michigan, and was featured on the cover of ‘The Arab American News’ under the headline “The Choice 2024.” Her slogan, “Every vote cast for our campaign is a vote against genocide,” has resonated with Muslim voters deeply frustrated by US foreign policy.Meanwhile, the Trump campaign is actively courting Arab-American and Muslim voters, hosting in-person and virtual events in Michigan and Arizona. Trump has promised to broker more Arab-Israeli peace deals, presenting himself as the candidate who can achieve peace faster than Harris.Though Stein’s campaign is unlikely to win the election, her rising popularity among Muslim voters could cut off enough support from Harris to affect the outcome in key battleground states.In a tight race, these shifting dynamics could prove decisive, as they did in the 2016 election, when some Democrats blamed third-party votes for Hillary Clinton's loss.","In Michigan, a state with a significant Arab-American population, 40% of Muslim voters now support Jill Stein.

Ohio officials approve language saying anti-gerrymandering measure calls for the opposite,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ohio-officials-approve-language-saying-anti-gerrymandering-measure-calls-for-the-opposite/articleshow/113499860.cms,"COLUMBUS: Ohio election officials have approved ballot language that will describe this fall’s Issue 1, a redistricting measure, as requiring gerrymandering when the proposal is intended to do the opposite.The Republican-controlled Ohio Ballot Board approved the language Wednesday in a 3-2 party-line vote, two days after the Republican-led state Supreme Court voted 4-3 to correct various defects the justices found in what the board had already passed.The high court ordered two of eight disputed sections of the ballot description to be rewritten while upholding the other six the issue’s backers had contested. The court’s three Democratic justices dissented.Citizens Not Politicians , the group behind the Nov. 5 amendment, sued last month, asserting the language “may be the most biased, inaccurate, deceptive, and unconstitutional” the state has ever seen.The bipartisan coalition’s proposal calls for replacing Ohio’s troubled political map-making system with a 15-member, citizen-led commission of Republicans, Democrats and independents. The proposal emerged after seven different versions of congressional and legislative maps created after the 2020 Census were declared unconstitutionally gerrymandered to favor Republicans.State Sen. Paula Hicks-Hudson, D-Toledo, one of the two Democrats who sit on the ballot board, told reporters after it met that “this was done and it was created for the main purpose of hoodwinking voters.” Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose, who chairs the board, did not take questions from the press after the vote.In Monday’s opinion, the high court’s majority noted that it can only invalidate language approved by the ballot board if it finds the wording would “mislead, deceive, or defraud the voters.” The majority found most of the language included in the approved summary and title didn’t do that but merely described the extensive amendment in detail.The two sections that justices said were mischaracterized involve when a lawsuit would be able to be filed challenging the new commission’s redistricting plan and the ability of the public to provide input on the map-making process.The exact language of the constitutional amendment will be posted at polling locations.",Ohio Ballot Board approved the language Wednesday in a 3-2 party-line vote.

The LAFD set up floating barriers to prevent debris and diesel fuel from polluting the marina waters. As the yacht began listing, officials evacuated the dock.Eyewitnesses captured footage of fireworks exploding from the yacht as thick black smoke filled the air. Residents nearby feared that the fire would spread to other boats docked in the area.“I saw it fully engulfed in flames, heard an explosion, and saw fireworks going off. It was terrifying,” said local resident Lynn Rose.The yacht sank at around 10:30 pm, although the fire continued to burn below deck. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.The Admiral, built in 1986 by Broward Marine, was last listed for sale in 2018 for $985,000.

"As polls show Kamala edging ahead, desperate Trump digs deep into denialism -- and fantasy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/as-polls-show-kamala-edging-ahead-desperate-trump-digs-deep-into-denialism-and-fantasy/articleshow/113499206.cms,"WASHINGTON: A popular meme circulating online shows a schoolkid telling his teacher ""the dog ate my homework and an immigrant ate my dog."" With a growing roster of polls showing Kamala Harris edging ahead in the Presidential election, both nationwide and in battleground states, the Trump campaign is building redundancies into its election denialism , proffering a range of excuses from ""fake polls,"" to Iranian interference to help Democrats, to illegal immigrants being enrolled to vote.A survey released Wednesday by the Trump-leaning Fox News shows Harris leading the MAGA supremo 50-48 in nationwide polls, the first time the Democratic candidate has touched 50 per cent. A separate set of polls by a NewYorkTimes-led consortium shows them tied 48-48, but puts Harris ahead 50-46 in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania. Another Quinnipiac University poll put Harris 51-45 ahead in Pennsylvania and by lesser margins in Michigan and Wisconsin. Polls by Washington Post and CBS News also puts Harris ahead by three to four points nationwide and a Cook political report shows Harris edging ahead in almost all battleground states.All polls show Harris has either caught up or edged ahead of Trump, and none show Trump improving his numbers from the time he led comfortably when Joe Biden was his opponent.The Trump camp's response? The polls are ""fake"" and aimed at demoralizing Republicans. ""Consistently, what you've seen in 2016 and 2020 is that the media uses fake polls to drive down Republican turnout and to create dissension and conflict with Republican voters,"" Trump's running mate JD Vance told Fox News, characterizing Harris' numbers ticking up as a ""sugar high,"" that would level off. ""The Trump campaign is in a very, very good spot. We're going to win this race; we just have to run through the finish line,"" he added.Trump himself seized on reports of Iranian cyber activists trying to mess with US elections to claim that that the FBI caught Iran spying on his campaign and ""giving all the information to the Harris campaign,"" although the FBI said they had sent unsolicited emails to individuals then associated with President Biden’s campaign in June and July. ""THEREFORE SHE AND HER CAMPAIGN WERE ILLEGALLY SPYING ON ME. TO BE KNOWN AS THE IRAN, IRAN, IRAN CASE! WILL KAMALA RESIGN IN DISGRACE FROM POLITICS? WILL THE COMMUNIST LEFT PICK A NEW CANDIDATE TO REPLACE HER?"" Trump trolled in an effort to discredit the polls and disenfranchise his rival.The MAGA supremo also made an audacious effort to stir New Yorkers into voting for him with a raucous rally in Long Island, claiming, as he did in California, that the state was ripe for picking because Democrats had diminished the state. Both California and New York last voted Republican during the Reagan era and are now considered reliably Democratic (by around +20) to an extent neither party campaigns there. Candidates only go there for fund-raising or to campaign for Congressional candidates, which is what Trump was doing, although he used the occasion to talk up an improbable victory in his inimitable style, telling New Yorkers to ""get off your ass and vote for me.""Lagging in the polls, the Trump campaign has raised the tempo of its narrative on illegal immigrants to whip up it nativists base, including doubling down on the ""Haitians eating pets"" canard that originated in Springfield, Ohio, last week. Despite Ohio's GOP governor and Republican officials in Springfield telling the Trump-Vance campaign officials -- who called them to check on the story -- that it was baseless, Vance continues to peddle the story, arguing that it is legit to ""create"" such stories to draw attention to the illegal immigrant issue, which in his view, is diminishing the quality of life for Americans.","A growing roster of polls show Kamala Harris edging ahead in the Presidential election, both nationwide and in battleground states.

Hello and welcome to US Presidential Election Top 10: your daily guide to the Trump vs Harris battle royale.Whenever Iranian attempts to spread disinformation in America make the news, one is reminded of the CGI extravaganza called 300. A major blockbuster in WENA (Western Europe and Northern America), the film remains in the cultural zeitgeist due to Leonidas’ chiselled abs and the “This is Sparta” meme.Despite its widespread popularity, one country that was understandably upset was Iran, which detested the horrendous portrayal of ancient Persians and their legendary king Xerxes.In 2007, Michael White of The Guardian wrote: “In a way that is now rare, this film uses its comic book dimension to portray the beastly Spartans, their disturbingly militarised society, as democratic. As for the Persians, Xerxes himself, black, half-naked, adorned with gold and jewels, looks and talks like the kind of drug dealer you wouldn’t want to upset. No wonder the government and people of Iran took offence. They were justified in doing so.”Many Iranians even believed that the movie was secretly funded by the US government to prepare Americans for potential conflict with Iran. Perhaps that’s why Iran continues to meddle in American affairs with the same zeal that America has always meddled in global affairs.In September 2024, US intelligence agencies revealed that Iranian hackers had attempted to interfere in the upcoming presidential election by stealing non-public material from Donald Trump ’s campaign and sending it to individuals linked to President Joe Biden’s re-election team. According to the FBI, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, thiscyberattack was part of Iran’s broader effort to sow discord and undermine confidence in the US electoral process.Donald Trump posted on Truth Social: “WOW, JUST OUT! The FBI caught Iran spying on my campaign and handing over all the information to the Kamala Harris campaign. This means she and her campaign were illegally spying on me. This will be known as the IRAN, IRAN, IRAN CASE! Will Kamala resign in disgrace from politics? Will the Communist left pick a new candidate to replace her?”A spokesperson for the Harris campaign stated: ""We’re not aware of any material being sent directly to the campaign. A few individuals were targeted on their personal emails with what appeared to be spam or phishing attempts.""The stolen materials, whose exact nature remains undisclosed, were sent to various US media outlets and political entities in an attempt to influence the election. The Biden campaign, however, did not engage with the hackers or respond to the stolen material. The cyberattack highlights Iran’s ongoing efforts to interfere in US elections, a strategy they’ve employed since at least 2020.This incident is part of a broader pattern of foreign cyber interference in US elections. A report from Microsoft revealed that Iranian hackers, specifically linked to a group known as Storm-2035 , had engaged in sophisticated cyber operations, including spear-phishing attacks, targeting senior officials in the Trump campaign. These cyber efforts aim to influence both sides of the US political spectrum by spreading disinformation on controversial topics such as LGBTQ rights, the Israel-Hamas conflict, and other divisive issues.One notable aspect of Iran’s approach is the use of covert news sites, such as “Nio Thinker” and “Savannah Time,” which appeal to opposite ends of the US political spectrum. These sites amplify polarising messages and seek to engage voters, particularly in swing states, to sway public opinion and stir controversy ahead of the election.Nio Thinker, in particular, ran sarcastic articles mocking Donald Trump, referring to him as an ""opioid-pilled elephant in the MAGA China shop"" and a ""raving mad litigiosaur.""These disinformation campaigns are often powered by AI-enabled services, allowing Iranian actors to plagiarise content from legitimate US news outlets, rephrasing and amplifying these messages to suit their political objectives. Microsoft’s report highlights how these tactics are designed to obscure the original sources of the content and drive traffic to Iranian-controlled websites.Further complicating the situation, Trump’s campaign confirmed that internal communications had been hacked, aligning with Microsoft’s findings on Iranian cyber activities.This latest incident adds to the long history of tension between the US and Iran, who seem to view Trump’s return to the presidency with more distaste. During his presidency, Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA) in 2018, reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran, and initiated a ""maximum pressure"" campaign to force Tehran to renegotiate. His administration also escalated military tensions by authorising the assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in 2020 and designating the IRGC as a terrorist organisation. Despite expressing a willingness for a new deal, no diplomatic breakthrough was achieved, and US-Iran relations remained highly strained.While Iran’s meddling in the US election is not surprising – even China and Russia have done so in the past – in this new age of disinformation, it seems what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.Here are 10 other stories to keep track of:","Microsoft warns of a ‘most perilous moment ahead’ of the US Presidential election.

Melania Trump ’s absence from Donald’s campaign has led to speculations about the possible tension between the couple.The presence of Kari Lake is adding fuel to the rumours. Lake is a former Arizona gubernatorial candidate, who, like Trump, has claimed her Arizona governor election was rigged, she has reportedly spent considerable time at Mar-a-Lago with Donald, leading to whispers of discomfort for Melania, as quoted by Inquisitr.On ‘The Daily Beast’ podcast ‘The New Abnormal,’ reporter Zach Petrizzo discussed an article from the People Magazine titled, “Kari Lake Appears at Mar-a-Lago More than Melania Trump and ‘Practically Lives’ In A Suite.”Petrizzo said that these types of headlines reportedly irritate the former first lady. Trump often reviews stacks of articles, many of which he discards. However, stories involving Melania tend to get extra attention, as they directly impact her and Donald's personal life.According to Petrizzo, Donald and Melania regularly have dinners together, but Melania and her team are well aware of the public attention, and this particular story did not sit well with her.Meanwhile, during a recent rally in Tucson, Arizona, Trump has been showering praise on Lake, giving her a new nickname. Praising her stance on border issues, Trump referred to her as “Border Kari Lake.” He said, “She’s tough on the border, so from now on I’m going to call her Border Kari Lake. She’s a fantastic person... tough, tough, tough on the border.”Trump reiterated the nickname later in his speech, saying, “Border Kari Lake, thank you. I’m giving her a take, and when I give people takes, it stays. She’s going to be great.” Lake is running for the Arizona Senate seat currently held by Kyrsten Sinema.Rumours about a potential rift between Donald and Melania surfaced after Lake’s increasing presence at Mar-a-Lago last year, especially after Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign .However, Lake’s senior adviser dismissed the allegations, calling them ‘ridiculous.’ He said, ""Kari Lake often speaks at events all over the country in support of America First candidates and organizations; and when she does have the honour of being invited to speak at the beautiful Mar-a-Lago, she overnights at Hilton properties in Palm Beach with her loving husband of 25 years.""","Kari Lake is a former Arizona gubernatorial candidate.

The move comes after the couple petitioned the Islamabad High Court to stay the proceedings and sought acquittal.The Al-Qadir Trust case centers on accusations that Khan and his wife caused a loss of over Rs 50 billion to the national exchequer.An anti-corruption court has been overseeing the trial, where so far, the statements of 35 witnesses have been recorded, leaving only the investigating officer to be cross-examined by the defense.A two-member bench headed by Chief Justice Amir Farooq heard the plea on Wednesday. Although the bench rejected the request to completely halt the legal proceedings, it granted relief by restraining the accountability court from issuing a final verdict.Khan and Bibi's lawyers argued that recent amendments in anti-corruption laws make the charges against the former prime minister and his wife invalid. They contended that the approval of the federal cabinet was involved in the matter, and the revised laws make it clear that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) cannot investigate decisions made by the cabinet.""The case does not stand after the new amendments, and we seek acquittal for our clients,"" argued the defense.The court has issued notices to the involved parties, and the trial remains ongoing.

The amount had been part of a settlement with the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) and later adjusted against a Supreme Court fine imposed on Hussain.","Former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, seek acquittal.

Shiva Kachi, a Hindu community leader from Hyderabad, said, ""We are getting information about such incidents nearly every week now from different parts of the province and no one seems to care.There is so much fear in the Hindu community now.""Kachi heads the Pakistan Darewar Ittehad , an organisation which is fighting for the recovery of Hindu girls kidnapped, allegedly forcibly converted to Islam and married off to Muslim men who are much older in many instances.In the recent days there have been two incidents in Khairpur and Mirpurkhas of two girls being abducted from their homes by armed men, he said.In the first instance, a 16-year-old girl was kidnapped from her home in Khairpur while a class 7th student was abducted from Digri town near Mirpurkhas.Kachi said in the first case, a Muslim youth claimed she eloped with him and married him after converting to Islam.He said the Pakistan government and provincial authorities needed to place safeguards to ensure the safety of the Hindu community.Ramesh Kumar, a social activist from Hyderabad city, claims once the girls are abducted, even the police don't cooperate and refuse to file FIRs on behalf of the affected families who are mostly uneducated and poor.""There is a nexus between some clerics, policemen and influential Muslims and the Hindu community suffers,"" he claimed.Hindus are not the only minority who claim they are discriminated against and face injustice. On Tuesday, an Ahmadi family (Ahmadiyyas are declared non-Muslims in Pakistan) saw their under-construction house vandalised in Karachi's Shah Faisal colony.""Everything was okay. We've been constructing the house for the last few months but yesterday someone spread the rumour that Ahmadis were building a worship place and today a mob came and badly damaged the under-construction building,"" Shahid Ahmed said.In many instances, the 500,000-strong Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan don't reveal themselves openly for fear of repercussions.Kumar also referred to the incident of firing in a Hindu temple, Rama Par, in Hyderabad city and said so far the police were delaying arresting all those responsible for entering the temple and opening fire during a religious ceremony.Scores of Hindus held a protest on Monday in Hyderabad demanding the arrest of those responsible for the alleged assault on the temple in which five people were injured.""Police have filed complaints against 11 people but made just two arrests,"" he said.A religious ceremony was taking place at the temple when a scuffle broke out between two groups of the Hindu community and this led to the involvement of outsiders who came and opened fire in the temple while the ceremony had not finished.","Two Hindu girls have been abducted from their homes in Pakistan's southern Sindh province in recent days.

Militants in Pakistan used PUBG features to attack police station,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/militants-in-pakistan-used-pubg-features-to-attack-police-station/articleshow/113390618.cms,"Militants in Swat , Pakistan, utilized features from the popular video game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds ( PUBG ) to plan and execute an attack on a local police station, reported Dawn.Militants targeted the Banr police station in Swat on August 28, resulting in the death of one police officer and injuries to two others. In response, district police initiated an investigation, analyzing CCTV footage from various surveillance cameras to identify the militants responsible for the attack.The militants used PUBG's chat room as a means of communication to evade electronic surveillance, making it difficult for authorities to monitor their activities.Zahidullah, the district police officer of Swat, revealed that while investigators initially focused on a motorcycle seen in CCTV footage near the police station prior to the explosion, their efforts to identify the nature of the attack were complicated. He said police found one person using a mobile phone and they believed that it would help them to hunt down the militants. However, militants never called each other but utilised features of PUBG to avoid being traced, he added.“The militants would play PUBG to practice and motivate their group members for battle against the state and would use the chat room for communication,” Dawn quoted Zahidullah as saying.The investigation ultimately revealed that the attackers had employed an improvised explosive device (IED) constructed from a power bank, rather than a hand grenade, as initially suspected.CCTV footage led to the identification of one suspect, which subsequently resulted in the arrest of additional suspects who disclosed their affiliation with a local militant group, Murad alias Rehmatullah, associated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan .The arrested suspects admitted to maintaining communication with their group and family members in Afghanistan through PUBG chat rooms, frequently changing mobile phones and SIM cards to avoid detection.","Militants targeted a police station in Swat, Pakistan, on August 28, killing one officer.
