Bhinde is currently being transported to Mumbai.On May 13, a 120 x 120 sq ft, weighing 250 tonnes, a Ego Media Private Limited's hoarding fell onto a busy petrol pump, trapping nearly 100 people underneath.Sixteen people lost their lives in the incident, and 75 others were injured.The collapse occurred after a sudden dust storm and rain, with winds reaching up to 60kmph, which the IMD classified as pre-monsoon activity. The NDRF, MMRDA, and other teams conducted a rescue operation, using heavy machinery to extricate victims trapped in the wreckage.Bhinde, the director of the advertising agency was held responsible for the collapsed hoarding which was said to be erected without permission from the BMC. Thus, he was booked for violating BMC rules related to billboards, including cutting/poisoning trees blocking his hoardings. Mumbai police had conducted a search at the residence of Bhavesh Bhinde in Mulund on Monday but he was untraceable.BMC also discovered that Ego Media Pvt Ltd had erected eight additional hoardings in the area without obtaining the necessary permissions from the civic body and issued notice against them. It was revealed that the land parcels on which these hoardings were illegally erected are registered under the ownership of the home department and the Maharashtra state police housing welfare corporation, violating Section 328 of the BMC Act, 1888.Apart from the hoarding collapse case, Bhinde has more than 20 cases registered against him, including a rape case.Bhinde had contested as an Independent candidate in the state elections, representing the Mulund constituency in 2009. As part of the electoral process, he submitted an affidavit that revealed that he had 23 legal cases against him. These cases were filed under various legislative acts, including the ""Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act"" and the ""Negotiable Instruments Act,"" the latter of which pertains to instances of bounced cheques.(With agency inputs)","Mumbai police arrest Bhavesh Bhinde, owner of the firm which put up the hoarding that caused the death of 16 people from Udaipur.

ED can't arrest accused once court takes cognisance of complaint: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-cant-arrest-accused-once-court-takes-cognisance-of-complaint-sc/articleshow/110187365.cms,"NEW DELHI: Reducing the rigour of Prevention of Money Laundering Act proceedings, Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that Enforcement Directorate officials have no power to arrest an accused if he had not been arrested before the special court took cognisance of the complaint.""Once cognisance is taken of the offence punishable under Section 4 of PMLA, the special court is seized of the matter.After cognisance is taken, ED officials cannot exercise the power of arrest of the accused,"" a bench of Justices A S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said in what could disarm ED of the special powers it enjoys under Section 45 of PMLA.Writing the judgment, Justice Oka said once the special court takes cognisance, ED loses the power to arrest the accused, who in turn cannot apply for anticipatory bail. Accepting arguments of senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, who appeared for accused persons not arrested by ED in a PMLA case and whose anticipatory bail pleas were rejected by high court, the bench said if an accused was not arrested till the filing of the complaint by ED, then the special court would only issue summons to him and not an arrest warrant at the first instance.If ED wants custody of the accused who appears following summons, the agency will have to apply to the special court, which would pass appropriate orders with reasons after hearing the accused, SC said.Luthra pointed out that certain special courts took the accused into custody after they appeared pursuant to summons issued, forcing them to apply for anticipatory bail.The bench said, ""Such a practice, if followed by some special courts, is completely illegal as it may offend the right to liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.""Significantly, SC said, ""If the accused appears before the special court pursuant to summons, he shall not be treated as if he is in custody. Therefore, it is not necessary for him to apply for bail. However, the special court can direct the accused to furnish bond to ensure he appears before the court on proceeding dates.""",The Supreme Court ruled that Enforcement Directorate officials have no power to arrest an accused if he had not been arrested before the special court took cognisance of the complaint.

The impact caused the bridge to partially collapse and cut off the only road connecting Galveston to Pelican Island, the Coast Guard said.Video shows splotches of oil had spilled from the barge into Galveston Bay. Jeff Davis of the Texas General Land Office said during a news conference Thursday that early cleanup efforts have not identified any impacted wildlife.The barge has the capacity to hold 30,000 barrels, but was holding 23,000 barrels - approximately 966,000 gallons - when it struck the bridge, Rick Freed, the vice president of barge operator Martin Marine, said at the news conference. Freed said the only tank that was compromised in the crash was holding approximately 160,000 gallons, which is the ""complete risk.""""We're pretty confident there was much less oil introduced to the water than we initially estimated,"" Coast Guard Capt. Keith Donohue said.""We've recovered over 605 gallons of oily water mixture from the environment, as well as an additional 5,640 gallons of oil product from the top of the barge that did not go into the water,"" Donohue said.The Coast Guard said earlier that it had deployed a boom, or barrier, to contain the spill, which forced the closure of about 6.5 miles (10.5 kilometers) of the waterway.A tugboat lost control of the 321-foot barge ""due to a break in the coupling"" that had connected the two vessels, the Coast Guard said.""Weather was not a factor, at all, during the coupling issue,"" Freed said. When pressed for more details on how the two vessels became disconnected, he said: ""It's under investigation right now, and I really can't disclose anything further until the investigation is through.""On Thursday, the barge remained beside the bridge, weighed in place by debris including rail lines that fell onto it after the crash.The bridge, which provides the only road access between Galveston and Pelican Island, remained closed to incoming traffic, but vehicles leaving Pelican Island and pedestrians in both directions were able to cross.Texas A&M University at Galveston, which has a campus on Pelican Island, urged staff and faculty to leave and said it was closing the campus, although essential personnel would remain.""Given the rapidly changing conditions and uncertainty regarding the outage of the Pelican Island Bridge, the Galveston Campus administration will be relocating all Texas A&M Pelican Island residents,"" through at least Sunday, it said in a statement late Wednesday.Fewer than 200 people related to the school were on the island when the barge hit the bridge. Spokesperson Shantelle Patterson-Swanson said the university would provide transportation and cover the housing costs of those who choose to leave, but underlined that the school has not issued a mandatory evacuation.Aside from the environmental impact of the oil spill , the region is unlikely to see large economic disruption as a result of the accident, said Maria Burns, a maritime transportation expert at the University of Houston.The affected area is miles from the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, which sees frequent barge traffic, and the Houston Ship Channel, a large shipping channel for ocean-going vessels.The accident came weeks after a cargo ship crashed into a support column of the Francis Key Bridge in Baltimore on March 26, killing six construction workers.","Early estimates indicate up to 2,000 gallons of oil may have spilled into surrounding waters.

Texas governor pardons ex-Army sergeant convicted of killing Black Lives Matter protester,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/texas-governor-pardons-ex-army-sergeant-convicted-of-killing-black-lives-matter-protester/articleshow/110188106.cms,"AUSTIN: Texas governor Greg Abbott issued a full pardon Thursday for a former US Army sergeant convicted of murder for fatally shooting an armed demonstrator in 2020 during nationwide protests against police violence and racial injustice.Abbott announced the pardon just a few minutes after the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles announced that it unanimously recommended that Daniel Perry be pardoned and have his firerams rights restored.Perry has been held in state prison on a 25-year sentence since his conviction in 2023 in the killing of Garrett Foster.Abbott, a Republican, had previously previously ordered the board to review Perry's case and said he would sign a pardon if recommended. Under Texas law, the governor cannot issue a pardon without a recommendation from the board, which the governor appoints.""Texas has one of the strongest 'Stand Your Ground' laws of self-defense that cannot be nullified by a jury or a progressive district attorney,"" Abbott said.Travis County district attorney Jose Garza blasted the pardon as a ""mockery of our legal system.""""The board and the governor have put their politics over justice,"" Garza said. ""They should be ashamed of themselves. Their actions are contrary to the law and demonstrate that there are two classes of people in this state where some lives matter and some lives do not. They have sent a message to Garrett Foster's family, to his partner, and to our community that his life does not matter. ""Abbott's demand for a review of Perry's case followed pressure from former Fox News star Tucker Carlson, who on national television had urged the governor to intervene after the sergeant was convicted at trial in April 2023. Perry was sentenced after prosecutors used his social media history and text messages to portray him as a racist who may commit violence again.Prosecutors argued Perry could have driven away without opening fire and witnesses testified that they never saw Foster raise his gun. The sergeant's defense attorneys argued Foster, who is white, did raise the rifle and that Perry had no choice but to shoot. Perry, who is also white, did not take the witness stand and jurors deliberated for two days before finding him guilty.Perry's attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The shooting set off fierce debate in 2020, amid the demonstrations sparked by a white Minneapolis police officer's killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man. Perry's conviction three years later prompted outrage from prominent conservatives.Before sentencing in the case, Carlson aired a broadcast calling the shooting an act of self-defense and criticizing Abbott for not coming on his show. The next day, Abbott said he believed Perry should not be punished and told Texas' parole board to expedite a review of the conviction.Abbott appoints the Board of Pardons and Paroles and state law requires that it recommend a pardon before he can act.After the verdict but before Perry was sentenced, the court unsealed dozens of pages of text messages and social media posts that showed he had hostile views toward Black Lives Matter protests. In a comment on Facebook a month before the shooting, Perry wrote, ""It is official I am a racist because I do not agree with people acting like animals at the zoo.""Perry served in the Army for more than a decade. At trial, a forensic psychologist testified that he believed Perry has post-traumatic stress disorder from his deployment to Afghanistan and from being bullied as a child. At the time of the shooting, Perry was stationed at Fort Cavazos, then Fort Hood, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) north of Austin.","Texas governor issues full pardon for former US Army sergeant convicted of murder.

The top UN court opens hearings on the Israeli military's incursion into Rafah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/the-top-un-court-opens-hearings-on-the-israeli-militarys-incursion-into-rafah/articleshow/110183957.cms,"THE HAGUE: The United Nations ' top court on Thursday opened two days of hearings into a request from South Africa to press Israel to halt its military operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah , where more than half of Gaza's population has sought shelter. It is the fourth time South Africa has asked the International Court of Justice for emergency measures since the nation launched proceedings alleging that Israel's military action in its war with Hamas in Gaza amounts to genocide .""The sitting is open,"" said ICJ President Nawaf Salam.According to the latest request, the previous preliminary orders by The Hague-based court were not sufficient to address ""a brutal military attack on the sole remaining refuge for the people of Gaza"".Israel has portrayed Rafah as the last stronghold of the militant group, brushing off warnings from the United States and other allies that any major operation there would be catastrophic for civilians.South Africa has asked the court to order Israel to withdraw from Rafah; to take measures to ensure unimpeded access for UN officials, humanitarian organisations and journalists to the Gaza Strip; and to report back within one week on how it is meeting these demands.During hearings earlier this year, Israel strongly denied committing genocide in Gaza and said it does all it can to spare civilians and is only targeting Hamas militants. It says Hamas' tactic of embedding in civilian areas makes it difficult to avoid civilian casualties.In January, judges ordered Israel to do all it can to prevent death, destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza, but the panel stopped short of ordering an end to the military offensive that has laid waste to the Palestinian enclave.In a second order in March, the court said Israel must take measures to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza, including opening more land crossings to allow food, water, fuel and other supplies to enter.Most of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people have been displaced since fighting began.The war began with a Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct 7 in which Palestinian militants killed around 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages. Gaza's Health Ministry says over 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, without distinguishing between civilians and combatants in its count.South Africa initiated proceedings in December 2023 and sees the legal campaign as rooted in issues central to its identity. Its governing party, the African National Congress, has long compared Israel's policies in Gaza and the occupied West Bank to its own history under the apartheid regime of white minority rule, which restricted most Blacks to ""homelands"". Apartheid ended in 1994.On Sunday, Egypt announced it plans to join the case. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Israeli military actions ""constitute a flagrant violation of international law, humanitarian law, and the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 regarding the protection of civilians during wartime"".Several countries have also indicated they plan to intervene, but so far only Libya, Nicaragua and Colombia have filed formal requests to do so.",The International Court of Justice has opened two days of hearings into a request from South Africa to press Israel to halt its military operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.

""This request, this effort to use contempt as a method of obtaining our sensitive law enforcement files is just most recent.""Garland said in his letter to Biden that lawmakers' efforts ""are plainly insufficient to outweigh the deleterious effects that the production of the recordings would have on the integrity and effectiveness of similar law enforcement investigations in the future.""The Justice Department also warned Congress that a contempt effort would create ""unnecessary and unwarranted conflict,"" with Assistant Attorney General Carlos Uriarte saying: ""It is the longstanding position of the executive branch held by administrations of both parties that an official who asserts the president's claim of executive privilege cannot be held in contempt of Congress.Siskel's letter to lawmakers comes after the uproar from Biden's aides and allies over special counsel Robert Hur's comments about Biden's age and mental acuity, and it highlights concerns in a difficult election year over how potentially embarrassing moments from the lengthy interview could be exacerbated by the release, or selective release, of the audio.The transcript of the Hur interview showed Biden struggling to recall some dates and occasionally confusing some details - something longtime aides says he's done for years in both public and private - but otherwise showing deep recall in other areas. Biden and his aides are particularly sensitive to questions about his age. At 81, he's the oldest ever president, and he's seeking another four-year term.Hur, a former senior official in the Trump administration Justice Department, was appointed as a special counsel in January 2023 following the discovery of classified documents in multiple locations tied to Biden.Hur's report said many of the documents recovered at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, in parts of Biden's Delaware home and in his Senate papers at the University of Delaware were retained by ""mistake.""But investigators did find evidence of willful retention and disclosure related a subset of records found in Biden's Wilmington, Delaware, house, including in a garage, an office and a basement den.The files pertain to a troop surge in Afghanistan during the Obama administration that Biden had vigorously opposed.

Some of that information was shared with a ghostwriter with whom he published memoirs in 2007 and 2017.","The White House has blocked the release of audio from President Joe Biden's interview with a special counsel about his handling of classified documents.

Europe on edge

In a disturbing incident that has sent shockwaves across Europe, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico was targeted in an assassination attempt that left him seriously injured. The event unfolded on a seemingly ordinary day in Handlova, Slovakia, when Fico was approached by a gunman as he was engaging with supporters. The assailant fired five times at close range, critically wounding the prime minister.The PM's bodyguards swiftly intervened, tackling the gunman and whisking Fico away in a government vehicle.He was subsequently airlifted to a hospital for emergency medical treatment.""I was very shocked ... fortunately as far as I know the operation went well - and I guess in the end he will survive ... he's not in a life-threatening situation at this moment,"" Slovak Deputy Prime Minister and Environment Minister Tomas Taraba told the BBC's Newshour.The attacker, identified as 71-year-old Slovak poet Juraj Cintula, was arrested at the scene. The motivations behind the attack appear to be politically charged, reflecting deep divisions within Slovakia and broader regional tensions. Cintula reportedly made a ""confession"" in custody, blaming Fico's media policies for his drastic actions.A seasoned figure in Slovakian politics, Fico was born in 1964 and began his political career as a member of the Communist Party before Slovakia became its independent nation. With a law degree and vast experience in legal and governmental roles, Fico has been a dominant force in Slovak politics.Fico's political journey is marked by significant milestones, including his first election to Slovakia's parliament in 1992 and his subsequent rise to become the chairman of the Smer (Direction) party in 1999. His tenure is characterized by a left-populist ideology, though comparisons have been drawn with right-wing leaders like Viktor Orbán of Hungary.After a hiatus, Fico reclaimed the prime ministerial position last year, marking his third term and establishing him as the longest-serving head of government in Slovakia's history. His recent electoral victory was fueled by a platform that controversially aligned more closely with pro-Russian stances and criticized US and Nato policies, especially regarding the situation in Ukraine.This assassination attempt occurs against a backdrop of heightened geopolitical tension. Fico, known for his pro-Putin stance, has been a controversial figure in European politics, especially regarding his opposition to supporting Ukraine against Russian aggressions.Starting his fourth term as prime minister, Fico administration stopped arms shipments to Ukraine, and critics are concerned that he might steer Slovakia — a Nato member with a population of 5.4 million — away from its pro-Western trajectory towards a path similar to that of Hungary under populist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.Russian President Vladimir Putin , who has shown support for Fico in the past, condemned the attack. Describing the shooting as a ""monstrous"" crime, Putin said in a telegram sent to Slovakia's President Zuzana Caputova: ""I know Robert Fico as a courageous and strong-minded man. I very much hope that these qualities will help him to survive this difficult situation.""The implications of this attack are far-reaching, raising concerns about the stability of not only Slovakia but the entire European region. Fico’s policies and his alignment with Russia have been divisive, and this incident may further inflame political tensions.World leaders, including US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , have condemned the attack. The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen emphasized that such acts of violence undermine democracy and have no place in society.Colonel Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commanding officer of UK's 1st Royal Tank Regiment, expressed his concerns to Daily Mail, saying, ""There are high stakes in Europe and the threat of a wider war only benefits Putin.""He further warned, ""This is yet another wake-up call to the West. If we ignore this latest threat to Western security the chances of getting drawn into a wider war in Europe are manifestly greater.""(With inputs from agencies)","Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico was targeted in an assassination attempt that left him seriously injured.

Xi Jinping is now Vladimir Putin's 'big brother': How Russia-China ties changed over the years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/xi-jinping-is-now-putins-big-brother-how-russia-china-ties-changed-over-the-years/articleshow/110162516.cms,"Driving the news

This is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election and the second in just over six months to China.

However, this is Putin's 19th visit to China since he became the Russian president.

In February 2022, China and Russia announced a ""no limits"" partnership during Putin's visit to Beijing, occurring just days before he deployed tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine, sparking the most severe land conflict in Europe since World War Two.

Putin's decision to choose China for his first overseas visit after being inaugurated for a new six-year term, extending his leadership until at least 2030, underscores the significance he places on his bond with Xi and his global strategic priorities.

In a discussion with China's Xinhua news agency, Putin commended Chinese President Xi Jinping for fostering a ""strategic partnership"" between Russia and China, which he described as rooted in national interests and profound mutual trust.

Zoom in

This visit is not just a routine diplomatic engagement but a strategic display of defiance against Western pressures.

The frequency and depth of military collaborations, such as joint naval drills near strategic global areas, signal a growing military camaraderie.

However, these maneuvers signal more about the depth of their partnership than actual operational military alliances. The joint naval patrols near American waters and the inclusion of Russia in Chinese-led military drills are significant developments that the West views with increasing concern.

Moreover, the economic interdependence, highlighted by China’s role as a critical supplier to Russia’s defense sector, showcases the depth of their bilateral ties, which are becoming increasingly consequential in the global arena.

Why it matters

The strengthening bond between China and Russia is pivotal as both nations seek to assert their power on the global stage against a backdrop of American dominance.

This alliance is particularly critical for Russia as it continues to face extensive economic sanctions from the West.

China’s support not only bolsters Russia’s economy but also enhances its military capabilities through joint exercises and technology transfers.

As per a report in the Economist, the flow of Chinese technology and other valuable goods to Russian weapons manufacturers has become a significant concern for the United States. According to US secretary of state Antony Blinken China was the ""top supplier"" of various items considered be ""dual use,"" including machine tools, microelectronics, and nitrocellulose, a vital component in artillery shells. These items have both civilian and military applications.

""Russia would struggle to sustain its assault on Ukraine without China's support,"" Blinken said. In a later conversation with Borge Brende, the president of the World Economic Forum, Blinken said that over the past year, Chinese technology had been facilitating Russia's production of weapons and ammunition, such as missiles and tanks, at an unprecedented rate in its modern history, surpassing even the levels seen during the Cold War era, the Economist report added.

What they are saying

""It was the unprecedentedly high level of the strategic partnership between our countries that determined my choice of China as the first state that I would visit after officially taking office as president of the Russian Federation,"" Putin said.

""We will try to establish closer cooperation in the field of industry and high technology, space and peaceful nuclear energy, artificial intelligence, renewable energy sources and other innovative sectors,"" Putin said.

""This is Putin's first trip after his inauguration, and it is therefore intended to show that Sino-Russian relations are moving up another level,"" independent Russian political analyst Konstantin Kalachev told AFP.

""The China-Russia relationship today is hard-earned, and the two sides need to cherish and nurture it,"" Xi told Putin.

""China is willing to ... jointly achieve the development and rejuvenation of our respective countries, and work together to uphold fairness and justice in the world,"" said Xi.

""The United States still thinks in terms of the Cold War and is guided by the logic of bloc confrontation, putting the security of 'narrow groups' above regional security and stability, which creates a security threat for all countries in the region,"" the joint statement said. ""The US must abandon this behaviour.""

The 'big brother' role reversal

The relationship between Russia and China has undergone a significant transformation in recent years, with Moscow becoming increasingly dependent on Beijing as it faces Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine.

Once a partnership of equals, the Russia-China dynamic has become increasingly asymmetrical, with China holding the upper hand. While China accounts for around 33% of Russia's overall trade, Russia makes up only 4% of China's trade, according to data provider CEIC Data.

China has emerged as a critical source of essential goods for Russia, supplying everything from electronics to washing machines to tractors.

However, Russia's arms exports to China have fallen precipitously in recent years, while China has become a significant provider of optics, microelectronics, drone engines, and other materials that enable Russia's weapons production. The energy trade between the two countries has also shifted in China's favor.

""It's a strategic partnership where both sides need each other but it's increasingly asymmetrical in China's favor,"" Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin, told the Wall Street Journal. ""China is not only the more powerful partner, but also the one that has many more options than Russia and the war has exacerbated that.""

Russia, with its oil and gas now shunned in Europe, has had to sell at significant discounts to China.

China’s upper hand is evident in negotiations over new projects like the Power-of-Siberia 2 gas pipeline, where Beijing's reluctance to finalize terms highlights its leverage over Moscow.

Putin, who is sometimes known for his haughty displays of making other leaders wait during their visits to the Kremlin, has adopted a noticeably deferential tone towards Xi Jinping, a LA Times report said.

No wonder, an Economist report described the visit as ""Vladimir Putin will meet his big brother in Beijing.""

What next

China, once the junior partner of Moscow in the global Communist hierarchy, has emerged as by far the most powerful of Russia's friends in the world.

Consequently, in the evolving personal relationship between the two ""presidents for life"", Xi has emerged as the ""big brother"" to Putin.

At the same time, the strengthening ties between China and Russia represent a significant shift in global alliances and power structures. The implications of their collaboration will undoubtedly extend far beyond their own borders, challenging the current international order and testing the diplomatic resilience of the Western powers.

NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Beijing on Thursday for a two-day state visit to China, underscoring the solidarity between the two allies as Russia continues its new offensive in Ukraine.Upon his arrival at dawn, Putin was greeted by an honor guard from the People's Liberation Army, the military branch of China's ruling Communist Party.His motorcade, flanked by a brigade of military police on motorcycles, proceeded into the city.

Robert Fico: All you need to know about Slovak PM targeted in assassination attempt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/who-is-robert-fico-all-you-need-to-know-about-slovak-pm-targeted-in-assassination-attempt/articleshow/110162816.cms,"Who is Robert Fico?

Fico, who is serving as a premier for the third time, along with his leftist party Direction – Social Democracy (Smer), emerged victorious in Slovakia’s parliamentary elections held on September 30, 2023. This victory marked a political resurgence for him, as he campaigned on a platform supporting Russia and opposing America.

Critics were concerned that under Fico, Slovakia might deviate from its pro-Western path and align with the direction taken by Hungary under the populist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

The victory in 2023 signifies Fico serving his fourth term as the prime minister, after previously occupying the position from 2006 to 2010, from 2012 to 2018, and once more from 2023. Fico's political career is remarkable due to his achievement as the prime minister with the longest tenure in Slovakia's history, spanning more than ten years.

Rise to political prominence

In 1992, Fico started his political career by winning a seat in the Slovak Parliament when Czechoslovakia was still united.

In his early career, he was appointed to the Council of Europe, where he acquired valuable political experience. In 1999, Fico established the Direction – Social Democracy (Smer) party, a political movement that he has been leading since it started.

Fico rose to power after his party won the 2006 parliamentary election, resulting in the establishment of his initial cabinet. His political position is commonly characterized as populist, attracting a wide range of voters through a combination of social welfare policies and nationalistic language.

After the 2010 parliamentary election, Fico moved into a position as a member of parliament in the opposition, ultimately becoming the leader of the opposition. His political strength was shown in 2012 when a vote of no confidence in the Iveta Radičová cabinet resulted in early elections. Fico's Smer party achieved a significant win, obtaining 83 seats and establishing a government with an overwhelming majority, the first of its kind in Slovakia since the end of communism in 1989.

In 2013, Fico announced that he was running for the 2014 presidential election. However, he lost to his political rival Andrej Kiska in the second round of voting. Despite this defeat, Fico continued to be an important figure in Slovak politics.

Fico's third term as prime minister ended suddenly in March 2018 during a political crisis that occurred after the murder of investigative journalist Ján Kuciak. This crisis resulted in extensive protests and demands for government accountability. As a response, Fico stepped down, and Deputy PM Peter Pellegrini took over.

The parliamentary election of 2023 signified the comeback of Fico to a position of authority. His campaign centered on ending military assistance to Ukraine during the Russian invasion, a position that struck a chord with a large segment of the voters. Smer emerged victorious in the election, securing the highest number of votes at 22.95% and 42 seats.

Fico established a coalition government with Voice – Social Democracy (Hlas) and the Slovak National Party, commencing his fourth tenure as prime minister on October 25, 2023.

In his current term, the government led by Fico has adopted a controversial position on global matters, particularly by declining to participate in a coalition led by the Czech Republic consisting of approximately 20 countries to offer military assistance to Ukraine.

NEW DELHI: The Slovakian Prime Minister, Robert Fico , was shot multiple times during a political event on Wednesday, marking the first assassination attempt on a European leader since 2003, and adding to the history of violence in his long political career.However, “he’s not in a life threatening situation at this moment, ” his deputy prime minister Tomas Taraba was quoted as saying by the BBC.The incident also occurs just three weeks before the crucial European Parliament elections. It is expected that populist and hard-right parties in the 27-nation bloc will make significant gains.","Robert Fico, who is serving as a premier for the third time, along with his leftist party Direction – Social Democracy (Smer), emerged victorious in Slovakia’s parliamentary elections held on September 30, 2023.

NEW DELHI: Russia launched a satellite, Cosmos-2553 , into space on February 5, 2022, which US officials say is designed to test components for a potential anti-satellite weapon that could carry a nuclear device.Although the satellite does not carry a nuclear weapon, it is linked to a growing concern within the Biden administration , Congress, and experts about Russia's nuclear anti-satellite program, a Wall Street Journal report said.Russia claims that the Cosmos-2553 spacecraft is intended for scientific research, a claim that US officials say isn't plausible.The satellite was launched 19 days before President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022.Russia's ministry of defense said that the spacecraft was ""equipped with newly developed onboard instruments and systems for testing them under conditions of exposure to radiation and heavy charged particles.""However, assistant secretary of state Mallory Stewart challenged this explanation, saying that the satellite's orbit is in a region not used by any other spacecraft and has a higher radiation environment than normal lower Earth orbits, but not high enough to allow accelerated testing of electronics as Russia has described.As per the WSJ report, the US has been aware of Russia's interest in a nuclear anti-satellite capability for years, but it has only recently been able to better determine the program's progress.The US efforts to discuss its concerns about the anti-satellite program directly with Russian officials have been rebuffed, officials said.Concerns over Russia's nuclear antisatellite capabilities have led to heightened tension in Washington.In February, Rep Mike Turner highlighted a ""serious national-security threat"" linked to this issue, urging President Biden to declassify relevant information.The US and Japan attempted to address the situation by proposing a UN resolution affirming the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, but Russia vetoed it, arguing the resolution didn't go far enough to ban all types of space weapons.As per a Foreign Policy report, the United States, along with its allies, relies extensively on a network of space-based command and control satellites that are pivotal for crucial military communications, intelligence gathering, and targeting capabilities.These satellites are especially vital in a scenario where conventional warfare could escalate to nuclear conflict, ensuring that the White House and the defense department can monitor the status and security of the United States’ 5,244 nuclear warheads. Recognizing this critical role, the Pentagon plans to invest $8 billion to reinforce these systems.However, the threat extends beyond military concerns. Commercial satellites, which are integral to global communications and economic systems, would also be at risk. The consequences of a nuclear detonation in space would be far-reaching, affecting life on Earth in significant ways.If deployed, this weapon would enable Moscow to destroy hundreds of satellites in low Earth orbit with a nuclear blast. The aftermath could disrupt or completely dismantle the global economic and communication frameworks for years, rendering certain orbits hazardous or even unusable due to accumulating space debris.In practical terms, this could mean losing the internet connection you currently rely on and the functionality of the smartphone you are using right now, the Foreign Policy report said.Russia claims the satellite is intended for scientific research, but US officials dispute this. Assistant secretary of state Mallory Stewart remarked that the orbit of Cosmos-2553 is unusual and not used by other spacecraft, suggesting the satellite's true purpose is related to Russia's antisatellite ambitions.“The orbit is in a region not used by any other spacecraft—that in itself was somewhat unusual,” she said.The US continues to monitor and assess Russia’s space activities.Efforts to engage Russian officials directly on this issue have been unsuccessful.As per the Foreign Policy report, the Biden administration reportedly contacted both China and India, urging them to leverage their influence to persuade Moscow against deploying a space weapon .As Cosmos-2553 remains in orbit, the international community remains vigilant about the potential escalation of space weaponization .","Russia launched a satellite, Cosmos-2553, into space on February 5, 2022.

They manipulated the Ethereum network's transaction ordering by setting up validators that deceived other traders' bots, enabling them to siphon off $25 million rapidly.The stolen funds were then laundered through a series of complex transactions designed to obscure the origins of the money. The brothers also established shell companies and deliberately targeted cryptocurrency exchanges with lax customer verification processes to facilitate their laundering efforts.This arrest is part of a broader US Justice Department initiative aimed at curbing fraud and misconduct within the cryptocurrency industry. This case follows other notable convictions, including that of Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX, another MIT alumnus.As the legal proceedings unfold, the Peraire-Bueno brothers have yet to respond through their legal representatives.

In an interview with CNN, Blade indicated that the couple might leave the country if Trump is acquitted in the landmark New York v.Trump case, which focuses on accusations of falsified business records linked to a payment made to Daniels.Blade detailed the emotional and practical implications of the trial's potential outcomes, expressing a bleak outlook: ""If Trump is found not guilty… I don’t think it gets better for her, you know? I think if it’s not guilty, we got to decide what to do. Good chance we’ll probably vacate this country."" He further explained that an acquittal or a conviction would still leave them facing significant public scrutiny and hostility, particularly from Trump's supporters who might blame Daniels for the former president's legal troubles.Daniels herself has been at the center of this legal storm, having testified about her alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump at a hotel in Lake Tahoe. Her testimony, described as both detailed and delivered with a mixture of seriousness and humor, has been a focal point of media coverage. The presiding judge even had to remind Daniels to keep her responses concise and relevant, highlighting the intense scrutiny and the charged atmosphere of the proceedings.The possibility of leaving the US reflects a broader narrative familiar among celebrities who have publicly considered emigration in response to political developments, a sentiment echoed during Trump’s rise to and tenure in power. Notably, other public figures have made similar declarations without following through, adding a layer of celebrity-driven spectacle to political discourse.As the trial continues, the outcome will not only affect legal precedents but also deeply personal decisions for those like Daniels and Blade, who find their lives inextricably linked to the turbulent dynamics of US politics.","Adult film star Stormy Daniels and her husband, Barrett Blade, have voiced concerns about their future in the United States.

"North Carolina lawmakers push bill to ban most public mask wearing, citing crime",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/north-carolina-lawmakers-push-bill-to-ban-most-public-mask-wearing-citing-crime/articleshow/110169044.cms,"RALEIGH: Republican lawmakers in North Carolina are pushing forward with their plan to repeal a pandemic-era law that allowed the wearing of masks in public for health reasons, a move spurred in part by demonstrations against the war in Gaza that have included masked protesters camped out on college campuses.The legislation cleared the Senate on Wednesday in a 30-15 vote along party lines despite several attempts by state Senate Democrats to change the bill.The bill, which would raise penalties for someone who wears a mask while committing a crime, including arrested protesters, could still be altered as it heads back to the House.Opponents of the bill say it risks the health of those masking for safety reasons. But those backing the legislation say it is a needed response to the demonstrations, including those at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill that escalated to police clashes and arrests. The bill also further criminalizes the blockage of roads or emergency vehicles for a protest, which has occurred during pro-Palestinian demonstrations in Raleigh and Durham.""It's about time that the craziness is put, at least slowed down, if not put to a stop,"" Wilson County Republican Sen Buck Newton, who presented the bill, said on the Senate floor Wednesday.Most of the pushback against the bill has centered around its removal of health and safety exemptions for wearing a mask in public. The health exemption was added at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic along largely bipartisan lines.This strikethrough would return public masking rules to their pre-pandemic form, which were created in 1953 to address a different issue: limiting Ku Klux Klan activity in North Carolina, according to a 2012 book by Washington University in St Louis sociology professor David Cunningham.Since the pandemic, masks have become a partisan flashpoint - and Senate debate on if the law would make it illegal to mask for health purposes was no different.Democratic lawmakers repeated their unease about how removing protections for people who choose to mask for their health could put immunocompromised North Carolinians at risk of breaking the law. Legislative staff said during a Tuesday committee that masking for health purposes would violate the law.""You're making careful people into criminals with this bill,"" Democratic Sen. Natasha Marcus of Mecklenburg County said on the Senate floor. ""It's a bad law.""Simone Hetherington, an immunocompromised person who spoke during Wednesday's Senate Rules Committee, said masking is one of the only ways she can protect herself from illnesses and fears the law would prevent that practice.""We live in different times and I do receive harassment,"" Hetherington said about her mask wearing. ""It only takes one bad actor.""But Republican legislators continued to express doubt that someone would get in legal trouble for masking because of health concerns, saying law enforcement and prosecutors would use discretion on whether to charge someone. Newton said the bill focuses on criminalizing masks only for the purpose of concealing one's identity.""I smell politics on the other side of the aisle when they're scaring people to death about a bill that is only going to criminalize people who are trying to hide their identity so they can do something wrong,"" Newton said.Three Senate Democrats proposed amendments to keep the health exemption and exclude hate groups from masking, but Senate Republicans used a procedural mechanism to block them without going up for a vote.Future changes to the bill could be a possibility, but it would ultimately be up to the House, Newton told reporters after the vote. Robeson County Republican Sen. Danny Britt also said during an earlier committee that he anticipated ""some tweaking.""House Rules Committee Chairman Destin Hall, a Caldwell County House Republican, told reporters before the Senate vote that the House planned to ""take a look at it"" but members wanted to clamp down on people who wear masks while committing crimes.The masking bill will likely move through a few committees before hitting the House floor, which could take one or two weeks, Hall said.","North Carolina Senate votes 30-15 to repeal a law that allowed the wearing of masks in public for health reasons.

California University hit with backlash over Israel boycott,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-university-hit-with-backlash-over-israel-boycott/articleshow/110168823.cms,"The president of Sonoma State University , a public liberal arts college in California, was placed on leave a day after he announced a controversial agreement with pro-Palestinian protesters that includes an academic boycott of Israel and a role for student activists to enforce the deal.“In my attempt to find agreement with one group of students, I marginalized other members of our student population and community,” Sonoma State President Mike Lee wrote in a note to the campus.“I realize the harm that this has caused, and I take full ownership of it. I deeply regret the unintended consequences of my actions.”The agreement, which was announced late Tuesday by Lee and campus activists, stipulates the institution will not pursue formal academic collaborations with Israeli institutions, including study abroad programs. Lee also had said the school would commit to creating a divestment strategy that “includes ethical alternatives,” but stopped short of agreeing to divest Israel-linked entities from the university’s endowment.“None of us should be on the sidelines when human beings are subject to mass killing and destruction,” Lee said in his first message to the campus community.Lee acknowledged that he drafted and sent the message without getting approval from California State University Chancellor Mildred García and other system leaders. She described his actions as “insubordination.”“I want to acknowledge how deeply concerned I am about the impact the statement has had on the Sonoma State community, and how challenging and painful it will be for many of our students and community members to see and read,” Garcia said in a statement.Sonoma State, which is located in Rohnert Park near the vineyards of Napa Valley, is one of the smaller institutions within the 23-campus California State University network , which is the largest four-year public university system in the US.Universities across the US have been dealing with dealing with protests and campus tensions since October, when Hamas, designated a terrorist organization by the US and European Union, attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people, taking hundreds hostages and sparking a retaliatory war in Gaza. More than 35,000 people have since been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.At UC Irvine on Wednesday, police were sent in after protesters occupied the Physical Sciences Lecture Hall near a tent encampment, the Los Angeles Times reported.While universities such as Harvard, Rutgers and Northwestern have engaged with activists in order to end tent encampments and disruptions, they’ve rejected demands to divest from Israeli assets or defense stocks, citing the complexity of investment structures, potential legal issues and a refusal to politicize the endowments.State Senator Scott Wiener, an outspoken critic of campus protests, said in a social media post on Wednesday that the Sonoma State agreement “aligned the campus with BDS” — referring to the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement against Israel.The effort has long been criticized as antisemitic because it calls into question the legitimacy of the Jewish state and singles out one country for its policies. Advocates have argued that boycotts and divestments represent one of the few non-violent tactics to pressure Israel.A particularly contentious part of the Sonoma State agreement designates Students for Justice in Palestine, a campus group, as the sole authority to appoint members to a new advisory group tasked with overseeing the agreement’s implementation along with administration staff.On Tuesday night, the Sonoma State chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine took to Instagram to declare that its demands were met.",Sonoma State President Mike Lee is on leave after announcing an agreement with pro-Palestinian protesters.

Many also want their universities to end academic relationships with Israeli institutions.“It's important that the Biden administration understands and hears us and does something about it by not continuing to oppress us, but also just actually understanding what we want,” said Shreya Srivastava, a highschooler from Baltimore.“I think the more that you oppress the students, the more that you push back, the more that we will also push back. So, all these law enforcements that are happening, the more that universities try to sway away from the current situation, it just ignites more passion in us,” she told PTI asserting that none of the two presidential candidates represents the views and sentiments of the youth.Aara and Shreya were part of a panel discussion on “Youth Who Impact” organised by the Indian American Impact, a Democratic think-tank here, during its annual summit, which among others was addressed by Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris faced protest during her address on Wednesday evening.Both Aara and Shreya said that the current Biden administration does not understand the sentiments and voices of the youth of the country on the war in Gaza and asserted that the protests in college campuses across the country indicate that the mood of the nation is moving away from supporting Israel.""We don't want you to support Israel. But they're not listening to us. What the Biden administration needs to do is definitely start listening to the students. Because even though we're students, that does not mean we do not understand. I think honestly, at times we sometimes understand more because we look in. When we're passionate about something, we are committed to learning everything and anything about a certain topic. Once we know everything, then only do we speak out,” she said.Aara said that President Joe Biden's stance on this issue would impact the voting pattern among the youth.“We will keep pushing until we are heard until more of these conversations are being had. With the upcoming election, Biden's stance on the issue is going to affect the young voter population,” she said.","Two Indian-American students have come out in support of the ongoing protests on college campuses across the US over demand to divest from Israel.

Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan gets bail in graft case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-khan-pakistan-bail-graft-case-land-corruption-case-islamabad-court/articleshow/110151891.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan 's former prime minister Imran Khan was granted bail by Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday in a land corruption case.The ex-cricketer faced charges of receiving land from a real estate developer while serving as prime minister, allegedly in exchange for unlawful favors.A day prior, a two-member bench, consisting of IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, had reserved the verdict after concluding arguments from the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) prosecution team and Sardar Latif Khan Khosa, Imran's counsel, Dawn reported.Today, the court announced Imran's bail at Rs 1 million. However, he remains incarcerated as he is serving sentences in the cipher and iddat cases. Notably, his sentences in two distinct Toshakhana cases were suspended by the IHC.During Tuesday's court session, NAB Special Prosecutor Amjad Pervaiz had indicated that the trial of the former premier and his spouse was nearing completion in his closing remarks.Last December, the National Accountability Bureau launched an inquiry against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Khan, his wife Bushra Bibi, and others, regarding the alleged acquisition of numerous acres of land under the guise of Al Qadir University Trust. This purportedly resulted in a reported loss of 190 million pounds to the national treasury.In a bail petition filed in November of the same year, Khan asserted that the NAB, allegedly acting as a tool of the previous Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government, was politically targeting him through this case, as per Dawn.The Al-Qadir Trust matter revolves around the settlement of 190 million pounds (approximately Rs 50 billion), transferred to Pakistan by the UK's National Crime Agency following its recovery from a Pakistani real estate magnate. During his tenure as prime minister, Khan opted to allow the businessman to utilize the funds to partially settle a fine of around Rs 450 billion, previously imposed by the Supreme Court, instead of depositing it into the national treasury.","Imran Khan was granted bail by Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday in a land corruption case.
