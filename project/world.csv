We wanted to introduce the governor in our Constitution because we thought that an element of harmony would be there and that institution would bring about some sort of understanding and harmony between the conflicting groups of people if really the governor is conscious of his duties and functions well. It is only for this purpose this is proposed, the governing idea is to place the governor above party politics, above factions and not to subject him to party affairs,"" Justice Nagarathna quoted Deshmukh.""In today's times, unfortunately, some governors in India are playing a role where they ought not to and are inactive where they ought to be,"" Justice Nagarathna remarked.Justice Nagarathna underscored the need to emphasise federalism , fraternity , fundamental rights, and principled governance.

She reached the area around 5am, only to find the neighbourhood she knew reduced to heaps of mud and slush.Vijayakumari immediately offered to join the rescue effort, telling officials that she was a trained civil defence volunteer. By 8pm, she had helped retrieve 17 bodies.""It was an unsettling sight, but one that I couldn't turn my back on,"" she told TOI.Over the next two days, Vijayakumari worked tirelessly in the temporary morgue set up at Meppadi to keep bodies and body parts brought from Nilambur.

KOLKATA: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Sunday dialled her Jharkhand counterpart Hemant Soren , urging him to check the ""sudden and huge release of water"" from Tenughat dam on Damodar river in Bokaro which is affecting her state. Banerjee said she had also told Soren that ""Jharkhand waters have been flooding Bengal, and this was man-made"".Banerjee posted on X: ""I have...been monitoring the situation and have spoken to all the DMs concerned in south Bengal as well as in north Bengal. I have asked the DMs to be particularly vigilant and take proper care of the calamity situation in the next 3/4 days.

""Less water is expected to be discharged from Tenughat now since rainfall has reduced.

Bengal prisons minister Akhil Giri resigns from state cabinet amid controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/west-bengal-mantri-calls-official-beast-quits-after-furore/articleshow/112270797.cms,"CONTAI (EAST MIDNAPORE): Bengal prisons minister Akhil Giri, under pressure from both within Trinamool Congress and outside for his vituperative outburst against state forest ranger Manisha Shaw on Saturday, on Sunday said he had resigned from the state cabinet.But he remained adamant against apologising to Shaw. Claiming to be ""repentant"" of his comments, he said in the same breath that there was ""no question"" of him apologising to ""a state officer"".On Saturday, Giri launched a volley of verbal abuse on Shaw, calling her ""beyadob (discourteous)"" and a ""janowar (beast)"".He also told the officer how to behave, screaming at her, ""A state employee should talk with his/her heads bowed down."" Shaw, 36, had earned the minister's wrath for refuting local allegations of high-handed behaviour after an anti-encroachment drive on forest land on the Tajpur coastline.Giri is no stranger to such controversy . In Nov 2022, he had earned the party's wrath and censure for objectionable comments against President Droupadi Murmu, with Trinamool chief and CM Mamata Banerjee even publicly apologising on his behalf. The party had also warned him against making such comments.On Saturday, Trinamool state president Subrata Bakshi called up Giri and told him that he had to either resign from the cabinet or face expulsion. Bakshi also made it clear that Banerjee was angry and pained at the manner in which he had abused and threatened Shaw. Senior party functionary Kunal Ghosh also said that Trinamool had not taken kindly to Giri's outburst, admonishing him and asking him to apologise to the officer.The Forest Rangers' Association (West Bengal) wrote to Banerjee, seeking action against Giri for ""intimidating a colleague"" on duty. Members of the association also observed an hour-long protest by attending office wearing black badges. Sensing the mood, forest minister Birbaha Hansda called up Shaw and spoke to her. Shaw herself has refused to speak to the media.On Sunday morning, Giri hastily convened a press meet, where he told reporters he ""repents"" his action. ""I should not have said that, but I cannot take back what I said. The forest officer's misbehaviour with the locals infuriated me,"" he said. But he added he would not call her to apologise. ""I have never apologised to a state officer, and I never will,"" he said.Bengal prisons minister Akhil Giri, who resigned from state cabinet on Sunday, even acknowledged that ""CM Mamata Banerjee is very pained"" at his unseemly outburst against forest ranger Manisha Shaw.""Perhaps that is why she has taken this decision,"" he said. ""But I will go to no one to plead (for myself). I have never done it in the past. I will email by resignation (from the cabinet) today. A hard copy will be sent on Monday,"" he added.Banerjee is scheduled to chair a cabinet meeting on Monday.Giri said he had been an MLA multiple times and became a cabinet minister in 2022. ""I will continue to work for the people,"" he said. Asked why he was siding with illegal encroachers, staking his own political career, he said: ""They are not encroachers. In the incessant rain, they are people who have lost their livelihood and homes. That was a vacant piece of land, where they took shelter. Can we stop being humane? I cannot.""","Prisons minister Akhil Giri resigned from state cabinet on Sunday. But he remained adamant against apologising to state forest ranger Manisha Shaw.

Kerala landslides: Punchirimattom has lost its smile,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/kerala-landslides-punchirimattom-has-lost-its-smile/articleshow/112237239.cms,"Kallingal Unnikrishnan (Left), Abdul Latheef Kurikkal(Right)

MEPPADI (WAYANAD) : Punchirimattom , a picturesque hamlet in the valley beneath the towering Mundakkai hills was the first to be hit by the huge landslide , suffering the worst impact.As the name suggests, ‘punchiri’ (smile) in its name refers to the striking scenic beauty of the area due to the tall hills blanketed with forests and cardamom plantations.But the smile has waned as survivors even dread at the thought of returning.Punchirimattom, which had nearly 60 houses, was flattened in a matter of seconds as the landslide obliterated everything in its path. Mundakkai, which is 2km downstream, at least has rubbles and wreckage of a few buildings.Kallingal Unnikrishnan is a lucky survivor, whose house was among the first at Punchirimattom to be flattened, now dreads even to step foot on his native land. Unnikrishnan, a daily wage earner, lost his wife who had gone to her sister’s house at Chooralmala.“I didn’t want to come here but did so today after my friends insisted. This was the land which we all loved so much and I had toiled for years to build our dream house. But after the trauma that left so much devastation , it is haunting to be back here. I was inside the house when the landslide struck at around 1.30am. It was like a helicopter flying close. Half of my house crumbled down and I ran up to the second floor and stood there witnessing the horror of debris flowravaging everything around, including my neighbour’s house,” said Unnikrishnan. When I called my wife’s relative, she said that my wife Shyja, her sister, sisterin-law and brother-in-law were missing, he added.Abdul Latheef Kurikkal, who was working in the Gulf, reached Puthirimattom on hearing of the landslide having swept away his house. But his family members managed to survive. “Our house stood just 50m away from the river and, it is just a flat ground. Same is the case with my daughter’s house and of my brothers. Luckily my family members managed to save their lives as they had moved to houses of relatives on Monday,” he said.Kurikkal said they were proud of their land, which was an idyllic haven with several tourist spots like Seethamma Kund and a small waterbody where tourists frequented. However, those areas have now become blank spaces.Over 100 connections at Punchirimattom have been lost and KSEB connections cannot be restored as the topography of the entire area has been transformed, said overseer Abdul Saleem Manjileri.","Punchirimattom, a picturesque hamlet in the valley beneath the towering Mundakkai hills, was the first to be hit by the huge landslide.

The New York Post reported that when Ella was having lunch with a friend inside the restaurant, a New Yorker confronted her security personnel outside without realizing that he was a part of the Secret Service.The report said that the agitator ripped a license plate off the black SUVs parked on the street during the argument following which the NYPD was called to the scene. Ella Emhoff was rushed out and placed in one of the SUVs and whisked away. The man was arrested and two low-level charges were pressed against him, the report said. There was no danger to anyone, Secret Service confirmed to NYP.The agitator was apparently complaining about the NYPD parking passes used by the Secret Service to allow them to park on busy streets.Ella Emhoff is a 25-year-old model who came to news recently after she shielded her 'momala' Kamala Harris from ""childless"" jibe and made it known to the world that Kamala Harris can't be called childless when she is the stepmother of her and Cole. Ella was also noticed for her initiative in raising fund for Gaza. Though her father Douglas Emhoff is a Jewish, Ella was not raised as a Jew and she does not identify with the religion, it was confirmed by her spokesperson who said that it was primarily because she did not grow up with Judaism.“It’s not surprising that Ella is engaging in her step-mom’s race for president. She is pro-Hamas just like Kamala,” GOP strategist Garrett Ventry said when Ella came out in support of Kamala Harris.The US Secret Service issued a statement after the restaurant incident and said Secret Service Agents quickly detained the individual who damaged license plates probably knowing that they were related to Secret Service.

Donald Trump's running mate JD Vance in a podcast spoke how he was chosen as the VP pick by the GOP after 18 months of being a Senator and said that during the vetting process, he was asked by a lawyer whether he had a secret family -- another spouse apart from Usha Chilukuri Vance. JD said his wife was sitting there and three children were sleeping upstairs when the lawyer said he had to ask an intrusive question.""I was like, 'Are you serious?' Do I have a secret family? Like, what do you mean? He said sometimes you know people have another spouse, other kids in a place like Alaska,"" Vance said.""Oh by the way, if I did I am not gonna admit it in front of my wife. It's one of those questions where if you got to that point in your life that you are such a dishonest person and have a secret family in Alaska, I think they would hide it. But no, I don't have a secret family in Alaska,"" Vance said laughing adding that they ask all these weird questions to prepare for the media firestorm.JD detailed how he got to know that he has been named as VP pick by Trump. Because of the ongoing vetting process, he knew he was one of the candidates Trump was shortlisting but the moment it was decided, he was on a plane to Milwaukee without Wi-Fi and on landing, he saw 350 messages.At the hotel room, when he finally got the opportunity to speak to Trump, Trump said, ""JD, you missed a very important phone call and now I'm gonna have to pick somebody else."" JD said his son at that time was talking continuously about Pikachu. ""I told him, son shut hell up for 30 seconds... I have the most important phone call of my life..."" Vance said adding that Trump overheard the conversation and asked him to put the phone of the speaker so that his son could hear the news. ""Trump read the statement and asked my son, 'What do you think about that?' and he said it's pretty cool...and then my whole life changed,"" JD said.JD is married to Indian-origin lawyer Usha Vance. They met at Yale Law school. The couple have three children. On Usha, JD said she doesn't like politics and doesn't seek spotlight but people have been so supportive of the entire thing that she's also into it now.","Donald Trump's running mate JD Vance in a podcast spoke how he was chosen as the VP pick by the GOP.

What is behind violent protests that have erupted in Bangladesh?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/what-is-behind-violent-protests-that-have-erupted-in-bangladesh/articleshow/112268065.cms,"What triggered the protest?

What govt has to say

Violence marred Bangladesh after days of peace as anti-government protestors on Sunday again hit the streets demanding PM Sheikh Hasina's resignation.Demonstrators resumed their protest in huge numbers as part of their non-cooperation plan aimed at unsettling the government.Vast crowds of protesters, many wielding sticks, packed into Dhaka 's central Shahbagh Square on Sunday, with street battles in multiple sites as well as in other key cities, police told news agency AFP.Later, the protest turned violent as demonstrators clashed with the government supporters who also took to the streets on Sunday.Police fired tear gas and lobbed stun grenades to disperse tens of thousands of protesters.In the wake of the sudden surge in clashes, the interior ministry declared an indefinite nationwide curfew starting at 6 pm (1200 GMT).However, sustained crackles of gunfire after dark were heard on Sunday, with protesters defying a nationwide curfew, according to AFP.At least 91 people, including 14 policemen, have been killed and hundreds injured in fierce clashes, forcing authorities to cut off mobile internet and enforce a nationwide curfew for an indefinite period.The protests began last month following a High Court order to restore 30 per cent job quotas for descendants of freedom fighters.Nearly 32 million young people are out of work or education in Bangladesh with a population of 170 million. The students called for striking down a 30 per cent reservation quota for the families of freedom fighters.Hasina's refusal to meet the students' demands, citing the ongoing court proceedings, escalated the situation.Her comments, labelling those opposing the job quotas as 'Razakars', who collaborated with the Pakistani army during the 1971 War of Independence, prompted thousands of students to leave their dormitories at Dhaka University to protest last month.Hasina's remark further fuelled the tension which turned into deadly and widespread civil unrest across the nation, claiming over 120 lives.Later, Bangladesh's top court scaled back the controversial quota system for civil service job applicants, reducing its scope but stopping short of complete abolition.PM Sheikh Hasina said those protesting were not students but terrorists and urged people to ""suppress them with a firm hand"".Those engaging in sabotage in the name of protest across the country are not students but terrorists, she said, according to Prothom Alo newspaper.Hasina called a meeting of the National Committee on Security Affairs at Ganabhaban, the newspaper reported citing sources from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO).""I appeal to the countrymen to suppress these terrorists with a firm hand,"" she said. The meeting was attended by the chiefs of the Army, Navy, Air Force, police, RAB, BGB, and other top security officers.",Violence marred Bangladesh after days of peace as anti-government protestors on Sunday again hit the streets demanding PM Sheikh Hasina's resignation.

Nationwide unrest

Far-right agitation and online mobilization

Legal and social consequences

A mob of masked rioters, reportedly led by far-right agitators , attempted to set fire to a hotel housing asylum seekers as anti-immigration protests erupted in violence across the country.Approximately 700 people gathered outside the Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham on Sunday, where tensions quickly escalated. Protesters clashed with police, hurling wood, bottles, and chairs, and spraying fire extinguishers at officers.South Yorkshire Police confirmed that at least ten officers were injured, including one who was left unconscious with a head injury.Footage from the scene showed a large bin on fire near the hotel, as protesters chanted, “Get them out,” draped in St George and Union flags. Reports indicate that some rioters stormed the hotel, with fire being set inside and asylum seekers seen peering out of windows in fear.UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the attack, describing it as ""far-right thuggery"" and vowing that the perpetrators would face swift justice. ""This is not a protest, it is organized, violent thuggery and it has no place on our streets or online,"" Starmer said in a statement from 10 Downing Street.“Be in no doubt: Those who have participated in this violence will face the full force of the law,” Starmer said, noting that the police would be making arrests and that charges would follow. “I guarantee you will regret taking part in this disorder, whether directly or those whipping up this action online and then running away themselves. This is not protest. It is organized, violent thuggery.”The violence in Rotherham is part of a broader wave of unrest that has spread across the country, following a deadly stabbing rampage at a dance class that left three girls dead. The far-right has seized on the incident, using it to stoke anti-immigration sentiments and organize violent demonstrations.In the northeastern town of Middlesbrough, tensions flared as protesters broke through police lines, vandalizing homes and cars, and attacking officers with bricks and cans. Similar scenes were reported across other towns, where far-right protesters have targeted minority communities and law enforcement.Assistant Chief Constable Lindsey Butterfield of South Yorkshire Police condemned the rioters' actions, emphasizing that even those who did not participate in the violence were complicit by standing by. ""We have officers working hard, reviewing the considerable online imagery and footage of those involved, and they should expect us to be at their doors very soon,"" Butterfield warned.The violence has been fueled by far-right groups exploiting fears over immigration, particularly the increasing number of migrants crossing the English Channel. These groups have rallied support through social media, with slogans such as ""enough is enough"" and ""stop the boats."" Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, has been identified as a key figure in amplifying these messages, despite facing legal challenges and an arrest warrant.The recent violence has overwhelmed the criminal justice system, which is already struggling with a significant backlog of cases. Stephen Parkinson, Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales, stated that extra legal resources have been deployed to ensure swift prosecution of those involved in the unrest.Prime Minister Starmer’s administration faces mounting pressure to address the root causes of the violence and to ensure public safety amid the rise in far-right activity. As the country grapples with the aftermath of these events, questions remain about the broader implications for social cohesion and the response to far-right extremism in the UK.","Rioters attempted to set fire to a hotel housing asylum seekers in Rotherham.

US court upholds rule granting work permits for spouses of visa holders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-court-upholds-rule-granting-work-permits-for-spouses-of-visa-holders/articleshow/112264141.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

The United States appeals court consisting of a three-judge panel on Friday upheld a federal regulation that allows the spouses of H-1B visa holders to work in the country, saying a recent Supreme Court decision curtailing the powers, had no bearing on this particular case.The H-1B visa program is designed for highly skilled foreign professionals.The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that federal immigration law grants the US Department of Homeland Security extensive authority to regulate the conditions under which visa holders are admitted into the United States.The H-1B visa program is extensively utilised by the US technology sector to employ individuals in roles that necessitate specialised training or education. Prominent business organisations and technology giants, such as Google (a subsidiary of Alphabet), Amazon.com, and Microsoft, that had filed briefs with a lower court backing the 2015 rule.These companies, in alignment with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) argued that permitting the spouses of H-1B visa holders to work in the United States would encourage these skilled workers to pursue permanent residency through green cards.This, in turn, would facilitate the retention of highly qualified employees by the companies that employ them.The District of Columbia Circuit upheld a ruling made by a federal judge in Washington, dismissing a lawsuit filed in 2015 by Save Jobs USA, the organisation, which represents former Southern California Edison employees, claimed that they were replaced by immigrant workers.The court found that the lawsuit, which challenged the legality of the rule, was similar to a case decided by the DC Circuit in 2022. In that case, the court rejected a challenge to a different regulation that allows foreign students to stay and work in the United States after completing their studies, as stated in the ruling issued.Save Jobs USA had argued that the 2022 ruling was wrong and inapplicable to their legal action, as it was issued by the US Supreme Court's in a case called Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo in June, which limited the power of federal agencies.The Supreme Court's ruling abolished the long-established ""Chevron deference,"" a principle that required courts to yield to reasonable interpretations of ambiguous laws by the federal agencies responsible for enforcing them.However, the DC Circuit determined that although its 2022 decision mentioned Chevron as a ""fallback argument,"" the court had independently found that the challenged rule in that case was clearly authorised by federal law, and said that was also true of the regulation at issue in Friday's decision.",The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that federal immigration law grants the US Department of Homeland Security extensive authority to regulate the conditions under which visa holders are admitted into the United States.

Tropical storm Debby threatens Florida's Gulf Coast with historic rainfall and major flooding,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tropical-storm-debby-threatens-floridas-gulf-coast-with-historic-rainfall-and-major-flooding/articleshow/112274490.cms,"Tropical Storm Debby intensified rapidly on Sunday as it approached Florida's Gulf Coast , with meteorologists warning that it could soon escalate to hurricane strength. The storm, churning through the unusually warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, poses a significant threat of life-threatening storm surge and unprecedented flooding.According to the National Hurricane Center (NHC), Debby is expected to become a hurricane by Sunday night and make landfall in Florida's Big Bend region around midday Monday.The NHC has issued dire warnings of a storm surge reaching six to ten feet (1.8 to 3.0 meters) above ground level in some areas, which could result in severe inundation.Governor Ron DeSantis, during an emergency briefing, emphasized the gravity of the situation. ""We are looking at potentially really, really significant flooding, particularly in north-central Florida,"" he said. He urged residents to complete their final preparations immediately as the storm's impact becomes imminent.As of 5:00 pm EDT, Debby was approximately 120 miles (190 kilometers) west of Tampa, with maximum sustained winds of 65 miles per hour and a northward movement of 12 miles per hour. The storm's intensification is expected to continue, heightening concerns about its potential impact.In anticipation of Debby’s arrival, mandatory evacuations were ordered late Saturday for parts of Citrus County. Additionally, voluntary evacuation orders were issued for eight other counties. Local authorities are stressing the importance of heeding these orders. ""Take the situation seriously,"" advised Paul Hasenmeier, Hernando County fire chief and public safety director. ""We know the water's going to come up as the storm passes.""The NHC forecasts that Debby could bring between six to twelve inches of rain to various parts of Florida, with coastal Georgia and South Carolina potentially receiving 20 to 30 inches by the end of the week. The prospect of ""potentially historic heavy rainfall"" raises fears of severe flash flooding, particularly in areas unaccustomed to such conditions.Governors of both Georgia and South Carolina have declared states of emergency as a precautionary measure. President Joe Biden has also approved an emergency declaration for Florida, facilitating expedited federal aid to support the storm response.DeSantis has activated the state's National Guard, positioning 3,000 service members on standby to assist with emergency operations and recovery efforts. The coordinated response aims to mitigate the impact of what could be a historic weather event.Residents along the Gulf Coast and the southeastern US are urged to remain vigilant and follow local advisories as Tropical Storm Debby continues its perilous path.",Tropical Storm Debby is expected to become a hurricane by Sunday night and make landfall in Florida's Big Bend region around midday Monday.

US election: Kamala Harris to interview these three candidates at her home for vice president pick,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-election-kamala-harris-to-interview-these-three-candidates-at-her-home-for-vice-president-pick/articleshow/112274483.cms,"Vice President Kamala Harris is set to interview three leading candidates for her running mate position at her Washington, DC, residence on Sunday. The candidates include Minnesota governor Tim Walz , US senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, and Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro .According to a report from Reuters, Harris is expected to make her decision public as early as Monday, with a social media announcement featuring the chosen candidate planned for Tuesday in Philadelphia.On Saturday, Harris met with her vetting team, including former attorney general Eric Holder, whose law firm provided detailed presentations on each of the finalists. She also held a 90-minute meeting with transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg on Friday and has been conducting virtual meetings with other candidates, including Kentucky governor Andy Beshear and Illinois governor J B Pritzker.The selection of a running mate is a crucial decision for Harris as she quickly assembles a campaign to challenge Donald Trump in the November 5 election following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race last month. Her shortlist consists entirely of white men known for appealing to rural, white, or independent voters, and her choice will have an impact on the future direction of the Democratic Party.Governor Shapiro, a top contender, has faced criticism from progressive groups and pro-Palestinian activists over his support for Israel and his handling of college protests related to the Gaza war. Some argue that selecting Shapiro as a running mate could hinder progress on issues such as Gaza policy and a pro-working class agenda.Additionally, his handling of a sexual harassment complaint against a top aide and his support for voucher programs that direct public funds to private schools have drawn criticism from labour groups, including the United Auto Workers (UAW) union.Senator Kelly has also faced criticism from labour groups for not supporting proposed legislation that they believe would strengthen union organising. Despite endorsing Harris for president, the UAW has said that it does not support either Kelly or Shapiro as potential running mates.Governor Walz, at 60 years old, has become a favourite among progressives and youth groups who appreciate his attacks on Trump. However, some critics argue that he appears much older than Harris, which could be a disadvantage for a campaign recovering from concerns about Biden's age. Walz addressed this criticism on X, attributing his appearance to his 20-year career as a high school teacher and lunchroom supervisor.","Kamala Harris is set to interview three leading candidates for her running mate position at her Washington, DC, residence on Sunday.

15 Russian 'neutrals' at Olympics are politically isolated & rarely in spotlight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/15-russian-neutrals-at-olympics-are-politically-isolated-rarely-in-spotlight/articleshow/112274275.cms,"PARIS: Rarely on the podium and barred from the opening ceremony, the 15 Russians competing at the Paris Olympics have an uneasy status as ""Individual Neutral Athletes "" following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Some in the Olympic Village opposed them taking part in the Summer Games, and Russian opinion is divided. In Russia, the Olympics aren't being shown on TV and some politicians and media figures have even described those willing to compete in Paris as traitors.It's a complex environment for the athletes, some of them teenagers, to navigate and they're wary of talking about politics or the war. ""My family is proud of me, that's all that matters,"" said tennis player Diana Shnaider.The 20-year-old former college player for North Carolina State said it was ""amazing"" to be at her first Olympics. ""There are still a lot of people from my country in the stands... I heard words of encouragement today,"" she said after winning in Thursday's quarterfinals.Tennis players like Shnaider and 2021 US Open winner Daniil Medvedev are used to dealing with the media and playing around the world without a Russian flag. Others seem a little overwhelmed. Anzhela Bladtceva, a 19-year-old trampolinist, placed fifth in her event Friday and clutched a stuffed animal as she spoke with media afterward. ""There are so many emotions, so many people, everyone is so kind and happy and so helpful,"" she said.National delegations sailed down the Seine River on a flotilla of boats in the opening ceremony, but the neutral athletes weren't included. ""It's upsetting that they didn't let us, but what can you do?"" said Bladtceva. Of the 32 ""neutral"" athletes in Paris, 17 previously represented Belarus and just 15 represented Russia. That's compared to more than 300 Russians at the last Summer Games in Tokyo. International Olympic Committee restrictions barred Russian athletes who are in the military or publicly supported the invasion of Ukraine. The IOC also blocked Russians from team sports. Track and field enforced its own blanket ban.In gymnastics and weightlifting, Russia's teams skipped qualifying events in protest of being forced to compete as neutrals or to undergo vetting, including checks of their social media. Some athletes even qualified, accepted their IOC invitations, then withdrew weeks before Olympics began. It wasn't clear whether they made that decision under pressure.When a neutral athlete wins a gold medal, an ""anthem"" commissioned by the IOC plays: More like the soundtrack to an inspirational video. Their medals don't count in Olympics' official table. At least 82 athletes at the Paris Olympics were born in Russia, including the neutral athletes. That leaves more than 60 competing for other nations. Some have lived outside Russia for years or moved abroad as children. Others switched their sporting allegiance since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Some Ukrainians view changes of allegiance with suspicion, too. Fencing champion Olga Kharlan said last month that Russian athletes who switched allegiance to other countries' teams after the invasion ""should be checked more"".","The 15 Russians competing at the Paris Olympics have an uneasy status as ""Individual Neutral Athletes "" Some in the Olympic Village opposed them taking part in the Summer Games, and Russian opinion is divided.

Last month, five people were killed in a powerful car bomb blast at a café in the capital. In March, the militants launched an hours-long siege on a Mogadishu hotel, killing three and wounding 27.","Al-Shabaab, a jihadist group linked to Al-Qaeda, claimed responsibility for the assault. The security forces managed to end the siege, killing all five gunmen involved. The sixth member of the group ""blew himself at the beach,"" he confirmed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112242485,imgsize-50494,width-400,resizemode-4/112242485.jpg"

This initiative follows a coordinated defense in April, during which Israeli air defenses , supported by the US and other allies, repelled an Iranian missile and drone attack.The current situation has heightened tensions, with fears of a broader conflict in the Middle East as Iran threatens retaliation for the recent assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, a political leader of Hamas.Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant stressed the need for a coalition to defend against Iran's proxies, highlighting recent security developments in talks with his American and British counterparts, Lloyd Austin and John Healey. Gallant said, ""Meeting with senior leaders across the region, including today in Israel, we urged all sides to show restraint and dial down the tension at this critical moment.""

President Joe Biden has assured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of additional US military deployments, while also urging a cease-fire in Gaza to mitigate the humanitarian crisis.The potential for escalation is high, with Iran's options ranging from direct attacks on Israel to increased aggression by its regional proxies. This follows the killing of Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut and the subsequent assassination of Haniyeh in Tehran. While Israel has not explicitly claimed responsibility for these killings, it has not denied involvement either.President Biden, in a statement, emphasising the importance of a cease-fire said, ""Meeting with senior leaders across the region, including today in Israel, we urged all sides to show restraint and dial down the tension at this critical moment."" The President has struggled to influence Netanyahu's war strategy, seeking to pressure him publicly and privately but stopping short of leveraging the billions of dollars in US military aid. UK defence secretary John Healey also called for restraint and urged the need for an immediate cease-fire and humanitarian aid for Gaza. Despite international criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza, Netanyahu continues to focus on the existential threat posed by Iran and its allies, including Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis in Yemen, all of which are part of the so-called Axis of Resistance.The proposed ""Abraham Alliance"" could serve as a strategic framework for regional security, potentially including both military and diplomatic efforts to contain Iran's influence and prevent further escalation.","Israel is seeking to form an "" Abraham Alliance "" with the United States and the United Kingdom.

The NHC has cautioned about the potential for life-threatening storm surges.As of Sunday evening, Debby had sustained winds of 70 mph (112 km/h), just shy of hurricane status. The storm is expected to bring storm surges of up to 10 feet (3 meters) in certain areas.As it slowly progresses northward throughout the week, Debby may bring ""potentially historic rainfall"" of 10 to 20 inches (25 to 50 cm) and devastating flooding to Georgia and South Carolina , with some local areas possibly receiving up to 30 inches of rain by Friday morning.Jamie Rhome, the deputy director of the hurricane centre, emphasised that the slow-moving nature of the storm will result in historic rainfall amounts and catastrophic flooding. He compared Debby to Hurricane Harvey, which caused extensive damage and over 100 deaths in Texas in 2017, primarily due to flooding in the Houston area.Rhome attributed Debby's strength to the exceptionally warm Gulf waters, which climate scientists believe have been influenced by man-made global warming from the burning of fossil fuels.In preparation for Debby, Florida governor Ron DeSantis has mobilised 3,000 National Guard troops and placed most of the state's cities and counties under emergency orders.Mandatory evacuations have been ordered in parts of the Gulf Coast counties of Citrus, Dixie, Franklin, Levy, and Wakulla. DeSantis also said that more than 17,000 linemen and other electric workers are ready to restore power if needed. The governors of Georgia and South Carolina have also declared states of emergency in anticipation of the storm.","Tropical Storm Debby has sustained winds of 70 mph (112 km/h), just shy of hurricane status.

Pelosi mentioned she and her husband have not discussed the incident, with doctors advising against revisiting the traumatic experience.The assailant had been targeting her, and Pelosi has expressed feelings of guilt about the event.In her book ""The Art of Power,"" she recalls her daughter suggesting she give up her political career following the attack, but Pelosi reflects on her family’s blame towards certain elements of the Republican Party for demonizing her over the years, reported CBS News.""My husband and I have never talked about this,"" Pelosi said. ""The doctors have supported that, because they don't want him to revisit it."" ""He was looking for me,"" she added. ""Imagine the guilt of all of that – it's just a horrible thing.""Pelosi's daughter, Alexandra Pelosi, urged her mother to leave public life after the attack. Pelosi reflects on this in her book and discusses the family's perspective on who is to blame. ""Well, I blame me. I mean, not blame me. I was the target. My family, frankly, blames certain elements of the Republican Party who had been demonizing me for about 20 years, every election and the rest – cloven feet, horns on the head, a horrible person, in flames, a devil, and all of that.

Who's going to be Kamala Harris' running mate",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/2024-us-elections-walz-kelly-or-shapiro-whos-going-to-be-kamala-harris-running-mate-as-vice-president/articleshow/112268214.cms,"Here is all you need to know about the Vice-presidential candidates:

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz

US Senator Mark Kelly

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro

Vice President Kamala Harris will interview three top candidates for her running mate at her Washington, DC, home on Sunday. The candidates are Minnesota Governor Tim Walz , US Senator Mark Kelly from Arizona, and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. Harris is expected to announce her choice by Monday, with a social media reveal planned for Tuesday in Philadelphia.Harris met with her team, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, who reviewed each candidate's background.She also had a meeting with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The selected candidate will be informed on Monday night or Tuesday morning.This choice is important for Harris as she prepares to run against Donald Trump in the November 5 election after President Biden withdrew. Her shortlist includes only white men who are seen as able to attract key voter groups. The choice will also impact the future of the Democratic Party.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, 60, has recently gained attention as a possible running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris. Walz, who used to be a high school teacher and a National Guard member, has been visible in supporting Harris and making appearances on major news channels. A notable moment was when he appeared at a St. Paul event in a grey T-shirt and camouflage hat, which went viral.Although Walz hasn’t confirmed if he’s received vetting materials from Harris's team, he’s grateful for the consideration. Political analyst David Schultz notes that Walz's rise as a candidate is surprising, given his previous low profile.While Walz's support among progressives and youth is strong, some critics are concerned that his age might be a disadvantage, as he is close in age to Harris and recent debates have focused on Biden’s age.Mark Kelly, a US Senator from Arizona, is considered a strong candidate for Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate. Kelly’s background as a Navy pilot and astronaut, along with his work on gun control with his wife Gabrielle Giffords, makes him stand out.He first won his Senate seat in a special election against Republican Martha McSally and was re-elected in 2024. Kelly’s centrist approach helps him appeal to a broad range of voters, which could be beneficial in swing states like Arizona.However, some progressives may criticize his centrist stance and his views on labour issues, which could affect his appeal within the Democratic Party. Kelly is criticised by labour groups for opposing union-friendly legislation.Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro is a top candidate for Kamala Harris’s vice-presidential pick due to his strong performance and high approval ratings. At 51, Shapiro has held several important roles, including state representative, Montgomery County Board Chair, Attorney General, and now Governor.His victory in the gubernatorial race against a Trump-backed Republican and high approval ratings make him a strong contender, especially in the key state of Pennsylvania.Despite his success, Shapiro faces criticism from some progressives who are concerned about his decisions on issues like school choice and the environment. These critics worry that choosing Shapiro could cause problems for the Democratic ticket, even though they recognize his contributions to the party.Shapiro has faced criticism from progressives and pro-Palestinian activists over his support for Israel and handling of college protests related to Gaza. His support for private school vouchers and handling of a sexual harassment complaint have also been questioned.","Vice President Kamala Harris will interview three top candidates for her running mate at her Washington, DC, home on Sunday.

VP campaign launches 'Republicans for Harris' in push to win over GOP voters put off by Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/vp-campaign-launches-republicans-for-harris-in-push-to-win-over-gop-voters-put-off-by-trump/articleshow/112268087.cms,"WASHINGTON: Vice President Kamala Harris ' campaign on Sunday is launching “Republicans for Harris” as she looks to win over Republican voters put off by Donald Trump 's candidacy.The program will be a “campaign within a campaign,” according to Harris' team, using well-known Republicans to activate their networks, with a particular emphasis on primary voters who backed former U.N.Ambassador Nikki Haley. The program will kick off with events this week in Arizona, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Republicans backing Harris will also appear at rallies with the vice president and her soon-to-be-named running mate this coming week, the campaign said.The Harris campaign shared the details of the program first with The Associated Press before the official announcement.It is trying to create “a permission structure” for GOP voters who would otherwise have a difficult time voting for Harris. The effort will rely heavily on Republican-to-Republican voter contact, with the belief that the best way to get a Republican to vote for Harris is to hear directly from another Republican making the same choice.Trump's ""extremism is toxic to the millions of Republicans who no longer believe the party of Donald Trump represents their values"" and will vote against him again in November, said Harris' national director of Republican outreach, Austin Weatherford. He said the campaign would be ""showing up and taking the time every single day to earn the vote of Republicans who believe in putting country over party and know that every American deserves a president who will protect their freedoms and a commander in chief who will put the best interests of the American people above their own.”Weatherford is a onetime chief of staff to former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., who had endorsed the Biden-Harris ticket before President Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance against Trump. Kinzinger is backing Harris once more as part of the launch.“As a proud conservative, I never thought I’d be endorsing a Democrat for President,"" he said in a statement. “But, I know Vice President Harris will defend our democracy and ensure Donald Trump never returns to the White House.”Kinzinger developed a national profile as one of two Republicans on the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. The committee highlighted a number of Trump’s transgressions before and during the deadly attack as Congress tried to certify the results of the 2020 election that Biden won over Trump.Trump has done little to try to win over moderate Republican voters and on Saturday criticized anew Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who rebuffed Trump 's attempts to overturn the 2020 election in the battleground state.Last month, when Biden was still at the top of the ticket, the campaign went out with an ad highlighting former Trump staffers' criticism of their onetime boss. A separate ad highlighted Trump’s often-personal attacks against Haley, including his primary nickname of her as “birdbrain” and suggestion that “she’s not presidential timber.”Hundreds of thousands of registered Republicans voted in primaries for Haley even after she ended her bid for the 2024 Republican nomination and as Trump trounced her in almost every contest.Haley in May announced she would vote for Trump and appeared at last month's Republican National Convention.The Harris campaign's effort includes former Govs. Bill Weld of Massachusetts and Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, and 16 former Republican members of Congress, including Kinzinger and Reps. Joe Walsh of Illinois and Susan Molinari of New York. All have been notable critics of Trump in the past.Former Trump press secretary Stephanie Grisham is also endorsing Harris.“I might not agree with Vice President Kamala Harris on everything, but I know that she will fight for our freedom, protect our democracy and represent America with honor and dignity on the world stage,"" Grisham said in a statement.","The program will be a “campaign within a campaign,’ according to Harris' team. It is trying to create “a permission structure’ for GOP voters who would otherwise have a difficult time voting for Harris. The program will kick off with events this week in Arizona, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112268092,imgsize-44538,width-400,resizemode-4/112268092.jpg"

Several political parties have extensively used X to present their case.The most notable is the Pakistan-Tehreek-e-Insaaf, whose jailed leader former PM Imran Khan has used X to present his point of view on various cases against him. The PTI has also used X to call for rallies and protests against the Shehbaz Sharif government. Even on Saturday, the PTI X timeline was abuzz with calls for the national protest rally in Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Khan has also been able to address election rallies using Artificial Intelligence and pushed his cause effectively on social media.In a statement posted by the PTI's Canada office, the party criticised the move saying the government was scared of informed voices.""First they ban X on flimsy 'national security' grounds, now they're coming for VPNs. The PTA must be terrified of an informed and connected populace. Why is the government so terrified of its own citizens' voices?"" the post on X from PTI Canada read.The call to ban VPNs has met with severe criticism by netizens who posted on X about their misgivings on this move. An editorial in Dawn on Saturday said such a move would deprive people of chances to realise their potential.""All of this would suggest that the effort to wall in its people and control their lives virtually may only end up pushing the country even further behind in the global race for digital supremacy. For a nation largely comprising very young people, this would be an unmitigated disaster as it could have repercussions that may spill over generations. Already struggling to compete, the Pakistpeople will end up being deprived of even more chances to realise their potential and contribute positively on a global scale,"" the editorial said.According to the website DataReportal, there were 71.70 million active social media user identities in Pakistan in January 2024. YouTube is Pakistan's most-used social media platform in 2024 with a potential ad audience of 71.70 million. Data published in the ad planning tools of top social media platforms indicates that there were 54.38 million users aged 18 and above using social media in Pakistan at the start of 2024, which was equivalent to 38.9 per cent of the total population aged 18 and above at that time.Meanwhile, according to Samaa TV, the Pakistan government has made previous attempts to regulate VPN usage by requiring registration, but these efforts have not resulted in significant action. In 2022, the PTA asked public and private sector organizations, foreign missions, and freelancers to register their VPNs to avoid disruptions. The PTA also passed VPN regulations in 2010, but enforcement has been inconsistent.","Pakistan's Telecommunication Authority is planning to regulate VPN usage in Pakistan by whitelisting certain proxy networks and blocking others.

Just hours before his assassination, Israel had struck a southern suburb of Beirut, killing Fuad Shukr, the military commander of Hezbollah, the Hamas-allied Lebanese militant group, deepening concerns of a wider regional escalation.Haniyeh’s death was the key topic at mosques during Friday sermons. Some clerics lashed out at leaders of the Muslim ummah for their weak stance on the Palestinian cause.

Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, who addressed reporters alongside the party's secretary-general Omar Ayub Khan outside Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail where the 71-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician is lodged since last August, said that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has decided to expand the opposition alliance in a meeting with Imran Khan on Thursday, Geo News reported.Qaiser announced that the former ruling party would gather all opposition parties to run a powerful anti-government movement. He said that the party's forthcoming power show in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Swabi was aimed at raising a ""strong voice"" for the release of the PTI founder and other detained leaders.""This country will only be governed in accordance with the law and the Constitution,"" Qaiser emphasised.During his address, Qaiser also rebuked the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz-led coalition government over skyrocketing power bills.
