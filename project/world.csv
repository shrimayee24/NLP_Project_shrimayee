Main accused surrenders to Delhi Police

Rahul Gandhi visits Hathras

NEW DELHI: Self-proclaimed godman Surajpal Singh aka 'Bhole Baba' or Narayan Sakar Hari on Saturday broke his silence on the devastating Hathras stampede incident. In a video statement, he said that he has complete faith in the government and ""the one who created chaos in Hathras, would not be spared"".The incident occurred earlier this week during a 'Satsang' in Fulari village, Hathras district, which led to the death of over 120 people, mainly women and children.In a conversation with news agency ANI, ' Bhola Baba ' in Mainpuri said, ""... I am deeply saddened after the incident of July 2. May God give us the strength to bear this pain. Please keep faith in the government and the administration. I have faith that anyone who created the chaos would not be spared.""""Through my lawyer AP Singh, I have requested the members of the committee to stand with the bereaved families and the injured and help them throughout their lives,"" he added.Following the stampede at his 'satsang' in Hathras district, which claimed 121 lives and injured 31, Baba is said to be present at an ashram in Mainpuri.A large number of police personnel have been deployed outside the ashram, and officials remain tight-lipped about Baba's presence inside.Preliminary reports suggest that the stampede occurred when devotees rushed to seek blessings and collect soil from around the preacher's feet, but were stopped by his security personnel. This led to pushing and shoving, causing several people to fall and triggering the chaos that ensued.The police FIR indicates that approximately 250,000 people had gathered for the event, despite permission being granted for only 80,000 attendees.Meanwhile, Devprakash Madhukar, the main accused in the tragic stampede, surrendered to the Uttar Pradesh Police in Delhi on Friday night, as confirmed by his lawyer.Madhukar, the 'mukhya sevadar' of the 'satsang' where the stampede occurred, is the only accused named in the FIR filed at Sikandra Rao police station in Hathras.In a video message, Madhukar's lawyer AP Singh said, ""Today, we have surrendered Devprakash Madhukar, who has been called the main organiser in the FIR in the Hathras case, after calling the police, the SIT and the STF in Delhi since he was undergoing treatment here.""Singh emphasized that they did not seek anticipatory bail, asserting Madhukar's innocence. ""What is our crime? He is an engineer and a heart patient. Doctors said his condition is stable now and so we surrendered today to join the probe,"" he explained.Madhukar's lawyer urged the police to consider his client's health condition during the investigation. ""Police may now record his statement or question him but they must take into consideration his health condition and ensure that nothing wrong happens with him.""Singh also mentioned that questions were being raised about Madhukar's whereabouts, dispelling rumors of him fleeing. ""We did not do anything like filing anticipatory bail or moving court which would have been viewed as an effort to save ourselves and being scared,"" Singh stated.Madhukar will assist the investigation by providing information about the ""anti-social elements"" present at the event. Uttar Pradesh Police had earlier announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh for information leading to Madhukar's arrest.In the aftermath of the tragedy, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi visited Hathras and met with the victims' families. During his journey, Gandhi also stopped in Aligarh to meet other affected families.Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath has announced financial assistance of Rs 2 lakh for the families of the deceased and Rs 50,000 for those injured.A three-member Judicial Inquiry Commission, chaired by Justice (retd) Brijesh Kumar Srivastava, has been established to ensure a comprehensive and transparent investigation. The commission will examine the stampede incident over the next two months and submit its report to the state government.","Self-proclaimed godman Surajpal Singh aka 'Bhole Baba' breaks his silence.

In such like cases, the presumption stipulated under Section 114-A ofIndian Evidence Act , 1872 cannot come to the aid of the prosecution/complainant,” held the court while allowing the petition filed by the accused against the FIR and the charges framed against him in the rape case.In this case both the complainant and the accused had met in August 2016 at the Delhi airport and after having extramarital affairs for around five years, the woman filed a complaint against him for rape in 2021. The accused is a senior officer with CRPF and the complaint was working in a private company. Both were married and having grown up children.Considering the facts and circumstances in the case, the judge observed that it cannot be legally and validly construed that there was any alleged promise to marry on part of the petitioner, which made the complainant vary her stand and communicate her consent to make physical relations with the petitioner.",HC has passed these orders while discharging an officer of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) who was booked for rape charges by Gurgaon police.

2024 United Kingdom elections: Who is Keir Starmer? Britain's next prime minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/2024-united-kingdom-elections-who-is-keir-starmer-poised-to-become-uks-next-pm/articleshow/111496432.cms,"All you need to know about Keir Starmer

Keir Starmer was born in London in 1962 and grew up in the town of Oxted, Surrey, where he was raised by his toolmaker father and NHS nurse mother.[3]

He was politically active from a young age, joining the Labour Party Young Socialists at 16.

Starmer has a strong academic background, holding a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Leeds and a postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law degree from the University of Oxford.

Prior to entering politics, Starmer had a successful career as a human rights barrister, serving as a human rights adviser to the Northern Ireland Policing Board and being appointed Queen's Counsel in 2002.

Starmer was Director of Public Prosecutions from 2008 to 2013, where he dealt with high-profile cases like the Stephen Lawrence murder.

He was elected to the House of Commons in 2015 as the MP for Holborn and St Pancras, a safe Labour seat.

Starmer supported the unsuccessful Britain Stronger in Europe campaign during the 2016 Brexit referendum, but later advocated for a second referendum under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.

After Corbyn's resignation, Starmer won the 2020 Labour leadership election on a left-wing platform, positioning himself as a more centrist, pragmatic leader.[3]

As Labour leader, Starmer has sought to distance the party from the Corbyn era, emphasizing a more professional and electorally viable approach.[1][4]

Starmer is known for his vegetarianism, self-professed socialism, and a reputation that divides opinions, with some viewing him as moving towards the right in his pursuit of power.

Here are Keir Starmer's key policies as the likely next UK PM:

Economic stability: Starmer has pledged to ""deliver economic stability "" by sticking to ""tough spending rules"" and focusing on growing the economy. He has avoided making big-spending promises, instead emphasizing fiscal responsibility.

"" by sticking to ""tough spending rules"" and focusing on growing the economy. He has avoided making big-spending promises, instead emphasizing fiscal responsibility. NHS improvements : Starmer plans to ""cut NHS waiting times"" by providing 40,000 more evening and weekend appointments each week. This is aimed at addressing the NHS's staffing and backlog issues.

Border security: Starmer wants to ""launch a new Border Security Command"" to crack down on illegal migration and people-smuggling gangs. He has indicated a willingness to do a deal with the EU on migrant quotas.

Energy nationalisation: Starmer has promised to ""set up Great British Energy"", a new publicly owned clean power company, as part of Labour's plans for green energy transition.

Tackling anti-social behaviour: Starmer has pledged to ""crack down on anti-social behaviour"" as part of his law and order agenda.

Education funding: Starmer has committed to ""recruit 6,500 new teachers"" in key subjects to address staffing shortages in the education system.

Foreign policy: Starmer has promised a ""new strategic partnership"" with India, including pursuing a free trade agreement. He also plans to stop arms sales to Israel and progress towards recognizing a Palestinian state.

Keir Starmer is set to become the next prime minister of Britain, as his centre-left Labour Party is projected to secure a substantial majority in the parliamentary election.This victory will put an end to the 14-year reign of the Conservative government, which has been marked by frequent upheavals. Rishi Sunak's party suffered a resounding defeat in the polls.Labour has already secured more than 326 out of the 650 seats in parliament, and an exit poll indicates that the party is likely to win around 410 seats in total.After retaining his seat in north London, the 61-year-old Starmer addressed his constituents, saying, ""The change begins right here because this is your democracy, your community and your future. You have voted and now it is time for us to deliver.""Despite Starmer's decisive win, polls suggest that there is a lack of enthusiasm among the public for both him and his party. As he assumes power, he faces a multitude of formidable challenges that the country is currently grappling with.","Keir Starmer was born in London in 1962 and grew up in Oxted, Surrey.

Biden goes into make-or-break weekend with more gaffes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-goes-into-make-or-break-weekend-with-more-gaffes/articleshow/111520770.cms,"WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden is entering a make-or-break weekend with his political future and legacy hanging on an interview and two public rallies through which he will try and disprove the growing belief nationwide that he's is too old for a second stint in the White House .Biden is sitting down for an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos in course of campaign events in Wisconsin on Friday and chat is expected to be broadcast at 8pm east coast time.The platform is expected to be fair but tough on the President, with direct questions about his age and mental acuity . Stephenapoulus is a former Democratic Party advisor and served as the White House communications director and later as senior advisor to President Bill Clinton.Any flubs in the unscripted interview (where there will be no teleprompters) and in rallies (where there will be teleprompters) could close the door on the President's bid for a second term, with many Democratic operatives critical of his insistence on staying in the race, already leaning against it.Events on Thursday in the run-up to the interview were not encouraging for the Biden camp. The 81-year old President (he will be 82 on November 20) misspoke badly in a radio interview where he struggled to find words, at one point saying he was proud to have been “the first Black woman to serve with a Black president.” He evidently mixed up his time as Obama's vice-president and Kamala Harris' vice-presidency under him.At a separate Fourth of July White House event, Biden began talking about his predecessor not honoring military veterans, referring to Trump as “one of our colleagues, the former president” before lamely veering off with, “probably shouldn’t say, at any rate” and moving on to other matters.He also continued to undercut his own case by telling Democratic governors at a White House meeting that he needs to sleep more and not work after 8 p.m. -- which is perfectly acceptable in normal circumstances considering many other presidents did the same, but which raised eyebrows in the current situation. Even a joke to the governors -- “I’m fine — I don’t know about my brain, though” caused some supporters to grind their teeth.Dubbed a ""bloviator"" even during the Obama years for his propensity to be long-winded and voluble, Biden has always tripped over words and trailed off into non-sequiturs, with little critical attention. But his run for a second White House term at 82, at the conclusion of which -- if he wins -- he will be 86, has brought searing focus on whether he can do the job.There is growing fears in the party -- both among the elites and the rank and file -- that he can't and he should quit the race. There are reports in the mainstream media about fat-cat donors holding their money from the Biden campaign to redirect it to a potential replacement, with vice-president Kamala Harris at the top of the list.The lead headline on CNN on Friday morning read: Democrats start moving to Harris as Biden digs in. In fact, reports are already emerging about Harris' possible running mates, with leading Democratic governors, North Carolina's Roy Cooper, Kentucky's Andy Beshear, Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, and Illinois'J.B. Pritzker in the mix.""Despite her efforts (to stay behind Biden), Democratic politics has started to reshape around her -- as has former President Donald Trump’s campaign, which has already begun attacking Harris. Several officials told CNN they have begun chiding donors who complain that they don’t think she can win, arguing that they need to stop and get on board with her. Other officials and advisers said plans are underway to convince Biden to immediately throw his support behind Harris, release his Democratic delegates and ask them to follow his choice,"" the report said.",US President Joe Biden is entering a make-or-break weekend with his political future and legacy hanging on an interview and two public rallies.

Iran presidential runoff elections: Reformist Masoud Pezeshkian leads hard-liner Saeed Jalili,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iran-presidential-runoff-elections-reformist-masoud-pezeshkian-leads-hard-liner-saeed-jalili/articleshow/111527047.cms,"In the Iran presidential runoff elections , reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian is leading hard-liner Saeed Jalili by over 2 million votes early on Saturday.According to Reuters sources, Masoud Pezeshkian, moderate candidate known for maintaining a low profile, is projected to emerge victorious in the presidential run-off election that was held on Friday.The source, who requested anonymity, said, ""The vote counting has ended and the rival candidates have been informed about the result. Pezeshkian is around three million votes ahead of his hardline rival Saeed Jalili."" The results are yet to to be declared to the public.Earlier, it was reported that Pezeshkian has secured atleast 11.1 million votes against Jalili's 9 million, according to election spokesperson Mohsen Eslami.Based on preliminary results also, Pezeshkian was reported to be ahead in the election, according to the interior ministry.Footage circulating on various social media platforms depicted Pezeshkian's supporters celebrating his triumph by dancing in the streets of multiple cities and drivers expressing their joy through the honking of car horns.In Urmia, Pezeshkian's birthplace situated in the northwest, residents were seen distributing sweets to passersby on the streets as a gesture of celebration.Although the election is not anticipated to significantly influence the policies of the Islamic Republic, the president will play a crucial role in the selection process of the successor to the 85-year-old Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds the ultimate authority in making decisions on key matters concerning the state.This election follows the first round of voting on June 28, which saw the lowest turnout since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iran has traditionally highlighted voter turnout as an indication of support for its Shiite theocracy, which is currently under economic strain from sanctions and facing widespread demonstrations and harsh crackdowns on dissent.Pezeshkian, the only moderate among the initial four candidates, and Jalili, a hardline ex-nuclear negotiator who strongly supports strengthening relations with Russia and China were the top two candidates and thus, headed to the runoff elections.The ministry also reported that early figures indicate voter participation was approximately 50%, which is an increase compared to the initial round of voting. State television broadcasted footage of moderate queues at various polling stations throughout the nation.However contrasting videos circulating online seemed to present a different picture, with some polling centers appearing to be empty. A survey conducted across numerous locations in Tehran, the capital city, revealed a low voter turnout.","Reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian is leading hard-liner Saeed Jalili by over 2 million votes early on Saturday.

Nine people die in gas-filled wells in Chhattisgarh twin tragedies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/nine-people-die-in-gas-filled-wells-in-chhattisgarh-twin-tragedies/articleshow/111521063.cms,"RAIPUR: Nine persons suffocated to death when they entered gas-filled wells in Chhattisgarh’s Janjgir-Champa and Korba districts to save each other.Among the dead in the twin tragedies are a father and two sons, and four members of another family, including a minor girl. The govt has announced Rs 9 lakh compensation per victim.In Janjgir Champa’s Kikirda village, 160km from Raipur, the well wasn’t in use and had been covered up for years, said officials.Toxic gases had accumulated during this time, turning it into a death chamber. It was sealed with a wooden board, which had been tossed aside during a recent thunderstorm.While trying to cover it up again, farmer Ramchandra Jayaswal, 60, saw a small wooden slab inside the well, and decided to remove it. He climbed into the 40-ft-deep well, and never came back up.Half an hour later, when there was no sign of him, some family members tried to investigate and climbed a short way down the well. They saw he was floating unconscious in the slimy, smelly water, and shouted for help.Ramchandra’s friend and neighbour, 50-year-old Ramesh Patel, rushed to the rescue and clambered down the well. He didn’t return, either. Alarmed, Patel’s sons Rajendra, 20, and Jitendra, 25, went in after him and were also overcome by poisonous gases.The bodies lay in a heap but it didn’t deter another neighbour, 25-year-old Tikeshwar Chandra, from risking his life to save them. He too was killed by the fumes.The whole village was in shock. Despite the deaths , there were still some people in the close-knit community willing to launch a rescue effort but they were held back by the elders.Police and the administration were informed. SDERF personnel entered the well wearing gas masks and retrieved the bodies, SP Vivek Shukla said.Tikeshwar was married only three months ago and it was his wife’s birthday. She is inconsolable and unable to speak. Jitendra Patel, who was a farmer, is survived by his wife and a five-month old baby.A few hours later, 120km away, these same tragic scenes were repeated in Korba’s Jurali village.Jahru Patel, 60, slipped into the well and called for help. His 16-year-old daughter, Sapna, jumped into it in a bid to save him, but she gasped to death along with her father. Seeing them lying unresponsive in the well, two other family members, Manbodh, 57, and Shivcharan, 45, climbed down to save them, but they too were asphyxiated.Chief minister Vishnu Deo Sai extended his condolences and said his govt is fully committed to providing all possible assistance to the bereaving families.Police suspect gases like methane and carbon monoxide may have accumulated in the abandoned wells and oxygen would have depleted, due to which the victims were rapidly overcome. Water and gas samples from both wells have been collected and the reports are awaited. The bodies have been sent for autopsy.","Among the dead are a father and two sons, and four members of another family, including a minor girl.

She will also hold the brief of minister for levelling up, housing and communities, Downing Street said in a statement.The historic appointment has been of Rachel Reeves who has been given the responsibility of finance minister, or Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Labour government, making her the first woman in the UK to hold the role of finance minister.Starmer has appointed David Lammy as foreign secretary and Yvette Cooper as interior minister in the Cabinet.Lammy, 51, a trailblazing black lawmaker, replaces the Conservatives' David Cameron as Britain's top diplomat while Cooper, 55, takes the helm at the Home Office, a notoriously difficult ministry to run.The new UK PM has appointed Lisa Nandy the new culture secretary.Britain’s new Prime Minister Keir Starmer has taken office following a decisive electoral victory on Thursday, which ended 14 years of Conservative governance. His administration will oversee the most ethnically diverse and female-inclusive parliament in the country's history.Black, Asian, and ethnic minority lawmakers will now constitute approximately 13% of the House of Commons. This marks an increase from the 10% representation documented in 2019 during the last parliamentary election in Britain.According to an analysis by the think tank British Future, this will be the largest-ever share of ethnic minority members in the lower house.UK's centre-left Labour Party secured a sweeping victory in the general election, effectively ending 14 years of Conservative rule. Starmer's election marks the first Labour government since 2010, achieving a significant shift in the political landscape.The massive victory of the Labour Party managed to capture a significant number of traditionally Conservative seats across the country, leading to the defeat of several high-profile members of the Cabinet.","New UK PM Keir Starmer has appointed Angela Rayner as his deputy.

Lathering soap through the boy's hair, he wiggles and shivers as she pours the chilly water over his head, and he grips the plastic seats for balance.They’ve been displaced multiple times, she said, most recently from Israel’s renewed operations against Hamas in the Shijaiyah neighborhood of Gaza City.“We woke up and found tanks in front of the door,” she says. “We didn't take anything with us, not a mattress, not a pillow, not any clothes, not a thing. Not even food.”She fled with about 70 others to Yarmouk Sports Stadium — a little under 2 miles (3 kilometers) northwest of Shijaiyah, which was heavily bombed and largely emptied early in the war. Many of the people who ended up in the stadium say they have nothing to return to.“We left our homes,” said one man, Hazem Abu Thoraya, “and all of our homes were bombed and burned, and all those around us were as well.”Hundreds of thousands of people have remained in northern Gaza, even as Israeli troops have surrounded and largely isolated it. However, aid flows there have improved recently, and the U.N. said earlier this week that it is now able to meet people's basic needs in the north. Israel says it allows aid to enter Gaza and blames the U.N. for not doing enough to move it.Still, residents say the deprivation and insecurity are taking an ever-growing toll.“There is no safe place. Safety is with God,” said a displaced woman, Um Ahmad. “Fear is now felt not only among the children, but also among the adults. ... We don't even feel safe walking in the street.”","Hundreds of thousands of people have remained in northern Gaza, even as Israeli troops have surrounded and largely isolated it.

It will submit its report in two months.

Six others were injured, of which three died and three were recovering.Avian enthusiasts and environmental activists are seeking a thorough investigation to find the cause of the death. “We, in coordination with the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC), wrote to CIDCO to stop being careless about the DPS wetland, but the destruction continued,” said B N Kumar, the Director of NatConnect Foundation.","Six flamingos were found dead and another six were found injured, leading to an outcry from environmentalists.

President Joe Biden addressed concerns about his age and fitness for another term in office, rejecting the idea of an independent medical evaluation in a recent ABC interview with George Stephanopoulos. The 81-year-old president insisted that he undergoes daily cognitive tests through the rigorous tasks he faces in his job.""Look, I have a cognitive test every single day.Every day, I have that test. Everything I do. You know, not only am I campaigning, but I'm running the world"", Biden said.During the interview, Biden maintained that he is not more frail than earlier in his presidency, citing ongoing assessments by his personal doctors who would not hesitate to inform him of any issues. He acknowledged his limitations, saying, ""Can I run the 100 in 10 flat? No. But I'm still in good shape."" Regarding his debate performance, Biden admitted to not listening to his instincts in terms of preparation and allowing Trump's disruptions to distract him.Despite completing the 22-minute interview without major blunders, it remains uncertain whether Biden's performance will fully alleviate concerns about his ability to defeat Donald Trump in the upcoming November election.The drawn-out spectacle surrounding Biden's candidacy could benefit his efforts to remain in the race by limiting the party's options to replace him, but it may also distract from crucial efforts to frame the 2024 race as a referendum on Trump.At times, Biden's responses during the interview were rambling, veering from topic to topic. When asked how he might turn the race around, he highlighted the importance of large and energetic rallies, like the one he held in Wisconsin. Biden also insisted that he is the ""most qualified"" to lead Democrats against Trump, whom he accused of being a ""pathological liar"" and failing to create jobs or benefit anyone but himself.The interview, along with weekend campaigns in battleground states, is part of Biden's effort to course-correct from his rocky debate performance. However, internal party frustrations continue to simmer, with some Democrats quietly discussing alternative options if the president drops out or the implications of him staying in the race. One influential Democratic senator is reportedly working on a nascent push to encourage Biden to exit the race.Despite the private angst among Democratic lawmakers, donors, and strategists, most in the party have refrained from public criticism as they wait to see if the president can restore confidence through his weekend travel and handling of the interview. The top Democrats on House committees are planning a virtual meeting to discuss the situation, while at least four House Democrats have called for Biden to step down as the nominee.In the interview, Biden laughed off the idea of being persuaded to leave the race, saying, ""If the Lord Almighty comes down and tells me that, I might do that."" However, there were a few signs of discontent at his campaign rally, with one person waving a sign reading ""Pass the torch Joe"" and a few people urging him to move on.The question of Biden's fitness for another term remains a contentious issue within the Democratic party as the 2024 election approaches. While some supporters find his energy reassuring, others are deeply frustrated and split on whether he should stay or go.",President Joe Biden addressed concerns about his age and fitness for another term in office.

Reformist faces ultraconservative as Iran votes for president,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/reformist-faces-ultraconservative-as-iran-votes-for-president/articleshow/111521349.cms,"Low turnout

'Fed up'

TEHRAN: Iranians voted Friday in a presidential election runoff between a reformist advocating improved ties with the West and an ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator.The election, called early after the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash, follows a first round marked by a historically low turnout last week.The runoff between reformist Masoud Pezeshkian and ultraconservative Saeed Jalili comes amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, Iran's nuclear standoff with the West and widespread economic discontent exacerbated by Western sanctions.Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in all state matters in Iran, cast his ballot when polls opened.""I heard that the enthusiasm and interest of the people is more than before, praise to God that it will be like this, and if it is like this, it will be gratifying,"" he said.State television showed voters queueing in Saveh in central Iran and Kerman in the south, but AFP correspondents said polling stations appeared less busy in Tehran.In last week's first round, Pezeshkian, who was the only reformist permitted to stand, won the largest number of votes, around 42 percent, while Jalili came second with 39 percent, according to figures from Iran's elections authority.Only 40 percent of Iran's 61 million eligible voters took part -- the lowest turnout in any presidential election since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.In past elections, authorities have extended polling hours to give voters the maximum time to turn out and the interior ministry announced that they would again be extended on Friday, until 10:00 pm (1830 GMT).Khamenei called for a higher turnout in the runoff, emphasising the importance of the election.He said the first round turnout was lower than expected, but added that it was not an act ""against the system"".The election was originally scheduled for 2025 but was brought forward by Raisi's death in a helicopter crash in May.Pezeshkian and Jalili have taken part in two televised debates during which they discussed the low turnout, as well as Iran's economic woes, international relations and internet restrictions.Pezeshkian vowed to ""fully"" oppose police patrols enforcing the mandatory headscarf for women, a high-profile issue since the death in police custody in 2022 of Mahsa Amini.The 22-year-old Iranian Kurd had been detained for an alleged breach of the dress code and her death sparked months of nationwide unrest.Following the unrest, women increasingly flouted the code but police have again stepped up checks in recent months.At a Tehran polling station, 48-year-old Fatemeh said she voted for the reformist whose ""priorities include women and young people's rights.""The candidacy of Pezeshkian, a relative unknown until recently, has raised the hopes of Iran's reformists after years of dominance by the conservative and ultraconservative camps.Jalili, noted for his uncompromising anti-Western position, mobilised a substantial base of hardline support and received backing from other ultraconservative candidates.While campaigning, the 58-year-old criticised moderates for having signed the 2015 deal which promised Iran sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.Jalili said the accord, which the United States withdrew from in 2018 under then-president Donald Trump, ""did not benefit Iran at all"".""I voted for Jalili because the next president should not repeat the previous mistake and sign a new agreement with the West,"" said Ali, a 38-year-old university professor, at a polling station in central Tehran.""They deceived us once and that's enough. Their promises cannot be trusted,"" said Ali, who gave only his first name.Pezeshkian, a 69-year-old heart surgeon, has called for ""constructive relations"" with Western countries to revive the nuclear deal in order to ""get Iran out of its isolation"".Pezeshkian voted at a school west of Tehran where he was accompanied by former foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who helped clinch the 2015 deal.A member of parliament representing the northwestern city of Tabriz since 2008, he has earned the support of Iran's reformists, with former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani backing his candidacy.Casting his ballot on Friday, Khatami urged Iranians to vote ""for the future and good of the country"".Pezeshkian said people were ""fed up with their living conditions... and dissatisfied with the government's management of affairs.""Jalili has held several senior positions, including in Khamenei's office in the early 2000s.He is currently one of Khamenei's representatives in the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's highest security body.","Iranians vote in presidential runoff between reformist Masoud Pezeshkian and ultraconservative Saeed Jalili. runoff comes amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, Iran's nuclear standoff with the West and widespread economic discontent.

NEW DELHI: Keir Starmer's Labour Party is poised to win a historic victory in the UK general election, ending 14 years of Conservative rule , according to exit polls released shortly after voting ended on Thursday.Labour is projected to secure 410 seats in the 650-seat parliament, while Rishi Sunak 's Conservatives are forecast to win only 131 seats, down from 346 previously.The Liberal Democrats are predicted to capture 61 seats, and Nigel Farage's Reform UK party is expected to win 13 seats. The exit poll represents a significant turnaround for Labour, which faced an existential crisis just three years ago.Voters appear to have punished the Conservatives for the cost-of-living crisis, years of instability, and in-fighting that has seen five different prime ministers since 2016. Sunak's campaign was plagued by gaffes, including getting drenched by rain while announcing the election and leaving D-Day commemorations early for a TV interview.While polls suggest there is no great enthusiasm for Starmer, his message of change seems to have resonated with voters. The disenchanted British public has moved to the center-left, unlike in France where the far-right National Rally party made historic gains in a recent election.If the exit poll proves accurate, Starmer will become Britain's next prime minister, and Sunak will resign, meeting with King Charles to seek permission to form a new government.","Labour is projected to secure 410 seats in the 650-seat parliament.

Any flubs at the events could close the door on the prez's bid for a second term, with many Democratic operatives critical of his insistence on staying in the race already leaning against it.Events on Thursday in the run-up to the interview were not encouraging for the Biden camp. The 81-year old prez (he will be 82 on Nov 20) misspoke badly in a radio interview where he struggled to find words, at one point saying he was proud to have been ""the first black woman to serve with a black president"". He evidently mixed up his time as Obama's vice-president and Kamala Harris ' vice-presidency under him.At a separate Fourth of July White House event, Biden began talking about his predecessor not honouring military veterans, referring to Trump as ""one of our colleagues, the former president"" before lamely veering off with, ""probably shouldn't say, at any rate"" and moving on to other matters.He also continued to undercut his own case by telling Democratic governors at a White House meeting that he needs to sleep more and not work after 8 pm, which raised eyebrows in the current situation. Even a joke to the governors - ""I'm fine - I don't know about my brain, though"" - caused some supporters to grind their teeth.There is growing fear in the party that he can't take on the role and should quit the race. There are reports in the mainstream media about fat-cat donors holding their money from the Biden campaign to redirect it to a potential replacement, with vice-president Kamala Harris at the top of the list.","Biden is sitting down for an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos in course of campaign events in Wisconsin on Friday night.

ABC interview

A defiant US President Biden reassured supporters on Friday that he is staying in the race and expressed confidence that he will beat Donald Trump , come what may. Biden, who expects to put a strong front and recover from last week's disastrous debate performance, said he would ""get back up"" and not let the 90-minute debate overshadow his accomplishments of the last three and a half years.Ahead of the crucial interview, Biden in the key battleground state of Wisconsin said, ""You probably heard that I had a rough debate last week.Can't say it was my best performance, but since then, there's been a lot of speculation: 'What's Joe going to do? Is he going to stay in the race? Is he going to drop out?' Well, here's my answer: I am running and I am going to win again.""Biden said that he was going to defeat Donald Trump despite attempts being made to ""push him out"" of the race.President Biden, who made headlines more often than not for his gaffes over the past week, initially misspoke by saying he would beat Trump again in 2020, but then corrected himself, saying, ""We're going to do it again in 2024 .""""I learned long ago, when you get knocked down, you get back up,"" he said, emphasizing that he wouldn't let a 90-minute debate erase his accomplishments over the last three and a half years.In his speech, Biden mocked Trump's verbal gaffes, referencing an incident where Trump claimed Revolutionary War armies took over airports. Biden quipped, ""They talk about me misspeaking—airports and the British in 1776. It’s true, he is a stable genius.""Democratic allies are urging Biden to step up his campaign or drop out of the 2024 race, stressing on the need to demonstrate his readiness for a second term.Apart from the Texas Congressman, who became the first democrat to announce his reservation against Biden running again, Massachusetts Governor on Friday Maura Healey joined the clamor by issuing a statement urging President Joe Biden to “carefully evaluate” whether he remains the Democratic Party’s best hope to defeat Donald Trump in the 2024 election. Evaluations of Biden's fitness for office, including his upcoming speech and ABC interview, are expected to be closely scrutinized against a backdrop of growing clamor from outside and also within.In this context, Biden's ABC interview is expected to be both fair and challenging, focusing on his age and mental acuity. Potential missteps in this unscripted format could impact his reelection prospects, with some Democratic operatives critical of his decision to continue running. For Biden, the interview and the forthcoming campaigns will be key to setting the narrative right and more importantly rewriting the wrong from the debate that went awry.However, earlier on Thursday, Biden's campaign faced setbacks as he stumbled in a radio interview, mistakenly suggesting he was ""the first Black woman to serve with a Black president,"" confusing his tenure as vice president under Obama with Kamala Harris' role.At a separate event on Fourth of July celebrations, Biden stumbled through a brief speech at a White House barbecue, briefly claiming highway congestion was a thing of the past and nearly referring to Donald Trump as his ""colleague."" And quickly hushed it off by saying, “I probably shouldn’t even say that … anyway.”","US President Biden reassured supporters on Friday that he is staying in the race and expressed confidence that he will beat Donald Trump.

His campaign has cautioned external allies not to speak on his behalf, dismissing their transition efforts as unhelpful.Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, made provocative comments on Steve Bannon's podcast, referring to Republicans reclaiming the country, which the Biden campaign condemned as advocating for a violent revolution.“We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,” Roberts said.Those comments were widely circulated online and blasted by the Biden campaign, which issued a statement saying Trump and his allies were ""dreaming of a violent revolution to destroy the very idea of America.”Project 2025 involves former senior officials from the Trump administration, including Paul Dans, Russ Vought, and John McEntee, although a spokesperson stressed it is not tied to any specific candidate or campaign but rather to conservative policy recommendations.Biden's campaign has criticized Project 2025, arguing it would undermine democratic checks and consolidate power in the presidency if Trump were to win reelection.On Independence Day, as Biden prepared for a TV interview following a challenging debate, his campaign used imagery from ""The Handmaid's Tale"" to criticize what they see as authoritarian tendencies in Trump's camp.","Donald Trump on Friday distanced himself from Project 2025, a sweeping proposal for government overhaul.

Kelly expressed frustration that Biden seemed to be assuming a leadership role that she was not elected to, questioning her presence and influence at such events.“She’s not the damn president. Get out of the chair,” Kelly was quoted as telling.“No one wants you at the G7.

Because she’s power hungry. Because she has a small, fractured ego that she needs built up,” she said.“The only people who get to be called doctor, legitimately, I understand, no disparaging of the degree, are medical doctors.”Kelly also likened a video showing Jill Biden assisting President Joe Biden off the debate stage to a mother guiding a toddler, implying that Jill Biden was exerting a controlling influence over her husband's public appearances.“This is the leader of the free world.

US says troops are leaving Niger bases this weekend and in August after coup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-says-troops-are-leaving-niger-bases-this-weekend-and-in-august-after-coup/articleshow/111519831.cms,"WASHINGTON: The US will remove all its forces and equipment from a small base in Niger this weekend and fewer than 500 remaining troops will leave a critical drone base in the West African country in August, ahead of a September 15 deadline set in an agreement with the new ruling junta, the American commander there said Friday.Air Force Major General Kenneth Ekman said in an interview that a number of small teams of 10-20 US troops, including special operations forces, have moved to other countries in West Africa.But the bulk of the forces will go, at least initially, to Europe.Niger's ouster of American troops following a coup last year has broad ramifications for the US because it is forcing troops to abandon the critical drone base that was used for counterterrorism missions in the Sahel.Ekman and other US military leaders have said other West African nations want to work with the US and may be open to an expanded American presence. He did not detail the locations, but other US officials have pointed to the Ivory Coast and Ghana as examples.Ekman, who serves as the director for strategy at US Africa Command, is leading the US military withdrawal from the small base at the airport in Niger's capital of Niamey and from the larger counterterrorism base in the city of Agadez. He said there will be a ceremony Sunday marking the completed pullout from the airport base, then those final 100 troops and the last C-17 transport aircraft will depart.Speaking to reporters from The Associated Press and Reuters from the US embassy in Niamey, Ekman said that while portable buildings and vehicles that are no longer useful will be left behind, a lot of larger equipment will be pulled out. For example, he said 18 4,000-pound (1,800-kilograms) generators worth more than $1 million each will be taken out of Agadez.Unlike the withdrawal from Afghanistan, he said the US is not destroying equipment or facilities as it leaves.""Our goal in the execution is, leave things in as good a state as possible,"" he said. ""If we went out and left it a wreck or we went out spitefully, or if we destroyed things as we went, we'd be foreclosing options"" for future security relations.Niger's ruling junta ordered US forces out of the country in the wake of last July's ouster of the country's democratically elected president by mutinous soldiers. French forces had also been asked to leave as the junta turned to the Russian mercenary group Wagner for security assistance.Washington officially designated the military takeover as a coup in October, triggering US laws restricting the military support and aid.","Niger's ouster of American troops following a coup last year has broad ramifications for the US because it is forcing troops to abandon the critical drone base.

Growing pressure on Biden

As US President Joe Biden prepares to put up a brave front and convince his supporters in a TV interview with ABC on Friday evening (local time), former President Donald Trump has issued a new debate challenge, unlike the previous format, which the ex-president claimed would test Biden's competence . Trump, who got the better of Biden in their first debate, proposed a debate with no rules and no moderators .In a post on Truth Social on Thursday, Trump, 78, called for a “no holds barred” debate to let Biden, 81, prove his “competence or lack thereof.” He suggested a direct, unmoderated discussion, claiming it would ""blow everything away"" and attract higher ratings than their previous debate, which drew 47.9 million viewers.“I have the answer to the crooked Joe Biden incompetence puzzle. Let’s do another Debate, but this time, no holds barred,” Trump stated in his post.“An all-on discussion, with just the two of us on stage, talking about the future of our Country,” he added.The first debate, moderated by CNN's Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, limited responses to two minutes per answer and one minute for rebuttals, with microphones muted for overtime or interruptions. Trump argued his format would give Biden a chance to justify controversial policies on open borders, sports inclusion, electric vehicles, and inflation, suggesting this would test Biden's competence.During their first debate on June 27, Biden froze at one point and made confusing statements. The president later acknowledged his below-par performance, attributing his disorientation to extensive foreign travel and jet lag.Trump, riding high since then, claimed this format would allow Biden to explain the policies he has enacted during his first term, which Trump argues have been detrimental to the American people.“Let Joe explain why he wants open borders, with millions of people, and many violent criminals from parts unknown, pouring into our once great nation, or why he wants men playing in women’s sports,” Trump said.“Or demand all electric vehicles within five years, or why he allowed inflation to run rampant, destroying the people of our country, and so much more.“It would also, under great pressure, prove his ‘competence,’ or lack thereof,” Trump asserted, a dig at the growing calls for Biden to drop out of the race following his poor performance in the first debate.After his debate fiasco, Biden has faced criticism not only from his opponents but also from lawmakers within his own party. Some Democratic lawmakers have publicly urged Biden to step down, with a notable call coming from a Democratic lawmaker from Texas.Facing mounting pressure, Biden convened Democratic governors at the White House on Wednesday to rally support. However, his remarks about needing more rest and fewer late events, aligning with earlier claims that he operates best between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., have further drawn criticism, reminiscent of his comment about ""almost falling asleep"" on debate night due to extensive travel.Trump's debate proposal also coincides with several gaffes Biden made during his Fourth of July speech. Trump expressed enthusiasm for a straightforward debate, claiming it would test both candidates. A second debate is already scheduled for September 10, with Biden committed to participating.In a leaked video, Trump was seen discussing Biden's possible withdrawal from the race, referring to him as a “broken-down pile of crap,” while sitting in a golf cart with his son, Barron.Although the president and the White House have dismissed any reports of Biden withdrawing from the race, the second debate agreed upon by both campaigns and scheduled for September 10 will be keenly watched to see what unfolds going forward.","Former President Donald Trump has called for a direct, unmoderated debate with no rules and no moderators.

Imran Khan to go on hunger strike over lack of confidence in chief justice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-to-go-on-hunger-strike-over-lack-of-confidence-in-chief-justice/articleshow/111522851.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s jailed former prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to go on hunger strike over his lack of confidence in the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Justice Qazi Faez Isa , and if the ill-treatment meted out to him in prison continues, said Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) politicians who met him in Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Friday.Speaking to media after meeting Khan, the PTI politicians warned that if the injustice continues the party's founder will go on hunger strike.“If the party’s founder goes on a hunger strike in jail, it will trigger a nationwide hunger strike,” said Shamim Naqvi, a PTI politician from Karachi.Imran cited ongoing concerns over Justice Isa’s involvement in benches handling PTI cases and his personal cases. He emphasised the concerns expressed by his legal team about the CJ’s infrequent attendance, reflecting a growing sentiment in his camp that justice might not be administered fairly in these circumstances.Imran also expressed disappointment over a cancelled meeting with his legal and political teams. The superintendent, allegedly at the request of a jailed colonel, denied Khan’s team access, citing operational reasons.“They (Pakistan’s powerful military authorities) are mistaken; they think my party will weaken. They don't realize that the party with the strongest voter base remains strong,” Imran said while asserting his party’s resilience.He emphasised that the IMF cannot solve the country’s issues and that the solution lies in fair and transparent elections. “The entire nation states that the biggest fraud (Feb 2024 national and provincial polls) occurred, yet the chief justice is defending the election commission. The electoral watchdog has committed the greatest fraud in the country. We are seeking justice. If investigations proceed, the chief election commissioner will face Article 6 (guilty of high treason).”“I will never succumb to the tyranny of time; I am prepared to die in jail. As long as I live, I will wage this battle,” Imran remarked.About national security, he highlighted the necessity of a strong relationship with Afghanistan. “Why did Bilawal Bhutto and our foreign minister not visit Afghanistan? Without support from the Afghan govt, we cannot win this war (against TTP) across a 2,500-km-long border,” he added.","Imran cites ongoing concerns over Justice Isa’s involvement in benches handling PTI cases and his personal cases.
