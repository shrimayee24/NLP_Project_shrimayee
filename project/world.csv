Meanwhile, two bars which had allegedly served liquor to the minor were also sealed.Talking about the initial procedure in this case, the deputy chief minister said that the punishment given to the 17-year-old who was driving the Porshe under the influence of alcohol was ""lenient"". The Juvenile Justice Board had asked the teen to write 300-word essay on accidents and to work with the traffic police for 15 days . He was also ordered to undergo counselling.""According to the application moved by the police, it was written that the boy's age was 17 years and 8 months. This is a heinous crime. After the Nirbhaya case, the changes in the Juvenile Justice case - that if the accused is above 16 years of age and the crime is heinous, the accused can be treated as an adult ... This was a surprising order passed (by the Juvenile Justice Board) ... Police went to the higher court & they took cognisance,"" Fadnavis said.Earlier in the day, the Pune Police arrested the the father of the teen who is a prominent city realtor. Vishal Agarwal was absconding for the past two days after his son knocked down two IT professionals from Madhya Pradesh early on Sunday morning in an alleged case of underage, drunken driving in an unregistered vehicle, sparking a furore in Pune.A separate case was filed against the father and the two owners, a manager and a bartender of two pubs he had visited.

While flamingo deaths have gone up in the past few weeks, this is the first time that the birds have been involved in an accident involving an aircraft.Emirates flight EK 508 was on its last leg of approach to land at city's main runway around 8.30 pm when the accident occurred.""The pilots informed us that during the post landing inspection of the aircraft, multiple bird strikes were observed on the aircraft fuselage. The pilots had reported about the bird strike after landing and parking at the bay,"" said a source from the Mumbai air traffic control. ""Assuming that the aircraft would have hit the birds during the final phase of landing, before touch down, we sent a team to inspect the runway for bird carcass, but we didn't find any,"" he added.Much before the air traffic control could begun the runway inspection, the residents of Laxmi Nagar, Ghatkopar had found themselves dealing with the accident. ""The locality was littered with bird carcass. Broken pieces of wings, beaks, claws were scattered over a large area,"" said B N Kumar, director, NatConnect Foundation, an NGO devoted to environmental issues. The forest department was informed and they collected most of the carcass at night, he said, adding that at least 40 birds have been killed in the accident. The birds were flying towards Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary (TCFS), the only urban Ramsar site in the country, when the flight paths crossed.Though most of the carcass was cleared, early morning joggers came across remains of birds in some parts of the locality leading to much distress among residents, said a Ghatkopar resident.""It is absolutely shocking as an avian tragedy of this scale has never happened in Mumbai. Flamingos have been seen changing their flight paths due to massive construction projects such as Atal Setu. The birds are also disoriented due to light pollution, a major concern in cities such as Mumbai. The accident calls for a major investigation,"" he added.A statement from Emirates is awaited.A number of flamingo deaths have been reported from Mumbai in the past few months.In the last week of April, 12 injured flamingos were found in wetlands near Seawoods, in Navi Mumbai. Out of these over five birds died during treatment. Prior to that a flamingo was hit by a speeding vehicle on Palm Beach road. In February, three flamingos flew into a hoarding and crashed and died. The billboard was removed by CIDCO following the accident.",Emirates flight EK 508 was on its last leg of approach to land at city's main runway when the accident occurred.

Pakistan ne choodiyan nahi pehni hain, are bhai pehna denge. Ab unko aata bhi chahiye, unke pass bijli bhi nahi hai, ab humein maloom nahi ki unke pass choodiyan bhi nahi hai

NEW YORK: In perhaps the first acknowledgement of its kind on a global forum that the ""new India is a dangerous entity"", Pakistan 's Permanent Ambassador to the United Nations, Munir Akram said, invoking the alleged targeted and extra-judicial assassinations in his homeland and elsewhere.Pakistan's permanent representative at the world body also quoted from a report in a leading US daily to say the ""new India comes into your home and kills you"".Addressing the General Assembly on May 2, Akram said, ""Pakistan's foreign minister informed the Security Council, as well as the secretary general and the president of the General Assembly of India's campaign of targeted assassinations in Pakistan. This extra-territorial state terrorism is not limited to Pakistan. It has been extended to targeted killings of political opponents in Canada and attempted in the United States and probably in other countries.""""The Washington Post reported that Prime Minister Modi last week told his cheering supporters, and I quote, ""Today, even India's enemies know this is Modi. This is the new India. This new India comes into your home and kills you"". This new India is a dangerous entity, it is a net provider of insecurity, not security,"" Pakistan's permanent representative to the UN alleged.Earlier, top British daily, The Guardian, claimed in a report that the Indian government carried out assassinations of wanted individuals deep inside Pakistan as part of a ""wider strategy to eliminate terrorists living on foreign soil"".It said, citing intelligence sources, that targeted assassinations increased significantly in 2023, claiming India's involvement in the suspected deaths of about 15 people, ""most of whom were shot at close range by unknown gunmen"".Earlier, some countries in the West raised concerns over what they claimed were targeted killings on their soil at the behest of the Indian government.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused 'agents' allegedly in the employ of the Indian government of killing Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a pro-Khalistan leader and a designated terrorist by the country's elite National Investigation Agency (NIA), in 2020.However, India has dismissed the claim as 'absurd' and 'motivated'.Nijjar was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year. A purported video clip of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March, this year, showing Nijjar being shot by armed men in what was alleged to be a 'contract killing'.In a recent development in the Nijjar case, the Canadian Police arrested four Indian nationals for their alleged involvement in the killing of the separatist Khalistleader outside a gurudwara in British Columbia last June.Reacting to the arrests, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar denied receiving any evidence implicating Indian nationals' involvement in the killing in Canada of the India-designated terrorist.Responding to media queries, Jaishankar said, ""I also read that another arrest has been made. If that person is an Indian national, then usually by consular practice, you inform the government or the embassy of the country of origin. But beyond that, we have long maintained that if anything, any event in Canada, any violence in Canada, has any evidence or information which is relevant to be investigated in India, we are open to investigating it.""He emphasised that while any Indian national's arrest would usually prompt notification to the government or embassy, no specific evidence justifying investigation by Indian agencies has been received to date.""But to date, we have never received anything, which is specific and worthy of being pursued by our investigative agencies. And I'm not aware anything has changed in the last few days in that regard,"" the External Affairs Minister said at a media interaction at a seminar on Indian Capital Markets 'Roadmap for Viksit Bharat' at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in Mumbai earlier.At a weekly media briefing, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), too, informed that Canada had not formally conveyed the arrests and India had not yet received any consular access request.On being asked about the fourth Indian arrested by Canada in connection with the Nijjar killing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""We have seen reports of the fourth person being arrested. We have not been formally conveyed of it. So far, we have not received any consular access request as well.""Earlier, campaigning for the ongoing general elections in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a telling remark vis-a-vis its western neighbour, saying India does not send dossiers on terrorism anymore but eliminates terrorists in their own backyard.""Today, India doesn't send dossiers.(Today India strikes back at terrorists on their own turf),"" PM Modi said at a poll rally in Maharashtra's Latur.Expanding on the difference in how his government tackles terrorism as compared to previous Congress regimes at the Centre, Prime Minister Modi said the earlier approach of handing dossiers to Pakistan has been replaced by taking out the wanted terror conspirators on their own turf.At a separate rally, PM Modi doubled down on remarks made by the INDIA bloc leader Farooq Abdullah that Pakistan was not wearing bangles and was a nuclear-amed nation, saying, """" (I was told Pakistanis don't even have bangles, we will make them wear some)"".Addressing a public meeting in Muzaffarpur, PM Modi said, ""These (Congress and INDIA alliance) people are so afraid that they see Pakistan's atom bombs even in their dreams. Can such a government and leader run the country? They (INDI alliance leaders) say, ''. (i am told Pakistanis don't even have bangles...we will make them wear some. They are desperately crying out for wheat, they don't have electricity and now they don't even have bangles to wear.) Some leaders in the Opposition are even giving clean chits to the 26/11 accused.""""Some people are doubting the surgical strikes and air strikes (after the Uri and Pulwama terror attacks). These leaders want to weaken the morale of our forces and cast aspersions on our nuclear power. It seems like 'INDI alliance ne India ke khilaf supari le li hai' (INDI partners have taken out a contract against the country),"" PM Modi added.In the US, federal prosecutors earlier alleged the involvement of two Indian nationals, including a government employee, in a plot to murder Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Canadian also holding American citizenship, on its soil.According to the indictment of the US Justice Department, an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, who is currently in custody, was charged with the murder-for-hire of Pannun. The US Justice Department claimed that an Indian government employee, who was not identified in the indictment filed, recruited Gupta to hire a hitman to allegedly assassinate Pannun, which was foiled by US authorities.India set up a high-level committee to probe the matter.","Pakistan's Permanent Ambassador to the United Nations, Munir Akram said, invoking the alleged targeted and extra-judicial assassinations in his homeland and elsewhere.

A few dead birds dangled from electric wires above. Some others lay on the roads, while some broke through concrete roofs.Dipali Lokhande, of Pant Nagar, said she heard a loud thud around 8.30pm. ""We found a mutilated bird had crashed through the corrugated asbestos roof, leaving a gaping hole,"" said Lokhande, who added that police and fire brigade personnel helped them clear the carcass.There was chaos down the street, said Pritesh Modi, a rescuer from NGO Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare who was part of the search-and-rescue operation that started in the dark.Forest department said the flamingo toll stood at 39. Kirit Somaiya, former MP who visited the site, said one more carcass was found far away and so, the count is 40.In a statement, Emirates said it is cooperating with the authorities and its aircraft was damaged. ""...as a result, the return flight EK509 scheduled to depart to Dubai on 20 May was cancelled. All passengers and crew were accommodated overnight, and a replacement aircraft is being arranged for all passengers, local time."" No statement was issued by DGCA and Airports Authority of India.An official from Mumbai ATC said Emirates pilots reported the bird strike after parking the aircraft at the bay. ""During post landing inspection, pilots found multiple bird strikes all over the fuselage... Assuming the aircraft would have hit the birds just before touchdown, we sent a team to inspect the runway for bird carcass, but we didn't find any,"" he added.Pilots pointed out that the accident occurred when the aircraft was just over 1 minute from touchdown.

EAM Jaishankar mocks Rahul's secret meets with Chinese envoys,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eam-jaishankar-mocks-rahuls-secret-meets-with-chinese-envoys/articleshow/110313093.cms,"NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday took a swipe at Rahul Gandhi over his meetings with Chinese envoys and said the Congress functionary must be having ""extra understanding"" about the neighbouring country as he had secret meetings with them.In an interview with Times Now, the minister said, ""Rahul understands China so much that he holds secret meetings with the Chinese envoy.He must have some extra understanding in these meetings."" He was responding to Rahul's remark that Jaishankar had no understanding of bilateral issues with China.While initially Congress didn't confirm the meeting, the Chinese embassy had released a photo of Rahul with their envoy.In the interview, the minister confirmed the buzz that PM Narendra Modi had indeed got Russian President Vladimir Putin to get the Russian army to stop shelling in order to facilitate the evacuation of Indian students .""Firstly, it was done on March 5 in Kharkiv. Our students were on their way to the nearest safe zone. Heavy shelling was taking place. Our prime minister called President Putin and asked him to stop the shelling to make way for our students. Upon the PM's request, the Russian army stopped the shelling and our students could reach the safe zone. Another crucial incident took place on March 8,"" he said.Jaishankar said in the last 10 years, as far as India's image and standing in the world was concerned, the country has touched new heights. ""There are many reasons, not just one. One reason is that every nation is known by the image of its leader. We are lucky that Modi has been very active in speaking about the India story across the world, and that has benefited us a lot,"" he said.He said since the formation of the Modi govt, the western media had been very critical of it. ""They questioned our Covid handling, economic handling and pharmaceutical industry. I am not saying we are always right, but the western media has always tried to set a narrative and give an opposing viewpoint. They questioned our methods, our election process and the weather during elections. The west has this old habit of commenting on growing countries. Why do they have such habits? These countries used to dominate the global political fray. Times have changed, but they have not,"" the minister said.Jaishankar said the Congress govt's mistakes in dealing with Beijing had resulted in China attacking and occupying Indian territory in 1962. ""When Nehru was making his China policy, he was opposed by Sardar Patel. Many ministers in the Nehru cabinet opposed him. Later, when Aksai Chin road was made, there were fiery discussions in Parliament. Several discussions took place on Nehru's foreign policy,"" the minister said, dismissing the suggestion that the 1962 attack could not have been anticipated.","S Jaishankar says Rahul Gandhi must be having ""extra understanding"" about the neighbouring country as he had secret meetings with them.

He added that temperatures could reach up to 6 degrees Celsius (10.8 Fahrenheit) above the monthly average. This week could rise above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in many parts of the country, Babar said.It's the latest climate-related disaster to hit the country in recent years. Melting glaciers and growing monsoons have caused devastating floods, at one point submerging a third of the country.Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961, with more than double the usual monthly rainfall, according to the national weather center. Last month's heavy rains killed scores of people while destroyed property and farmland, experts say the country witnessed heavier rains because of climate change .Pakistan is still trying to recover from $30 billion in losses caused by devastating climate-induced floods that killed 1,739 people in 2022.According to health officials, hospitals were instructed to set up emergency heatwave response centers so that those affected by the scorching temperatures could be quickly treated.Doctors say heatstroke is a serious illness that occurs when one's body temperature rises quickly because of sweltering heat, potentially causing some to fall unconscious. A severe heatstroke can cause disability or death.Some areas in Pakistan are also currently facing hours-long power outages.""We were without electricity for hours on Monday,"" said Ibrar Abbasi, who lives on the outskirts of Islamabad.Scientists have long warned that climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and certain agricultural practices, will lead to more frequent and prolonged bouts of extreme weather, including hotter temperatures.Babar said another intense heat wave will hit the country in June, when the temperature is likely to reach 45 degrees (113 Fahrenheit). He said people should drink a lot of water and avoid unnecessary travel. Farmers and other livestock owners should take measures to protect their animals during extreme heat, he said.However, many people, especially laborers and construction workers in the impoverished nation, ask how they can stay indoors as their families will suffer if they don't work.""I am not feeling well because of the stifling heat, but I have to work,"" said Ghulam Farid, who owns a small general store in Sheikhupra, a city in Punjab province.Construction workers were seen sitting near a road on the outskirts of the capital, Islamabad, hoping to get a job.

NEW DELHI: The International Criminal Court (ICC) is pursuing arrest warrants for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Israel's defense minister Yoav Gallant, and two other top Hamas leaders, Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri (also known as Mohammed Deif) and Ismail Haniyeh, according to a statement released by ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan on Monday.The charges are related to the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza, which Khan alleges constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity .The charges against Sinwar, Haniyeh, and al-Masri include ""extermination, murder, taking of hostages, rape and sexual assault in detention"", while the charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include ""causing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict,"" said Khan in his statement.The ICC's decision to target Netanyahu marks the first time the court has sought an arrest warrant for the top leader of a close US ally, placing him in the same category as Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is also facing an ICC arrest warrant over the war in Ukraine.A panel of ICC judges will now consider Khan's application for the arrest warrants.Israel's top leaders slammed the development as a ""historical disgrace"".A furious Netanyahu lashed out at the ICC and the prosecutor, stating that the ""absurd"" move was ""exactly what new anti-Semitism looks like"".Vowing to bring down Hamas and achieve total victory, Netanyahu said Israel was fighting a ""just war"".Israel's foreign minister Israel Katz also hit out at the ICC chief prosecutor, stating: ""The Attorney General in the same breath mentions the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence of the State of Israel alongside the abominable Nazi monsters of Hamas -- a historical disgrace that will be remembered forever.""Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz slammed the move which he said draws ""parallels between the leaders of a democratic country determined to defend itself from despicable terror to leaders of a blood-thirsty terror organisation (Hamas)"". ""It is a deep distortion of justice and blatant moral bankruptcy,"" he added.Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri also panned the ICC prosecutor's move, stating that the decision ""equates the victim with the executioner"" and encourages Israel to continue its ""war of extermination"" in Gaza.Wasel Abu Youssef, member of the Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee, said: ""The Palestinian people have the right to defend themselves ... The ICC is required to issue arrest warrants against Israeli officials who are pursuing crimes of genocide in the Gaza Strip.""When reports of the potential ICC action surfaced last month, Netanyahu called it ""an outrage of historic proportions"" and asserted that Israel has an independent legal system that thoroughly investigates all violations of the law. In response to Netanyahu's comments, Khan stated, ""Nobody is above the law,"" and advised Israel to raise a challenge before the court's judges if they disagree with the ICC's jurisdiction.Although Israel and the US are not members of the ICC, the court claims jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court's founding principles in 2015.The US also slammed the ICC prosecutor's move, stating that such a ""shameful"" decision puts ""truce talks at risk"".""We reject the prosecutor's equivalence of Israel with Hamas ...

NEW DELHI: Mohammad Mokhber who was Iran's first vice president, has been appointed as the interim president following Mohammad Raisi's death in a chopper crash on May 19. Born on September 1, 1955, in Dezful, Khuzestan Province, he has a background in business administration and management. Known for his close ties to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei , Mokhber assumed the role of first vice president in 2021 following Ebrahim Raisi 's election as president.In his capacity as interim president, Mokhber is part of a three-person council, along with the Speaker of Parliament and the head of the judiciary, responsible for organizing a new presidential election within 50 days if the president dies.Mokhber held several significant positions in Iran's economic and industrial sectors, notably serving as the head of Setad, an investment fund linked to the Supreme Leader. Setad, officially the Headquarters for Executing the Order of the Imam, was established by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to manage and sell properties abandoned after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, with proceeds primarily directed to charity.Mokhber was also involved in international dealings and was part of a delegation that visited Moscow in October, agreeing to supply surface-to-surface missiles and drones to Russia's military. This delegation included senior officials from Iran's Revolutionary Guards and an official from the Supreme National Security Council.His activities have led to international scrutiny. In 2010, the European Union sanctioned Mokhber for alleged involvement in nuclear or ballistic missile activities, though he was removed from the list two years later. In 2013, the US Treasury Department sanctioned Setad and 37 associated companies.Mokhber was previously the head of Setad, an investment fund linked to the Supreme Leader.

Throughout the hearing, protesters repeatedly interrupted Blinken, accusing him of being a war criminal and responsible for a genocide against the Palestinian people.Blinken condemned the ICC prosecutor's move to seek arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, stating that the tribunal lacks jurisdiction and that equating Israeli officials with Hamas leaders was 'extremely wrong-headed.' He assured senators that the administration would work with them to formulate an appropriate response if necessary.The Secretary of State also addressed the administration's condolences for the deaths of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and others in a helicopter crash, clarifying that such gestures are typical when 'countries - adversaries, enemies or not - have lost leaders.' He emphasised that this did not change the administration's stance on Raisi's rreprehensible conduct' as a judge and President.Meanwhile, Brett McGurk, a top Middle East adviser to President Biden, engaged in indirect talks with Iran's acting foreign minister, Ali Bagheri Kani, in Oman last week.

While his core conservative supporters want tougher restrictions, sweeping bans on the procedure have typically been rejected by voters at the ballot box.In March he suggested he would favor a national abortion ban after 15 or 16 weeks of pregnancy, but later backtracked to say such decisions should be left up to the states, of which 21 have total or partial abortion bans in place.Trump told Time magazine in April that he had ""pretty strong views"" on women's access to mifepristone, a medication used for abortions, and would share his views on it within a week, but never did so.The Supreme Court's 2022 ruling has cost Republicans politically.

Columbus is about 87 miles (140 kilometers) west of Omaha.Iowa was in the storms ' crosshairs, with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center giving most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes later in the afternoon and into the evening.

Trump's lawyers rest case in hush money trial without calling him to testify,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-lawyers-rest-case-in-hush-money-trial-without-calling-him-to-testify/articleshow/110309376.cms,"NEW YORK: Donald Trump 's defense team rested its case in the criminal hush money trial on Tuesday without calling the former U.S. president to testify .Trump's lawyers called two witnesses in his defense. Justice Juan Merchan said jurors would return next Tuesday to hear closing arguments, with deliberations likely beginning the following day.Trump's lawyers had asked Merchan to dismiss the case before it reaches the jury, arguing that it rests on the testimony of a witness, the estranged former Trump fixer Michael Cohen, who has a well-documented history of lying.Such dismissal motions are rarely successful, and Merchan indicated on Monday that he was inclined to let jurors assess Cohen's credibility for themselves. Prosecutors say his testimony is buttressed by other evidence.Cohen, the prosecution's final witness, wrapped up his testimony on Monday, clearing the way for Trump's lawyers to present witnesses and their own evidence.Lawyer Robert Costello, the second witness called by Trump's defense, testified on Monday that Cohen told him he did not have any incriminating information on Trump.Costello's demeanor on the witness stand apparently angered Merchan on Monday, who cleared the courtroom to tell him, ""Don't roll your eyes."" Costello resumed testifying on Tuesday before the defense rested its case.Trump is accused of covering up a $130,000 payment that bought the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels, who in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential election was peddling her story of a sexual encounter with Trump.Though the hush-money payment itself is not illegal, Trump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records to hide his reimbursement to Cohen, who initially paid for the transaction.Trump, 77, has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing. He says he never had sex with Daniels and has cast the trial as a politically motivated attempt to hurt his effort to win back the White House as a Republican from Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election.Cohen testified that he spoke repeatedly with Trump about the payment to Daniels in the final stretch of the 2016 presidential campaign when Trump was facing multiple accusations of sexual misconduct.Cohen said Trump worried that Daniels would hurt his appeal to women voters if she went public with her story. Trump's legal team says he made the payment to protect his family from embarrassment.Cohen admitted on the witness stand on Monday that he had stolen money from Trump's business, saying he was angry his bonus was cut after he handled the Daniels payment.","Donald Trump's defense team rested its case in the criminal hush money trial on Tuesday without calling the former U.S. president to testify.

Defense witness who angered the judge in Trump's hush money trial will return to the stand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/defense-witness-who-angered-the-judge-in-trumps-hush-money-trial-will-return-to-the-stand/articleshow/110308390.cms,"NEW YORK: A defense witness in Donald Trump 's hush money case whom the judge threatened to remove from the trial over his behavior will return to the stand Tuesday as the trial nears its end.Trump's lawyers are hoping Robert Costello 's testimony will help undermine the credibility of a key prosecution witness , Trump fixer-turned-foe Michael Cohen .""They have no case,"" Trump said outside the courtroom Tuesday. ""There's no crime.""But Costello angered Judge Juan Merchan on Monday by making comments under his breath, rolling his eyes and calling the whole exercise ""ridiculous,"" prompting the judge to briefly kick reporters out of the courtroom to admonish him.The judge told Costello, a former federal prosecutor, he was being ""contemptuous,"" adding, ""If you try to stare me down one more time, I will remove you from the stand,"" according to a court transcript.Costello didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Monday from The Associated Press.The chaotic scene unfolded after prosecutors rested their case accusing Trump of falsifying business records as part of a scheme to bury stories that he feared could hurt his 2016 campaign. Thecriminal trial , the first of a former US president, is in the final stretch, with closing arguments expected the Tuesday after Memorial Day.The charges stem from internal Trump Organization records in which payments to Cohen were marked as legal expenses. Prosecutors say they were really reimbursements for a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels to keep her from going public before the 2016 election with claims of a sexual encounter with Trump. Trump says nothing sexual happened between them.Trump has said he did nothing illegal and has slammed the case as an effort to hinder his 2024 bid to reclaim the White House. Trump, a Republican, called the judge a ""tyrant"" in remarks to reporters while leaving the courthouse Monday and called the trial a ""disaster"" for the country.After jurors left for the day Monday, defense attorneys pressed the judge to throw out the charges before jurors even begin deliberating, arguing prosecutors have failed to prove their case. The defense has suggested that Trump was trying to protect his family, not his campaign, by squelching what he says were false, scurrilous claims.Defense attorney Todd Blanche argued that there was nothing illegal about soliciting a tabloid's help to run positive stories about Trump, run negative stories about his opponents and identify potentially damaging stories before they were published. No one involved ""had any criminal intent,"" Blanche said.""How is keeping a false story from the voters criminal?"" Blanche asked.Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo shot back that ""the trial evidence overwhelmingly supports each element"" of the alleged offenses and said the case should proceed to the jury.The judge didn't immediately rule on the defense's request. Such long-shot requests are often made in criminal cases but are rarely granted.The defense called Costello because of his role as an antagonist to Cohen since their professional relationship splintered in spectacular fashion. Costello had offered to represent Cohen soon after the lawyer's hotel room, office and home were raided and as Cohen faced a decision about whether to remain defiant in the face of a criminal investigation or to cooperate with authorities in hopes of securing more lenient treatment.Costello in the years since has repeatedly maligned Cohen's credibility and was even a witness before last year's grand jury that indicted Trump, offering testimony designed to undermine Cohen's account. In a Fox News Channel interview last week, Costello accused Cohen of lying to the jury and using the case to ""monetize"" himself.Costello contradicted Cohen's testimony describing Trump as intimately involved in all aspects of the hush money scheme. Costello told jurors Monday that Cohen told him Trump ""knew nothing"" about the hush money payment to Daniels.""Michael Cohen said numerous times that President Trump knew nothing about those payments, that he did this on his own, and he repeated that numerous times,"" Costello testified.Cohen, however, testified earlier Monday that he has ""no doubt"" that Trump gave him a final sign-off to make the payments to Daniels. In total, he said he spoke with Trump more than 20 times about the matter in October 2016.Trump lawyer Emil Bove told the judge that the defense does not plan to call any other witnesses after Costello, though it may still call campaign finance expert Bradley A. Smith for limited testimony. It has not said definitively that Trump won't testify, but that's the clearest indication yet that he will waive his right to take the stand in his own defense.","Robert Costello angered Judge Juan Merchan on Monday by making comments under his breath, rolling his eyes and calling the whole exercise ""ridiculous"" The judge told Costello, a former federal prosecutor, he was being ""contemptuous,"" adding, ""If you try to stare me down one more time, I will remove you from the stand,"" according to a court transcript.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110308579,imgsize-1305656,width-400,resizemode-4/110308579.jpg"

Video posted online showed police at times using what appeared to be an irritant to spray people, who were forced to retreat.The encampment had been set up in late April near the end of the school year and as families arrived for spring commencement. Posters taunting President Santa Ono and other officials were also displayed.After the camp was cleared, nearby buildings, including the undergraduate and graduate libraries, were closed, and police turned away students who showed up to study.Ono said in a statement that the encampment had become a threat to safety, with overloaded power sources and open flames. Organizers, he added, had refused to comply with requests to make changes following an inspection by a fire marshal.""The disregard for safety directives was only the latest in a series of troubling events centered on an encampment that has always violated the rules that govern the Diag - especially the rules that ensure the space is available to everyone,"" Ono said.Protesters have demanded that the school's endowment stop investing in companies with ties to Israel .

The alliance stated that Islamabad High Court (IHC) had already granted permission for the gathering.According to ARY News, the applicants stated that the public gathering initially planned for March was postponed due to the last days of Ramadan.Previously, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) granted permission for a public gathering following a petition by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). Chief Justice of the IHC, Justice Aamer Farooq, presided over the hearing.PTI district president Aamir Mughal approached the IHC through his counsel and PTI leader Sher Afzal Marwat.

Coated head to toe in eye-catching gold paint, they stood perfectly still, leaning on glimmering canes and tipping their top hats open. Perhaps in a different place, the emergence of mimes on the street looking to earn a few dollars might go unnoticed.But this is Pakistan , where things under the security state often are not as simple as they seem. So as the number of golden performers grew, so, too, did the intrigue around them. Could they be informants for the nation's intelligence agency? Lookouts for powerful politicians? Maybe spies for CIA ?Today, the ""golden men"" of Islamabad have been added to the ranks of the conspiracy theories sprouted, knocked down and rehashed every day across the city. In Pakistan, where the hand of the security services is seen everywhere, conspiracy theories have been embraced in the mainstream for decades. Suspicion has become so universal that wild tales take root after almost every news event. In the wake of catastrophic floods in 2010, people asserted that they had been caused by CIA weather-controlling technology. Media pundits claimed that a US ""thinktank"" was behind a failed car bombing by a Pakistani-American in Times Square that year and that Osama bin Laden was actually Jewish.In such a climate, everyone - even street performers - can be seen as potential tools of the state. For most of Pakistan's 76-year history, the surveillance was a routine facet of daily life. But in recent years, frustration with the military's role in politics has exploded. ""With the political atmosphere so polarised, we're becoming more suspicious of being watched or who is listening,"" said Ali Abas, 25, a resident of Islamabad.On the other side of the city, Mustaq Ahmed, 53, stood on a median of a busy intersection. His jacket, pants, walking cane and top hat were all spray-painted gold. Gold makeup was caked onto his face and hand. Ahmed once sold umbrellas, but became ""Golden Thakur"" three years ago after he overheard another golden man saying he made up to Pak Rs 8,000 - or nearly $30 - each day. It was more than five times what Ahmed was taking home. That cash has dwindled recently as the novelty of the golden men has waned, he said. When asked if he would ever supplement his income with a little side work for the intelligence agencies, he immediately replied: ""no, no, no."" Was there any chance that other golden men were earning a few extra dollars that way? ""Maybe,"" he said with a shrug. ""It's Pakistan.""","In Pakistan, where the hand of the security services is seen everywhere, conspiracy theories have been embraced in the mainstream for decades.

The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) launched an inquiry against the 71-year-old Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi over the alleged misuse of the Toshakhana -- the state gift repository, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.The beleaguered former first couple has been convicted in earlier Toshakhana corruption cases as well.In January, Khan and Bushra were sentenced to 14 years in jail each by an accountability court for alleged corruption in state gifts they got from the state repository. The sentence was later suspended by the Islamabad High Court (IHC). The previous Toshakhana graft case was filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in the charges of hiring the sale of state gifts.The NAB investigation centres on the illegal possession and sale of seven high-value watches and 10 other precious gifts, including diamond and gold jewellery, the report said.According to the inquiry, items such as Graff and Rolex watches and diamond jewellery were allegedly sold without being legally owned or deposited in the Toshakhana, as required by law.The Toshakhana is a department under the Cabinet Division that stores gifts given to rulers and government officials by heads of other governments and foreign dignitaries.Under the rules governing Toshakhana - a Persian word meaning ""treasure house"" - government officials can keep gifts by paying a price, but first, the gift should be deposited.The gifts were purchased/retained at ""considerably lower rates"" and were ""routinely sold"" without properly declaring them. The expensive Graff watch set was also allegedly sold without ""retention"", according to the report.The NAB's findings suggest collusion between the buyers of the Graff watches and a private appraiser, who allegedly undervalued the watches by Rs 30 million.The undervaluation, confirmed via an email from Toshakhana, meant that only Rs 20.1 million, or 20 per cent of the watches' actual value of Rs 100.9 million, was deposited into the government treasury, the report said.""During the course of the inquiry, it was revealed that the value of luxury gift items was assessed in an unscrupulous and slipshod manner by a private appraiser [...] was not even an industry expert and did not possess the required experience or expertise to make these assessments,"" Geo News said, citing the report.After the report findings, the accountability watchdog was authorised to conduct further probes against Khan and Bushra. Separate call-up notices had also been served to them, which they have challenged in the IHC.The court will hear Bushra's appeal on June 4 and Khan's appeal on June 24, the report said.The former-cricketer-turned-politician has been lodged at the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi since August last year. Since his removal from power in a no-confidence motion in April 2022, Khan has been convicted in at least four cases, including the cipher (secret diplomatic communication) case.","Pakistan's accountability watchdog accuses Imran Khan of ""illegally"" possessing and selling seven high-value watches and 10 other precious gifts.

The upcoming election in Sri Lanka will have a major impact on the future of the island nation and human rights considerations for years to come, the global rights NGO said in a statement issued at the end of a five-day visit by its Secretary General Agnes Callamard to the country.The presidential election in Sri Lanka is scheduled to take place between mid-September and mid-October.""The visit has provided insights into many challenges that Sri Lanka is confronting 15 years after the end of the war (with the LTTE ),"" the statement said.Callamard visited the northeastern Mullaithvu district on Sunday to commemorate the fallen victims from the Tamil side to mark the 15th anniversary of the end of the final conflict.""A seemingly lack of political will, along with complacency in delivering justice prevents reconciliation,"" the statement said, calling on the international community to work with the island's authorities to secure truth and justice for all victims of the war and the ongoing human rights violations and lay the foundation for a freer and fairer Sri Lanka.Amnesty said during the visit, the focus had been centred on threats to civil society; freedom of expression; the right to peaceful protest; the use of anti-terror laws such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to suppress dissent; harassment; intimidation; surveillance and obstacles to press freedom.It said the new legislation such as the Online Security Act and the proposed non-governmental organisation law are worrying evidence of the dangers faced by civil society in the country.The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) had run a military campaign for a separate Tamil homeland in the northern and eastern provinces of the island nation for nearly 30 years before its collapse in 2009.On May 18, 2009, the Sri Lankan Army declared victory with the discovery of the body of the dreaded LTTE leader Velupillai Prabakaran .Despite the passage of nearly 15 years since the end of the armed conflict and many decades since the earliest waves of enforced disappearances, Sri Lankan authorities are still failing to ensure accountability for these violations. Tamil groups claimed a large number of civilians had perished during the final battle.A report issued by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ( OHCHR ) on Friday said the Sri Lankan government must take meaningful action to determine and disclose the fates and whereabouts of tens of thousands of people who have been subjected to enforced disappearance over the decades and hold those responsible to account.It called for renewed action by Sri Lanka at the domestic level to hold it to account through criminal justice. The report also called for the international community to be engaged with Sri Lanka for investigation and prosecutions for targeted sanctions.Sri Lanka maintains that OHCHR is not mandated by the member states to issue any such report.","There is seemingly a ""lack of political will"" in delivering justice to the many victims of Sri Lanka's three-decade-long internal armed conflict, Amnesty International says.

A powerful armed ethnic group in Myanmar said on Sunday it had won control over a town in the western state of Rakhine after weeks of fighting, denying accusations it had targeted members of the Muslim-minority Rohingya during the offensive.Khine Thu Kha, a spokesman for the Arakan Army (AA), said its soldiers had taken Buthidaung near Myanmar's border with Bangladesh, marking another battlefield defeat for the ruling junta that is fighting opposition groups on multiple fronts.""We have conquered all the bases in Buthidaung and also took over the town yesterday,"" Khine Thu Kha told Reuters by telephone.Some Rohingya activists accuse the AA of targeting the community during the assault on Buthidaung and surrounding areas, forcing many of them to flee for safety.""AA troops came into downtown, forced the people to leave their homes and started torching houses,"" Nay San Lwin, co-founder of the Free Rohingya Coalition advocacy group told Reuters, based on what he said were eyewitness accounts.""While the town was burning, I spoke with several people I have known and trusted for years.

NEW DELHI: Britain on Tuesday said that it would begin making further interim compensation payments to victims of the blood scandal that had led to the death of over 3,000 people in the 1970s to the early 1990s.""The government will be making further interim payments ahead of the establishment of the full scheme,"" minister John Glen told Parliament on Tuesday.""Payments of 210,000 pounds will be made to living infected beneficiaries,"" he added.The government's decision comes a day after UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak made a ""wholehearted unequivocal apology for this terrible injustice"" and promised a ""comprehensive compensation"" to those affected.Sunak's ""unequivocal apology"" was in the backdrop of a damning report that blamed the successive UK governments, officials and doctors for failures and cover-ups.The report found that British authorities and the country's public health service knowingly exposed tens of thousands of patients to deadly infections like HIV/Aids and Hepatitis C through contaminated blood and blood products, and hid the truth about the disaster for decades.These tainted batches were imported from the United States and widely administered to patients during for nearly two decades. The infections occurred due to the lack of testing for HIV/AIDS until 1986 and Hepatitis C until 1991 in the United Kingdom.""This is a day of shame for the British state, The result of this inquiry should shake our nation to its core,"" Sunak told the British Parliament on Monday.He told the MPs, ""I want to make a wholehearted and unequivocal apology for this terrible injustice,"" and vowed to pay ""whatever it costs"" to make amends for the victims and their families.After a five-year investigation, Langstaff in his report noted that ""The scale of what happened is horrifying. The most accurate estimate is that more than 3,000 deaths are attributable to infected blood, blood products and tissue"".Langstaff's report also addresses the question of a cover-up, stating, ""Standing back, and viewing the response of the NHS and of government, the answer to the question 'was there a cover up?' is that there has been. Not in the sense of a handful of people plotting in an orchestrated conspiracy to mislead, but in a way that was more subtle, more pervasive and more chilling in its implications. To save face and to save expense, there has been a hiding of much of the truth.""The extensive 2,527-page, seven-volume document delves into the immense scale of the scandal and presents a series of recommendations.

After Monday's hearing, two senior judges said Assange's argument that he might not be able to rely on the US First Amendment right to free speech deserved a full appeal, which is unlikely to be held for months.The news prompted cheering from supporters, holding placards ""Free, free Julian Assange!"". ""As a family we're relieved but how long can this go on?"" said Assange's wife Stella. ""The US should read the situation and drop this case now.""Assange himself was not present, which his lawyer said was for health reasons. The US justice department declined to comment on a pending judicial matter. Had Monday's ruling gone against him, Assange's team said he could have been on a plane to the US within 24 hours, ending over 13 years of legal battles in Britain.US prosecutors had told the court Assange could ""seek to rely"" upon the First Amendment protections granted to US citizens, and would not be discriminated against because of his nationality. But his legal team said a US court would not be bound by this. ""We say this is a blatantly inadequate assurance,"" lawyer Edward Fitzgerald told the judges. The HC also concluded that Assange's appeal should apply to all 18 counts, not only three, as lawyers for the US had argued. Fitzgerald did, however, accept a separate US assurance that Assange would not face the death penalty.","WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is given permission to appeal against extradition to the United States.

Over the past four years the inquiry has reviewed evidence from more than 5,000 witnesses and more than 100,000 documents.The inquiry heard estimates that more than 30,000 people, including hundreds of children, were infected with HIV or hepatitis C, a kind of liver infection, from contaminated blood or blood products provided by the public health system.Many of those affected were people with hemophilia, a condition affecting the blood's ability to clot. In the 1970s, patients were given a new treatment that the UK imported from the United States. Some of the plasma used to make the blood products was traced to high-risk donors, including prison inmates, who were paid to give blood samples.Because manufacturers of the treatment mixed plasma from thousands of donations, one infected donor would compromise the whole batch.Others were infected through tainted blood transfusions that were given to patients after childbirth, surgery or accidents.Britain's government is expected to pay compensation of about 10 billion pounds ($12.7 billion) in all to victims, though details about that payment are not expected until Tuesday.Des Collins, a lawyer representing 1,500 of the victims, called the report's publication a ""day of truth.""""They have spent years bravely telling their stories, campaigning and spurring collective action in order to get to this point. For some, it has been 40 years since their lives were forever blighted or loved ones were lost in cruel circumstances,"" he said. ""Several thousands, sadly, have not lived to see this day.""Diana Johnson, a lawmaker who has long campaigned for the victims, said she hoped that those found responsible for the disaster will face justice including prosecution - though the investigations have taken so long that some of the key players may well have died since.""There has to be accountability for the actions that were taken, even if it was 30, 40, 50 years ago,"" she said.","Britain's government expected to apologize for infected blood scandal.
