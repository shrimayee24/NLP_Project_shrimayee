JAMMU: The progress in PoK is superficial and largely driven by Chinese funding with negligible Pakistani contribution, J&K CM Omar Abdullah said Tuesday in the assembly amid a heated debate between National Conference (NC) and opposition BJP over border infrastructure.“We have to accept that while there is limited development in our frontier areas, on the other side, there have been deliberate attempts to showcase progress. However, this so-called development was facilitated by China, not Pakistan,” Omar said.His remarks came after NC MLA Saifullah Mir suggested that infrastructure in PoK was better than on the Indian side. BJP’s RS Pathania objected, leading to intervention from NC’s Nazir Gurezi and Peoples Conference’s Sajad Gani Lone, who defended Mir and highlighted the challenges faced by locals, especially in winter.Mir said: “If someone had worn a coat, what is wrong when I say he is having a good coat?”Mocking portrayal of prosperity in PoK, Omar said: “They made people wear coats to create the facade of development. In reality, the pockets of those coats are empty.”Urging restraint, Omar said the assembly should not get entangled in unnecessary arguments. “Development should happen wherever needed.”Deputy CM Surinder Choudhary assured that the demand for a tunnel in Kupwara’s Keran and Jumgund areas would be taken up with the Union highways ministry.Agriculture minister Javed Ahmad Dar highlighted National Mission on Saffron’s success, saying cultivation of Kashmir’s prized spice has remained stable at 3,715 hectares since 2010-11, with plans for expansion.","J&K CM Omar Abdullah says progress in PoK is largely driven by Chinese funding with negligible Pakistani contribution.

BAGESHWAR: It was a calm and quiet evening, but soon screams and cries for help ripped through the darkness in Uttarakhand's Kafoli village as a leopard cub barged into the kitchen of a house and attacked a woman and her daughter. Seeing the intruder, their pet dog, Jullie - a local breed - jumped in to rescue its masters and started biting the big cat fiercely.The pet fought off the leopard, which seemed to be around six months old, for nearly 20 minutes. The fight came to an end after the injured big cat stumbled after hitting a heavy iron stove kept outside the kitchen door. As the appliance fell sideways, the cowering leopard got trapped between the stands.The leopard cub entered the house of Trilok Chandra Pandey around 8pm on Monday. His wife, Kamla Devi, 45, and their daughter, Vijaya, 15, were in the kitchen. Instinctively, she pushed her daughter out of the way. Their frantic bid to escape left them with injuries as they fell on the ground hard.The terrified family alerted the forest department, which dispatched a rescue team to capture the animal. Forest ranger Shyam Singh Karayat said the dog left several bite wounds on the wild animal.Kamla suffered fractures in both her jaws, while Vijaya suffered minor wounds. The two were taken to district hospital 14 km away, but as it lacked proper infrastructure, they were advised to go back home after first aid and return the next morning. With no other option, they walked back home in the middle of the night.Pandey said leopard encounters have become more frequent in the village. ""Over a dozen leopards prowl in the area, making it unsafe for people even during the day. We can't even tie our livestock outside anymore ,"" he said.","A leopard cub entered the house of Trilok Chandra Pandey around 8pm on Monday.

BATHINDA/CHANDIGARH: Punjab Police raided the homes of several farm leaders across the state in a sweeping pre-dawn crackdown on Tuesday, detaining many ahead of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) protest in Chandigarh on March 5. The action followed failed talks between SKM and Punjab government on Monday evening, with farmers accusing chief minister Bhagwant Mann of walking out in frustration.Mann defended the police action, saying protests should not cause public inconvenience. ""I am the custodian of 3.5 crore people... Such actions trouble the public. How will the food grain godowns be cleared if the rails are blocked?"" Mann said.He accused farmers' unions of turning Punjab into a ""state of dharnas"" and engaging in a ""credit war"" while trying to ""create anarchy by running a parallel govt"".Farmers have been protesting at Sambhu and Khanauri along Punjab-Haryana border for the past year, pressing for legal guarantees for MSP, among other demands.Police targeted leaders from various organisations, including BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) chief Joginder Singh Ugrahan, vice-president Jhanda Singh Jethuke, BKU (Rajewal) president Balbir Singh Rajewal, BKU (Lakhowal) leader Harinder Lakhowal, and Kirti Kisan Union's Rajinder Singh Deep Wala.At select locations, farmers resisted police, even laying siege to local police stations. In Fatehgarh Chhanna village in Barnala, protesters blocked the arrest of BKU (Ugrahan) leader Balour Chhana by sitting in front of a police vehicle. In Moga, members of Krantikari Kisan Union secured the release of Jagtar Mallah from Baghapurana police station.SKM released a statement calling the detentions a ""dictatorial step"" by the Mann govt and vowed to continue their protest. The group demanded immediate release of all detained leaders and called on farmers across Punjab to join the week-long protest and hold village-level campaigns to expose what they termed as "" anti-farmer police action "".Reacting strongly to Tuesday morning's police action, farm leaders accused AAP government of attempting to suppress a democratic protest. Joginder Singh Ugrahan of BKU (Ugrahan) and Rajinder Singh Deep Singh Wala said in a joint statement that ""such provocative action was never expected from the CM"".SKM (Non-Political) leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal said: ""Snatching the right to demonstrate is undemocratic.""Opposition parties in the state, including BJP, Congress, and SAD, slammed AAP government's move.

BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh minister Prahlad Patel has sparked a controversy by equating public demands and petitions to govt with ""begging"". At a function in Rajgarh district on Saturday, panchayat and rural development minister Patel said this ""army of beggars"" is weakening society.""People have developed a habit of begging from govt. Politicians come, they get a basketful of papers. They are garlanded on stage and a letter is put in their hands. This is not a good habit. Instead of taking, develop the mindset of giving. You will be happy and will build a cultured society. Gathering an army of beggars does not strengthen society, but weakens it. The attraction towards free things is not a mark of respect for these brave women,"" Patel, a former Union minister, said after unveiling a statue of Rani Avantibai Lodhi at Suthaliya town.""Can you name any martyr who has ever begged? Despite this, we continue to organise programmes, make speeches, and move on,"" Patel said, adding that as a ""Narmada Parikrama pilgrim"", he has asked for alms, but never for himself. Videos of his speech were shared on social media, triggering sharp criticism from opposition Congress.PCC president Jitu Patwari posted on X: ""Residents of the state, arrogant BJP is now calling the public beggars! This is an insult to the hopes and tears of those in sorrow! They make false promises during elections and then backtrack. When people remind them of their promises, they call them beggars.

If BJP calls a demand for rights begging, then the public must consider how those who beg for votes dare to openly call them beggars. If those who beg for votes and remain in power as traders of authority can call the public beggars, it would be a historic insult to public opinion!

He pioneered the impeachment movement against the president, initially presenting impeachment articles in October 2017, followed by two additional attempts in 2019.

President Trump Addresses Joint Session of Congress, March 4, 2025

United States President Donald Trump addressed Congress on Wednesday (Tuesday in the US) for the first time since returning to power for his second term. Trump's speech was on the heels of his sweeping decisions on tariffs, immigration, Ukraine and the layoff of federal employees.Trump recently imposed retaliatory tariffs on rival China and neighbouring nations like Canada and Mexico. In another bold move, the US President paused aid to war-ravaged Ukraine, steering away from the predecessor Biden's policy of backing Kyiv.The stopping of aid to Ukraine came after an ugly verbal spat between Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Oval Office."" America is back "" is how Trump began his address to the Congress amid Republicans chanting USA! in the House.Donald Trump opened his address to a joint session of Congress with a bold declaration that ""America is back"". Reflecting on his early days in office, Trump said: ""Just six weeks ago, I stood beneath this Capitol's dome and spoke of the 'dawn of the golden age of America'. Since then, we have taken swift and decisive action to bring about one of the most successful periods in our nation’s history.""Addressing the disruptions, Speaker Mike Johnson urged audience members to uphold decorum. ""Consider this your warning"", he stated. ""Members are deliberately and repeatedly violating decorum, and if necessary, the chair will instruct the sergeant at arms to restore order to the joint session"".About 10 Democrats walked out after revealing black T-shirts with messages on them. Representative Jasmine Crockett's shirt on the back said, ""RESIST."" Crockett left along with Representative Maxwell Frost whose shirt said, ""NO KINGS LIVE HERE"".The US President took a dig at the Democrats saying: ""I look at the Democrats in front of me and I realise there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud, nothing I can do.""""I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations,"" Trump said. ""These people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand, and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won't do it no matter what... It's very sad. And it just shouldn't be this way... Democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, why not join us in celebrating, so many incredible wins for America,"" Trump said in the longest presidential speech to Congress.""Our country will be woke no longer"", Trump said, referring to his moves to eliminate diversity measures in the federal government. ""We've ended the tyranny of so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion policies all across the entire federal government, and indeed, the private sector, and our military,"" Trump said. Crockett left along with Representative Maxwell Frost whose shirt said, ""NO KINGS LIVE HERE"".While addressing the Congress, Trump said: "" We have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools. I signed an order making it the official policy of the US government that there are only two genders, male and female.""The US President declared that he will announce reciprocal tariffs on April 2, matching barriers in other countries. ""Whatever they tax us, we will tax them. If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market."" Trump also listed India among countries charging high tariffs on American imports.""On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India...and countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them, it is very unfair. India charges us tariffs 100 per cent. the system is not fair to US, it never was,"" Trump said.Trump said he received a new letter from Zelenskyy, advocating for peace in war against Russia.""The letter reads, Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians.' He said, 'My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts. We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence. Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it at any time that is convenient for you,"" Trump said.""I appreciate that he sent this letter, just got it a little while ago. Simultaneously, we've had serious discussions with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace. Wouldn't that be beautiful,"" he said.On Gaza, Trump said: ""In the Middle East, we're bringing back our hostages from Gaza,"", calling the Middle East ""a rough neighborhood.""Trump claimed he had done away with the ""ridiculous Green New Scam"", referring to the clean energy and environmental policies introduced under former President Joe Biden. However, key provisions of Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act—such as tax credits for electric vehicles, hydrogen, and solar power—are still in place. To fully roll back these measures, Congress would need to amend or repeal the IRA.Donald Trump called his predecessor ""worst President in the history of American history"", claiming that thousands of illegal crossings happened in America under Biden's presidency.""Within hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern border. I deployed US military and border patrol to repel the invasion of our country and what a job they have done! As a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded. In comparison, under Joe Biden - the worst President in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month,"" Trump said.Trump pledged to eliminate taxes on tips, overtime pay, and social security benefits for seniors, claiming that tax cuts were a major priority during his first term.Meanwhile, a Republican-led effort in the Senate to make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent—without accounting for the impact on the federal deficit—has sparked concerns among fiscal conservatives and independent analysts. Critics warn that the move could contribute to a growing debt burden, potentially threatening economic stability.","US President Donald Trump addressed Congress for the first time since returning to power for his second term.

Recent designated survivors



Here are the designated survivors from recent years:



2024: Education Secretary Miguel Cardona

2023: Labor Secretary Marty Walsh

2022: Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo

2021: No designated survivor due to limited attendance amid COVID-19

2020: Interior Secretary David Bernhardt

2019: Energy Secretary Rick Perry

Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins has been selected as the designated survivor for President Donald Trump's 2025 joint address to Congress , White House sources confirmed shortly before the speech on Tuesday night.The tradition of appointing a designated survivor ensures continuity of government in the event of a catastrophic incident during the address, which is attended by the president, vice president, and the full line of succession. Collins, a former representative from Georgia, was confirmed as VA Secretary on February 4 and is 17th in the presidential line of succession .A designated survivor is a cabinet member chosen to remain at a secure, undisclosed location during the address. This precaution ensures that a government leader remains available to take charge if an emergency incapacitates those in attendance.While the US Constitution establishes the line of succession, the modern order was set by the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. Vice President JD Vance is first in line, followed by House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate President Pro Tempore Chuck Grassley, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The list continues through other cabinet members, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem being 18th.Since nearly all these officials attend the joint session, a designated survivor is selected to stay away.The practice of appointing a designated survivor is believed to have started during the Cold War in the 1950s, though it was first officially recorded in 1981 when Education Secretary Terrel Bell was given the role.The selection process remains classified, but the individual must meet presidential eligibility criteria: being a natural-born US citizen and at least 35 years old. Some past cabinet members, such as former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and Henry Kissinger, were ineligible due to being born outside the USFormer Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, designated in 1996 under President Bill Clinton, recalled her experience, saying, “I was shown the Situation Room and the White House staff talked seriously about the responsibility of the designated survivor.”Past designated survivors have shared their experiences, revealing they are accompanied by security personnel, including a military officer carrying the ""nuclear football.""Former Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who was chosen in 2000, described his experience, saying, “It’s fun. You’re sitting there, you’re being watched. You got security. And there are a few thrills.”Former Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who was designated in the 1990s, recalled in a 2017 Politico essay that he was taken to a secure location outside Washington. He wrote, “I don’t recall getting any specific instructions on what to do if the doomsday scenario happened… All I knew is that if necessary, I could turn to that military officer accompanying me, holding that 45-pound bag, and trigger a military response, including a nuclear strike.”Shalala, who remained in Washington during her time as designated survivor, recalled waiting at the White House and ordering pizza for her staff. “I saw the president when he left and when he came back,” she said. “He said, ‘Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.’”Typically, cabinet members from various departments have been selected for the role, though Secretaries of State, Defense, and Treasury have never been chosen.With Collins now assuming the role for 2025, the longstanding tradition continues as the Trump administration ensures the government's continuity during this high-profile address.","Doug Collins has been selected as the designated survivor for President Donald Trump's 2025 joint address to Congress.

The probe found that photos shared by soldiers on their first and last days at the base enabled Hamas to map out key locations, including surveillance cameras, generators, safe rooms, and patrol movements. Captured Palestinian fighters later admitted they had built training models of Nahal Oz using this information.To prevent similar intelligence leaks, the IDF is now banning photography inside military facilities, enforcing strict penalties for violations, and extending security classifications to a broader range of roles. Soldiers and officers will also be prohibited from using social media platforms like Facebook while serving in sensitive positions. Additionally, public filming of civilian-attended military ceremonies and events will be restricted.The investigation also found that Nahal Oz soldiers received no warning before the attack. Security protocols did not account for rocket fire or the protection of unarmed personnel, and ground assault drills had not been conducted for years.Further army probes revealed that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad deployed around 5,000 fighters in coordinated attacks on Israeli communities and military positions along the Gaza border. Intelligence about the looming assault was misinterpreted, and the army was more focused on threats from Iran and Hezbollah. The reports, made public on Thursday, addressed operational failures but did not examine political decisions.Growing calls for an independent inquiry into the October 7 failures have intensified. Such a commission, typically led by a senior Supreme Court justice, would have broader authority to summon witnesses and collect evidence. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has opposed the move, saying on Monday he would not support a ""politically biased"" investigation. His remarks sparked clashes between bereaved families and Knesset security personnel.On October 7, Hamas attacks near the Gaza border resulted in at least 1,180 deaths and the abduction of 252 Israelis and foreign nationals.

Trump’s endgame? Trudeau alleges annexation motive

Markets rattle as trade tensions escalate

No resolution in sight

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared on Tuesday that Canada will not back down in its escalating trade war with the United States, calling US President Donald Trump ’s tariffs a “very dumb thing to do.” In response, Trudeau announced 25% retaliatory tariffs on $30 billion worth of US imports.“The United States launched a trade war against Canada… Canadians are reasonable. We are polite. We will not back down from a fight,” Trudeau said, emphasizing that while he considers Trump a “smart guy,” his trade policies are reckless.Trudeau went further, claiming Trump’s ultimate goal is to see Canada’s economy “collapse” to make annexation “easier.” The explosive remark comes as Washington implements sweeping tariffs—25% on Canadian and Mexican imports and 10% on Canadian energy exports.Trump, who has previously floated the idea of making Canada the 51st US state, has defended the tariffs as necessary to protect American jobs. However, Trudeau’s comments mark the strongest Canadian pushback yet, suggesting a deeper geopolitical motive behind the economic conflict.Global markets reacted negatively, with the Dow dropping over 500 points following the announcement. Economic analysts warn the tariffs could trigger inflation and disrupt North American supply chains. Canada’s countermeasures, set to take effect in three weeks, will target key US sectors, including agriculture and steel.Meanwhile, Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum vowed to impose retaliatory tariffs, adding another layer to the growing North American trade dispute. Experts say Trump’s moves could push US trade policy back to its most protectionist stance since World War II.Despite diplomatic efforts, neither side appears willing to de-escalate. “Our tariffs will remain in place until US trade action is withdrawn,” Trudeau said.With both countries digging in, the trade war shows no signs of easing—raising fears of long-term economic consequences for businesses and consumers on both sides of the border.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared on Tuesday that Canada will not back down in its escalating trade war with the United States.

A ‘rising star’ takes the stage

What to expect from Slotkin’s response

The stakes are high

Senator Elissa Slotkin , a former CIA analyst and rising Democratic star, will deliver her party’s response to President Donald Trump ’s address to Congress on Tuesday. Slotkin, who won Michigan’s Senate seat last year in a fiercely contested race, is set to present the Democratic vision in a speech that aims to counter Trump’s expected rhetoric.Slotkin, 48, made history as the youngest Democratic woman elected to the Senate and now represents a key swing state that former Vice-President Kamala Harris lost in the 2024 election. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called her ""great on both economic and national security issues,"" touting her as the ideal choice to take on Trump in primetime.""From our economic security to our national security, we've got to chart a way forward that actually improves people's lives in the country we all love,"" Slotkin said in a statement ahead of her speech.Slotkin’s rebuttal is expected to hammer home the Democrats’ key message: protecting working-class Americans while Republicans ""cut taxes for their billionaire donors and Elon Musk ,"" as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries put it. She will focus on lowering the cost of living, defending Social Security and Medicaid , and presenting a stark contrast to Trump’s economic policies.Her selection signals the Democratic Party’s intent to showcase moderate voices with strong national security credentials. Before entering politics, Slotkin served as a CIA analyst and held key roles in both the Bush and Obama administrations. She was deployed to Iraq three times before moving to the National Security Council and the Pentagon.Slotkin’s speech comes at a pivotal moment, with Trump’s return to Washington reigniting fierce political battles. As one of the Senate’s newest faces, she will need to balance Democratic priorities while appealing to the swing voters who helped her secure Michigan.With her intelligence background and centrist credentials, Slotkin may prove to be one of the Democrats’ strongest voices against Trump—both on Tuesday night and in the battles ahead.","Elissa Slotkin, 48, is a rising Democratic star who won Michigan's Senate seat last year.

He reflected on his inaugural address, calling it the ‘dawn of the golden age of America’ and claimed his leadership had ushered in a period of unmatched success.Several Democratic lawmakers staged a silent protest during the speech, holding signs criticising Trump and his allies. Some read “Musk steals,” referencing the billionaire’s close ties with the president, while others said “false,” “save Medicaid,” and “protect veterans.”The speech comes at a pivotal moment in Trump’s presidency, as he faces economic turbulence and foreign policy challenges.

Who is Doug Collins?



What happens during the speech?



Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins has been named the designated survivor for President Donald Trump’s 2025 joint address to Congress, ensuring continuity of government in case of a catastrophic event during the high-profile gathering.The White House confirmed Collins’ selection shortly before the speech on Tuesday night. As designated survivor, he was taken to a secure, undisclosed location while Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and top government officials convened in the Capitol. Collins, who was confirmed as VA Secretary on February 4, 2025, is 17th in the presidential line of succession .A designated survivor is a cabinet member chosen to remain away from the event to ensure the continuity of government in case of an attack or disaster that incapacitates the leadership. The practice, which dates back to the Cold War era, was first officially recorded in 1981 when Education Secretary Terrel Bell was selected.The designated survivor must meet presidential eligibility criteria, including being a natural-born US citizen and at least 35 years old. Some cabinet members in the past, such as former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and Henry Kissinger, were ineligible due to being born outside the US.Former Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, who served as the designated survivor in 1996, recalled, “I was shown the Situation Room and the White House staff talked seriously about the responsibility of the designated survivor.”Collins, a former congressman from Georgia’s 9th congressional district, served from 2013 to 2021 before being appointed Secretary of Veterans Affairs. He has a background in law, having worked as a managing partner at the Collins and Csider law firm since 2010. His military experience includes serving as a Navy chaplain in the late 1980s before joining the US Air Force Reserve Command, where he holds the rank of Colonel.As VA Secretary, Collins oversees nearly 200 medical centers and manages a budget of approximately $350 billion, aiming to improve care quality and address veterans’ health challenges.Designated survivors are accompanied by security personnel, including a military officer carrying the “nuclear football.” Former Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who was the designated survivor in 2000, described the experience, saying, “It’s fun. You’re sitting there, you’re being watched. You got security.

Donald Trump’s during his first joint address of the Congress sported a dark purple patterned tie and not his usual bold red tie. In politics, purple is often seen as a blend of Republican red and Democratic blue, symbolising bipartisanship and unity, as reported by the Wall Street Journal.The speech itself began with a characteristic show of confidence. “America is back,” Trump declared. He framed his presidency as an era of swift and decisive action, portraying his policies as the key to restoring American strength.Melania Trump watched from the gallery, joined by other congressmen. Trump's key ally Elon Musk was also present, wearing a blue tie.The guests also included the widow of a fallen NYPD officer, a victim of explicit deepfake images, and a teacher recently freed from detention in Russia. Democrats, in contrast, invited federal workers affected by Trump’s budget cuts and government watchdogs dismissed under his administration.The address also saw protests across the country, with demonstrators gathering in all 50 states to oppose Trump’s policies. While their grievances ranged from economic concerns to his handling of foreign affairs, the widespread opposition underscored the deeply polarising nature of his presidency.The address comes at a pivotal moment, with Trump navigating economic turmoil, foreign policy tensions, and a deeply divided Congress. Inflation remains a major concern for voters, with consumer confidence sinking and market gains since his re-election now erased. His response has been to double down on aggressive trade policies, including new tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. These measures have sparked fears of a trade war, adding further uncertainty to an already volatile economy.Despite the controversies, Trump’s grip on the Republican Party remains firm. His speech was met with enthusiasm from GOP lawmakers, with House Speaker Mike Johnson declaring, “We will not be ripping up the speech tonight. I would like to frame it in gilded gold.”Foreign policy was another major focus. Trump recently froze military aid to Ukraine, pressuring President Volodymyr Zelenskyy into negotiations with Russia. This move has drawn sharp criticism, with many Democrats and some Republicans condemning what they see as an abandonment of a key ally. Lawmakers showed their opposition by wearing blue and yellow in solidarity with Ukraine.","Donald Trump sported a dark purple patterned tie during his speech.

The administration’s moves have included shutting down agencies and dismissing numerous government employees.Trump’s global policy shifts have also sparked controversy, with the president pausing military aid to Ukraine while engaging Russia, declaring his intent to “own” Gaza, and imposing tariffs on US allies.The White House confirmed the address would center on “the renewal of the American dream,” sharing links to Fox News, which reported that Trump would discuss domestic and foreign policy achievements, economic plans, border security funding , and his vision for global peace.“President Trump is the greatest orator we’ve ever had in the Oval Office.

KYIV: President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine on Tuesday offered a course of action that he said could end the war, while trying to assure the Trump administration that his government was dedicated to peace.""Our meeting in Washington, at the White House on Friday, did not go the way it was supposed to be,"" Zelenskyy wrote on the social platform X. ""It is regrettable that it happened this way.

""My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts.""There was no immediate reaction from the Kremlin to Zelenskyy's proposal.In recent weeks, however, President Vladimir Putin of Russia has offered no hint of being willing to de-escalate the war before winning major concessions from the West and Ukraine -- like ruling out Ukrainian Nato membership, reducing the alliance's footprint in Europe, limiting the size of Ukraine's military, and giving Russia influence over Ukraine's domestic politics.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy offered a course of action that he said could end the war.

'So sleazy': Capitol Hill buzzes over Republican Sen. Joni Ernst’s alleged military affairs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/so-sleazy-capitol-hill-buzzes-over-republican-sen-joni-ernsts-alleged-military-affairs/articleshow/118718331.cms,"Republican Sen. Joni Ernst

Republican Sen. Joni Ernst , a key figure in military oversight , has been thrust into controversy after reports surfaced alleging her involvement with not one but two military officials—one of whom was a disgraced Air Force general demoted for inappropriate relationships on Capitol Hill.According to a bombshell ProPublica investigation , Ernst was named as one of the alleged partners of retired Maj. Gen. Christopher Finerty, who was demoted after a military probe uncovered his illicit affairs with multiple women. Finerty, once a rising star in the Air Force’s legislative affairs office, was forced into early retirement in November 2023 after investigators found he had engaged in “sexual, inappropriate, or unprofessional relationships.”While the inspector general’s report redacted the names of Finerty’s partners, two sources confirmed to ProPublica that Ernst was among them. According to the Daily Beast, the revelations have raised serious ethical concerns, as Finerty, described as a de facto lobbyist for the Air Force, may have influenced legislative decisions while engaged in the alleged affair.One Air Force source characterized the situation as “so sleazy” that it tainted the branch’s interactions with Congress. Ernst, a combat veteran and a key member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, wields significant influence over Pentagon funding—further intensifying the scandal ’s implications.Adding to the intrigue, three sources told ProPublica that Finerty was not Ernst’s only romantic entanglement with a military official. In 2019, the same year she finalized her divorce, she allegedly had a relationship with a Navy legislative affairs officer. The affair reportedly created friction between her office and the Navy, further complicating Ernst’s standing on military matters.The senator’s office has refused to directly deny the allegations, instead dismissing them as “tabloid journalism.” A spokesperson issued a defiant statement: “The fake news media is clearly too busy gossiping to report the real news that Senator Ernst is focused on cutting waste at the Pentagon. Any insinuation otherwise is a slanderous lie—full stop.”Finerty’s attorney has also denied any wrongdoing, insisting that his client never leveraged personal relationships for undue influence. However, the military’s investigation found text exchanges between Finerty and at least one Capitol Hill woman in which personal and professional discussions appeared intertwined.One particularly damning exchange from 2021 allegedly involved Finerty sending a list of Air Force priorities—fighter jets, radar technology, and military interoperability improvements—to a romantic partner. The woman, whose identity was redacted, reportedly responded flirtatiously before sending explicit images, to which Finerty allegedly quipped, “This whole no more sexting didn’t last long huh?”The Air Force’s report acknowledged that while there was “no direct evidence of favors or sensitive information being exchanged,” the perception of unethical behavior created serious concerns.As the scandal unfolds, questions swirl about whether Ernst’s alleged relationships affected her legislative decisions. Given her role in shaping military policy, the controversy threatens to cast a long shadow over her political future. Whether ethics investigators or Senate colleagues will demand further scrutiny remains to be seen, but for now, Ernst finds herself at the center of one of Washington’s most salacious political firestorms in recent memory.","Republican Sen.

"Trade war escalates: Trudeau slams Trump’s tariffs, vows retaliation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trade-war-escalates-trudeau-slams-trumps-tariffs-vows-retaliation-things-to-know/articleshow/118717362.cms,"Trudeau warned that American businesses and consumers would feel the impact of these tariffs, addressing Trump directly: “This is a very dumb thing to do.”

Canada responds with tariffs

Trudeau accuses Trump of economic sabotage

Fentanyl claims rejected as ‘false excuse’

Trump’s tariffs timeline

February 1: Trump signed an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada, with an extra 10% tariff on Canadian energy products.

February 3: The US announced a one-month delay in implementing additional tariffs to allow further negotiations.

March 4: The full 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods are set to take effect.

With both nations escalating trade restrictions, tensions between the longtime allies have reached a breaking point, setting the stage for a prolonged economic standoff.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has strongly condemned US President Donald Trump ’s decision to impose tariffs on Canadian goods, calling it an unjustified trade war and vowing to fight back.Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Trudeau criticized the US move, saying, “Today, the US launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally.” In response, Canada imposed 30 billion Canadian dollars ($21 billion) in tariffs on US goods, with a promise to escalate the countermeasures to 125 billion Canadian dollars within three weeks.Trudeau warned that American businesses and consumers would feel the impact of these tariffs, addressing Trump directly: “This is a very dumb thing to do.”The Canadian leader went further, accusing Trump of deliberately trying to cripple Canada’s economy for political and strategic reasons. He suggested that the US president sees Canada’s economic downfall as a means to strengthen US leverage and even push for annexation.“Trump wants to see a complete collapse of the Canadian economy,” Trudeau claimed. “Because that will make it easier to annex us. That is never going to happen.”Trudeau also dismissed Trump’s justification for the tariffs—citing fentanyl smuggling from Canada—as “an unjustified and false excuse.”To address US concerns, Canada had taken proactive steps, including appointing a “fentanyl czar” and designating Mexican cartels as terrorist groups. However, these efforts did not prevent Trump from moving forward with the tariffs.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has strongly condemned US President Donald Trump ’s decision to impose tariffs on Canadian goods.

ISLAMABAD: At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque of an Islamic religious school known as the “university of jihad” in Nowshera district of Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province on Friday.Among the dead were Maulana Hamid-ul-Haq Haqqani , head of Dar-ul-Uloom Haqqania school, the seminary in Nowshera’s Akora Khattak town where key Afghan Taliban leaders have studied. Mullah Omer, the slain founder of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, was also an alumni of this religious school.Graduates of the seminary include current Afghan Taliban leaders Amir Khan Muttaqi, Sirajuddin Haqqani, Abdul Latif Mansoor, Maulvi Ahmad Jan, Mullah Jalaludin Haqani, Maulvi Qalamudin, Arifullah Arif and Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa.The explosion occurred in the main prayer hall as people gathered for weekly Friday prayers were leaving the mosque.KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed confirmed that it was a suicide attack and that three policemen were also injured. “More than a dozen police officers were guarding the mosque when the attack occurred, and Haq’s seminary also had its own security,” he said.“It appears that Hamid Haqqani (seminary’s slain chief) was the target,” Hameed added.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, which came on the last Friday ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Yawar Zia, a police constable, who was injured in the attack, said he was on security duty at the seminary when the blast happened and splinters hit him. “After offering prayer, Hamid-ul-Haq, accompanied by his guards, was leaving the mosque when the powerful explosion occurred,” the wounded official said.Eyewitnesses described a chaotic scene, with blood and body parts scattered all over the place. They said the casualties could have been much higher had the bomber struck during the prayers.Haqqani, the son of slain prominent Pakistani cleric Sami-ul-Haq Haqqani, known as the “father of Taliban, was a vice-chancellor of the sprawling seminary, located 60 km from the provincial capital of Peshawar. Following his father’s assassination in 2018, he also became chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Sami (JUI-S) political party. He had also previously served as a member of the National Assembly from 2002 to 2007.Haq was also among the few who called on the world and Pakistan to immediately recognise the Taliban govt and establish diplomatic relations with Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul in 2021.Last year, he led a delegation of religious scholars to Afghanistan for “religious diplomacy” meetings with Taliban leaders.His seminary had faced controversy in the past as its students were accused of involvement in the assassination of Pakistan’s former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. The madrasa, however, denied any connection with the suspects.","At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque.

China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong , marking the first time a foreign national will be aboard the facility.The deal was signed in a ceremony held in Islamabad on Friday, between the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) and Pakistan’s Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO). Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was alos present during the ceremony.According to a statement by CMSA, both nations will collaborate on selecting and training Pakistani astronauts, with the chosen candidate expected to join Chinese taikonauts for a short-term mission in the coming years.""This signifies a major step in China’s international space cooperation ,"" reported Global Times, highlighting the growing partnership between Beijing and Islamabad in aerospace advancements.China’s space station, which has been operational for nearly four years, was built after the country was reportedly excluded from the International Space Station (ISS) due to concerns over the involvement of China’s military in its space programme.The station is also seen as a new frontier of competition between China and the US.As per the news agency PTI, the agreement further solidifies China’s support for Pakistan’s space ambitions, following previous collaborations such as the launch of Pakistani satellites.Pakistan’s first digital communications satellite, Badr-1, was launched aboard a Chinese Long March 2E rocket in 1990, while earlier this year, Pakistan’s CubeSat accompanied China’s Chang’e-6 probe to the Moon.According to Global Times, the selection of the astronaut is expected to take around a year, after which the candidate will undergo intensive training in China. This move, experts say, demonstrates the reliability of China's manned space technology and its willingness to lower barriers for developing countries to participate in space exploration .China has also set ambitious goals for space exploration, with plans to land astronauts on the Moon before 2030.Meanwhile, the US has its sights set on returning to the lunar surface by 2025.","China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong.

Clock running out for refugees in Islamabad, Rawalpindi



'We've worked with the Americans for years'



Kabul, Islamabad row amid rising crackdown



Forced to move after decades in Pakistan



UN says Pakistan has a tradition of protecting Afghans

A woman who we will call Fatima fled Afghanistan with her family in December 2021. She had worked for an American non-profit organization in Kabul ­until the US pullout in the summer of 2021, when the Taliban retook control of the country.She is now based in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. And she is in trouble. Her Pakistani visa is days away from expiring, and the authorities are still processing her renewal application.""I am concerned about the renewal of my visa, and if not renewed timely authorities would arrest me and my family for illegally residing in the country,"" Fatima told DW.Police, including female officers, recently conducted a raid on a building where Fatima lives, looking for undocumented Afghan refugees. She was not in the building at the time, but her brother ended up in custody.""Later, we showed them our visa renewal application receipts and proof but police did not cooperate,"" said Fatima, who is now hiding from the authorities.In 2023, Pakistan started a massive initiative to repatriate approximately 4 million Afghans who have entered the country over the past 40 years. And while the authorities granted some leeway last year, Pakistan's government has now set a March 31 deadline to expel foreign nationals residing in the country illegally, with search operations ongoing in January and February.Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi ""have been verbally asked to leave Pakistan till 28th February,"" Umer Gillani, a legal expert and rights activist, told DW.Moniza Kakar, a lawyer working for refugees advocacy in Pakistan, said there was ""uncertainty and fear"" among the Afghani nationals in the area.""Since the start of this year, over 1,000 Afghans have been detained in Islamabad, and more than 18,000 have been forced to leave Islamabad and Rawalpindi because of government orders,"" she said.Amin, 28, is from Kabul. He spent years collaborating with the United States in the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan, before he too had to flee across the Pakistani border.Hee said he was just days away from being evacuated to America, but this was put on hold last month with President Donald Trump signing an executive order to suspend a refugee resettlement program.Nearly 20,000 Afghans are presently waiting in Pakistan for approval to resettle in the US through an American government program.""We've worked with the Americans for years, we helped and supported them in Afghanistan, we have given them a part of our lives and they have to support us so that we can live peacefully,"" Amin told DW.Over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with neighboring Afghanistan has deteriorated. Islamabad holds the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan responsible for their inability to control the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions with the Taliban regime escalate, concerns were also raised about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan amid reports of purported intimidation and arrests. The UN special rapporteur has expressed his worries, stating that Afghans in the area deserve more humane treatment.Activist Gilani said millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan are being used as ""hostages to build pressure whenever there is tension between the two countries.""Last week, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry dismissed claims made by the Afghan representation regarding the mistreatment of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, labeling these allegations as ""misplaced"" and urging Kabul to facilitate the smooth repatriation of Afghan citizens.Pakistan has accommodated hundreds of thousands of refugees from its northern neighbor, a situation resulting from decades of regional instability. Afghans who arrived in Pakistan following the Taliban takeover in August 2021 have been relying on visa renewals to stay in the country, a procedure that is costly, uncertain and often subject to significant delays.""The stories of refugees are devastating. Families who have lived in Pakistan for years, even decades, are now being uprooted due to tensions between the two countries. Children, women, and men who have already suffered so much are being treated as if they don't matter. This is not just a refugee crisis, it's a humanitarian crisis,"" said Kakar.UNHCR's top representative in Pakistan, Philippa Candler, told DW that Pakistan already repatriated over 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year.""As of December 2024, Pakistan hosted over 2.8 million Afghans with 69% of refugees living outside refugee villages,"" she said.Candler acknowledged Pakistan's generosity in hosting Afghan refugees for decades, and the current ""economic and security challenges"" in Pakistan that drive the repatriation efforts.At the same time, UNHCR was urging the Islamabad government to ""see the situation of Afghans through a humanitarian perspective"" and ""continue its long-standing tradition of protecting vulnerable Afghans […] regardless of their status.""""It's essential that we work hand-in-hand with both host countries and countries of origin to develop mechanisms that empower refugees to rebuild their lives in safety and dignity, including voluntary repatriation,"" she said.""We are calling for dialogue between the two countries, and for the refugee issue to be separated from political matters.""","Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi are in trouble. Pakistan's government has now set a March 31 deadline to expel foreign nationals residing in the country illegally. Nearly 20,000 Afghans are waiting in Pakistan for approval to resettle in the US through an American government program.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118572997,imgsize-927785,width-400,resizemode-4/118572997.jpg"

New York City is terminating a $220m deal with the Pakistan-owned Roosevelt Hotel to house a migrant shelter following a prolonged MAGA meltdown over use of American taxpayer money to facilitate immigration to the US.Under pressure from the federal government and MAGA hardliners, Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who gravitated to the Trump orbit after facing corruption charges from the Biden administration, announced closure of the site that is said to have housed tens of thousands of migrants in its 1025 rooms at $ 200 a night.The site opened in May 2023 to serve as both a new arrivals center and shelter for asylum seekers under a three-year $ 220 million deal with government-run Pakistan International Airlines, which owns the hotel, having bought out a Saudi stake in it for $ 36.4million in 2005.At peak traffic in 2023 when around 4000 migrants were arriving in the city each week, the sight of asylum seekers camping outside the hotel waiting to be processed triggered MAGA hardliners and even some New Yorkers, as Trump and his supporters complained about Democrats housing ""illegal immigrants"" in ""luxury hotels"" at the expense of US taxpayers.""A taxpayer-funded hotel for illegal migrants is owned by the Pakistani government, which means NYC taxpayers are effectively paying a foreign government to house illegals in our own country. This is nuts,"" Trump acolyte and MAGA major Vivel Ramaswamy had raged.Trump himself, lately exercised over a $ 21 million USAID allocation for a voter turnout program in India, had highlighted the purported scam saying the Biden administration had paid $ 59 million to an unspecified hotel in New York City to house illegal immigrants. Standing beside him, Musk had added that the city was paying double the normal rate for the room.Following the Trump victory, his new administration cited concerns about criminal activity at the hotel for freezing $80 million in FEMA funds to the city, by which time Pakistan had already raked in tens of millions of dollars.""FEMA was funding the Roosevelt Hotel that serves as a Tren de Aragua base of operations and was used to house Laken Riley's killer. There will not be a single penny spent that goes against the interest and safety of the American people,"" the homeland security department said, referring to the Venezuelan criminal gang, now declared a foreign terrorist organisation, said to be involved in the murder of an American nursing student.",New York City is terminating a $220m deal with the Pakistan-owned Roosevelt Hotel to house a migrant shelter.
