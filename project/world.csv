"23 terror hits in J&K so far this year, down from 222 in 2014",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/23-terror-hits-in-jk-so-far-this-year-down-from-222-in-2014/articleshow/113797640.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The marked improvement in security situation in J&K since the last assembly elections — with terror-related incidents this year down to one-tenth of the levels seen in 2014 — has been a major contributory factor in the good turnouts witnessed in most parts of Kashmir region, according to J&K administration sources. This, an official said, is significant as these are the first assembly polls in J&K after the nullification of Article 370 and its reorganisation into a Union Territory in 2019.However, polling percentages in all but one district of Jammu division, where voting is over, have dipped sincembere 2014.A plausible explanation could be the recent spike in terror activities in the region, among other things. Till Sept 27, 15 terror attacks and encounters had left 11 civilians and 17 security personnel dead in Jammu region.Of the 13 J&K districts that went to the polls in the first two phases on Sept 18 and 25, eight recorded average turnouts lower than in 2014 assembly polls. While five of these 13 districts are in Jammu region, three are in Kashmir Valley.Only one among the six Jammu districts where polling has been conducted in Phase 1 and 2 has shown a rise in voter turnout as compared to the 2014 polls, while four of the seven such districts in Kashmir recorded an upward trend in polling percentages. A comparison with 2024 LS polls shows that all but one district — Reasi in Jammu region — witnessed a lower turnout in the current polls.Reasi had witnessed the biggest terror attack of the year in July, with firing by terrorists on a bus killing eight passengers and the bus driver. Also, encounters with terrorists have caused multiple security forces casualties in Poonch and Rajouri in the recent months.Overall, terror-related incidents in J&K are down from 222 in 2014 to 23 so far this year, with 15 reported in Jammu region and 8 in Kashmir. Security forces’ fatalities too have fallen to 25, of which 17 were in Jammu region alone, from 47 in 2014, as have civilian killings from 28 in 2014 to 16 (11 in Jammu region & 5 in the Valley) in 2024.As many as 45 terrorists were killed this year against 110 in 2014. Of these, 35, including 18 foreign terrorists and 17 local terrorists, were neutralised in Kashmir while Jammu saw the end of 10 terrorists.As compared to 2014 that saw 23 grenade attacks, nine IED strikes and 41 hartal calls, 2024 has witnessed zero such incidents. “Four of the seven districts — Kulgam, Shopian, Pulwama and Srinagar, all once terror hotbeds — fared better in terms of voter turnout as compared to 2014 assembly polls,” a security official pointed out.Even the campaign and the two polling days so far were peaceful and incident-free, with no poll boycotts called by the separatists, who rather joined the democratic exercise as candidates, or the usual law and order disruptions like stone-pelting that would keep the Kashmiri voters indoors, said another officer.","Terror-related incidents in J&K are down to one-tenth of the levels seen in 2014.

The Iran-backed Hezbollah on Saturday confirmed the death of its leader Hassan Nasrallah in Israeli airstrikes on Friday. Recently, Israel eliminated several functionaries of the militant group and now it faces concern of who will succeed Nasrallah.According to several reports, Hashem Safieddine is considered a potential heir to Nasrallah.

He also serves on the group's Jihad Council .Safieddine's family ties and religious status as a descendant of Mohammed would all work in his favor as a potential successor, reported news agency Reuters.In 2017, the US State Department designated him as a terrorist, and in June, he threatened major escalation against Israel following the death of another Hezbollah commander. At the funeral, he warned, ""Let (the enemy) prepare himself to cry and wail.""Safieddine's public statements often reflect Hezbollah's militant stance and its alignment with the Palestinian cause. At a recent event in Dahiyeh, Hezbollah's stronghold in Beirut's southern suburbs, he declared, ""Our history, our guns and our rockets are with you,"" in a show of solidarity with Palestinian fighters.According to Philip Smyth, an expert on Iran-backed Shi-ite militias, said Nasrallah ""started tailoring positions for him within a variety of different councils within Lebanese Hezbollah. Some of them were more opaque than others. They've had him come, go out and speak,""He has also been outspoken in his criticism of US policy. In 2017, responding to American pressure on Hezbollah, he said, ""This mentally impeded, crazy US administration headed by Trump will not be able to harm the resistance,"" maintaining that such actions would only bolster Hezbollah's determination.Hassan Nasrallah joined the list of some of the important leaders and commanders Israel recently assassinated amid the conflicts that started on October 07, 2023, following a brutal attack by Hamas on Israel killing over a thousand people. Here are some of the other functionaries that were killed in recent months.The Hamas chief was assassinated in the early hours of July 31 in Iran.

India would have offered Pakistan more aid than IMF if ties were better: Rajnath Singh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-would-have-offered-pakistan-more-aid-than-imf-if-ties-were-better-rajnath-singh/articleshow/113794381.cms,"Rajnath Singh (ANI photo)

SRINAGAR: Union defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said India would have offered more aid to Pakistan, had the neighbouring country maintained good relations with it.Addressing an election rally in the Gurez assembly segment of Bandipora district in north Kashmir, Singh said India would have given a larger bailout package to Pakistan than that sought by Islamabad from IMF , had the neighbouring nation maintained friendly relations with Delhi.“Modi ji had, in 2014-15, announced a special package for development of J&K, which has now reached Rs 90,000 crore. The amount is much bigger than what Pakistan was seeking from the IMF (as bailout package),” Singh said.Singh referred to former PM Atal Behari Vajpayee’s famous statement that “we can change friends, but we cannot change the neighbours.”“My Pakistani friends, why have strained relations, we are neighbours. If we had good relations, we would have given you more money than the IMF,” he added.Singh said while the Centre gives money to J&K for development, Pakistan has been misusing financial aid for a long time. “It seeks money from other countries to run a terrorism factory on its soil,” he added.He said India would crossover and respond if Pakistan carried out any terror attack on Indian soil. “Pakistan, which has used terrorism as a tool against India, has been isolated at international fora with some of its trusted allies too stepping back. Even Turkey, which used to support Pakistan, has not mentioned Kashmir at the UNGA,” he said.“Whenever we have investigated terror acts, we have found Pakistani involvement. Our successive govts have tried to make Pakistan understand that they should stop terror camps but to no avail. Pakistan is frustrated after the revocation of Article 370 in Kashmir and is making attempts to revive the days of terror. They do not want democracy to take root here. India is strong enough to take on Pakistan on its soil,” he said.Reiterating the promises made in the BJP’s election manifesto, Singh said, “As the defence minister, I assure you that if (BJP candidate) Faqeer Mohammad Khan wins, more people from Gurez will be recruited in the Indian Army.”","Rajnath Singh said India would have given a larger bailout package to Pakistan than that sought by Islamabad from IMF.

How Nasrallah reshaped Hezbollah into Israel's archenemy



Nasrallah and his support for Palestinian cause



Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah was killed by the Israeli forces in an airstrike , the Israel Defense Forces said on Saturday, hours after strikes on Hezbollah headquarters.""Hassan Nasrallah will no longer be able to terrorize the world,” the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) declared following an airstrike in Beirut ’s southern suburbs.IDF spokesperson Nadav Shoshani confirmed Nasrallah’s death on X, stating, ""Hassan Nasrallah is dead.""Earlier reports indicated that Nasrallah had been the target of Israeli strikes carried out on Friday, which also targeted Hezbollah’s underground headquarters in the area.The Israeli military stated that a strike targeting Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut resulted in numerous deaths and injuries.Israeli airstrikes destroyed six buildings in the southern suburb of Harek Hreik in Beirut on Friday, marking the most significant strike in the Lebanese capital during nearly a year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah headed Hezbollah for over three decades, making it one of the most powerful militant groups in the middle east.Born in 1960 into a struggling Shiite family, he pursued theological studies and became involved with the Amal movement, a Shiite political and paramilitary organization, before emerging as one of the founders of Hezbollah.In 1985, Hezbollah formally declared its formation by releasing an ""open letter"" that named the US and the Soviet Union as Islam's main enemies. The letter also called for the ""obliteration"" of Israel, which it accused of occupying Muslim territories, BBC reported.The US designated Hezbollah a terrorist organisation in 1997, five years after Nasrallah was chosen as its secretary-general.Hezbollah was established by members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard who arrived in Lebanon during the summer of 1982 to combat the invading Israeli forces.Under Nasrallah's leadership, Hezbollah played a pivotal role in the war of attrition that resulted in the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon in 2000, ending an 18-year occupation.In 2006, Hezbollah engaged Israel in a 34-day conflict that ended in a stalemate, which he declared as ""divine victory.""A day after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on October 7, Hezbollah launched attacks on Israeli military posts along the border, labeling it a “backup front” for Gaza.""We are here paying the price for our front of support for Gaza, and for the Palestinian people, and our adoption of the Palestinian cause,"" Nasrallah said in a speech on August 1.Throughout the conflict, Hezbollah's leader has claimed that the group's cross-border strikes have diverted Israeli forces that would otherwise focus on Hamas in Gaza. He said that Hezbollah would not cease its attacks until a cease-fire is achieved in the region.As tensions escalated in recent weeks, Israel announced a new phase in the conflict aimed at pushing Hezbollah back from the border, allowing thousands displaced from northern Israel to return home.This escalation included strikes that resulted in the deaths of top Hezbollah military commanders and were linked to the destruction of numerous communications devices, including pagers used by the group, leading to 37 fatalities and thousands of injuries.(This is a top story on Google Trends)","Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah was killed by the Israeli forces in an airstrike, the Israel Defense Forces said on Saturday.

The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Two Meitei youths who had been missing for two days after attending a recruitment test for central security forces at New Keithelmanbi in Imphal West district of Manipur were allegedly abducted by Kuki militants .CM N Biren Singh posted Sunday on social media that his govt is “focusing on the rescue of the abduction of two innocent youths by Kuki militants”. Their disappearance near Kangpokpi , a Kuki-majority area, has heightened concerns that they may have accidentally crossed into Kuki territory.CM Singh held a meeting with both governing and opposition MLAs to discuss the situation. “…We condemn such heinous acts and our government is working to secure the safe release of the victims,” he wrote on his ‘X’ handle.The missing youths, identified as Oinam Thoithoi Singh and Thokchom Thoithoiba Singh, are from Thoubal district .Official sources said a third youth named Ningombam Johnson Singh, who had been part of the same group, has been rescued and is now safe after being handed over to police by central forces. Efforts are underway to locate the remaining two.Meitei groups believe that the youths lost their way. A Joint Action Committee (JAC) formed to demand their release filed a missing report with Thoubal district commissioner Saturday. They explained that the youths had attended a physical test for SSC (GD) recruitment at New Keithelmanbi on Friday and may have taken the wrong path, leading them to Kangpokpi.Since Friday, all attempts to contact the duo on their mobile phones have failed. A video has since surfaced showing the two youths pleading for help. “As a Meitei, we would appeal to pabung Biren (CM Singh). If you consider us as your sons, please save our lives. We request pabung Biren to please fulfil their demands at the earliest.

The Israeli military announced on Friday morning that it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen , as its ongoing strikes on Hezbollah in Lebanon intensified fears of a broader Middle East conflict .Sirens blared across central Israel, with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirming the missile's origin. ""The missile that was fired from Yemen was successfully intercepted by the 'Arrow' Aerial Defense System,"" the IDF said via Telegram.""Sirens and explosions were heard following the interception and falling shrapnel.""The IDF added that the missile was downed ""outside the country’s borders.""There were no direct impacts from the debris, but the Magen David Adom ambulance service reported that a 17-year-old girl was moderately injured when a car struck her as it pulled to the side of the road during the alert. She was conscious and taken to a hospital, while another 17 people were lightly injured from falls or due to anxiety while rushing to shelters, according to The Times of Israel.Earlier Thursday, Abdul Malik al-Huthi, the leader of Yemen's Huthi rebels, declared in a televised address that his Iran-backed group ""will not hesitate to support Lebanon and Hezbollah"" as clashes between the Lebanese militant group and Israel escalated.The Huthis have also targeted Red Sea shipping with over 220 ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones since November, framing these actions as solidarity with Palestinians amid the Gaza war, which erupted following Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.Amid these developments, Israel rejected a US-led push for a 21-day ceasefire in Lebanon. Israeli officials vowed to continue military operations, stating that they would fight Hezbollah ""until victory.""","Sirens blared across central Israel, with the Israel Defense Forces confirming the missile's origin.

Kamala Harris: 'My crowds are pretty big': Kamala Harris mocks Trump during fundraiser,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/my-crowds-are-pretty-big-kamala-harris-mocks-trump-during-fundraiser/articleshow/113799476.cms,"File photo: US Vice-President and Democratic Presidential candidate Kamala Harris (Picture credit: Reuters)

Vice President Kamala Harris took a jab at Republican frontrunner Donald Trump during a high-profile fundraiser on Sunday, boasting about the large crowds she draws as she campaigns across the country, reported the news agency AP.She also aimed to reinforce her support in battleground states like Arizona and Nevada, as she then went to Nevada for a rally at the same location where Trump spoke two weeks prior.Trump has been actively criticising her in these states, especially on immigration.Harris knows that the stakes are high but she also acknowledged the margins to be low. She called it a “margin-of-error” race, but confidently added, “The election is here, and let me be clear. We are going to win.""Harris quipped to the audience, “My crowds are pretty big,” as she prepared to speak in Nevada, at the same venue where Trump had held a rally earlier. During the presidential debate, Harris appeared to get under Trump's skin by pointing out that people were leaving his rallies early due to his rambling speeches. She has continued with this line of attack on the campaign trail.Her four-day West Coast trip combined campaign fundraising in California with stops in battleground states, shows that the race to the White House is going to be a close one.Harris’s visit to the US-Mexico border in Douglas, Arizona, her first since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, was likely intended to address immigration. Trump has spent days attacking her, claiming she would allow a border ""invasion"" and lead to lawlessness.Harris brushed off his accusations, responding, “We just see the same old tired show from the same old tired playbook,” as some in the audience shouted ""boring!"" in agreement.Notably, the star-studded fundraiser, which was held in Los Angeles , featured performances by Halle Bailey and Alanis Morissette and was attended by celebrities like Stevie Wonder, Keegan-Michael Key, Sterling K. Brown, Demi Lovato, and Jessica Alba. Harris has also been gaining Republican support, with former Arizona Sen Jeff Flake endorsing her, praising her “fine character and love of country.”Flake joins other anti-Trump Republicans, such as Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz, in backing Harris. However, Maryland Senate candidate Larry Hogan, another critic of Trump, said Harris has yet to earn his vote, although Trump won’t receive his support either.In Nevada, where Harris held a rally Sunday night, she highlighted her promise to eliminate federal taxes on tips for service industry workers, echoing a similar pledge made by Trump.However, Harris went further by promising to tackle the “sub-minimum wage” practice, where employers pay workers lower salaries and rely on tips to meet wage requirements. Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer of Nevada's Culinary Union , said, “That shows us she's serious.”Harris will return to Nevada on October 10 for a town hall with Hispanic voters, further emphasising the importance of the state’s six electoral votes in an election that is expected to be exceedingly close. Both she and Trump have made frequent visits to Nevada, which shows its significance in the race for the White House.","US Vice-President Kamala Harris took a jab at Republican frontrunner Donald Trump during a high-profile fundraiser on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: US President Joe Biden was asked by reporters on Sunday if he believes that an all-out war in the Middle East needs to be avoided. Tensions have escalated in the Middle East as Israel 's conflict with Hamas has now moved to Lebanon's Hezbollah .Biden on Sunday told reporters that the possibility of an all-out war 'has to' be avoided. While boarding Air Force One, Biden said, ""It has to be.We really have to avoid it.""This statement followed Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon, which resulted in numerous casualties as well as the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, that has potentially brought the possibility of pulling both Iran and US directly into the conflict.The White House views Nasrallah's death as a significant setback for Hezbollah. At the same time, the administration has sought to tread carefully as it has tried to contain Israel ’s war with Hamas, which, like Hezbollah, is backed by Iran, from exploding into an all-out regional conflict.Biden indicated he plans to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, though he did not specify when.","US President Joe Biden was asked by reporters on Sunday if he believes an all- out war in the Middle East needs to be avoided.

JERUSALEM: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed a former rival, Gideon Saar , as a member of his Cabinet on Sunday, expanding his coalition and strengthening his hold on office. Under their agreement, Netanyahu said Saar would serve as a minister without portfolio and serve in the security cabinet, the body that oversees the management of the ongoing war against Israel 's enemies across the Middle East.Saar (57) had hoped to replace defence minister Yoav Gallant, another rival of Netanyahu's. But a deal to become defence minister fell through several weeks ago after fighting intensified with Hezbollah along Israel's northern border, leaving the popular Gallant in office for the time being.Saar has had a strained relationship with the prime minister. He was once a rising star in Netanyahu's Likud party but angrily left it four years ago after accusing the prime minister of turning it into a ""cult of personality"" as he battled corruption charges.Since then, however, Saar has struggled as leader of a small conservative party, enjoying little support with the broader public. While he and Netanyahu have little love for one another, they share a hard-line ideology toward Israel's Arab adversaries.In recent months, Saar has said Israel must fight until Hamas is destroyed. He also has called for tougher action against Hezbollah's sponsor, Iran. And like Netanyahu, he strongly opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state .In a joint statement, they said they had put their differences aside for the good of the nation.Netanyahu's decision appears to have been driven in part by domestic politics.He faces a number of key political battles in the coming weeks -- including the contentious issue of drafting ultra-Orthodox men into the army, passing a budget and taking the stand in his long-running corruption trial. Saar is expected to help Netanyahu on many of these issues.His appointment also will likely scale back the influence of ultranationalist members of his coalition. Bezalel Smotrich, the Israeli finance minister, and Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel's minister of national security, are religious ideologues who have threatened to bring down the government if Netanyahu makes too many concessions in any cease-fire deal. Ben-Gvir has also drawn international criticism for provocative visits to a contested Jerusalem holy site.Sunday's agreement gives Saar, who hopes to be prime minister one day, an opportunity to revive his political career, while expanding Netanyahu's majority coalition to 68 seats in the 120-seat parliament.","Gideon Saar will serve as a minister without portfolio and serve in the security cabinet.

"Florida Doctor: Staff left 'shocked' as Florida surgeon mistakenly removes liver instead of spleen, leading to fatality",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/staff-left-shocked-as-florida-surgeon-mistakenly-removes-liver-instead-of-spleen-leading-to-fatality/articleshow/113790017.cms,"A Florida doctor had his medical licence suspended after being accused of mistakenly removing a patient's liver instead of the spleen, resulting in the ""immediate and catastrophic death"" of a 70-year-old Alabama man, according to the New York Post. The doctor, Thomas J. Shaknovsky, was found to have made “repeated egregious surgical errors” and allegedly falsified medical records to cover up the fatal mistake, according to an emergency order filed on September 24 by Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo.The incident occurred on August 21 at Ascension Sacred Heart Emerald Coast Hospital, where William Bryan was admitted after experiencing severe abdominal pain while on holiday with his wife in Miramar Beach. Imaging revealed an enlarged spleen, and despite initially refusing surgery , Bryan eventually agreed to undergo a splenectomy after Dr Shaknovsky insisted on him.Hospital members doubted Shaknovsky’s ability to perform complex surgery, as the team operated with a reduced “skeleton staff.” According to the surgeon general’s order, Shaknovsky began the procedure laparoscopically, surgical technique that uses specialised instruments to treat conditions in the abdomen or pelvis, but quickly converted to an open operation because of poor visibility caused by Bryan’s “distended colon and blood in the abdomen.” However, Shaknovsky failed to document this decision properly.Shaknovsky then reportedly began dissecting what he believed to be the spleen but instead was handling the liver. The doctor is said to have severed multiple ligaments attached to the liver, “that’s scary,” he said, after he felt a pulse under his finger. He then fired a surgical stapler into a vessel, causing a haemorrhage that sent Bryan into cardiac arrest.Operating room staff began emergency efforts, performing CPR and suctioning blood, but while the team worked to save Bryan, Shaknovsky continued to dissect the liver, eventually removing the organ, which weighed 4.6 pounds. Witnesses said that Shaknovsky insisted it was the spleen, leaving staff “shocked” and “sick to their stomachs.”Shaknovsky claimed Bryan died of a splenic artery aneurysm. He reportedly pressured staff to label the removed liver as a spleen and send it to pathology. The order further noted that Shaknovsky returned to the operating room three times, each time reiterating his assertion that Bryan had died of a splenic artery aneurysm.Surgeon general Ladapo condemned Shaknovsky’s actions, “Each attachment severed was another opportunity for Dr Shaknovsky to recognise he was handling the wrong organ,” Ladapo said.Bryan’s death has been ruled a homicide , and his family is expected to file a malpractice lawsuit.","Dr Thomas J.

Trump says Harris is 'mentally impaired' and should be disqualified,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-says-kamala-is-mentally-impaired-and-should-be-disqualified/articleshow/113789366.cms,"WASHINGTON: The US Presidential elections took an ugly and ominous turn this weekend with MAGA Supremo Donald Trump calling Democratic candidate Kamala Harris ""mentally impaired"" and demanding she be disqualified for letting in foreign criminals into the country to win the elections.Trump made a series of wild and unsubstantiated charges at a rally in Wisconsin and a college football game he attended in Alabama, doubling down on his racist rhetoric and taking US political discourse into unchartered territory.'Joe Biden became mentally impaired. Kamala was born that way...And if you think about it only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to happen to our country,"" Trump told a fanboy interviewer who egged him on the sidelines of a game where spectators gave him a raucous reception when he was shown on the jumbotron.The Harris campaign in turn trolled him with an ad that called him a ""loser"" for running away from a second debate after he self-destructed in the first, which he maintains he won. Bad weather reportedly thwarted an airplane banner that was to carry the message ""Trump’s Punting on 2nd Debate"" over one of the biggest college football games involving Georgia and Alabama that attracted over 100,000 spectators.Trump has previously called Harris ""crazy,"" ""nuts"" and ""dumb as a rock,"" and endorsed allegations that she is successful only because she slept her way to the top. He has claimed that the Jamaican-Indian origin vice president conveniently adopted a black heritage recently for electoral gains.But his latest line of attack suggesting that she should not be allowed to run on grounds of mental disability, coming amid growing legal challenges to the poll process in places where Democrats are expected to win, marks sinister turn in the most fractious US election in modern history.Trump's ramped up attack on Harris, including personal denigration, was triggered by new data purportedly provided by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official to a Republican lawmaker, revealing more than 650,000 non-citizens with criminal history, including more than 13,000 individuals accused or convicted of homicide, are currently in the US. The data did not say when or from how far back the alleged criminals came in or how the purported criminality was determined.“As of July 21, 2024, there were 662,566 noncitizens with criminal histories on ICE’s national docket —13,099 criminally convicted MURDERS. Americans deserve to be SAFE in our own communities,"" Congressman Tony Gonzales, who represents a border district in Texas, tweeted.But Trump and his MAGA cohorts are going with the narrative that the Biden-Harris administration is willfully bringing in criminals from across the world to ""destroy America"" and win the elections despite little evidence that illegal immigrants, much less criminals, are being registered to vote.Trump himself has become more graphic in the language he is using, ostensibly to put fear into American voters. ""They will walk into your kitchen, they'll cut your throat,...they will rape, pillage, thieve, plunder and kill,"" he foamed.The ICE data was made public just before Harris went to visit the border in Arizona to make the case that having staunched the migrant crossing from Mexico, she will get tougher on the border issue, and it is Trump who is sabotaging it for electoral gains. She has repeatedly said Trump wants to run on a problem rather than work toward a solution, pointing to the former President spiking immigration and border legislation proposed by lawmakers from the Republican Party.Trump has denied killing the legislation even though Republican lawmakers have publicly confirmed this and Trump himself boasted having done so. His effort to pin the illegal immigration issue on Harris, demonize immigrants, otherize her as an outsider, and try and disqualify her is also transparent.“Nobody who has allowed this to happen to our Country is fit to be President of the United States! Bad timing for her to show up to the Border today, after not going for four years. Why didn’t she release these numbers earlier?” Trump asked, as the MAGA echo-chamber went into overdrive with the new data. Rightwing commentators accused the liberal media of downplaying the data, amid questions from the latter about its authenticity and the timing of the release, which appeared to indicate a political divide even among immigration officials.","Trump made a series of wild and unsubstantiated charges at a rally in Wisconsin and a college football game he attended in Alabama.

ISLAMABAD: At least 64 people have been killed this week in a fresh outbreak of violence involving the Pashtun Sunni and Shia tribes of Pakistan 's militancy-prone Kurram district along the Afghanistan border in the northwest, where a ceasefire had been signed just over a month ago.Governor Faisal Karim Kundi of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said dozens on either side were wounded in the fighting, which continued Friday amid reports of higher casualties than the official figure.Police said the clashes started after the Boshehra Shias of upper Kurram started setting up bunkers on land belonging to the Sunni Ahmadzai community last week. The dispute quickly engulfed other areas and became a full-blown sectarian conflict , they said.In Aug, the warring sides signed a truce after clashes resulted in 50 deaths and injuries to over 200 people.Security officials said the renewed fighting led to closure of roads, triggering a shortage of food, medicines and fuel. Educational institutions have also remained shut for a week.Kurram, a mountainous area that shares a long border with Afghanistan, is home to about 700,000 people, of which more than 42% belong to the Shia community. The district's Parachinar town is one of the few Shia-dominated areas in largely Sunni Pakistan. The region has seen frequent tribal and sectarian clashes in recent years.","At least 64 people killed in fresh outbreak of violence involving Pashtun Sunni and Shia tribes of Pakistan's militancy-prone Kurram district.

According to police, the clashes started over a land dispute despite the efforts of the government and tribal elders to calm down the situation.""So far, 36 people have been killed and 80 others injured in clashes during last six days,"" police said.Locals, however, claimed much higher casualty figures.The fighting spread to areas such as Balishkhel, Sadda, Khar Kallay, Peewar and Maqbal in the district, which borders Afghanistan's Khost, Paktia, Logar and Nangarhar provinces, which are considered strongholds of the ISIS and the Pakistan Taliban.In July, at least 50 people were killed and more than 225 injured in week-long clashes between Boshehra and Maleekhel tribes in the same region.A jirga (tribal council) consisting of tribal elders from both sides met with the Deputy Inspector General of Police and Commissioner Kohat to contain the clashes, without much success.The violent clashes entered their sixth consecutive day on Thursday, with fresh exchanges of heavy gunfire across Upper, Lower, and Central tehsils, resulting in six more fatalities and ten injuries.According to police, both sides continue targeting each other with small and large weapons. The intensity of the fighting has led to the closure of the Parachinar-Peshawar main road and the Pak-Afghan Kharlachi border, disrupting transportation and movement.The road blockade has caused a shortage of essential items, including food, fuel, and medicines, worsening the situation for residents. Both private and public schools in the affected areas, including Parachinar City, have been closed for six days.Deputy Commissioner Javedullah Mehsud said that efforts are ongoing for a ceasefire, with district administration, police, military leadership, and tribal elders working together to bring peace to the region. He said that the Jirga members had been dispatched to different areas to talk with stakeholders.Meanwhile, the Kurram Bar Association has moved a local court over the frequent tribal clashes and lawlessness, which has made the lives of the common people miserable.Kurram, a mountainous area in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that shares a long border with Afghanistan, has witnessed deadly conflicts among tribes and religious groups as well as sectarian clashes and militant attacks in the past.The fighting in July turned into sectarian skirmishes and spread to other areas, including Peewar, Tangi, Balishkhel, Khaar Kalay, Maqbal, Kunj Alizai, Para Chamkani, and Karman. It stopped after the two sides agreed on a peace agreement brokered by Jirga leaders.","At least 36 people have been killed and 80 others injured in clashes between two warring tribes over a piece of land.
