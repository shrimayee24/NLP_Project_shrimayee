"Seek nod for Friday sermon topics, waqf board tells Chhattisgarh imams",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/seek-nod-for-friday-sermon-topics-waqf-board-tells-chhattisgarh-imams/articleshow/115395361.cms,"'I've issued order on WhatsApp'

RAIPUR: The Chhattisgarh Waqf board in a bid to let mosques in the state stay clear of controversy and undertake an image makeover has directed all Mutawallis (caretakers) at mosques and imams to seek approval on the topic of sermons to be delivered before the prayers every Friday. A circular to this effect was issued by the board on Sunday""Yes, Chhattisgarh is first state to have taken such a decision because mosques have become a centre of politics where Mutawallis serve and impose their own political will and inclination on people by issuing 'fatwa' about whom to vote and not. This leads to disturbing the communal harmony in the society. The decision for approval on subjects of sermons to be sought for, is purely legal and as per the Waqf Act,"" Salim Raj , Chhattisgarh Waqf Board chairman told TOI.Raj announced the decision during his visit to Jagdalpur where he had gone to look into the alleged financial irregularities being committed at mosques by Mutawallis. He added that as per the Waqf Act, Mutawallis' job and the meaning of this word is 'caretaker' of the mosque and they are supposed to be confined to their work as a caretaker, instead of indulging in other activities that disturb peace and communal harmony.""I have issued the order on a WhatsApp group as of now and will officially send it to all Mutawallis in mosques of the state. A mosque is a religious place of prayer and worship, not a political adda. The Jumma Namaz (Friday sermon) speeches should not have any political inclination or discussion or deliverance. The mosques should confine themselves to religious sermons and not a source of issuing fatwas for and against political parties,"" said Raj.The order will be effective from the coming Friday (November 22) across all mosques in the state, he said. There are several complaints of financial irregularities by Mutawallis while many of them have never presented accounts since 1997, Raj said, adding that he's going to lodge FIRs against such offenders soon.Reacting to the decision, Asaduddin Owaisi took to X stating, ""The Waqf Board of the BJP government in Chhattisgarh wants that before delivering the Friday sermon, the Khatib should get his sermon checked by the Waqf Board and should not deliver the sermon without the permission of the Board. Now the BJP people will tell us what is Deen (path)? Now do we have to take permission from them to follow our Deen? The Waqf Board does not have any such legal power, even if it had, it would still be against Article 25 of the Constitution.""",The Chhattisgarh Waqf board has directed all Mutawallis (caretakers) at mosques and imams to seek approval on the topic of sermons to be delivered before the prayers every Friday. The order will be effective from the coming Friday (November 22) across all mosques in the state.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115395526,imgsize-1125316,width-400,resizemode-4/115395526.jpg"

Pentagon in turmoil: Trump reportedly plans to fire senior military leaders who prioritized DEI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pentagon-in-turmoil-trump-reportedly-plans-to-fire-senior-military-leaders-who-prioritized-dei/articleshow/115339026.cms,"Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

The incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump is developing plans to dismiss senior military officers who prioritized diversity, equity, and inclusion ( DEI ) initiatives over combat preparedness, according to a Breitbart report citing sources familiar with the matter.The report said that President-elect Trump’s transition team is compiling a list of such officers. An executive order is reportedly being drafted to establish a panel that would recommend specific individuals for removal.“This is for real. This [EO] has made the cut,” said one source, who noted that revisions and consultations with incoming Pentagon leadership are still underway.Retired lieutenant colonel Pete Chambers and retired chief warrant officer 2 Samuel Shoemate, both known for their previous criticisms of DEI initiatives within the military, are reportedly assisting with the effort.The proposed dismissals are said to target officers who allegedly prioritized DEI initiatives at the expense of combat readiness .“They want to lop off the head of the Marxist snake. And so that’s the primary criteria that I’m trying to focus on,” Shoemate said in an interview.The initiative aims to refocus the military’s priorities on combat readiness and national security.One source expressed uncertainty about the feasibility of such a large-scale dismissal. The other source indicated the focus would be on officers associated withgeneral Mark Milley , Trump's former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.This source said, ""Every single person that was elevated and appointed by Milley will be gone. There's a very detailed list of everybody that was affiliated with Milley. And they will all be gone.""The Joint Chiefs of Staff consist of the highest-ranking officers from each branch of the US military.The potential firings were revealed shortly after Trump named Fox News commentator and veteran Pete Hegseth as his pick for defense secretary. Hegseth has previously advocated for a significant overhaul of Pentagon leadership, stating in his book ""The War on Warriors"":""The next president of the United States needs to radically overhaul Pentagon senior leadership to make us ready to defend our nation and defeat our enemies. Lots of people need to be fired.""The source also indicated that Air Force general C Q Brown, Milley's successor, would likely be among those dismissed, according to the Breitbart report.While some question the necessity and potential disruption of such a move, particularly during ongoing global conflicts, one source suggested the Trump team views the Joint Chiefs of Staff as bloated and believes replacements are readily available.It remains unclear if the plans will be implemented or if Trump himself endorses them.","The incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump is developing plans to dismiss senior military officers who prioritized diversity, equity, and inclusion ( DEI ) initiatives over combat preparedness. An executive order is reportedly being drafted to establish a panel that would recommend specific individuals for removal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115339950,imgsize-871340,width-400,resizemode-4/115339950.jpg"
Benjamin Netanyahu's house targeted: Two flash bombs land at Israel PM's home garden,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/netanyahus-house-targeted-two-flash-bombs-land-at-israel-pms-home-garden/articleshow/115375778.cms,"Second Attack Near Netanyahu's House; Hezbollah Fires Rockets On Caesarea

Israel intensifies attacks

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's house was targeted Saturday, with two flash bombs landing in the garden of his residence in Caesarea.According to a joint statement from the police and Shin Bet, the flares landed in the courtyard of the property. Netanyahu and his family were not present during the incident.“This is a serious incident and a dangerous escalation,” the statement said, confirming that an investigation has been launched. Israeli President Isaac Herzog described the incident as deeply alarming, warning against growing violence in the public sphere. “I have spoken with the head of the Shin Bet and stressed the urgent need to identify and bring those responsible to justice,” Herzog said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.Defence minister Israel Katz also condemned the attack as crossing “all red lines.” Katz highlighted the dual threats faced by the Prime Minister, both from external adversaries like Iran and Hezbollah and, alarmingly, from within Israel itself.This incident follows a prior attack on Netanyahu’s residence in October, when a drone, claimed by the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, targeted the property. At the time, Netanyahu accused Hezbollah of attempting to assassinate him and his wife, vowing to continue the fight against Iran’s proxies. “We are going to win this war.”Hezbollah, which has been engaged in cross-border fire with Israeli forces, has escalated its activities in recent weeks. On the same day as the flare attack, a synagogue in Haifa was struck by a Hezbollah rocket barrage, injuring two people. The Israeli military reported intercepting several projectiles launched from Lebanon, but others hit northern towns, prompting air raid sirens across the region.Israeli forces intensified operations in southern Lebanon on Saturday as Hezbollah launched its largest wave of projectiles yet, marking a significant escalation in the conflict. The Israeli military reported that Hezbollah had fired approximately 80 projectiles, including rockets and mortars, from Lebanon into Israel by late evening.Israeli troops briefly advanced to a strategic hill in Chamaa, a southern Lebanese village, before retreating after clashes with Hezbollah fighters. Lebanese state media reported that Israeli forces destroyed several structures in the area.Israeli warplanes also struck key locations, including Beirut’s Dahiyeh suburb, a Hezbollah stronghold, and the port city of Tyre. These airstrikes reportedly killed civilians, including a family of six, and caused significant destruction across multiple regions.",Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's house was targeted Saturday.

Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday pledged to work with the incoming administration of US President-elect Donald Trump , highlighting the importance of maintaining stability in US-China relations His remarks came during a meeting with outgoing US President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum in Lima, Peru. This marked their first meeting in seven months, as both leaders addressed critical global issues, including trade disputes, cybercrimes, tensions over Taiwan , and the ongoing influence of Russia.Xi acknowledged the historical challenges between the two nations but reiterated China’s consistent aim of fostering a stable, healthy, and sustainable relationship with the US, adding that Beijing is ready to maintain communication, expand cooperation, and manage differences with the Trump administration. Biden noted the frank and candid nature of his discussions with Xi, highlighting the importance of dialogue even in times of disagreement.The meeting occurred amid heightened tensions, as Trump prepared to take office in two months. His campaign promises, including imposing 60% tariffs on Chinese imports under his “America First” trade agenda, have already caused unease in Beijing.Biden’s administration has attempted to manage multiple flashpoints in the relationship, including allegations of China-linked cyberattacks targeting US government communications, growing pressure on Taiwan, and Beijing’s support for Russia in the Ukraine conflict.Meanwhile, Taiwan’s leadership has been a source of contention, with reports of President Lai Ching-te planning sensitive stopovers in the US and former economy minister Lin Hsin-i inviting Biden to visit Taiwan, moves likely to provoke Beijing. China continues to view Taiwan as its territory, while the US remains its most significant international backer, supplying arms despite lacking formal diplomatic ties.Beijing’s economy has faced significant challenges due to US trade policies under Biden, including restrictions on investments in Chinese technology sectors like artificial intelligence and quantum computing, as well as export controls on advanced semiconductors. These measures have compounded domestic pressures, creating economic strains that loom large over bilateral discussions.As Xi outlined the potential paths forward, he stressed that mutual respect and cooperation could foster progress in the relationship, while antagonism and competition would risk setbacks.Xi’s visit to the Apec summit also marked a broader diplomatic push to expand China’s influence in Latin America, a region long dominated by US interests. During his trip, Xi signed a refurbished free-trade agreement with Peru, inaugurated the Chancay deep-water port, and announced plans to host the Apec summit in 2026.","Xi Jinping pledged to work with the incoming administration of US President- elect Donald Trump.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around. Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.The hip-hop mogul, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges, has been denied bail twice since his arrest in September.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Pete Hegseth , US President-elect Donald Trump 's pick for secretary of defense, who is facing criticism for his tattoos, broke his silence on Saturday regarding the controversy. He said that while he didn’t mind being targeted, he was determined to ensure that the media's targeting of Christians, conservatives, patriots, and everyday Americans would end on the first day at Trump 's department of defense.Hegseth, a Fox News host and Army National Guard veteran, has a Jerusalem Cross tattooed on his chest and Latin phrase ""Deus Vult,"" meaning ""God wills it,"" inked on his bicep, along with many other tattoos. Both the Jerusalem Cross and the phrase ""Deus Vult"" are associated with the Christian Crusades in the Middle East. These symbols are also considered by some to be common in Christian imagery. However, the ""Deus Vult"" tattoo has recently been linked by some to white supremacist groups, which is the primary reason for the controversy.Hegseth responded to the controversy following a social media post from newly-elected vice president JD Vance, who criticised the news agency Associated Press (AP) for 'attacking' the Fox News host over his tattoo and accused them of 'anti-Christian bigotry.'Hegseth echoed Vance’s statement about 'anti-Christian bigotry' on X, saying:""Amen @JDVance. Anti-Christian bigotry in the media on full display. They can target me — I don’t give a damn — but this type of targeting of Christians, conservatives, patriots and everyday Americans will stop on DAY ONE at DJT’s DoD.""Earlier, AP Pentagon correspondent Tara Copp had shared on X that Hegseth was flagged as a possible ""insider threat"" by a fellow service member due to his tattoo. She also provided a link to an AP report supporting the claim.Vance defended Hegseth, calling the AP's reporting ""disgusting anti-Christian bigotry.""“They're attacking Pete Hegseth for having a Christian motto tattooed on his arm. This is disgusting anti-Christian bigotry from the AP, and the entire organization should be ashamed of itself,” Vance wrote.According to Olivia Troye, a former White House homeland security and counterterrorism adviser, Hegseth was banned from National Guard duty at President Joe Biden's 2021 inauguration because military officials believed his tattoos might represent extremist symbols.","Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host and Army National Guard veteran, has a Jerusalem Cross tattooed on his chest and Latin phrase ""Deus Vult,"" meaning ""God wills it,"" inked on his bicep.

US Election 2024 Results: 'Nostradamus' Allan Lichtman blames Elon Musk after getting US election result wrong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nostradamus-allan-litchman-blames-elon-musk-after-getting-us-election-result-wrong/articleshow/115302097.cms,"Lichtman’s Prediction Shock



Inside the “Keys to the White House” Model



Concerns Over Democracy



Evaluating the Keys: A System Under Strain



Reflections on a Missed Prediction and Changing Political Dynamics



The Fragility of Democracy in the 21st Century



Allan Lichtman , often referred to as the ""Nostradamus"" of US Presidential Polls, has attributed his incorrect prediction—suggesting Vice President Kamala Harris would win the US election—to disinformation and billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk. Lichtman, renowned for his accurate forecasting of nine out of the last ten US elections, had correctly predicted nine out of ten election outcomes. However, last week, the historian and political scientist’s prediction that Kamala Harris would win the US Presidential election proved incorrect, with Republican Donald Trump returning to the White House.Speaking with News Nation, Allan Lichtman, a professor at American University, elaborated on the reasons for his incorrect forecast, citing conservative media platforms and Elon Musk, who reportedly invested millions in Donald Trump’s campaign, as contributing factors. Lichtman also criticised Musk for amplifying disinformation online on topics such as immigration, hurricane relief, and the war in Ukraine, ""tipping the scales,"" as the News Nation report noted.“Disinformation is the primary issue,” Lichtman stated during an appearance on Chris Cuomo’s NewsNation show. “We’ve always had disinformation, but it’s now reached unprecedented levels. Much of the grievances this election were fuelled by it.” He continued, “Scholars have shown that when truth dissolves, democracy follows. Authoritarian regimes take hold not through force but through the manipulation of information, as George Orwell warned in 1984, where war is peace and famine is plenty.”""The basis of my system, the Keys to the White House, is that a rational, pragmatic electorate assesses if the governing party deserves another four years. But when disinformation drives the electorate's view of that party, especially from individuals with immense financial influence, perhaps the foundation of the Keys needs re-evaluation,"" Lichtman concluded.For over forty years, Allan Lichtman has used his ""Keys to the White House"" model with remarkable accuracy, having correctly predicted every presidential winner since 1984. The 77-year-old American University professor was confident that Kamala Harris would win the 2024 election, with his model’s indicators pointing towards a Democratic victory. However, as the results confirmed Trump’s sweeping win, Lichtman found himself blindsided, live-streaming his disbelief with his son, Sam. The political forecaster was left questioning what had gone wrong, joking, “Good thing I’ve nothing on tomorrow. No interviews for me.”American historian Allan Lichtman, often dubbed the ""Nostradamus of US elections,"" was left speechless when his prediction of Kamala Harris’ victory in the 2024 US Presidential Elections was proven incorrect. Lichtman and his son, Sam, hosted a six-hour YouTube livestream, during which he expressed his bewilderment, saying, “I don’t get it,” as Trump moved steadily towards a victory.Visibly tired and disappointed by the outcome, Lichtman remarked, “Good thing I’ve nothing to do tomorrow. And I’m not doing any interviews.” He added, “The democracy is gone.” Meanwhile, battles in Nevada, North Carolina, and Arizona remained “too close to call.”Reflecting on the state of democracy, Lichtman noted, “Once democracy is gone, it’s almost impossible to recover. The way to recover is by dictators losing wars.” On 6 November, Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump clinched a historic victory, surpassing the majority required to defeat Kamala Harris. Trump celebrated the outcome as a “magnificent victory for the American people,” thanking his supporters.Lichtman expressed his frustration, hoping that Trump would serve his term and that “we never have to deal with him again.” He struggled to comprehend “how that many people can just ignore all the stuff he did in 2020,” describing Trump as “too lazy to govern the country.” Wrapping up the livestream, Lichtman urged, “Democracy is precious, but like all precious things, it can be destroyed. And typically destroyed from within. Throughout the 21st century, democracy has been in decline globally, and America has now joined that trend. But never give up hope. Never stop striving. Never stop trying, especially you young people.”For more than four decades, Lichtman’s ""Keys to the White House"" model has enjoyed a strong track record of accuracy, correctly predicting each presidential winner since 1984. The 77-year-old American University professor expected Harris to win in 2024, relying on the model’s indicators that favoured a Democratic outcome. But Trump’s decisive victory left Lichtman surprised, live-streaming his dismay alongside his son, Sam.Lichtman’s prediction model, the ""13 Keys to the White House,"" is based on 13 true-or-false indicators that assess conditions favouring the incumbent party. If six or more of these keys turn “false,” the model predicts a loss for the incumbent. The keys encompass factors like economic performance, social stability, candidate charisma, and major policy achievements. Lichtman believed Harris had eight keys in her favour, while Trump fell short on several counts, pointing to a clear Democratic path to victory.In his forecast, Lichtman highlighted Harris’s strengths in areas like “No Primary Contest,” “Strong Long-term Economy,” and “No Foreign or Military Failures.” These indicators usually benefit the incumbent party when stable or positive. Yet, despite these favourable indicators, the electorate leaned unexpectedly towards Trump, leading to his decisive win. This miss by the ""Keys"" model underscores its limitations in capturing an increasingly unpredictable political climate.As the election results became evident, Lichtman’s initial disbelief turned into deeper concerns about democracy’s future. During the livestream, he lamented, “Oh, democracy’s gone,” voicing his fears of an era marked by the fragility of democratic institutions. His apprehensions went beyond his failed prediction, revealing a broader concern about the future of democratic governance, especially given Trump’s divisive leadership style and its impact on political norms.Lichtman pointed out that once democracy erodes, restoring it becomes a significant challenge. He referenced historical cases where authoritarian regimes ended only after substantial upheavals, like wars or social revolutions. His son, Sam, tried to reassure him, optimistically suggesting that Trump’s influence might diminish post-presidency. But Lichtman remained sceptical, warning that “Democracy is precious, but like all precious things, it can be destroyed.” He noted the troubling global trend of eroding democratic norms throughout the 21st century.Since its creation, Lichtman’s model has been celebrated as a strong alternative to traditional polling, which often misses subtle shifts in voter sentiment. Developed from a study of presidential elections from 1860 to 1980, the ""Keys to the White House"" model aimed to cut through polling noise and focus on the broader factors that shape elections. The model’s 13 true/false questions support or oppose the incumbent’s chances, with “true” answers favouring the incumbent party. Key factors include economic stability, absence of scandals, and whether the challenger is charismatic.Below are some key indicators that Lichtman considered crucial:Party Mandate – Incumbents often gain an advantage if they hold a strong congressional majority after midterms.No Primary Contest – Indicates party unity, favouring the incumbent.Strong Long-term Economy – If the economy shows steady growth, it generally supports the incumbent.No Social Unrest – A stable social environment benefits the incumbent.No Scandal – Absence of scandals maintains public trust.Uncharismatic Challenger – This benefits the incumbent if the challenger lacks charisma.In 2024, Lichtman assessed that Harris had eight keys in her favour, indicating a Democratic win. However, the result suggests that underlying political and social dynamics were more complex than the model could capture.With Trump’s victory now a reality, Lichtman’s rare error may highlight how shifting political dynamics affect the reliability of traditional forecasting. Modern elections increasingly present unexpected factors, like disinformation, polarisation, and changing voter loyalty. While historically insightful, Lichtman’s model may face challenges in adapting to the electorate’s evolving motivations.Additionally, the 2024 election was marked by heightened emotion and intense division across party lines. Trump’s divisive but impactful rhetoric appealed to many voters disillusioned with the status quo. Although Harris appeared to have the advantage, voter sentiment ultimately leaned towards a familiar figure promising change, despite his controversial approach.For Lichtman, the 2024 result symbolises more than a missed prediction. His comments on democracy’s precarious state underscore a broader concern: that American democracy, like others worldwide, is under strain. Rising polarisation, erosion of institutional norms, and the spread of populism have altered the landscape. Lichtman worries these trends could destabilise democracy if left unchecked.The historian’s warnings echo broader anxieties about the potential consequences of leadership that disregards democratic values. He urged vigilance, reminding those who value democracy not to lose hope. While democracy is fragile, it can also be resilient—if people remain committed to protecting it.In uncertain times, Lichtman’s insights remind us that no model is infallible, but the continued pursuit of truth, transparency, and democratic values is essential. As he concluded, “Never give up hope.” This sentiment transcends his prediction, offering a hopeful message to those committed to upholding democracy in an unpredictable world.","Allan Lichtman, often referred to as the ""Nostradamus"" of US Presidential Polls, has attributed his incorrect prediction to disinformation and billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk.

NEW DELHI: Manipur remains on high alert following violent protests sparked by the discovery of six bodies, including those of women and children, allegedly abducted and killed by militants in the Jiribam district. In response to escalating tensions, authorities imposed an indefinite curfew in multiple districts of Imphal Valley and suspended internet services to curb the spread of unrest. The discovery of the bodies, along with widespread protests, has prompted severe security measures, including the deployment of army and Assam Rifles personnel.On the morning of Sunday, November 17, piles of debris were found on roads in Imphal, a day after protesters ransacked the homes of three state ministers and six legislators. The violence saw agitators attack several residences, including that of chief minister N Biren Singh's son-in-law, BJP MLA R K Imo, and other prominent political figures. Security forces responded with tear gas to disperse crowds as violent protests continued throughout the valley.The violence erupted after six individuals, three women and three children, went missing from a relief camp in Jiribam following a gunfight between militants and security forces. The bodies were later found in two separate incidents: three bodies, including those of a woman and two children, were discovered near the confluence of the Jiri and Barak rivers, while the remaining bodies were recovered on Saturday. The discovery has led to widespread protests, with angry demonstrators targeting the homes of local politicians and public representatives.The Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity (COCOMI) has demanded military action against the militants responsible for the deaths, within 24 hours. The group also called for the repeal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), which was reimposed in several districts earlier this month.""There have been reports of further arson and the burning of additional structures by miscreants, but these claims have not yet been independently verified,"" the officials told news agency PTI.Union home minister Amit Shah canceled his scheduled election rallies in Maharashtra and returned to Delhi due to the escalating situation in Manipur, according to sources quoted by PTI. Shah was originally set to address rallies in Gadchiroli, Wardha, Katol, and Saoner as part of the ongoing election campaign in the state.Elections in Maharashtra are scheduled for November 20, with results to be announced on November 23.In response to the escalating violence, a total curfew has been imposed in Imphal East, West, Bishnupur, Thoubal, and Kakching districts of Imphal Valley. The curfew was enforced after violent protests and attacks on political figures' residences.Authorities have temporarily suspended internet services across seven districts, including Imphal West and East, to prevent the spread of inflammatory content and to maintain law and order.Protesters attacked the homes of several MLAs, including those of the chief minister’s son-in-law and BJP legislator R K Imo, as well as ministers such as Sapam Ranjan, L Susindro Singh, and Y Khemchand. The violence resulted in property damage and arson.In response to the unrest, heavy security forces, including the Army and Assam Rifles, have been deployed in Imphal. Flag marches have been conducted, and additional checkpoints have been set up across vulnerable areas.Manipur police arrested 23 individuals involved in the ransacking and arson of public figures' homes. Authorities have also recovered firearms, including a .32 pistol, and several mobile phones from those arrested.Miscreants set fire to at least two churches and three houses in Jiribam town, according to officials.Rahul Gandhi urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit Manipur and address the escalating violence. In a post on X, he said, ""The recent string of violent clashes and continuing bloodshed in Manipur is deeply disturbing. After more than a year of division and suffering, it was the hope of every Indian that the Central and State governments would have made every effort at reconciliation and found a solution. I urge the PM once again to visit Manipur and work towards restoring peace and healing in the region.""Mallikarjun Kharge accused the BJP of deliberately letting the violence in Manipur continue for political reasons. He posted on X, ""We are saying it with utmost responsibility that it looks that the BJP deliberately wants Manipur to burn, for it serves its hateful divisive politics."" He also criticized Prime Minister Modi's response to the crisis, saying, ""if you visit Manipur in future, people of the state will never forgive or forget that you left them to fend for themselves, and never set foot in their state to heal their miseries and find a solution."" He also pointed out the growing toll, adding, ""At least 17 people have lost their lives since November 7.""","Bodies of six people from the Meitei community were found, days after they were taken hostage by suspected Kuki insurgents from Manipur's Jiribam district. The discovery of the bodies, along with widespread protests, has prompted severe security measures, including the deployment of army and Assam Rifles personnel.

Music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs has allegedly attempted to contact potential witnesses from jail and sway public opinion to influence jurors in his upcoming sex trafficking trial, prosecutors claimed in a Friday court filing, urging the judge to deny his latest bail request .Combs, currently held in a Brooklyn detention center, faces charges of coercion and abuse of women over several years.Prosecutors, in the court documents, outlined Combs’ alleged efforts to manipulate witnesses and public opinion from jail, including orchestrating social media campaigns. They said that a review of recorded calls revealed Combs instructing family members to influence witnesses' narratives and discussing marketing strategies to shape public perception.""The defendant has repeatedly shown — even while in custody — that he will flout rules to improperly impact the outcome of his case,"" prosecutors stated in the filing, adding that he ""cannot be trusted to abide by conditions.""Prosecutors alleged that Combs' behavior indicates an intent to manipulate victims and witnesses, arguing that he may be attempting to coerce them into remaining silent or giving testimony favorable to his defense.Prosecutors further claimed that Diddy began violating rules shortly after his arrival at the prison following his arrest in September.According to prosecutors, Combs involved his children in his efforts, encouraging them to post a birthday tribute video on social media, which he then analyzed for its potential impact on jurors.These actions, prosecutors argued, justify his continued detention and demonstrate a pattern of witness intimidation and manipulation of the legal process.Despite two prior bail requests being denied, Combs’ lawyers recently filed a third proposal, citing new evidence. However, prosecutors maintain that his alleged attempts to influence witnesses reflect a continued disregard for legal proceedings.A bail hearing is scheduled for next week, with Combs’ trial set to begin on May 5.","Diddy faces charges of coercion and abuse of women over several years.

President Joe Biden announced major climate initiatives on Sunday during his historic visit to the Amazon rainforest, pledging an additional $50 million to Brazil's Amazon Fund and asserting that no future administration could reverse America’s progress on clean energy.Speaking from Manaus, the largest city in the Amazon, Biden described the fight against climate change as a cornerstone of his presidency. ""It’s true, some may seek to deny or delay the clean energy revolution that’s underway in America. But nobody, nobody can reverse it, nobody — not when so many people, regardless of party or politics, are enjoying its benefits,"" he declared.The pledge doubles the United States' total contribution to the fund, a key instrument for rainforest conservation, as Biden seeks to solidify his climate legacy before leaving office in January.The Amazon, often referred to as the “lungs of the world,” absorbs vast amounts of carbon dioxide, making its preservation critical in mitigating global warming.Biden's visit marked the first by a sitting US president to the Amazon and included meetings with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Indigenous leaders. Lula, who has vowed to end deforestation by 2030, welcomed Biden’s renewed commitment. The two leaders discussed collaborative efforts, including a newly launched bioeconomy coalition aiming to mobilise $10 billion by 2030 to restore degraded lands and boost eco-friendly development. Biden also highlighted US plans to channel $37.5 million into reforesting Brazil's grasslands and support Lula’s “Tropical Forest Forever Fund.”However, the significance of Biden’s visit is tempered by the looming inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged to roll back climate policies, expand fossil fuel production, and withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement. Critics fear Trump’s return could undermine Biden's climate achievements and halt pledged contributions to the Amazon Fund. Environmental experts, such as Suely Araújo from Brazil’s Climate Observatory, expressed doubts that the announced funds would materialise under a Trump administration.Biden’s tour of the Amazon included viewing fire damage and dried-up waterways caused by historic droughts, as well as interactions with Indigenous communities and scientists highlighting the rainforest's ecological importance. “This is not just Brazil’s responsibility but a global fight for humanity,” Biden said, urging continued international support for conservation efforts.","President Joe Biden announced major climate initiatives on Sunday during his historic visit to the Amazon rainforest.

More than 400 people were evacuated from the building.The rescuers were checking every apartment looking for people who might be still in the damaged building.""Every life destroyed by Russia is a big tragedy,"" said Klymenko.The drone and missile attack, which targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, came as fears are mounting about Moscow's intentions to devastate Ukraine's power generation capacity ahead of the winter.Also Sunday, President Joe Biden authorized for the first time the use of US-supplied long-range missiles by Ukraine to strike inside Russia, after extensive lobbying by Ukrainian officials.The weapons are likely to be used in response to North Korea's decision to send thousands of troops to support Russia in the Kursk region where Ukraine mounted a military incursion over the summer.It is the second time the US has permitted the use of Western weapons inside Russian territory within limits after permitting the use of HIMARS systems, a shorter-range weapon, to stem Russia's advance in Kharkiv region in May.The first reaction from Ukraine to the long-awaited decision from the US was notably restrained.""Today, much is being said in the media about us receiving permission for the relevant actions. But strikes are not made with words. Such things are not announced. The missiles will speak for themselves,"" said Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his nightly video address.Earlier, Zelenskyy said that Russia had launched a total of 120 missiles and 90 drones in a large-scale attack across Ukraine. Various types of drones were deployed, he said, including Iranian-made Shaheds, as well as cruise, ballistic and aircraft-launched ballistic missiles.Ukrainian defenses shot down 144 out of a total of 210 air targets, Ukraine's air force reported later on Sunday.""The enemy's target was our energy infrastructure throughout Ukraine. Unfortunately, there is damage to objects from hits and falling debris. In Mykolaiv, as a result of a drone attack, two people were killed and six others were injured, including two children,"" Zelenskyy said.Two more people were killed in the Odesa region, where the attack damaged energy infrastructure and disrupted power and water supplies, said local governor Oleh Kiper. Both victims were employees of Ukraine's state-owned power grid operator, Ukrenergo, the company said hours later.The combined drone and missile attack was the most powerful in three months, according to the head of Kyiv's City Military Administration, Serhii Popko.One person was injured after the roof of a five-story residential building caught fire in Kyiv's historic center, according to Popko.A thermal power plant operated by private energy company DTEK was ""seriously damaged,"" the company said.Russian strikes have hammered Ukraine's power infrastructure since Moscow's all-out invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, prompting repeated emergency power shutdowns and nationwide rolling blackouts. Ukrainian officials have routinely urged Western allies to bolster the country's air defenses to counter assaults and allow for repairs.Explosions were heard across Ukraine on Sunday, including in the capital, Kyiv, the key southern port of Odesa, as well as the country's west and central regions, according to local reports.The operational command of Poland's armed forces wrote on X that Polish and allied aircraft, including fighter jets, have been mobilized in Polish airspace because of the ""massive"" Russian attack on neighboring Ukraine. The steps were aimed to provide safety in Poland's border areas, it said.Russia's Defense Ministry on Sunday acknowledged carrying out a ""mass"" missile and drone attack on ""critical energy infrastructure"" in Ukraine, but claimed all targeted facilities were tied to Kyiv's military industry.Although Ukraine's nuclear plants were not directly impacted, several electrical substations on which they depend suffered further damage, the UN's nuclear energy watchdog said in a statement Sunday.

Mojtaba Khamenei , the second son of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei , has reportedly been chosen as his father’s successor during a secretive meeting of the Assembly of Experts , according to Israeli media outlet Ynet News, which cited a report by Iran International .The secret meeting, held on September 26, was convened at the request of the 85-year-old leader, who is reportedly battling health issues. The 60-member assembly allegedly faced significant pressure to reach a unanimous decision, including threats from Khamenei and his representatives.Mojtaba Khamenei’s growing influence within the regime has been evident over the past two years. While he has rarely appeared in public, he is recognized for his alleged role in suppressing the 2009 post-election protests. In 2021, he was granted the title of ayatollah, fulfilling the constitutional requirements for the role of Supreme Leader.The Iran International report suggests the decision was kept secret to avoid public backlash. ""The assembly resolved to maintain maximum secrecy over the decision due to fears of widespread public protests,"" it stated, adding that members were warned of severe consequences for any leaks.The reported decision highlights the regime's attempts to strengthen its control as it faces increasing internal and external pressures. The Iranian government has yet to respond to these claims.Sources cited in the report claim Khamenei plans to transfer power to his son while still alive to ensure a smooth transition and avoid opposition.Numerous social media posts circulated on Saturday, alleging that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has fallen into a coma. These claims gained traction shortly after a report by The New York Times in October stated that Khamenei is ""seriously ill.""

Three men were arrested and convicted in the killing. But after spending more than 20 years in prison, two of them - Muhammad A. Aziz and Khalil Islam - were exonerated. (The third, Thomas Hagan, was parolled in 2010.)Malcolm X rose to prominence in the Nation of Islam, the black nationalist group, and became an at times controversial but fiery leader. A year before his killing, he had left the Nation of Islam and started Organisation of Afro-American Unity.On February 21, 1965, as he began to speak about the new group, 3 gunmen rushed the stage and shot him in front of his pregnant wife and three of his daughters. He was 39. For decades, historians cast doubt on official accounts and on guilt of Aziz and Islam. A probe found in 2021 that prosecutors, police and FBI had withheld key evidence at the time.","Malcolm X was shot dead in front of his pregnant wife and three of his daughters in 1965.

"In a policy shift, Biden allows Ukraine to hit Russia with long-range US missiles",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/in-a-policy-shift-biden-allows-ukraine-to-hit-russia-with-long-range-us-missiles/articleshow/115398434.cms,"President Joe Biden has authorised the first use of US-supplied long-range missiles by Ukraine for strikes inside Russia, US officials said.The weapons are likely to be initially employed against Russian and North Korean troops in defence of Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region of western Russia, the officials said.Biden's decision is a major change in US policy. The choice has divided his advisers, and his shift comes two months before President-elect Trump takes office, having vowed to limit further support for Ukraine.Allowing the Ukrainians to use the long-range missiles, known as the Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, came in response to Russia's surprise decision to bring North Korean troops into the fight, officials said. Biden began to ease curbs on the use of US-supplied weapons on Russian soil after Russia launched a cross-border assault in May in the direction of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city.To help the Ukrainians defend Kharkiv, Biden allowed them to use the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, which have a range of about 50 miles (80km), against Russian forces directly across the border. But Biden did not allow the Ukrainians to use longer-range ATACMS, which have a range of about 190 miles (145km), in defence of Kharkiv.While the officials said they do not expect the shift to fundamentally alter the course of the war, one of the goals of the policy change, they said, is to send a message to the North Koreans that their forces are vulnerable and that they should not send more of them. The officials said that while the Ukrainians were likely to use the missiles first against Russian and North Korean troops that threaten Ukrainian forces in Kursk, Biden could authorise them to use the weapons elsewhere.Some US officials said they feared that Ukraine's use of the missiles across the border could prompt President Putin to retaliate with force against the US and its coalition partners. But other US officials said they thought those fears were overblown.The Russian military is set to launch a major assault by an estimated 50,000 soldiers, including North Korean troops, on dug-in Ukrainian positions in Kursk with the goal of retaking all of the Russian territory that the Ukrainians seized in Aug. The Ukrainians could use the ATACMS missiles to strike Russian and North Korean troop concentrations, key pieces of military equipment, logistics nodes, ammunition depots and supply lines deep inside Russia. Doing so could help the Ukrainians blunt the effectiveness of Russian-North Korean assault.Earlier, some Pentagon officials opposed giving ATACMS to the Ukrainians because they said the US army had limited supplies. Some White House officials feared that Putin would widen the war if they gave the missiles to the Ukrainians. Supporters of a more aggressive posture toward Moscow say Biden and his advisers have been too easily intimidated by Putin's hostile rhetoric.","Biden's decision is a major change in US policy.

Oklahoma superintendent Ryan Walters faces criticism over religious freedom video mandate in schools,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/oklahoma-superintendent-ryan-walters-faces-criticism-over-religious-freedom-video-mandate-in-schools/articleshow/115394692.cms,"Ryan Walters (Picture credit: X)

A top education official in the US state of Oklahoma is facing criticism after ordering public schools to show students a video promoting a new department of religious freedom and patriotism .State superintendent Ryan Walters , a Republican, announced the department on Wednesday, claiming it will address attacks on religious liberty and patriotism by “woke teachers' unions.” The new office will operate under the state's department of education.On Thursday, Walters emailed school superintendents demanding they show his video announcement to all students and send it to parents.“In one of the first steps of the newly created department, we are requiring all of Oklahoma schools to play the attached video to all kids that are enrolled,” the email read.In the video, Walters claims that religious liberty has been attacked and patriotism mocked ""by woke teachers unions ,"" before praying for US leaders.“In particular, I pray for President Donald Trump and his team as they continue to bring about change to the country,” Walters said in the video.He further said that students are not required to participate in the prayer.According to Walters , the new department will “oversee the investigation of abuses to individual religious freedom or displays of patriotism.”Two of Oklahoma's largest school districts, Edmond and Bixby, have said they will not show the video. Oklahoma City Public Schools is reviewing the matter.Oklahoma attorney general Gentner Drummond’s office declared Walters’ mandate unlawful.“Not only is this edict unenforceable, it is contrary to parents’ rights, local control, and individual free-exercise rights,” the statement read.This is not the first time Walters' actions have drawn legal challenges. He is currently facing two lawsuits over a June mandate requiring schools to incorporate the Bible into lesson plans for grades 5 through 12, a directive several districts have refused to follow.","Oklahoma state superintendent Ryan Walters announced a new department of religious freedom and patriotism on Wednesday.

Kamala Harris: Poll guru Nate Silver says Donald Trump's win is Biden's fault: 'Kamala got tough assignments',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/poll-guru-nate-silver-says-donald-trumps-win-is-bidens-fault-kamala-got-tough-assignments/articleshow/115393203.cms,"Kamala Harris was given tough assignments by Biden, poll guru Nate Silver wrote in his latest blog post.



If Biden contested against Donald Trump

Biden undermined her but Harris campaign did not criticize Biden



Kamala Harris is a replacement-level politician



Poll guru Nate Silver who was bashed for his wrong prediction of a neck-and-neck fight between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in the election said he has a lot of sympathy for Kamala Harris because she only got tough assignments from President Joe Biden . Biden gave her the border during the administration and then after it was Kamala Harris' race, Biden kept on stepping on her message.In his latest post-election blog post, Nate Silver who predicted a narrow win for Trump, wrote that the White House badmouthed Harris to reporters saying that she was a worse option than Biden.""When Biden dropped out, he was trailing Donald Trump by 4 points in our national polling average. I actually think the final margin would have gotten worse, not better. There would have been another debate and further campaign stumbles. Biden’s fundraising was completely drying up. And like Harris, Biden might have slightly underperformed his polls on Election Day. So I can see Biden losing by 6 to 8 points, probably losing New Hampshire — and maybe Virginia, New Mexico, Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, Minnesota and even New Jersey, where Harris prevailed by just 5.6 points,"" Nate wrote.Nate Silver said Harris's campaign comprising mostly ex-Biden people was reluctant to criticize Biden ""out of fear of being perceived as disloyal"" but Biden frequently undermined her.""The other big negative is Harris's strongly left-wing positions as a presidential candidate in 2019. She may have tried to pivot to the center in this campaign, but it was a clumsy effort at best given a lack of explanation for why she’d abandoned her previous positions or what her agenda would actually look like,"" Silver wrote.Silver wrote Kamala Harris has plenty of talent and sometimes and sometimes, replacement-level talent is good enough in a pinch. But this was a difficult electoral environment for Democrats.","Nate Silver said he has a lot of sympathy for Kamala Harris because she only got tough assignments from President Joe Biden.
