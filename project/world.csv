Pune’s Juvenile Justice Board extended the detention of the boy in a shelter home until June 12, following the state prosecution’s argument that there is no one to care for him as his parents and grandfather are in custody. In a related development, the district and sessions court deferred the hearing of bail pleas for the owner and manager of Cosie pub , and an assistant manager and bartender at Blak Marriott pub until June 10. They face charges of serving liquor to the minor before the accident. The court also postponed hearings for additional bail petitions filed by the teen’s father, grandfather, and a workforce consultant.

The boy’s mother was arrested on June 1 on the charge of giving her blood sample in place of her son’s for the alcohol test to determine if he was driving under the influence when the car fatally hit two engineers on a bike.

NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin has lashed out at the West for delivering long-range weapons to Ukraine , warning that Moscow might consider supplying similar arms to other nations to target Western interests.“If someone thinks it is possible to supply such weapons to a war zone to attack our territory and create problems for us, why don’t we have the right to supply our weapons,” Putin told a press conference in St Petersburg.His remarks followed confirmations from a US senator and a Western official that Ukraine recently used American weapons for strikes inside Russia .The weapons were deployed under new guidance from President Joe Biden , which permits American arms to be used for the defense of Kharkiv , Ukraine's second-largest city.Republican Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, confirmed the strikes using US weapons but did not disclose how he received this information.Biden's reported directives allows Ukrainian forces to use US-provided weapons against Russian forces that are either attacking or preparing to attack.However, it does not alter the existing US policy prohibiting the use of American-supplied Army Tactical Missile Systems (Atacms) or long-range missiles for offensive strikes inside Russia.Berlin has also authorised Ukraine to hit specific targets on Russian soil using German-supplied long-range weapons. Putin described this decision as a ""dangerous step"" that could damage relations between Berlin and Moscow.Ukrainian officials have intensified their requests for the US and other allies to empower Kyiv's forces to counterattack against threats originating from Russian territory. Kharkiv, located just 20km (12 miles) from the Russian border, has faced increased Russian assaults.According to a report from the Institute for the Study of War on June 3, Ukrainian forces likely used a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (Himars) to target a Russian S-300/400 air defense battery in the Belgorod region on June 1 or 2. The air defense system was situated roughly 60km (40 miles) from the current frontline in the northern Kharkiv region and more than 80km from the city of Kharkiv, within Himars' range.On Wednesday, Putin also mentioned that the US administration was actively working to secure the release of detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. However, he emphasized that such issues could only be resolved on a reciprocal basis.Putin noted that discussions with US intelligence agencies regarding the matter were ongoing but needed to occur in ""silence.""Gershkovich, a 32-year-old journalist for the Wall Street Journal, has been detained in Moscow's Lefortovo prison since March last year. Russian authorities have accused him of espionage during a reporting trip in Ekaterinburg. The US State Department has labeled him wrongfully detained, and Gershkovich has denied any involvement in spying.

Biden’s campaign account, which has posted hundreds of videos since its debut in February, has just 361,000 followers and 4.7 million likes.Trump’s campaign trumpeted the contrast in a press release on Wednesday, highlighting his popularity on an app that he tried to ban four years ago while he was in office.He has since come out in support of TikTok, which faces a possible ban in the US if its Chinese parent company, ByteDance Ltd., does not divest its ownership stake in the platform by Jan. 19. Biden, who signed the law that could eventually ban TikTok on grounds that the app poses a security risk to American users, is still using the platform to campaign.Content on TikTok about Trump has generally outperformed posts focused on Biden in recent months, although performance varies based on the news cycle, according to Ben Darr, the founder of CredoIQ, a social media analytics firm.The Biden campaign said it was continuing to bolster its presence on social media platforms, including TikTok and Instagram, and committed to spending millions of dollars on digital investments as well as forging bonds with influencers.Both candidates are using TikTok to appeal to young voters.

Israel ‘targets’ US lawmakers with covert influence drive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-targets-us-lawmakers-with-covert-influence-drive/articleshow/110751699.cms,"Gaza offensive won’t stop for talks: Israel

(With Reuters inputs)

TEL AVIV: Israel organised and paid for an influence campaign last year targeting US lawmakers and the American public with pro-Israel messaging , as it aimed to foster support for its actions in the war in the Gaza Strip , according to officials involved in the effort and documents related to the operation.The covert campaign was commissioned by Israel’s ministry of diaspora affairs , a govt body that connects Jews around the world with the state of Israel, four Israeli officials said. The ministry allocated about $2 million to the operation and hired Stoic , a political marketing firm in Tel Aviv, to carry it out, according to the officials and the documents.The campaign began in Oct and remains active on the social platform X. At its peak, it used hundreds of fake accounts that posed as real Americans on X, Facebook and Instagram to post pro-Israel comments. The accounts focused on US lawmakers, particularly ones who are black and Democrats, with posts urging them to continue funding Israel’s military.ChatGPT, the AI-powered chatbot, was used to generate many of the posts. The campaign also created three fake English-language news sites featuring pro-Israel articles.The Israeli govt’s connection to the influence operation, which NYT verified with four current and ex-members of ministry of diaspora affairs and documents about the campaign, has not previously been reported. FakeReporter, an Israeli misinformation watchdog, identified the effort in March.Last week, Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, and OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, said they had also found and disrupted the operation. The campaign didn’t have a widespread impact, the two companies had said. The fake accounts accumulated more than 40,000 followers across X, Facebook and Instagram, FakeReporter found. But many of those followers may have been bots and didn’t generate a large audience, Meta said.The secretive drive signals the lengths Israel was willing to go to sway American opinion on the war in Gaza. The US has long been one of Israel’s staunchest allies, with Prez Biden recently signing a $15 billion military aid package for the country. But the conflict has been unpopular with many Americans, who have called for Biden to withdraw support for Israel in the face of mounting civilian deaths in Gaza. Israel’s ministry of diaspora affairs denied involvement. Stoic didn’t respond for comment.Israel reiterated on Wednesday its refusal to halt the Gaza offensive for a resumption of hostage-release talks with Hamas, after mediator Qatar said it had given the Palestinian militants a US-backed truce proposal. “Any negotiations with Hamas would be conducted only under fire,” defence minister Yoav Gallant, said in remarks after he flew abroad a warplane to inspect the Gaza front. On the other hand, Hamas political head Ismail Haniyeh said the group will deal “seriously and positively” with any agreement that is based on the total halt of war, complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.","The covert campaign was commissioned by Israel’s ministry of diaspora affairs.

WASHINGTON: Ukraine has used US weapons to strike inside Russia in recent days, according to a Western official familiar with the matter. The weapons were used under recently approved guidance from President Joe Biden allowing American arms to be used to strike inside Russia for the limited purpose of defending Kharkiv , Ukraine’s second-largest city. The official was not authorised to comment publicly on the sensitive matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Biden’s directive allows for US-supplied weapons to be used to strike Russian forces that are attacking or preparing to attack. It does not change US policy that directs Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia, US officials have said.

Ukrainian officials had stepped up calls on the US to allow Kyiv’s forces to defend themselves against attacks originating from Russian territory. Kharkiv sits just 20km from the Russian border and has come under intensified Russian attack.

On Tuesday, White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that he could not confirm that Ukraine had used US weapons at targets in Russia. “We’re just not in a position on a day-to-day basis of knowing exactly what the Ukrainians are firing at what. It’s certainly at a tactical level.”

The administration offices, located in Building 10, were cleared within about three hours, according to a campus spokesperson, who said that there was “extensive damage.” Several walls and pillars on the exterior were covered in graffiti that criticised the police, Stanford and Israel. One officer was injured during the arrests, the spokesperson said, adding that any students who were arrested will be suspended and those who are seniors will not be allowed to graduate.Wednesday is the final day of classes for spring.

BERLIN: A municipal candidate for the far-right Alternative for Germany party was slashed with a box cutter in the German city of Mannheim , authorities said Wednesday. While police said the incident on Tuesday night did not appear to be politically motivated, it came four days after a knife attack on members of an anti-Islam party in the same city, which raised concerns about more violence in the prelude to Sunday’s vote in Germany for the European Parliament .

Tuesday’s attack occurred after Heinrich Koch , running for municipal office in Mannheim, noticed a man “taking down and slashing” AfD posters. After Koch confronted him, the man attacked Koch with a box cutter.

Koch was taken to a hospital for stitches but is expected to make a full recovery.

‘Israeli air strikes in Syria have killed Iran general’

(With Reuters inputs)

US Prez Joe Biden , asked whether PM Benjamin Netanyahu was prolonging the war in Gaza in an effort to hold on to office, said that he believes “there is every reason for people to draw that conclusion”, lending his voice to something many in his administration have been saying privately for months.His statement came in an interview with Time magazine that was conducted May 28, three days before Biden gave a speech revealing details of what he called an “Israeli plan” to bring about an exchange of hostages and a permanent ceasefire . His decision to describe the Israeli plan in public appeared to be a clear effort to lock in Netanyahu, who didn’t publicly reveal the details and seemed to back away from some of them after Biden’s statement last Friday.Both in Jerusalem and Washington, Netanyahu is widely seen as highly aware that an end to the conflict could easily result in his being swept from office — especially once investigations began into how Israel ignored evidence of the Oct 7 attack that killed 1,200 Israelis, and how slowly Israel’s defence forces responded. Street protests against him have begun to gather momentum again, seven months after the attack. Netan yahu has made clear, both before and after the attacks, that he is against a two-state solution .Tensions between Biden and Netanyahu have been obvious for months, as the Israeli PM has refused American calls for Israel to allow far larger amounts of aid to reach Palestinians, and to come up with a plan to evacuate displaced refugees from Rafah, the current centre of military action. But Biden was careful not to criticise Netanyahu other than to agree that he was clinging to office by prolonging the war.Israeli govt spokesman David Mencer, asked about the interview, said it was “outside the diplomatic norms of every right-thinking country” for Biden to make such comments.Meanwhile, the White Hou se said Biden believes the ceasefire deal on the table is the best chance to get hostages out of Gaza and end hostilities. The US will continue to work with Netanyahu to try to get the proposal over finish line, spokesman John Kirby said.Hamas cannot agree to any deal unless Israel makes a “clear” commitment to a permanent ceasefire and a complete withdrawal from Gaza, a senior official from the Palestinian militant group said on Tuesday. “Israel only wants one phase where it takes all its hostages, then it resumes its aggression and war on our people,” Osama Hamdan, a Hamas official, told a televised press conference.Qatar, which alongside the US and Egypt has been mediating talks between Hamas and Israel, has also urged Israel to provide a clear position that has the backing of its entire govt to reach a deal.Israeli air strikes near Aleppo, Syria, in the early hours of Monday killed a general in Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps who had been deployed to the country as an adviser, according to Iranian media reports. The Iranian was identified as General Saeed Abyar by Tasnim News agency, a media outlet affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards.He was believed to be the first Iranian killed by Israel since the two countries nearly went to war in April, after Israel bombed Iran’s embassy compound in Damascus, killing several commanders. Iran retaliated, attacking Israel with a barrage of 300 drones and ballistic missiles, after which Israel attacked an Iranian military base with a missile. Since then, however, the two countries stepped back from direct confrontations, facing intense global pressure to not ignite a new, wider regional war. And Iran is now enmeshed in a domestic leadership crisis, making a new wave of attacks on Israel seem unlikely. Iran has been reeling from the sudden death of Prez Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash two weeks ago.Abyar was a member of Iran’s Quds Force, a branch of the Revolutionary Guards that operates largely in other nations. He had been in Syria since 2012, when he was deployed to help the govt in Damascus fight a civil war with opposition forces and IS terrorists. The Quds Force now uses Syria as a regional headquarters for coordinating and arming militia groups known as the “axis of resistance”, including in Lebanon, Iraq and West Bank.","Hamas says can’t agree to any deal unless Israel commits to permanent ceasefire, full withdrawal from Gaza.

"After crackdown on Hong Kong, overseas communities carry the torch to keep Tiananmen memories alive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/after-crackdown-on-hong-kong-overseas-communities-carry-the-torch-to-keep-tiananmen-memories-alive/articleshow/110724811.cms,"HONG KONG: As the 35th anniversary of Beijing's Tiananmen Square crackdown neared, Rowena He, a prominent scholar of that bloody chapter of modern China's history, was busy flying between the United States, Britain and Canada to give a series of talks. Each was aimed at speaking out for those who cannot. The 1989 crackdown, in which government troops opened fire on student-led pro-democracy protesters , resulting in hundreds, if not thousands, dead, remains a taboo subject in mainland China . In Hong Kong , once a beacon of commemorative freedom, the massive June 4 annual vigil that mourned the victims for decades has vanished, a casualty of the city's clampdown on dissidents following huge anti-government protests in 2019.He was still reeling from the loss of her academic position after Hong Kong authorities last year rejected her visa renewal, widely seen as a sign of the financial hub's decline in intellectual freedom. Despite the exhausting schedule of talks, the former protester in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou in 1989 viewed this as her duty.""We cannot light the candles in Hong Kong anymore. So we would light it everywhere, globally,"" she said.As Beijing's toughened political stance effectively extinguished any large-scale commemorations within its borders, overseas commemorative events have grown increasingly crucial for preserving memories of the Tiananmen crackdown. Over the past few years, a growing number of talks, rallies, exhibitions and plays on the subject have emerged in the U.S., Britain, Canada, Australia and Taiwan.These activities foster hope and counteract the aggressive efforts to erase reminders of the crackdown, particularly those seen in Hong Kong. In 2021, the city's police charged three leaders of the group that organized the vigil with subversion under a 2020 sweeping national security law that has all but wiped out public dissent. Later, the group voted to disband. Tiananmen-related statues were also removed from universities.Last week, under a new, home-grown security law, Hong Kong police arrested seven people on suspicion of alleged sedition over their posting of social media content about commemorating the Tiananmen crackdown. A Christian newspaper, which typically publishes content related to the event ahead of its anniversary, left its front page mostly blank. It said it could only turn words into blank squares and white space to respond to the current situation.On Tuesday, the park that used to hold the vigil will be occupied by a carnival held by pro-Beijing groups.However, attempts to silence commemorative efforts have failed to erase the harrowing memories from the minds of a generation of liberal-minded Chinese in the years after tanks rolled into the heart of Beijing to break up weeks of student-led protests that had spread to other cities and were seen as a threat to Communist Party rule.He, who was 17 years old at the time, recalls that protesters like her took to the streets out of love for their country. When the crackdown happened, she spent the entire night in front of her TV, unable to sleep. After she returned to school, she was required to recite the official narrative - that the government had successfully quelled a riot - in order to pass her exams.""I never killed anyone. But I lived with that survivor's guilt all those years,"" she said.To preserve memories of the event, a museum dedicated to the Tiananmen crackdown opened in New York last June. It features exhibits such as a blood-stained shirt and a tent used by student protesters.A similar museum operated by vigil organizers was shuttered in Hong Kong in 2021.As of early May, its board chair Wang Dan, also a leading former student leader of the Tiananmen protests, estimated the New York museum attracted about 1,000 people, including Chinese immigrants, U.S. citizens and Hong Kongers. To expand its audience, Wang said he plans to organize temporary exhibitions on university campuses in the U.S., and possibly in other countries over the longer term.He said overseas memorial events are crucial because mainland Chinese and Hong Kongers can see overseas memorial activities online.""It can have an effect in mainland China because young people there all know how to use VPNs to circumvent internet censorship,"" he said.Aline Sierp, a professor of European history and memory studies at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, said overseas commemorative activities allow the memories to travel and endure, providing access for other people and future generations.But she said it can be ""a double-edged sword"" because adapting the memories to new places might risk fragmenting or de-contextualizing them in the future.Alison Landsberg, a memory studies scholar at George Mason University in Virginia, said that overseas efforts carry the potential to inspire people from other places who are facing their own challenges in the pursuit of democracy.To carry the memories forward, film and television dramas can be powerful tools for people to take on memories of events through which they didn't live, she said.She said overseas theater productions about the crackdown, which began last year in Taiwan and continued in London this year, have a greater possibility of making those connections and potentially reaching a broader audience.""When you have a dramatic narrative, you have the capacity to bring the viewer into the story in a kind of intimate way,"" Landsberg said.Last week, members of an audience at a London theater were visibly moved, some to tears, after watching the play ""May 35th,"" a title that subtly references the June 4 crackdown.The play, produced by Lit Ming-wai, part of the Hong Kong diaspora who moved to the U.K. after the enactment of the 2020 security law, tells the story of an elderly couple who wish to properly mourn their son who died in 1989.Its director, Kim Pearce, who was born in the U.K. in the 1980s, said the tragedy had resonated with her from a young age and she was once moved to tears when she read the poem ""Tiananmen"" by James Fenton. Working on this project, she said, has further deepened her connection to the stories.British theater-goer Sue Thomas, 64, also found the play deeply moving. ""Particularly as a parent myself now, which I wasn't then, which sort of made me think of it in a much more sort of heartfelt way,"" she said.At the theater, He, the scholar, served as one of the post-show speakers, sharing her struggles and the motivations behind her work with the audience. She said the play was so powerful that it made her relive the trauma of the past 35 years, leaving her in tears and causing her to lose her contact lenses.""It shows how much suffering people had to endure all these years,"" she said. ""If there's anything we can do, I hope that we would bring the younger generation to understand this.""","The 1989 crackdown, in which government troops opened fire on student-led pro- democracy protesters, remains a taboo subject in mainland China.

Russia bots target Paris Olympics with deepfake Tom Cruise video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/russia-bots-target-paris-olympics-with-deepfake-tom-cruise-video/articleshow/110718318.cms,"With its athletes barred from competing in the Summer Olympics under the country’s flag, Russia has turned its fury on the Games and this year’s host, Paris.

Russian propagandists have created an hour-long documentary, spoofed news reports and even mimicked French and US intelligence agencies to issue fake warnings urging people to avoid the Games, according to a report released on Sunday by Microsoft. The report details the disinformation campaign created by a group the company calls Storm-1679. The campaign appears to have accelerated since March, flooding social media with short videos raising alarms about pos sible terrorist attacks and stoking fears about safety. The operation, while aimed at the Games, is using various techniques to spread disinformation that could also be employed in European and US elections.

The work began in earnest last summer with the release of a fake documentary about the International Olympic Committee, expropriating Netflix’s logo and using an artificial-intelligence-powered voice impersonating Tom Cruise . The committee succeeded in having the video titled “Olympics Has Fallen” — a spoof of the 2013 film “Olympus Has Fallen” — removed from YouTube. The attacks have continued, though, with persistent efforts to discredit its leadership, the committee said in March, citing a campaign that used fake recordings of what purported to be telephone calls by officials of the African Union on behalf of Russia.

Storm-1679 now appears to be making shorter videos that are easier to create. It used to focus on disparaging Ukrainian refugees in the West, but after French Prez Macron began to publicly consider sending French troops to Ukraine, it shifted to the Olympics. Microsoft estimates that Storm-1679 produces three to eight faked videos a week, in English and French, with many impersonating the BBC, Al Jazeera and other broadcasters. The group appears to respond quickly to news events, su ch as protests in New Caledonia, a French territory in the Pacific. Others focus on the prospect of a terror attack in Paris.

Most of the videos pretending to be from CIA and French intelligence are relatively simple. They are unlike anything CIA has actually produced, but to unsuspecting readers online, they could appear legitimate, using the agency’s logo and stark white-on-black typography. “They are trying to cultivate an anticipation of violence,” Clint Watts of Microsoft, said of the group Storm-1679. “They want people to be fearful of going to the Olympics.” French officials and Microsoft say one of the group’s tactics appears to be trying to get the attention of factcheckers. “The content doesn’t normally travel from one platform to another, but when their false content is fact-checked by accounts with a large following, the content gets far more views and in front of new and different audiences,” Watts said","Russian propagandists have created an hour-long documentary, spoofed news reports and even mimicked French and US intelligence agencies.

Tragically, the toddler was pronounced dead at the scene, while the mother was taken to a local hospital in critical condition.A 2-week-old sibling, who was in a crib in a separate room, was not injured but was taken to a hospital for evaluation, according to Livonia Fire Department Chief Robert Johnson.""This is a terrible tragedy for our community,"" Mayor Maureen Miller Brosnan said in the statement. ""Our hearts are broken, too, and we send our deepest sympathies.""The city of Livonia activates warning sirens based on notifications from the National Weather Service or tornado reports, officials said.

All five were transported to a hospital for treatment.Local television footage showed large downed trees that caused damage to houses. Additionally, David Pazos, Montgomery County Fire and Rescue assistant chief, reported widespread power outages in the area.""We don't know what people's needs are, so we're having to go door to door to assess whether they need fire and rescue services or need relocation because of damage to their homes,"" he said.Tornado warnings were still being issued throughout the state and in Delaware on Wednesday night.(With agency inputs)","A quick-developing tornado struck Livonia, Michigan on Wednesday afternoon.

Tearful Amanda Knox blames Italian police for murder case slander,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tearful-amanda-knox-blames-italian-police-for-murder-case-slander/articleshow/110743852.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amanda Knox , an American, appeared in court on Wednesday for a slander case connected to her notorious imprisonment and subsequent acquittal for the 2007 murder of her British roommate, Meredith Kercher . During the hearing, Knox tearfully apologised for falsely accusing an innocent man, Patrick Lumumba , of the crime, attributing her initial false statement to pressure from Italian police .Knox, who was 20 years old at the time of the murder, described the night of her interrogation as ""the worst night of my life,"" claiming that she was questioned for hours in a language she barely understood, without an official translator or lawyer. She alleged that the police refused to believe her when she said she didn't know who the killer was and that she was yelled at and slapped during the investigation.""I'm very sorry I was not strong enough to have resisted the police pressure,"" Knox told the judges.""I was scared, tricked and mistreated. I gave the testimony in a moment of existential crisis.""The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2019 that Knox had not been provided with adequate legal representation or a professional interpreter during her interrogation, compromising the fairness of the proceedings. This ruling was cited by Italy's top court last year when it ordered a retrial for the slander case.Lumumba's lawyer, Carlo Pacelli, described how Knox's accusation changed his client's life, turning him into ""the monster of Perugia"" in the public eye. The verdict in the slander case can be appealed by both parties.The murder trial attracted significant global attention, with much of it focusing on prosecutors' claims that Kercher died as part of a sex game gone wrong. However, Italy's highest court, when it ultimately acquitted Knox and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, stated that there had been ""major flaws"" in the police investigation. Ivorian Rudy Guede remains the only person convicted of Kercher's murder, having been sentenced in 2008 and released early in November 2021.Now 36 years old with two young children, Knox works as a journalist, author, and advocate for criminal justice reform.

The uploads also included pictures of Pakistan’s current civilian and military leaderships and alleged they stole the mandate of the Imran-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in general elections this Feb.“Every Pakistani should study the Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report and get to know who was the true traitor, General Yahya Khan or Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,” said a quote attributed to Imran.The commission had probed Pakistan’s political-military involvement in East-Pakistan --- current-day Bangladesh --- from 1947 to 1971. The video referred to purported crimes by the Pakistani military during the civil war in East Pakistan and claimed former military dictator General Yahya was responsible.Strong backlash followed the posts, especially from government ranks who called it “alarming” and accused PTI of fuelling a narrative of “hatred and incitement” by drawing comparisons between Imran and Mujib.On Friday, Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) officials visited the prison where Imran has been kept to quiz him over the post but he refused to meet them without lawyers. FIA has sent a notice to Imran on the matter.This was followed by a meeting of army commanders, which vowed to defeat what it termed “digital terrorism” by trying to induce despondency and sowing discord by peddling “blatant lies, fake news, and propaganda”. “The nation is fully cognisant of their ugly and ulterior motives and the designs of these nefarious forces,” General Munir was quoted army’s media wing as saying.Imran’s PTI had until recently been trying to disassociate itself from the controversial posts but “owned” them on his directions. A meeting of PTI’s core committee was held on Friday. “Hamoodur Rehman Commission Report must be made public to avoid 1971 like grave challenges, learn a lesson from the past and apprise the people about what exactly happened in 1971,” PTI said in a statement after the meeting.The statement then sought to draw a parallel between 1970 and the current situation in Pakistan. “In 1971 debacle, the most important aspect was rejection of the people’s mandate, which is also presently prevailing in the country,” PTI said.",The posts were uploaded by Imran’s social media team last week on his X account.

Duggal mentioned that Farhad's family had met him, suggesting that the habeas corpus petition should be dismissed.Presiding over the proceedings, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani considered the plea filed by Arooj Zainab, Farhad's spouse, as reported by Dunya News.Petitioner's counsel Imaan Mazari emphasised that her client sought not only her husband's return but also action against those responsible for his enforced disappearance.The HC emphasised that the case would only conclude upon Farhad's appearance in court.AAG Duggal argued that PoJK, with its own constitution and courts, was considered foreign territory. Judgments from Pakistani courts were treated akin to those from foreign courts, as per Dunya News.The petitioner's attorney informed the court that Farhad's family had traveled from Islamabad to the Dhirkot police station but were told upon arrival that he had been moved to Muzaffarabad due to terrorism-related charges. When questioned about Farhad's whereabouts before his May 29 detention, the Islamabad prosecutor general deferred to the PoK court.Justice Kayani remarked that everyone should work within the law, to which the prosecutor general maintained that he works within the law, reported Dunya News.""We have to determine the misuse of law,"" Kayani said to the petitioner's attorney's argument that the court should also consider cases involving the misuse of laws and procedures.The court adjourned the hearing of the case until June 7, rejecting the request to dispose of the petition for the recovery of poet Ahmed Farhad.","Pakistan government lawyer admitted before Islamabad high court that Pakistan- Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) is not a part of their country.

"Battered, empty Myanmar town shows price of victory against junta",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/battered-empty-myanmar-town-shows-price-of-victory-against-junta/articleshow/110584110.cms,"PAUKTAW: Gutted buildings, vacant windows and blocks bombed to rubble show the price paid by the western Myanmar town of Pauktaw for victory against the junta in the country's civil war.Fighters from the Arakan Army (AA) ethnic minority armed group took control of the fishing port of 20,000 people in January, as the conflict sparked by the military's coup entered its fourth year.Pauktaw was one of a string of losses suffered by the junta across the country at the time, leading many to hope its decades-long stranglehold over Myanmar's politics could be broken.Four months later, the Arakan Army remains in control but Pauktaw is mostly empty of residents, who are living on the outskirts and fearful of a repeat of the junta's heavy artillery attacks on the town.""We are frightened of them (the military),"" one man told AFP from his temporary home just outside Pauktaw, asking for anonymity for security reasons.""We don't know what will happen or what kind of weapon they will drop on us if we go and stay back at home in the town.""We can't detect their air strikes or bombs and we will be killed if they attack.""Video taken by locals this month and obtained exclusively by AFP shows streets silent apart from birdsong and the sounds of AA soldiers sifting through piles of debris and sheets of corrugated iron.Near a deserted market that once bustled with vendors buying and selling crabs and tiger shrimp, a ragged awning advertising a mobile phone carrier flutters above the doorway of a gutted shop.Phone and internet services have been all but cut off.- No chance -The AA has fought an on-off war for years against the Myanmar military, seeking more autonomy for the state's ethnic Rakhine population.As the army has faced growing resistance to its rule, from multiple armed groups -- some new, some long-established -- the AA has stepped up its campaign.As the junta has lost territory on the ground, it is increasingly calling on its air power to support its ground troops.Rights groups accuse the junta of using the strikes to punish communities suspected of opposing its rule.When a military helicopter hovered over Pauktaw and began shooting into the town last November, many fled in panic.""There was no chance for us to take a single thing from our house,"" one woman now living outside the town told AFP.""We had cooked a pot of rice and we were not able to eat it,"" she said, also asking for anonymity.""We had no money when we fled. We only had some gold jewellery with us. We tried to pawn that but it wasn't easy. The interest was too high.""The fate of Pauktaw's residents reflects a nationwide tragedy. Across Myanmar, around 2.7 million have been forced to flee by the civil war.- Looting -The AA has not allowed residents to live back in Pauktaw, citing the danger of more air or artillery strikes on the town, although it does allow them to come and go to pick up items.The man who spoke to AFP said he had returned to check on his house and found it partly in ruins, with the family statue of the Buddha fallen onto the floor.His savings box -- containing money for a Buddhist ritual for his children and for timber to repair a roof damaged by a cyclone last year -- was gone, he said.""I have lost all of that money,"" he said.""Everything in our house got stolen... my father's fishing nets were stolen,"" another woman said, also requesting anonymity.""I am a tailor, and luckily, I managed to save my sewing machines.""During the fighting, both sides looted houses and damaged buildings, according to local reports.In March, the AA said it would ""investigate"" any reports of looting by its members during the fighting.- 'Decisive battle' -The AA's offensive has seized swathes of territory in Rakhine state and along the border with India and Bangladesh.It has said it will capture state capital Sittwe, 25 kilometres from Pauktaw and the last major town in northern Rakhine in the military's hands.In April, the AA warned residents of the town, which is home to an India-backed deep sea port, to leave ahead of a ""decisive"" battle.Sittwe residents contacted by AFP said the military was restricting travel out of the town by road and river and the prices of basic foods such as rice and eggs had doubled.Those already displaced from Pauktaw fear further fighting nearby.""I am sad that we have fled our own house and we can't live in it,"" one resident told AFP.""I have pawned my necklace for 18 lakhs ($850) so we have money to live. I still hope I can claim it back.""Others said they wanted payback.""I haven't joined the Arakan Army because I am worried about who will look after my child,"" one woman said.""If I wasn't... I would join them and fight back. I will be satisfied only if I can take revenge.""","Fighters from the Arakan Army (AA) ethnic minority armed group took control of Pauktaw in January. Four months later, the town is mostly empty of residents, who are living on the outskirts. The AA has fought an on-off war for years against the Myanmar military, seeking more autonomy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110584293,imgsize-1591197,width-400,resizemode-4/110584293.jpg"
