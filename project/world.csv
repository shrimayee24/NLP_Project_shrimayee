NEW DELHI: A Hindu youth was beaten to death by a mob and his body set on fire in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district on Thursday night following allegations of blasphemy, BBC Bangla reported, amid continuing unrest in the country and growing concerns over attacks on minorities and media institutions.The incident took place in the Dubalia Para area of Square Master Bari in Bhaluka upazila. Police identified the victim as Dipu Chandra Das, who worked at a local garment factory and lived in the area as a tenant.“A group of agitated people caught him and beat him up around 9 pm on Thursday for insulting the Prophet. Then they set his body on fire,” Ripon Mia, duty officer of Bhaluka police station, told BBC Bangla. He said the attackers tied the body to a tree before setting it ablaze.Police reached the spot after receiving information and brought the situation under control.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The BJP-led Mahayuti alliance on Sunday recorded a sweeping win in Maharashtra’s local body polls, winning elections to 288 municipal councils and nagar panchayats by securing 207 local body president posts and leaving the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi with a combined total of 44.As per the State Election Commission’s data, the BJP emerged as the single largest party with 117 municipal presidents, followed by the Shiv Sena with 53 and the NCP with 37. On the opposition side, the Congress won 28 posts, Shiv Sena (UBT) nine, and the NCP (SP) seven.Other registered parties accounted for four additional posts, while 28 municipal president seats were won by unrecognised registered parties. Independents secured five posts, the Commission said.Counting of votes for 286 municipal councils and nagar panchayats, conducted in two phases, showed the BJP emerging as the single largest party.Earlier, Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis reacting to the results said, “48 per cent councillors have been elected on the BJP symbol, which is a record. The BJP has created another record with 3,300 councillors being elected from the party. BJP candidates have been elected as presidents in 129 municipal councils.In 75 per cent of the local bodies, Mahayuti nominees have been elected as municipal presidents.”He attributed the success to the party organisation and the government’s development agenda, noting, “It is the team effort – the organisation and government. We fought the polls on the development plank. I led a positive campaign on the development agenda. I never criticised any political leader or party. I solicited votes on the development agenda, the work done by the government so far, and our blueprint for the future. ”PM Narendra Modi hailed the results of the local body polls saying people of Maharastra stand with development. He went on to congratulate the Mahayuti for the victory.In a post on X PM said, ""Maharashtra stands firmly with development! Grateful to the people of Maharashtra for blessing the BJP and Mahayuti in the Municipal Council and Nagar Panchayat elections. This reflects trust in our vision of people-centric development. We remain committed to working with renewed energy to fulfil the aspirations of every citizen across the state. I laud the BJP and Mahayuti Karyakartas for their hardwork at the grassroots. ""Mahayuti allies - including BJP, Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, and Ajit Pawar’s NCP - contested in some areas against each other. While opposition parties, mainly Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT), conceded defeat and raised allegations. There were alliances as well as ""friendly fights"" among Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) constituents as well. .State Congress president Harshwardhan Sapkal congratulated winning candidates but added, in a comment, that the state election commission “helped” the ruling alliance. Shiv Sena (UBT) leaders accused the Mahayuti of using “money and muscle power” and alleged EVM tampering, PTI reported.Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut said the victory of Mahayuti was because of ""tampering"" of EVMs. He added the opposition couldn't withstand a ""hailstorm"" of money.His party colleague Ambadas Danve alleged ""money and muscle power"" shaped the Mahayuti win.""The Mahayuti has bagged a larger number of seats as compared to constituents of the Maha Vikas Aghadi, thanks to the muscle and money power deployed by the ruling parties,"" Danve told PTI in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar.BJP state president Ravindra Chavan described the results as a “decisive mandate,” claiming Mahayuti had won more than 250 councils, nagar parishads, and nagar panchayats, with BJP candidates securing 134 council chief posts and over 3,000 councillor seats.""The Opposition levelled all kinds of allegations during the campaign, but people saw through them. Uddhav Thackeray himself said he had nothing to offer to the people and that is why his party was rejected. His party could not even win council chairperson posts in double digits,"" Chavan claimed.He went on to say, ""Now, Mumbaikars too would reject the opposition's narrative in the upcoming BMC polls.""Union minister Nitin Gadkari called it an “overwhelming success” and “a victory for our workers.”While the Mahayuti largely dominated the elections, Congress and NCP retained control in some areas, including Chandrapur, Sangli, and Loha, with wins in Palghar for the Shiv Sena and in Nanded for Marathwada Janhit Party.Recounting was ordered in Kamptee municipal council after a narrow 116-vote BJP victory, officials said.","The BJP-led Mahayuti alliance won elections to 288 municipal councils and nagar panchayats by securing 207 local body president posts.

Nitish Kumar's Hijab Shocker: BJP MP Giriraj Singh Defends Bihar CM's Act With 'Go To Hell' Remark

NEW DELHI: A woman doctor at the centre of the recent hijab row after Bihar CM Nitish Kumar lifted her naqab during an event did not join duty on Saturday, officials confirmed to news agency PTI. They also reported no contact with her or the family members.Patna civil surgeon Avinash Kumar Singh confirmed that Nusrat Parveen had not reported for duty till 7 pm on Saturday, after which the “possibility window for the day” closed.“I have been informed that the last date of joining has been extended beyond December 20. It remains to be seen whether Parveen joins on Monday or not,” he said, without specifying the new deadline.The controversy erupted earlier this week during an appointment letter distribution programme at the chief minister’s secretariat in Patna. The video circulated widely on social media, capturing the moment Nitish Kumar questioned Parveen’s naqab when she came forward to receive her appointment letter along with other Ayush doctors.Also Read: Hijab row: SCBA issues 'strongest condemnation' over Nitish Kumar's act; seeks unconditional apology from Giriraj Singh, Sanjay Nishad Civil surgeon Singh said he was not aware of the reason for Parveen’s delay, as he “had no contact with her or the family members.”Vijay Kumar, a surgeon at Sabalpur PHC in Patna Sadar, where Parveen was supposed to join, also confirmed she had not reported for duty.“Around five-six people have joined today, and Parveen is not among them... Her name is in the list but we have not received her appointment letter from the civil surgeon office in Patna,” he said. As per protocol, candidates must first report to the civil surgeon’s office before joining their assigned workplace.Meanwhile, governor Arif Mohammad Khan expressed disappointment over the controversy.“It pains me to hear the word ‘dispute’ in this case. Can there be any row between a father and a daughter?” he asked.“What have you people made out of it? This man (Nitish Kumar) considers female students as his daughters,” he added while speaking to reporters in Patna.Earlier, Mahfoozur Rahman, principal of Government Tibbi College & Hospital (GTCH), where Parveen is a second-year student, also suggested the joining deadline had been extended “in this special case”.“Ayush doctor Nusrat Parveen has not joined yet, and there is no update on her future course of action,” Rahman said.According to him, the family wants to avoid media attention. “Her family said that they want to escape media coverage, and that the woman doctor will rethink whether to join or not,” he said.Rahman also dismissed rumours that the family had shifted to Kolkata. “They have themselves rubbished such false news reports,” he said, quoting Parveen’s husband as saying the family is not upset with Nitish Kumar or the government.He added that “the family is disappointed with the row stirred by the media.”Rahman said Parveen last attended college on December 17 or 18 and noted that she still has the option to either join duty or pursue higher education.","Nusrat Parveen had not reported for duty till 7 pm on Saturday, after which the “possibility window for the day” closed.

NEW DELHI: Senior Sikh leader and Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Sunday condemned the disruption of a peaceful Sikh Nagar Kirtan procession in South Auckland, New Zealand, expressing concern over the threat posed to religious freedom and communal harmony.Sharing a video of the incident on X, Badal said, “Nagar Kirtan is a sacred Sikh tradition—a joyous religious parade involving the singing of hymns from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, promoting devotion, unity, and sharing of blessings with all humanity. I am glad to note that the Sikh community responded with remarkable restraint and peace despite provocation—true to Guru Sahib’s teachings of ‘Chardi kala’ and ‘Sarbat Da Bhala’. ”“Such intimidation threatens religious freedom and the spirit of universal brotherhood,” he added.Badal further urged external affairs minister S Jaishankar to intervene and raise the matter with the New Zealand government to “protect the rights of the Indian diaspora.”On Saturday, a Sikh religious procession in New Zealand was disrupted by a group of ‘Patriot’ protesters. According to reports by the NZ Herald, the group was linked to political leader Brian Tamaki’s Destiny Church, a Christian fundamentalist religious organisation.In a video shared on Tamaki’s social media, members of a group calling themselves the True Patriots of NZ were seen confronting the Sikh procession as it moved along the street. The group described themselves as “Guardians of the Kiwi Way of Life. Defenders of Faith, Flag & Family,” and said they oppose “globalism, mass immigration, and woke ideology.”The protesters displayed a large banner reading, “This is New Zealand not India.” While being kept apart from the Sikh group by police, they linked arms, performed a haka, and chanted “One true God,” “Jesus,” and “God of nation.”Inspector Matt Hoyes said around 50 protesters blocked the road in an attempt to disrupt the parade. He stated, “Police acted swiftly to ensure the parade was able to safely continue and additional officers were called in to escort the parade participants through the remainder of their route.”","Senior Sikh leader Sukhbir Singh Badal condemned the disruption of a peaceful Sikh Nagar Kirtan procession in South Auckland, New Zealand.

India Rejects Dhaka Media Reports On Protest Outside Bangladesh HC, Flags Attack Against Minorities

Bangladesh unrest

NEW DELHI: India on Sunday rejected reports of the Bangladesh media as ""misleading propaganda"" over a protest that took place outside the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi following the “horrendous killing” of Dipu Chandra Das, a member of the minority community, in Mymensingh. The ministry of external affairs (MEA) said that India is closely monitoring the situation in the neighbouring country and has voiced strong concerns over the continuing atrocities against minorities in Bangladesh.The MEA also clarified that the small group that gathered outside the high commission of Bangladesh was dispersed by police shortly after.In an official statement, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""We have noted misleading propaganda in sections of the Bangladesh media on the incident. The fact is that about 20-25 youth gathered in front of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi on 20 December and raised slogans in protest against the horrendous killing of Dipu Chandra Das in Mymensingh, while also calling for the protection of all minorities in Bangladesh. There was no attempt to breach the fence or create a security situation at any time. The police stationed at the spot dispersed the group after a few minutes.Visual evidence of these events is available publicly for all to see. India is committed to ensure the safety of foreign Missions/Posts in its territory in accordance with the Vienna Convention.""The MEA added, ""India continues to keep a close watch on the evolving situation in Bangladesh. Our officials remain in touch with Bangladesh authorities and have conveyed to them our strong concerns at the attacks on minorities. We have also urged that the perpetrators of the barbaric killing of Das be brought to justice.”Security was heightened outside the Bangladesh High Commission even as widespread violence spread across Bangladesh following the death of Osman Hadi and the mob lynching of Dipu Chandra Das.Widespread unrest swept across Bangladesh earlier this week following the death of key student activist Sharif Osman Hadi. Large groups of protesters surged through Dhaka and several other cities as anger mounted.Hadi, the spokesperson of Inqilab Mancha, succumbed to injuries after an assassination attempt in Dhaka, according to an official statement issued by the ministry of foreign affairs in Singapore. His death triggered massive uproar, with interim leader Muhammad Yunus vowing justice and “no leniency” for those responsible.Amid this rising turmoil, a Hindu youth, Dipu Chandra Das, was lynched by a mob in Mymensingh over alleged blasphemy, and his body was set on fire on Friday. The brutal killing drew strong outrage and condemnation in India, leading to protests outside the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi.","India rejects reports of the Bangladesh media as ""misleading propaganda"" Protest took place outside the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi following the “horrendous killing” of Dipu Chandra Das, a member of the minority community.

NEW DELHI: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Sunday defended the party’s high command amid the ongoing leadership issue in Karnataka, saying the “confusion” is at the local level.“The high command hasn’t created any confusion. The confusion exists at the local level. Is it right to put the blame on the high command?” he said while speaking to reporters in Kalaburagi in Karnataka, his home state.Kharge called on the Congress' local leaders to take “ownership” of the internal disputes instead of blaming the high command.The veteran politician also cautioned leaders against claiming credit for the party’s electoral successes.“Everyone has built the party. It’s not the effort of any one individual. Congress has been built by party workers. Congress workers supported us,” he stated, without naming anyone.His remarks come amid the ongoing power tussle in Karnataka between chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy, DK Shivakumar , who also heads the Congress’ state unit.It has been widely reported that after the Congress won the May 2023 Karnataka assembly elections—ousting its arch-rival BJP from power—the high command had promised to make Shivakumar chief minister for the second half of the five-year term, while opting for veteran Siddaramaiah initially.Under Siddaramaiah, Karnataka's Congress government completed the first 2.5 years of its term on November 20.The chief minister on Friday expressed confidence that the party leadership would back him to complete his full five-year term.","Kharge called on the Congress' local leaders to take “ownership” of the internal disputes.

NAGPUR: In its 40-year electoral history, the elusive Kamptee municipal council president post finally landed in BJP’s lap as its candidate Ajay Agrawal won by a wafer-thin margin of 103 votes. The runner-up, Congress’ Shakur Nagani alleged that despite leading for a major part of the day, the sudden change in fortunes towards the end seemed suspicious.Kamptee council president post was the most talked about in Nagpur district because of the sharp verbal spat between candidates which spiralled into accusations of malpractice towards the end of the campaign. It all started with former MLC Sulekha Kumbhare fielding Ajay Kadam from her Bahujan Republican Ekta Manch (BREM) and hoping for support from ally BJP. Kumbhare shares cordial relationship with BJP, especially Union minister Nitin Gadkari who often refers to her as his sister.But BJP, keen to have a saffron sweep, pushed Agrawal and refused alliance. Meanwhile, Congress fielded its candidate despite controversy over ticket allocation.","BJP candidate Ajay Agrawal won by a wafer-thin margin of 103 votes.

Bring to justice perpetrators of Dipu’s ‘barbaric killing’, New Delhi tells Dhaka



NEW DELHI: India hit out at Bangladesh and suspended visa operations at its mission in Chittagong on Sunday, amid a wave of protests there with an anti-India hue sparked by the death of radical activist Sharif Osman Hadi , which has seen the lynching of a Hindu man.Describing as ""horrend-ous"" the killing of 25-year-old Dipu Chandra Das, a garment factory worker beaten to death by a mob and set ablaze for alleged blasphemy, MEA slammed attempts in Bangladesh to draw false equivalence between protests targeting its facilities in that country and the one outside the Bangladesh mission in Delhi.India's assistant high commission in Chittagong suspended visa operations over concern for safety of the centre's staff and premises in view of angry protests, which saw demonstrators come close to the diplomatic facility on Thursday despite presence of Bangladesh security personnel.Due to the recent security incident, Indian visa oper-ations at IVAC Chittagong will remain suspended from Dec 21, 2025, until further notice, the Indian Visa Appli-cation Centre (IVAC) said in a statement.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal in Delhi urged the interim govt in Dhaka to bring to justice the perpetrators of the “barbaric killing” of Dipu, leading Bangladesh to protest.“The incident should not be conflated with the security of minorities,” foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said in Dhaka, adding, “He was a Bangladeshi citizen who was killed, and Bangladesh took immediate action.Several arrests have already been made.”He also claimed that the protests in New Delhi left the “Bangladesh high commissioner and his family feeling threatened”.The assistant Indian high Commissioner’s residence in Chittagong was pelted with stones by a mob on Thursday, the day Hadi died days after being shot in head by masked gunmen. Thursday also saw massive “anti-India” protests outside the assistant Indian high commissions in Khulna and Rajshahi, and on Wednesday, around the high commission in Dhaka.In an apparent attempt to suggest that the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi faced a security threat of similar severity, media reports Bangladesh said a demonstration by “Hindu extremists” outside the facility over Dipu’s death in Mymensingh threatened its security, drawing a sharp rejoinder from the MEA.India trashed such claims as “misleading propaganda”. There was “no attempt to breach the fence or create a security situation at any time,” the MEA said, adding police dispersed the group after a few minutes and visual evidence of these events is publicly available. “We have noted misleading propaganda in sections of the Bangladesh media on the incident,” Jaiswal said.The MEA said about 20-25 youths had gathered outside the Bangladesh high commission on Saturday and raised slogans in protest against the “horrendous killing” of Dipu.“India continues to keep a close watch on the evolving situation in Bangladesh. Our officials remain in touch with Bangladesh authorities and have conveyed to them our strong concerns at the attacks on minorities,” Jaiswal said.Pictures of the two protests pointed out the contrast as angry protesters came in close proximity to the Indian facility in Chittagong, while a much smaller crowd stood in protest at a safe distance from the Bangladesh high commission.Exiled Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasreen had on Saturday introduced another dimension to the horrific killing of Dipu, claiming on X that police had initially rescued him from the mob and asked if police with sympathies for extremists handed him back to the violent crowd determined to kill or they were overpowered. “They held a full-blown celebration — beating Dipu, hanging him, burning him — a jihadist festival,” she said.On Sunday, two more persons were held in the Mymensingh lynching case, taking the total arrests to 12.Internal situation has deteriorated in Bangladesh after the death of Haidi, a prominent face in 2024 anti-govt protests that led to then PM Sheikh Hasina abdicating & fleeing to India. Known for his anti-India utterances, he was a leader of radical group Inquilab Mancho & had shared a map of greater Bangladesh that showed India’s north east as part of his country.",India has suspended visa operations at its mission in Chittagong. The move comes amid a wave of protests there with an anti-India hue. The protests were sparked by the death of radical activist Sharif Osman Hadi. Hadi was shot in head by masked gunmen after he fled to India.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126109902,imgsize-661554,width-400,resizemode-4/image-ians.jpg"

BULANDSHAHR: Ahead of sentencing in the brutal gang rape of a woman and her daughter at gunpoint on NH-91 in UP in 2016 which shocked the nation, one of the survivors - then a 14-year-old schoolgirl and now a 23-year-old woman studying law with hopes of becoming a judge - told TOI from an undisclosed location on Sunday that what she and her family endured in the time since the incident was ""savage and inhuman"" but they stuck together and fought on.""We changed addresses and cities multiple times to avoid recognition and harassment. But every time we were identified and vilified,"" she said, breaking down repeate-dly over the course of the conversation. ""I remember every face. They're not human - they are demons,"" she said of the continuous nightmares.A day after a court in Bulandshahr convicted five of the men involved in the gang rape, she said it has given them hope. ""But it will take a long time - perhaps an eternity - for us to heal. What they did didn't just violate our bodies - it also destroyed our lives, peace, our future."" Her voice sometimes choking with emotions, she added: ""The trauma never leaves you. Nights are the worst. I still wake up frightened.""The family was forced to change houses five times in the past decade. “But how long can we keep hiding our identity from neighbours?” she asked.“Someone comes to know about our past, and it spreads like fire. People start looking at us with contempt. The environment around us turns hostile. Harassers become active. They follow me on the road, pass lewd comments, and even roam around my house. But we did not break. I did not break. ”Repeated relocation took a toll on the family financially too. “My father once owned three cars and ran them as taxis. Today, he works night shifts driving someone else’s car,” she said. She added: “I’m the only child and I also wanted to support my parents. My education suffered as we had to change places so many times.” Pursuing a law degree, she said she wants to become a judge some day for the cause of rape survivors like her. Her mother, trying to hold back her tears, said, “We were a normal family then... We had never seen a court or spoken to police. But after that day, our lives changed forever.”Recalling that day, her father told TOI how helpless he was. “We were supposed to attend my grandmother’s funeral. It was around 1am when, on the highway, I heard a loud bang. We paused thinking something had hit our vehicle. All of a sudden, 7 to 8 men emerged from the bushes and overpowered us at gunpoint.” He added: “My wife, daughter, brother, his wife and his young son were all there. They dragged my wife and daughter into the bushes. My daughter kept pleading before them. I was right there, but couldn’t save them.”That incident cost them everything, he said. “I had to look for places where nobody knew us. Finding a job became a huge struggle. Today, I barely earn Rs 12,000-15,000 a month by driving someone else’s car.”The gruesome crime happened on July 29, 2016, when the family’s vehicle was intercepted near a village, while they were travelling to Shahjahanpur from Noida.","A day after a court in Bulandshahr convicted five of the men involved in the gang rape, she said it has given them hope.

KOLKATA: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday said seeing the Sangh through the lens of BJP would be a ""big mistake"". Bhagwat, who tried to define ""Hindus"" and the ""Indian society"", said the goal of the Sangh is organisation of Hindu society, but it is not aimed at opposing others.Speaking at Kolkata Vyakhyanmala, an interactive session to celebrate the centenary of RSS, Bhagwat said, ""Many have a tendency to understand Sangh through the lens of BJP. That is a big mistake,"" while trying to clearly separate the two.""Swayamsevaks in Sangh work in varied fields. Some are in politics. Some are in the party in office (at the Centre),"" he added, explaining the genesis and growth of the Sangh during his over an hour-long speech.Bhagwat said, ""There are people who spread wrong narratives about the Sangh. Interpretation of the Sangh should be objective and not through secondary sources. The goal of the Sangh is organisation of the entire Hindu society, but it is not aimed at opposing others...If you see that Sangh is anti-Muslim, you can make (that) your opinion. But change your opinion if you don't find that.""Stressing on the need for a political awakening in the state, Bhagwat said Congress was created as a means for political awakening and struggle for Independence.""There was a large-scale political awakening and people fought for this country. We got freedom...But there was another section which stressed on social reforms before Independence. The tradition started with Raja Ram Mohan Roy,"" he said.Bhagwat said: ""We have to organise society and not create any separate organisation within society."" Harping on diversity in ""Hindu society"", Bhagwat said, ""Hindu is not a name but an attribute and denotes a nature. Those who respect their motherland are Hindus. They could have different languages, rituals, attire or eating habits.""The RSS chief added that Muslims should understand that they might be different ""in terms of worship"", but they are part of the unified entity in terms of ""nation, culture and society"". Terming the proposed Babri Masjid a ""political conspiracy"", he said, ""It is neither in favour of Muslims, nor Hindus. It is happening for the votes"".Criticising efforts to construct a temple or mosque from the public exchequer, Bhagwat said the Somnath temple was built with money pooled in from society. ""The govt did not fund that (Somnath temple). Ram Mandir was not built by the govt. The govt should not get into the construction of temples,"" he said.","Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday said seeing the Sangh through the lens of BJP would be a ""big mistake"" He tried to define ""Hindus"" and the ""Indian society"" He said: ""We have to organise society and not create any separate organisation within society""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126109684,imgsize-804455,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Kerala government on Sunday strongly condemned reports that some private school managements imposed restrictions on Christmas celebrations and refunded money collected from students for the event.The government also warned that schools would not be allowed to be turned into ""communal laboratories"".Such actions are unheard of in a state like Kerala, which has a high level of democratic consciousness and a long-standing secular tradition, it said.""No one will be permitted to introduce the north Indian models that divide people on the basis of religion or belief in Kerala's educational institutions,"" state General Education Minister V Sivankutty told reporters here.He said schools are spaces where children learn and grow together, cutting across caste and religion, and any attempt to sow divisive ideas among students is unacceptable.Festivals such as Onam, Christmas and Eid have traditionally been celebrated together in the state schools, helping children learn mutual respect, love and coexistence, he said.The decision of certain private school managements to cancel celebrations after collecting money and then refunding them was ""cruel"" and amounts to hurting children.All schools, whether aided or unaided, are bound by the Constitution of India, education rules and laws of the country, and have a responsibility to uphold values of secularism, Sivankutty further said.Warning of strict action against such practices, the minister said schools would not be allowed to function as spaces to serve narrow political or communal interests.""Imposing restrictions selectively on the celebrations of any one community amounts to discrimination and will not be tolerated,"" he said.Sivankutty also reaffirmed that any move that undermines the dignity and tradition of Kerala's public education sector would not be allowed.The minister further said instructions have been given to officials to conduct an urgent inquiry into the matter and submit a report.The General Education minister also said complaints have been received from students and parents regarding the conduct of compulsory special classes in some schools during the upcoming Christmas vacation. Such classes should not be conducted during holidays, he said.","Kerala government strongly condemned reports that some private school managements imposed restrictions on Christmas celebrations.

Candace Owens shares witness claim linking Erika Kirk and Brian Harpole to Fort Huachuca meeting

Erika Kirk’s BIG SLAP To Candace Owens Amid Public Fight On Charlie Kirk’s Death | ‘Egypt Not Here…’





Fresh claims shared by Candace Owens have stirred heavy debate online. On her podcast Candace Owens spoke about a witness who says he saw Erika Kirk in a restricted place just hours before the reported killing of Charlie Kirk . Candace Owens said these claims come from a former special forces operative. The man, identified only as Mitch, said he saw Erika Kirk with Charlie Kirk’s head of security at a military base in Arizona. Owens made it clear this was an eyewitness account shared on her show, not an official finding.Right now, there is no confirmation from police or federal agencies backing these claims. Still, the story has drawn attention because of who is involved and the serious nature of what is being alleged. Candace Owens said she no longer trusts the official version of events and wants answers about what really happened in the final hours before Charlie Kirk’s death.During the podcast, Candace Owens interviewed Mitch, who said he was at Fort Huachuca in early September. He explained that he went there to “get records” and noticed an unusual military presence that day.Mitch said he was questioned by officials and told to leave the area for at least 24 hours.He added that at the time, he did not think much about the people he saw. Everything changed, he claimed, after news broke about Charlie Kirk.“I don’t know these people from TP USA, never been associated with it,” Mitch told Candace Owens. “I could recognise Charlie Kirk, probably.”He continued, “But what I started seeing come across and got more familiar once I saw a picture of somebody in a ponytail with those eyes, that was that person. They were there, and the head of security [Brian Harpole] was one of the people walking out with the congressman.”Mitch said he is “95 to 99 per cent” sure about what he saw. He claimed his confidence comes from strong facial recognition skills. “There’s a picture with Erika Kirk with a ponytail from her past, that person matches who I saw at Fort Huachuca in the lobby,” he said.Candace Owens said these claims raise serious questions about why key people linked to Turning Point USA would be at a secure military site that night. She stressed that she is seeking truth, not politics, and believes the public deserves clear answers.Also Read: “Envious Of Charlie Kirk”: Candace Owens Fires Back At Ben Shapiro As AmFest Clash Shakes Conservative Media","Candace Owens spoke about a witness who says he saw Erika Kirk in a restricted place just hours before the reported killing of Charlie Kirk.

The Donald Trump administration suspended the Green Card lottery program after Claudio Neves Valente, a 48-year-old Portuguese national who came to the US through this lottery pathway was found to be the suspect of Brown University shooting and he also killed an MIT professor. Valente was found dead Thursday evening from a self-inflicted gunshot.Valente entered the US throgh the diversity lottery immigrant visa program in 2017 and was granted a green card, Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem said adding that the 'heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country'.DV1 program is the Green Card lottery, which is meant for people who are born in countries which have historically low immigration to the US. Green Card lottery is not the Green Card program and the suspension of the program does not affect countries like India, China (mainland), because these countries already have a higher immigration rate to the US.The Diversity Visa lottery was a random selection process where 55,000 individuals were granted Green Cards. Nearly 20 million people applied for the 2025 visa lottery, with more than 131,000 selected when including spouses with the winners.After winning, they must undergo vetting to win admission to the United States. Portuguese citizens won only 38 slots.This is a general list of countries which are eligible for Green Card lottery though the list may change every year.

Louvre Robbed, Then THIS: France Stunned as Maison des Lumières Museum Looted in Back-to-Back Heists





Three men are set to stand trial next year over the suspected theft of silverware and valuable tableware from the official residence of the French president, the Paris prosecutor’s office said.The disappearance of items, estimated to be worth between 15,000 and 40,000 euros ($17,500–$46,800), was first reported by the Élysée Palace’s head steward. The stolen pieces included Sèvres porcelain, Baccarat champagne glasses, copper saucepans and a René Lalique statuette, all used during state dinners and official events.Investigations traced the theft to one of the palace’s silver stewards, Thomas M, after staff noticed irregularities in inventory records suggesting potential future thefts, as reported by Reuters.Prosecutors said around 100 objects were recovered from his personal locker, vehicle and home. Among the recovered items were pieces identified by the Sèvres Manufactory on online auction websites.Thomas M and his partner, Damien G, were arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of theft, while another man, Ghislain M, was arrested on charges of receiving stolen goods.Authorities said Ghislain M, a guard at the Louvre Museum, may have been motivated by a “passion” for rare antique objects, according to his lawyer.Investigators also discovered some stolen items listed on Thomas M.’s Vinted account, including a plate stamped “French Air Force” and Sèvres ashtrays not available to the general public. All recovered items have been returned to the Élysée Palace, according to CNN.The three suspects appeared in court on Thursday on charges of jointly stealing movable property listed as part of the national heritage, an offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros, as well as aggravated handling of stolen goods.The trial has been scheduled for February 26. In the meantime, the defendants were placed under judicial supervision, barred from contacting each other, prohibited from attending auction venues and restricted from professional activities.The case has drawn attention amid broader concerns about the security of France’s cultural and historical assets. In October, the Louvre Museum, where Ghislain M works, suffered a high-profile theft of pieces from France’s crown jewels, prompting debate about security measures at national landmarks.","Three men are set to stand trial next year over the suspected theft of silverware from the official residence of the French president.

‘Blocked by the crowd’: Bangladesh police on mob lynching of Hindu worker Dipu; blame 'late call',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/blocked-by-the-crowd-bangladesh-police-on-mob-lynching-of-hindu-worker-dipu-blame-late-call/articleshow/126113574.cms,"Seven Held In Hindu Man’s Lynching in Bangladesh As Yunus Faces Scrutiny Over Minority Safety





Bangladesh police have given a stark account of how a Hindu garment worker was killed by a mob in Mymensingh, admitting that a furious crowd and a massive traffic jam prevented officers from reaching him in time — and suggesting that a delayed call for help may have cost him his life.As reported by The Daily Star, Dipu Chandra Das, 25, was beaten to death on Thursday night after allegations spread that he had “hurt religious sentiments”. Speaking to the newspaper, Md Farhad Hossain Khan, superintendent of Industrial Police in Mymensingh, said he was informed of the incident by an assistant sub-inspector at around 8:00 pm. By then, the situation had spiralled beyond control.Bangladesh law enforcement agencies have arrested two more individuals in connection with the killing of Hindu youth Dipu Chandra Das in Mymensingh, bringing the total number of arrests to 12. According to The Daily Star, the latest arrests were made early Sunday. The suspects, identified as Ashik (25) and Kaium (25), have been handed over to Bhaluka Police Station along with the other detainees.“Immediately, we started running towards the spot, but it was too late. Hundreds of people were on the road, and it was very difficult to reach the place through the huge crowd. When we reached the factory gate, we saw the body being carried by a furious mob towards the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway, about two kilometres away.A 10-kilometre traffic jam was created for nearly three hours, seriously obstructing the movement of law enforcement agencies,” the SP told The Daily Star.He added that his office was about 15 kilometres from the factory, while the local Bhaluka police station was much closer. “Just a timely call could have saved Dipu's life, but it was not made,” he said.The incident took place at Pioneer Knitwears (BD) Ltd in Jamirdia, Bhaluka. According to Sakib Mahmud, the factory’s senior manager (admin), a group of workers began protesting inside the factory around 5:00 pm, accusing Dipu of blasphemy. “There was no proof of the allegations,” Mahmud said, but the protest escalated as hundreds of workers gathered.Around 8:45 pm, agitated people broke open a gate, entered the factory, dragged Dipu out of the security room and assaulted him. Factory sources told The Daily Star that local residents later joined the attack. Dipu was killed on the spot, his body taken to the highway and set on fire.Bangladesh's interim government has condemned the lynching, warning that those responsible “will not be spared”.","Dipu Chandra Das, 25, was beaten to death on Thursday night after allegations spread that he had “hurt religious sentiments’ Police: “Just a timely call could have saved Dipu's life, but it was not made”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126113589,imgsize-984065,width-400,resizemode-4/bangladesh-unrest-ap.jpg"

Caracas, however, views it as an attempt to apply pressure and undermine President Nicolás Maduro’s government.Kristi Noem on Sunday shared the video of US forces rappelling from a helicopter onto the deck of the second vessel within two weeks, stating the US' commitment to pursue ""illicit movement of sanctioned oil."" Noem wrote, ""In a pre-dawn action early this morning on Dec. 20, the US Coast Guard with the support of the Department of War apprehended an oil tanker that was last docked in Venezuela.""On December 10, armed US agents intercepted and took control of an oil tanker named Skipper, which was transporting Venezuelan crude, sailing under a false flag, and already under US sanctions for earlier shipments of Iranian oil.","US officials on Sunday confirmed the pursuit of a third oil tanker from Venezuela.

Former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina reacted to the death of student leader Sharif Usman Hadi, accusing the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government of presiding over “lawlessness” and claiming the violence reflects a breakdown of governance that has worsened since her ouster.In an email interview with ANI, Hasina said the killing of the youth leader underscored a growing culture of violence under the interim administration, warning that the situation was destabilising Bangladesh internally and straining ties with neighbouring countries, particularly India.“This tragic killing reflects the lawlessness that uprooted my government and has multiplied under Yunus. Violence has become the norm while the interim government either denies it or is powerless to stop it. Such incidents destabilise Bangladesh internally but also our relationships with neighbours who are watching with justified alarm. India sees the chaos, the persecution of minorities, and the erosion of everything we built together. When you cannot maintain basic order within your borders, your credibility on the international stage collapses. This is the reality of Yunus's Bangladesh,” Hasina said.Her remarks came after the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a prominent youth leader associated with Bangladesh’s 2024 “July uprising” and spokesperson of the political platform Inqilab Mancho.Hadi was shot at close range by unidentified assailants while travelling in a rickshaw in Dhaka’s Bijoynagar area on December 12. He sustained a critical gunshot injury to the head and was initially treated at Dhaka Medical College Hospital before being shifted to Evercare Hospital as his condition worsened.He was later airlifted to Singapore for advanced treatment and admitted to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit at Singapore General Hospital.Inqilab Mancho announced Hadi’s death in a social media post, stating that he had fought for his life for six days, according to Bangladesh news outlet Daily Star. An aspiring independent candidate from the Dhaka-8 constituency, Hadi emerged as a prominent political figure following last year’s uprising that led to Sheikh Hasina’s removal from office.Hasina also expressed serious concern over the killing of a Hindu youth amid the unrest, linking the incident to what she described as the interim government’s failure to protect minorities and maintain basic law and order.Referring to the lynching of 27-year-old Dipu Chandra Das in Mymensingh district, the former PM held the Yunus-led administration responsible. Das was allegedly beaten to death by a mob over accusations of blasphemy, after which his body was set on fire, triggering nationwide outrage.Hasina said such incidents were contributing to diplomatic strain, particularly with India and accused the interim government of allowing extremists to dictate both domestic and foreign policy.“The strain you are witnessing is entirely of Yunus's making. His government issues hostile statements against India, fails to protect religious minorities, and allows extremists to dictate foreign policy, then expresses surprise when tensions rise. India has been Bangladesh's most steadfast friend and partner for decades. The ties between our nations are deep and fundamental; they will outlast any temporary government,” she said.She further claimed that anti-India hostility was being deliberately fuelled by radical elements emboldened under the current dispensation, pointing to attacks on diplomatic facilities, media houses and minority communities.“This hostility is being manufactured by extremists who have been emboldened by the Yunus regime. These are the same actors who marched on the Indian embassy and attacked our media offices, who attack minorities with impunity, and who forced my family and me to flee for our lives. A responsible government would protect diplomatic missions and prosecute those who threaten them. Instead, Yunus grants immunity to hooligans and calls them warriors,” Hasina alleged.Sheikh Hasina also warned of what she described as the growing influence of radical Islamist forces, claiming the interim government had released convicted terrorists and allowed extremist-linked groups to enter public life, raising alarms about Bangladesh’s secular foundations.""I share this concern, as do the millions of Bangladeshis who prefer the safe, secular state we once were. Yunus has placed extremists in cabinet positions, released convicted terrorists from prison, and allowed groups linked to international terrorist organisations to take roles in public life. He is not a politician and has no experience governing a complex nation. My fear is that radicals are using him to project an acceptable face to the international community while they systematically radicalise our institutions from within,"" Hasina said.Separately, Hasina criticised the interim government’s approach to Pakistan, arguing that major foreign policy shifts were being pursued without democratic legitimacy.She said that Bangladesh had long adhered to a balanced diplomatic principle but accused Yunus of moving hastily to reorient ties after alienating traditional allies.“Bangladesh has always believed in friendship to all, malice toward none. Of course it makes sense for our country to have a stable relationship with Pakistan, but Yunus’ headlong embrace is inappropriate. Having needlessly alienated many of our longstanding allies, he now seems desperate to find a friend on the world stage,” Hasina said.She further stressed that the interim administration lacked the mandate to undertake strategic realignments that could have long-term consequences.“The crucial point is this: Yunus has no mandate to realign Bangladesh's foreign policy. He was not elected, so he has no right to make strategic decisions that could impact generations. Once Bangladeshis can vote freely again, our foreign policy will return to serving our national interests, not the ideological fantasies of extremists who have temporarily seized power. The ties between Bangladesh and India are fundamental and will endure long after this interim government is gone,” she added.","Sheikh Hasina has reacted to the death of student leader Sharif Usman Hadi. She accused the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government of presiding over ‘lawlessness’ Hasina said the situation was destabilising Bangladesh internally and straining ties with neighbouring countries, particularly India.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126112709,imgsize-1245573,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

What to expect next?





The UAE is experiencing unstable weather today as a low-pressure system continues to affect much of the country, bringing heavy rain, thunderstorms, lightning and hail in some areas. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has forecast this pattern to persist through Friday, with scattered showers and varying rain intensity across emirates including Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and the northern regions. Winds are moderate to strong at times, stirring dust and reducing visibility, while sea conditions remain rough along the coast.This unsettled weather follows days of rain and cloud activity, and residents should expect spotty downpours and wet conditions throughout the day.Authorities across the UAE have issued strong safety advisories, urging residents to remain cautious:The National Centre of Meteorology advised people to avoid outdoor activities during thunderstorms and stay updated through official channels.Police departments in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah warned motorists to reduce speed, maintain safe distances and avoid flooded roads, stressing that water-logged streets can be deceptively dangerous.Civil Defence teams across several emirates remain on standby, responding to weather-related incidents and assisting affected areas.Residents were also advised to stay away from wadis and low-lying areas, where fast-moving water poses serious risks.If you were planning to commute between emirates today, you might need to rethink your schedule. Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has officially suspended intercity bus services to Sharjah and Ajman until further notice. This decision was made to keep passengers safe as visibility drops and water accumulates on major highways. While public buses within Dubai are still operating, the RTA warns that commuters should expect significant delays.The disruption isn't just on the roads; it has reached the skies as well. At Dubai International (DXB), Emirates and flydubai have been forced to cancel or reschedule multiple flights due to the unstable conditions. Passengers are being urged to check their flight status online before even heading to the airport, as access roads are also facing heavy traffic and localized flooding. In Abu Dhabi, Zayed International Airport is also on high alert, with authorities advising travelers to allow extra time for their journey.According to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM), the umbrella-weather isn't going away just yet. The unstable conditions are expected to persist throughout Saturday, December 20, particularly in coastal, northern, and eastern areas. Winds could reach speeds of up to 50 km/h, and the seas will remain rough, making any maritime activity dangerous.As the UAE navigates this stormy period, the sense of community resilience is high. Authorities continue to provide minute-by-minute updates on social media, reminding everyone that while the rain may be heavy, the safety measures in place are even stronger.","The UAE is experiencing unstable weather today as a low-pressure system continues to affect much of the country.

Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in the Bangladesh protest and ousting of Sheikh Hasina, died on Thursday in Singapore (local time), according to a press release from Singapore's ministry of foreign affairs. He had been after fighting for his life for six days following a shooting in Dhaka.Sharif Osman Hadi, a spokesperson for Inqilab Monchoan, was shot earlier this month. He was initially taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital and later shifted to Evercare Hospital as his condition deteriorated. Last Saturday, Hadi was airlifted to Singapore for advanced treatment, but he succumbed to his injuries on Thursday night.Sharif Osman Hadi was a key leader of the July Uprising that played a central role in toppling the previous Awami League government. He served as the spokesperson of Inqilab Mancha, a political platform that emerged from the protest movement, and was being considered a candidate for the upcoming general elections.Hadi was shot in the head on December 12 while campaigning in central Dhaka. Investigators said an assailant on a motorcycle opened fire at him as he travelled in a battery-powered rickshaw to conduct electioneering, reported Dhaka Tribune.He was first taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where doctors carried out emergency brain surgery, describing his condition as “extremely critical.”He was later shifted to Evercare Hospital and airlifted to Singapore on December 15 for advanced treatment. Doctors said the bullet had caused severe damage to the brain stem. After battling for life for six days, Hadi succumbed to his injuries at a Singapore hospital, PTI reported.With regards to the shooting, he was targeted while travelling in a battery-run auto-rickshaw in Dhaka’s Paltan area.Hadi’s death triggered widespread protests in Dhaka, with hundreds of students and supporters gathering at Shahbagh intersection chanting slogans in his name, as per PTI.Student groups and political outfits linked to last year’s protest movement accused the authorities of failing to ensure security and demanded swift arrests of those responsible.Protests later escalated, with reports of vandalism at media offices in the capital and attacks on properties linked to political figures in different parts of the country. The interim government appealed for calm, urging citizens to allow law enforcement agencies to conduct investigations professionally.Yunus described Hadi’s killing as an “irreparable loss” to Bangladesh’s democratic landscape and called for unity, restraint and patience. “No one will be able to halt this nation’s democratic progress through fear, terror or bloodshed,” he said, adding that advancing democracy would be the true tribute to Sharif Osman Hadi, reported ANI.","Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in the Bangladesh protest and ousting of Sheikh Hasina, died on Thursday in Singapore.

Elise Stefanik exits politics: Donald Trump’s ally quits New York governor race — but why?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elise-stefanik-exits-politics-donald-trumps-ally-quits-new-york-governor-race-but-why/articleshow/126088298.cms,"Mamdani Distances Himself As NYC Official Quits In Disgrace Over ‘Indefensible’ Anti-Jew Posts





US President Donald Trump’s ally Elise Stefanik has opted to leave politics and said she will no longer run for New York governor.House Republican Conference chair and fourth-ranking member in the House of Representatives, Stefanik said on Friday she was bowing out of politics to spend more time with family.She added that she would halt the gubernatorial campaign, that was launched in November, and would not seek re-election to Congress.When her current term representing New York’s upstate 21st congressional district expires in January 2027, she will have served 12 years in office on Capitol Hill.Stefanik’s decision followed a holiday advertising blitz by her Republican rival in the gubernatorial primary, Nassau County executive and fellow Trump ally Bruce Blakeman, who paid to air campaign ads on Fox News in West Palm Beach, Florida, the home of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence.President Donald Trump has previously expressed consternation at having to choose between two allies to challenge New York’s incumbent Democratic Governor, Kathy Hochul, next November. “They’re two fantastic people, and I always hate it when two very good friends of mine are running, and I hope there’s not a lot of damage done,” the New York Times quoted him as telling reporters recently.While voicing confidence that she would have “overwhelmingly won” that race, Stefanik said in her announcement, “it is not an effective use of our time or your generous resources to spend the first half of next year in an unnecessary and protracted Republican primary, especially in a challenging state like New York.”Stefanik went on to say that throughout her time in Congress, her “most important title is Mom.” “I believe that being a parent is life’s greatest gift and greatest responsibility,” she wrote. “I have thought deeply about this and I know that as a mother, I will feel profound regret if I don’t further focus on my young son’s safety, growth, and happiness - particularly at his tender age.”Shortly after Stefanik bowed out, President Trump acknowledged her announcement on his Truth Social platform, writing “Elise is a tremendous talent, regardless of what she does. She will have GREAT success, and I am with her all the way!”Stefanik, the youngest woman ever elected to the House in 2014, moved sharply to the right after Trump’s first presidential victory in 2016. She has led efforts to expose how elite U.S. colleges, including New York’s Columbia University, responded to campus protests over the Gaza war.

Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner pitches $112bn plan to turn Gaza rubble into a tech hub,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-son-in-law-jared-kushner-pitches-112bn-plan-to-turn-gaza-rubble-into-a-tech-hub/articleshow/126109928.cms,"Hamas Refuses To End Gaza Fight? Netanyahu Gets Chilling Warning | ‘3rd INTIFADA Would Break Out’





Jared Kushner, former senior adviser to Donald Trump, is pitching a $112 billion proposal to rebuild the war-ravaged Gaza Strip into a futuristic technology and tourism hub, according to details first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Kushner, 44, alongside US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, has been presenting a 32-slide PowerPoint titled Project Sunrise: Building a New and Unified Gaza to regional governments, including Turkey, Egypt and wealthy Gulf states. The document outlines a vision of Gaza transformed into a gleaming coastal metropolis featuring high-speed rail, AI-driven energy grids and luxury beachside resorts.The plan estimates a total redevelopment cost of $112.1 billion over ten years. US support would cover roughly 20 per cent of direct funding, alongside additional loan guarantees and financial backstops that could bring Washington’s total exposure to nearly $60 billion.The plan frames Gaza as a future investment destination and tourism hotspot but provides few concrete details about governance or long-term political arrangements. It also does not clearly explain where Gaza’s roughly two million displaced Palestinians would live during reconstruction, noting only that they would be housed in “temporary shelter, field hospitals and mobile clinics”.The White House declined to comment directly on the proposal. However, spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said that the Trump administration remained committed to “laying the groundwork for a peaceful and prosperous Gaza”.Middle East analysts have cast serious doubt on whether the proposal is viable. Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow Steven Cook said the project cannot move forward without the disarmament of Hamas, which he described as unlikely.That condition is acknowledged within the presentation itself. The plan is explicitly tied to Hamas disarming, a requirement embedded in a broader, phased peace framework proposed by the Trump administration. Hamas has so far refused to lay down its weapons, effectively stalling further progress.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio echoed those concerns, warning that investors would not commit funds if Gaza risks returning to war within a few years.“You are not going to convince anyone to invest money in Gaza if they believe another war is going to happen,” Rubio said.Even if political hurdles were cleared, the physical challenges remain immense. Reconstruction would require clearing an estimated 68 million tonnes of debris, removing unexploded ordnance and landmines, and recovering the bodies of Palestinians killed during the conflict.Images from areas such as Khan Younis show vast stretches of flattened neighbourhoods, underscoring the scale of destruction that any redevelopment effort would have to overcome.Kushner and Witkoff have previously used private business networks in diplomatic efforts, including during negotiations related to the Israel-Hamas conflict and, more recently, exploratory talks linked to the Russia-Ukraine war. Whether their glossy vision for Gaza can move beyond PowerPoint slides and into reality, however, remains deeply uncertain.","Jared Kushner, former senior adviser to Donald Trump, is pitching a $112 billion proposal to rebuild the war-ravaged Gaza Strip.

"'Trump had nothing to do with Epstein files': DOJ defends redacting US president’s photo, then republishes it",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-had-nothing-to-do-with-epstein-files-doj-defends-redacting-us-presidents-photo-then-republishes-it/articleshow/126109922.cms,"Trump's DOJ Under Fire: 16 Files 'GO MISSING' From Epstein Library Within 24 Hours Of Release





US deputy attorney General Todd Blanche has insisted that the Justice Department’s decision to remove over a dozen photographs from the recent release of Jeffrey Epstein files “has nothing to do with President [Donald] Trump. ”He said the move came at the request of victim advocacy groups, according to NBC News.The photos were re-released by the DOJ. In a post on X, the department said: ""The Southern District of New York flagged an image of President Trump for potential further action to protect victims.""It added: ""Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review. After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.""Blanche explained that the photographs were taken down on Saturday only temporarily and included un-redacted images of women. “The photo will go back up” once Justice Department officials complete their review and determine whether further redactions are needed.On Saturday, NBC News confirmed that 15 images released on Friday had been removed from the department’s website.One of the removed files included a photo of a tabletop covered in framed pictures of Epstein with famous individuals, including printed photos of Trump with women in bathing suits inside an open drawer. “Blanche told NBC News’ Meet the Press on Sunday DOJ is still investigating that particular photo: ""We don’t have perfect information.And so when, when we hear from victims-rights groups about this type of photograph, we pull it down and investigate. We’re still investigating that photo. The photo will go back up, and the only question is whether there will be redactions on the photo.”Blanche also pushed back against criticism from Democrats over the Justice Department’s partial release of the Epstein files on Friday, which was the deadline under the Epstein Files Transparency Act set 30 days ago. He said delays were necessary to protect victims and their privacy.Lawmaker Ro Khanna was disappointed with the partial release and called on Blanche and Attorney General Pam Bondi to agree on the full release. Dick Durbin and Shri Thanedar criticised the department for violating the law and condemned the lack of transparency initially promised by MAGA base.Republican Thomas Massie called the removal of documents “government lies,” while former Trump aide Marjorie Taylor Greene criticised the slow release, posting that it was “NOT MAGA.”Blanche pushed back against all claims of a cover-up. “I have no reason to believe that the lawyers that were working on this case were talking about President Trump, because he had nothing to do with the Epstein files. He had nothing to do with the horrific crimes that Mr. Epstein committed,” he said.He reiterated that DOJ is not withholding information intentionally: “We are not redacting information around President Trump, around any other individual involved with Mr. Epstein, and that narrative, which is not based on fact at all, is completely false.”",Deputy attorney general Todd Blanche said the move came at the request of victim advocacy groups.

Vice president JD Vance once again stirred a row after asserting at the Turning Point USA AmericaFest event that the United States is and always will be a Christian nation.Speaking to the mostly Republican crowd, Vance said, “The only thing that is truly served as an anchor of the United States of America is that we have been, and by the grace of God, we always will be, a Christian nation. ” The MAGA audience responded with loud applause and cheers.The remarks come after Vance said in October that he hopes his wife, Usha Vance, who was raised in a Hindu family may convert into Christianity. Speaking at one older Turning Point USA event, Vance said he hopes she may one day embrace Christianity, but said that faith must be freely chosen. He had said: “Now most Sundays Usha will come with me to church… Do I hope, eventually, that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved in by church? Yeah, I honestly do wish that because I believe in the Christian gospel and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way. ”These comments had ignited a firestorm within the MAGA base and divided conservatives on how a White nationalist Christian leader can have a Brown Hindu and Indian wife.Democrats, progressives, and American Hindu groups condemned the statements and said they were insensitive to Usha’s religious identity and showed elements of forceful Christian nationalist rhetoric. Hindu American Foundation said that sharing faith in a marriage should be mutual rather than one-sided.Vance shut down the false rumours and responded on social media that Usha has ""no plans to convert."" He called the backlash “disgusting” and described it as anti-Christian bigotry. He said that he loves his wife, Usha, and reiterated that he respects her beliefs.Vance has openly discussed how Usha supported him when he returned to faith, as both were once agnostic before he converted to Catholicism in 2019. He has credited her and her Indian-origin family’s values with influencing his spiritual journey.However, the comments were not appreciated on social media when users pointed out the irony of how a GOP leader can preach about a Christian nation while having a Hindu wife.","JD Vance said the United States is and always will be a Christian nation.

Is Vivek Ramaswamy an anchor baby? What does the term mean?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-vivek-ramaswamy-an-anchor-baby-what-does-the-term-mean/articleshow/126109825.cms,"Usha Vance J**t Slur Sparks Firestorm: Vivek Ramaswamy’s Outburst Splits MAGA | ‘You Have No Place…’

Nick Fuentes dubs Vivek Ramaswamy an 'anchor baby'



What is an anchor baby?



The origin of the term



Is Vivek Ramaswamy an 'anchor baby'?



Why is the term still in use?







If there's one crackdown Trump has taken seriously, it's on illegal immigration. One could almost say that during his second term, the President has been making most headlines revolving around the issue, followed by the infamous tariffs. For MAGA minds and conservative consciences, there has been no better time than now to share just how they feel about immigration and a term that has risen from the dead is, anchor baby.This two-worded term is more than just a phrase, it's an ideology mixed with an identity and a hint of indignation. In recent days, this term has largely been associated with Indian-origin entrepreneur, former Republican presidential candidate and conservative intellectual, Vivek Ramaswamy Popular far-right activist, Nick Fuentes launched a racist attack on Ramaswamy after the Republican leader's recent New York Times op-ed.""Americanness isn’t a scalar quality that varies based on your ancestry. It’s binary: Either you’re an American or you’re not. You are an American if you believe in the rule of law, in freedom of conscience and freedom of expression, in colorblind meritocracy, in the U.S. Constitution, in the American dream, and if you are a citizen who swears exclusive allegiance to our nation,"" wrote Ramaswamy in his op-ed.Fuentes took to X to share his thoughts on the same and wrote, “Reminder that Vivek Ramaswamy is an actual anchor baby, so everything he says can be completely disregarded. Foreigners who have no right to be here don’t get to lecture me about what it is to be American.”According to Dictionary.com, 'anchor baby' is a term used to refer to a baby born to an undocumented mother in a country where the baby becomes a citizen at birth, especially when the birth is planned to facilitate eventual legal residency for the family.In 2011, the term was even added to the New American Heritage Dictionary's recently published fifth edition, solidifying its place in American politics. The term is widely regarded as derogatory and offensive. In simpler terms, it refers to a child born in a country that grants birthright citizenship, like the US, to non-citizen parents, implying the child exists only to grant them legal citizenship in the future.Who coined the term anchor baby? Well, the world would love to know. But how did it become famous? That's a story to tell. Some earlier ideas along the term came in the 1980s. They were used to refer to Southeast Asian immigrant teens who came to the U.S. to help and support their family members back home, as per a 2011 analysis of the term by independent researcher Alexander Williams and Stanford professor Gave Ignatow.It was in 2006 that the term as we know it came about. In late 2005, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill requiring a 700-mile fence on the border and raising penalties for illegal immigration. A few months later, the Republican-controlled Senate passed a bill giving some illegal immigrants a path to legal status. While neither became a law, they led to protests and debates where the term 'anchor baby' became a common term.Yes, this is the question you might have read all of the above for, or scrolled down directly to. Let's delve in. Vivek Ramaswamy was born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio.His father, V. Ganapathy Ramaswamy, a National Institute of Technology Calicut graduate, built a career as an engineer and patent attorney at General Electric, his mother Geetha Ramaswamy, a graduate of Mysore Medical College & Research Institute, who worked as a geriatric psychiatrist, immigrated to the U.S. from Kerala, India, legally. According to the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, a child born on U.S. soil has U.S. citizenship.In a 2024 conversation with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds at the Iowa State Fair in August, Ramaswamy shared that his father is not a U.S. citizen and never took the test, a choice he ""made for familial reasons."" However, his mother took the citizenship test and was naturalised as a citizen.Considering only one of his parents holds a U.S. citizenship, factually, Vivek Ramaswamy is not an anchor baby. Adding the fact that the term is a political slur and heavily loaded with derogatory meaning, it is just another verbal ammunition for the supporters of the conservative immigration rhetoric and not one that should be used in regard to the Republican.With immigration still being one of the most strategically politicised, publicly debated and critically condemned issues in America, any related term is welcomed. But what makes 'anchor baby' special is the fact that it raises a question that gets the blood boiling, ""Who is an American?""With that comes all the added ones, like who pays the taxes, who votes, who plans a family, who gets educated, who has a government and who is protected by the military. It's a loaded moral question for a nation that was established by foreigners.But considering the now of America, which is filled with ICE raids and arrests, H-1B uprooting and penalising policy decisions, 'anchor baby' is a term that shows just how a section of people love categorising and offending others to feed their own ideology.","Vivek Ramaswamy, former Republican presidential candidate and conservative intellectual, was called an 'anchor baby' by far-right activist Nick Fuentes. The term refers to a child born in a country that grants birthright citizenship, like the US, to non-citizen parents.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126109826,imgsize-30622,width-400,resizemode-4/is-vivek-ramaswamy-an-anchor-baby-what-does-the-term-mean.jpg"

Robinson has also been charged with obstruction of justice and other offences.

Who is Mehek Cooke?





Indian-origin MAGA lawyer and 'Trump surrogate' Mehek Cooke weighed in on the growing debate inside the US conservative movement, saying that 'Americanness ' cannot be ranked by ancestry. She backed GOP leader and fellow Indian-American Vivek Ramaswamy ’s rejection of “heritage Americanism”.Posting on X, Cooke said that she came into the US legally and embraced the American culture: “I am American. I came here legally and assimilated, our laws, culture, and shared standards. No one gets to rank my Americanness. The real divide is not heritage. It is legality and assimilation. Spoke with Vivek Ramaswamy backstage after his speech. That clarity wins.”Her comments came after Ramaswamy delivered a fiery speech at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest event, where he criticised racism and antisemitism within sections of the right-wing movement, especially after recent comments of White nationalist and right-winger Nick Fuentes, who called vice president JD Vance's Hindu-Indian wife Usha a ""jeet.""Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek spoke to thousands of young conservatives and rejected the idea that Americans with colonial-era roots.He claimed that there is no reason someone is less of an American just because their families migrated more recently into the States.“The idea of a heritage American is about as loony as anything the woke left has actually put up,” Ramaswamy compared the idea of heritage American to ""woke left"" during the address. He used an example of the MAGA chief himself: “It leads you to believe that Donald Trump is less of an American than Joe Biden, because Donald Trump’s mother was an immigrant.”Ramaswamy condemned hatred directed at any ethnic or religious group: “If you believe in normalizing hatred towards any ethnic group, towards whites, towards blacks, towards Hispanics, towards Jews, towards Indians, you have no place in the future of the conservative movement.""Mehek Cooke was born in India and moved to the United States as a child, later growing up in Ohio.
