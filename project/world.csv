NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act being invoked in cases of consenting adolescent romantic relations, Supreme Court said on Tuesday there was a need to spread awareness among students about the issue and hinted that it would pass directions.""The Pocso Act is being misused in cases of marital discord and matters pertaining to consensual relationships between adolescents. The law is being thrust upon boys.

""It must be made mandatory in all schools whether aided or unaided, whether they have classes on sex education or not, to educate the children about the folly and drastic consequences of rape, including creating awareness that violating the privacy of the other sex would be considered wrong and derogatory and that it amounts to a crime,"" the petition said.The bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan directed states to file responses to a PIL seeking its intervention to direct the govt to make people aware about the law.Advocate Sandeep Sudhakar Deshmukh, appearing for the petitioner, said the country continues to witness a disturbing surge of rapes and crimes against women and girls.""It must be made mandatory in all schools whether aided or unaided, whether they have classes on sex education or not, to educate the children about the folly and drastic consequences of rape, including creating awareness that violating the privacy of the other sex would be considered wrong and derogatory and that it amounts to a crime,"" the petition said.

Last week, the court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution and acquitted a man charged under the Pocso Act after noting that the couple was happily married.

When Love Turns Lethal: Inside India’s Honeymoon Murders | The Silent Crisis No One Talks About





BENGALURU: ""I killed my wife for you."" Dr Mahendra Reddy GS, main accused in the murder of his dermatologist-wife Kruthila Reddy, sent out this cryptic and loaded message to at least 4-5 women, including a medical professional who had spurned his proposal, weeks after his wife's death.In a desperate bid to give marriage a second start, Mahendra got in touch with women, who had earlier dumped him, and came back from the dead to make renewed proposals to half-a-dozen women.According to police, Mahendra administered anaesthesia and killed his wife Kruthika, 29, on April 24. He was arrested on Oct 14 from Manipal, Udupi district, for his wife's death.Police said Mahendra had messaged ‘I killed my wife for you' to the medical professional — not a doctor — through a digital-payment app after she had blocked him on multiple messaging platforms.Police have seized his mobile phone and laptop and sent them to a forensic science laboratory. The data revealed his messages to the woman.Deputy commissioner of police (Whitefield) K Parashurama confirmed the messages were sent through PhonePe, a digital-payment app. The woman's statement has been recorded, but police are not revealing any details due to the ongoing investigation.The woman reportedly told police that she had blocked Mahendra before his marriage.After learning about his marriage to Kruthika, the woman stayed away from him. However, he messaged ‘a confession' to her a couple of months after killing his wife. Until Mahendra was arrested on murder charges, the woman had assumed he was falsely confessing to the murder only with an intention to talk to her, a senior police officer said, adding the woman has no role in the crime.Investigating officers found that Mahendra was also in contact with a Mumbai-based woman until 2023. He proposed to marry her and met her a few times. Later, he made his father call and inform her that he had ""died in an accident"". After that, he was not in contact with her.However, Mahendra rose from the ashes and called her in Sept to confirm he was not dead. Instead, according to his astrological chart, his first wife was going to die. Since his ""love for her was genuine"", he told her that he had lied to her and got married to Kruthika. As his wife was dead now, he said that he wanted to marry her.","Dr Mahendra Reddy GS, main accused in the murder of his dermatologist-wife Kruthila Reddy, sent out this cryptic and loaded message to at least 4-5 women, including a medical professional.

'Will Cut Off Your Tongue': Bihar Poll Campaign Turns Ugly, AIMIM Candidate Threatens Tejashwi Yadav

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday made a striking claim in Bihar, alleging that country's 10 per cent, referring to upper castes, ""hold control over the Army.""Addressing a poll rally in Aurangabad's Kutumba, Rahul said, ""90 per cent of the people come from extremely backward, backward, Dalit, and Adivasi communities."" He went on to assert that these groups - forming the vast majority of India's population - remain largely excluded from power and privilege.""All the wealth goes to them, all the jobs go to them.

Party spokesperson Suresh Nakhua, in a post on X, said, ""Rahul Gandhi is now searching for caste in the Armed Forces and says 10% of people control it.

In different parts of the country, people from Bihar are building large buildings, roads, tunnels, and factories,"" he said.Accusing the state government of failing its people, Rahul added, ""In other words, the truth is this—that Nitish Kumar has wiped out employment here and turned the people of Bihar into the country’s labourers.""","Lok Sabha leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi made a striking claim in Bihar, alleging that country's 10 per cent, referring to upper castes, ""hold control over the Army"" Rahul said, ""90 per cent of the people come from extremely backward, backward, Dalit, and Adivasi communities""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125088839,imgsize-652610,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-26.jpg"

‘Trump’s Team In Serious Discussions With India’: White House As India-US Trade Talks Continue





The White House on Tuesday said US President Donald Trump remains committed to strengthening ties with India and is in frequent contact with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, even as differences continue over trade tariffs and oil imports from Russia.WHite House also called the India-US partnership one that the President values “very strongly,”At a press briefing on Tuesday (local time), White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, ""The President is positive and feels very strongly about the India-US relationship. A few weeks ago, he spoke to the Prime Minister directly when he celebrated Diwali in the Oval Office with many high-ranking Indian-American officials here at the White House.""Leavitt added that the US has ""a great Ambassador to India, Sergio Gor,"" and confirmed that Trump’s trade team is in “very serious discussions” with New Delhi. “I know the President has great respect for Prime Minister Modi and they speak pretty frequently,” she said.Her remarks come days after Trump claimed India had reduced its purchase of Russian oil, describing New Delhi as “very good” on the issue during his five-day Asia tour.Since mid-October, Trump has repeatedly said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured him India would limit or stop crude imports from Moscow.Trump’s statements are linked to his administration’s efforts to isolate Russia economically through sanctions and energy restrictions amid the war in Ukraine.However, earlier this month, ministry of external affairs (MEA) responded to Trump’s comments, saying that the country’s energy sourcing decisions are driven by national interests and consumer welfare.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “India is a significant importer of oil and gas. It has been our consistent priority to safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario. Our import policies are guided entirely by this objective.”He added that India’s energy policy aims to ensure stable prices and secure supplies through diversified sourcing. “Where the US is concerned, we have for many years sought to expand our energy procurement. This has steadily progressed in the last decade. The current Administration has shown interest in deepening energy cooperation with India. Discussions are ongoing,” Jaiswal said.Ties between India and the US have come under strain after Washington imposed high trade tariffs on New Delhi in August. The US levied 50 per cent tariffs, including 25 per cent secondary duties, as a response to India’s continued oil trade with Russia.India criticised the move as “unfair, unjustified, and unreasonable,” while Trump described US-India trade ties as a “totally one-sided disaster.”","US President Donald Trump remains committed to strengthening ties with India, White House says.

The petitioners argued that under Muslim personal law, a man is entitled to have up to four wives at a time.HC held that the registrar shall not register a second marriage if the first wife objected on the grounds that it was invalid. Instead, the parties must be referred to the competent civil court to establish the validity of the marriage.Even under Muslim personal law, a man may marry a second time only under specific conditions, HC observed. It noted that neither the Holy Quran nor Muslim law permitted a man to have an extramarital relationship or to contract another marriage without the knowledge of his first wife. HC noted that a Muslim wife could not remain a silent spectator. ""In such matters, religion is secondary and constitutional rights are supreme,"" HC said, adding that ""99.99% of Muslim women will be against their husband's second marriage when their marital relationship is still in existence. ""HC also held that under Muslim personal law, a man may marry more than one wife only if he has the means to maintain them. The bench subsequently dismissed the petition, noting that the first wife had not been made a party to the case.","Kerala HC: A Muslim man cannot register his second marriage without notifying his first wife.

The opposition demanded that the polls be postponed.""There will be no injustice towards any voter or political party. We have to finish the polls by Jan 31 in view of SC order,"" said state election commissioner Waghmare. He said SEC had no role in adding and deleting names to the voter list since this was the task of ECI's Chief Electoral Office. ""We can only adopt the voter list existing on the cut-off date of July 1, which we have chosen,"" he said.However, he said SEC had used software that identified duplicate names which had been marked with two stars on the voter lists in wards.VVPATS will not be used in any phase of the local body polls. Waghmare said a mobile app had been created for voters to search their name in the voter list. They could also find their names on http://mahasecvoterlist.in.",Polls to 246 municipal councils and 42 nagar parishads on December 2.

'Paid Campaign': Nitin Gadkari Slams Criticism Of E20 Program; Calls It 'Politically Motivated'

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Tuesday took a swipe at Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari over his repeated promises to the people of Bihar, remarking that “it seems the highway man is always high.”Mocking Gadkari’s claims, Congress leader Pawan Khera shared a video on X compiling the minister’s old and recent statements in poll-bound Bihar, where he pledged to build “world-class” roads and assured the public that “the roads will be at par with American roads.”The video juxtaposed Gadkari’s promises from 2024 with his latest assurances during the ongoing election campaign in Bihar.Joining the attack, the Kerala Congress also took a jibe at the Union minister, calling him “the new jumla king in town.”Meanwhile, campaigning for the first phase of polling has concluded. Bihar will vote in the first phase on November 6 and the second on November 11, with counting of votes and announcement of results scheduled for November 14.","Congress leader Pawan Khera shared a video compiling the minister’s old and recent statements in poll-bound Bihar.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Shashi Tharoor ’s fresh call to end “dynastic politics” and move toward “meritocracy” has drawn sharp reactions from within his own party.Congress MP Pramod Tiwari said that former Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi from the Nehru family sacrificed their lives. He also asked Tharoor to name any other family in India which had the dedication and ability like the Nehru family.""Leadership always comes from merit. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was the most capable Prime Minister of this country. Indira Gandhi proved herself by sacrificing her life,"" Tiwari said.""Rajiv Gandhi served this country by sacrificing his life. So, if someone talks about the Gandhi family as a dynasty, then which other family in India had the sacrifice, dedication, and ability that this family possessed? Was it BJP?"" he asked.Congress leader Rashid Alvi also interjected Tharoor and said that the public makes decisions in a democracy and no one can be restricted from contesting elections because their father was an MP.""The public makes the decisions in a democracy. You cannot impose a restriction that says you cannot contest elections because your father was an MP. This is happening in every field. What way will you find this?"" Alvi said.Congress leader Udit Raj said that dynastic approach isn't limited to politics and spreads across sectors in the country.""A doctor's son becomes a doctor, a businessman's child continues in business, and politics is no exception. Also, if a politician has a criminal background, it reflects the reality of our society. Election tickets are often distributed along caste and family lines,"" Udit raj told news agency ANI.This comes after Tharoor, in an article, pointed out that while the Nehru-Gandhi family is associated with the Congress, dynastic succession prevails across the political spectrum.He said that when political power is determined by lineage rather than ability, commitment, or grassroots engagement, the quality of governance suffers.He said the influence of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty -- including independent India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, prime ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, and current opposition leader Rahul Gandhi and MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra -- is bound up with the history of India's struggle for freedom.""But it has also cemented the idea that political leadership can be a birthright. This idea has penetrated Indian politics across every party, in every region, and at every level,"" Tharoor said.Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party seized on to Tharoor's remarks, calling it a ""very insightful piece"" on how Indian politics has become a family business.""He (Tharoor) has launched a direct attack on India's nepo kid Rahul and chota nepo kid Tejaswi Yadav!"" BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said.Tharoor’s relationship with the Congress leadership has been under strain since he contested the party president election against Mallikarjun Kharge.The friction reportedly intensified when his name did not appear on the list of Congress leaders suggested for the Union government's Operation Sindoor outreach.Despite this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi later invited Tharoor to lead a delegation to the United States and other countries in the Americas. Tharoor's public statements, including those interpreted as favourable towards the Prime Minister, have also caused discomfort within the CongressThe rift came into sharper focus following his recent remarks and social media posts that appeared to challenge the party’s leadership.","Congress MP Pramod Tiwari said that former Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi from the Nehru family sacrificed their lives.

A UPS cargo plane carrying 4 crew members crashed shortly after takeoff from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport on Tuesday evening, erupting into flames and sending thick black smoke billowing over the area.The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft, bound for Hawaii, went down around 5:15 pm local time (3:45 am IST), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will lead the investigation into the cause of the crash.According to CNN, Kentucky governor Andy Beshear confirmed at least three fatalities and 11 injuries, warning that “that number is going to get larger.” He added that some of the injuries were “very significant.” Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said earlier that there were “multiple injuries and the fire is still burning,” noting that “every emergency agency” was responding to the scene.Beshear urged people to pray that casualties remain low. “Let’s pray that the number of Kentuckians, or any other folks that we lost, stays as low as possible,” he said. “Anybody who has seen the images in the video know how violent this crash is, and there are a lot of families that are going to be waiting and wondering for a period of time.”UPS confirmed that three crew members were on board, saying, “we have not confirmed any injuries/casualties.” The company said it was working with authorities to gather more information.Video footage from local broadcaster WLKY appeared to show the aircraft’s left engine on fire as it attempted to lift off. Aerial visuals from the scene showed a long trail of debris with firefighters battling the blaze.Louisville serves as the main US air hub for UPS, which operates nearly 2,000 flights daily to over 200 countries. The logistics giant has a fleet of 516 aircraft, including 294 owned planes and the rest under leases or charters.The crash occurred as the United States continues to face a prolonged government shutdown that has disrupted aviation operations. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy earlier warned of “mass chaos” due to a shortage of air traffic control staff. “You’ll see mass cancellations, and you may see us close certain parts of the airspace, because we just cannot manage it because we don't have the air traffic controllers,” Duffy said.In a post on X, Duffy described footage of the crash as “heartbreaking,” adding, “Please join me in prayer for the Louisville community and flight crew impacted by this horrific crash.”In January, an American Eagle airliner collided with a military Black Hawk helicopter near Washington’s Ronald Reagan Airport, killing 67 people — ending a 16-year streak without fatal commercial air crashes in the United States and raising concerns about the strain on the nation’s air traffic control system.(With inputs from AFP and CNN)","A UPS cargo plane carrying 4 crew members crashed shortly after takeoff from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport on Tuesday evening.

Trump vs Mamdani





US President Donald Trump 's political foe Zohran Mamdani on Tuesday won the New York City mayoral election, defeating former governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.34-year-old Mamdani will be New York City's youngest and first Muslim mayor. He will replace Mayor Eric Adams, who dropped his re-election bid in September but remained on the ballot.A state assembly member from Queens, Mamdani had entered the contest a year ago as little more than a protest candidate with a thin résumé and virtually no citywide profile.Turnout surged past 2 million voters, the highest level of participation in one of the city's mayoral elections since 1969.Meanwhile, Trump shrugged off Mamdani's victory claiming that US government shutdown was one of the reasons why Republicans lost the polls.Citing pollsters, Trump said ,""Trump wasn’t on the ballot, and shutdown, were the two reasons that Republicans lost elections tonight.""The municipal election turned into a direct fight between Trump and Mamdani. Trump has repeatedly referred to Mamdani as a “Communist lunatic” and a “disaster waiting to happen.” Mamdani, for his part, told The Good Liars in a recent interview that he would “work with the president for the sake of New Yorkers” but “not be cowed.”“If you want to make life more difficult for New Yorkers,” he said, “then I’ll be there to fight you. ”Trump also urged voters to back Cuomo to block Mamdani’s victory. “Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice,” Trump wrote. “You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job.” He warned that if Mamdani wins, federal funds to New York could be at risk.Trump also said that he will cut federal funding to New York if Mamdani wins the election. He also endorsed former New York State governor Andrew Cuomo for the top city post.""If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home, because of the fact that, as a Communist, this once great City has ZERO chance of success, or even survival!"" Trump wrote in a post.New York City, spanning Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island — is home to over 8 million people and stands as one of the world’s most influential urban centres. Its cultural and economic reach extends far beyond the United States, making it a global capital of finance, technology, and the arts.The mayor’s role is therefore of immense importance. With an annual budget of around $116 billion, the mayor oversees services from policing to education in a city visited by 65 million people a year.The position carries both domestic and global weight, with previous mayors using it as a platform for presidential ambitions.The city also leads in artificial intelligence, hosting over 2,000 AI startups and a skilled workforce of 40,000.","34-year-old Mamdani will be New York City's youngest and first Muslim mayor.

Indian origin Democrat Ghazala Hashmi elected Lt governor







Democrat Abigail Spanberger has become the governor of Virginia, making history as the first woman to lead the state after reclaiming the governor’s mansion from Republicans on Tuesday.The former congresswoman and ex-CIA officer defeated Virginia’s Republican lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, as reported by CBS News.The Virginia race drew national attention, seen by many as a referendum on US President Donald Trump. While Trump made significant gains in the state during the 2020 election, his new term has brought economic strain for many Virginians.Virginia has trended more Democratic in recent years, fueled by growth in Washington, DC’s suburbs. However, Democrats lost some ground last year as Trump increased his statewide vote share from 44 percent in 2020 to 46.1 percent in 2024.Spanberger focused on the economic fallout from Trump’s federal spending cuts, which hurt jobs in Virginia, and campaigned on making life more affordable.In the final weeks, Spanberger campaigned alongside prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, and former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg.Earle-Sears leaned on the backing of outgoing Republican governor Glenn Youngkin, promoting his economic record throughout her campaign.However, the Republican candidate did not receive a direct endorsement from Trump, despite his “complete and total endorsement” of GOP nominees in Virginia’s attorney general race and New Jersey’s gubernatorial contest.Trump expressed some support for Earle-Sears, though he did not mention her by name.Northern Virginia, home to many federal workers, has been hit by workforce cuts and the government shutdown.Virginia was one of two states, along with New Jersey, voting for governor on Tuesday. Voters also chose a new mayor in New York City, while Californians decided on a new congressional map aimed at helping Democrats gain up to five additional US House seats in next year’s midterm elections, as reported by AP.Democrat Ghazala Hashmi won Virginia’s lieutenant governor race on Tuesday, defeating Republican John Reid. She becomes the first Indian American and the first Muslim to hold statewide office in Virginia.Hashmi currently serves as a state senator representing a district south of Richmond. Before entering politics, she was a college professor in Virginia.She began her political career in 2019 by winning a Republican-held state Senate seat and later secured victory in a crowded Democratic primary for lieutenant governor in June, as reported by AP.","Abigail Spanberger defeated Republican Winsome Earle-Sears to become the first woman to lead Virginia.

MAGA Attacks, Racist Slurs: Zohran Mamdani's Battle For NYC In Trump's America

The controversy

Why it matters

The reaction

The bottom line





An internal memo has accused the BBC of breaching impartiality over a Panorama episode that allegedly distorted Donald Trump ’s words from his January 6 speech.The BBC is under fire after a leaked internal memo accused its flagship investigative programme Panorama of misleading viewers by editing Donald Trump’s 2021 Capitol riot speech in a way that changed its meaning. The one-hour episode, titled Trump: A Second Chance?, aired in October 2024—just a week before the US election—and allegedly spliced two separate sections of the former president’s address to make him appear to call for violence.Michael Prescott, a former adviser to the BBC’s Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee, submitted a 19-page dossier to the BBC board alleging “shocking” breaches of impartiality. He said the episode had “completely misled” viewers by merging Trump’s calm call to “peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard” with his later exhortation to “fight like hell”, which referred to contesting the 2020 election results.Prescott claimed that an internal review led by senior adviser David Grossman supported his concerns, but that BBC executives rejected the findings. Jonathan Munro, the BBC’s senior controller of news content, reportedly defended the broadcast, saying it was standard practice to shorten long speeches for context.Prescott countered that the splicing “set a very, very dangerous precedent.”The BBC’s credibility rests on its reputation for balance and accuracy. Allegations that its own editorial staff manipulated footage from one of the most consequential political moments in recent American history threaten to undermine that reputation. The timing—days before a US presidential election—only magnified the fallout.Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., blasted the BBC on social media, accusing British journalists of being “as dishonest as the ones in America.” The broadcaster declined to comment directly on the leak, saying only that it “takes all feedback seriously” and routinely debates differing views on coverage.The memo adds to growing scrutiny of the BBC’s editorial judgement at a time when public trust in media is fraying worldwide. For an organisation built on the promise of impartiality, the question now isn’t just whether Panorama got it wrong—but whether the BBC still knows how to get it right.","An internal memo has accused the BBC of breaching impartiality over a Panorama episode that allegedly distorted Donald Trump ’s words from his January 6 speech.

WATCH: Moment When Indian-Origin Businessman Darshan Singh Sahsi Killed By Bishnoi Gang In Canada





A viral video from Toronto has triggered outrage after it showed an allegedly intoxicated man launching an unprovoked assault on an Indian individual inside an eatery, reigniting concerns over rising xenophobia in Canada.The widely shared clip captures a heated altercation between a man wearing a Toronto Blue Jays jacket and another man, believed to be of Indian origin, near the ‘Mobile Order Pick Up’ counter of the cafe.The footage begins with the Canadian man throwing his phone in anger, prompting the Indian man to pick it up. Moments later, the allegedly intoxicated individual charges towards him, shoving and grabbing him by the collar while accusing him of “acting superior.”. The Indian man is heard responding calmly, warning, “You might get yourself in trouble"".Despite maintaining his composure and refraining from retaliation, the victim is repeatedly pushed and assaulted unprovokedly, held by the collar as the aggressor continues to shout, “What did you just say to me?” A staff member eventually intervenes, urging both men to “take it outside” and saying ""Please leave"". The situation de-escalates only after the aggressor is escorted out of the premises.The incident has sparked widespread condemnation online, with social media users calling for strict action and greater protection for immigrants amid rising cases of racially motivated assaults.This incident comes close on the heels of another violent attack involving an Indian-origin businessman in Edmonton. On October 19, 55-year-old Arvi Singh Sagoo succumbed to injuries after being punched by a man he confronted for urinating on his car. The impact caused Sagoo to fall and lose consciousness; he later died in hospital five days after the assault, according to Global News.The accused, Kyle Papin, was arrested and charged with aggravated assault by the Edmonton Police. Following Sagoo’s death, a fundraiser organised by his friend Vincent Ram aims to support his children and cover funeral expenses.Both incidents have reignited debate over the safety of immigrants and the growing instances of racially charged violence across Canadian cities.","A viral video from Toronto has triggered outrage after it showed an allegedly intoxicated man launching an unprovoked assault on an Indian individual inside an eatery.

MUMBAI: Observing that a lenient view is taken considering the accused is the sole earning member of his family, a special Pocso court on Saturday sentenced a 27-year-old Andheri-based man to three months in simple jail for stalking and sexually harassing of a 17-year-old college student on a suburban local train from Borivli to Vile Parle for more than a year between 2018-19.The maximum sentence for the charge is three years.

The US carried out another strike at an alleged drug vessel in the eastern Pacific, killing two people, as part of a months-long maritime campaign now totalling at least 66 deaths.Defense secretary Pete Hegseth shared a video of the strike on his X. “Today, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War carried out a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO),” wrote Hegseth.The strikes, which began on September 2, have reached 16 strikes that have destroyed at least 17 vessels—16 boats and one semi‑submersible—and killed up to 66 people. Hegseth, sharing the success of the strike, wrote, ""Intelligence confirmed that the vessel was involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics. The strike was conducted in international waters in the Eastern Pacific. "" Though Washington has not publicly provided evidence that the targeted boats posed an imminent threat to the US.The operations coincide with the arrival of an American aircraft carrier to the region, signalling an expansion of US military presence across Caribbean waters amid stepped‑up maritime interdictions.US President Donald Trump has framed the strikes as actions taken during an “armed conflict” with drug cartels, asserting the boats are run by foreign terrorist organisations and vowing to continue targeting them.“We will find and terminate EVERY vessel with the intention of trafficking drugs to America to poison our citizens,” Hegseth wrote, adding, “Protecting the homeland is our TOP priority. NO cartel terrorist stands a chance against the American military,"" the defense secretary wrote further in his post.Experts have described the maritime killings as extrajudicial, warning that the government has not offered a clear legal framework, even if the targets were known traffickers. Lawmakers from both parties have pressed for details and a formal justification.Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, indicted in the US on narcoterrorism charges, has accused Washington of “fabricating a war” against him as the maritime campaign intensifies near his country’s maritime approaches.Trump, when asked on CBS’s “60 Minutes” whether the U.S. was heading to war with Venezuela, said, “I doubt it.

FULL PRESSER: Karoline Leavitt Blames Democrats’ ‘RIDICULOUS Gimmicks’ For Mayhem At US Airports





WASHINGTON: The US government shutdown entered its 35th day on Tuesday, matching a record set during Donald Trump's first presidency, as his administration warned of potential chaos at airports going into one of the busiest travel periods of the year.The federal closure appears almost certain to become the longest in history, with no major breakthroughs expected before it goes into its sixth week at midnight -- although there were fragile signs in Congress that an off-ramp was closer than ever.The government has been grinding to a halt since Congress failed to approve funding past September 30, and pain has been mounting as welfare programs -- including aid that helps millions of Americans afford groceries -- hang in limbo.About 1.4 million federal workers, from air traffic controllers to park wardens, have been placed on enforced leave without pay or made to work for nothing.The Trump administration sounded the alarm Tuesday over turmoil at airports nationwide if the shutdown drags into a sixth week, worsening staff shortages, snarling airport lines and closing down sections of airspace.""So if you bring us to a week from today, Democrats, you will see mass chaos...You will see mass flight delays,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told a news conference in Philadelphia.""You'll see mass cancelations, and you may see us close certain parts of the airspace, because we just cannot manage it because we don't have the air traffic controllers.""Thanksgiving air travel is expected to set a new record this year, the AAA projected -- with 5.8 million people set to fly domestically over the November 27 holiday.More than 60,000 air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers are working without pay, and the White House has warned that increasing absenteeism could mean chaos at check-in lines.Airport workers calling in sick rather than working without pay -- leading to significant delays -- was a major factor in Trump bringing an end to the 2019 shutdown, the joint-longest alongside the current stoppage.Some lawmakers are hoping a slew of elections taking place in New York, Virginia, New Jersey and California on Tuesday will provide the momentum they need to reopen the government.But both sides remain dug in over the main sticking point -- health care spending.- 'Defiance' -Democrats say they will only provide votes to end the funding lapse after a deal has been struck to extend expiring insurance subsidies that make health care affordable for millions of Americans.But Republicans insist they will only address health care once Democrats have voted to switch the lights back on in Washington.While both sides' leadership have shown little appetite for compromise, there have been signs of life on the back benches, with a handful of moderate Democrats working to find an escape hatch.A separate bipartisan group of four centrist House members unveiled a compromise framework Monday for lowering health insurance costs.Democrats believe that millions of Americans seeing skyrocketing premiums as they enroll onto health insurance programs for next year will pressure Republicans into seeking compromise.But Trump has held firm on refusing to negotiate, telling CBS News in an interview broadcast Sunday that he would ""not be extorted.""The president has sought to apply his own pressure to force Democrats to cave, by threatening mass layoffs of federal workers and using the shutdown to target progressive priorities.Last week, his administration threatened to cut off a vital aid program that helps 42 million Americans pay for groceries for the first time in its more than 60-year history, before the move was blocked by two courts.Trump nevertheless insisted Tuesday -- in apparent defiance of the court orders -- that the food aid would be disbursed only after the government shutdown ends.The White House later clarified, however, that it was ""fully complying"" with its legal obligations and was working to get partial SNAP payments ""out the door as much as we can and as quickly as we can.""","The US government shutdown entered its 35th day on Tuesday, matching a record set during Donald Trump's first presidency.

A worker, who had been rescued from the rubble of the collapsed medieval Torre dei Conti in central Rome, died, Italian news outlet Corriere della Sera reported after midnight on Tuesday.Crowds had cheered when emergency services freed him on Monday evening, but crews, who worked through the night amid the risk of further collapses, were unable to save him.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni named the man as Octay Stroici in a statement after midnight, saying ""she shares deep sorrow and condolences, on behalf of myself and the government, for the tragic loss"".""We are close to his family and colleagues at this time of unspeakable suffering,"" she added.Another worker was seriously injured when the Torre dei Conti collapsed twice on Monday during renovation work.Italy’s national fire department spokesman Luca Cari said one worker was in hospital in a critical condition, while three other workers were pulled out unharmed.Hundreds of tourists watched firefighters use a mobile ladder to reach the upper level of the 29-metre (95 ft) tower, where the man had been trapped by the first collapse sometime before noon.During the rescue attempt, another part of the structure collapsed, sending a cloud of debris over the area and forcing firefighters to retreat. Large clouds of dust filled the square, accompanied by the sound of falling masonry.The tower remained standing but suffered significant internal damage.Gelato shop worker Queen Paglinawan, 27, said she heard two loud noises in quick succession. She said: ""I was working and then I heard some like falling, and then I saw the tower collapse in a diagonal way.""German student Viktoria Braeu, 18, said: ""We were just at the Colosseum … and we were just walking to get some food. ... And then we were like, 'It's probably not long until it's going to go down,' and then it just started erupting.'""No firefighters were injured. A drone was flown up to check the condition of the trapped worker.Rome city authorities said the Torre dei Conti, also known as the Tower of the Counts, has not been used since 2006 and was undergoing a four-year renovation project due to end next year.The surrounding area on Via dei Fori Imperiali had been closed off to pedestrians during the work.

Trump claims his test results were 'perfect'









White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt found herself under pressure on Tuesday when reporters repeatedly asked why President Donald Trump had undergone an MRI during a recent visit to Walter Reed Military Medical Center last week.Leavitt offered little clarity, saying only that she would “check back,” while insisting the president remained in “optimal physical health.”The questions came after the 79-year-old MAGA chief revealed last week that he had undergone both an MRI and a cognitive test during a visit to the military hospital. The disclosure came just six months after his annual physical in April.During the briefing, CNN’s Kristen Holmes asked, “Why did President Trump get an MRI during his recent visit to Walter Reed?” Leavitt responded that the visit had been a “follow-up appointment” and repeated that the president was in “optimal physical health.”When Holmes pressed further, noting that an MRI is ""a very specific procedure"" and not typically part of a routine exam, Leavitt repeated, “I’ll check back for you,” before moving on to another question.Trump first mentioned the scan himself while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Japan. “We had an MRI, MRI and the machine, you know, the whole thing, and it was perfect,” he said, later directing reporters to ask his doctors for details.Concerns over the president’s health have lingered for months. Photos showing bruises on his hands and swelling in his ankles have raised questions about his condition. The White House attributed the bruising to frequent handshakes and Trump’s routine aspirin use, and said the swelling was caused by chronic venous insufficiency, a common ailment in older adults.

‘JUST IGNORE HIM!’: Zohran Mamdani ‘HUMILIATES’ Trump As He Casts Ballot In NYC Mayoral Election

Mamdani’s record and the Israel debate





In a sharp escalation ahead of New York’s mayoral election, US President Donald Trump called Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani a “self-professed Jew hater,” adding that “any Jewish person who votes for him is stupid.” The remarks, posted on Trump’s Truth Social account just as voting began, have injected fresh controversy into a closely watched race already marked by tensions over religion, identity, and foreign policy views.Trump’s post came as New Yorkers cast ballots in an election that could make Mamdani — a 34-year-old Muslim lawmaker and democratic socialist — the city’s first Muslim mayor. The city is home to the country’s largest Jewish and Muslim communities, adding further significance to the contest.The president has repeatedly criticised Mamdani over recent months, calling him “a communist” and “a total nutjob,” while questioning his views on Israel and national security. On the eve of the election, Trump took the unusual step of endorsing independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, the former Democratic governor, instead of Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa — a decision that underscored his desire to prevent a Mamdani victory.In his Truth Social post, Trump accused Mamdani of “hating Israel” and said Jewish voters who support him were “betraying their own community.”Mamdani, who represents Queens in the New York State Assembly, has faced criticism for his views on Israel and Palestine. He has argued that Israel should not exist as a specifically Jewish state and has spoken in support of Palestinian rights. He was also criticised for not initially condemning the slogan “globalise the intifada,” though he later said he would discourage its use.","US President Donald Trump called Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani a “self- professed Jew hater,’ adding that “any Jewish person who votes for him is stupid” The remarks, posted on Trump’s Truth Social account just as voting began, have injected fresh controversy into a closely watched race.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125095981,imgsize-82758,width-400,resizemode-4/39any-jew-who-votes-for39-donald-trump-attacks-zohran-mamdani-ahead-of-nyc-polls.jpg"

Former New York City mayor Bill de Blasio has openly backed mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani , casting his vote while wearing a “Hot Girls for Zohran” T-shirt.De Blasio shared a smiling photo of himself at the polling station and posted on X: “One of the happiest votes I ever cast! What a beautiful day for NYC!”Meanwhile, Donald Trump made a scathing remark about New York’s future leadership in his recent CBS' 60 Minutes interview, criticising the possibility of Mamdani leading the city. The president warned that New York could risk losing federal support, noting that the city currently receives $7.4 billion in federal funding.Trump dismissed Mamdani as a “communist,” saying, “If you have a communist running New York, all you’re doing is wasting the money you’re sending there.” The remarks have fuelled speculation about whether Trump’s administration would actually move to restrict funding and send National Guard in the Blue region, like he did previously with other Democratic strongholdsBill de Blasio was the 109th mayor of New York City, serving from 2014 to 2021 as a Democrat. He built his image around progressive causes, pushing for affordable housing, early childhood education, and police reform. Before his time as mayor, he worked as a political organiser and later as the city’s public advocate. Though his tenure ended with criticism over public safety and his handling of the pandemic, de Blasio remains active in local politics. His recent support for Zohran Mamdani shows that he still identifies with New York’s progressive movement and its shifting political base.The campaign slogan “Hot Girls for Zohran” has become a viral grassroots movement supporting Zohran Mamdani, the progressive New York mayoral candidate. What began as a cheeky slogan on T-shirts and social media has turned into a creative force for mobilisation, blending humour with activism. The phrase redefines “hot” to mean politically aware and socially engaged, resonating strongly with younger voters. The group behind it has helped organise events and sell merchandise at campaign pop-ups, turning a playful idea into a statement of identity.","Bill de Blasio was the 109th mayor of New York City, serving from 2014 to 2021 as a Democrat.

'Beg You, Please Show Up': Republicans' Huge Shutdown SURRENDER To Dems? Mike Johnson & Co Say...





US transport secretary Sean Duffy on Tuesday warned that if the government shutdown continues for another week, it will disrupt air travel by worsening staff shortages, causing long queues at airports and forcing the closure of parts of US airspace.""So if you bring us to a week from today, Democrats, you will see mass chaos... You will see mass flight delays,"" he said at a news conference in Philadelphia, as quoted by news agency AFP.“You'll see mass cancellations, and you may see us close certain parts of the airspace, because we just cannot manage it because we don't have the air traffic controllers.”With US Congress still deadlocked over health care funding, the shutdown is on track to become the longest in US history. Public services continue to be affected as Trump’s Republicans and Democrats remain unable to reach an agreement.More than 60,000 air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) staff are currently working without pay. The White House has warned that rising absenteeism among staff could lead to delays at airport security checkpoints.During the 2019 shutdown, one of the two longest shutdowns at 35 days, similar staff shortages and sick calls from airport workers were a key factor in ending the standoff.In the latest effort to reopen the government, a House-approved resolution failed again in the Senate on Tuesday, marking the 14th rejection.Democrats say reopening the government requires negotiation led by Trump on their demand to extend subsidies that help millions of Americans afford health insurance. Trump has said he will not negotiate with Democrats until the shutdown ends.","US transport secretary Sean Duffy warned that if the government shutdown continues for another week, it will disrupt air travel.

"Is MAGA trying to replace Charlie Kirk? Candace Owens makes wild claim, says ‘GOP hosting public auditions’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-maga-trying-to-replace-charlie-kirk-candace-owens-makes-wild-claim-says-gop-hosting-public-auditions/articleshow/125093765.cms,"'They All Betrayed...': Candace Owens Sparks Panic With Late-Night Tweet On Charlie Kirk Case

Did Israel kill Charlie Kirk? Owens weighs in



Conspiracy theories







Conservative commentator Candace Owens has accused Donald Trump ’s team of showing little to no interest in the investigation into Charlie Kirk ’s death, while doubling down on her claim that Israel was involved in the conservative leader’s assassination, according to the Independent.Owens is a long-time ally of the late Turning Point USA founder, who was assassinated by a sniper bullet in September. She has repeatedly pushed the theory since Kirk’s death.In a post on X, Owens claimed that the MAGA administration is “hosting public auditions” to fill Kirk’s place and that the public can see it happening.On her podcast this week, she took aim at Trump and the Republican establishment. “I know spiritually, from the moment Charlie Kirk passed, that we were never going to get the full story from officials,” she said, adding that the Trump administration’s silence was due to the “pro-Israel lobby.”Owens slammed Trump for posting an “AI-generated photo” of himself with Kirk and the Star of David in the background, claiming it was proof the investigation had stalled.“Find me just one person with a platform who is pro-Israel who says ‘I want the investigation into [Kirk’s] death to continue,’” she said. “It’s a bit weird right? Dog’s very silent right now and there’s steak on the ground and they’re not moving.”The influencer also condemned Trump’s move to declare a national day of remembrance for Kirk, arguing it was an attempt to close the case.“I think it’s crap. It’s never good when the feds are lining up to give you a holiday. Martin Luther King, Jr. vibes. I definitely think the feds killed Martin Luther King Jr … I don’t like it. The best way to honour Charlie Kirk is to figure out who killed him.”Owens has previously faced accusations of antisemitism, particularly after she was suspended from YouTube in 2023 for re-uploading a 2022 interview with Kanye West in which he claimed “Jewish people control the media.”Her latest comments resulted in the birth of more conspiracy theories surrounding Kirk’s death, with Owens and fellow conservative Tucker Carlson suggesting Israel suppressed information about the case. They argue that Kirk, before his death, had begun to question Israel’s influence over US politics.Owens further alleged that Kirk told her he had been threatened by Israeli officials and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. Both Ackman and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have denied her claims.","Owens is a long-time ally of the late Turning Point USA founder, who was assassinated by a sniper bullet in September.

‘Growing anti-Hindu sentiment’: Indian-origin Congressman slams JD Vance over remarks about wife Usha’s faith,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/growing-anti-hindu-sentiment-indian-origin-congressman-slams-jd-vance-over-remarks-about-wife-ushas-faith/articleshow/125091769.cms,"JD Vance's Hindu Wife Usha To Convert After Vice President's Pitch? US Expert’s Big Reveal





US Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi slammed vice president JD Vance for his recent comments about his wife’s Hindu background, saying they contribute to a growing atmosphere of prejudice and anti-Hindu sentiment in the United States.“At a time when Hindu and Indian-American communities are confronting a climate of rising prejudice, talk of mass deportations, and growing anti-Hindu sentiment even against members of his own party, it's deeply disappointing that the Vice President would add to that climate through his recent comments while remaining silent in the face of hate,” Krishnamoorthi said on X.Vance, who is married to Indian-American Usha Vance, made some controversial remarks during a public event at the University of Mississippi. Vance said he hoped Usha turned to Christianity and claimed that her Hindu background stems from ""not a particularly religious family.""Responding to a question about his interfaith marriage, he said, “Now, most Sundays, Usha will come with me to church. As I've told her, and as I've said publicly, and as I'll say now in front of 10,000 of my closest friends, do I hope, eventually, that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved by in church? Yeah, I honestly do wish that because I believe in the Christian gospel and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way.He added, “But if she doesn't, then God says everybody has free will, and so that doesn't cause a problem for me. That's something you work out with your friends, with your family, with the person that you love.”Vance converted to Catholicism in 2019, describing Usha’s background, saying, “My wife did not grow up Christian. I think it's fair to say that she grew up in a Hindu family, but not a particularly religious family in either direction.”His comments stirred a row. Canadian journalist Ezra Levant called them “disgusting” and accused Vance of disrespecting his wife’s faith. “It's weird to throw your wife's religion under the bus, in public, for a moment's acceptance by groypers,” Levant wrote on X.Vance fired back, saying critics were twisting his words and that he loves his wife with all his heart. “My wife is the most amazing blessing I have in my life,” he wrote. “She is not a Christian and has no plans to convert... I hope she may one day see things as I do. Regardless, I'll continue to love and support her.”","US Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi slammed vice president JD Vance for his recent comments about his wife’s Hindu background.
