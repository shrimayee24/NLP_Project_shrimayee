‘Mouths shut when Hindus are killed’: Yogi targets opposition in Assembly

All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) national president Asaduddin Owaisi on has criticised the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh, during a press conference held in Amravati.He referred to recent reports that claimed people's identities were being determined through mobile phones. Owaisi said that the UP government should be ""congratulated"" for the new ""invention"" to determine whether a person is Bangladeshi by placing a mobile phone on their back.Owaisi sarcastically said that even leading scientists and ISRO would be surprised by this ""technology.""He questioned whether citizenship and identity in India would now be determined by mobile phones. He said that such actions were not only ridiculous but also against both the law and the Constitution.Furthermore, Owaisi claimed that after a mosque, the administration has now taken bulldozer action against madrasas, which are being termed illegal, in Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal district. He alleged that the government is acting arbitrarily in the name of bulldozer action and misusing the law.He alleged that the government is targeting a particular community and using the bulldozer as a political weapon.However, the administration says that the action is being taken only against illegal constructions and there is no discrimination against any community.The AIMIM chief alleged that such manoeuvres are creating an atmosphere of fear among the public and arbitrariness in the name of law and order. He demanded that the government adhere to constitutional and legal procedures on serious issues like identity and citizenship.He levelled serious allegations against the Modi government and the ruling parties regarding electoral politics. He stated that first, there was the issue of vote theft, and now candidates are being ""stolen.""He alleged that in many places, candidates are being forced to withdraw their nominations through intimidation, threats, or bribery, which is a very dangerous trend for democracy.Owaisi said that if voters are not provided with a candidate of their choice, the very foundation of democracy will be weakened. He also said that this process directly violates the public's right to vote, reducing elections to a mere formality.On the BMC elections, Owaisi said, ""If elections are being held unopposed anywhere through intimidation, threats, or bribery, then it is a threat to our democracy.""Owaisi appealed to political parties to keep constitutional obligations and social harmony in mind when making statements on issues like elections and population.Owaisi raised several serious questions about the central government's foreign policy and security strategy. He said that after the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, India took a tough stance and tightened its water-related agreements against Pakistan, but despite this, there was no hesitation in playing against Pakistan in international cricket tournaments.Calling this a ""double standard,"" Owaisi asked why normal relations are being pursued on the playing field while issuing strong statements on terrorism.Speaking on the Bangladesh issue, Owaisi said that a clear and transparent policy should be formulated regarding illegal Bangladeshi nationals living in India. Those living illegally should be deported through legal procedures, but the entire process should be in accordance with the Constitution and human values. He said that political stability in Bangladesh is crucial for the security and development of India, especially the northeastern states.Owaisi also said that increased strategic activities by China near the Bangladesh border and the presence of elements linked to Pakistan's intelligence agency are matters of concern. He stressed that these issues should be viewed not merely from a political perspective but in the broader context of national security.",All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) national president Asaduddin Owaisi on has criticised the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh.

KOLKATA: Sunday marked two months of the SIR rollout in Bengal as people struggle to get back something as basic as their voting right amid confusion among officials over which documents are kosher, multiple orders from Election Commission, flip-flops, and innumerable goof-ups.The chaotic drive led CM Mamata Banerjee to write on Saturday to chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar to either ""rectify glitches"" or halt the ""unplanned, arbitrary and ad-hoc"" SIR of electoral rolls.Banerjee asked the CEC why Bengal was being ""singled out"" for ""arbitrary and illegal"" voter deletions. This was her fourth letter to Kumar since SIR began.Jayanti Devi (80) was one face of the confusion. Laden with a bag of medicines and documents, she stood clueless outside an SIR hearing camp at Chetla Boys' High School in Kolkata Sunday. She was asked to come for a second hearing with an old ration card or her parents' documents. ""I cannot hear or see properly. I can hardly walk... I don't have many documents, but I have a voter card. I have always cast my vote. Now they are saying there is a problem,"" she said.Jayanti's son said they had not been told of the EC order that voters aged 85 or more, as well as those who are sick or disabled, will not be called to such hearings.""They (EC officials) did come, but only to inform us about the hearing date. My parents moved to Chetla in 1967. She has been voting here since,"" he said.At Kalighat High School, Sister John Paul of the Missionaries of Charity had to appear for a hearing for putting Sister Nirmala in the column for her ""parent's name"" - the standard practice among all such orders and one acknowledged by EC.A Goan, Sister Paul came to Bengal in 2002 - the reference year for SIR in Bengal. In 2006, she had her voter and Aadhaar cards made and Sister Nirmala, then superior general of missionaries of charity, was named her guardian in the documents. ""I did not have my birth certificate with me. My sister sent it to me. It's absolute chaos,"" the 46-year-old said. Around 10 nuns of the order have received hearing notices.Roma Samanta, a voter in Kolkata's Rashbehari, got a hearing notice as her name was mixed up with a namesake from Kaliaganj in North Dinajpur district, over 400km away. ""We have been living here for 30 years... Our BLO told us to write a letter to the CEO. We have come to submit that,"" Samanta's husband said.In her letter to the CEC, the CM highlighted some of these hassles. ""Family register, extensively accepted as valid proof of identity during the SIR exercise in Bihar, is now reportedly being denied... such selective and unexplained exclusion of a previously accepted document raises serious concerns of discrimination and arbitrariness,"" Banerjee wrote.The CM claimed residence/domicile certificates issued by state authorities were also being rejected. Calling EC insensitive, CM said even the ""elderly, infirm, and seriously ill citizens are not being spared"". ""Many electors are being compelled to travel 20-25km to attend hearings, which have inexplicably been centralised rather than decentralised,"" she wrote.Amid the outcry, the poll panel announced 160 more SIR hearing centres, mostly in north Bengal. The new centres will be set up keeping in mind geographical constraints and distance for voters, EC officials said.","Sunday marked two months of the SIR rollout in Bengal.

'Lunatic Rulers’: Shashi Tharoor, Singhvi, Owaisi, Other Indian Leaders On US Strikes In Venezuela

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Sunday weighed-in on the US strikes on Venezuela, a day before, calling it ""law of the jungle"".The US carried out multiple airstrikes on Venezuela early Saturday, triggering explosions across Caracas and paving the way for the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. The dramatic escalation was confirmed hours later by US President Donald Trump. Venezuelan authorities declared a state of emergency as panic swept the capital following the attacks, which left at least 40 people dead.Talking about the situation, the chair of the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs, replied to a post by Indian author Kapil Komireddi, saying ""International law and the UN Charter have for some years now been honoured in the breach. The Law of the Jungle prevails today. “Might is Right” is the new creed.""Congress general secretary in charge of Communications Jairam Ramesh also gave a statement on behalf of Congress saying, ""The INC expresses very grave concern on US actions relating to Venezuela in the past 24 hours. Settled principles of international law cannot be violated unilaterally.""Meanwhile, Congress leader and Member of Rajya Sabha Abhishek Manu Singhvi called it ""19th-cen imperialism"".""Regime change by cruise missile, democracy delivered by warship, & sovereignty rewritten under self-styled Doctrine? Not leadership, this is 19th-cen imperialism in 21st-cen jargon. If international law matters only to weak, UN should shut shop. world deserves rules, not lunatic rulers,"" he said on X.AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi said that US set an example that India should follow. """"Today we heard that US President Donald Trump's forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and took him from his country to America. If US President Donald Trump can abduct Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from his own country, then you (Prime Minister Modi) can also go to Pakistan and bring back the mastermind of the 26/11 terrorist attacks to India,"" he said.In response to Owaisi, BJP MP Gulam Ali Khatana said, talking to ANI, ""The entire country has praised the Indian armed forces. The way terrorists were eliminated and neutralised under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, only Prime Minister Modi's government could have done this. Were we supposed to bring them here and feed them?""Shiv Sena leader Shaina NC also hit back at the AIMIM leader saying, """"Asaduddin Owaisi, don't you worry. Under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, India has become the world's fourth-largest economy. We have demonstrated unparalleled strength through Operation Sindoor, we have launched missiles, we have eradicated terrorism from Pakistan... we have even secured the extradition of Tahawwur Rana... Unlike you, we do not engage in appeasement politics. .. You continue with your politics of appeasement, and we will continue doing our work.""Shaina NC also spoke about the escalating situation in Venezuela itself. ""India has always maintained cordial relations with Venezuela, with strong diplomatic engagements over the years. This is a matter of grave concern, as ties with Latin America and South America have been carefully nurtured,"" she said, while talking to PTI.Further referring to the MEA statement on the crisis she added, ""The Ministry of External Affairs has advised that the safety of Indian nationals living there should be prioritised. No country can go around bullying the world; the situation must be viewed holistically. The global community today is worried about such actions, surgical strikes, and, above all, the safety of citizens, which must be seen from a collective global perspective. ”The ministry of external affairs, in its official statement, reiterated India’s support for the safety of people in Venezuela.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday wrote to Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar, criticising the ""procedural violations"" and ""administrative lapses"" in the Special Intensive Revision (SIR), which is currently under way in the poll-bound state.Mamata Banerjee called the exercise ""unplanned, arbitrary and adhoc"" and urged the poll body chief to stop the SIR if glitches remain unattainted.""I am once again constrained to write to you in order to place on record my grave concern regarding the serious irregularities, procedural violations, and administrative lapses being witnessed during the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the electoral rolls in West Bengal,"" she wrote in a letter.She also expressed apprehension about the large-scale disenfranchisement of eligible voters, which she said would be a ""direct assault on the foundational principles of democratic governance"".""I strongly urge you to immediately address and rectify the glitches, address the flaws and make the necessary corrections, failing which this unplanned, arbitrary and adhoc exercise must be halted. If allowed to continúe in its present form, it will result in irreparable damage, large-scale disenfranchisement of eligible voters, and a direct assault on the foundational principles of democratic governance, "" she further wrote.In November last year, describing the ongoing SIR in West Bengal as “unplanned, chaotic, and dangerous,” Mamata Banerjee said that the situation had reached an “alarming stage” following the deaths of multiple booth-level officers (BLOs), including an anganwadi worker in Jalpaiguri.In a letter addressed to Gyanesh Kumar, Banerjee said she had “time and again flagged my serious concerns” but had now been “compelled to write” as the situation had deteriorated sharply.She wrote that the manner in which the EC had pushed the SIR onto officials and residents was “not only unplanned and chaotic, but also dangerous”, alleging the absence of basic preparedness, clear communication, or adequate planning.According to her, the process has been “crippled from day one” by poor training, confusion over mandatory documentation, and the near impossibility of meeting voters during their work hours.She warned that the credibility of the voter roll itself was at risk, saying BLOs were being forced to work “far beyond human limits” while balancing their principal duties as teachers and frontline workers.Banerjee said most BLOs were struggling with online submissions because of server failures and repeated data mismatches, making it “almost certain” that accurate voter data could not be uploaded by the 4 December deadline. She added that many BLOs, under fear of punitive action, were being pushed to submit incorrect entries, “risking disenfranchisement of genuine voters”.","Mamata Banerjee criticises ""procedural violations"" and ""administrative lapses"" in the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) in West Bengal.

Rodriguez, 56, is a senior figure in Venezuela’s socialist leadership and a close ally of Maduro.

AMRITSAR: An Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) sarpanch was shot dead in full public view in Punjab's Amritsar on Sunday after assailants stormed a wedding venue, opening fire in front of horrified guests.Jarmal Singh, the sarpanch of Valtoha village in Tarn Taran district, was attending a ceremony at the Marigold Marriage Palace when the attack occurred. According to officials, two unidentified gunmen entered the resort between 2:30 pm and 3 pm, targeting Singh and shooting him at point-blank range in the head.Police sources said the gunmen struck just moments after the bride and groom had departed the venue. Despite the presence of numerous wedding guests, the attackers made no attempt to conceal their identities.""The assailants arrived with premeditated intent,"" a police spokesperson said. ""Eyewitness accounts suggest the attackers did not cover their faces, and we suspect the victim was under heavy surveillance prior to the incident,"" he added.Singh was rushed to a nearby hospital after a video surfaced showing him lying injured at the scene.

'They Won't Survive': GOP Lawmakers Reveal 2 New Trump Targets After Maduro Operation





US President Donald Trump on Sunday openly threatened possible military action against Colombia, saying such a move “sounds good to me”.His comments come just a day after the United States carried out an operation in Venezuela, capturing President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores and transporting them to New York to face federal charges.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump launched a sharp attack on Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro, accusing his government of producing and exporting cocaine to the United States.“Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man, who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he’s not going to be doing it very long,” Trump said.Also Read | 'If they don't behave': Is second strike on Venezuela off the table? Trump's fresh warning When asked directly whether the United States would carry out a military operation against Colombia, the president replied, “It sounds good to me.”According to an audio recording of the interaction with reporters, Trump’s remarks were made during a conversation about US efforts to counter drug trafficking in the region.Maduro and Flores were removed from Caracas by US forces, flown aboard the USS Iwo Jima in the Caribbean and later taken to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. They face charges in the Southern District of New York, including conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism, cocaine importation and possession of machine guns and destructive devices.Trump’s latest remarks on Colombia follow months of rising tensions between Washington and Bogotá, amid a US military build-up in the Caribbean and the administration’s increasingly aggressive posture toward Latin American governments accused of enabling drug trafficking, according to Reuters.Last month, Trump issued a sharp warning to Petro from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, accusing Colombia of allowing cocaine production and exports to the US. “He has to watch because he’s got drug factories. He’s no friend to the United States,” Trump said at the time.In another statement, Trump said, “We love the Colombian people, but their new leader is a troublemaker, and he better watch it.” Claiming that Colombia has at least three major cocaine manufacturing facilities, he added, “We know where they are. He better close them up fast.”The warnings marked an escalation in a months-long feud between the two leaders, with Trump repeatedly suggesting that countries sending illegal drugs into the US could face military strikes. During a cabinet meeting earlier this month, he said, “Anybody that’s doing that and selling it into our country is subject to attack.”Colombia has historically been one of Washington’s closest allies in Latin America, but relations have deteriorated since Petro, the country’s first leftist president, took office in 2022.Petro has strongly rejected Trump’s accusations, saying that his government has been seizing cocaine at unprecedented rates and destroying drug-production laboratories without foreign military intervention. Last month, he even invited Trump to visit Colombia, the world’s largest producer of cocaine, to see the government’s efforts firsthand.“Come to Colombia, Mr. Trump… but do not threaten our sovereignty, because you will awaken the Jaguar,” Petro wrote in a post on X. He warned that any attack on Colombia would amount to a declaration of war and accused the US of violating international norms.Petro also condemned the US operation in Venezuela, calling it an “assault on the sovereignty” of Latin America that could lead to a humanitarian crisis.","US President Donald Trump openly threatened possible military action against Colombia.

Howard County police are searching for 26-year-old Arjun Sharma after he allegedly killed his ex-girlfriend and fled US for India. Police say Sharma is wanted on first and second-degree murder charges in connection with the death of 27-year-old Nikitha Godishala of Ellicott City.According to police, Sharma reported on New Year’s Eve that he last saw Godishala at his apartment in Columbia and on January 2, he filed a missing persons complaint. Authorities later discovered he had left the country on a flight to India. A search was conducted in his apartment which revealed Godishala’s body. It had multiple stab wounds and other physical trauma.Detectives believe she was killed shortly after 7 pm on December 31, according to CBS News.""There was obviously some premeditation to be able to do this and then to flee the country, so that's what we have right now as far as charges,"" Howard County police spokesman Seth Hoffman told WJZ Investigator Mike Hellgren.Police are unsure whether the murder weapon has been recovered. Hoffman added, ""We are unaware of any previous calls for service or incidents involving the two of them. We do believe it wasn't uncommon that they would still meet each other and have communication after their relationship ended, but we don't have a motive right now as to why he would kill her.""Godishala’s friends said they got concerned when she stopped contacting them on New Year’s Eve. Some posted on social media asking about her whereabouts.Howard County Police are working with federal and international authorities to capture Sharma. ""The US Attorney's office works with Interpol, which is an international organization, and they will eventually issue what is known as a 'red notice'—basically an international arrest warrant,"" Hoffman said.They explained the 'red-notice' that would help in Sharma's arrest: ""From there, that goes out to all the countries that work with Interpol, which is close to 200 countries including India, so that will give Indian authorities information. They will begin to track him and hopefully arrest him. From there, it could take quite a bit of time to process and hopefully get him extradited.""India’s embassy released a statement on X acknowledging the crime: ""The Embassy is in contact with the family of Ms. Nikitha Godishala and is extending all possible consular assistance. The Embassy is also following up the matter with the local authorities.""","Arjun Sharma, 26, is wanted on first and second-degree murder charges in connection with the death of 27-year-old Nikitha Godishala of Ellicott City.

National security advisers from Europe and other allied countries visited Kyiv on Saturday to discuss security guarantees and economic support as part of a US-led push for peace.President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said work on peace proposals could now move faster after Ukraine shared key documents with 18 national security advisers, including those related to security guarantees.He said representatives from Ukraine’s General Staff and military sector were due to meet on Monday in Paris, followed by talks among European leaders on Tuesday.Zelenskyy, who is preparing to travel to Paris, said he hoped documents on security guarantees would be finalised during the meetings. He added that the discussions with US representatives were also expected.","One person was killed in the capital Kyiv, according to Tymur Tkachenko, head of the city’s military administration.

When Elon Musk called his father 'Evil'



Past controversies around Errol Musk







Errol Musk, the father of Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reignited a controversy with the latest comments about the projected demographic transformation in the United States. Speaking in a recent interview, Errol Musk warned that America would ‘collapse’ if the white population becomes a minority within the next two decades, calling the shift “a very, very bad thing to happen. ”Musk raised questions about the implications of the demographic change, asking, “You want to see the U.S. go down? Why? You don’t like electric cars, and you don’t like technology? What is it, you want to go back to the jungle?” Along with this, he also spoke about South Africa, claiming that the “small white population that projects the European culture” has contributed significantly to the growth and development of the Black African population. He dismissed the notion of systemic oppression in South Africa as “nonsense.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk has not shared an amicable relationship with his father. In an interview with Rolling Stone a few years ago, Elon Musk characterised his father as someone who “will plan evil”.Elon Musk has frequently expressed his disapproval of his father, who had ties to the apartheid regime of South Africa and has faced multiple criminal accusations.Musk described Errol as “such a terrible human being” and claimed that his father had committed “almost every crime you can possibly think of.” He added, “My dad will have a carefully thought-out plan of evil. He will plan evil. Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done. It’s so terrible, you can’t believe it.”In 1998, Errol Musk admitted that he killed three people insisting that it was an act of self-defence. Initially he was arrested but was later released after the charges were dropped. The incident was dded to the long list of controversies surrounding him which further fulled Elon Musk’s distrust.Elon Musk has repeatedly emphasised that his father’s words cannot be trusted. Reflecting on his attempts to mend their relationship, Musk said, “In my experience, there is nothing you can do. Nothing, nothing. I wish. I’ve tried everything. I tried threats, rewards, intellectual arguments, emotional arguments, everything to try to change my father for the better, and he, no way, it just got worse.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk had a started relationship with his father Errol. The their relationship has long been a topic of public interest. The controversial statements made by Errol in the past still continue to cast a shadow over their family dynamics offering insight into the personal challenges faced by one of the world’s most influential tech entrepreneurs.","Errol Musk, the father of Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reignited a controversy with the latest comments about the projected demographic transformation in the United States.

MUMBAI: The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) had ordered an inquiry into the claims made by AjayVision Education Pvt. Ltd. on its website www.visionias.in. The institute had advertised its courses by selectively publishing on its website photos and names of certain successful candidates.The Authority observed that Clause 4 of the Guidelines for Prevention of Misleading Advertisements and Endorsements for Misleading Advertisements, 2022, mandated that an advertisement must be truthful and should not mislead consumers with unsubstantiated claims. These claims would have to be objectively verifiable and substantiated before the CCPA if questioned.The CCPA sought details about the details of the enrolment of the students, the courses attended along with the duration, date of joining, and fees receipts issued, and consent for using the student’s name and photo for promotional campaigns.The institute was also called upon to explain why complete details were not posted on the website. The institute responded that limited information was given as the webpage has creative size limitations and would not allow details of every student who scored a rank in the Civil Service Examination.The response was not considered satisfactory as information in respect of certain candidates was deliberately withheld while the claims remained unsubstantiated.So the CCPA ordered a detailed investigation by its Director General.The investigation revealed various anomalies, and some of the students listed as its toppers were not even enrolled with it. The institute stated that in respect of its previous advertisements the CCPA had ruled against it, and the matter was pending in appeal before the National Commission, so the CCPA should not adjudicate upon the fresh advertisements.The CCPA observed that the institute had failed to prove the correctness of its claims, but had brazenly continued with the misleading advertisement and promotional campaign. It ordered the institute to desist from publishing misleading advertisements and imposed a penalty of Rs.11 lakhs for continuing to mislead consumers.",The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) had ordered an inquiry into the claims made by AjayVision Education Pvt.

BAREILLY: A key eyewitness in the September 26 Bareilly violence case has alleged that a plot has been hatched to kill him by offering a Rs 5 lakh contract in an attempt to derail the trial.On his complaint, police lodged an FIR against nine people, including jailed corporator and IMC office-bearer Anees Saklani, his wife Yasmeen Jahan and their son Adnan.The complainant, Mohd Firdaus Khan (35), told police that he assisted authorities during the clashes over ‘I Love Muhammad’ posters and later helped identify several accused using video clips and photographs. He said that due to this reason, the accused got angered with him.Police said Furqan, a resident of Pilibhit district, was arrested on Sunday for allegedly agreeing to carry out the killing. A country-made pistol, cartridges and Rs 20,000, suspected to be part of the advance payment, were recovered from him.SSP Bareilly Anurag Arya said we're verifying the claims and doing thorough investigations. The accused is being questioned.According to the FIR, Firdaus alleged that Saklani and his associates believed he had testified against them and held him responsible for their continued incarceration.Firdaus alleged that on December 18, Adnan and others intercepted and threatened him, accusing him of ensuring their leaders remained in jail. He claimed they (accused) demanded Rs 10 lakh, citing mounting legal expenses, and warned him of consequences if the demand was not met.He further stated that on December 26 he received information that Yasmeen Jahan met Saklani and two other accused inside jail, where a plan to kill him was allegedly finalised. Following this, Furqan was allegedly contacted and tasked with monitoring Firdaus’s movements.Police said Furqan has multiple criminal cases against him and told investigators he first met Saklani while both were lodged in Pilibhit jail in 2022. After his release, he shifted to Bareilly, where he ran a tea stall. He claimed Yasmeen later approached him and gave him cash and a firearm.On Sept 26, violence broke out after police prevented supporters from the minority community from assembling with ‘I Love Muhammad’ placards following Friday prayers. The situation escalated into alleged stone-pelting and firing, leaving at least 10 cops injured. IMC president Maulana Tauqeer Raza Khan is among those arrested, and several charge sheets have been filed in the case.","Mohd Firdaus Khan (35) told police that he assisted authorities during the clashes over ‘I Love Muhammad’ posters.

YouTuber Sneako stirred a row after making a provocative post about US foreign interventions, saying that if any other country attacked a foreign nation hastily, it would be called terrorism—but for America, it is considered colonialism.“If a brown country invaded America to bomb DC and kidnap the president for the sole purpose of stealing our oil, we would rightfully call them terrorists. When Americans do it it’s called colonialism,” Sneako said, referring to the US invasion of Venezuela and capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores.Last week, the United States conducted a massive military strike in the Latin American country, launching what President Donald Trump described as a “large‑scale military operation” that included airstrikes in and around Caracas. Maduro and his wife were captured and flown to the United States to face federal charges.Trump announced the operation the opeartion on social media and dubbed it Operation Absolute Resolve. Maduro is set to appear in a Manhattan federal court on charges including narco‑terrorism and drug trafficking.The MAGA circles appreciated the Trump administration's move to invade Venezuela, but Democratic lawmakers cited that the GOP government took steps without congressional approval and called the strikes unconstitutional.Moreover, right-wing influencer Matt Welsh dismissed Sneako's remarks that the US does whatever it wants. Welsh said ""No Brown country"" is capable of attacking Washington.

US President Donald Trump late Sunday issued another stern warning to Venezuela, saying the US would launch another strike “if they don’t behave.” Invoking the Monroe Doctrine, he defended America’s recent Operation Absolute Resolve and the strikes on Venezuela that led to the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, who were taken into US custody.The strong US military action in Venezuela resulted in the capture of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, on Saturday, just hours after a dramatic operation unfolded in the capital city of Caracas.Speaking about the strikes in Venezuela and invoking the Monroe Doctrine, Trump said, “It’s about peace on Earth. We’ve got to have peace. It’s our hemisphere. The Monroe Doctrine was very important when it was done, and other Presidents, a lot of them, lost sight of it. I didn’t…”He added, ""I knew the possible danger, it was a very dangerous operation.

"H-1B row: One in three immigrants cancel travel over fear of ICE monitoring, survey finds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/h-1b-row-one-in-three-immigrants-cancel-travel-over-fear-of-ice-monitoring-survey-finds/articleshow/126342489.cms,"U.S. Rewrites H-1B Rules, Setback To Indian Workers; Check Who Is Eligible & Changes | WATCH





A nationwide survey shows that fear of immigration enforcement is affecting the daily lives of immigrants across the US, with travel emerging as a major concern.About 27 per cent of immigrants said they had avoided trips within the country or overseas to reduce the risk of encounters with immigration authorities.The survey was conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in partnership with The New York Times in 2025 (August to October). It found that nearly three in ten immigrants altered or cancelled travel plans specifically to avoid drawing attention from immigration authorities. The fear is not limited to undocumented migrants. Many immigrants with legal status, including H-1B visa holders, and even some naturalised US citizens, said they stayed put.Among H-1B visa holders, about one-third reported choosing not to travel due to immigration concerns. The survey showed the impact of recent policy changes. In July, the US State Department ended remote and third-country renewals for H-1B and H-4 visas, requiring applicants to return to their home countries to complete the process. In September, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing a $100,000 fee on new H-1B applications.The administration also expanded social media screening, reviewing applicants’ digital footprint during the vetting process.These measures strained US consulates and embassies, particularly in India. Interview schedules and visa appointments were postponed by nearly a year, and some as far out as 2027. Hundreds of skilled professionals were left stranded in their home countries after travelling for interviews, separated from jobs and families in US.The survey also shows that travel anxiety is not restricted to H-1B holders. Nearly two-thirds of undocumented immigrants reported avoiding travel, both within the US and abroad.The fear comes after reports that the Transportation Security Administration has shared domestic travel information, including passenger lists, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), according to the American Bazaar. In the past, immigration authorities mostly did not have access to this data. Many immigrants said they are trying to stay under the radar because of closer checks at airports, borders, and other travel points.However, most immigrants said they would still choose to come to the United States if given the chance again, according to the survey.The findings are based on a nationally representative survey of 1,805 immigrant adults currently living in the US.","27 per cent of immigrants said they had avoided trips within the country or overseas to reduce the risk of encounters with immigration authorities.

Trump Ally Japan Erupts Against New US Military Base | 'Won't Let Okinawa Turn Into Battlefield'





US President Donald Trump invited Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi to visit the United States during a phone call on Friday, Japan’s foreign ministry said.The foreign ministry added that the two leaders agreed to coordinate arrangements for a spring visit, which would be Takaichi’s first trip to the US since she took office in October. Kyodo News reported that Japanese officials have proposed late March for the visit, with the schedule possibly aligning with Washington’s annual cherry blossom festival.According to Kyodo News, the call lasted about 25 minutes and focused mainly on developments in the Indo-Pacific region. Takaichi told reporters that she and Trump confirmed the strength of the Japan-US alliance and agreed to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific, as well as cooperation among like-minded countries, including the Japan-US-South Korea partnership.However, the White House has not yet confirmed the call or the invitation, according to the AP.“At the start of the new year, I consider it extremely significant that I was able to exchange words directly with President Trump and confirm the strong partnership of the Japan-US alliance,” Takaichi was quoted as saying by Kyodo News.In its statement, Japan’s foreign ministry said the two leaders affirmed they would “carve out a new chapter in the history of the Japan-U.S.alliance” in a year when the United States marks the 250th anniversary of its independence. They also agreed to further deepen wide-ranging cooperation and friendly relations, including in the economic and security spheres.Takaichi said she conveyed her congratulations to Trump on the milestone anniversary. Kyodo News noted that Japan has pledged to gift 250 cherry trees to the United States as part of the commemorations, building on the tradition that began with Tokyo’s 1912 gift of cherry trees to Washington.The call came against the backdrop of strained regional relations between Japan and China. Beijing staged two-day military exercises in waters off Taiwan this week, AP reported. The drills followed the Trump administration’s announcement of a proposed arms sales package to Taiwan valued at more than $11 billion, which, if approved by Congress, would represent the largest such assistance to the island. China criticised the move sharply.China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and has vowed to seize the self-governed island by force if necessary. The United States is required under domestic law to provide Taiwan with sufficient defence equipment to deter any attack from the mainland.Takaichi, Japan’s first female prime minister, angered Beijing late last year when she said Chinese military action against Taiwan could justify a Japanese military response, departing from the strategic ambiguity maintained by previous leaders.Trump met Takaichi in Tokyo in October shortly after she took office and later addressed US troops aboard an aircraft carrier alongside her. After her remarks on Taiwan drew criticism from Beijing, Trump called her and described them as “extremely good friends” and that she should call him anytime, according to the Japanese leader, Kyodo News reported.","US President Donald Trump invited Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi to visit the United States during a phone call on Friday.

Zohran Mamdani Takes Oath On Quran In Historic First As New York Muslim Mayor | WATCH

.





Less than 24 hours after taking the oath, New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani began his first full day in office with a routine familiar to millions of New Yorkers, a morning subway commute from his Queens apartment.Battling against the cold, the 34-year-old Democrat left the one-bedroom apartment in Queens on Friday. Unlike most commuters, Mamdani’s journey was documented by a photo and video crew with neighbors stopping to wish him luck as he headed to work.The subway ride came ahead of a busy first day that included signing orders, announcing appointments and facing questions from the press. Still, the mayor chose to begin with what aides described as a deliberately symbolic commute.Flanked by security guards and a small group of aides, Mamdani boarded a Manhattan-bound train, pausing to take selfies with surprised riders before settling into a corner seat to review briefing materials. The video of his subway ride went viral across social media.When two French tourists, puzzled by the attention, approached him, Mamdani introduced himself as “the new mayor of New York.” When met with disbelief, he held up the morning’s New York Daily News, which featured his photograph on the front page, according to the Associated Press.Videos of the subway ride began circulating online within minutes of Mamdani’s arrival at City Hall, drawing widespread attention and praise from supporters who viewed the moment as a reflection of his campaign message.While the ride served as a carefully timed public moment, it also aligned with Mamdani’s inaugural pledge to ensure his “government looks and lives like the people it represents.”Several past New York City mayors, including Eric Adams, Bill de Blasio and Michael Bloomberg, have similarly used public transit early in their terms to signal accessibility and to connect with the residents.Mamdani’s first commute was followed by a history-making swearing-in ceremony on Thursday. The Indian-origin leader became New York City’s first South Asian and Muslim mayor, as well as the second-youngest mayor in the city’s history, after taking his oath during a private ceremony at the historic Old City Hall subway station.In a first for the city, Mamdani was sworn in on a Quran from the New York Public Library’s Schomburg Center collection, marking the first time a New York City mayor has taken the oath of office on Islam’s holy text.",New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani began his first full day in office with a routine familiar to millions of New Yorkers.

'NO OIL, GOLD FOR US': Maduro’s Deputy Delcy Rodríguez TRASHES Trump’s Solution To Run Venezuela

Who is

Delcy Rodriguez

Delcy Rodriguez is Venezuela’s executive vice president and was directed by the Supreme Court to serve as interim president after Nicolas Maduro was captured during the US military operation.

She is a trained lawyer from Caracas and studied law at the Central University of Venezuela.

Rodriguez has been a senior figure in the chavismo political movement for more than two decades and is regarded as one of Maduro’s closest and most trusted political allies.

She has held several powerful roles in government, including serving as Venezuela’s foreign minister.

Before assuming the interim role, she was also in charge of key economic portfolios, overseeing finance and the country’s oil sector.

She is the sister of Jorge Rodriguez, the president of Venezuela’s National Assembly, and together they have been central figures in the government since the era of former president Hugo Chavez.





Venezuela’s entered a new and uncertain phase on Saturday after President Nicolas Maduro was captured during a US military operation. With no immediate political transition announced, the country’s Supreme Court stepped in, ordering Vice President Delcy Rodriguez to assume the role of interim president, in line with constitutional provisions dealing with a president’s absence.Rodriguez took charge hours after Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were detained. She chaired a meeting of the National Defence Council the same day, appearing alongside senior ministers and military officials.In the meeting, she demanded the immediate release of Maduro and Flores and strongly condemned the US operation. In a televised address, Rodriguez said the early-morning strike violated international law and Venezuela’s sovereignty. She alsocalled on Venezuelans to remain united and urged governments across Latin America to reject what she described as the use of force against a sovereign nation.Rodriguez also insisted that Maduro remains Venezuela’s legitimate president, despite his capture. “There is only one president in this country, and his name is Nicolas Maduro,” she said during the council meeting broadcast on state television.Trump told reporters following Mudaro's capture that Rodriguez was willing to cooperate with Washington. He said she had spoken at length with Rubio and had shown readiness to do “whatever” the US needed.""I think she was quite gracious,"" Trump added. ""We can't take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn't have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind.""",Rodriguez is Venezuela’s executive vice president and was directed by the Supreme Court to serve as interim president.

At least seven loud explosions were heard across Venezuela’s capital, Caracas (early Saturday), with air sirens and low-flying aircraft adding to the alarm. Several neighborhoods reported panic on the streets and power outages following the blasts.According to AFP, the blasts were heard around 2.00 am local time (0600 GMT). The first explosion was recorded shortly before 1.50 am.“One was so strong, my window was shaking after it,” CNN correspondent Osmary Hernández said.Witnesses reported hearing aircraft overhead following the explosions. Smoke was also visible in the southern part of the city near a major military base, according to Reuters. Videos of the explosions quickly surfaced on social media.President Donald Trump confirmed that US had ordered strikes on sites inside Venezuela, including military facilities. Trump also said that Venezuela's president Nicolás Maduro has been captures along with his wife and flown out of the country.The strikes follow months of American military buildup in the region, including the deployment of the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier and several other warships in the Caribbean.The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has banned American commercial flights from operating in Venezuelan airspace, citing concerns over “ongoing military activity,” shortly before a series of explosions were reported in the capital, news agency AP reported.Several areas of Caracas were left without electricity and residents in multiple neighborhoods rushed out onto the streets.Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro, earlier declared a national emergency after a series of explosions rocked the capital Caracas. The government accused the United States of carrying out “military aggression” against civilian and military installations across multiple states. The government further for 'mobilization' of the population after US 'attack', news agency AFP reported.In a government statement, Venezuelan authorities said the US had attacked strategic sites in several parts of the country.The incident comes amid heightened regional tensions, as US President Donald Trump has recently deployed a naval task force to the Caribbean and raised the possibility of ground strikes against Venezuela. In recent days, the US military has also been targeting alleged drug-smuggling boats in the region.The US Embassy in Bogotá has issued travel advisory urging US citizens not to travel to Venezuela. In its warning issued, the embassy said Americans currently in Venezuela should shelter in place and leave the country as soon as it is safe to do so.The embassy reminded citizens that Venezuela is under a Level 4 “Do Not Travel” advisory, the highest warning level, citing severe risks including wrongful detention, torture in detention, terrorism, kidnapping, crime, civil unrest and poor health infrastructure.The US Department of State withdrew all diplomatic personnel from its embassy in Caracas in March 2019 and suspended operations. As a result, all consular services, including emergency assistance, remain unavailable and the US government has no ability to provide help to American citizens inside Venezuela.The advisory also urged US citizens to establish multiple ways of communicating with family and friends outside Venezuela and to closely monitor developments as the situation unfolds.Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Saturday posted an official statement from the Venezuelan government, in which Caracas accused the United States of carrying out a serious military attack on Venezuelan territory.“The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela rejects, repudiates, and denounces before the international community the extremely serious military aggression perpetrated by the current Government of the United States of America against Venezuelan territory and population,” the statement read.The statement claimed the alleged attack violated the United Nations Charter, citing Articles 1 and 2 on respect for sovereignty and the prohibition of the use of force, and warned that such actions “threaten international peace and stability, specifically in Latin America and the Caribbean, and put the lives of millions of people at grave risk.”According to the statement shared by Petro, the Venezuelan government said the objective of the alleged attack was “to seize Venezuela’s strategic resources, particularly its oil and minerals” and to undermine the country’s political independence. “They will not succeed,” the statement added.Earlier, Maduro had claimed that he was open to negotiating with the United States on issues including drug trafficking, oil and migration. Speaking in a pre-recorded interview aired on Venezuelan state television on Thursday, Maduro said he was ready for dialogue with Washington “wherever they want and whenever they want.”However, Maduro also accused the US of using its months-long pressure campaign as a way to force a change in government and gain access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves.He strongly rejected allegations that his administration is linked to drug cartels, calling the US “war on drugs” a pretext for intervention. Asked directly about President Trump’s claim that American forces had struck a docking facility in Venezuela, Maduro declined to confirm or deny the report, saying it was “something we could talk about in a few days.”On Monday, Trump said the United States had carried out a strike on a “dock area” in Venezuela used by boats allegedly involved in drug trafficking, describing it as a “major explosion.” According to CNN, the blast was caused by a drone strike carried out by the CIA.""There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs. We hit all the boats, and now we hit the area... it's the implementation area,"" Trump said.The remarks came as the US military has intensified operations against suspected drug-smuggling vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.Since September, American forces have carried out more than 30 strikes on boats they say were involved in narcotics trafficking, resulting in over 110 deaths, according to US officials. The latest attack, reported earlier this week, killed five people aboard two boats, the US military said.Trump has repeatedly accused Maduro of flooding the US with drugs and migrants, claims the Venezuelan leader strongly denies. He has also doubled the reward for information leading to Maduro’s capture and threatened to designate his government as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation.","At least seven loud explosions heard across Venezuela’s capital, Caracas (early Saturday), with air sirens and low-flying aircraft adding to the alarm. Several neighborhoods reported panic on the streets and power outages following the blasts. Venezuelan authorities said the US had attacked strategic sites in several parts of the country. US Embassy in Bogotá has issued travel advisory urging US citizens not to travel to Venezuela.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126318568,imgsize-1543738,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Trump To Capture Khamenei After Maduro? Elon Musk's 'Brutal Reality Check' As Riots Kill 16 In Iran





President Donald Trump and Elon Musk seem to have begun their new year on a positive note, appearing to have mended their strained relationship. On Sunday (local time), Tesla CEO took to X and wrote, “Had a lovely dinner last night with @POTUS and @FLOTUS,” adding, “2026 is going to be amazing!”The photograph, taken at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, fuelled speculation that the pair’s much-discussed bromance may be back on after months of public friction.Following the 2024 election campaign, Musk emerged as one of the Republican Party’s largest donors, contributing hundreds of millions of dollars. Trump later appointed him to advise a government efficiency drive and to help set up the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), aimed at cutting federal spending and streamlining operations.Musk, however, stepped back from the role in mid-2025 amid growing criticism. Relations soured further when he openly attacked Trump-backed spending proposals, warning about ballooning federal outlays. “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,” Musk wrote in a June 3 post criticising Trump’s so-called “big beautiful bill,” calling it a “massive, outrageous, pork-filled” measure and a “disgusting abomination. ”Trump responded by saying he was “very disappointed” by Musk’s remarks, adding, “Elon and I had a great relationship.I don’t know if we will anymore.”Musk fired back on X, claiming that without his support Trump would have lost the election, and at one point even floated the idea of launching a new political party.By late 2025, however, both appeared to soften their stance. In September, Trump and Musk were seen shaking hands at conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s memorial service at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.Musk also attended a White House dinner in November, hosted by Trump for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman , signalling a tentative thaw in ties.","President Donald Trump and Elon Musk seem to have mended their strained relationship.

No Maduro, No Successor: Delcy Rodríguez Now Rules Venezuela; New Pres. That Toppled Trump’s Plan





US President Donald Trump has warned Venezuela’s current leader, Delcy Rodriguez, that she could face harsher consequences than former president Nicolas Maduro if she did not cooperate with the United States.Speaking in a telephone interview with The Atlantic on Sunday, Trump said Rodriguez would “pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro” if she failed to “do what’s right”.The comments came a day after Trump had publicly praised Rodriguez, following a dramatic US operation in which American forces seized Maduro and his wife from the Venezuelan capital, Caracas.Rodriguez had said Venezuela would defend its natural resources, a remark that appeared to have hardened Trump’s tone. ""We are ready to defend Venezuela; we are ready to defend our natural resources,"" after US President Donald Trump said Washington intends to ""run"" the Caribbean nation and tap its huge oil reserves.Trump earlier told reporters following Mudaro's capture that US would ""run the country until a safe, proper and judicious transition"" can be ensured, a remark later contradicted by secretary of state Marco Rubio.Trump further said Rodriguez was willing to cooperate with Washington.He said she had spoken at length with Rubio and had shown readiness to do “whatever” the US needed.""I think she was quite gracious,"" Trump added. ""We can't take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn't have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind,"" he said.The Venezuelan court soon appointed Rodriguez as the interim president in line with the US constitution. In her speech soon after Mudaro's capture, Rodriguez rejected the US action outright. She demanded the immediate release of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and called the military operation a violation of international law.“There is only one president in this country, and his name is Nicolas Maduro,” Rodriguez had said, standing alongside senior civilian leaders and top military commanders.","US President Donald Trump has warned Venezuela's current leader, Delcy Rodriguez, that she could face harsher consequences than former president Nicolas Maduro.

What is Temporary Protected Status (TPS)?





Venezuelans in the US under Temporary Protected Status can now apply for refugee status, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Sunday after TPS for the country ended.Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Noem defended the Trump administration’s decision to end the Biden-era TPS designation for Venezuelans, arguing that the measure ensures US immigration programs follow the law. “Venezuela today is more free than it was yesterday,” she said.She added: “Every individual that was under TPS has the opportunity to apply for refugee status. We need to make sure that our programs actually mean something, and that we’re following the law.”Noem’s comments come after the US military captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. She said that US wants a Venezuelan leader who is going to partner with America against drug trafficking and terrorism.Roughly 600,000 Venezuelans legally residing in the US under TPS now face potential deportation to a country whose government remains unstable. Noem said that those affected can now seek refugee status. She said that the termination of TPS was first introduced in 2021 under the Biden administration and was a nationwide decision after the designation was deemed “contrary to the US national interest.”The move stirred a row, particularly in Florida, which is home to over half of Venezuelan TPS holders.Miami Mayor Eileen Higgins called the revocation “reckless, dangerous, and wrong,” urging the administration to reinstate protections.Some Venezuelans celebrated Maduro’s ouster in Miami, while others remained at home, fearing immigration raids. Adelys Ferro of the Venezuelan-American Caucus said, “We are victims of the Nicolás Maduro regime, but we are also victims of the Trump administration policies.”Temporary Protected Status (TPS) is a US immigration program that allows nationals from certain countries experiencing armed conflict, natural disasters, or other harsh conditions to live and work in in US temporarily. It was created in 1990 under the Immigration Act of 1990.TPS does not provide a path to permanent residency or citizenship. The designation is reviewed and can be extended or terminated by DHS.Under the Trump administration’s order, Venezuelans stripped of TPS can now use refugee status as a legal pathway to remain in US, but still face deportation risk.","Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Venezuelans under Temporary Protected Status can now apply for refugee status.

Rubio Grilled, Dubbed 'Viceroy Of Venezuela' On LIVE TV After US Captures Maduro, Trump Declaration





US secretary of state Marco Rubio suggested Sunday that the US would not take a day-to-day role in governing Venezuela other than enforcing an existing “oil quarantine”, a turnaround after President Trump announced a day earlier that the US would be running the country following the capture of President Nicolas Maduro.The softening came even as Trump threatened that Venezuela’s vice-president Delcy Rodriguez, who took over the interim presidency, will pay a “very big price” if she doesn’t cooperate with the US. Rodriguez struck a defiant note, saying, “there is only one president in Venezuela, and his name is Nicolas Maduro”.Venezuela’s defence minister on Sunday rejected any notion that the US would “run” his country, projecting an official line of defiance as the Trump administration said it would seek to exert “leverage” over the country’s leadership. Venezuela’s vice president Delcy Rodriguez assumed the interim presidency on Sunday and struck a defiant note. “There is only one president in Venezuela, and his name is Nicolas Maduro. We will never again be a colony of any empire,” she said.The White House has said it believes that the interim leader will fall in line and largely comply with its demands. The nature of the private conversations between Venezuela’s govt and US officials is unclear.Publicly, Rodriguez and the defence minister, Vladimir Padrino Lopez, have said the govt that was in place under Maduro is still in charge. In a fiery speech broadcast Sunday on state television, Padrino Lopez channelled decades of Venezuelan nationalism and said that the country’s armed forces would “continue to employ all its available capabilities for military defence, the maintenance of internal order and the preservation of peace. ” “Our sovereignty has been violated and breached,” he said, backed by uniformed soldiers. Lopez also said that US forces had killed a “large part” of Maduro’s security detail in the raid that apprehended him, part of a death toll of soldiers and civilians that rose to 80 on Sunday.Maduro is in a Brooklyn jail with his wife, who were both indicted on federal drug trafficking and weapons charges. They are expected to make their initial appearances in federal court on Monday.In a series of television appearances on Sunday, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said that the US military would maintain a “quarantine” around Venezuela to prevent the entry and exit of oil tankers under American sanctions. But though President Donald Trump has said the US intends to “run” Venezuela and reclaim American oil interests after ousting Maduro, Pentagon officials said that there were currently no US military personnel in the country.In an interview with CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” Rubio said that the large US naval force amassed in the Caribbean Sea off Venezuela will remain “until we see changes, not just to further the national interest of the US, which is No. 1, but also that lead to a better future for the people of Venezuela.”Rubio also said the US is ready to work with Venezuela’s remaining leaders if they make “the right decision”. He appeared to significantly soften President Trump’s extraordinary statements on Saturday that the US will “run” Venezuela and that he would not be afraid to put military “boots on the ground”. Instead, he made clear that Washington is ready to try working with Rodriguez, and the rest of the ousted leader’s cabinet.","Rubio Grilled, Dubbed 'Viceroy Of Venezuela' On LIVE TV After US Captures Maduro, Trump Declaration.
