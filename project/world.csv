She was found guilty of six counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child, including two counts while being in a position of trust.Passing sentence at Manchester Crown Court in northwestern England, Judge Kate Cornell told Joynes she had exhibited ""breathtaking arrogance.""""You were the person in control, the person who should have known better,"" Judge Cornell said.

Zelenskiy warned that any proposal must avoid violating Ukraine’s sovereignty.Putin told reporters that he saw some of last week’s election debate between Trump and Joe Biden but declined to comment on it. President Biden is facing growing pressure to drop his reelection bid following criticism of his poor performance in the debate.Trump hasn’t explained how he believes he’ll bring an end to the war that’s now in its third year. Politico reported this week that he’s considering a deal with Russia under which NATO would commit not to expand further east, including to Ukraine and Georgia, citing two national security experts aligned with the former president.Putin said last month that Ukraine had to pull out of four eastern regions partly occupied by Russian forces as a condition for peace talks. Under his terms, immediately rejected by Kyiv and its US and European allies, Ukraine would also have to rule out ever joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.Putin said in Astana that Russia won’t declare a halt to fighting before Ukraine agrees to take “irreversible” steps demanded by Moscow, without specifying what those would be.“A cease-fire without reaching such agreements is impossible,” he said.The Russian president also ruled out a resumption of talks with the US on strategic stability until after the election. Russia must first “understand the moods and preferences of the future administration,” Putin said.Separately, European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said it would be “very difficult to continue arming Ukraine” without US support.“Will Europeans be able to continue supporting Ukraine militarily even if the US doesn’t?” Borrell said at a meeting in Madrid of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “It’s certainly difficult but not impossible.

Keir Starmer was born in London in 1962 and grew up in the town of Oxted, Surrey, where he was raised by his toolmaker father and NHS nurse mother.[3]

He was politically active from a young age, joining the Labour Party Young Socialists at 16.

Starmer has a strong academic background, holding a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Leeds and a postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law degree from the University of Oxford.

Prior to entering politics, Starmer had a successful career as a human rights barrister, serving as a human rights adviser to the Northern Ireland Policing Board and being appointed Queen's Counsel in 2002.

Starmer was Director of Public Prosecutions from 2008 to 2013, where he dealt with high-profile cases like the Stephen Lawrence murder.

He was elected to the House of Commons in 2015 as the MP for Holborn and St Pancras, a safe Labour seat.

Starmer supported the unsuccessful Britain Stronger in Europe campaign during the 2016 Brexit referendum, but later advocated for a second referendum under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.

After Corbyn's resignation, Starmer won the 2020 Labour leadership election on a left-wing platform, positioning himself as a more centrist, pragmatic leader.[3]

As Labour leader, Starmer has sought to distance the party from the Corbyn era, emphasizing a more professional and electorally viable approach.[1][4]

Starmer is known for his vegetarianism, self-professed socialism, and a reputation that divides opinions, with some viewing him as moving towards the right in his pursuit of power.

Here are Keir Starmer's key policies as the likely next UK PM:

Economic stability: Starmer has pledged to ""deliver economic stability "" by sticking to ""tough spending rules"" and focusing on growing the economy. He has avoided making big-spending promises, instead emphasizing fiscal responsibility.

NEW DELHI: Exit polls for the 2024 UK general elections have predicted a resounding win for the opposition Labour party and an end to the nearly 15-year-long Conservative rule. The final results are expected to be announced by late Friday morning (IST).The first national ballot since Boris Johnson won the Conservative party a decisive victory in 2019 follows Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's surprise call to hold an election six months earlier than required.His gamble looks set to backfire spectacularly, with exit polls pointing to a heavy defeat for his right-wing party.The Centre-left Labour is projected to win its first general election since 2005 by historic proportions.With the exit polls out, 61-year-old Labour leader Keir Starmer seems set to be the next resident of 10 Downing Street, as leader of the largest party in parliament.Results from the UK's 650 constituencies trickle in overnight, with the winning party expected to hit 326 seats -- the threshold for a parliamentary majority -- as dawn breaks on Friday.Polls suggest voters will punish the Tories after 14 years of often chaotic rule and could oust a string of government ministers, with talk that even Sunak himself might not be safe. That would make him the first sitting prime minister not to retain his seat in a general election.","Keir Starmer was born in London in 1962 and grew up in the town of Oxted, Surrey. He has a strong academic background, holding a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Leeds. Starmer is known for his vegetarianism, self- professed socialism, and a reputation that divides opinions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111496441,imgsize-29850,width-400,resizemode-4/111496441.jpg"
2024 United Kingdom elections: What do the exit polls say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/2024-united-kingdom-elections-what-do-the-exit-polls-say/articleshow/111496405.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Keir Starmer's Labour Party is poised to win a historic victory in the UK general election, ending 14 years of Conservative rule , according to exit polls released shortly after voting ended on Thursday.Labour is projected to secure 410 seats in the 650-seat parliament, while Rishi Sunak 's Conservatives are forecast to win only 131 seats, down from 346 previously.The Liberal Democrats are predicted to capture 61 seats, and Nigel Farage's Reform UK party is expected to win 13 seats. The exit poll represents a significant turnaround for Labour, which faced an existential crisis just three years ago.Voters appear to have punished the Conservatives for the cost-of-living crisis, years of instability, and in-fighting that has seen five different prime ministers since 2016. Sunak's campaign was plagued by gaffes, including getting drenched by rain while announcing the election and leaving D-Day commemorations early for a TV interview.While polls suggest there is no great enthusiasm for Starmer, his message of change seems to have resonated with voters. The disenchanted British public has moved to the center-left, unlike in France where the far-right National Rally party made historic gains in a recent election.If the exit poll proves accurate, Starmer will become Britain's next prime minister, and Sunak will resign, meeting with King Charles to seek permission to form a new government.","Labour is projected to secure 410 seats in the 650-seat parliament.

Instead, the champ will live-stream his own July 4 hot dog event from a Texas military base.In his absence, a field of 15 lesser-knowns will battle for the vacated ""Mustard Belt"" that goes to the winner.Later in the day, the Macy's department store chain will stage its 48th annual Fourth of July fireworks show along the Hudson for the first time in a decade. In recent years, the spectacle was staged along the East River.Launched from barges moored in the river, some 60,000 shells will travel about 1,000 feet (300 meters) high before exploding into dozens of colours and special effects sure to delight tens of thousands of spectators who will line both sides of the Hudson, which separates Manhattan from New Jersey.Across the country, other cities are hosting fireworks shows, road races, baseball games and other events that will give people the chance to forget their troubles and relax.In Southern California, Huntington Beach will hold what it has branded as ""the largest Independence Day celebration west of the Mississippi.""

Liberal pundits and pollsters make the case for Kamala Harris to replace Biden,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/liberal-pundits-and-pollsters-make-the-case-for-kamala-harris-to-replace-biden/articleshow/111491489.cms,"WASHINGTON: Pragmatic pundits, pollsters, and people of Democratic persuasion are starting to line up behind vice-president Kamala Harris as the putative party nominee for the White House even as President Joe Biden is tenaciously hanging on to his bid for second term.A decision on whether Biden will renounce his candidacy or continue his campaign is just hours or days away.But there is growing clamor for Harris to step up despite residual doubts about whether she is well-placed to defeat Donald Trump.Biden is expected to make a call on whether he will continue or withdraw from the race after a weekend interview and public events that could show if he is still fit for the job -- or not.Reasons being advanced to promote Harris to replace Biden as the Democratic nominee range from the practical and pragmatic to the logical and logistical. She has already been vetted and is on the Biden-Harris ticket that has all but sewn up the nomination which means she could easily inherit the campaign infrastructure and finances.Political strategists say picking anyone other than Harris would ""represents a legal, political and financial minefield,"" because it would ""raise questions about the status of the delegates whom Biden and Harris have won — and the nearly quarter-billion dollars in their campaign coffers, money that cannot easily or perhaps even legally be handed to someone else.""Anyone aiming to replace Biden would have to have a campaign up and running -- and line up new finances -- within weeks if not days, both considered almost impossible.Although Harris' performance as vice-president has not impressed many, she does have national name recognition. Others prominent Democrats spoken as potential nominees, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, are popular in their home state but lack national appeal.Party flacks do not seriously consider outliers such as Michelle Obama in the mix.Democrat insiders also cite optics, arguing that as the first Black and Asian-American woman to be elected to vice-presidency, denying Harris the top nomination in favor of a white male candidate could alienate minorities whose support is crucial to win the White House.Polls show that Harris performs much better against Trump than any other potential Democratic nominee, although a poll cited by Daily Mail -- which had a lead story headlined: President Kamala? Why Democrat insiders fear it's now INEVITABLE that Harris will replace Biden -- showed her losing to Trump by eleven points.Some of the governors being urged to run have already indicated they are not jumping into the fray at this late stage, even as party grandees are preparing to the ground for a Harris nomination.Among them is South Carolina lawmaker Jim Clyburn, whose endorsement of Biden turned around the race in 2020, and who has said he would support Kamala Harris this time around if she were the nominee.On the downside, pundits point out that Harris' fared disastrously in the 2020 race, dropping out of the Presidential contest after a campaign meltdown. Her performance as vice-president has also been unspectacular.Kamala skeptics also warn that inasmuch as she might win minority votes, her candidacy could alienate white suburban voters in swing states that Democrats need to clinch the White House.Harris herself has been circumspect so far about keeping the Oval Office in her sights as she continues to back Biden, saying voters should look at his successful 3½ years in office, not his 90 minutes of struggling in a debate.In a CBS News interview on Tuesday, she declined to answer a question about whether she is ready to lead the country if Biden is unable to, countering that she is “proud to be Joe Biden’s running mate.”“Look, Joe Biden is our nominee. We beat Trump once, and we’re going to beat him again. Period.” she said.",Biden is expected to make a call on whether he will continue or withdraw from the race after a weekend interview and public events that could show if he is still fit for the job -- or not. There is growing clamor for Harris to step up despite residual doubts about whether she is well-placed to defeat Donald Trump.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111491579,imgsize-632792,width-400,resizemode-4/111491579.jpg"

He is also facing prosecution in the cipher and Iddat cases.In an opinion released on Monday, the Geneva-based UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention concluded that Imran’s detention had no legal basis, and appeared to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office. “…From the outset, that prosecution was not grounded in law and was reportedly instrumentalised for a political purpose,” it stated, adding that Imran’s legal woes were part of a “much larger campaign of repression” against him and his party.In the run-up to the 2024 general election, the working group report stated, PTI members were arrested and tortured and their rallies were disrupted. It also alleged “widespread fraud on the election day”.The “appropriate remedy would be to release Mr Khan immediately and accord him an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, in accordance with international law”, the UN working group said.Imran and his party have always maintained that the charges against him are politically motivated and aimed at thwarting his return to power.In recent months, courts have suspended Imran’s sentence in some cases and also overturned his conviction on charges of leaking state secrets. However, he has remained behind bars following his conviction in the Iddat case, with a trial court ruling that Imran’s 2018 marriage had violated Islamic law. Khan also faces a trial under anti-terrorism charges in connection with the violence in May last year.Responding to the UN report, Pakistan’s law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said, “As a sovereign state, the constitution and prevailing laws are enforced by courts in Pakistan. PTI founder has all rights as per the national constitution and law and international norms. He is in jail as a convicted prisoner.”In his statement, Tarar said court relief to the PTI founder in some of the cases was “a reflection of a transparent and fair trial and judicial system”. “Any demand beyond the constitution, law and international norms will be called discriminatory, biased and unfair,” he added.Last Friday, Pakistan’s parliament had denounced a US congressional resolution that called for an independent investigation into allegations that the country’s elections were rigged.",Imran Khan has been in jail since August last year following his conviction in a Toshakhana case.
