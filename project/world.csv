‘Can happen to India’: Chavan slams Centre for not taking stance on Venezuela; claims govt ‘scared of Americans’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-happen-to-india-chavan-slams-centre-for-not-taking-stance-on-venezuela-claims-govt-scared-of-americans/articleshow/126365565.cms,"CPI-M Protests Near Us Consulate In Chennai Over Venezuela Attack

NEW DELHI: Former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan on Tuesday stirred a controversy after he criticised the government for not taking a stand after the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, saying such an incident could also happen to India.“Whatever has happened in Venezuela is against the UN Charter. An elected president has been kidnapped. It's a very grave concern that it could happen to any other country tomorrow. Tomorrow it can happen to India,” Chavan said.“India has not spoken as usual, not taken a stand on the Venezuela matter. Russia and China have taken a stand and criticised what America has done. The same thing happened in the Ukraine war. We did not take any side. We did not take a stand on the Israel-Hamas matter, and now here we are, so scared of Americans that we are not even trying to criticise what has happened,” he added.This comes after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured in Caracas and flown out of the country on Saturday in a joint operation involving intelligence agencies and US law enforcement.Subsequently, the ministry of external affairs reiterated India’s support for the safety and well-being of people in Venezuela as the situation in the country remains tense amid US strikes.“Recent developments in Venezuela are a matter of deep concern. We are closely monitoring the evolving situation,” the MEA said in a statement.“We call upon all concerned to address issues peacefully through dialogue, ensuring peace and stability in the region. The Embassy of India in Caracas is in contact with members of the Indian community and will continue to provide all possible assistance,” it added.Meanwhile, this is not the first time Chavan has made headlines for controversial remarks. Earlier in December, Chavan claimed that India was defeated on the first day of Operation Sindoor and that Indian aircraft were shot down during the four-day conflict.“On the first day (of Operation Sindoor), we were completely defeated. In the half-hour aerial engagement that took place on the 7th, we were fully defeated, whether people accept it or not. Indian aircraft were shot down. The Air Force was completely grounded, and not a single aircraft flew. If any aircraft had taken off from Gwalior, Bathinda, or Sirsa, there was a high probability of being shot down by Pakistan, which is why the Air Force was fully grounded,” the Congress leader said.Later, Chavan refused to apologise for his controversial statement and said, “Why will I apologise? It is out of the question. The Constitution gives me the right to ask questions.”","Prithviraj Chavan criticised the government for not taking a stand after the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. “Whatever has happened in Venezuela is against the UN Charter.

Ambala man arrested for allegedly spying on Air Force; under investigation



NEW DELHI: In two separate cases of alleged espionage reported within 24 hours, authorities in Punjab and Haryana have arrested a 15-year-old boy from Pathankot and a contractor from Ambala for allegedly sharing sensitive defence-related information with Pakistan-linked handlers. Police in both states said the accused were in contact with individuals across the border and had passed on details connected to key security installations.A 15-year-old boy from Pathankot has been arrested for allegedly sharing information related to national security with Pakistan's ISI , terror outfits, and Pakistan military officers, Punjab Police said on Tuesday.Police identified the juvenile as Sanjeev Kumar . According to officials, he was tricked by Pakistani handlers on social media. Police said he believed that his father had been murdered, which made him emotionally vulnerable.SSP Pathankot Daljinder Singh Dhillon said, ""The police have arrested Sanjeev Kumar, aged 15, after receiving information that he had been supplying information related to the security of our nation to the frontal organisations of terror agencies, ISI, and Pakistan military officers.""He added that the boy was drawn in by Pakistani accounts online.""He fell into the trap of Pakistani agencies through social media, as he was suspicious that his father had been murdered, which affected him mentally. However, the investigation did not reveal any such evidence,"" Dhillon said.According to police, Sanjeev had sent videos of several sensitive locations and had been in contact with gangsters based in Pakistan who run terror modules. ""He had been in contact with Pakistan’s terror organisations for almost a year,"" the SSP said.Police are investigating how much information he shared and who he was in contact with. The boy is currently in custody, and further action will be taken based on the investigation.In an another incident in neighbouring state -- Haryana, another man in Ambala was held for allegedly spying on Air Force, as confirmed by DSP Crime on Tuesday.DSP Crime Virendra Kumar said the accused, Sunil alias Sunny, had been a contractor handling repair work at an Air Force station since 2020.“The police had information that he was providing details about our defence area, specifically the Air Force. His mobile was seized and several suspicious things emerged from it,” Kumar said.The officer added that Sunil had been in contact with a woman who allegedly asked for information, which he passed on. “According to his device, he used to send information to a neighbouring country, which we can call an enemy country. But this is his version. Investigation is ongoing,” he said.Sunil is married with two children and is currently on four days of remand. The probe is in its initial stages.","A 15-year-old boy from Pathankot has been arrested for allegedly sharing information related to national security with Pakistan's ISI, terror outfits, and Pakistan military officers.

What explains inconsistencies in deciding bail pleas in recent past



NEW DELHI: Holding that delay in trial and long incarceration cannot be a “trump card” to get bail in UAPA offences and that a court cannot treat liberty of an accused as the sole criterion and societal security as peripheral, Supreme Court Monday rejected bail pleas of student activists Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam in the Delhi riots case but granted relief to other five co-accused — Gulfisha Fatima, Meeran Haider, Shifa-ur-Rehman, Mohd Saleem Khan and Shadab Ahmad.The case relates to protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act turning violent, leading to communal clashes during the visit of US President Trump in 2020.Khalid and Imam, who along with others have been in jail for over five years, may have to spend another year in prison as the bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and N V Anjaria said they can apply afresh after a year or after all protected witnesses have been examined, whichever is earlier.The bench cited “hierarchy of culpability” to say Khalid and Imam stood on a different footing than the others.Granting bail is the discretionary power of a court and the outcome of a bail plea largely depends on the approach of a bench and that perhaps explains inconsistency of Supreme Court’s in the recent past in deciding cases, particularly those related to serious offences under special acts like PMLA and UAPA which provide stringent bail conditions..In some cases, like those of former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and Tamil Nadu minister, Senthil Balaji, accused's constitutional right to speedy trial was given precedence over the seriousness of the alleged offence and bail was granted on the ground of long incarceration and delay in trial. In some others; for instance, Gurvinder Singh v State of Punjab, gravity of the offence has been the deciding factor, with SC expressly cautioning against the mechanical invocation of prolonged incarceration as a ground for bail in cases involving serious offences under special enactments.While dealing in UAPA case, a three judge bench had in 2021 held that Section 43D(5) of UAPA per se does not prevent constitutional courts to grant bail on grounds of violation of fundamental rights of accused.""Courts are expected to appreciate legislative policy against grant of bail but the rigours of such provisions will melt down where there is no likelihood of trial being completed within a reasonable time and the period of incarceration already undergone has exceeded a substantial part of the prescribed sentence,"" Justice Surya Kant, now the CJI, who penned the judgement for the bench said.Justice Kant had said such an approach would safeguard against the possibility of provisions like Section 43D (5) of UAPA being used as the sole metric for denial of bail or for wholesale breach of constitutional right to speedy trial.While rejecting bail plea of Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam, a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and N V Anjaria referred to 2021 judgement and said ""The same decision, however, does not indicate as laying down a mechanical rule under which the mere passage of time becomes determinative in every case arising under a special statute. The jurisprudence of this Court does not support a construction whereby delay simpliciter eclipses a statutory regime enacted by Parliament to address offences of a special category. ""It said the proper constitutional question, therefore, is not whether Article 21 (right to life and liberty) is superior to Section 43D (5) of UAPA dealing with the higher bail threshold. ""The proper question is how Article 21 is to be applied where Parliament has expressly conditioned the grant of bail in relation to offences alleged to implicate national security. The law does not contemplate an either-or approach. Nor does it contemplate an unstructured blending of statutory and constitutional considerations. What is required is disciplined judicial scrutiny that gives due regard to both"".While granting bail to an accused in 2024 who was under custody for four years and trial had not initiated, SC had said the ""the over-arching postulate of criminal jurisprudence that an accused is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty cannot be brushed aside lightly, howsoever stringent the penal law may be"".The court had said, ""If the State or any prosecuting agency including the court concerned has no wherewithal to provide or protect the fundamental right of an accused to have a speedy trial as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution then the State or any other prosecuting agency should not oppose the plea for bail on the ground that the crime committed is serious. Article 21 of the Constitution applies irrespective of the nature of the crime. ”In an important ruling, SC in 2024 held that the conventional idea ‘bail is the rule, jail is an exception’ should be applicable not only to IPC offences but also other offences for which special statutes have been enacted like UAPA if the conditions prescribed under that law are fulfilled.In cases of Khalid and Imam the court emphasised that they also contributed to the delay in trial.",Supreme Court Monday rejected bail pleas of student activists Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam in the Delhi riots case.

"Fearless judges bedrock of judiciary, can’t be penalised for error of judgment: Supreme Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fearless-judges-bedrock-of-judiciary-cant-be-penalised-for-error-of-judgment-supreme-court/articleshow/126363824.cms,"Probes based on motivated complaints will hit functioning of trial judiciary : SC



NEW DELHI: Observing that a fearless judge is the bedrock of an independent judiciary, Supreme Court on Monday held that disciplinary proceedings can’t be initiated against a judge for an error of judgment on their part. It also expressed concern over frivolous complaints being filed against members of judiciary, which lead to trial court judges treading with trepidation with regard to bail matters.Coming to the rescue of a trial judge whose services were terminated by Madhya Pradesh high court for an error of judgment in grant of bail to an accused, a bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan said it is not the correctness of the verdict but the conduct of the judicial officer in question which is determinative. While HC must immediately intervene when an allegation against a judge is true “to weed out black sheep sullying the fair name of the judiciary”, it must also defend a judge facing false and anonymous complaints, the court said. “A fearless judge is the bedrock of an independent judiciary, as much as an independent judiciary itself is the foundation on which rule of law rests.”A judicial officer is tasked with the onerous duty of deciding cases.Invariably, one party to the case would lose and go back unhappy. Disgruntled elements amongst them, wanting to settle scores, may raise frivolous allegations. The trial judiciary also has tremendous work pressure and works under trying working conditions. Large number of cases are listed in a day and most of the judicial officers give their very best while discharging their duties,” Justice Viswanathan, who penned the judgment, said.The functioning of trial judiciary would be seriously impacted and fearless discharge of duties would become a casualty if inquiries are launched on ill-conceived or motivated complaints, the court said, pointing out that a wrong decision can be a bona fide error of judgment.“It should be ensured that only because an order is wrong or there is an error of judgment, without anything more, a judicial officer is not put through the ordeal of a disciplinary proceeding or a prosecution... When false allegations fly thick and fast, the judicial officers cannot react. Here is where the high court, which is vested with the supervisory control, has to exercise great caution and circumspection,” the bench said while quashing the HC order and directing that the judicial officer be reinstated with back wages.The court said there was no merit in the allegation against the judge and the integrity of a judge cannot be questioned merely because of an erroneous order. “It will be a dangerous proposition to hold that judgments and orders which do not refer expressly to statutory provisions are per se dishonest judgments.”Justice Pardiwala said that initiation of departmental proceedings on mere suspicion is one of the primary reasons trial court judges are reluctant to exercise their discretion for grant of bail, resulting in HCs and SC being flooded with bail pleas. “It should not happen that because of the lurking fear in the mind of a trial court judge, of some administrative action being taken, that even in a deserving case, well within the principles of law, bail is declined. .. Over a period of time, the trial court judges have exhibited tendency to shirk from their solemn judicial function and responsibility when it comes to exercising discretion in matters relating to bail,” he said.","Supreme Court held that disciplinary proceedings can’t be initiated against a judge for an error of judgment on their part.

Mobin, who spent over 13 years in prison, was declared a juvenile in conflict with law, rendering his continued detention unlawful under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act.The order was passed by a division bench comprising justices Ravindra Maithani and Ashish Naithani.Mobin had been convicted of murder and robbery under sections 302 and 393 of IPC by the additional district and sessions judge in Roorkee on Feb 15, 2008. His conviction was later upheld by HC on March 20, 2013, with the Supreme Court dismissing his appeal for grant of innocence in Aug 2013.The case dated back to June 24, 2003, when Mobin and four others — Imran, Shaharwan, Mustakeem and Farman — intercepted two men travelling on a scooter near Kaliyar in Roorkee. One of the victims, Jaipal Singh, was killed, while the other, Mahendra Singh, sustained injuries and was robbed.During the course of trial, Mustakeem and Farman were declared juveniles, while the remaining three, including Mobin, were sentenced as adults.Several years after his conviction, Mobin filed an application from jail, stating that he too had been a minor on the date of the offence, requesting that his case be reconsidered in light of the applicable juvenile law. The HC received this communication on June 15, 2021, and subsequently sought a report from police to verify his age. However, the report failed to offer a conclusive determination.On Aug 19, 2025, the court directed its registrar (judicial) to conduct an independent inquiry into Mobin’s age at the time of the incident. The registrar submitted a detailed report based on school records, witness statements and official documents, confirming that Mobin’s date of birth was May 22, 1988 — a finding the court deemed credible and reliable.","Uttarakhand high court has ordered the release of a man who had been serving a life sentence in a 2003 murder case.

'Can Raise Tariffs Very Quickly': Trump Warns India Over Russian Oil Imports, Praises PM Modi

ji

NEW DELHI: Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Monday likened US President Donald Trump to dictators Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini over the United States’ actions in Venezuela. He also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for allegedly yielding to Trump’s demand to cut India’s purchase of oil from Russia, which has been at war with Ukraine since February 2022.“What is happening in Venezuela today is not good for the world. Trump is trying to frighten people across the globe,” Kharge told reporters in Delhi, referring to the US military action in Venezuela that led to the ouster of Maduro. The Venezuelan leader and his wife were then takento New York to face multiple charges, primarily related to narco-terrorism.Alleging that the US president was indulging in “expansionism,” the Congress chief said that leaders who attempt to expand their territories, like Hitler and Mussolini, “do not remain in power for long.”Kharge further referred to Trump's repeated claim about ending the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict, saying that he has repeated his claim around 70 times.""What does it mean? That he (Trump) is a tall personality and he can make the world bow to him. But the world won't bow before him. We live in a democracy, only through a democratic method we have to go ahead...Nehru's policy was 'live and let live'. That is our policy,"" he added.Reacting to Trump’s recent statement that Prime Minister Narendra Modi knows he (Trump) is unhappy with India’s continued purchase of Russian oil, Kharge invoked a dialogue from the 1989 Hindi film ""Mr. India.""“It shows that PM Modi is under Trump’s control. I am reminded of a dialogue from Mr. India — ‘Mogambo khush hua’ (Mogambo is happy). If people with such a mindset try to scare the world, India is not going to cower. But I do not understand why Modi ji is bending before him. This is harmful for the nation. Stand for the country. You nod to whatever he says. The country did not elect you just to nod,” the veteran politician remarked.The US has imposed 50% tariffs on India, with the second 25% tranche linked to New Delhi’s purchase of Russian oil. Washington has accused India of “funding Putin’s war machine” in Ukraine.The Republican leader has also repeatedly claimed that he used trade leverage to push India and Pakistan into a ceasefire agreement. However, New Delhi has consistently maintained that the ceasefire talks were a bilateral matter and were held following a request from Islamabad.","Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge likened US President Donald Trump to dictators Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.

BJP Welcomes SC Denial Of Bail To Umar Khalid And Sharjeel Imam; Opposition Calls It Unfortunate

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan on Monday came out in support of New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani for writing a letter to 2020 Delhi riots co-accused Umar Khalid.Chavan said that, as a person of Indian origin, Mamdani had “every right to intervene.”“He (Mamdani) has faith in Indian politics. He spoke in Hindi during his campaign, appealing to Indians there. Indian blood flows in him, so if injustice is happening to an Indian, he has every right to intervene, whether he is an American citizen or not. But more importantly, human rights are supreme. So I think there’s no need to panic if he wrote a letter,” Chavan told news agency PTI.The socialist Democrat, New York City’s first Muslim and Indian-origin mayor, is the son of filmmaker Mira Nair and academic Mahmood Mamdani. The 34-year-old was sworn in on New Year’s Day after winning the mayoral election in November last year.In his handwritten note to Khalid, who has been in jail since his arrest in September 2020, months after communal riots rocked the national capital in February that year, Mamdani wrote: “Dear Umar, I think of your words on bitterness often, and the importance of not letting it consume oneself. It was a pleasure to meet your parents.We are all thinking of you.”The Supreme Court on Monday rejected the bail pleas of two Delhi riots accused—Khalid and Sharjeel Imam—and granted bail, subject to conditions, to five others. They had challenged the Delhi high court’s rejection of their pleas.Meanwhile, Chavan’s remarks come days after he drew flak for claiming that India was “defeated” on the first day of its four-day conflict with Pakistan in May 2025.

SC Rejects Bail Plea Of Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam; Grants Bail To 5 Others In Delhi Riots Case

What the court said

What the Supreme Court said:

The court observed that Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam stand on a “qualitatively different footing” compared to the other accused, both in terms of the prosecution’s case and the evidence on record.

The SC said their roles were “central” to the alleged offences.

The bench noted that although their incarceration has been long and continuous, it does not violate constitutional guarantees nor override the statutory bar on bail under the applicable law.

The Supreme Court held that the prosecution material discloses a prima facie case against Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam.

It said the statutory threshold for denying bail under the law stands attracted in their case.

At the present stage of the proceedings, the court ruled that they do not deserve to be released on bail.

Activists Gulfisha Fatima, Meeran Haider, Shifa Ur Rehman, Mohd. Saleem Khan, and Shadab Ahmad, however, were granted bail by the Supreme Court.

BJP Claims Rahul Gandhi Ties To ‘Anti-India’ Panel Over US Lawmakers' Umar Khalid Letter

The case so far

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday pronounced its verdict on Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and several others, rejecting their bail plea in the Delhi 2020 riots case.A bench comprising Justices Aravind Kumar and N.V. Anjaria rejected the bail pleas of Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam, saying that the two stand on different footing and it can't be ignored in terms of parity and culpabilty.""Khalid and Imam can pray for bail after one year,"" the SC added, saying that that terrorist act under UAPA is not confined to conventional warfare but includes all acts of attacking national integrity and sovereignity.The accused had challenged a Delhi High Court order refusing them bail in a case under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) linked to the alleged larger conspiracy behind the 2020 north-east Delhi riots.The SC however granted bail to Gulfisha Fatima, Meeran Haider, Shifa Ur Rehman, Mohd. Saleem Khan, and Shadab Ahmad.Counsel appearing for the accused had argued primarily on the prolonged incarceration of the petitioners and the uncertainty over the commencement of the trial. They had told the court that the accused have been in custody for more than five years despite facing serious charges under the UAPA, and contended that there was no evidence to show that they had instigated violence during the riots even after such a long period.Opposing the pleas, the Delhi Police had maintained that the alleged offences amounted to a deliberate attempt to destabilise the state. It argued that the violence was not the result of spontaneous protests but part of a well-planned “pan-India” conspiracy aimed at “regime change” and “economic strangulation”.The police further submitted that the conspiracy was allegedly timed to coincide with the official visit of the then US President to India, with the objective of attracting international media attention and globalising opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The CAA, it said, was deliberately chosen as a “radicalising catalyst” under the guise of “peaceful protest”.According to the prosecution, the “deep-rooted, premeditated and pre-planned conspiracy” allegedly orchestrated by the accused led to the deaths of 53 people and extensive damage to public property, resulting in the registration of 753 FIRs in Delhi alone. It also claimed that evidence on record indicated an attempt to replicate the conspiracy on a pan-India scale, citing, among other things, the use of various WhatsApp groups, including the Delhi Protest Support Group (DPSG) and the Jamia Awareness Campaign Team.The Delhi Police argued that delays in the trial were attributable to the accused themselves and submitted that, if they cooperated, the trial could be concluded within two years.On September 2, the Delhi High Court denied bail to Imam, Khalid and seven others — Mohd Saleem Khan, Shifa Ur Rehman, Athar Khan, Meeran Haider, Shadab Ahmed, Abdul Khalid Saifi and Gulfisha Fatima. On the same day, another high court bench rejected the bail plea of co-accused Tasleem Ahmed.In its order, the high court observed that, prima facie, the role attributed to Imam and Khalid in the alleged conspiracy was “grave”, noting that they had delivered inflammatory speeches along communal lines to “instigate mass mobilisation of members of the Muslim community”.","SC Rejects Bail Plea Of Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam; Grants Bail To 5 Others In Delhi Riots Case.

""Any command from Sri Akal Takht Sahib Ji is accepted with full reverence and will be obeyed.

HYDERABAD: A 27-year-old woman from Hyderabad, Nikitha Godishala, employed in Columbia, in the US state of Maryland, was found murdered in the apartment of an Indian man who is believed to have fled to India.Howard County police confirmed that the man, Arjun Sharma (26), is wanted on first- and second-degree murder charges.Howard County police discovered Nikitha's body on Jan 3 at the 10100 block of Twin Rivers Road, Columbia, following a search of Sharma's apartment. Sharma had reported Nikitha missing on Jan 2. Nikitha, who lived in nearby Ellicott City, had gone to Sharma's residence on Dec 31 to collect money he had borrowed from her, according to her cousin, Saraswati.Saraswati claimed Nikitha had initially sent Sharma $4,500, of which he had returned $3,500. When he requested an additional $1,000, she refused and asked him to return the outstanding amount from the earlier loan, she said. Sharma assured her he would pay, prompting Nikitha to visit him at his apartment where she was murdered.Howard County police confirmed on Jan 4 that Nikitha's body bore stab wounds.Speaking to the media in Secunderabad, Nikitha's father, Anand Godishala, clarified reports labelling Sharma as her ex-boyfriend.""The alleged culprit is not her ex-boyfriend. Please do not report it like that. He was one of the four housemates in the flat where she stayed and moved away.

The cremation will be held at Vaikunth smashanbhumi in Navi Peth, Pune, at 3.30 pm.Kalmadi was a veteran politician and sports administrator who served as the president of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and played a key role in India’s sports administration for several years.He came under national scrutiny in connection with the 2010 Commonwealth Games corruption case and was booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act for alleged misappropriation of Games funds. He was arrested in April 2011, following which the Congress suspended him from the party.Despite the controversy, Kalmadi continued to wield influence in sports bodies. In 2016, he and Abhay Singh Chautala were appointed life presidents of the IOA by a panel of over 150 members.However, after the Union sports minister sought a probe into the decision, Kalmadi declined the honour, stating in a letter to then IOA president N Ramachandran that the timing was not appropriate for him to accept the post.Before entering politics, Kalmadi served in the Indian Air Force as a pilot from 1964 to 1972, and retired from service in 1974. He later entered public life and went on to serve as Minister of State for Railways between 1995 and 1996 during a Congress-led government.","Former Union minister and ex-IOA chief Suresh Kalmadi passes away in Pune.

Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro made his first appearance in a US courtroom on Monday following his capture, entering a plea of not guilty to all charges and asserting that he remains Venezuela’s legitimate leader.“I am innocent, I am not guilty,” Maduro told the judge, adding, “I am a decent man.”As he continued speaking in Spanish, he said, “I am still president of my country,” before being cut off by Judge Alvin Hellerstein.“A plea of not guilty will be entered on behalf of Mr Maduro,” Hellerstein said, halting Maduro mid-sentence.Defence attorney Barry Pollack later confirmed that Maduro was entering a plea of not guilty to all four charges.During the hearing, Maduro told the court that he had not yet seen the indictment against him and was unaware of his legal rights.“I did not know of these rights,” he said through an interpreter. “Your honor is informing me of them now,” reported AP.Earlier in the hearing, a court-appointed translator relayed Maduro’s account of his arrest. “I was captured at my home in Caracas, Venezuela,” the translator said on his behalf.Maduro entered the courtroom shortly after 12 pm (local time) wearing prison attire, with his feet shackled and headphones on for translation, reported CBS news.His wife, Cilia Flores, who appeared alongside him, wore similar prison clothing. Both had their hands unshackled. Maduro briefly shook hands with his attorney upon entering the courtroom.After Maduro entered his plea, Judge Hellerstein turned to his wife to confirm her identity. Speaking in Spanish through an interpreter, she said, “I am first lady of the Republic of Venezuela.”When asked to enter a plea, Flores responded, “Not guilty. Completely innocent.”Near the end of the hearing, Maduro’s lawyer said his client “is head of a sovereign state and entitled to the privilege” that such a status confers. Pollack also raised “questions about the legality of his military abduction,” adding that there would be “voluminous” pretrial filings to challenge the case on legal grounds.The proceedings concluded at 12.31 pm (local time) after Flores’s attorney, Mark Donnelly, told the court that his client was suffering from “health and medical issues that will require attention.” Donnelly said Flores, 69, may have sustained a fracture or severe bruising to her ribs and could require a full X-ray examination.Both Maduro and Flores agreed to remain in custody for now, with their lawyers reserving the right to seek bail at a later stage.Maduro is being represented by Pollack, a veteran trial lawyer. Pollack previously represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. He also helped broker the 2024 plea deal under which Assange pleaded guilty to a single felony count related to publishing US military secrets.Further proceedings in the case will be held on March 17.","Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro made his first appearance in a US courtroom on Monday following his capture.

Dehradun Headlines Today — Key Stories You Shouldn’t Miss.







DEHRADUN/ HARIDWAR: Uttarakhand government is contemplating a ban on entry of non-Hindus in the 105 ghats of Haridwar spread across an area of 120 sq km, following the demand raised by a few seers and Ganga Sabha, the body overseeing the maintenance of the main Har-ki-Pauri ghat in Haridwar. Besides, the state also plans to declare Rishikesh and Haridwar as ‘sanatan pavitra shehar' (holy cities).Sources told TOI that the process may be initiated from Ardh Kumbh -- scheduled to commence on the occasion of Makar Sankranti on Jan 14, 2027.They added that the govt has started digging out details of the agreement between Bharat Ratna recipient Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya and the British in 1916. Malviya was the first president of the Ganga Sabha. The 1916 agreement aimed to maintain the uninterrupted flow of the Ganga and preserve the sanctity of the pilgrimage city, which included restrictions on the entry of non-Hindus at Ganga ghats. It further stated that non-Hindus could not have permanent residence in both the religious towns (Rishikesh and Haridwar), and they could only come for work and return after completing their tasks.Sources confirmed that the state govt is ""seriously looking to restore the provisions of the original agreement.""Speaking about the matter, CM Pushkar Singh Dhami said, ""Our govt will take every necessary step to protect the unique spiritual and cultural identity of Devbhoomi. The Himalayan state is the centre of faith for sanatan believers."" He added that ""Haridwar and Rishikesh are major centres of faith"", and consideration is being given to declaring both the places as ""sanatan cities"".Notably, Ganga Sabha president, Nitin Gautam, had earlier said, ""To maintain Haridwar's sanctity, the entire Kumbh Mela and Haridwar city should be declared a non-Hindu free zone, and their entry should be banned. All river banks in Haridwar and Rishikesh should be off limits for them."" On Monday, however, Gautam, told TOI that he made that demand in his capacity as the former president (Haridwar) of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, adding that ""no resolution on this has been adopted by the Ganga Sabha"".While Ganga Sabha general secretary Tanmay Vashishth remained non-committal on the sensitive matter, its ex-president Ashok Tripathi said he was ""not in favour of the demand"". ""By-laws of Haridwar nagar palika do ban non-Hindus' entry into Har-ki-Pauri area, except those on govt duty. But personally, I'm not in favour of any such ban,"" Tripathi said.Meanwhile, several residents of Haridwar raised their objections to the demand. ""It is neither possible, nor desirable to disallow non-Hindus' entry in the entire Kumbh area,"" said Sudhanshu Dwivedi, a legal practitioner. ""Such discrimination will adversely affect the liberal image of our religion,"" added Rakesh Chandra, retired hydel department executive engineer.Political parties also weighed in on the matter. Opposing the ""blanket ban"", Ashok Sharma, ex-municipal councillor of Congress, said, ""Are BJP-RSS bigger Hindus than Madan Mohan Malviya who had sought ban of non-Hindus' entry only in Har-ki-Pauri?""BJP's former district president (Haridwar), Sandeep Goel, said, ""This (demand) is not our party line...""","Uttarakhand government is considering a ban on non-Hindus entering Haridwar's 105 ghats, potentially restoring a 1916 agreement.

When Elon Musk called his father 'Evil'



Past controversies around Errol Musk







Errol Musk, the father of Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reignited a controversy with the latest comments about the projected demographic transformation in the United States. Speaking in a recent interview, Errol Musk warned that America would ‘collapse’ if the white population becomes a minority within the next two decades, calling the shift “a very, very bad thing to happen. ”Musk raised questions about the implications of the demographic change, asking, “You want to see the U.S. go down? Why? You don’t like electric cars, and you don’t like technology? What is it, you want to go back to the jungle?” Along with this, he also spoke about South Africa, claiming that the “small white population that projects the European culture” has contributed significantly to the growth and development of the Black African population. He dismissed the notion of systemic oppression in South Africa as “nonsense.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk has not shared an amicable relationship with his father. In an interview with Rolling Stone a few years ago, Elon Musk characterised his father as someone who “will plan evil”.Elon Musk has frequently expressed his disapproval of his father, who had ties to the apartheid regime of South Africa and has faced multiple criminal accusations.Musk described Errol as “such a terrible human being” and claimed that his father had committed “almost every crime you can possibly think of.” He added, “My dad will have a carefully thought-out plan of evil. He will plan evil. Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done. It’s so terrible, you can’t believe it.”In 1998, Errol Musk admitted that he killed three people insisting that it was an act of self-defence. Initially he was arrested but was later released after the charges were dropped. The incident was dded to the long list of controversies surrounding him which further fulled Elon Musk’s distrust.Elon Musk has repeatedly emphasised that his father’s words cannot be trusted. Reflecting on his attempts to mend their relationship, Musk said, “In my experience, there is nothing you can do. Nothing, nothing. I wish. I’ve tried everything. I tried threats, rewards, intellectual arguments, emotional arguments, everything to try to change my father for the better, and he, no way, it just got worse.”Musk's relationship with his father Errol has long been a topic of public interest. The controversial statements made by Errol in the past still continue to cast a shadow over their family dynamics offering insight into the personal challenges faced by one of the world’s most influential tech entrepreneurs.","Errol Musk, the father of Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reignited a controversy with the latest comments about the projected demographic transformation in the United States.

'Not Aware Of Acts': Thailand Slams Trump Claim Cambodia Conflict As Bangkok Vows Retaliation





Thailand on Tuesday said its Cambodian counterpart claimed that fresh cross-border fire was 'an operational error', following Bangkok’s allegation that Cambodian forces violated a 10-day-old truce.“A military unit in the area was contacted by the Cambodian side who claimed there was no intention to fire into Thai territory and said the incident was caused by an operational error by Cambodian personnel,” the Thai army said in a statement.The statement comes after Thailand earlier accused Cambodia of violating the same ceasefire, alleging that Cambodian forces fired mortars into a Thai border province, wounding one soldier.Thailand’s army said the incident took place on morning in Ubon Ratchathani province, along the disputed border. In a statement, the army said, “Cambodia has violated the ceasefire,” accusing Cambodian forces of firing mortar rounds into Thai territory. It added that one Thai soldier was wounded by shrapnel and was being evacuated for medical treatment.The allegation comes despite a truce agreed on December 27, which was meant to end nearly three weeks of fighting between the two Southeast Asian neighbours.The ceasefire was signed after weeks of intense clashes that included fighter-jet sorties, rocket fire and artillery barrages, marking the worst fighting between the two countries in years.At the time of the agreement, the defence ministers of both countries said they would freeze troop movements along the border. In a joint statement, they said, “Both sides agree to maintain current troop deployments without further movement.”The statement warned that “any reinforcement would heighten tensions and negatively affect long-term efforts to resolve the situation,” according to CNN.The truce was signed by Thai defence minister Natthaphon Narkphanit and his Cambodian counterpart Tea Seiha, ending around 20 days of fighting that killed at least 101 people and displaced more than half a million civilians on both sides.The long-running conflict between Thailand and Cambodia dates back more than a century, with both countries contesting sovereignty at several undemarcated points along their 817-kilometre land border. While the dispute has simmered for decades, it has periodically erupted into violence.Tensions escalated again last year, with clashes in December killing dozens and forcing around one million people to flee their homes across border regions.The latest round of fighting was re-ignited in early December after the collapse of a previous ceasefire that had been brokered with the involvement of US President Donald Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.The agreement had also included humanitarian steps, such as the return of displaced civilians and a pledge that neither side would use force against civilians. Thailand had also agreed to return 18 Cambodian soldiers captured during earlier clashes if the ceasefire held for 72 hours.","Cambodia claims fresh cross-border fire was 'an operational error' Thai army claims Cambodian forces fired mortars into a Thai border province, wounding one soldier.

‘They couldn’t accept calling Hindu man sir’: Family of lynched Bangladeshi factory worker says promotion triggered false blasphemy charge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/they-couldnt-accept-calling-hindu-man-sir-family-of-lynched-bangladeshi-factory-worker-says-promotion-triggered-false-blasphemy-charge/articleshow/126365122.cms,"





DEHRADUN: A fortnight after the lynching of Dipu Chandra Das — a 28-year-old Hindu garment factory worker who was beaten and burnt alive on accusations of blasphemy — in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district, his family has now said that the real trigger was his promotion at work. Speaking to TOI from Bangladesh, they alleged that a few colleagues, unable to accept that a man of another faith, had been promoted over them, manufactured the charge after failing the same in-house exam that Dipu cleared to become 'in-charge'.“They simply raised an objection citing his religion,” said Baburam Das, Dipu’s father-in-law. “They couldn’t accept the fact that they had to call him ‘Sir’ in the factory. On the day of the incident, they entered into a verbal altercation with him over religion. Then they accused him of blasphemy, beat him near the factory gate and handed him over to an incited mob waiting outside to kill him.”Dipu had recently cleared the promotion exam, ahead of several others who took it, and had been elevated from supervisor to in-charge — a designation change that sparked resentment. His family insists the backlash was not about anything he had said or done but rather about what he had achieved, and who he was.“Those raising objections also sat the exam but didn’t pass,” said Baburam. “My son-in-law got the job on merit. They couldn’t tolerate it and ended up committing this inhumane, heinous act. Two families have been devastated.”Dipu’s brother, Apu Chandra Das, also confirmed the family's version, saying he had heard similar accounts from his co-workers. “What we know is that he was falsely accused of blasphemy and murdered,” he said. “He was a calm, friendly person who respected all religions equally. It's devastating that his colleagues, angry over a promotion, chose to take revenge in such a horrific way.”Apu filed a complaint on Dec 19, following which the local police and the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), Bangladesh’s elite counter-terror unit, launched an investigation. Around 20 people have been arrested so far, though the FIR named approximately 150 unidentified individuals as part of the mob. The RAB, in an official statement, said no post or act by Dipu indicating blasphemy had been found on social media — the original accusation made by the attackers.Dipu’s father, Robi Lal Das, told TOI that Bangladesh's govt has extended some support. “We’re receiving Rs 25,000 a month and 5kg of dry ration,” he said. “They’ve also promised a govt job to Dipu’s wife. But now that our son is gone, all we want is justice. He was falsely accused. That is the only truth.”His daughter, now widowed, wears white. Their one-year-old child, Baburam said, keeps looking around for her father. “Her eyes still search for someone who will never return. How do we explain to her what happened? All her happiness has been snatched away. My daughter is left alone to raise a child in mourning,” he said. “I just hope justice is served so that no other Hindu family in this country has to go through what we have. ”","Dipu Chandra Das, a 28-year-old Hindu garment factory worker, was beaten and burnt alive on accusations of blasphemy.

Trump SNUBS NATO Nations Over Greenland ‘INVASION, FEARS’ Putin & Xi | ‘US NEEDS Arctic Island’





Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Monday strongly rejected US President Donald Trump ’s renewed claims about Greenland, the autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.Frederiksen dismissed Trump's repetitive assertions that the US ""needs"" Greenland for ""security reasons"", calling it an ""unacceptable pleasure."" Speaking to a Danish broadcaster, she said, ""Unfortunately, I think the American president should be taken seriously when he says he wants Greenland,"" also mentioning that both Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly ruled out any possibility of the island becoming part of the United States.When asked what it would mean if the US used force against another Nato member, Frederiksen replied, ""If the US attacks another Nato country, everything stops."" She added that while she cannot predict Washington's actions, ""there is full support from Europe that borders must be respected.""In a Sunday interview with The Atlantic, Trump insisted the US ""absolutely"" needs Greenland and discussed American intervention in Venezuela.Reviving his long-running interest in acquiring the island, he argued that it is crucial for US national security. ""We need Greenland. ... It’s so strategic right now. Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,"" he claimed. ""We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.""In response, Frederiksen issued a statement on Sunday saying the US has no right to annex Greenland and urging Washington to stop issuing threats toward a close ally and the people of Greenland.Tensions escalated further after Trump appointed Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as the US special envoy to Greenland last month. Since taking office in January 2025, Trump has repeatedly shown interest in gaining control of the island, saying he would not rule out using “military or economic coercion” to pursue that goal.","Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen strongly rejected US President Donald Trump’s renewed claims about Greenland.

President Trump is eyeing the Arctic territory for its strategic significance amid growing foreign naval presence.





A top White House aide on Monday did not rule out the use of military force if the United States ever decided to take control of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark.Stephen Miller, senior adviser to President Donald Trump, described Greenland as ""a colony of Denmark"" and claimed, ""Nobody is gonna fight the US militarily over the future of Greenland. ""The comments follow calls by Trump for the Arctic island to come under US control. Trump told journalists on Sunday, ""We need Greenland,"" arguing that controlling the island was essential for Washington's ""national security.""The MAGA chief added that the island is surrounded by ""Chinese and Russian ships"" and has previously offered to purchase Greenland. Trump has also not ruled out military action to achieve that aim.The push sparked warnings from Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. She said that a US takeover of Greenland would threaten the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), stating, ""If the United States decides to military attack another NATO country, then everything would stop — that includes NATO and therefore post-World War II security.""Frederiksen warned that such a move could disrupt decades of international cooperation and security agreements.However, Miller said that: ""Greenland should be part of the US. By what right does Denmark assert control over Greenland? The US is the power of NATO.""Greenland’s own premier, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, urged both Denmark and the US to work through proper channels. He told the public, ""The situation is not such that the United States can conquer Greenland. That is not the case. Therefore, we must not panic. We must restore the good cooperation we once had.""He also posted on social media, asking Trump to abandon ""fantasies of annexing Greenland"" and that any discussions must respect international law.Greenland has major strategic and economic value. The island hosts a US military base and is rich in oil, minerals and other resources.Moreover, melting Arctic ice could make Greenland a key location for future shipping routes. Copenhagen has previously expressed willingness to allow more US troops on the island.Trump’s comments on Greenland come shortly after the US operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, which has raised questions about the administration’s approach to international law.","Stephen Miller, senior adviser to President Donald Trump, described Greenland as ""a colony of Denmark"" Miller claimed, ""Nobody is gonna fight the US militarily over the future of Greenland"" The comments follow calls by Trump for the Arctic island to come under US control.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126364133,imgsize-24242,width-400,resizemode-4/126364133.jpg"

Nothing to see here except me being attacked. ”Cooke is an Indian-born lawyer, Republican consultant and conservative commentator who has been vocal about alleged Medicaid fraud in Ohio.The video shows Cooke and a companion approaching a home health care office to ask questions about services. Staff initially refused to respond, and the encounter escalated when a group of men confronted the investigators.“What are you guys doing here?” one man asked.Cooke replied, “I’m asking about Home Health Care Services.”The men then accused her of spreading false information about the Somali community. One said, “You are from India. You aren’t a white person,” and added, “Because your last name is Cooke doesn’t mean that you’re white. You’re from India and you just spread a lot of BS.”Cooke repeatedly denied the accusations, saying, “We aren’t coming here to harass anyone,” and ensured that she was asking questions about fraud and not targeting any community.“We actually talked to the agency and then also talked about home health care,” she said, while pointing out that there are 34 home health care businesses in the building and that her team had visited each one.The video shows the confrontation continuing with overlapping arguments. Cooke tried calm down the situation and said: “We are peacefully here,” and encouraged the men to watch her previous videos, which she said showed respectful interactions with members of the Somali community.Eventually, Cooke and her companion left the scene without things getting worse.Later, Cooke said, replying to her own post: ""What kind of business responds to questions about their services with intimidation?""","Mehek Cooke is an Indian-born lawyer, Republican consultant and conservative commentator.

'NO OIL, GOLD FOR US': Maduro’s Deputy Delcy Rodríguez TRASHES Trump’s Solution To Run Venezuela

Who is

Delcy Rodriguez

Delcy Rodriguez is Venezuela’s executive vice president and was directed by the Supreme Court to serve as interim president after Nicolas Maduro was captured during the US military operation.

She is a trained lawyer from Caracas and studied law at the Central University of Venezuela.

Rodriguez has been a senior figure in the chavismo political movement for more than two decades and is regarded as one of Maduro’s closest and most trusted political allies.

She has held several powerful roles in government, including serving as Venezuela’s foreign minister.

Before assuming the interim role, she was also in charge of key economic portfolios, overseeing finance and the country’s oil sector.

She is the sister of Jorge Rodriguez, the president of Venezuela’s National Assembly, and together they have been central figures in the government since the era of former president Hugo Chavez.





Venezuela’s entered a new and uncertain phase on Saturday after President Nicolas Maduro was captured during a US military operation. With no immediate political transition announced, the country’s Supreme Court stepped in, ordering Vice President Delcy Rodriguez to assume the role of interim president, in line with constitutional provisions dealing with a president’s absence.Rodriguez took charge hours after Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were detained. She chaired a meeting of the National Defence Council the same day, appearing alongside senior ministers and military officials.In the meeting, she demanded the immediate release of Maduro and Flores and strongly condemned the US operation. In a televised address, Rodriguez said the early-morning strike violated international law and Venezuela’s sovereignty. She alsocalled on Venezuelans to remain united and urged governments across Latin America to reject what she described as the use of force against a sovereign nation.Rodriguez also insisted that Maduro remains Venezuela’s legitimate president, despite his capture. “There is only one president in this country, and his name is Nicolas Maduro,” she said during the council meeting broadcast on state television.Trump told reporters following Mudaro's capture that Rodriguez was willing to cooperate with Washington. He said she had spoken at length with Rubio and had shown readiness to do “whatever” the US needed.""I think she was quite gracious,"" Trump added. ""We can't take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn't have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind.""",Rodriguez is Venezuela’s executive vice president and was directed by the Supreme Court to serve as interim president.

At least seven loud explosions were heard across Venezuela’s capital, Caracas (early Saturday), with air sirens and low-flying aircraft adding to the alarm. Several neighborhoods reported panic on the streets and power outages following the blasts.According to AFP, the blasts were heard around 2.00 am local time (0600 GMT). The first explosion was recorded shortly before 1.50 am.“One was so strong, my window was shaking after it,” CNN correspondent Osmary Hernández said.Witnesses reported hearing aircraft overhead following the explosions. Smoke was also visible in the southern part of the city near a major military base, according to Reuters. Videos of the explosions quickly surfaced on social media.President Donald Trump confirmed that US had ordered strikes on sites inside Venezuela, including military facilities. Trump also said that Venezuela's president Nicolás Maduro has been captures along with his wife and flown out of the country.The strikes follow months of American military buildup in the region, including the deployment of the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier and several other warships in the Caribbean.The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has banned American commercial flights from operating in Venezuelan airspace, citing concerns over “ongoing military activity,” shortly before a series of explosions were reported in the capital, news agency AP reported.Several areas of Caracas were left without electricity and residents in multiple neighborhoods rushed out onto the streets.Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro, earlier declared a national emergency after a series of explosions rocked the capital Caracas. The government accused the United States of carrying out “military aggression” against civilian and military installations across multiple states. The government further for 'mobilization' of the population after US 'attack', news agency AFP reported.In a government statement, Venezuelan authorities said the US had attacked strategic sites in several parts of the country.The incident comes amid heightened regional tensions, as US President Donald Trump has recently deployed a naval task force to the Caribbean and raised the possibility of ground strikes against Venezuela. In recent days, the US military has also been targeting alleged drug-smuggling boats in the region.The US Embassy in Bogotá has issued travel advisory urging US citizens not to travel to Venezuela. In its warning issued, the embassy said Americans currently in Venezuela should shelter in place and leave the country as soon as it is safe to do so.The embassy reminded citizens that Venezuela is under a Level 4 “Do Not Travel” advisory, the highest warning level, citing severe risks including wrongful detention, torture in detention, terrorism, kidnapping, crime, civil unrest and poor health infrastructure.The US Department of State withdrew all diplomatic personnel from its embassy in Caracas in March 2019 and suspended operations. As a result, all consular services, including emergency assistance, remain unavailable and the US government has no ability to provide help to American citizens inside Venezuela.The advisory also urged US citizens to establish multiple ways of communicating with family and friends outside Venezuela and to closely monitor developments as the situation unfolds.Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Saturday posted an official statement from the Venezuelan government, in which Caracas accused the United States of carrying out a serious military attack on Venezuelan territory.“The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela rejects, repudiates, and denounces before the international community the extremely serious military aggression perpetrated by the current Government of the United States of America against Venezuelan territory and population,” the statement read.The statement claimed the alleged attack violated the United Nations Charter, citing Articles 1 and 2 on respect for sovereignty and the prohibition of the use of force, and warned that such actions “threaten international peace and stability, specifically in Latin America and the Caribbean, and put the lives of millions of people at grave risk.”According to the statement shared by Petro, the Venezuelan government said the objective of the alleged attack was “to seize Venezuela’s strategic resources, particularly its oil and minerals” and to undermine the country’s political independence. “They will not succeed,” the statement added.Earlier, Maduro had claimed that he was open to negotiating with the United States on issues including drug trafficking, oil and migration. Speaking in a pre-recorded interview aired on Venezuelan state television on Thursday, Maduro said he was ready for dialogue with Washington “wherever they want and whenever they want.”However, Maduro also accused the US of using its months-long pressure campaign as a way to force a change in government and gain access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves.He strongly rejected allegations that his administration is linked to drug cartels, calling the US “war on drugs” a pretext for intervention. Asked directly about President Trump’s claim that American forces had struck a docking facility in Venezuela, Maduro declined to confirm or deny the report, saying it was “something we could talk about in a few days.”On Monday, Trump said the United States had carried out a strike on a “dock area” in Venezuela used by boats allegedly involved in drug trafficking, describing it as a “major explosion.” According to CNN, the blast was caused by a drone strike carried out by the CIA.""There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs. We hit all the boats, and now we hit the area... it's the implementation area,"" Trump said.The remarks came as the US military has intensified operations against suspected drug-smuggling vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.Since September, American forces have carried out more than 30 strikes on boats they say were involved in narcotics trafficking, resulting in over 110 deaths, according to US officials. The latest attack, reported earlier this week, killed five people aboard two boats, the US military said.Trump has repeatedly accused Maduro of flooding the US with drugs and migrants, claims the Venezuelan leader strongly denies. He has also doubled the reward for information leading to Maduro’s capture and threatened to designate his government as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation.","At least seven loud explosions heard across Venezuela’s capital, Caracas (early Saturday), with air sirens and low-flying aircraft adding to the alarm.

$400,000 in a matter of hours

Was it an inside job?





A single anonymous trader made a fortune betting that Nicolás Maduro would be removed from power in Venezuela, earning over $400,000 in a matter of hours.The big profit on Polymarket, a crypto-based betting site, has raised questions about whether someone knew in advance about the secret US operation that captured the Latin American leader straight from his habitat.The trader created an account last month and began placing bets on December 27, investing $96 in contracts that would pay out if US invaded Venezuela by January 31, according to the Wall Street Journal.Next week, the person slowly but steadily increased their wagers and focused on contracts predicting Maduro’s removal by the same date.Polymarket data shows the final bet was placed at 9:58 pm ET on Friday, just hours before President Donald Trump started the mission.At the time, the contracts were priced at only 8 cents each, implying just an 8 per cent chance of success.When news of the US action came out, the contracts surged by a huge margin and left the trader with nearly $410,000 in profit from around $34,000 in wagers. More than half of the total bets were made the night before the operation. The account uses a default blockchain address as its screen name.“It’s more likely than not that this was an insider. That’s a lot of money to put in at that price, without a lot of news,” said Tre Upshaw, founder of Polysights, which provides analytics tools for Polymarket users.The Trump administration reportedly kept the operation secret within a small circle of advisers. It involved coordination across multiple military branches, with 150 warplanes deployed from 20 locations.Democratic leader Ritchie Torres said he plans to introduce a law to stop government officials from betting on prediction markets when they have private information. Polymarket officially blocks Americans, but many users get around the rules using virtual private networks.Polymarket founder Shayne Coplan said self-regulation is pretty relevant now on the platform and users are actively flagging suspicious bets in real time.Coplan said the plan was not carried out in secrecy as it's not possible: “The moment there is a suspected insider, it’s pointed out on X, and it’s visible on Polymarket immediately. So it’s not like it’s done in darkness.""","Trader placed $96 in contracts that would pay out if US invaded Venezuela by January 31.
