"Quad ministers set to meet soon, clear decks for summit India will host",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/quad-ministers-set-to-meet-soon-clear-decks-for-summit-india-will-host/articleshow/121606215.cms,"Quad foreign ministers are likely to meet soon in Washington as India gears up to host the summit later this year. It’s learnt that discussions are underway to have the meeting of the informal strategic group involving Australia, India, Japan either in late June or early July, depending upon the availability of the ministers.The meeting of the foreign policy chiefs, if it happens, will lay the ground for the summit that will see US President Donald Trump, Japanese PM Shigeru Ishiba and his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese travelling to India. With the US keen on hosting it, the meeting will again underscore the Trump administration’s unwavering commitment to the group Trump helped revive during his first term - and which has evolved rapidly to work towards a free, open, inclusive, prosperous and resilient Indo-Pacific – in the middle of Washington’s efforts to improve trade ties with China.The Trump administration’s diplomatic engagements in fact kicked off with a meeting of the Quad foreign ministers on January 21 this year, a day after the president was sworn in for the second time. Quad has remained ring-fenced from differences that partners have had with the US over trade and tariff issues and, in the case of India, the unease here over some of the claims made by the US about its role in the India-Pakistan military clash last month.The meeting will also provide an opportunity for external affairs minister S Jaishankar to review India-US cooperation with his counterpart Marco Rubio in a bilateral meeting, including the ongoing efforts for a bilateral trade agreement.While Russia and China continue to see Quad as an exercise in containment, India believes the grouping’s agenda is constructive and practical, focused as it is on infrastructure, debt sustainability, healthcare, critical and emerging technologies, UN reforms, climate change and humanitarian assistance. And that focus will remain unchanged even as India’s ties with China improve considerably.Counterterrorism is also an important focus area for Quad and a strong condemnation of the Pahalgam terrorist attack can be expected from the meeting. In the past, Quad leaders have condemned the Mumbai and Pathankot terrorist attacks and also called upon all States to uphold international standards on anti-money laundering and combating terror-financing, in line with FATF recommendations.While the date for the Quad summit has not been finalized yet, it will probably take place within months of the scheduled meeting of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) leaders in China in late August or early September. PM Narendra Modi has neither accepted nor rejected the invitation for the SCO summit but it’s unlikely that the event will not see participation at any level by India as working concurrently with these groups allows it to amplify its strategic autonomy. In addition to that, India is also hoping to host Russian President Vladimir Putin for the annual summit this year.","The meeting of the foreign policy chiefs, if it happens, will lay the ground for the summit that will see US President Donald Trump, Japanese PM Shigeru Ishiba and his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese travelling to India.

Every country except Turkey called India after Pahalgam terror attack: BJP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/every-country-except-turkey-called-india-after-pahalgam-terror-attack-bjp/articleshow/121605873.cms,"TOI correspondent from London: After the Pahalgam terror attack perpetrated by Pakistan, “except Türkiye, the entire whole called to convey their solidarity, including China”, BJP MP Ravi Shankar Prasad told a press briefing in London on Tuesday.Prasad is leading the Operation Sindoor parliamentary delegation to Europe to communicate India’s concerns about terrorist infrastructure and activity emanating from Pakistan.“The nuclear bluff of Pakistan has been called out; as far as India's nuclear strategy is concerned, we are very clear: no first use. We are a responsible, democratic country and a responsible nuclear power and we have conveyed that to everyone, but if Pakistan undertook an adventure of nuclear size, we are capable of responding,” said Prasad.In London the delegation met ministers, political party leaders, parliamentarians and think tanks. “We acquainted them with the entire terror infrastructure of Pakistan, where the distinction between the military leadershipand terror network is no more in existence and the terrorists do the bidding of the army, and the audience was very appreciative.Pakistan should be made to pay costs. It has taken a loan 25 times from the IMF.There needs to be accountability on where the money is going. India as a sovereign country has the right to save its citizens from terrorism,” he said, ahead of the delegation heading to Brussels.He said 75 years after Independence, India was now the fourth-biggest economy in the world and India’s digital services “were something the world was talking about”. In Pakistan, meanwhile, “unelected generals controlled power”.“Terrorism is a tool of state policy in Pakistan,” he said, adding “we are not against the people of Pakistan. They are fed up with the generals.”PM Narendra Modi went to the wedding of former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif’s granddaughter’s and in response “got Pulwama, Uri, Pahalgam,” he said.“Osama bin Laden was ultimately captured in Pakistan. A journalist’s throat was slit and the one who killed him has been killed by India’s precise strike on terror camps.”He said Op Sindoor was only “paused” — not stopped — “subject to the good behaviour of Pakistan.” “We believe in peace. We don’t permit a situation where innocent Indians are killed with impunity by terrorists. This is not acceptable.”A BBC journalist asked what evidence India had that the Pahalgam attack was directly linked to Pakistan or its govt.He responded that a proxy of the Pakistan-based terror group LeT, The Resistance Front, had claimed responsibility for Pahalgam. He pointed out that Pakistan army generals and police officers were present at the funeral of a terrorist killed in Op Sindoor and a wreath was sent by the Pakistan Chief of Army Staff. “This is not the first terrorist attack emanating from Pakistan on India. You cannot ignore this disturbing record of terrorism in Pakistan. People involved with the Mumbai terror attacks are in safe houses in Lahore, 52 terrorists have been designatedby the UN in Pakistan. Terror camps are there within Pakistan yet there are none in India and none in the UK,” he said.On Chinasupplying weapons to Pakistan, he said: “India also has a relationship with China. We have a dialogue with them (China), but where you give Pakistan weapons and they are being used for terrorism, for killing people, not in a conventional war, these are important issues and I'm quite sure China will understand ultimately, all the investment and projects in Pakistan are also getting disturbed because of this extremism, radicalisation and terrorism. ”","Prasad is leading the Operation Sindoor parliamentary delegation to Europe to communicate India’s concerns about terrorist infrastructure and activity emanating from Pakistan. “The nuclear bluff of Pakistan has been called out; as far as India's nuclear strategy is concerned, we are very clear: no first use,” said Prasad.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121605921,imgsize-820619,width-400,resizemode-4/121605921.jpg"

SRINAGAR: Farooq Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti and J&K LG Manoj Sinha joined hundreds of Kashmiri Pandits Tuesday at Mela Kheer Bhawani, an annual fair at an eponymous shrine in Ganderbal’s Tulmulla, marking the largest gathering since the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack and raising hopes of the displaced community’s return to the Valley.LG Sinha interacted with people and extended warm greetings on the occasion. The shrine is known as Kheer Bhawani as devotees offer milk and(milk pudding) to a sacred spring there which, the legend has it, changes colour. Pandits from across the country travel to the temple fair, around 35km from Srinagar, each year.“Devotees in large numbers is a good sign. I think after the heinous (Pahalgam) terror attack on April 22, it is the first time that people in such large numbers have assembled at one place in Kashmir. May Mata Kheer Bhawani keep showering her blessings on J&K people,” Sinha said, vowing to make the pilgrimage safe and hassle-free.Sinha also announced that preparations were in full swing for the annual Amarnath Yatra this year from July 3 to Aug 9. “We have made all arrangements for the security of yatris. I request pilgrims from across the country to come for the yatra,” Sinha said.PDP president Mehbooba cited the large Pandit throngs at Kheer Bhawani temple to reiterate her belief that guns were not the solution to Kashmir’s issues.“Kashmir issue cannot be resolved through military force or militants’ guns. Political solution is the only way forward. There should be a political process. That process cannot be completed until our Kashmiri Pandit brothers and sisters return with due respect and settle in the Valley,” Mehbooba said.Farooq, president of J&K’s governing National Conference (NC), echoed the views as he was greeted warmly at the fair. He stressed the “urgent” need for return and resettlement of Pandits in the Valley, calling for land as well as proper housing facilities. He recalled that NC had during its past stints in office attempted such rehabilitation and expressed hope the situation would improve enough for Pandits to live in Kashmir as they once did.Kheer Bhawani temple was built by then monarch Pratap Singh in 1912. The spring there has held religious sanctity for Pandits over centuries, with many claiming its origin to Lord Rama’s times.","Hundreds of Kashmiri Pandits gather at Mela Kheer Bhawani, an annual fair at an eponymous shrine in Ganderbal’s Tulmulla.

TMC assault on BJP backers attack on democracy: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tmc-assault-on-bjp-backers-attack-on-democracy-sc/articleshow/121607037.cms,"'Cancellation of bail requires a higher threshold than grant of bail'

NEW DELHI: Coming down heavily on Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers for targeting Hindu families and their women for supporting BJP during the 2021 assembly elections in alleged complicity with West Bengal police, Supreme Court has cancelled the bail granted to six TMC workers and said such incidents were ""grave attacks on the roots of democracy"".It allowed an appeal against Calcutta HC's orders granting bail to Sekh Jamir Hossain, Sekh Nurai, Sekh Ashraf, Sekh Karibul and Jayanta Done.A Supreme Court bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said, ""The concerted attack on the (Hindu) complainant's house was launched on the day of election results with the sole objective of wreaking vengeance because he had supported the saffron party. ""This is a grave circumstance which convinces us that the accused persons, including the respondents herein, were trying to terrorise members of the opposite political party whom the accused respondents were supporting. ""Aware that cancellation of bail requires a higher threshold than grant of bail, the bench said, ""Having regard to the facts enumerated above, we feel that the present one is a case wherein the allegations against the accused respondents are so grave that the same shake the conscience of the court.""Writing the judgment, Justice Mehta said, ""The reprehensible way the incident was perpetrated shows the vengeful attitude of the accused persons and their avowed objective to subdue supporters of the opposite party into submission by hook or by crook. The dastardly offence was nothing short of a grave attack on the roots of democracy.""The judgment recorded that the complainant's wife was viciously pulled by the hair and disrobed. The accused persons were about to assault her sexually when the woman gathered the courage to pour kerosene on herself and threatened self-immolation upon which the accused persons ran away, it said.Justices Nath and Mehta said, ""There is no possibility of a fair and impartial trial being conducted if the accused respondents are allowed to remain on bail. Thus, on both counts - nature and gravity of the offence which is nothing short of an attack on the roots of democracy, and the imminent likelihood of the accused adversely affecting a fair trial - the bail granted to the accused respondents must be cancelled.""This was the second time in recent days that attacks on Hindus by TMC members had the judiciary's attention and intervention. Earlier, a fact-finding team set up by Calcutta HC held that a party MLA and a corporator had identified houses of Hindus which were later targeted by a violent mob protesting against the new waqf law in Murshidabad. Two people were killed in the attack.Asking the trial court to conclude the trial within six months, SC directed the West Bengal home secretary and the director general of police to ensure that proper protection was provided to the complainant and all witnesses so that they could freely appear and depose at the trial. The SC warned that if any violation of these directions was reported by the CBI, it would take suitable action. Immediately after the 2021 assembly elections, in the Muslim majority village of Gumsima, TMC workers wreaked vengeance on a Hindu family for supporting BJP. The head of the family had earlier lodged a police complaint that he was not being allowed to carry out his religious rituals.The evening after election results were declared on May 2, 2021, an armed mob of 40-50 people led by Sekh Mahim threw bombs at the Hindu family's house, looted belongings and disrobed the complainant's wife and molested her. The mob relented only when she poured kerosene on herself and threatened self-immolation. The entire family fled the village to save their lives and dignity.On May 3, 2021, the family approached Sadaipur police station to lodge a complaint. The officer-in-charge did not accept the complaint and advised the complainant to leave the village to save himself and his family. Several similar complaints were not recorded by the police. Calcutta HC on Aug 19, 2021, ordered CBI to investigate all such cases involving rape, murder or attempt to commit such offences. CBI had registered cases in Dec 2021.","Supreme Court has cancelled the bail granted to six TMC workers. Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said the allegations against the accused respondents are so grave that the same shake the conscience of the court. Calcutta HC had ordered CBI to investigate all such cases involving rape, murder or attempt to commit such offences in registered cases.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121607044,imgsize-1701149,width-400,resizemode-4/121607044.jpg"

He noted that the complaints were ""nothing but a bundle of lies full of fabricated and malicious unsubstantiated allegations levelled by the complainant (woman).""SC was also informed that the woman had filed a similar complaint in 2021 against a professor at Osmania University, where she was studying.What proved crucial in the current case were the woman's social media chats, where she went by the name 'Muffin'.

She also said she would irritate her victims to the extent that they dump her, so she could happily start with the next one,"" the bench noted.The court said the chats revealed a consistent pattern that supported the man's claim of being falsely implicated, and quashed the criminal proceedings against him.","Supreme Court quashes rape charges against a man who had a consensual physical relationship with a 30-year-old woman.

JIND: The district administration along with a NGO stopped three stopped three marriages in a month, in which all three couples were minors.In a fresh case, the district administration successfully intervened a child marriage at the local Vishwakarma Chowk area in Jind in which the bride and groom both were minors.

This is the third child marriage prevented in a month in the Jind district.The first child marriage was stopped at Brahmanwas village on April 30, in which the groom’s age was 20 and bride was 17. In this case, the boy had been selected in a government job in postal department, and the bride’s father was poor, and following his financial condition, he fixed the marriage of his younger girl along with his elder daughter on the same day to save marriage expenses. The second marriage was prevented at Kharak Gadia village of this district on May 12, in which the groom’s age was 18 and the bride was 13, said officials.In the fresh case, it came to light that preparations were underway and the groom’s procession was ready to proceed to complete further marriage rituals at the bride’s house at Narnaund town of Hisar district. The team members apprised the groom’s mother, a widow, and guests of the strict provisions of the Child Marriage Act 2006.For some time, she tried to mislead in showing birth certificates of her son, but after strict warning from the team members, she produced the certificates in which it came to light that the he was 3 years shorter than marriageable age. After this, the birth certificates of the brides were also demanded on WhatsApp, and after verifying the documents, the bride was also found to be just 16 years old.Later, the groom's mother recorded her statement before the police that she was illiterate and unaware of the provisions of The Child Marriage Act 2006, said Surender Singh Mann, head of MDD, an NGO which was involved with district administration in all three marriages.Maan said that under the aegis of Just Rights for Children (JRC), a national platform of 250 civil societies working in 416 districts in the country, his organization was working against child marriage in 14 districts of Haryana , including Jind. He further said though different social reasons forced parents to tie the knot of their minor children but independent choices of brides and grooms totally ignored, as parents treat them as their private property, which is an injustice to them.","In a fresh case, the district administration successfully intervened a child marriage at the local Vishwakarma Chowk area in Jind. The boy was 18 years old while the girl was 16-years old. This is the third child marriage prevented in a month in the Jind district.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121603223,imgsize-1262975,width-400,resizemode-4/121603223.jpg"

How LeBron James and Brian Windhorst first crossed paths

What sparked the recent tension between LeBron and Windhorst?

The latest escalation in their feud





andhave a complicated history, and their recent public exchanges have brought their strained relationship into the spotlight. The Lakers star has taken shots at the ESPN reporter, calling him ""weird"" and dismissing his claims about their past connection. Here’s what’s behind their feud and why it’s heating up now. LeBron James and Brian Windhorst go way back—all the way to LeBron’s high school days in Akron, Ohio. Windhorst covered local sports for the *Akron Beacon Journal*, where he first reported on the future NBA superstar. Both attended St. Vincent-St. Mary’s High School and grew up on the west side of Akron. Their connection even extended to Windhorst’s mother, who taught sex education to both of them.For years, Brian Windhorst was one of the few reporters with close access to LeBron James. He was reportedly the only journalist allowed to speak with LeBron when his then-girlfriend was about to give birth to their son, Bronny. But as James’ fame grew, their relationship shifted, with the natural divide between athlete and reporter becoming more pronounced.The feud became public when LeBron James appeared on The Pat McAfee Show and took aim at Windhorst. He mocked the reporter’s claims of being close to him and criticized his analysis of James’ Nike deal, which Windhorst suggested was influenced by Michael Jordan “I see Brian Windhorst on one of these shows not too long ago. The guy who says he’s like my (expletive) best friend,” James said. “These guys… it’s weird.”Windhorst responded by clarifying their relationship, stating, “LeBron doesn’t owe me anything, I owe him a lot. Just know, I met LeBron 25 years ago. And my understanding of LeBron and where people stand in his life has been crystal clear.” (H/t Sporting News)The conflict took another turn when James’ podcast, *Mind the Game*, used a clip of Windhorst from *First Take* in a promotional video. The clip appeared to show Windhorst dismissing the idea of a basketball show focused on X’s and O’s, though the context wasn’t entirely clear. James reposted the edited clip, adding fuel to the fire.Also read: Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry surprises son Canon Curry with Mr. Beast video call in heartwarming moment With both men entrenched in their positions, the back-and-forth shows no signs of stopping. Windhorst continues covering the NBA, while LeBron James remains one of the league’s most outspoken stars. Whether this feud fades or escalates further remains to be seen, but for now, it’s one of the more unusual conflicts in sports media.","Lakers star LeBron James and ESPN reporter Brian Windhorst have been feuding for months.

A manhunt is underway in central Washington for 32-year-old Travis Decker, who is accused of murdering his three daughters and leaving their bodies near a campground in Leavenworth.The girls, Paityn Decker, 9; Evelyn Decker, 8; and Olivia Decker, 5, were found with plastic bags over their heads, according to authorities. They were last seen shortly after 5.30 pm on Friday during a planned visit with their father Travis.Their mother became concerned when Decker failed to return them and stopped responding to her messages, something police say was unusual behavior for him.“Last night at 8 pm Travis was supposed to drop the girls back off with me and never showed,” their mother, Whitney, wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday. “The cops have him going north out of Wenatchee at 5.41.”Decker, who is now wanted on three counts of murder and kidnapping, is a former Army soldier with “extensive training” and may be dangerous. Police have urged the public not to approach him. He is believed to be homeless and living out of his white 2017 GMC Sierra pickup truck, or staying in motels and campgrounds in the area.On Monday, the authorities found Decker’s unoccupied truck near a campground after searching throughout the weekend.During a search of the surrounding area, officers discovered the bodies of the three girls.The Chelan county sheriff’s office is leading the search in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, while other agencies continue to follow up on leads.According to an affidavit, Whitney Decker told police she was concerned for the girls' safety, citing that Travis was “currently experiencing some mental health issues.” She also said he had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and was not taking his medication.On Friday, the Wenatchee police department requested an AMBER Alert, but the Washington State Patrol denied the request, stating there was not enough evidence to suggest the children were in immediate danger.“We just didn’t have that,” said Chris Loftis, a spokesman for the Washington state patrol. “Everyone wishes we could turn back the clock.”","Travis Decker, 32, is accused of murdering his three daughters and leaving their bodies near a campground in Leavenworth, Washington.

‘Will Disappear Within…’: Putin Aide’s Chilling Warning To Zelensky; Russia’s Revenge Announcement





Ukraine’s security service has claimed responsibility for an underwater explosion that damaged Russia’s key bridge linking to Crimea.According to a statement released on Tuesday, Ukraine’s SBU said it used 1,100 kilograms (2,420 pounds) of explosives to target the road and rail bridge early in the morning. The blast reportedly struck the underwater pillars of the 19-kilometre Crimea Bridge over the Kerch Strait, a vital military and civilian link between Russia and the peninsula it annexed from Ukraine in 2014.“Previously, we hit the Crimean Bridge twice, in 2022 and 2023. So today we continued this tradition underwater,” said the SBU, adding that the operation had been in planning for several months.Footage released by the SBU showed an explosion near one of the bridge’s support columns. Reuters confirmed the location using visual elements of the bridge matched against satellite and file images, but could not independently verify when the video was recorded.The official Russian outlet responsible for providing status updates on the bridge said that its operation was suspended between 4 am. and 7 am local time. No official reason was given for the three-hour closure, although it confirmed that the bridge had reopened and was functioning normally.The Crimea Bridge has served as a critical supply line for Russian troops since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Russian forces initially crossed into Crimea using the bridge before advancing into the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of southern Ukraine.The bridge was one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s flagship projects, consisting of parallel road and rail sections supported by concrete stilts and iconic steel arches at the navigational span between the Black Sea and the Azov Sea.Although the SBU claimed damage to the structure, Russian military bloggers suggested the attempt may have failed and speculated that a sea drone might have been used in the operation.This incident follows another Ukrainian operation on Sunday, when drones targeted Russian long-range bomber planes at airfields across Russia. That attack was reportedly codenamed “Spider’s Web.”",Ukraine’s security service claims responsibility for underwater explosion that damaged bridge linking to Crimea.

Sana Yousaf: Another TikTok star killed as Pakistan struggles with ‘honour’-based violence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/another-tiktok-star-killed-as-pakistan-struggles-with-honour-based-violence/articleshow/121605818.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: The vibrant life of 17-year-old TikTok star Sana Yousaf was cut short on Monday evening when she was shot dead in her Islamabad home in what police suspect may be yet another killing in the name of “honour”.The incident, which sent shockwaves through Pakistan’s digital and social spheres, underscores the persistent dangers faced by young women who dare to express themselves in a society grappling with deeply entrenched patriarchal norms.Sana, a rising social media influencer from Chitral, a breathtaking mountainous region in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, had captivated nearly 800,000 TikTok followers and 500,000 on Instagram with her vibrant content celebrating Chitrali culture, women’s rights, and educational awareness.According to the FIR filed by Sana’s mother, Farzana Yousaf, a man armed with a pistol entered their home in Islamabad’s G-13 sector at around 5 pm on Monday. Without warning, he fired two shots directly into Sana’s chest, killing her instantly. Police said the suspect has been arrested and the murder weapon and Sana’s iPhone recovered from him. Hayat, a 22- or 23-year-old fellow TikToker and acquaintance of Sana, has confessed to the crime, though his motives remain under investigation, police said.Islamabad police said they are exploring multiple angles, including the possibility of an “honour killing” — a crime rooted in the warped perception that a woman’s actions, particularly those challenging traditional gender roles, bring “dishonour” to her family.Sana’s killing is not an isolated incident but part of a disturbing pattern of violence against young women in Pakistan, particularly those who leverage social media to amplify their voices. In Jan this year a 15-year-old girl named Hira was shot dead in Quetta by her father, Anwarul-Haq, in an alleged “honour killing”. Hira’s crime? Refusing to abandon her TikTok presence despite her father’s disapproval of her “dressing, lifestyle, and social gathering”. Having lived in the US for years, Anwarul-Haq returned to Pakistan with Hira only to orchestrate her murder in a premeditated act to which he later confessed.In 2016, social media star Qandeel Baloch was strangled by her brother in a high-profile killing, her bold online presence deemed a stain on “family honour”. More recently, a female TikToker in Pakistan Punjab’s Khushab was killed by her cousin, and another was found dead in Peshawar, highlighting a chilling trend of violence targeting young women who embrace digital platforms.","17-year-old TikTok star Sana Yousaf was shot dead in her Islamabad home.

Noida Protest: Cattle in Noida condo as protest over stray dogs takes a unique turn,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/cattle-in-noida-condo-as-protest-over-stray-dogs-takes-a-unique-turn/articleshow/121606014.cms,"



Noida: Humour met resolve at Ecovillage 2 in Greater Noida West this week when a group of residents decided to expand their protest against feeding of stray dogs by shepherding cattle into the society.Their logic? If dog lovers could feed canines freely, cows, buffaloes, goats and other four-legged friends should also receive their ""fair share of hospitality"", they reasoned. While the move amused most, it also highlighted the simmering tension among residents over feeding of animals.On Sunday morning, around a dozen residents began feeding stray cattle and also brought some of them into the Ecovillage compound. To build up on the idea, a cattle shed with fodder, bananas for monkeys and hiring shepherds to introduce goats and sheep into the gated condominium are also on the cards.According to the residents, improper feeding habits have led more than a dozen stray dogs to loiter around in the society. This, they said, had given rise to increasing cases of dog bites, prompting questions on why some animals received special attention.A recent post on X by Mahender Mahi spotlighted such growing efforts, including the plan for a gaushalas. While some users saw this as a ""tit-for-tat"" strategy, others raised concern over such disagreements.""We have been troubled by the issue of stray dogs for long. Despite multiple complaints to the maintenance team and sharing videos of dog behaviour with them, nothing concrete has been done. So, this is our way of a symbolic protest — a cattle shed. If stray dogs can roam around the complex, why not cows, buffaloes, and other animals,"" Rajkumar, a resident, sought to know.Rajkumar insisted that their actions had been peaceful. ""The most common excuse given to feed stray dogs is that they are voiceless and need to be looked after. But, so are cows, monkeys and goats,"" he added.According to Rajkumar, although Ecovillage has designated feeding points for these strays, dog lovers leave food anywhere in the society, resulting in a mess.The protesters are now planning to install a trough in front of Tower C-4 with green fodder for cattle.""Soon, we will keep food like bananas and water for monkeys, and pay local shepherds to bring in their goats and sheep to roam inside our society. Why should they be left behind?""While some dog lovers insisted they would continue feeding the strays the way they did earlier, others backed the decision to help more animals in distress.""Not everything can be done according to the mood. Laws and rules are also important. People can do whatever they want. I will not let the dogs go out,"" said one of them.Another dog lover, Vaibhav, said, ""Even the dog lovers will be happy that others in the society are learning from them and feeding the strays.""A more conciliatory stance came from Prabhat Dutt, a resident. ""This is a good thing. Dog lovers will not have any problem with the move. We will also serve the cows, monkeys or goats along with serving the dogs,"" Dutt said.Mohd Azeem, the maintenance manager at Ecovillage 2, described the protest as a ""one-off event"".""We have discussed the matter with both dog lovers and those protesting the feeding of strays inside the society. They took a mutual decision to follow all rules related to stray dogs and other animals,"" he added.",Residents at Ecovillage 2 in Greater Noida West began feeding stray cattle and also brought some of them into the compound.

AMRITSAR: Sikhs who deserted the Indian Army in 1984 over Operation Bluestar have accused the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) of not giving them appropriate recognition.Samuh Sikh Dharmi Fauji June 1984 Parivar Welfare Association has announced to launch a movement on June 6 to press the SGPC to acknowledge their contributions and grant them the honour they believe is due to them.In local parlance, Sikhs who deserted the army over Bluestar are called ""dharmi fauji"".Association president Baldev Singh said SGPC had failed to support them. He said while SGPC claims the number of dharmi faujis is 309, the actual number is 2,875.Baldev, who was serving as a havildar in the Indian Army and was posted in Mizoram at the time, left his barracks in June 1984. He said SGPC only provided compensation of Rs 50,000 to families of dharmi faujis who served jail terms, and Rs 1 lakh to the families of those who died.Baldev said during Operation Bluestar, launched to flush out militants holed up in gurdwaras, Sikh soldiers from various states across India, including Punjab, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar, deserted their barracks and marched toward Amritsar to protect the Golden Temple, the Akal Takht, and other gurdwaras. ""Approximately 4,500 Sikh soldiers left the army during this period and later came to be known as dharmi fauji (religiously motivated army deserters),"" he said.Quoting his meetings with successive presidents of SGPC, he said the association had been holding a series of internal meetings to deliberate on their future course of action, which will be announced on June 6.

SHILLONG/INDORE: Indore honeymooner Raja Raghuvanshi, whose decomposed body was found in a gorge of Weisawdong falls Monday after he disappeared with his wife Sonam on May 23, had been hacked to death with a 'dao' (machete), police said on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the couple's families demanded a CBI probe and for the Army to lead the search for Sonam.""There is no doubt it was a murder. We have recovered a 'dao'. It was new and used for this very purpose,"" East Khasi Hills SP Vivek Syiem said, adding a search for the criminals was on.

We need to look for more evidence before coming to a conclusion,"" the SP added.He said the probe was being given highest priority.

She asked the newlywed to eat something as they were hiking, but Sonam refused, saying, “Ghumne ke chakkar main vrat thodi tod dungi (Just because I am vacationing. I won’t break my fast).”The family shared a recording of this call in which Sonam sounds short of breath, telling her mother-inlaw that they were trekking in the forest to see a waterfall.

How dangerous is the 'toxic fungus'







In a ""national security"" threat, two Chinese nationals have been charged by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for allegedly conspiring to smuggle a toxic fungus into the United States terming it a ""potential agroterrorism weapon"". During the investigation, the FBI found that one of them was a member of the Chinese Communist Party.Yunqing Jian, 33, and Zunyong Liu, 34, have been charged with conspiracy, smuggling, making false statements, and visa fraud. While Jian is currently in US custody, Liu's whereabouts remain unknown.The US justice department said that the two individuals conspired to illegally bring Fusarium graminearum—a fungus that causes ""head blight"" in crops like wheat, barley, maize, and rice—into the States.""These two aliens have been charged with smuggling a fungus that has been described as a 'potential agroterrorism weapon' into the heartland of America, where they apparently intended to use a University of Michigan laboratory to further their scheme,"" US attorney Jerome Gorgon Jr said.According to scientific research, the fungus is considered a potential agroterrorism threat due to its ability to inflict billions of dollars in agricultural damage annually.It can also pose serious health risks, including vomiting, liver damage, and reproductive issues in both humans and animals.""This noxious fungus causes 'head blight,' a disease of wheat, barley, maize, and rice, and is responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide each year. Fusarium graminearum's toxins cause vomiting, liver damage, and reproductive defects in humans and livestock,"" US department of justice said.FBI recovered a scientific article on Liu’s phone titled “Plant-Pathogen Warfare under Changing Climate Conditions,” bolstering suspicions of deliberate intent.The pathogen was allegedly intended for unauthorized research at a University of Michigan lab where Liu's partner, Yunqing Jian, worked.

KYIV: Ukraine said on Tuesday that it had struck the Crimean bridge for the third time since the start of Russia's invasion, after spending months planting explosives on support structure beneath the water. The extent of the damage was not immediately clear, but the Security Service of Ukraine, the intelligence agency known as the SBU, released a statement and a video that it said showed one of the detonations.""Today, at 4.44am, without any civilian casualties, the first explosive device was detonated,"" the agency said in a statement. ""The underwater support pillars were severely damaged at the seabed level - aided by the equivalent of 1,100 kg of TNT.""Surveillance footage released by the agency and verified by NYT shows an explosion under the Kerch Strait Bridge, which connects Russia's mainland and the Crimean peninsula. The attack appeared to target support features of the bridge. It was not clear how much damage the bridge sustained. A photo from the agency shows some damage to its railing.Traffic on the bridge was suspended for about three hours Tuesday morning, and then later in the day, about an hour after the SBU published its report, it was closed again for about two hours, according to the Telegram channel that tracks the bridge's operation.The reasons for the closures were not disclosed. The bridge reopened by late afternoon.The head of the SBU, Vasyl Malyuk, wrote in a statement that Russia had continued to use the bridge ""as a logistical artery to supply its troops,"" making it a legitimate target.A Russian military blog, Rybar, run by a former Russian army service member, Mikhail Zvinchuk, said in a Telegram post that a Ukrainian underwater drone had attacked the bridge early Tuesday but that it had hit only a defensive barrier around one of the pylons.The strike on the bridge came two days after Ukraine conducted one of the most ambitious operations of the war deep inside Russia, targeting the Russian strategic bombing fleet.The Kerch Strait Bridge stretches for 19km and is a primary supply route for Moscow's forces fighting in southern Ukraine. It is deeply symbolic for President Putin, who presided over its opening in 2018. In Oct 2022, a truck laden with explosives was detonated as it crossed the bridge, causing a fireball large enough to rupture fuel tanks on a passing train and setting it on fire. The blast pulled part of the roadway off its joints and into the sea. The Russians set about repairs, but 10 months later, the bridge was hit again, this using maritime drones to target support pillars.","Ukraine says it struck the Crimean bridge for the third time since the start of Russia's invasion.

Dutch govt falls as Geert Wilders withdraws right-wing support over migration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/dutch-govt-falls-as-geert-wilders-withdraws-right-wing-support-over-migration/articleshow/121609565.cms,"



The governing coalition in the Netherlands collapsed on Tuesday after the populist leader Geert Wilders withdrew his party over a dispute about migration policy, ending a rocky 11-month rule by the country's first far-right govt and triggering early elections. The move by Wilders shows how the debate over unauthorised migration continues to roil European politics, a decade after a large-scale influx of people fleeing wars or seeking better economic opportunities unsettled the region.The coalition's collapse was confirmed by PM Dick Schoof, who said he would present his resignation to the king. He said he would stay on as the leader of a caretaker administration until the formation of a new govt. ""I think it's unnecessary and irresponsible,"" Schoof said of Wilders' decision.Wilders announced the withdrawal of his Party for Freedom from the four-party coalition on X, saying it was because of his partners' refusal to sign off on a new list of proposals to curb migration. ""No signature for our migration plans,"" he said. Wilders's party - which has advocated banning the Quran, closing Islamic schools and entirely halting the acceptance of asylum seekers - won the largest number of seats in Nov 2023 elections.Wilders was able to form a govt with three other right-wing parties after more than six months of wrangling. It was the first govt to include Wilders's party, which mainstream parties had previously shunned. But in a sign of how uncomfortable their arrangement was, the parties agreed not to name any of their own members PM. Instead they settled on Schoof, a civil servant.Wilders had aimed to bring the ""strictest migration policy ever"" to the Netherlands, something his governing partners had said they agreed with.Last week he said he wanted to add 10 more proposals and demanded immediate support from his governing partners.The proposals included calls for a complete halt to asylum, a temporary stop to family reunions for asylum seekers who had been granted refugee status and the return of all Syrians who had applied for asylum or were in the Netherlands on temporary visas. The leaders of the other coalition parties said they wanted Wilders to propose them in the House of Representatives. That would have taken longer and would not have guaranteed implementation. On Tuesday, Wilders said he had no choice but to withdraw his party. nyt","PM Dick Schoof says he will present his resignation to the king.

What we know about Soliman's family







Wife and the five children of Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the 45-year-old Egyptian national, who firebombed a Jewish gathering in Colorado, were taken into ICE custody for their speedy removal from the country. Soliman entered the US during the Biden administration and overstayed his visa, the Trump administration said. He told the investigators that he wanted to kill all Zionists and would do again. He planned the attack on the Jewish group that assembled every Sunday demanding the release of the Israelis in Gaza, but waited for her daughter's graduation.According to records, Soliman was authorized to stay through February 2, 2023 but he never left. On September 9, 2022, he filed a claim with the US Citizenship and Immigration Services. On March 29, 2023, he was granted work authorization which was valid through March this year.Soliman's daughter for whose graduation the anti-Semitic attack did not take place earlier, as Soliman claimed, graduated from Thomas Maclaren State Charter School in Colorado Springs. According to reports, she came to the US with her father two years ago and is also probably an illegal alien.Trump-aide Laura Loomer said that a Colorado newspaper did a profile piece on his daughter, Habiba Soliman, for attending the school in hijab.According to the article, she described in her scholarship application how her family had immigrated to the US after living in Kuwait, noting that her father had undergone a “difficult surgery” when she was young “that restored his ability to walk.” The girl said the incident inspired her to pursue medical school – a dream that would have been impossible in Kuwait but within reach in America.Police said after Soliman's arrest, his family members cooperated with the investigation. They were not privy to Soliman's plan.","Wife and five children of Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the 45-year-old Egyptian national, who firebombed a Jewish gathering in Colorado, were taken into ICE custody for their speedy removal from the country.

SEATTLE: Law enforcement discovered a cache of weaponry and armour, including a machine gun and grenade launchers, along with Nazi paraphernalia during a raid of a home in Washington state, authorities said Tuesday.Derek Sanders, the elected sheriff of Thurston County, said in a Facebook post that the US Army Criminal Investigation Division asked his office for assistance Monday as an FBI special weapons and tactics team executed a search warrant in Lacey, near the state capitol of Olympia, ""as a result of a violent robbery and theft of military weaponry/armour.""The US Attorney's Office in Seattle said in a statement to The Associated Press on Tuesday night that the search warrant related to an Army CID and FBI investigation into an assault Sunday at Joint Base Lewis-McCord, just north of Olympia.Sanders' statement said two people were arrested and booked into Thurston County Jail for investigation of firearms-related offenses.""The suspects identified in this case were actively involved in Nazi White Nationalist efforts,"" he wrote.Sanders did not immediately return messages seeking comment Tuesday night.The US Attorney's Office statement said Army investigators had identified suspects in the assault at the military base and the FBI executed the search warrant late Monday night into early Tuesday.Reached for comment, the FBI said its Seattle office was ""assisting our partners Thurston County Sheriff's Office and Army Criminal Investigation Division"" and referred questions to them.Additional information was expected to be included in a federal criminal complaint to be unsealed Wednesday.

Political tensions and retaliation claims





Harvard University on Monday asked a federal judge to issue a summary judgment ordering the unfreezing of $2.5 billion in federal research funding that has been halted by the Trump administration, which Harvard says is illegal.The university contends that the freeze jeopardizes over 950 critical research projects, including those related to national security and public health.In a filing with the US district court in Boston, Harvard argues that the funding suspension is both unlawful and politically motivated. The university asserts that the freeze violates its rights to free speech and due process and undermines academic independence.Trump has been attempting to force change at Harvard and other top American universities, because of his view that these have been captured by the left-wing woke and has led to the rise of antisemitism.The Trump administration has not yet responded to this latest move by the university.US district judge Allison Burroughs has set July 21 for the arguments on the Harvard case seeking summary judgement, which refers to a request to the judge to decide a dispute without a trial to determine material facts.The funding freeze affects a wide array of research initiatives, including studies on cancer, infectious diseases, and biological threat awareness for the department of defence. A defence advanced research projects agency (DARPA) official highlighted in court documents that canceling a $12 million grant for biological threat research at Harvard could pose ""grave and immediate harm to national security.""Additionally, the freeze threatens research in areas such as pediatric HIV and dark energy, potentially hindering advancements in both medical and scientific fields.Harvard's legal challenge comes amid escalating tensions with the Trump administration. The university alleges that the funding freeze is a retaliatory measure following its refusal to comply with a list of demands from the White House, which included changes to hiring practices and student discipline regulations.Besides, multiple other investigations have been opened into Harvard, including some looking into threats against Jewish students and faculty after pro-Palestine protests broke out following the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.Further escalating the situation, the administration attempted to revoke Harvard's certification under the student and exchange visitor program, effectively barring the university from enrolling international students. This move was temporarily halted by a federal judge, but it has added to the university's concerns about political interference in academic affairs.","Harvard University has asked a federal judge to order the unfreezing of $2.5 billion in federal research funding halted by the Trump administration.

WASHINGTON: The federal Bureau of Prisons must continue providing hormone therapy and social accommodations to hundreds of transgender inmates following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump that led to a disruption in medical treatment, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.US District Judge Royce Lamberth said a federal law prohibits prison officials from arbitrarily depriving inmates of medications and other lifestyle accommodations that its own medical staff has deemed to be appropriate.The judge said the transgender inmates who sued to block Trump's executive order are trying to lessen the personal anguish caused by their gender dysphoria, which is the distress that a person feels because their assigned gender and gender identity don't match.""In light of the plaintiffs' largely personal motives for undergoing gender-affirming care, neither the BOP nor the Executive Order provides any serious explanation as to why the treatment modalities covered by the Executive Order or implementing memoranda should be handled differently than any other mental health intervention,"" he wrote.The Bureau of Prisons is providing hormone therapy to more than 600 inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria.The bureau doesn't dispute that gender dysphoria can cause severe side effects, including depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts, the judge said.The Republican president's executive order required the bureau to revise its medical care policies so that federal funds aren't spent ""for the purpose of conforming an inmate's appearance to that of the opposite sex.""Lamberth's ruling isn't limited to the plaintiffs named in the lawsuit. He agreed to certify a class of plaintiffs consisting of anyone who is or will be incarcerated in federal prisons.Trump's order also directed the federal Bureau of Prisons to ensure that ""males are not detained in women's prisons."" In February, however, Lamberth agreed to temporarily block prison officials from transferring three incarcerated transgender women to men's facilities and terminating their access to hormone therapy.The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the Transgender Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union.Lamberth, a senior judge, was nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan in 1987.",President Donald Trump signed an executive order that led to a disruption in medical treatment.

Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, who is running for the New York City mayoral race, torched the Republicans and President Donald Trump after a Republican councilwoman called for his deportation. Mamdani, a New York state assembly member, is an Indian-Ugandan-American who became a US citizen after 2016 -- during Donald Trump's first term. Mamdani's father Mahmood Mamdani is an India-born Ugandan academic and his mother Mira Nair is an Indian-American filmmaker.In 2019, Mamdani campaigned for Bernie Sanders for 2020 and said he was excited, as 2020 would be his first presidential vote as he was not a US citizen in 2016. ""I couldn’t vote for @BernieSanders in 2016 because I wasn’t a citizen yet, but I can’t wait for my first presidential vote to be for him in 2020.

""Death threats. Islamophobic bigotry. Now a sitting Councilmember calling for my deportation. Enough. This is what Trump and his sycophants have wrought. It’s an assault on the values of our city and our Constitution. Will Cuomo condemn this or will that upset his MAGA donors?""

Green card holders barred from purchasing land in Ohio? What a proposed bill says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/green-card-holders-barred-from-purchasing-land-in-ohio-what-a-proposed-bill-says/articleshow/121602093.cms,"Green card holders may not be able to buy land in Ohio if a proposed bill gets passed.

List of nationals who can't buy land in Ohio if the bill is passed







A bill proposed by Ohio lawmakers could prohibit some green card holders from certain countries from purchasing land across the state. The bill adheres to America First policy, Ohio state representative Angel King (R), one of the sponsors of the bill, told Newsweek. The existing green card holders who already have a property are can't purchase a new property within the bill's outlined 25-mile radius, King said.Introduced by Representatives King and Roy Klopfenstein, House Bill 1, seeks to limit who can be a land owner. ""This is about protecting our obligation to keep our power stations, water treatment plants, and gas lines safe from surveillance and espionage,"" King said.The aim is to save Ohio land from foreign citizens especially from countries like China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela and Syria within 25 miles of ""critical infrastructure"". The bill exempts American citizens or those with dual citizenship from the ban.Under the bill, the list of land that would fall under “protected property” is long. It includes any railroad property, a dam operating by the state or federal government, and trucking terminals. The bill also includes airports, military bases and farmland. County sheriffs would be responsible for enforcing the new restrictions. If the legislation passes, individuals subject to the prohibition would be required to sell restricted property within two years.Similar laws exist in Florida and Texas but they also faced lawsuits and national debate.""The bill is part of a broader national push to address concerns about foreign land ownership tied to national security. However, as currently written, the legislation would create sweeping limitations that affect far more than high-risk transactions, including everyday residential purchases,"" Ohio Realtors said.ChinaRussiaIranNorth KoreaCubaVenezuelaSyriaOhio's secretary of state would have to update the list every six months, the proposed bill said.","House Bill 1 seeks to limit who can be a land owner.

How the jailbreak unfolded





A routine safety measure after earthquake tremors turned into a major security breach in Karachi, as over 100 inmates escaped from prison on Tuesday.Officials said the prisoners had been evacuated from their cells as a precaution following a series of mild earthquakes in the area, but chaos erupted when a group of inmates attacked guards, seized their weapons, and managed to flee.According to senior police official Kashif Abbasi, 216 inmates escaped from Malir prison before dawn. He confirmed that 78 of them had already been caught.Police teams were carrying out raids to find the rest. “No one convicted or facing trial as a militant is among those who fled,” Abbasi said.The escape led to a shootout in which one inmate was killed and three security personnel were injured. “The situation has been brought under control,” Abbasi added.Sindh’s home minister, Ziaul Hassan, explained how the jailbreak unfolded. The inmates had been moved out of their cells due to tremors. While they were still outside, some prisoners attacked the guards and fled the premises after opening fire.Prison Superintendent Arshad Shah said the escapees headed towards nearby residential areas. Residents reported that police later used mosque loudspeakers to warn them about the escaped inmates and requested help in identifying and reporting them.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah made a televised appeal, urging the escapees to turn themselves in. “They had only been involved in minor crimes until that point,” he said. “But they could face terror charges if they are arrested by police on the jailbreak charge.”Although prison escapes have happened during court transfers in Pakistan, such mass breakouts from within prison walls remain rare.Karachi has experienced multiple earthquakes in the past 24 hours, with magnitudes ranging from 2.6 to 3.4, according to the National Seismic Monitoring Center.", 216 inmates escaped from Malir prison in Karachi on Tuesday morning.

Shehbaz Sharif’s Tajikistan visit caps diplomatic tour amid India tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/did-india-hits-impede-pak-move-to-retaliate/articleshow/121499612.cms,"Photo/Agencies





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wrapped up a five-day, four-nation diplomatic tour in Tajikistan on Thursday, aiming to bolster regional ties and challenge India’s terrorism accusations.The tour, spanning Iran, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan, came after a tense military standoff with India earlier this month. Joined by Field Marshal Asim Munir and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, Sharif sought to project Pakistan as a peace-seeking nation amid rising regional friction.The tour’s backdrop was a May 9-10 clash. Media outlets posted on Thursday videos of Sharif, during his Azerbaijan visit, purportedly admitting to India’s preemptive BrahMos missile strikes on Pakistani military sites impeding Pakistan’s attempts to retaliate. However, neither Pakistani outlets nor Azerbaijan’s govt have confirmed Sharif’s statement about BrahMos. TOI was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the video.Sharif’s mission was clear: counter India’s global push — visiting over 30 countries to brand Pakistan a terror sponsor, a charge Islamabad rejects. In Azerbaijan, he stressed Pakistan’s willingness to discuss Kashmir and terrorism with India, saying, “If India engages sincerely, we’re ready.”This stance, reiterated in Tajikistan, framed Pakistan as a peace broker while painting India as belligerent. Talks with Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev aimed to lock in support against India’s rhetoric.In Tajikistan, Sharif shifted focus to economic and security ties with Central Asia, a region where India and Pakistan compete for sway. The tour, just two weeks after the standoff, reflects Pakistan’s haste to reshape its image. Yet, India’s narrative of counterterrorism retains global traction.With a fragile ceasefire extended to May 18 hanging in the balance, Sharif’s peace calls face an uphill battle against India’s military-first approach. Meetings in Türkiye and beyond highlighted Pakistan’s reliance on allies to offset India’s influence. Still, the tour’s success hinges on whether these overtures can pierce India’s diplomatic armor.The broader India-Pakistan rivalry played out vividly here — diplomacy and perception as fiercely contested as their borders. Sharif’s tour, while crisp in intent, navigates a murky web of unverified claims, strategic posturing, and regional ambitions, leaving the path to peace as elusive as ever.","Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wrapped up a five-day, four-nation diplomatic tour in Tajikistan on Thursday.
