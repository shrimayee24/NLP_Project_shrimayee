PM Modi’s dig at West: Democracy’s ‘flagbearers’ acting like ‘nawabs’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modis-dig-at-west-democracys-flagbearers-acting-like-nawabs/articleshow/126894548.cms,"Modi had previously visited Motihari, Siwan, Madhubani and Patna since April.

PM Modi Signals Generational Shift As Nitin Nabin Becomes New BJP President, Calls Him His Boss

It may seem to people that Narendra Modi is the third-term PM of the country, he became CM at only 50 years of age and has been head of a govt for 25 continuous years. But above all this in my life is the fact that I am a BJP worker. This is my biggest pride, PM Modi said.He chose the occasion to emphasise the role of BJP’s organisational strength and discipline behind its rise, contrasting this with decline of Congress from the all-time high of over 400 parliamentary seats and nearly 50% votes in 1984 — the largest mandate for any political party — to its current struggle to win even 100 seats.“Congress can never introspect over its decline because it will raise questions over the family which has captured it. They keep looking for excuses. They have lost courage to look for even correct reasons behind their fall,” he said. LoP in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi has repeatedly blamed an alleged collusion of EC and BJP for “vote chori” behind Congress’s string of dismal poll shows.“This family rule is an enemy of democracy,” Modi said and recalled after BJP’s big win in 2002 Gujarat polls, when he was CM, he was at a meeting to review reasons for its loss in some seats.BJP started as a party with a difference and has become the preferred party of governance, he said, in a nod to its “unprecedented” strike rate in recent assembly and civic polls.Raising the issue of infiltration and demographic imbalance, which he had flagged at a recent rally in assembly poll-bound West Bengal, Modi said even rich and strong countries are deporting infiltrators. “The world does not question them for expelling infiltrators,” he said, adding that these nations would claim to be flag-bearers of democracy and act like “nawabs (lords)” of the world. No country accepts infiltrators, he said, without naming any nation. While US has launched an expansive crackdown on infiltrators, several wealthy countries are also tightening measures against them.Asserting that India, too, cannot allow illegals on its soil, he called them a big threat to national security. “We will have to expose parties that are shielding them for vote-bank politics,” he said.In the same breath, he also slammed “urban naxals”, saying they are acquiring international dimensions and conspiring to harm India. They must be defeated by the party’s organisational and ideological strength, he said. Maoism is in its last breath in the country, he said.Modi touched on a host of his govt’s welfare measures and said he is giving an account of his work to the new chief who will write his confidential report, drawing good cheers from the audience.","PM Narendra Modi visited Motihari, Siwan, Madhubani and Patna since April.

High drama in Tamil Nadu assembly: Governor R N Ravi walks out; alleges 'national anthem insulted',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/national-anthem-again-insulted-tamil-nadu-governor-r-n-ravi-walks-out-of-assembly-skips-customary-address/articleshow/126757117.cms,"Tamil Nadu governor RN Ravi (IANS photo)

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu governor RN Ravi walked out of the state assembly on Tuesday before delivering his inaugural address, expressing disappointment over what he said was a lack of respect for the national anthem . He also claimed that his microphone was switched off during the proceedings.“I am disappointed. National Anthem was not given due respect,” the governor said. He added that “it is unfortunate that his speech was interrupted.”Inside the House, the situation led to a sharp exchange, with assembly Speaker M Appavu urging the governor to follow established rules and customs of the assembly.Later, Raj Bhavan issued a press release explaining the reasons behind the governor’s walkout. “The governor’s mic was repeatedly switched off, and he was not allowed to speak,” the statement said. It also claimed that issues such as “atrocities against Dalits and sexual violence against Dalit women are sharply increasing,” but were “totally bypassed in the speech.”The release further alleged that the “National Anthem is yet again insulted, and the Fundamental Constitutional Duty is disregarded.”Meanwhile, AIADMK general secretary and leader of opposition in assembly Edappadi Palaniswamy raised slogans with party leaders at the entrance of assembly after they walked out from the House over law and order issues in Tamil Nadu.This was not the first such incident. A similar episode took place last year when governor Ravi walked out of the Assembly in what he described as “deep anguish,” alleging that the “constitution of Bharat” and the National Anthem were insulted.With Assembly elections drawing closer, the session is being viewed as politically crucial. Opposition parties, including the AIADMK and the BJP, are expected to level several allegations against the ruling party and the state government.Chief minister M K Stalin and his Cabinet colleagues are preparing to counter the attacks, setting the stage for a tense and politically charged assembly session.",Tamil Nadu governor RN Ravi walked out of the state assembly on Tuesday before delivering his inaugural address.

'We Are United...Will Go To Delhi If High Command Calls': Siddaramaiah, Shivakumar After Meeting

NEW DELHI: The ongoing tension over the Karnataka chief minister 's post resurfaced on Tuesday after DK Shivakumar ’s brother said Rahul Gandhi had assured the deputy chief minister that a decision would be taken at an appropriate time.Former MP DK Suresh described Shivakumar as a committed party functionary and said the Congress leadership, including Gandhi, had asked him to exercise restraint while assuring him that the matter would be resolved in due course.“The party has already asked him to be patient. Rahul Gandhi, during the meeting in Mysuru, also said that an appropriate decision would be taken at the right time,"" news agency PTI reported him as saying.He also said that Shivakumar’s approach was guided by the need to keep all 140 Congress legislators together and maintain stability in the government. Emphasising that political authority requires perseverance, he added, “In the interest of the party and legislators, and with the goal of keeping all 140 legislators together, he is patiently waiting for the party’s decision.”With an eye on the 2028 assembly elections, Suresh also stressed that unity within the Congress would be critical.“He is also the party president and should maintain discipline first, which he is following diligently,"" he said refering to Shivakumar.The leadership churn in Karnataka intensified after the Congress government completed the halfway mark of its five-year term on November 20, 2025. The speculation centres on a reported power-sharing understanding between Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar at the time of government formation in 2023. Shivakumar has previously said discussions on the issue were held with the Congress high command and that while a decision had been taken, its timing is yet to be finalised.Suresh indicated that the upcoming legislative session, scheduled from January 22 to 31, could be a reference point, after which the party leadership’s stand may become clearer.Meanwhile, chief minister Siddaramaiah said he would travel to New Delhi if called by the Congress high command to discuss the leadership issue. He reiterated that any such engagement would depend on a formal summons from the party leadership. ""I will go if I am called by the Congress high command,"" he said.Siddaramaiah also sought to shift focus to governance, noting that the joint session of the state legislature would be held from January 22 to 31, alongside a special session on MGNREGA.

Security personnel were trying to identify the overground workers who may have assisted the terrorists in transporting large quantities of assorted rations, utensils, and other consumable and logistic supplies, which were enough to provide sustenance during the winter months.Earlier on Tuesday, a wreath-laying ceremony was organised in Jammu to pay tributes to Army Special Forces Commando, Havildar Gajendra Singh, who died Monday after suffering grenade splinter and bullet wounds during an overnight gun battle with terrorists during the ongoing operation. He was among eight soldiers wounded late Sunday when terrorists ambushed a joint Army–police search team in dense forests near Sonnar, close to the LoC.This was the first security force death in a counter-terrorism operation in the Union Territory in 2026.The ceremony at Satwari was led by Brig Yudhvir Singh Sekhon, Officiating Chief of Staff, White Knight Corps. DIG (Jammu-Kathua-Samba Range) Shiv Kumar Sharma, Jammu Deputy Commissioner Rakesh Minhas, and several top police, CRPF and BSF officers paid tributes. Singh’s mortal remains were later dispatched to his native place in Uttarakhand for the last rites, an official said.Senior officers, including IGP (Jammu Zone) Bhim Sen Tuti and IG-CRPF (Jammu), were currently camping in the area along with several senior Army officers to supervise the operation.This operation is the third this year in Jammu division, following clashes earlier this month in Kahog and Najote forests of Billawar in Kathua, south of Pir Panjal range.

SRINAGAR: National Conference president Dr Farooq Abdullah on Tuesday rejected demands for further division of Jammu and Kashmir , and instead insisted on Ladakh’s reunification with J&K.He also dismissed PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti ’s proposal for carving out Muslim majority areas of Jammu as a separate division of J&K, calling it an advocacy of the ‘Dixon Plan’ — a proposal made in Sept 1950 by Sir Owen Dixon, an Australian judge who came to the subcontinent as the UN representative to mediate between India and Pakistan following the latter’s invasion of Kashmir in 1947-48.“J&K state comprises Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, and the day is not far when Ladakh will again be part of Jammu and Kashmir,” Farooq told reporters in Jammu. “Ladakhis have not benefited from the region’s separation from Jammu and Kashmir. Even today, people in Ladakh want to be reunited with J&K, and do not want Union Territory status.”He summarily rejected the idea of separation of Jammu from Kashmir, saying: “Those demanding separate statehood for Jammu are ignorant and lack any understanding.”Countering BJP ’s allegation that NC and PDP thrived on unrest, Farooq said: “We have taken bullets for staying with India, and we are ready to take them again if needed.” It was “them (BJP), not us” who wanted to create disturbance, he asserted.A debate on further bifurcation of J&K started earlier this month after BJP legislator Sham Lal Sharma raised a pitch for a separate Jammu state, alleging discrimination against the region by “Kashmir-based rulers”.While NC functionary and J&K’s deputy chief minister Surinder Choudhary on Monday categorically rejected the demand and called for Ladakh to be reunited with J&K, PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti waded into the debate and floated a proposal for further division of Jammu instead.Mehbooba said the Pir Panjal region, comprising Rajouri and Poonch districts, and the Chenab Valley, comprising Doda and Kishtwar districts, should be carved out as separate divisions. All four districts are part of the Jammu division.Rejecting the demand, Farooq said: “It is the Dixon Plan. It was an old plan to divide J&K along the Chenab river, making it ‘Greater Kashmir’. But Parmar Sahib (first chief minister of Himachal Pradesh Y S Parmar) opposed any such division,” he said, adding that there is no need to carve out further divisions or districts in Jammu.BJP spokesman Altaf Thakur on Tuesday described Mehbooba’s demand for divisional status to Pir Panjal and Chenab Valley as “deeply conspiratorial, divisive and anti-national agenda that mirrors the long-standing strategy of Pakistan’s ISI”. “Mehbooba Mufti is not speaking for the people of Pir Panjal or Chenab Valley; she is repeating the language of Pakistan and its ISI, which has always dreamt of creating a so-called ‘Greater Kashmir’ by gradually absorbing Jammu’s Muslim-majority belts into Kashmir. This is a dangerous experiment on India’s sovereignty,” Thakur said.Reacting to the statements of Farooq and BJP, the PDP chief slammed NC and BJP for casting aspersions on her, saying her demand was purely administrative, and that her only agenda was to ensure development and better governance of these regions, which remained “neglected”.",National Conference president Dr Farooq Abdullah rejects demands for further division of Jammu and Kashmir.

Manikarnika Ghat row: Politics over demolition and clearing drive in Varanasi — what's the controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/manikarnika-ghat-row-politics-over-demolition-and-clearing-drive-in-varanasi-whats-the-controversy/articleshow/126789982.cms,"PTI file photo

What's the controversy

The controversy began after a demolition and clearing drive at Manikarnika Ghat as part of a beautification and strengthening project.

Heavy machinery was used to remove encroachments and old structures at the site. During the process, several ancient idols and artefacts were reportedly found.

Claims and images circulated on social media alleging damage to temples and statues, including that of Ahilyadevi Holkar.

Uttar Pradesh Police registered eight FIRs at Chowk Police Station in Varanasi over AI-generated images and alleged misleading information related to the project.

Local authorities said these idols and artefacts have been secured by the culture department and will be reinstalled after construction is completed.

Who said what

Congress leader Nana Patole on Tuesday said the demolition drive was an insult to Hindus and accused the BJP of destroying age-old heritage at Manikarnika Ghat. Patole announced he would visit the ghat and hold a protest, alleging that a tourist spot was being created in the name of a corridor.

Mallikarjun Kharge criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleging that the move was aimed at erasing historical heritage in order to “simply affix” his own nameplate. ""You have committed the crime of demolishing the rare ancient heritage of Manikarnika Ghat, which was described in the Gupta period and later restored by Lokmata Ahilyabai Holkar, under the pretext of renovation,"" Kharge said in a post on X.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also criticised the government, saying that destroying the country’s religious and historical heritage in the name of development to serve the commercial interests of a few individuals was a “grave sin.”

Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav posted a before-and-after images on X that he claimed showed a damaged statue, captioned: “Statue of Ahilyabai was found buried under debris.”

BSP chief Mayawati expressed concern over reports of the removal of Ahilyadevi Holkar’s statue and said the issue had angered large sections of society. In a post on X, SHE said, ""The news of the removal of Ahilyabai Holkar's statue in Varanasi has not only sparked widespread discussion but has also caused considerable anger and resentment among a large section of the society.

Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath warned of “strict action” against those spreading misinformation alleging that the scale of development in Varanasi had unsettled the Congress and its allies.“Kashi today is witnessing unprecedented development,” with projects worth over Rs 55,000 crore implemented so far, beginning with the Shri Kashi Vishwanath Corridor. He claimed earlier attempts were also made to mislead people by showing broken idols, but said “the truth is before everyone now,” noting that daily devotees had risen to 1–1.5 lakh from 10,000–15,000 earlier. Calling the allegations over Manikarnika Ghat “baseless,” Adityanath said the people of Kashi were aware of the facts and stood with the development works.

NEW DELHI: The controversy over Manikarnika Ghat in Varanasi has intensified as the opposition attacked the BJP-led state government over the demolition and clearing drive at one of Hinduism’s most sacred cremation grounds.The drive, carried out as part of a beautification and strengthening project, involved the use of heavy machinery to remove encroachments and old structures.The issue quickly turned political after opposition leaders alleged that ancient heritage and religious symbols were damaged during the process.The Uttar Pradesh government and BJP leaders have denied these claims, saying the work is aimed at protecting heritage, improving safety, and correcting years of neglect. Police have also registered FIRs over what they describe as misleading information circulating online.","The controversy began after a demolition and clearing drive at Manikarnika Ghat as part of a beautification and strengthening project.

West Bengal SIR Brings Home A Man Presumed Dead For 28 Years In UP’s Muzaffarnagar

Purba Medinipur

TMC vs EC

NEW DELHI: Roads were blocked and tyres set ablaze as several districts in West Bengal erupted in protests on Tuesday over alleged harassment of people during the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in the poll-bound state, police saidAccording to a senior official, the demonstrations took place in South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas, Jhargram, and Purba Medinipur, prompting authorities to strengthen force deployment in these areas.The chaos erupted a day after the Supreme Court stressed that the SIR process in West Bengal must be “transparent” and should not cause “inconvenience” to electors.The top court also instructed the Election Commission (EC) to display the names of those on the “logical discrepancies” list at gram panchayat bhavans and block offices, where documents and objections could be submitted.Protesters alleged that, despite possessing valid documents, elderly citizens and genuine voters were being served SIR notices under the pretext of “logical discrepancies” or being “mismatched with the voter list of 2002,” from when the SIR was last conducted in the state.In South 24 Parganas, demonstrators blocked roads in areas including Dholahat and Polba. Security personnel were deployed to clear the obstructions and prevent the situation from escalating.“A few roads were blocked temporarily, but the situation is now under control. We are in constant touch with local representatives and ensuring that no adverse law-and-order situation develops,” a senior police officer told PTI.In Purba Medinipur’s Haldia Debhog Gram Panchayat, locals alleged that around 650 of 1,248 voters from booth number 269 in Manoharpur received hearing notices, with a majority belonging to minority communities.Expressing helplessness, a senior police officer said, “We have no role in issuing hearing notices. Our responsibility is limited to maintaining law and order. We are ensuring that protests remain peaceful and that essential services are not disrupted.”Another officer urged people “not to spread rumours or take the law into their hands” and added that grievances should be addressed with the appropriate authorities.Protesters warned that agitation could intensify if corrective measures were not taken. Security forces remain on alert across sensitive areas to prevent further unrest.The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC), in power in West Bengal since 2011, has repeatedly voiced concerns over the ongoing voter list revision process since . Chief minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee even wrote to Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, demanding a halt to the SIR drive.After the first phase, the draft electoral rolls, published on December 16 last year, showed the electorate shrinking from 7.66 crore to 7.08 crore, with over 58 lakh names deleted statewide.According to EC officials, the exclusions in the first phase were based on reasons such as death, permanent migration, duplication, and non-submission of enumeration forms.The poll panel has emphasised that voters marked as unmapped or discrepant are being given an opportunity to be heard. The final electoral rolls are scheduled to be published on February 14.",Roads were blocked and tyres set ablaze as several districts in West Bengal erupted in protests.

The Kerala assembly on Tuesday saw a rare and tense moment, soon after governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar finished his address to the house.Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan stood up and told the assembly that the governor had not read the cabinet-approved policy address in full. He said certain parts of the speech, cleared by the state cabinet, were skipped and some was added.Vijayan said the governor did not read the opening line of paragraph 12 and the concluding part of paragraph 15. These portions criticised the BJP-led union government’s fiscal policies and mentioned bills passed by the Kerala assembly that were still awaiting approval from the Raj Bhavan.One of the omitted lines spoke about Kerala facing “severe fiscal stress” due to actions by the union government that, according to the text, weakened fiscal federalism. Another missing section referred to bills remaining pending for long periods and said the state government had approached the Supreme Court, where the matter was now before a constitution bench.It read: ""Despite these social and institutional achievements, Kerala continues to face severe fiscal stress arising from a series of adverse union government actions that undermine the constitutional principles of fiscal federalism.""The other statement read: ""Bills passed by state legislatures have remained pending for prolonged periods. My government has approached the Supreme Court on these issues, which have been referred to a constitution bench. ""The chief minister also pointed out that the governor made an addition to paragraph 16. Vijayan said Arlekar inserted the words “my government considers” into a line that stated tax devolution and finance commission grants are constitutional rights of states and not acts of charity.""Tax devolution and finance commission grants are constitutional entitlements of states and not acts of charity, and any pressure on constitutional bodies entrusted with this task undermines federal principles,"" Vijayan remaked.Vijayan further urged the speaker to recognise only the version of the policy address approved by the state cabinet as the official record, without the omissions or additions.Speaker A N Shamseer said past precedents of the house do not recognise any changes made to a cabinet-approved address. He said the same rule would apply in this case as well.Lok Bhavan Kerala on Tuesday defended the changes made by governor. In a statement, Lok Bhavan said the governor had asked the state government to remove what it described as “half-truths” from the draft policy address. According to Lok Bhavan, the government agreed to this request.Lok Bhavan said the government told the governor that he could prepare and read the policy address with the amendments he considered necessary. It also said the revised speech would be sent again after incorporating the suggested changes.However, Lok Bhavan said the state government later returned the same draft without making the changes. After this, the governor decided to go ahead with the address, including the amendments he had suggested.Meanwhile, a similar confrontation played out in the Tamil Nadu assembly where governor R N Ravi refused to read out the state government-prepared address and walked out of the assembly.Governor Ravi later said he was disappointed over what he described as a lack of respect for the national anthem. He also claimed his microphone was switched off during the proceedings and his speech was interrupted.",Governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar finished his address to the house.

PM Modi Says Parties Shielding Illegal Immigrants Must Be Exposed, Calls It a National Threat

'

Urban Naxalism

a major challenge'

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday doubled down on his government's ambition to detect and deport illegal immigrants in the country, while strongly criticising the political parties ""protecting or covering up for illegal immigrants for the sake of vote bank politics"".Addressing the party workers after the new BJP chief Nitin Nabin took charge, PM Modi said: ""Illegal immigrants pose a great threat to the country's security. Identifying them and sending them back to their countries is absolutely essential.""""No country in the world accepts illegal immigrants. India, too, cannot allow illegal immigrants to steal the rights of our poor and our youth. Illegal immigrants pose a great threat to the country's security. Identifying them and sending them back to their countries is absolutely essential,"" PM Modi said during an address at the BJP headquarters.Without naming any political party, but in an apparent attack on Trinamool Congress (TMC), which rules the poll-bound West Bengal, PM Modi lashed out at parties ""covering up for illegal immigrants"" and said: ""We must expose them to the public"".PM Modi also said the world doesn't question the ""wealthiest and most powerful countries"" when they crack down on illegal immigrants.""Even the world's wealthiest and most powerful countries are investigating and apprehending illegal immigrants within their borders and deporting them. And the world doesn't question them, asking, ""Why are you deporting these illegal immigrants? You were waving the flag of democracy. You were acting like the rulers of the world, so why are you doing this?"" PM Modi said.Stepping up his offensive against the BJP's nemesis, PM Modi said another major challenge is ""urban Naxalism"", the scope of which he said has become ""international"".The Prime Minister said that the ""urban Naxals isolated the BJP"" and treated the party like ""untouchables throughout the country,"" adding he said urban Naxals are ""continuously working to harm India"".""Another major challenge is urban Naxalism. The scope of urban Naxalism is becoming international. If they tweet something positive about Modi even once or twice a year, or say something positive on TV, or write something positive in a newspaper, some journalists humiliate them so much that they are hounded and made untouchable. They are silenced so that they can never speak again. This is the method of urban Naxalism,"" PM Modi said.The PM further said: ""For years, they isolated the BJP and treated us like untouchables throughout the country. Now the country is understanding the actions of these urban Naxals.

'Over 100 People Watched': Eyewitness, Father Recall Failed Rescue As Noida Techie Cried For Help

NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday used the term “TINA” to criticise the government over the death of a Noida-based techie whose car plunged into a water-filled pit in Greater Noida’s Sector 150 area.TINA, which stands for “There Is No Accountability”, was used by the Congress leader to argue that such incidents in urban areas do not occur due to lack of money or solutions, but because of lack of accountability.In a post on X, Gandhi said:“India’s urban collapse isn’t about lack of money, technology, or solutions. It’s about lack of accountability.TINA : There Is No Accountability.”The incident involved 27-year-old engineer Yuvraj Mehta, who died after his car skidded off the road Friday night amid dense fog and plunged into an over 20-feet-deep, water-filled pit in Greater Noida. The victim’s family alleged that the site was accident-prone and that repeated requests to install barricades and reflectors were ignored, leading to the tragedy.Following the incident, an FIR was filed against two real estate developers. The Uttar Pradesh government also sacked Noida CEO Lokesh M and formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to inquire into the death.Mehta’s father accused the police and other agencies of delay in rescuing his son. He said that even though the techie was alive and shouting for help when policemen reached the spot, they did not know how to swim.A senior police officer later told TOI that knowing how to swim is not a mandatory requirement for a police officer. Mehta, who could not swim and managed to stay afloat by clinging to the car, eventually went down crying for help.The SIT will be headed by additional director general (ADG) of the Meerut Zone Bhanu Bhaskar. Divisional commissioner Bhanu Chandra Goswami and the chief engineer of the Public Works Department will be the other members. The team has been directed to submit its report to the Chief Minister within five days.","Rahul Gandhi uses term 'TINA' to criticise the government over the death of a Noida-based techie.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump has invited India to be part of a proposed international “Board of Peace” aimed at overseeing post-war governance and reconstruction in Gaza. The initiative forms a key pillar of Trump’s broader Gaza ceasefire plan and is now beginning to take shape, with the White House confirming the involvement of several global figures.In a letter, shared by US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor, Trump framed the initiative as part of a sweeping 20-point “Comprehensive Plan” to end the Gaza conflict, first announced in September last year. He said the plan had since received wide backing from global leaders across the Arab world, Israel and Europe, and was formally endorsed by the United Nations Security Council through Resolution 2803 in November.Trump wrote that the moment had come to “turn dreams into reality”, with the centrepiece of the initiative being the creation of an international “Board of Peace”. The body, Trump said, would be established as a new international organisation and transitional governing administration, tasked with delivering what he called “lasting peace” through governance reform, reconstruction and economic investment.""Now it is time to turn all of these Dreams into reality. At the heart of the Plan is The Board of Peace, the most impressive and consequential Board ever assembled, which will be established as a new International Organization and Transitional Governing Administration,"" the letter read.The invitation places India among a growing list of countries and global figures being courted by Washington as Trump seeks to operationalise a 20-point “Comprehensive Plan” aimed at ending the Gaza conflict and managing the transition to long-term stability.According to the White House, the Board of Peace will serve as the central strategic body overseeing Gaza’s post-war transition. Chaired by Trump himself, it is expected to focus on governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment mobilisation and large-scale funding.Confirmed members include US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump’s special negotiator Steve Witkoff, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, former UK prime minister Tony Blair, billionaire financier Marc Rowan, World Bank president Ajay Banga and senior National Security Council aide Robert Gabriel. More appointments are expected in the coming weeks.Alongside the main board, two additional structures have been announced. The National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), led by Palestinian technocrat Dr Ali Sha’ath, will oversee the restoration of public services, rebuilding of civil institutions and stabilisation of daily life in Gaza. The White House has described this as a key step in implementing Phase Two of Trump’s plan.A separate Gaza Executive Board will support governance delivery on the ground and includes international diplomats and regional figures from Turkey, Qatar, Egypt, Israel and the UAE, as well as UN humanitarian coordinator Sigrid Kaag.Apart from India several countries including Argentina, Canada, Egypt, Turkey, Albania and Cyprus have been invited. Pakistan has also been invited to join the Board of Peace. Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that the prime minister received the invitation, adding that Pakistan will continue supporting international efforts for peace and security in Gaza.As per a report by Bloomberg, a draft charter proposes of the Trump-led “Board of Peace,” allegedly requires nations to contribute $1 billion to secure long-term membership. The draft gives Trump authority over membership, renewals, and final approval of decisions.","US President Donald Trump has invited India to be part of a proposed international “Board of Peace” The Board of Peace will serve as the central strategic body overseeing Gaza’s post-war transition.

Protesters in Denmark have taken to the streets to oppose US President Donald Trump ’s rigid push to acquire the Arctic island -- Greenland, wearing red baseball caps spoofing his iconic MAGA hats -- this time emblazoned with the slogan “Make America Go Away.”MAGA hats have become symbolic of Danish and Greenlandic defiance against the US president’s threat to seize the Arctic territory.The caps reading “Make America Go Away,” a parody of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, have gained popularity on social media and at public protests, including a weekend demonstration in freezing weather in the Danish capital.Several European countries have also joined Denmark and Greenland in pushing back against Donald Trump, stressing the need to defend the Arctic and warning that threats to Greenland undermine Western security.Protesters, however, have been far more blunt.“I want to show my support to Greenland and also show that I don’t like the president of the United States,” ABC news quoted a 76-year-old Copenhagen resident Lars Hermansen, who wore one of the red caps at a protest on Saturday.The mock hats were created by Jesper Rabe Tonnesen, a vintage clothing store owner in Copenhagen. At first, the idea failed, with early batches last year drawing little interest.That changed after the Trump administration recently stepped up its rhetoric over Greenland. Since then, the caps have appeared widely at protests and online.“When a delegation from America went up to Greenland, we started to realize this probably wasn’t a joke -- it’s not reality TV, it’s actually reality,” said Tonnesen, 58. “So I said, OK, what can I do? Can I communicate in a funny way with a good message and unite the Danes to show that Danish people support the people of Greenland?”Demand quickly jumped from almost nothing to selling out within a single weekend. Tonnesen said he has now ordered “several thousand” more.The first version of the cap designed by Tonnesen carried a wordplay slogan, “Nu det NUUK!” a twist on the Danish phrase “Nu det nok,” meaning “Now it’s enough,” replacing the word with Nuuk, Greenland’s small capital.At Saturday’s rally, protesters waved red-and-white Danish and Greenlandic flags and held handmade signs mocking US claims over the territory, which is slightly larger than Saudi Arabia","Protesters in Denmark have taken to the streets to oppose US President Donald Trump’s push to acquire Greenland.

'Trump Still A Friend': Netanyahu Publicly Opposes U.S. Board Of Peace For Gaza Governance





Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday issued a stern warning to Iran’s Khamenei-led regime, vowing an “unprecedented” response if Tehran attacks Israel, Xinhua reported.Addressing the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, Netanyahu said, “If it makes a mistake and attacks us, we will act with a force it has not yet known.”He said Israel was “closely” monitoring Iran, cautioning that “no one can predict what the future holds for Iran, but it will not return to what it once was,” a remark suggesting irreversible consequences for Tehran in the event of a conflict.The comments came as the United States was reportedly moving the nuclear-powered USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group toward the Middle East amid escalating tensions with Iran.Separately, Netanyahu addressed US-led proposals for Gaza’s post-war governance, under which Turkish and Qatari officials have been cited as potential participants in the US President Donald Trump-chaired “Board of Peace.”“We have a certain disagreement with our friends in the United States over the composition of the advisory board that will accompany the processes in Gaza,” Netanyahu said, adding that neither Turkish nor Qatari soldiers would be permitted to operate in the enclave.Israel has consistently opposed any Turkish role in Gaza and maintains uneasy ties with Qatar, despite Turkey and Qatar being among the key mediators between Israel and Hamas.","'If it makes a mistake and attacks us, we will act with a force it has not yet known,' Netanyahu says.

Iran Broadcast Breached: State TV Hacked As Opposition Airs Reza Pahlavi Protest Message Nationwide

State TV satellite broadcast disrupted

Crackdown death toll rises sharply

Fears of executions and a police ultimatum

International backlash and Davos snub

US aircraft carrier movement raises tensions





Iran is facing one of its gravest crises in decades as nationwide protests, a deadly crackdown by authorities, cyber disruptions to state television and rising international pressure converge amid an ongoing internet shutdown.Activists say the death toll from the unrest has crossed 4,000, while tensions between Tehran and Washington remain elevated.Hackers disrupted Iranian state television satellite transmissions, briefly airing footage supporting exiled crown prince Reza Pahlavi and urging security forces not to “point your weapons at the people,” online videos showed early Monday, as per news agency AP.The footage appeared across multiple satellite-broadcast channels of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting and included clips of security personnel, claiming some had laid down their weapons.The semiofficial Fars news agency acknowledged the signal disruption in “some areas of the country,” but did not specify what was broadcast.Pahlavi’s office confirmed the appearance of the footage but did not comment on the hacking.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said at least 4,029 people have been killed in the crackdown on protests, with fears the toll could rise further as information emerges despite the internet shutdown, according to AP.Of those killed, 3,786 were demonstrators, 180 security personnel, 28 children and 35 non-protesters. The agency also said more than 26,000 people have been arrested.Iranian officials have not released an official death toll. Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the protests had left “several thousand” people dead and blamed the United States.Concerns have grown over possible executions of detainees. Iran’s top police officer Ahmad-Reza Radan issued an ultimatum to protesters deemed “deceived,” asking them to surrender within three days for leniency or face severe punishment, reported news agency AFP.A joint statement from Iran’s president, judiciary chief and parliament speaker said that while “killers and seditious terrorists will be punished,” leniency would be shown to those misled into participating.Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi had his invitation to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos withdrawn due to the killings. “It is not right for the Iranian government to be represented at Davos this year,” the forum said, as per AP.Araghchi denounced the move, alleging political pressure. The Munich Security Conference also withdrew invitations for Iranian officials.Amid rising tensions, ship-tracking data analysed by AP showed the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier entering the Strait of Malacca, potentially en route to the Middle East.The USS Abraham Lincoln was stationed in the South China Sea with its strike group to deter China amid rising tensions with Taiwan.Now, the tracking data shows that the USS Frank E Petersen Jr, USS Michael Murphy, and USS Spruance, all guided missile destroyers, are accompanying the Lincoln through the strait.Multiple US media reports from anonymous officials say the Lincoln, which is based in San Diego, is heading to the Middle East. It will take several days before its aircraft are within range of that region.Currently, the Middle East does not have an aircraft carrier group or an amphibious ready group, which complicates any talks about a military operation against Iran, especially since Gulf Arab states generally oppose such an attack.Earlier, US President Donald Trump warned Tehran against killing peaceful protesters or carrying out mass executions following the unrest. However, he thanked the Iranian authorities recently for cancelling the hangings of the protestors.Iran remains under heavy security, with limited internet access, as authorities struggle to contain the fallout from the deadliest unrest the country has seen in decades.","Activists say the death toll from the unrest has crossed 4,000, while tensions between Tehran and Washington remain elevated.

Trump's Vow To 'CAPTURE Greenland' In Chilling Letter After Norway's Nobel SNUB Stuns NATO | Watch





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday changed his long-standing stance on Nobel Prize , and said that he ""did not care"" about the peace prize. This comes only a day after he wrote to the Norway PM in which he had that said he no longer felt bound to “think purely of Peace” on Greenland after the Nobel Committee’s decision not to award him the prize.Up until now, the US president had repeatedly insisted that he deserved the award and even campaigned for it last year, claiming credit for helping resolve “eight wars.”“I don't care about the Nobel Prize. First of all, a very fine woman felt that I deserved it and really wanted me to have the Nobel Prize, and I appreciate that. If anybody thinks that Norway doesn't control the Nobel Prize, they are just kidding,” Trump told a reporter.Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado presented Trump with her Nobel Peace Prize medal last week, an award she was conferred months ago.In the letter Monday, Trump said, “Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a “right of ownership” anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you! President DJT.”Norwegian PM Støre responded, emphasising that the Nobel Peace Prize decision does not rest with the Norwegian government.Trump’s letter to Støre comes after a series of public statements in which he accused Denmark of failing to counter what he describes as a Russian security threat in the Arctic.","US President Donald Trump changed his long-standing stance on Nobel Prize, and said that he ""did not care"" about the peace prize.

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday launched extensive raids at 21 locations across Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu as part of its investigation into alleged money laundering linked to the Sabarimala gold smuggling case.Searches are underway at the residences of all accused named in the case and at institutions connected to them, according to news agency ANI.ED teams have begun raids at the homes of key accused, including Unnikrishnan Potti, former Devaswom Board President A Padmakumar, N Vasu, Murari Babu, and gold traders Govardhan and Pankaj Bhandari. Searches are also being carried out at Smart Creations in Chennai and at the residence of Bellary-based gold trader Govardhan.In Kerala, ED teams have reached the Devaswom Board headquarters in Thiruvananthapuram. Raids are ongoing at Murari Babu's residence in Kottayam, Unnikrishnan Potti's house at Pulimath near Kilimanoor, N Vasu's residence at Pettah, and A Padmakumar's house in Aranmula. The ED has also begun searches at the residence of Unnikrishnan Potti's sister in Valiyakattakkal, Venganoor, and at the Thiruvananthapuram homes of K P Shankaradas, N Vijayakumar, and S Baiju.The searches are being conducted under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), with the ED probing financial transactions linked to the Sabarimala gold smuggling case to determine whether large-scale money laundering occurred.While a Special Investigation Team (SIT) is probing the gold smuggling case under the supervision of the Kerala High Court, the ED has initiated a parallel investigation focusing exclusively on the money trail. ED has registered an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR), naming all accused included by the SIT, including Thantri Kandaru Rajeevar, though no search has been conducted at the Thantri's residence so far.The ED has booked more than 15 accused in the case, with Unnikrishnan Potti listed as the prime accused. Former Devaswom Board President A Padmakumar, N Vasu, and others are also among those named.Unnikrishnan Potti was taken into custody by the SIT in October last year in the Sabarimala gold theft case.According to officials, the ED may move to attach assets in the coming days based on the outcome of the raids. The agency's intelligence wing had initiated a preliminary inquiry soon after the SIT probe began, following inputs suggesting large-scale money laundering linked to the gold smuggling.Earlier, documents, including FIRs and the accused's statements, were handed over to the ED by the Kollam Vigilance Court, overriding objections raised by the state government. While it was argued that a parallel probe could affect the confidentiality of the court-monitored SIT investigation, the court upheld the ED's authority to investigate under the PMLA.Apart from the existing accused, former minister and CPI(M) leader Kadakampally Surendran may also fall within the ED's ambit of investigation.The Sabarimala gold theft case concerns allegations of the misappropriation of approximately 4.54 kilograms of gold from sacred temple artefacts, including the Sreekovil (sanctum sanctorum) door frames and Dwarapalaka idols. The theft allegedly occurred in 2019 under the pretext of refinishing and re-gold-plating temple structures.The controversy traces its origins to a 1998 donation by industrialist Vijay Mallya, who had gifted 30.3 kilograms of gold and 1,900 kilograms of copper for gold plating and cladding work at the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple. Subsequent inspections and court-monitored inquiries revealed discrepancies between the donated gold and the quantity allegedly used.","ED teams have begun raids at the homes of key accused, including Unnikrishnan Potti, former Devaswom Board President A Padmakumar, N Vasu, Murari Babu, and gold traders Govardhan and Pankaj Bhandari.

Rao denies charges, calls videos ‘fabricated’

Complaints to PMO, DoPT; audio clips add twist

Opposition ups pressure

Past controversies resurface







BENGALURU: Karnataka DGP (Civil Rights Enforcement) K Ramachandra Rao was suspended on Monday night after the state government ordered a probe into unverified sleaze videos allegedly showing the senior IPS officer in intimate acts with women inside his office.Chief minister Siddaramaiah said disciplinary action would follow a detailed inquiry.Read more: Karnataka DGP Ramachandra Rao under fire: 'Sleaze' video, suspension and shadow of Ranya Rao gold smuggling case — what we know “We will take action. No one is above the law, however senior the officer may be,” the CM said in Badami, adding that he became aware of the matter earlier in the day and had directed a probe.The suspension came hours after purported videos went viral on social media, triggering political outrage and a flurry of complaints to both state and central authorities. The source and authenticity of the videos remain unverified, and the state government said they would be examined as part of the inquiry.Rao rejected the allegations outright, calling the videos “fabricated, false and aimed at maligning me and scuttling my career”. He told reporters that his attempts to meet home minister G Parameshwara did not fructify and suggested the footage could relate to his posting in Belagavi nearly eight years ago.“I will consult my advocate and take appropriate legal action,” he said.The government has sought a report from the home department. Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar said he was unaware of the details and referred queries to the CM and the home minister.As the controversy escalated, social activist and Ballari-based Anna Foundation chief Rajshekar Mulali wrote to the Prime Minister’s Office and the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), seeking legal action against Rao for alleged misuse of power, public office and police uniform, and for showing “disrespect to national and state symbols”.Another activist, Dinesh Kallahalli, filed a complaint with the chief secretary and additional chief secretary, demanding Rao’s suspension and disciplinary action under the All India Services (Discipline & Appeal) Rules, 1969.Late Monday evening, two audio clips also surfaced on social media, purportedly featuring a conversation between a police officer and a woman. Their authenticity could not be independently verified. The circulation of the audio, alongside the videos, further fuelled political and public outrage.Senior BJP MLA and former law minister S Suresh Kumar termed the alleged acts “an unforgivable crime” that cast a shadow over the credibility of the police force, pointing to the tricolour visible in the background of the video as a sign of disrespect to the national flag. Opposition leaders accused the government of shielding the officer and demanded an independent probe.Women and Child Development Minister Laxmi Hebbalkar said the government would act “mercilessly, irrespective of seniority” if wrongdoing was established.Rao, who is also the stepfather of Kannada actor Harshavardhini Ranya alias Ranya Rao has faced scrutiny earlier in his career. Opposition leaders cited previous controversies to argue for swift and strict action.The state government said the authenticity of the videos and audio clips will be verified and that further action will depend on the outcome of the inquiry.","Karnataka DGP (Civil Rights Enforcement) K Ramachandra Rao was suspended on Monday night.

Iran WARNS Trump’s Attack On Khamenei Would Trigger JIHAD, Top General Says ‘Will Chop Off...’





United States President Donald Trump on Tuesday said America would wipe out Iran if the Islamic nation assassinates him.""I have very firm instructions — anything happens, they're going to wipe them off the face of this earth,"" Trump said in an interview on NewsNation's “Katie Pavlich Tonight”.Trump's remark came hours after Iran warned him not to take any action against the country's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Earlier, the US president had called for an end to Khamenei's nearly 40-year reign.""Trump knows that if any hand of aggression is extended toward our leader, we not only cut that hand but also we will set fire to their world,"" General Abolfazl Shekarchi, a spokesperson for Iran's armed forces, said, according to news agency AP.Earlier, in a weekend interview, Trump described Khamenei as a “sick man” and openly called for regime change. “It’s time to look for new leadership in Iran,” Trump told Politico, urging the leadership to “stop killing people.”Tensions between Washington and Tehran have been high since nationwide protests broke out on December 28, driven by Iran’s deepening economic crisis. The demonstrations were met with a harsh crackdown by authorities.Trump has said the United States has drawn two red lines: the killing of peaceful protesters and the risk of mass executions in the aftermath of the unrest.A government-imposed internet blackout since January 8 has made it difficult to verify the true scale of the violence. However, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said on Tuesday that at least 4,519 people have been killed.On Saturday, Khamenei acknowledged the bloodshed for the first time, saying “several thousand” had died, though he blamed the violence on US interference. His remarks marked the first public admission by Iran’s leadership of the scale of the casualties.Meanwhile, national police chief Gen Ahmad Reza Radan announced a three-day window for what he described as “deceived” youth to surrender, promising leniency for those who turn themselves in for their role in the unrest.","U.S. President Donald Trump said America would wipe out Iran if the Islamic nation assassinates him.

The President and team will board a different aircraft and continue on to Switzerland,” the post said.The two planes has been serving as presidential vehicle -- Air Force One in service for nearly four decades. Boeing has been developing replacements, but the program has hit by multiple delays.Last year, Qatar's ruling family gifted Trump a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet to join the Air Force One fleet, a move that drew major scrutiny.The plane is currently being retrofitted to meet security requirements.Leavitt joked to reporters on Air Force One Tuesday night that the Qatari jet was ""sounding much better"" at the moment.The aircraft was expected to land at Joint Base Andrews around 11 pm (local time).Trump was scheduled to meet several global leaders in Davos and had earlier described the Switzerland visit as an “interesting trip.” “I have no idea what’s going to happen, but you are well represented,” he said before departure.Last February, an Air Force aircraft carrying secretary of state Marco Rubio to Germany was forced to return to Washington after a mechanical problem.In October, a military plane transporting defence secretary Pete Hegseth made an emergency landing in the United Kingdom due to a cracked windshield.","US President Donald Trump's designated aircraft, Air Force One, made a sharp U-turn and returned to Joint Base Andrews on Tuesday.

Macron EXPLODES At Trump’s ‘UNWANTED & CRAZY’ Greenland Threats After Leaked Chats | Watch





French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday hit back at his American counterpart Donald Trump after the latter shared a screenshot of their private conversation on social media, saying he “stands by his words” and that Europe would not yield to bullies or be intimidated, referring to Trump's constant demand to absorb Greenland in the US.Responding to questions about the leak, Macron said he took full responsibility for his actions and remarks. “I take responsibility for everything I do. I tend to be consistent in what I say in public and in what I do in private,” he said.Asked whether he would meet Trump on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Macron ruled it out, explaining that he would have left by the time the US president arrived.Macron also dismissed reports of a G7 summit being scheduled this week. “No meeting is scheduled. The French presidency is willing to hold one,” he told news agency AFP in Switzerland's Davos.While other European leaders struck a cautious tone to avoid escalating the transatlantic rift, French President Emmanuel Macron took a far more confrontational stand.Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Macron said France and Europe would not “passively accept the law of the strongest,” warning that doing so would amount to “vassalisation.” He stressed that Europe would continue to defend territorial sovereignty and the rule of law, even as the world, in his words, shifts toward “a rules-free order.” This, he said, could include the European Union responding with tough trade sanctions of its own.“We prefer respect to bullies,” Macron said. “And we prefer the rule of law to brutality.”Macron’s remarks came after US President Trump threatened steep tariffs on French wine and champagne and posted private messages exchanged with the French leader -- an unusual breach of diplomatic protocol.A day earlier, Trump had shared details of a private conversation with Macron on Truth Social, launched a sharp personal attack saying the French president “will be out of office soon,” and after being told that Macron was unwilling to join his proposed “board of peace.”","French President Emmanuel Macron hit back at his American counterpart Donald Trump after the latter shared a screenshot of their private conversation on social media.

Warnings of a return to colonial-era power politics – and unusually blunt language – dominated discussions at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday as global leaders reacted to US President Donald Trump’s renewed push to seize Greenland and impose related trade tariffs, according to the AP.The annual gathering comes amid heightened tensions over global trade and security, with Trump’s stance on Greenland unsettling European allies and middle powers alike. While the US president is not scheduled to address the forum until Wednesday, his policies loomed large over debates in Davos.French president Emmanuel Macron cautioned against what he described as a dangerous shift in global order. Warning of “a new colonial approach,” Macron said such moves risked undermining decades of international cooperation.“It’s a shift towards a world without rules. Where international law is trampled underfoot and where the only law that seems to matter is that of the strongest, and imperial ambitions are resurfacing,” he said.Macron also criticised US trade practices, denouncing “competition from the United States of America, through trade agreements that undermine our export interests… combined with an endless accumulation of new tariffs that are fundamentally unacceptable.”The strongest language, however, came from California governor Gavin Newsom, who addressed European leaders in the forum’s entrance hall.“I can’t take this complicity. People rolling over. I should’ve brought a bunch of knee pads for all the world leaders,” Newsom said.“I hope people understand how pathetic they look on the world stage… from an American perspective, it’s embarrassing.”Referring directly to Trump, Newsom added, “Diplomacy with Donald Trump? He’s a T-Rex. You mate with him or he devours you. One or the other… Wake up! Where the hell has everybody been? Stop with this (expletive) diplomacy sort of niceties… Have some spine, some goddamn (expletive).”Canadian prime minister Mark Carney urged countries outside the top tier of global power to deepen cooperation rather than compete for favour.“Great powers can afford for now to go it alone. They have the market size, the military capacity, and the leverage to dictate terms. Middle powers do not,” he said. “In a world of great power rivalry… if we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu.”Carney also rejected US ambitions in the Arctic, saying, “We stand firmly with Greenland and Denmark and fully support their unique right to determine Greenland’s future.”With Trump absent, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent sought to calm tensions, playing down the rift with Europe. “I think our relations have never been closer,” Bessent said. “Calm down the hysteria. Take a deep breath.”He added that while disagreements existed over Greenland, “Europe is an ally, the US-NATO membership is unquestioned.”Belgian prime minister Bart De Wever warned that Trump’s rhetoric had crossed multiple red lines in Europe. “Being a happy vassal is one thing. Being a miserable slave is something else,” he said, cautioning that backing down now would mean “you’re going to lose your dignity.”European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said escalating trade disputes risked weakening the West. “The proposed additional tariffs are a mistake, especially between long-standing allies,” she said, adding: “In politics, as in business, a deal is a deal.”If US policy shifts proved permanent, she said, “then Europe must change permanently too,” calling for a more independent Europe while stressing that a diplomatic “downward spiral” would only embolden adversaries.The renewed push for Greenland by Trump and approach to trade, and alliances has created a growing unease among US allies as once again tests the post-war transatlantic order.(With inputs from agency)","French president Emmanuel Macron warns of a dangerous shift in global order.

— Mel (@Villgecrazylady) January 18, 2026 A casual lunch turned into a frightening ordeal for five software engineers in Minneapolis last week after they were mistakenly labelled as federal immigration agents and confronted by an angry crowd outside the restaurant where they were dining. The incident, which took place at Clancy’s Deli near 38th Street and Grand Avenue South, highlights the heightened tensions over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in the Twin Cities as protests and community unrest escalate.According to accounts obtained by Alpha News, the group of software engineers, all white males dressed casually, were quietly eating lunch when one of the men received a message on an anti-ICE Signal chat group claiming that plainclothes ICE agents were inside the restaurant.

In this climate, misinformation and real-time alerts from activist networks can spark rapid, sometimes volatile public responses, as seen in the Clancy’s Deli episode. Anti-ICE protester groups have been mobilising quickly via encrypted messaging apps to track and confront perceived federal agents but incidents like this highlight the risk of misidentification and escalation when tensions run high.

The software engineers involved described mixed political views within their group, with some identifying as anti-ICE and others as neutral or supportive of immigration enforcement, underscoring the unpredictable consequences of such confrontations. Lee said the incident has forced some in the group to rethink their positions amid the volatile local climate.

What comes next

As Minneapolis grapples with ongoing protests, federal enforcement actions and community divisions, this episode serves as a stark reminder of how quickly everyday situations can spiral into dangerous confrontations. Local authorities have been balancing enforcement with public safety protocols, including a recent federal court ruling limiting the arrest powers of DHS agents against peaceful protesters, underscoring both legal and social complexities in the region.

What began as a quiet lunch for a group of tech workers has become another headline in a city struggling with deep divisions over immigration policies, law enforcement presence and citizen activism. Whether viewed as a cautionary tale about misinformation or a symptom of escalating public distrust in federal agencies, the incident has captured public attention and sparked debate over protest tactics, civil liberties and community safety.





The incident is not isolated; it comes amid a broader wave of anti-ICE activism and backlash in Minneapolis triggered by increased federal immigration enforcement. Earlier this month, the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent during an enforcement operation drew national attention, intensifying community anger and protest activity throughout the city.Social media reaction to the incident was swift and sharply divided, with the story igniting fierce debate across X (formerly Twitter), Reddit and conservative and progressive forums alike. Critics of the protesters described the confrontation as a chilling example of “mob justice”, warning that viral Signal alerts and online callouts are increasingly putting ordinary civilians at risk based on assumptions alone.Many users expressed alarm at how quickly a false accusation escalated into public harassment, with some calling it a failure of crowd restraint and accountability in activist spaces. On the other side, some anti-ICE voices argued that heightened vigilance was a byproduct of aggressive immigration enforcement and mistrust of authorities, though even among them, several conceded that misidentification and intimidation crossed a line.While one X user commented, ""Five random White guys eating lunch in Minnesota get reported as “undercover ICE agents” to an anti-ICE Signal chat by the restaurant’s owner and the next thing they know a mob has showed up to accost them. And because Minneapolis has a “no cooperation with ICE policy” the local police are avoiding situations like this altogether- leaving regular citizens to fend for themselves and deal with these psychotic gangs of social justice warriors (sic)"", another wrote, ""It is a Maoist cultural revolution. Citizens forced into struggle sessions by the Democratic Red Guard (sic)"" and yet another tweeted, ""“…the encounter left some of them reconsidering their positions.” I would certainly hope so. If not, I don’t know what it would take (sic).""The episode has since become a flashpoint in the broader online debate over protest culture, misinformation, and whether social media–fuelled rapid-response activism is eroding basic norms of due process and personal safety.Minneapolis has become a flashpoint in the nationwide debate over immigration enforcement. Federal operations known as Operation Metro Surge have deployed thousands of immigration agents in the region, resulting in widespread protests, legal battles, and public safety concerns. The broader atmosphere has become fraught, with immigrant communities and local residents voicing strong opposition to ICE tactics and federal intervention.","Five software engineers were mistakenly labelled as federal immigration agents and confronted by an angry crowd outside the restaurant where they were dining.

NATO Surrenders Before Trump? ‘Only 34 Troops To Defend Greenland From US…’ | Shock Announcement





US President Donald Trump has written a blunt letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, linking the Nobel Committee’s decision not to award him the Nobel Peace Prize to his hardened stance on Greenland, saying he no longer feels bound to “think purely of Peace”.According to a copy of the letter obtained by Bloomberg, Trump’s message to the Norwegian leader — first reported by a PBS journalist on X — was circulated by the US National Security Council (NSC) to several other European governments, underscoring Washington’s intent to make the communication widely known.“Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a “right of ownership” anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.Thank you! President DJT,” Trump wrote according to Bloomberg.Reacting to the letter, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said Trump’s message was sent in response to a brief text message he had earlier conveyed to the US President.“Trump’s message came in response to a short text message to President Trump from me earlier in the day, on behalf of myself and the President of Finland, Alexander Stubb,” Støre said.Støre underlined that Trump had been repeatedly informed that the Nobel Peace Prize decision does not rest with the Norwegian government.“I have repeatedly clearly explained to Trump that it is an independent committee that awards the Nobel Peace Prize,” he said.Norway had expressed disbelief last week after Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado handed her medal to US President Donald Trump, who has long coveted the award. Trump, who has repeatedly claimed he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for resolving multiple conflicts during his second term, accepted the medal during a meeting with the Venezuelan opposition leader at the White House.The move prompted a swift clarification from the Norwegian Nobel Committee.“The Nobel Prize and the laureate are inseparable,” the committee said in a statement on Friday. “Even if the medal or diploma later comes into someone else’s possession, this does not alter who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.”Trump’s letter to Norway PM follows a series of public statements in which he has accused Denmark of failing to counter what he describes as a Russian security threat in the Arctic.Earlier on Sunday, Trump said Denmark had not been able to do anything to remove the “Russian threat” from Greenland and added, “Now it is time, and it will be done!!!”“NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that ‘you have to get Russian threat away from Greenland.’ Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it,” Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social.Trump has repeatedly said he will settle for nothing less than ownership of Greenland, an autonomous territory that remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark.Leaders in both Denmark and Greenland have firmly rejected Trump’s position, insisting the island is not for sale and that Greenlanders do not wish to become part of the United States.The pressure campaign has also taken on an economic dimension. On Saturday, Trump vowed to impose a wave of escalating tariffs on European allies until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland.","US President Donald Trump has written a blunt letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.

Parts of Russia’s Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula are reeling under extreme and record-breaking snowfall, with powerful winter storms dumping several metres of snow and bringing daily life to a near standstill.Footage has emerged showing heavy snowfall in Russia that lasted for four days without interruption, blanketing residential areas, roads and buildings.In Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the capital of Kamchatka Krai, road conditions remain “critical” after a series of storms battered the region with snow, ice and strong winds, reported The Moscow Times.Meteorologists said the level of snowfall recorded since early January has not been seen in more than 50 years. As per The Moscow Times, the average snow height in the city has reached around 170 cm, with drifts exceeding 2.5 metres in some neighbourhoods.In some areas, drifts have risen several metres high, blocking building entrances and burying cars almost completely.People were seen digging out their cars after a powerful snowstorm dumped several feet of snow across parts of Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula, as visuals showed locals carving paths through towering snowbanks.Russian children were also seen enjoying the unusual conditions, sliding on snow piled up near multistorey buildings, while residents in some areas had fun snow-gliding and diving into massive drifts.The current record-breaking snowfall in Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula has seen drifts reach up to five metres (16 feet).City authorities declared a state of emergency after at least two elderly men were killed by snow falling from rooftops last week, as per The Moscow Times.Officials warned that icicles and heavy snow accumulation on roofs continue to pose serious risks, while prolonged snowfall has also raised avalanche concerns in residential areas.According to Reuters, Kamchatka has witnessed its heaviest snowfall in around 60 years, disrupting transport and forcing residents to adapt to extraordinary conditions.Life in the region remains severely affected as authorities race to clear roads and restore normal movement.","Parts of Russia’s Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula are reeling under extreme and record-breaking snowfall.

A Danish member of the European parliament delivered an unorthodox and profane rebuke to US President Donald Trump on Tuesday (local time), saying “Let me put this in words you might understand: Mr President. ..” during a session addressing Trump’s controversial outreach on Greenland’s future.Anders Vistisen, a Danish member of the European parliament, was immediately interrupted by the parliament vice president Nicolae Stefanuta, who reminded him that such language was prohibited in the chamber.“I’m sorry, colleague… we have clear rules about cuss words, language that is inappropriate in this room. I’m sorry to interrupt you but it is unacceptable, even if you might feel strongly about it,” the presiding chair said.The outburst came amid renewed tensions over Trump’s continued push to bring Greenland under American control in a bid to bolster what he says is a national and global security necessity.It comes as Trump recently shared a post tied to Greenland, including an altered image on his social media platform Truth Social showing a map of North America marked with the American flag over Greenland, Canada and Venezuela to depict expanded US territory.Another edited image depicted Trump, US state and war secretary planting a US flag in Greenland, labelled “US Territory Est 2026.”Vistisen, who represents the Danish People’s Party in the European Parliament, has previously addressed Trump on the subject.In a 2025 address, he stressed Greenland’s long historical ties to Denmark, noting that the island had been part of the Danish kingdom for some 800 years and saying “it is not for sale.” He followed that declaration with the same profanity-laden remark directed at Trump.Tuesday’s session focused on broader concerns about Greenland’s sovereignty and strategic positioning in global geopolitics, with Trump’s overtures drawing scrutiny from European lawmakers who view the Arctic territory’s status as non-negotiable.The Danish lawmaker’s comment reflects growing frustration among European representatives over Trump’s public pressure on the issue. Trump has asserted that Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory of strategic importance in the Arctic, is critical to US national security and has even floated the idea of potential US acquisition, measures that have drawn sharp criticism from Denmark and its allies.","Anders Vistisen, a Danish member of the European parliament, was immediately interrupted by the parliament vice president Nicolae Stefanuta.

LIVE: Canadian PM Mark Carney Special Address at Davos WEF 2026





Canadian prime minister Mark Carney on Tuesday said the rules-based order, a concept that took shape after World War II, has been ""partially false"" and a ""fiction"" as the strongest country would ""exempt themselves when convenient"".Stripping off the charade of the rules-based order, Carney said: ""International law (was) applied with varying rigour depending on the identity of the accused or the victim.""""We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false — that the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient, that trade rules were enforced asymmetrically, and that international law applied with varying rigour depending on the identity of the accused or the victim,"" Carney said in a strong-worded address at World Economic Forum in Davos.In a major confession from a Western leader against the unbridled and unchecked American hegemony, the Canadian PM said the Western nations ""avoided calling out the gaps between rhetoric and reality"" as the American hegemony helped provide public goods.Calling claimed ""neutrality"" and equal rule-application within that order a fiction, Carney said:""It was useful, and American hegemony, in particular, helped provide public goods: open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security, and support for frameworks for resolving disputes.""He further said: ""So we placed the sign in the window. We participated in the rituals. And we largely avoided calling out the gaps between rhetoric and reality. This bargain no longer works.Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.""Carney, without naming US president Donald Trump , who have been hostile towards Canada ever before assuming office a year ago, tore into the Republican leader, saying: ""You cannot live within the lie of mutual benefit through integration when integration becomes the source of your subordination.""""Over the past two decades a series of crises in finance, health, energy, and geopolitics have laid bare the risks of extreme global integration. But more recently, great powers have begun using economic integration as a weapon. Tariffs are leverage, financial infrastructure is coercion, and supply chains have vulnerabilities to be exploited,"" the Canadian PM said.Carney’s remarks come against the backdrop of renewed disruption caused by Donald Trump’s foreign-policy posture, particularly his fixation on Greenland. Trump’s revived demand for greater US control over Greenland has unsettled Nato allies and deepened anxiety in Europe, where the move is seen as undermining sovereignty and alliance norms.The issue has sharpened tensions between Washington and European capitals, reinforcing concerns that power, rather than rules, increasingly defines Western decision-making.Carney’s comments also reflect Canada’s direct exposure to Trump's coercive tactics. Ottawa has faced repeated tariff threats, trade pressure, and inflammatory rhetoric, including Trump’s past suggestion that Canada could become a US state.Similar pressure has been applied to allies such as France, particularly through trade and defence disputes. In this context, Carney’s critique frames economic integration not as mutual benefit but as leverage, arguing that the old bargain of silence in return for stability has collapsed under a more transactional and confrontational American approach.","Canadian PM Mark Carney said the rules-based order, a concept that took shape after World War II, has been ""partially false"" and a ""fiction"" as the strongest country would ""exempt themselves when convenient"" In a major confession from a Western leader against the unbridled and unchecked American hegemony, the Canadian PM said Western nations ""avoided calling out the gaps between rhetoric and reality""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126916463,imgsize-245882,width-400,resizemode-4/switzerland-davos.jpg"

Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance announced Tuesday, January 20, that they are expecting their fourth child, a baby boy, sharing the news in an Instagram post that said both mother and child are healthy.The announcement, made by the vice president and his wife on social media, said the baby is due in late July. JD and Usha Vance are already parents to three children, Ewan, 8, Vivek, 5, and Mirabel, 4.“We’re very excited to share the news that Usha is pregnant with our fourth child, a boy. Usha and the baby are doing well, and we are all looking forward to welcoming him in late July,” the Instagram post read.ID@undefinedCaption not available.The couple also acknowledged the support they have received while balancing public office and family life. “During this exciting and hectic time, we are particularly grateful for the military doctors who take excellent care of our family and for the staff members who do so much to ensure that we can serve the country while enjoying a wonderful life with our children,” the post added.At 40, Usha Vance becomes the first vice presidential spouse to be pregnant while her husband is in office.She is also the youngest woman to serve as second lady since Jane Hadley Barkley, the wife of Vice President Alben Barkley, who assumed the role in 1949 during the Truman administration.The pregnancy announcement also puts to rest recent speculation about the state of the couple’s marriage. In late 2025, a wave of tabloid-style headlines surfaced after Usha Vance was photographed without her wedding ring, prompting unfounded rumors about marital trouble.A spokesperson for the second lady later dismissed the claims, saying, “[Usha is] a mother of three young children, who does a lot of dishes, gives lots of baths, and forgets her ring sometimes.”Vance addressed similar rumors himself in a December interview with NBC News, saying he and Usha “kind of get a kick out of it” and stressing that their marriage is “as strong as it's ever been.”JD Vance has repeatedly spoken about the importance of raising children during his political career. Addressing the crowd at the 2025 March for Life, he said, “Let me say very simply: I want more babies in the United States of America.” He added, “I want more happy children in our country, and I want beautiful young men and women who are eager to welcome them into the world and eager to raise them.”","Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance are expecting their fourth child.
