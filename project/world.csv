Nations that ‘failed demonstrably’

Trump’s warning to China





Taliban’s role in Afghanistan drug trade





US President Donald Trump has identified China, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and 19 other nations as major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries, warning that their activities threaten the safety of the United States.In asubmitted to Congress on Monday, Trump listed these countries as sources or routes for illicit drugs entering the United States.According to the White House, Trump delivered the “Major’s List” to Congress, designating these countries as responsible for sourcing and transporting illicit drugs into the US, reported PTI.The state department clarified that inclusion on the list does not necessarily reflect a government’s cooperation or counternarcotics work. It said the designation is based on “the combination of geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs or precursor chemicals to be transited or produced, even if a government has engaged in robust and diligent narcotics control and law enforcement measures. ”According to the White House, these countries are either sources of illicit drug production or serve as major transit points for trafficking into the US.The state department said five countries – Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, and Venezuela – have “failed demonstrably to make substantial efforts” to meet international counternarcotics obligations.It also clarified that inclusion on the list “does not necessarily reflect a government’s counterdrug efforts or level of cooperation with the United States,” but is based on geographic and economic factors that enable drug flows.Trump singled out China as the “world's largest source” of precursor chemicals used in illicit fentanyl production. He said China is also a major supplier of synthetic narcotics including nitazenes and methamphetamine.“The Chinese leadership can and must take stronger and sustained action to cut down these chemical flows and prosecute the drug criminals facilitating them,” Trump said.On Afghanistan, Trump said the Taliban’s announced ban on drugs has not stopped ongoing production and stockpiles of narcotics.“Revenue from this drug trade funds transnational criminal groups and supports international terrorists. Some members of the Taliban continue to profit from this trade, and I am once again designating Afghanistan as having failed demonstrably to uphold its drug control obligations,” he said.Trump added that trafficking of fentanyl and other deadly illicit drugs has created a national emergency. “Transnational organised crime's trafficking of fentanyl and other deadly illicit drugs into the US has created a national emergency, including a public health crisis that remains the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18 to 44,” he said, as quoted by PTI.","US President Donald Trump has identified China, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and 19 other nations as major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries.

Sanitation worker dies in bid to save 1 from manhole,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sanitation-worker-dies-in-bid-to-save-1-from-manhole/articleshow/123960509.cms,"'No mask, oxygen or even cloth given to cover face'

NEW DELHI: A labourer, 40, died and two of his colleagues are critical after being sent into a manhole to repair and clean it in northwest Delhi's Ashok Vihar Phase-II late on Tuesday night. None of them had any safety equipment.When the first worker collapsed after inhaling poisonous fumes, another went in to save him and died. The third, who tried to rescue the two, lost consciousness.Police called the manager of a company, which engaged the three on contractual basis, for questioning. They registered a case under several sections, including one banning manual scavenging.According to police, information about the people falling inside a sewer near Harihar apartments was received via a PCR call at Ashok Vihar police station at 11.30pm.""Arvind, along with three others, Sonu and Narayan, also from Kasganj, and Naresh from Bihar, entered a sewer as part of ongoing cleaning work when they fell unconscious, allegedly due to toxic gases,"" a senior police officer said.Arvind was rushed to DDU Hospital, where he was declared brought dead. The other two, Sonu(45) and Naresh (30) remain in critical condition in the ICU.At Deep Chand Babu Hospital's ICU ward, Narayan (32), one of the workers, told TOI, ""I was the one who opened the lid of the sewer that day,"" he said.""After that, Sonu was told to go inside. We had tied a rope around his waist, but no safety equipment was provided to him. He wasn't given any mask, no oxygen, not even a cloth to cover his face. He was just asked to go down and cut a pipe that was inside the sewer for some repair and cleaning work.""The moment Sonu cut the pipe, we saw him collapse. He just fell unconscious inside. To save him, Arvind immediately tied himself with the same rope and went in. But as soon as he reached down, he too fell unconscious. After that, Naresh tried to go in and bring them out, but the same thing happened to him. One after another, all three of them collapsed inside that sewer,"" Narayan said. ""I raised an alarm and shouted for help. Some locals gathered and together we somehow managed to pull them out with the rope. But by then all three were completely unconscious. They went in only to save each other. That's how we lost him.""Arvind was the sole breadwinner of his family, which includes his wife and two young sons aged 12 and 7. His daily earnings ranged between Rs 500 and Rs 800 and the family depended entirely on that income. For the past 15 years, he had been doing contractual work, often travelling to Delhi and taking up odd jobs. Sonu, too, is the only earning member in his family and supports his two sons, aged one-and-a-half and five.At the spot, the manhole on the busy residential stretch lay open the next day, access to it blocked only by a police barricade. Scattered around were the belongings of the workers, slippers, broken bluetooth headsets and a lone slipper floating inside the manhole's dirty sewer water. ""Preliminary inquiries revealed that the sewer cleaning work was underway for several days, carried out under the supervision of a construction company,"" police officer added.","A labourer, 40, died and two of his colleagues are critical after being sent into a manhole to repair and clean it in northwest Delhi's Ashok Vihar Phase-II late on Tuesday night.

Kash Patel to be fired for Charlie Kirk probe blunders?

FBI’s Kash Patel Stumbles After Charlie Kirk’s Assassination; ‘Botched’ Updates Trigger Backlash

Who is Andrew Bailey? 'I am not...'



Kash Patel's series of wrong moves in the Charlie Kirk incident



Patel announced that the suspect was in custody hours after Charlie Kirk was shot. Then he took back his statement and said the suspect was released. They actually got a wrong person. A day later, Patel flew from New York to Utah to join a press conference where he was seen with an FBI jacket like a field agent. It was called unprecedented for the FBI director. Despite his presence, which delayed the Thursday press conference, Patel did not speak as the suspect was not identified. Patel was present at the press conference where they announced the arrest of Tyler Robinson, but Utah Governor Spencer Cox spoke about the details of how he was caught, not Patel.





Amid speculations that Kash Patel should be removed as the FBI director, insider chatter claims that former Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who will be sworn in as a new deputy director of the FBI in a power-sharing role with Dan Bongino, will eventually replace Patel. Patel is believed to be on thin ice, though President Donald Trump praised his leadership and the FBI's investigation into the assassination of Charlie Kirk.Inside reports claim Trump is not thrilled with Patel, and the wrong arrest in connection with the Charlie Kirk murder was not the only reason. Patel's fallout with Pam Bondi over the Epstein case is where it all began. The White House, Bondi and her deputy, Todd Blanche, have no confidence in Kash Patel and Pam Bondi, in particular, cannot stand Patel, Fox reported, citing a source.Andrew Bailey was reportedly Trump's original choice to lead the FBI. As he will be sworn in today as the co-deputy director, there is speculation that he is a part of a broader plan that will place him in the position of Patel. Bailey issued a statement to Fox clarifying that he is not replacing Patel. ""Any suggestion that I was brought in to replace anyone in leadership at the FBI or spin my appointment into a sign of division, is simply false - I am honored to serve the FBI and Department of Justice as we work together to keep our nation safe,"" he said.Meanwhile in a separate but related development Kash Patel on Monday revealed a key development in the investigation into the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Patel said the agency has recovered a “text thread” in which the alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson, wrote that he had the chance to kill Kirk and planned to act out of “hatred that cannot be negotiated with.”","Andrew Bailey will be sworn in as co-deputy director of the FBI today.

‘Tariffs a mistake’: Bolton urges India-US talks; slams Donald Trump's 'incoherent' approach,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tariffs-a-mistake-bolton-urges-india-us-talks-slams-donald-trumps-incoherent-approach/articleshow/123948590.cms,"John Bolton (ANI)

US' Ex-NSA John Bolton: ‘Trump Should Call Modi, Fix Relations, And Visit India For QUAD Summit'

Former US national security advisor John Bolton said that the punitive tariffs imposed by the US on India under President Donald Trump have complicated negotiations. He described the US tariff policy on India as a mistake and said the priority should be reaching a deal that lowers tariffs while keeping negotiations open.""I think the whole tariff policy is a mistake. I think we ought to go back to the way we were before, but leaving that aside, in the time of Trump, in the White House. To get a deal that reduces the tariffs and leaves the way open for further negotiations is the best thing to do,"" Bolton said in an interview with TOI.He added that the focus should be on finding common ground on economic tariffs and then building from there.Bolton criticized the 25 percent US tariffs on India as collateral damage from broader Western sanctions on Russia, which were imposed over Russian oil and gas imports. He called the move “incoherent”, noting that Russia faced no direct tariffs and China, which imports more oil and gas than India, was left unpenalized.He also noted that India’s historical ties with Russia present challenges but argued for a gradual transition toward cooperation with like-minded partners.“I think we need to reduce purchases of Russia and oil and gas, and there are ways to do this to help transition India away from that in a way that's economically sound,” he said.He suggested that both sides should resume talks to reduce tariffs and rebuild trust, emphasizing the importance of personal rapport between leaders in fostering cooperation.“If the two leaders are now closer to being able to talk about it again that I think is a good sign I hope indicates progress,” he said, adding that a conversation between Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs to happen.On broader geopolitical concerns, Bolton highlighted the significance of closer collaboration between India, the US, Japan, and Australia through the Quad, particularly in countering China-Russia strategic alignment.He also said that he doesn’t think that Israel is committing genocide in the Gaza Strip.Bolton said Pakistan’s recent statement that Trump had no role in de-escalating tensions after the Kashmir attack highlights that the resolution was handled solely by India and Pakistan.""I think it's pretty remarkable that they would say that, and certainly, those who know a little bit about India know that from the similar agreements on forward, that's been the position that issues between Pakistan and India will be settled by the two of them. It's an example of how little Trump knows about,"" Bolton added.Bolton observed that Trump often seeks credit for international developments, citing the Nobel Peace Prize as a possible motivation.","Former US national security advisor John Bolton said that the punitive tariffs imposed by the US on India have complicated negotiations.

19 dead this year: 'Brain-eating' amoeba sparks political slugfest in Kerala House,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/19-dead-this-year-brain-eating-amoeba-sparks-political-slugfest-in-kerala-house/articleshow/123956442.cms,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The ""brain-eating"" parasitic infection amoebic meningoencephalitis has killed a three-month-old, a 52-year-old, and 17 others across Kerala this year. On Wednesday, grief turned into fury in the assembly, where opposition accused LDF government of presiding over a health system in free fall.Congress-led UDF moved an adjournment motion, saying 19 people had died this year from the rare infection, including Lathakumari of Thiruvananthapuram last week. The notice charged the government with ignoring awareness campaigns at local level, where those exposed to stagnant water are most at risk. It also flagged rising cases of jaundice, dengue, leptospirosis, typhoid and diarrhoeal diseases - calling the situation a ""collapse of public health management"".Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is rare. Globally, fewer than 500 cases have ever been reported. Yet Kerala has seen over 120 so far, including 68 this year. Infection occurs when contaminated freshwater enters the nose, letting the amoeba reach the brain through the sinus and destroy tissue.On Sept 1, an infant and a woman died while under treatment at Kozhikode Govt Medical College Hospital. ""We are providing the best possible treatment, including the imported drug miltefosine,"" principal KG Sajeeth Kumar had said, adding that both were infected by the same Naegleria fowleri strain.Govt has launched Jalamanu Jeevan (water is life), a statewide chlorination drive covering wells, swimming pools and tanks.Congress' VD Satheesan lashed out: ""Eight people died in 15 days. What is the protocol? What are people supposed to do? Even a baby was infected - was that child in a swimming pool?""Health minister Veena George hit back with a data-heavy defence, calling the charges a smear. ""Congress is trying to run down health sector. They say treatment outside govt hospitals is cheaper-who are they helping?""She highlighted Kerala's gains: infant mortality down from 12 during UDF's tenure to five today; liver transplants successful and free at Kottayam MCH; 13 district hospitals equipped with cath labs. She cited crisis response: ""When Nipah, with 70% fatality rate, struck, we brought it down to 33%."" But her repeated comparisons with UDF's record from a decade ago rang hollow to critics.Satheesan accused George of dodging accountability: ""Kerala's health is on a ventilator, yet the minister hides behind old numbers. From Rs 5,419 in 2016-17, per capita out-of-pocket health expense has risen to Rs 7,889 Instead of acting, state govt reacts after lives are lost.""","Amoebic meningoencephalitis has killed a three-month-old, a 52-year-old and 17 others across Kerala this year.

Screams, Chains, Panic: Inside ICE’s Biggest Worksite Raid; Hyundai Georgia Plant Turns 'War Zone'

A group of 56 Indian travellers was subjected to “most inhuman behaviour” by Georgian authorities while trying to enter the country from Armenia, a woman alleged in a viral social media post Tuesday.In a post on Instagram, user Dhruvee Patel said the group, despite holding valid e-visas and documents, faced humiliation and prolonged detention at the Sadakhlo border, the primary land crossing between Armenia and Georgia.She claimed they were “made to wait 5+ hrs in the freezing cold – no food, no toilet.” Patel further alleged that officials “confiscated passports for 2+ hrs with no communication” and forced the travellers to sit on the footpath “like cattle.”She said the authorities even recorded videos of them “like criminals” but stopped them from filming the incident. Their documents, she added, were not even checked, with officials simply declaring the visas “wrong.”Calling the treatment “shameful & unacceptable,” Patel tagged PM Modi and external affairs minister S Jaishankar in her post, writing, “India must take a strong stand.” She ended her post with a sharp rebuke: “This is how Georgia treats Indians. Shameful & unacceptable!”The post received mixed reactions online, with many Indians sharing similar ordeals.One user commented, “I’ve actually had so many civilised friends visit Georgia and had the same treatment… Trust me, it has nothing to do with civic sense or anything cause these girls were dressed very smartly, spoke softly and were extremely polite. The officials are just rude.”While one user remarked, “Depends. Were they squatting and eating Khakra at the airport while dancing to garba? Coz I have seen it!” another questioned, “When this behaviour has been consistent from Georgia then why do Indians keep going there.”A traveller who visited Georgia in 2019 shared a more mixed perspective. They recalled hearing similar stories before their trip but said they were eventually granted entry and went on to enjoy a “dream visit.” Still, they added, “from the last many years they are creating problems for Indians, that's a sad story.”","A group of 56 Indian travellers was subjected to “most inhuman behaviour” by Georgian authorities.

Victim rescued







NEW DELHI: Police in Maharashtra are searching for members of the family of dismissed IAS probationer Puja Khedkar after her father and his driver allegedly abducted a truck helper in a road rage incident near Navi Mumbai.The victim, Prahlad Kumar, 22, was bundled into an SUV after it brushed against a concrete mixer truck on the Mulund-Airoli Road last Saturday, police said.He was later rescued from the family’s bungalow in Pune.Officials identified the accused as Dilip Khedkar, a retired state government officer and Puja Khedkar’s father, and his bodyguard, Praful Salunkhe.The Navi Mumbai crime branch, running a parallel probe, is monitoring the family’s financial activities, checking ATM withdrawals, railway stations, toll booths and the family’s farmhouse in Pune. Immigration authorities have also been alerted.Rabale police said three teams have been camping in Pune for the past three days to track the suspects.Officials from Chatushrungi and Rabale police stations also visited the residence of Puja Khedkar on Tuesday to question her mother, Manorama. But she was not found.Senior inspector Uttam Bhajnawale of Chatushrungi police station told TOI, “None of the family members was present in their bungalow on Baner Road.Their caretakers answered our questions.”Police have accused Manorama Khedkar of helping the two men escape. According to officials, she refused to cooperate, promised to produce the accused at a police station but later backed out, ensured the car used in the abduction was removed, and unleashed “ferocious” dogs to scare a police team.“A Rabale police officer rang the bell and asked the watchman to call someone from the house. Manorama Khedkar came out but didn't open the gate. Police explained the purpose of their visit and sought her cooperation in tracing the two individuals and the car involved in the abduction case.

Jimmy Kimmel Live! pulled from ABC: Late-night show suspended indefinitely; backlash over Charlie Kirk remarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jimmy-kimmel-live-pulled-from-abc-late-night-show-suspended-indefinitely-backlash-over-charlie-kirk-remarks/articleshow/123959434.cms,"Utah Attorney Exposes Stunning Details About Kirk's Killer; 'Delete Texts & Stay Silent'





Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show has been pulled from ABC’s schedule after the host came under fire for remarks about the murder of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk . The network confirmed the decision on Wednesday, saying the programme would be “pre-empted indefinitely.” The move followed an announcement from Nexstar Media Group, which oversees dozens of ABC affiliates, that it would stop broadcasting the show in response to Kimmel’s comments.“Mr. Jimmy Kimmel’s comments about the death of Mr. Charlie Kirk are offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse, and we do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located,” said Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar’s broadcasting division. ABC confirmed the move, saying the show would be “pre-empted indefinitely. ”Trump celebrated ABC’s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live, calling it “Great News for America.” In a Truth Social post, Trump mocked Kimmel as “ratings challenged” and having “ZERO talent,” while praising ABC for “finally having the courage to do what had to be done.” He added, “That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC… Do it NBC!!!”Trump also pointed out Kimmel’s low ratings, saying they were “worse than even Colbert, if that’s possible.”During his Monday night monologue, Kimmel said: “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.” The comments sparked immediate backlash, with critics accusing Kimmel of insensitivity.Charlie Kirk, a prominent ally of President Donald Trump, was shot dead last week during a speaking event at Utah Valley University. Authorities said 22-year-old Tyler Robinson fired a rifle from a rooftop, killing Charlie Kirk with a single shot to the neck. Robinson has been charged with murder.Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr also condemned the remarks, calling them “some of the sickest conduct possible” in an interview with conservative podcaster Benny Johnson. He suggested the FCC could consider taking action against ABC affiliates, warning that broadcasters “have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest.” Carr said a suspension or even firing of Kimmel could be necessary, adding that “a public apology would be a very reasonable, minimal step. ”The White House also weighed in, with its social media account celebrating the suspension, saying: “They’re doing their viewers a favour. Jimmy is a sick freak.” Kimmel has long been a vocal critic of Trump, often using his late-night platform to target the former president and his supporters.Disney and ABC have not provided further details about the suspension, and Kimmel’s spokesperson has not responded to requests for comment. The move mirrors the recent cancellation of Stephen Colbert’s show on CBS, which the network insisted was for financial reasons, though critics linked it to his repeated attacks on Trump.","Kimmel came under fire for remarks about the murder of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.

Patriots that I am designating ANTIFA, A SICK, DANGEROUS, RADICAL LEFT DISASTER, AS A MAJOR TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. I will also be strongly recommending that those funding ANTIFA be thoroughly investigated in accordance with the highest legal standards and practices.

Singer David Anthony Burke, known as D4vd, was seen in the area where 15-year-old Celeste Rivas lived before her disappearance, TMZ reported. A photograph reviewed by the outlet appeared to show the rising artist interacting with a man carrying a bag in Lake Elsinore, California — less than a third of a mile from Rivas’s family home. According to TMZ, the spot was only a six-minute walk from where she had last been living with her relatives in April 2024.Another image circulating online appears to show D4vd with a girl resembling Rivas, though authorities have not confirmed the identification. TMZ said that side-by-side comparisons suggested a striking similarity.The report comes days after officials identified Rivas as the body found inside a Tesla registered to the 20-year-old singer. The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner confirmed her identity on Wednesday, noting that the cause of death remains “deferred” pending further examination. The teenager’s remains were discovered on 8 September in an advanced state of decomposition at a Hollywood tow yard, after staff reported a foul odour coming from the impounded vehicle.TMZ reported it first received a tip that Rivas was the victim and contacted her mother, who told the outlet she was suspicious because police had said the girl had a “Shhh...”tattoo on her right index finger — a mark her daughter also had. The mother added that Rivas had a boyfriend named David. TMZ pointed out that D4vd himself has the same tattoo on his finger.The Tesla, a 2023 model with Texas plates, had been abandoned on a Los Angeles street and later towed. Workers at the lot found the body stuffed inside a bag in the front trunk. ABC7 reported that the vehicle had been there for around five days before the discovery.Authorities have not disclosed how Rivas’s body ended up in the car or whether the singer is being treated as a suspect. D4vd, who rose to fame in 2022 with the viral hit Romantic Homicide, has cancelled at least one concert, including a scheduled performance in Seattle last week. Neither he nor his representatives have issued any public comment as the investigation continues.","David Anthony Burke, known as D4vd, was seen in the area where 15-year-old Celeste Rivas lived before her disappearance.

Kirk Killing: Candace Owens Accuses FBI Of Faking Evidence; Says Tyler Robinson’s Texts are Fabricated

Tyler Robinson entered no plea: Here's what will happen next



Will federal charges be brought against Robinson?







Charlie Kirk's accused murderer, Tyler Robinson, made his first appearance in court yesterday wearing an anti-suicide vest showing extra precauting the administration is taking as Robinson already expressed his wish to end his life rather than face justice -- to his father.An anti-suicide vest is a safety device that has no buttons, zippers, cords, collars, or pockets or loops that could be used to tie or attach a ligature. It can't be torn as the material is a tear-resistant fabric. The person can not remove an anti-suicide vest by themselves. They need the staff's help to remove or cut the garment if removal becomes necessary.Tyler Robinson did not enter a plea during Tuesday's hearing after he was charged with seven counts, including that of aggravated murder. This means the accused killer of Charlie Kirk will remain in custody without bail for a long time. But the court granted a pre-trial protective order for Erika Kirk, meaning Robinson will be barred from contacting her. The prosecutors established the motive behind Tyler's assassination of Kirk as hatred, citing Tyler's conversation with his parents and boyfriend Lance Twiggs.There is a hearing at the end of September, and by that time, the court will appoint an attorney.A preliminary hearing serves the purpose of assuring the court that the prosecution has enough evidence to proceed to trial. Sometimes, a defendant can waive a preliminary hearing but it's not clear whether Robinson will apply for that.If prosecutors are able to get an indictment from a grand jury on the state charges, they will no longer need to have a preliminary hearing and would skip that step. They haven’t indicated if they are pursuing this option, but grand jury proceedings are secret and not able to be made public before an indictment is filed, CNN reported.The seven charges that have been slapped against Robinson are state charges and there is no clarity yet on whether the Justice Department will bring federal charges. The department is still considering the matter","Tyler Robinson did not enter a plea during Tuesday's hearing after he was charged with seven counts, including that of aggravated murder.

Poll Would you support a complete ban on TikTok ? Yes, prioritize security. No, it should stay regardless.

Win-Win solution sets stage for broader US-China relations





US President Donald Trump announced that his administration has reached a deal with China to keep TikTok operating in the United States, following negotiations between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Madrid. The framework agreement would transfer TikTok's American operations from Chinese parent company ByteDance to a US-based consortium including Oracle, Andreessen Horowitz, and Silver Lake Management.Under the tentative deal, ByteDance's stake in TikTok would be reduced to below 20 percent to comply with a 2024 national security law requiring divestiture or facing a US ban. Trump extended the enforcement deadline until December 16, marking the fourth postponement since taking office. The deal requires final approval from both Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during a scheduled call Friday.The fate of TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm remains uncertain despite the framework agreement. At a Madrid press conference, Chinese cyber security official Wang Jingtao indicated that ByteDance would ""license the algorithm and other intellectual property rights"" to the US operation, suggesting continued Chinese involvement in the technology that drives the app's success.This arrangement conflicts with US requirements that ByteDance have no operational control after divestiture.The House Select Committee on China warned that any deal retaining Chinese algorithm control would violate the divestiture law. American officials have long expressed concerns that China could manipulate the algorithm to influence content consumption among TikTok's 170 million US users.China called the framework agreement a ""win-win"" solution in a Wednesday People's Daily commentary, stating it would review TikTok's technology exports and intellectual property licensing according to Chinese law. The breakthrough could facilitate broader US-China economic discussions as both nations navigate their current tariff truce.Oracle shares rose nearly 6 percent Tuesday before retreating, reflecting investor optimism about the cloud services provider's continued partnership with TikTok through Project Texas. The deal structure mirrors earlier negotiations shelved when Trump announced steep Chinese tariffs.Trump credited TikTok with boosting his support among younger voters during his 2024 election campaign, calling the app valuable and expressing reluctance to see its worth ""thrown out the window"" through an outright ban.","US President Donald Trump announced that his administration has reached a deal with China to keep TikTok operating in the United States.

WARSAW: Polish missile or Russian drone? Poland was investigating Wednesday what kind of projectile damaged a house last week during an intrusion into its airspace by around 20 drones.Initial suspicion was that debris from a Russian drone, shot down by Polish air defence, had hit the building.No one on the ground was hurt, but the incident provided some of the most dramatic images of the episode, which escalated tensions between Moscow and the NATO allies -- already sky-high over Russia's invasion of neighbouring Ukraine.Polish media reports now suggest that the house in the village of Wyryki in the east of the country was hit by an AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missile fired by a Polish F-16 fighter that was scrambled to hunt the drones.""The investigation is in its preliminary stage, and we must wait for expert opinion to determine what type of weaponry damaged this house,"" Anna Adamiak, spokeswoman for the national prosecutor's office, told AFP.Poland's prime minister Donald Tusk has insisted that regardless of what kind of object hit the rural home, responsibility for the incident lies squarely with Moscow.""All responsibility for the damage caused to the house in Wyryki falls on the perpetrators of the drone provocation, namely Russia,"" Tusk declared in a social media post.""All circumstances of the incident will be communicated to the public, the government, and the president by the relevant services once the investigation is concluded,"" he added.Russia, which launches drone attacks daily against Poland's neighbour Ukraine, has denied targeting Poland.According to Adamiak, the investigation into ""the violation of Polish airspace"" and ""endangerment"" of people and property concerns all drone intrusions recorded during the night of September 9 to 10.Poland, a Nato member, and some of its allies deployed aircraft and other military resources to counter the intruding drones, most or all of which were ultimately either shot down or recovered, mainly in the east and centre of the country.","Initial suspicion was that debris from a Russian drone, shot down by Polish air defence, had hit the building.

'Censored' science





WASHINGTON: The ex-chief of the US disease prevention agency told senators Wednesday she was fired for refusing to approve changes to childhood vaccine schedules not backed by scientific evidence, as the Trump administration moves to dismantle longstanding health policy.The high-profile testimony follows last month's abrupt ouster of the centers for disease control and prevention head Susan Monarez, who told lawmakers on the Senate Health Committee that US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr also demanded she fire career scientists from the agency without cause.""Even under pressure I could not replace evidence with ideology, or compromise my integrity,"" she told the panel.""Vaccine policy must be guided by credible data, not predetermined outcomes.""The testimony comes a day before a highly anticipated meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices -- a body Kennedy has dramatically revamped, firing all of its members and replacing them with figures whose views mirror his own vaccine skepticism.Monarez said Kennedy had demanded she agree to rubber-stamp every recommendation that committee makes to the CDC.She was fired less than a month after senators had voted to confirm her with unanimous support from Republican lawmakers.Her testimony contradicts what Kennedy had told the Senate Finance Committee. He insisted he had only requested she keep an open mind and said that she ultimately had not been ""trustworthy.""Under questioning from Republican Senate health committee chair Bill Cassidy, a physician who continues to vouch for the safety of vaccines, Monarez said she told Kennedy she ""would be open"" to childhood vaccine schedule shifts if there were solid scientific data to justify them.But Kennedy ""did not have any data or science to point to,"" she said.""To be clear, he said there was not science or data"" but he ""still expected you to change this?"" Cassidy asked.""Correct,"" Monarez responded.Monarez's ouster was followed by the departure of several senior CDC officials from the body.Former CDC chief medical officer Debra Houry also testified Wednesday, and said Kennedy ""censored CDC science, politicized its processes and stripped leaders of independence.""""I could not in good conscience remain under those conditions.""Senator Angela Alsobrooks, a Democrat, later asked Houry if she believed Kennedy was ""incompetent and dangerous to the American people's health.""Houry was uncompromising in her response: ""Seeing what he has asked our scientists to do and to compromise our integrity, and the children that have died under his watch, I think he should resign.""In 2025, the United States experienced its worst measles outbreak in more than 30 years, with more than 1,400 total confirmed cases and three deaths, including two young children.Asked by Republican Susan Collins what the public health implications might be if major CDC decisions come from politicized ideology rather than hard science, Monarez said it could move the US into ""a very dangerous place in public health.""""These are very important, highly technical discussions that have life-saving implications for our children and others who need vaccines.""Vaccines are safe and effective, according to the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community, but critics say the Trump administration has gone out of its way to sow doubt about them.",Susan Monarez says she was fired for refusing to approve changes to childhood vaccine schedules.

Alexei Navalny's widow says lab reports show her husband was poisoned,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/alexei-navalnys-widow-says-lab-reports-show-her-husband-was-poisoned/articleshow/123962643.cms,"Alexei Navalny's widow says lab reports show her husband was poisoned (AP)





The widow of Alexei Navalny said Wednesday that two independent labs have found that her husband was poisoned shortly before his death in a Russian prison.Navalny, who crusaded against official corruption and staged massive anti-Kremlin protests as President Vladimir Putin 's fiercest foe, died in the Arctic penal colony in February 2024. He was serving a 19-year sentence that he believed to be politically motivated.Authorities said that the politician became ill after a walk but have otherwise given few details on his death. He was 47.In a video released Wednesday, Yulia Navalnaya said that biological samples from Navalny's body had been taken out of Russia and tested at two laboratories abroad.She said that both laboratories concluded that Navalny had been poisoned, but had not released their findings due to ""political considerations.""""These labs in two different countries reached the same conclusion: Alexei was killed. More specifically, he was poisoned,"" Navalnaya said in the video, which was posted on social media.In the clip, she questioned the lack of video footage from the prison and showed images purported to be of Navalny's cell on the day of his death showing vomit on the floor. She did not provide direct proof that Navalny had been poisoned or that it had been carried out by prison authorities.""I demand that the laboratories that conducted the research publish their results,"" she said. ""Stop appeasing Putin for some higher 'considerations.' You cannot placate him. While you stay silent, he does not stop,"" Navalnaya said.Navalnaya has repeatedly blamed Putin for Navalny's death, something Russian officials have vehemently denied.In a press conference Wednesday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he was not aware of Navalnaya's statement and said that he could not comment.Navalnaya said in August 2024 that she was told by Russian investigators that Navalny died from a combination of ""a dozen different diseases"" and that he finally succumbed to arrhythmia, or an irregular heartbeat.Navalnaya disputed Russian officials' version of events and said her husband exhibited no instances of heart disease while alive.Navalny previously suffered from another poisoning in 2020, when the opposition leader fell sick on an internal flight in Russia. He was flown to Berlin while still in a coma for treatment two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons, established that he was exposed to the Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent.Russian authorities have denied any involvement in the incident, a claim that Navalny challenged as false.","Alexei Navalny died in a Russian prison in February 2024.

'Trump admin crackdown': Immigration court orders Mahmoud Khalil deportation to Syria or Algeria,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-admin-crackdown-immigration-court-orders-mahmoud-khalil-deportation-to-syria-or-algeria-heres-why/articleshow/123962003.cms,"Mahmoud Khalil (Image/X)





An immigration judge in Louisiana has ordered pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the US, to be deported to Syria or Algeria for allegedly failing to disclose certain information on his green card application, according to court documents filed Wednesday by his lawyers.Khalil’s attorneys indicated they plan to appeal the deportation order but expressed concern that the process would likely be swift and unfavorable.The ruling by Immigration Judge Jamee Comans comes despite a separate federal court order in New Jersey that blocks Khalil’s deportation while the court considers his claim that his detention and deportation are unlawful retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians, as reported by Politico.Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student who helped organize pro-Palestinian campus protests, was arrested on March 8 at his Manhattan residence and detained in Louisiana.He has not been charged with any crime. His arrest was part of the President Donald Trump administration’s wider effort to target foreign-born pro-Palestinian academics legally studying or working in the US.In a letter to New Jersey Federal Judge Michael Farbiarz, Khalil’s lawyers said they have 30 days from September 12, the date of the Louisiana judge’s ruling, to appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).They noted that the BIA process is typically fast and that appeals to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals are rarely successful, particularly for stays of removal for noncitizens.“As a result,” the lawyers wrote, “the only meaningful impediment to Petitioner’s physical removal from the United States would be this Court’s important order prohibiting removal during the pendency of his federal habeas case.” They further added that nothing else would preserve his lawful permanent resident status.In a statement, Khalil, originally from Syria, criticized the Trump administration of using 'fascist tactics'.“It is no surprise that the Trump administration continues to retaliate against me for my exercise of free speech. Their latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again,” he said.Earlier this year, Khalil spent more than three months in detention after the Trump administration invoked a rarely used provision of immigration law that allows deportation of noncitizens, even legal permanent residents if the Secretary of State determines their presence harms US foreign policy interests.In June, Judge Farbiarz, a former President Joe Biden appointee, blocked Khalil’s deportation on foreign policy grounds and ordered his release, determining he was neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community. Khalil then returned to New York, reuniting with his wife, a US citizen and their newborn son, who was born during his detention.The Trump administration has since pursued Khalil’s deportation on another basis, alleging that he failed to fully disclose his past employment and memberships in certain organizations on his green card application.","Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student, was arrested on March 8 at his Manhattan residence and detained in Louisiana.

Charlie Kirk assassination: Leftist ideology the motive?

‘Charlie Kirk’s Shooter Was Radicalised Online’: Trump Slams Social Media For Protecting Extremists

Here are 10 key facts about Charlie Kirk assassination case:

Robinson allegedly confessed and left a chilling note



Was the attack premeditated?

Discord at the centre of investigation



A ‘leftist ideology’ and online radicalisation



What we know about his partner

Details from Tyler Robinson's childhood

Electronic devices and ammunition offer further clues



Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty



The Fallout: National mourning and political repercussions



Security questions and a nation on edge







Six days after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at Utah Valley University, investigators are piecing together a clearer picture of the man accused of carrying out the assassination. Tyler Robinson, 22, was arrested soon after the rooftop attack and now faces the prospect of a capital murder charge.As the FBI and local authorities continue to piece together Robinson’s motive and movements, new revelations paint a chilling portrait of a quiet, intelligent young man whose ideology reportedly turned extreme.FBI Director Kash Patel revealed that Tyler Robinson allegedly sent a text message before the shooting, stating: “I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I was going to do that.” When asked why, he reportedly said: “Some hatred cannot be negotiated with.” According to Patel, Robinson also made online admissions and “essentially admitted” to the shooting through witness interviews. Investigators recovered remnants of a destroyed note in which he claimed he was going to carry out the attack.Robinson allegedly shot Kirk from a rooftop hundreds of yards away from Utah Valley University’s campus, where Kirk was addressing a large crowd. Law enforcement found a rifle wrapped in a towel and a screwdriver near the scene. DNA evidence on both items matched Robinson, according to FBI Director Patel. Investigators also recovered engraved bullets containing taunting messages, including one that read: “Hey, fascist! Catch!”Discord, a messaging platform popular with gamers, has become a focal point of the investigation.Authorities say Robinson communicated with others via Discord about retrieving a weapon from a “drop point” and had conversations involving bullet engraving. However, Discord officials told Fox News Digital that these messages did not take place on their platform and that they found no evidence Robinson used Discord to plan the attack. Nonetheless, the FBI is examining Robinson’s entire digital footprint, including chat logs, phone messages, and social media activity.Utah Governor Spencer Cox said Robinson's family and friends described him as politically shifting “to the left” in recent years and spending increasing time in the “dark corners of the internet.” Authorities believe his ideology played a role, although a clear motive remains unconfirmed. “There clearly was a leftist ideology,” said Cox on NBC’s Meet the Press, noting that Kirk’s controversial stances, particularly on transgender issues, may have made him a target.Robinson's romantic partner is transgender, a detail some political figures have pointed to as a possible reason behind the assassination, given Kirk’s vocal stance against transgender rights. However, authorities have not confirmed any direct connection between Robinson’s personal relationship and the motive for the killing. Utah’s public safety commissioner said the partner has been “incredibly cooperative” and had no knowledge of the plan.Robinson grew up in St. George, Utah, in what appears to be a stable and outdoors-oriented family. He was a high school honours student, scoring in the 99th percentile nationally on standardised tests. He was accepted into Utah State University on an academic scholarship but only completed one semester. At the time of the shooting, he was a third-year student in an electrical apprenticeship programme at Dixie Technical College. His family has not commented publicly.FBI agents seized multiple electronic devices from Robinson’s home, including laptops, gaming systems, and mobile phones. According to Director Patel, investigators are conducting a “reverse daisy chain analysis” of everyone Robinson contacted. Ammunition found at the scene featured anti-fascist engravings and meme-culture references. Prosecutors have not ruled out additional federal charges, depending on what further evidence is uncovered.Utah prosecutors are expected to indict Robinson for first-degree murder and other felonies, including obstruction of justice and unlawful discharge of a firearm. State Attorney General Pam Bondi has stated her office will pursue the death penalty, describing it as “very real in Utah,” where firing squads remain a legal form of execution. Federal prosecutors are also weighing potential charges.Kirk’s assassination has triggered a wave of grief across the country. Vigils were held in Washington D.C., Arizona, and Utah. At Utah Valley University, students created a makeshift memorial of flowers and flags. Vice President JD Vance, a personal friend of Kirk, hosted an emotional tribute on The Charlie Kirk Show. Meanwhile, public workers, teachers, and even media commentators have faced consequences for mocking or criticising Kirk’s death, sparking a national conversation about free speech and political civility.The attack has raised serious questions about the adequacy of security at political events, especially on college campuses. Kirk often insisted on being close to students and the public, with varying levels of protection. As more details emerge, officials and security experts are reviewing protocols. FBI Director Patel stressed that authorities are still investigating whether Robinson acted entirely alone or had support. Utah officials said they are examining every possible contact Robinson had in the lead-up to the assassination.","Tyler Robinson, 22, allegedly shot conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University.

Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, has been left reeling after the body of a student, Demartravion “Trey” Reed, was found hanging from a tree on campus, Fox News reported. The 21-year-old, from Grenada, Mississippi, was discovered on Monday morning in the central part of campus near the pickleball courts, according to University Police Chief Michael Peeler. He confirmed that Reed’s death is under investigation but said there is no evidence of foul play and no ongoing threat to campus safety.In a statement, Delta State President Dr Dan Ennis said the community was “deeply saddened by this loss” and that he had spoken to Reed’s family to express the university’s “heartbreak.” He added that counselling services were being made available to students, faculty and staff. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, the Bolivar County Sheriff’s Office, Cleveland Police Department, and the Bolivar County Coroner are all involved in the inquiry, with an autopsy set to be conducted.Fox 13 Memphis reported that Reed’s body was discovered around 7am on September 15. Chief Peeler told reporters that while the circumstances were tragic, students should know the campus remains safe.“I just want to confirm, this is a safe campus. Delta State University is a beautiful place to be. It’s just unfortunate this loss that comes heavily to our campus,” he said.The discovery prompted the immediate closure of the campus, with all classes and events cancelled. The Independent reported that celebrations marking the university’s 100th anniversary, scheduled for Monday, were also called off. Officials said further updates would be shared “when appropriate” and urged compassion for Reed’s loved ones during what they described as a “difficult time.”The university has not confirmed when normal operations will resume. Authorities said the investigation remains active and urged the public to direct all questions to University Police.","Demartravion ""Trey"" Reed, 21, was found hanging from a tree on campus.

US Vice-President JD Vance has said that national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk , warning that such behaviour fuels further political violence.Speaking as guest host of The Charlie Kirk Show on Monday, Vance said: “Call them out, and hell, call their employer. We don't believe in political violence, but we do believe in civility.”The vice-president took over presenting duties from his ceremonial office at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, with the programme livestreamed into the White House press briefing room. It was the first episode of the podcast since Kirk, 31, was fatally shot in the neck while moderating a debate at Utah Valley University last week.Vance, who flew Kirk’s body home to Arizona aboard Air Force Two, said he was “filling in for somebody who cannot be filled in for”. He recounted conversations with Kirk’s widow Erika, describing him as “a kind, loving husband”, and admitted her words had inspired him to “be a better husband and… a better father”.In his remarks, Vance directly challenged those making light of Kirk’s assassination. “There is no unity with the people who celebrate Charlie Kirk's assassination,” he said.“There is no unity with someone who lies about what Charlie Kirk said in order to excuse his murder… And there is no unity with the people who fund these articles, who pay the salaries of these terrorist sympathisers who argue that Charlie Kirk, a loving husband and father, deserved a shot to the neck because he spoke words with which they disagree. ”He added: “I’m desperate for our country to be united in condemnation of the actions and the ideas that killed my friend. I want it so badly that I will tell you a difficult truth. We can only have it with people who acknowledge that political violence is unacceptable.”Other Republicans have echoed calls for accountability. Florida congressman Randy Fine said he would “demand their firing, defunding, and licence revocation”, while South Carolina’s Nancy Mace urged federal funding to be cut from universities that refuse to act.Vance, who described Kirk as a close friend and mentor, credited him with helping President Donald Trump’s re-election and with shaping the administration. “If it weren't for Charlie Kirk, I would not be the vice president of the United States,” he said.","US Vice-President JD Vance said national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Assassination of Melissa Hortman



Upcoming special elections in Minnesota







Democrat Xp Lee won the Minnesota House special election on Tuesday, filling the seat left vacant by Rep Melissa Hortman, a top Democratic leader who was tragically assassinated in June.Lee, a former Brooklyn Park City Council member and health equity analyst, defeated Republican real estate agent Ruth Bittner in the heavily Democratic district.Lee previously won a three-way Democratic primary in August. Top Minnesota Democrats, including governor Tim Walz and senator Amy Klobuchar, campaigned in his favor. Bittner ran unopposed in the Republican primary.Lee’s victory restores the 67-67 tie in the Minnesota House, preserving the bipartisan power-sharing agreement established after the 2024 elections. The arrangement, brokered by Hortman, allowed Republican Lisa Demuth to become House Speaker while Hortman became speaker emerita.Most legislative committees remain evenly split, requiring bipartisan agreement to pass bills during the 2025 legislative session.The special election comes after the shocking assassination of Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark on June 14 in their Brooklyn Park home by a man impersonating a police officer.Another legislator and spouse were also shot but survived. Vance Boelter, 57, faces federal and state murder, attempted murder, and other charges.Lee said he wants to calm the “charged atmosphere” following recent acts of political violence, including the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah. Bittner added that the violence briefly gave her pause about running but stated, “there’s no way to solve this problem if we shrink back in fear.”Two more special elections are scheduled for November 4 in Minnesota senate districts. One is for the Democratic seat vacated by senator Nicole Mitchell of Woodbury, who resigned after a conviction, and the other is for the Republican seat vacated by senator Bruce Anderson of Buffalo, who died in July.Control of the senate is not expected to change due to the partisan nature of the districts. If the Democratic candidate for Mitchell’s seat wins, the governor will have to call another special election to fill the House seat.","Democrat Xp Lee won the Minnesota House special election on Tuesday, filling the seat left vacant by Rep Melissa Hortman.

Two brothers from North Carolina on Wednesday testified about a box left with them by a man accused of attempting to assassinate President Donald Trump at his Florida golf course last year.Samuel and Lazaro Plata said that Ryan Routh left the container at Lazaro Plata’s home in April 2024, roughly five months before the alleged attack. The box reportedly contained pipes, bullets, wires and other materials.The Plata brothers have known Routh for about 30 years and previously worked at his roofing business. They contacted authorities in September 2024 after news of Routh’s arrest became public, news agency Associated Press reported.Wednesday marked the fifth day of testimony in Routh’s trial. Prosecutors allege that Routh spent weeks planning the attack before aiming a rifle through shrubbery at Trump while he played golf on September 15, 2024 at his West Palm Beach country club.Routh has pleaded not guilty to charges including attempting to assassinate President, assaulting a federal officer and multiple firearm violations.US District Judge Aileen Cannon had scheduled over three weeks for the trial at the Fort Pierce federal courthouse. Prosecutors indicated they expect to rest their case by Thursday or Friday, with Routh’s witnesses subpoenaed to appear by Friday.Both brothers testified that they never opened the box until after Routh’s arrest.Lazaro Plata said he had no reason to suspect anything was wrong when Routh left the container.An FBI agent testified that a 12-page handwritten letter addressed to “Dear World” was found in the box.“This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I failed you,” the handwritten letter read. “I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster. It is up to you now to finish the job; and I will offer $150,000 to whomever can complete the job.”Routh requested that the full letter be admitted into evidence, arguing that the excerpted lines lacked context. He was particularly focused on a passage referencing the shredding of Trump’s plane and noted that the letter made no mention of a golf course, the site of the alleged attack.Also on Wednesday, Ronnie Jay Oxendine testified that he sold Routh the SKS rifle allegedly used in the assassination attempt. Oxendine, convicted of a weapons charge in July, was testifying as part of a plea agreement.A Secret Service agent previously testified that Routh aimed his rifle at the agent before Trump came into view. The agent fired, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing. Law enforcement later arrested Routh with the help of a witness who had seen a person fleeing the scene.The alleged attack comes just nine weeks after Trump survived another assassination attempt while campaigning in Pennsylvania. In that incident, a gunman fired eight shots, grazing Trump’s ear before being fatally shot by a Secret Service sniper.","Samuel and Lazaro Plata said that Ryan Routh left the container at their home in April 2024, roughly five months before the alleged attack. The box reportedly contained pipes, bullets, wires and other materials. Routh has pleaded not guilty to charges including attempting to assassinate President, assaulting a federal officer and multiple firearm violations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123961250,imgsize-675023,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Utah Attorney Exposes Stunning Details About Kirk's Killer; 'Delete Texts & Stay Silent'

.





US president Donald Trump on Wednesday celebrated ABC’s decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel 's show, mocking the late-night host of having “zero talent” and praising the network for “finally having the courage to do what had to be done.”In a Truth Social post, Trump wrote: “Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done. Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that’s possible. That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT.”The suspension came after mounting controversy over Kimmel’s remarks about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.“Jimmy Kimmel Live will be pre-empted indefinitely,” an ABC spokesperson said. The move followed Nexstar, a major operator of ABC affiliates, announcing that it would not carry the show “for the foreseeable future,” citing strong objections to Kimmel’s comments.The controversy stems from Kimmel’s Monday night monologue, in which he accused the MAGA movement of politicizing the case of Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old charged with aggravated murder in the shooting death of Charlie Kirk.Kirk, a 31-year-old conservative commentator and activist, was shot dead in Utah last week. Robinson appeared in court on Tuesday to face charges.“The MAGA Gang (is) desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said. “In between the finger-pointing, there was grieving.”The remarks drew sharp criticism from Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair Brendan Carr, who described Kimmel’s conduct as “the sickest possible” in an interview with podcaster Benny Johnson.Carr warned that the FCC could consider revoking affiliate licenses if broadcasters failed to take corrective action.“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said. “These companies can find ways to change conduct and take actions on Kimmel, or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”The Center for American Rights also filed a complaint with the FCC, insisting that satire was no excuse for violating public-interest broadcasting standards.Daniel Suhr, president of the organization in his complaint wrote, ""ABC’s affiliates need to step up and hold ABC accountable as a network for passing through material that fails to respect the public-interest standard to which they are held.""“Disney as ABC’s corporate owner needs to act directly to correct this problem,” said the group’s president,"" he added.Not everyone at the FCC agreed. Commissioner Anna Gomez, the body’s lone Democrat, criticized the administration’s handling of the issue.In a post on X, Gomez said, “The Trump administration is increasingly using the weight of government power to suppress lawful expression.”She warned that “to surrender our right to speak freely is to accept that those in power, not the people, will set the boundaries of debate that define a free society.”The suspension comes just weeks after CBS announced it would cancel The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in 2026, marking its exit from late-night television.CBS cited financial pressures and its upcoming merger with Skydance Media, though the move followed a legal settlement with President and growing tension over Colbert’s sharp criticism of his administration.Kimmel has long been a target of Trump’s criticism, particularly for his monologues skewering the president and his supporters.After his suspension was confirmed, the White House rapid response account called the comedian “a sick freak” and said ABC was “doing their viewers a favor.”","President Donald Trump celebrated ABC's decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel's show.

"'Sick, dangerous': Trump labels Antifa 'terrorist organisation'; calls for funding probe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-labels-antifa-as-terrorist-organisation-links-murder-of-kirk-to-radical-left-funding-to-face-investigation/articleshow/123959981.cms,"Utah Attorney Exposes Stunning Details About Kirk's Killer; 'Delete Texts & Stay Silent'





US President Donald Trump on Thursday announced that he is designating Antifa as a terrorist organisation, citing what he described as its role in political violence following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.Posting on Truth Social, the President wrote: “I am pleased to inform our many U.S.A. Patriots that I am designating ANTIFA, A SICK, DANGEROUS, RADICAL LEFT DISASTER, AS A MAJOR TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. I will also be strongly recommending that those funding ANTIFA be thoroughly investigated in accordance with the highest legal standards and practices. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”The move comes as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson was charged with Kirk’s murder in Utah. Robinson’s links to Antifa are already fuelling speculation online. Investigators have noted that bullet casings recovered from the scene carried anti-fascist slogans, including the words “Hey fascist! Catch!” and references to Bella Ciao, an Italian resistance song.According to the FBI, Robinson also admitted in a Discord group that he killed Kirk and had previously written a note declaring his intention to do so.Agents have not ruled out whether others were aware of his plans.CNN reported that Trump had previously floated the idea of labelling Antifa as domestic terrorists, saying in the Oval Office that “It’s something I would do, yeah” if he found support from Cabinet officials and the Justice Department. Although Antifa is a loosely organised movement without central leadership or membership, Trump insisted he was prepared to take action.The President has also raised the prospect of using racketeering laws to pursue left-wing groups, telling Attorney General Pam Bondi to examine whether RICO charges could be applied. “They should be put in jail, what they’re doing to this country is really subversive,” he said, according to CNN.Deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller backed the President’s remarks, claiming a “network of organisations” were funding violence, including Black Lives Matter demonstrations. “The key point the president has been making is somebody is paying for all of this … they will now be criminally liable for paying for violence,” Miller said.Democrats have pushed back, accusing Trump of using the Kirk case as a pretext to clamp down on dissent. But Trump has remained defiant, arguing that the “radical left causes tremendous violence” while dismissing concerns about right-wing threats.","US President Donald Trump designates Antifa as a terrorist organisation.

More Than 150,000 Evacuated in Pakistan Punjab After India’s Flood Alert

Relief in Jalalpur Pirwala, Alipur

Waters recede, but threat not over

Fields and cattle lost





Even as floodwaters began to recede in parts of south Punjab, the scale of destruction remains staggering, nearly 2.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes and at least 101 lives have been lost, the Dawn reported.The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has called the ongoing evacuation and relief drive one of the largest in recent memory. More than 1,500 boats were deployed to rescue stranded families, with 12,427 people evacuated from villages along the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers.Multan, Muzaffargarh and Rahim Yar Khan districts bore the brunt of the floods. Entire villages were submerged — including the union council of Lati Mari in Alipur tehsil, home to 40,000 people.“Nearly 15,000 people from our basti had to leave on their own as water rose,” said Syed Kausar Shah, a local resident. “Homes and crops were destroyed, and people escaped on a hired boat. Some now live in relief camps, others under the open sky.” He added that two villagers drowned while attempting to flee.Officials declared Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur tehsils safe after a major flood wave passed through Head Panjnad.Multan Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu confirmed that 100,000 people had been evacuated from Jalalpur Pirwala alone in three days.Breaches in Shujabad and Jalalpur Pirwala are now being filled, while helicopters and drones drop food and medicine into cut-off areas. Boats continue to ferry supplies into rural belts.At a press briefing in Bahawalpur, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said Panjnad Headworks still faced a “high flood” but levels had dropped from 700,000 cusecs earlier this week to 575,000 cusecs on Saturday. By evening, the Flood Forecasting Division reported further decline to 492,695 cusecs.“There is no threat to Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur cities,” Kathia assured, adding that water in Bahawalpur would also recede within 24 hours. He called the scale of evacuation “historic,” stressing that Multan could have faced forced evacuations if operations were delayed.According to official data, 4,447 mouzas across 28 districts have been inundated. Alongside the mass displacement of people, more than 2.19 million cattle were rescued and shifted to higher ground.For now, the rivers appear to be calming, the Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala was recorded at 95,000 cusecs, categorised as medium flood. But for the millions already uprooted, the crisis has only just begun.","Nearly 2.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes and at least 101 lives have been lost.
