NEW DELHI: Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh on Saturday expressed deep concern over the disappearance of 56-year-old Meitei man Laishram Kamalbabu from the Leimakhong Army camp, calling the incident “very unfortunate.” He criticised the event occurring within the Army campus and assured that both the central and state governments are prioritising efforts to locate Kamalbabu.""The Central government has asked the concerned authority to find out the person's whereabouts and the state govt has also sent the team in search of the missing person. Our common agenda is to find the missing person and it is very unfortunate that such an incident happened inside the Army campus,"" he said.Kamalbabu, who had been supervising work for a contractor with the Military Engineering Services (MES) at the Leimakhong military station, went missing on November 25. He had left his home in Imphal West at 9 am for work, but failed to return later that afternoon. His family reported his disappearance after attempts to contact him failed. Kamalbabu’s younger brother filed a missing person's report, stating that Kamalbabu had been seen inside the Army campus, accompanied by a Nepali individual, before his phone was switched off.The Indian Army had launched an extensive search operation, which includes ground combing, drone surveillance, and aerial platforms in the military station and surrounding villages. The defence public relations office confirmed that the search was ramped up after they received the missing person report, which came on the evening of November 25. Despite these efforts, Kamalbabu’s whereabouts remain unknown.A joint action committee, formed by local residents, staged a sit-in protest in Imphal West on Wednesday, demanding that the Army ensure Kamalbabu’s safe return. The protesters insisted that the Indian Army be held accountable for the incident, calling for immediate action to locate the missing man.Chief minister Biren Singh said that the Army holds responsibility for tracing Kamalbabu, especially considering the gravity of the situation. He acknowledged the ongoing unrest caused by the incident, coming on the heels of another tragedy in Jiribam, where three women and three children were killed. Singh confirmed that the state government, alongside the Army, has been in touch with central officials to expedite the search.","Laishram Kamalbabu, 56, went missing from the Leimakhong Army camp on November 25.

Reinstatement post bail: SC to study impact on witnesses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/reinstatement-post-bail-sc-to-study-impact-on-witnesses/articleshow/115910938.cms,"(File photo)

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday decided to examine a plea seeking recall of its Sept 26 bail order to DMK 's Senthil Balaji on the ground that witnesses may not feel free to depose against a cabinet minister. Balaji was granted bail in a money laundering case linked to a cash-for-jobs scam.In what can have implications for similarly placed politicians, SC, which has recently modulated rigorous bail provisions of special laws like PMLA and UAPA by ruling that the principle 'bail is the rule and jail is the exception' is also applicable in these offences, indicated that it would send a wrong signal if a high-profile accused was re-inducted in public office immediately after bail. It said justice should not only be done but should also be seen to be done.A bench of Justices A S Oka and A G Masih said it would not re-examine its verdict but would examine the limited aspect of apprehension that witnesses may feel in the case.In contrast to the convention of politicians quitting official positions after being arrested and chargesheeted - something that was followed across the political spectrum for decades - some high-profile politicians have held on to their positions despite having been incarcerated. The SC, which did not object to the departure from convention so far, now seems to be firming up a position against it.The court's remarks in Balaji's case follow its earlier order where it gave the chief of TMC youth wing bail on the condition that he would not hold any official position. Balaji, on the other hand, was re-inducted as minister three days after being released on bail following a 15-month stint in custody.""The present application is based on apprehension... The apprehension is that considering the seriousness of the allegations against the second respondent in the predicate offences, witnesses may not be in the frame of mind to depose against the second respondent who is now holding the position of a cabinet minister. This is the only aspect on which, prima facie, we are inclined to consider the application,"" the bench said in its order.Sensing the mood and prima facie opinion of the bench, senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, appearing for Balaji, urged the court to refrain from issuing notice in the case and assured that he would take instruction and brief the court on the next date of hearing.",Senthil Balaji was granted bail in a money laundering case linked to a cash-for- jobs scam.

The New Yorker reports, citing the complaint, “At one point, Hegseth had to be restrained while drunk from joining the dancers on the stage of a Louisiana strip club, where he had brought his team.” The complaint, compiled by former CVA employees, also alleges Hegseth and his management team pursued female staffers, calling them as “party girls” and “not party girls.”The New Yorker further reports Hegseth stepped down from CVA in 2016 partly due to “concerns about his mismanagement and abuse of alcohol on the job.” The article also details financial troubles at Vets for Freedom (VFF), another group Hegseth led. It claims VFF incurred “enormous debt” under his leadership and donors ultimately reduced his role and compensation before he left in 2012.Hegseth’s attorney, Timothy Parlatore, responded to the allegations with a statement: “We’re not going to comment on outlandish claims laundered through The New Yorker by a petty and jealous disgruntled former associate of Mr. Hegseth’s.

Why Joe Biden pardoned his son

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre came under fire Monday after President Joe Biden announced pardon to his son Hunter Biden -- a move any hint of which was consistently shot down by the White House. And the press secretary, whenever asked whether Bidne would pardon his son, said no. On Monday, Jean-Pierre was asked aboard Air Force One why she persistently lied about the issue to which the press secretary reacted by saying: ""The president took an action because of how politically infected these cases were.""“The system doesn’t get corrupted by politics for people whose name is not Biden?” a reporter asked. “You’re twisting and misrepresenting what I’m saying. I’m talking about a particular issue right now,” Jean-Pierre said.“Does the president believe now and agree with President-elect Trump that the justice system has been weaponized for political purposes and that it needs root and branch reform?” another asked.“No. Read the president’s statement. Seriously, read the president’s statement. He said he believes in the Department of Justice. He does. He says it in his statement. He also believes that war politics infected the process and it led to a miscarriage of justice,” she said.In his statement, Joe Biden said he wrestled with the decision which was made over the weekend. ""I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice — and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further. I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision,"" Biden said.""No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son — and that is wrong,"" Biden said in his statement. ""There has been an effort to break Hunter — who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they’ve tried to break me — and there’s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.""Hunter Biden was scheduled to be sentenced on December 12 for his conviction on federal gun charges. On December 16, he was to be sentenced for a separate criminal case of tax evasion.","Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, repeatedly said Joe Biden would not pardon his son Hunter Biden.

‘Totally possible’: Joe Rogan reacts to Jamie Foxx and Diddy poisoning rumours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/totally-possible-joe-rogan-reacts-to-jamie-foxx-and-diddy-poisoning-rumours/articleshow/115907791.cms,"Joe Rogan reacts to Jamie Foxx and Diddy poisoning rumours

Rogan’s take on the allegations

Eyewitnesses share mixed accounts

Diddy responds to allegations

Joe Rogan has joined the conversation about the viral rumours linking Sean ""Diddy"" Combs to Jamie Foxx's mysterious 2023 hospitalisation.The allegations, which gained traction after Foxx reportedly joked about the Bad Boy mogul ""poisoning"" him during a taping of his Netflix special ‘What Had Happened Was’, have sparked widespread speculation.On a recent episode of The Joe Rogan Experience, Rogan and his guests—comedians Shane Gillis, Mark Normand, and Ari Shaffir, discussed the controversial claims.Citing a report by Daily Mail, Rogan remarked, “Jamie Foxx just recently said that P Diddy poisoned him, and that’s why he got that stroke.” Rogan acknowledged the wild nature of the rumour but noted that Foxx’s comments could have been comedic in nature.“It’s possible, that’s totally possible, but it’s also possible he was explaining why he went to the hospital, and he hasn’t talked about it since,” Rogan stated. He further urged caution, emphasising that the truth might only be revealed once Foxx’s special airs.The rumours initially surfaced after attendees at the Netflix special taping alleged that Foxx linked Diddy to his health scare. One such eyewitness, Big Homie CC, claimed, “I know Combs poisoned Jamie Foxx, and Jamie Foxx reported him to the FBI because of it.”Another eyewitness, videographer Choke No Joke, shared during an interview with Comedy Hype that he did not perceive Foxx’s comments as a joke.“You’ll know if he was joking when you see the show,” Choke No Joke explained, adding that as a comedian himself, he believed Foxx’s tone suggested seriousness.A source close to Diddy vehemently denied the accusations. According to TMZ, the source stated, “There is no truth to Sean Combs putting Jamie Foxx in the hospital.”Meanwhile, Foxx himself has remained coy about the matter. When approached by reporters last month, the actor deflected questions with a simple, “God bless you,” and assured fans he was feeling better.The rumour comes at a tumultuous time for Diddy, who is currently facing multiple criminal and civil charges, including allegations of sex trafficking and racketeering.As per USA Today, Diddy’s third bail request was denied, with a judge citing concerns over public safety. These allegations have added fuel to conspiracy theories surrounding the rapper's alleged involvement in Foxx’s illness.With Jamie Foxx still recovering from his health scare and his Netflix special yet to premiere, the truth behind these sensational allegations remains elusive. Whether Foxx’s comments were part of his comedic routine or a serious revelation will only become clear when the show airs.","The rumours initially surfaced after attendees at the Netflix special taping alleged that Foxx linked Diddy to his health scare.

US President-elect Donald Trump offered a shocking role to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after the tariff threat.Recently, Trump and Trudeau met at Mar-a-Lago, the President-elect's Florida resort, where he reportedly suggested to the Canadian PM that if a tariff for failing to address trade and immigration issues would kill the neighbor to the north’s economy, maybe it should become the 51st state, according to Fox News sources.Trudeau made an unscheduled visit after Trump threatened substantial tariffs on Canadian products. The proposed 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico were linked to their alleged failure to control illegal immigration and drug trafficking into the United States.Fresh details have surfaced about their encounter, which Trump described as ""very productive.""The discussion of tariffs, border security and trade deficits dominated the agenda before the formal dinner service began.According to attendees, Trump maintained a welcoming yet direct approach whilst communicating his expectations to his Canadian counterpart.According to Fox News' sources, the president-elect told the prime minister if Canada cannot fix the border issues and trade deficit, he will levy a 25% tariff on all Canadian goods on day one when he returns to office.Trudeau told Trump he cannot levy the tariff because it would kill the Canadian economy completely. Trump replied – asking, so your country can't survive unless it's ripping off the US to the tune of $100 billion?Trump then suggested to Trudeau that Canada become the 51st state, which caused the prime minister and others to laugh nervously, sources told Fox News.He told Trudeau that if he cannot handle his list of demands without ripping the U.S. off in trade, maybe Canada should really become a state or two and Trudeau could become a governor.Despite the humorous exchanges, Trump emphasised his expectation for significant changes by January 20. The three-hour discussion covered various topics, with Canadian guests describing it as ""very friendly and very positive,"" though avoiding mention of the statehood suggestion.Both Trump's and Trudeau's offices have not responded to requests for comment from Fox News Digital regarding these statements.","US President-elect Donald Trump offered a shocking role to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after the tariff threat.

Who is Michael Hopkins?

Michael Hopkins is a former communications director who worked for Congressman Joe Morelle, a Democrat representing New York’s 25th Congressional District.



Hopkins was responsible for managing the office’s communications strategy, including public relations and media interactions.



Morelle, a senior figure in the House, serves as the Ranking Member of the Committee on House Administration and holds significant influence in Capitol operations and workplace policies.



Before this incident, Hopkins was a trusted aide within Morelle’s team, holding a crucial position in ensuring the congressman’s messages resonated with constituents and stakeholders.



His role was particularly pivotal given Morelle’s responsibilities as a ranking member on a committee that oversees security, administration, and operations of the House of Representatives.



Hopkins’ arrest has led to swift consequences. By Monday afternoon, Morelle’s office announced that Hopkins was no longer employed, stating that the decision was made “effective immediately.”



The congressman’s office expressed its commitment to cooperating fully with the investigation and maintaining a safe and secure workplace, as highlighted by Newsweek.



The arrest comes amid heightened scrutiny of security at the Capitol, especially following a similar incident in December 2023 when another staffer was arrested for possessing ammunition and a handgun.



That episode exposed vulnerabilities in Capitol security protocols, which have since been tightened.

Michael Hopkins , a 38-year-old former communications director for Representative Joe Morelle (D-NY), was arrested on Monday morning by US Capitol Police for attempting to bring ammunition into the Cannon House Office Building.During a routine bag screening at 8.45 am (local time), officers found 11 rounds of ammunition and four magazines, one of which was a high-capacity magazine. Hopkins reportedly stated that he had forgotten the ammunition was in his bag.He now faces charges for unlawful possession of ammunition, including one count related to the high-capacity magazine, reported Newsweek.The incident has sparked renewed scrutiny of Capitol security protocols . It is the second time in three years that a congressional staffer has been arrested for possessing ammunition at the Capitol.The arrest has already led to immediate repercussions, with Representative Morelle’s office terminating Hopkins’ employment by Monday afternoon and issuing a statement reaffirming its commitment to workplace safety, according to Axios.","Michael Hopkins, a 38-year-old former communications director for Representative Joe Morelle (D-NY), was arrested on Monday morning by US Capitol Police for attempting to bring ammunition into the Cannon House Office Building.

Community outrage and history of allegations

Call for accountability

Roger Golubski , a former Kansas police detective accused of kidnapping and sexually assaulting Black women over decades, was found dead at his Edwardsville home on Monday morning, reported the news agency AP.The 71-year-old’s death, ruled a suicide by authorities, occurred hours before jury selection for his highly anticipated trial was set to begin.According to CNN, Golubski was discovered after failing to appear in court. His attorney, Christopher Joseph, stated that his client had been “despondent” over recent media coverage but declined further comment.The Kansas Bureau of Investigation confirmed there were “no indications of foul play” in his death, CBS News reported.Golubski faced six felony counts of violating women’s civil rights and had denied the allegations.Prosecutors alleged that, during his tenure with the Kansas City, Kansas Police Department, Golubski used his authority to target vulnerable women, coercing sexual favours and threatening their families.According to CNN, Court filings indicated he deliberately chose victims he believed would not be believed.The accusations against Golubski, dating back to the 1980s, have long angered the community, deepening mistrust of law enforcement in Kansas City’s poorer neighbourhoods.Many female residents feared him, claiming he preyed on their vulnerabilities and wielded his power to intimidate those who resisted. AP reported that protesters gathered outside the courthouse on Monday morning, holding signs with slogans like “Justice Now!” despite sub-freezing temperatures.These criminal charges were part of a broader investigation into Golubski’s conduct during his 35 years as a police officer. One prominent case involved Lamonte McIntyre , a teenager wrongfully convicted of a double murder in 1994.McIntyre spent over 23 years in prison before his release in 2017. The case led to a $12.5 million settlement from local officials, though Golubski denied any wrongdoing, CNN reported.Prosecutors had acknowledged the difficulty of building the case against Golubski, as much of the evidence relied on the testimonies of his accusers. Seven other women were prepared to testify against him, CBS News reported.In one particularly harrowing account, prosecutors alleged that Golubski drove a woman to a cemetery, threatened her life, and subjected her to repeated assaults beginning in her teenage years.Golubski had been under house arrest and receiving dialysis treatments prior to his death, accordind to AP. His apparent suicide has left many victims feeling that justice has been denied.Cheryl Pilate, an attorney representing some of the women, has called for an independent investigation into his death, emphasising the community’s desire for a full public accounting of his alleged crimes.The Justice Department expressed its regret that the trial could not proceed, stating, “The proceedings in this case may be over, but its lasting impact on all the individuals and families involved remains.”",Roger Golubski was found dead at his Edwardsville home on Monday morning.

The Queens district attorney's office said Fakhri ""allegedly set the fire near the entrance of the building, trapping the two inside with no exit"". The victims died from smoke inhalation and thermal injuries.After the actress Nargis Fakhri’s sister Aliya was arrested and indicted in New York for the murder of her ex-boyfriend and his friend, their mother told the Daily News that her daughter was incapable of such a crime. “I don’t think she would be killing someone. She was a person caring for everybody. She tried to help everybody.” The mother also revealed, according to Daily News, that her daughter was struggling with an addiction to opioids.Queens DA Melinda Katz said that Aliya Fakhri (43) “maliciously ended the lives of two people…” According to prosecutors, Anastasia Ettienne realised there was a fire and went downstairs but then returned upstairs, where Edward Jacobs was sleeping, to try and save him but perished along with him.Fakhri was indicted by a grand jury on four counts of murder in the first, four counts of murder in the second, and one count each of arson in the first degree and arson in the second degree. She faces a potential maximum of life in prison if convicted of the top charge.

Get away from me’,” Janet was quoted as saying by New York Post. She added Aliya “wasn’t accepting the rejection”.

Jamie Lee Komoroski , a 26-year-old from South Carolina, admitted her guilt on Monday in a shocking case involving a fatal drunken driving crash that killed a bride and seriously injured the groom just hours after their wedding.She pleaded guilty to multiple charges, including felony DUI, reckless homicide, and DUI causing great bodily harm, according to WCSC.The guilty plea came at the start of Komoroski's trial, just as jury selection was about to begin. When questioned by Judge Deandra Jefferson, Komoroski confirmed her decision, stating, ""Yes, your honour,"" and waived her right to a jury trial.The tragic crash occurred on April 28, 2023, in Folly Beach, South Carolina, as newlyweds Samantha Miller , 34, and Aric Hutchinson , 36, were leaving their wedding reception in a golf-cart-style vehicle.Komoroski, reportedly driving at 65 mph in a 25 mph zone, rear-ended their vehicle. Miller died at the scene, while Hutchinson suffered multiple injuries, including broken bones and a brain injury. Two other passengers in the golf cart were also injured.Authorities revealed Komoroski's blood-alcohol content was 0.261, more than three times the legal limit, as per a toxicology report cited by CBS News.She initially claimed to police that ""something hit her"" and denied drinking, later admitting to consuming a tequila and pineapple drink and a beer. Officers noted she smelled strongly of alcohol and was driving in the opposite direction of her home. She refused field sobriety tests and was eventually compelled to provide blood samples via a warrant.Komoroski has been under house arrest since March. She faces up to 25 years in prison for her actions. The case has drawn widespread attention, with Miller's family and loved ones expressing their grief and anger in court.The tragedy has also led to a $1.3 million settlement in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Hutchinson, which named Komoroski, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, and several bars that served her alcohol on the day of the crash. Many establishments settled out of court.According to ABC11, Miller’s parents and sister shared emotional victim impact statements during the hearing, leaving Komoroski in tears. Hutchinson, who spoke to Good Morning America shortly after the incident, recalled his wife's last words, ""The last thing I remember her saying was she wanted the night to never end.""Komoroski's sentencing is expected to be finalised soon, bringing a measure of closure to a case that has left a devastating mark on all involved.","Jamie Lee Komoroski, 26, pleaded guilty to felony DUI, reckless homicide, and DUI causing great bodily harm.

Israeli response and ongoing negotiations

Devastating toll of war

President-elect Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Hamas on Monday, demanding the immediate release of hostages held in Gaza.Writing on his Truth Social platform, Trump stated that if the hostages were not freed before his inauguration on January 20, 2025, there would be ""all hell to pay"" in the Middle East.“Everybody is talking about the hostages who are being held so violently, inhumanely, and against the will of the entire World, in the Middle East - But it’s all talk, and no action!

Release the hostages now!,"" he added, calling for the immediate release of those still in captivity.This marks Trump’s most direct comments on the issue since his election in November.According to Israeli officials, over 250 hostages were taken during Hamas-led attacks on October 7, 2023. Of these, approximately 100 remain in captivity, with some confirmed dead, reported the news agency Reuters.The assault, which left 1,200 dead, is considered the deadliest in Israel's history.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or his office has not commented on Trump’s statement as of now. However, President Isaac Herzog expressed gratitude, posting on X, ""Thank you and bless you, Mr. President-elect @realDonaldTrump. We all pray for the moment we see our sisters and brothers back home!""Hamas has reportedly linked any release of hostages to an end to Israel’s military operations in Gaza and a complete withdrawal from the territory.The Biden administration has engaged in extensive diplomacy, brokering a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, but Hamas has shown little willingness to negotiate for a broader peace deal, according to US officials cited by news agency AP.The conflict, which began with Hamas’ surprise attack, has devastated Gaza.As per Reuters, Israeli airstrikes have killed over 44,400 Palestinians, with nearly 90 per cent of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents displaced, as per the territory’s health ministry. The war has also levelled significant portions of the enclave.Trump’s threats came just hours after Israel confirmed the death of Omer Neutra, a dual US-Israeli citizen, whose remains are believed to still be in Gaza.Meanwhile, Hamas released a video of Edan Alexander, an Israeli soldier held hostage, urging Trump to secure the freedom of those captured.Trump’s allies hope for a hostage release deal before his return to office, but the situation remains tense, with both Israel and Hamas showing no signs of compromise.","US President-elect Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Hamas on Monday, demanding the immediate release of hostages held in Gaza.

Two non-profit advocacy groups -- Veterans for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for America -- both led by Hegseth have the recording apart from other evidence of financial mismanagement and inappropriate sexual advances. New Yorker reported that Hegseth had to step down from both organizations. Reacting to the fresh claims, Hegseth's lawyers said these outlandish claims must have come from a ""petty and jealous disgruntled former associate"".Hegseth has already been accused of a sexual assault incident that took place in 2017 but Hegseth said the incident was consensual. But since he was blackmailed during the Me Too movement, he had to pay the woman.New Yorker cited a previously undisclosed whistleblower report on Hegseth's tenure as the president of Concerned Veterans for America that said Hegseth was found intoxicated while acting in his official capacity and sometimes he needed to be carried out of the organization's events.At one such event, Hegseth had to be restrained from joining the dancers on the stage of a Louisiana strip club. Hegseth and some other members of his management team divided the female staff into two groups: the ""party girls"" and the ""not party girls"".In 2015, at a bar, Hegseth drunkenly chanted 'kill all Muslims"" during the early hours.In January 2016, Hegseth resigned from Concerned Veterans for America under pressure. He had no other jobs at that time. On his silent departure, he said, ""Sometimes it just makes sense to make a transition."" But the New Yorker cited sources who claimed he was made to resign because of his mismanagement and alcohol abuse.“I’ve seen him drunk so many times. I’ve seen him dragged away not a few times but multiple times.

PESHAWAR: The death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surged to 130, with at least six people killed and eight injured on Sunday, as clashes in the volatile Kurram district continued for the eleventh consecutive day.The clashes between Alizai and Bagan tribes in the district started on November 22, after an attack on a convoy of passenger vans near Parachinar in which 47 people were killed a day earlier. Several passengers who had sustained grave injuries succumbed later, raising the toll in the convoy killing to 57.Police said the situation remained tense, and violence persists despite a recent ceasefire agreement between the Sunni and Shia groups.The six new deaths reported on Sunday brought the death toll to 130, while the total number of injured rose to 186 after eight fresh injuries were reported.The 10-day truce brokered last week has been rendered ineffective by intermittent violence, which shows no signs of abating.A high-powered delegation, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry and IGP Akhtar Hayat Gandapur, had also negotiated a ceasefire last weekend, but violence resumed shortly afterwards.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi earlier planned to dispatch members of the grandpeace jirga (council of tribal leaders) from Kohat division to Kurram for engaging with leaders from both warring factions to negotiate peace.Addressing a gathering of political leaders and tribal elders in Kohat on Sunday, he called for strict action with public cooperation to make the region weapon-free through joint operations.He said he was ready to go to Kurram and stay there for as many days as the jirga suggested to ensure peace in the region.""No other country or province will resolve our issues. We must take responsibility for improving the situation ourselves,"" he said.Kundi announced an All-Parties Conference (APC) for peace and the province's rights and invited Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur to join it.The governor stressed the role of religious scholars in promoting peace, urging them to focus on unity.Several other leaders addressed the gathering, putting aside their ideological differences on other issues.The continued violence forced the closure of the main Peshawar-Parachinar Road for travel, and commuting at the Pak-Afghan Kharlachi border has also been suspended.The closure of the main arteries has created a scarcity of oil, food commodities and medicines in the region.The Kurram region is also experiencing a communication blackout, with mobile and internet services suspended and educational institutions closed.Police and other security forces personnel had been deployed in various parts of Lower Kurram, said Deputy Commissioner Javed Ullah Mehsud, adding that all-out efforts will be made for a truce in other areas today as well.""We are hopeful for progress on a ceasefire and reopening of transport routes,"" he stated.Previous efforts to mediate peace, including a seven-day truce brokered by provincial officials in November have failed to hold.","Death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surges to 130.

Recent operations have allegedly resulted in the forced disappearance of more than 50 people from areas such as Turbat, Dera Bugti, Sui, Barkhan, and Kalat.Among those recently subjected to enforced disappearances are Dr Zafar (son of Mohammad Rahim), Rahim Jan (son of Dr Zafar), Dr Mohammad Kareem (son of Bahram), Dangla (son of Haji Moj Bugti), Pir Mohammad (son of Pano Bugti), Ismail (son of Lalu Bugti), and Rashid Ahmad Khetran (son of Master Gul Mohammad Jan Bughio).In a recent military operation in Kalat, more than 40 people were reportedly arrested. However, due to communication blackouts, further details regarding the detainees are still unavailable, according to The Balochistan Post report.The Baloch Yakjheti Committee (BYC), a Baloch advocacy group, condemned the issue in a post on X, stating, ""The enforced disappearances of Baloch individuals are escalating daily. The Baloch nation is enduring the worst forms of oppression. With each passing day, disturbing reports of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances emerge. Hundreds of innocent individuals and their families are subjected to this cruel practice, and in many cases, these victims are executed.""The statement further condemned the silence of human rights organizations and the media, highlighting that the genocide of the Baloch people is intensifying while the world remains indifferent. The lives of the Baloch people hold no significance to anyone. State violence has reached its peak.In the statement posted on X, BYC stated, ""Today alone, eight Baloch individuals were forcibly disappeared from a single household, leaving behind no male member, including an elderly person, Dr. Zafar, and his son, Raheem Baloch. Additionally, five of Dr. Zafar's guests were abducted from his house. While Dr. Zafar was later released after severe humiliation and torture, the others remain forcibly disappeared.""The BYC expressed its grave concern, emphasizing that despite their peaceful efforts, the genocide they are resisting is rapidly intensifying.Vowing to continue its resistance movement, the BYC stated, ""We can never, and will never, remain indifferent while our people endure such brutality. BYC will continue to strengthen and expand the resistance movement against the ongoing Baloch genocide.""",At least 10 Baloch men have been reportedly forcibly disappeared by Pakistforces in separate incidents. One of the missing individual has been released and returned home.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh's interim government on Monday protested against a ""violent demonstration"" at its assistant high commission in Agartala, Tripura, and called for a thorough investigation into the incident.""The government of Bangladesh deeply resents the violent demonstration and attack by a large group of protesters early afternoon on the premises of the assistant high commission of Bangladesh in Agartala,"" Bangladesh's foreign ministry said in a statement.The foreign ministry's comments came hours after thousands of people took out a massive rally near the Bangladeshi mission in Tripura.The protest in Tripura on Monday was related to the arrest of ISKCON leader Chinmoy Krishna Das and attacks on the Hindu community in Bangladesh. The rally was taken out under the banner of Hindu Sangharsh Samity, an affiliate of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP).The Bangladesh foreign ministry, in its statement, also alleged that the protesters entered the mission’s premises after breaking through the main gate. It claimed that they vandalized the flagpole, desecrated the Bangladeshi national flag, and damaged property inside the complex.""The accounts received conclusively attest that the protesters were allowed to aggress into the premises by breaking down the main gate of Bangladesh assistant high Commission in a pre-planned manner,"" the statement said.Meanwhile, India described the breach of the Bangladesh assistant high commission premises by protesters as ""deeply regrettable.""

""They can send the peacekeeping force to Bangladesh and rescue our people,"" Banerjee said.Responding to Mamata's statement, Bangladesh's de facto foreign minister Touhid Hossain said, ""I don't know, I can't understand why Mamata Banerjee made such a statement. I know her personally, I have visited her home several times.""Relations between India and Bangladesh have faced challenges since the interim government led by Muhammad Yunus came to power after the removal of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August. India has expressed concerns over attacks on minorities, particularly Hindus, in Bangladesh.","Bangladesh's interim government on Monday protested against a ""violent demonstration"" at its assistant high commission in Agartala, Tripura.

Watch: Bangladeshi Hindus protest in Canada's Montreal in solidarity with Iskcon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/watch-bangladeshi-hindus-protest-in-canadas-montreal-in-solidarity-with-iskcon/articleshow/115894708.cms,"Bangladeshi Hindus staged a demonstration in support of Iskcon Bangladesh on Tuesday in Canada's Montreal. The demonstrators called upon the government to urge Bangladesh's interim government to safeguard minority rights .During the protest, people raised their voices demanding protection for minority communities. ""Peace and fraternity. We want peace. We want justice. We want to bring an end to the ongoing violence on the minority Hindus and other minority communities in Bangladesh. What is happening? Have you seen?"" said a representative from the Bangladeshi diaspora to ANI.Speaking to ANI, another person expressed concern about fundamentalist groups gaining control of institutions in the country. ""So you're asking me what's going on in Bangladesh? Well, there was a coup d'etat on August 5th, and the army took over, and they brought in Muhammad Yunus to be a smile face, but they let loose the gangs of Muslim fundamentalists to run in the streets, to attack people, to attack people in the courts. They're taking over the institutions, the educational institutions. So it's not a very pretty situation. They're attacking minority communities; they're also attacking people who were anywhere connected with the Awami League or with any of the other parties in their alliance. So this is a military government,"" he explained.Conservative party candidate Neil Obermann, who supported the demonstration, identified himself as an ally rather than a Bangladeshi. He emphasised his opposition to hatred in any form.""I'm here today because hate is not acceptable anywhere by anybody for any reason and what you see here today is strong community. I'm not from your community but I'm from a community that also suffers as a result of hate. Hate doesn't help us and that's why coming out, being strong, sending a message that we will not tolerate this is the only message. Every time I come out to an event I say the same thing. What happens to one community happens to another community. Be strong, stand tall and make sure people hear your voice,"" he said.The arrest of spiritual leader Chinmoy Krishan Das on alleged sedition charges in Bangladesh has sparked extensive protests against the interim administration, with minority groups claiming neglect of their interests.",Bangladeshi Hindus staged a demonstration in support of Iskcon Bangladesh on Tuesday in Canada's Montreal.
