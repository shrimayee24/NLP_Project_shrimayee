LUCKNOW: Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati on Thursday launched a sharp attack on the Samajwadi Party , accusing it of exploiting Dalits for political gains under the guise of its recent PDA (Pichhde, Dalit, Alpsankhyak) campaign. In a series of posts on X, the BSP leader said that the SP, much like other parties, was attempting to incite tension and violence by using Dalits as political tools.""It is well known that like other parties, SP too is trying to create an atmosphere of tension and violence by pushing forward Dalit individuals from their party. The controversial statements, blame games, and programmes being run under this strategy reflect their deeply selfish political motives,"" Mayawati wrote.She went on to warn the Dalit community , as well as backward and Muslim communities, against falling for SP's tactics.""SP can go to any extent for Dalit votes. Therefore, along with Dalits, backward and Muslim communities should also avoid being misled by them and falling prey to their political tricks,"" she stated.In her third post, Mayawati advised against attacking icons of other communities and instead encouraged focus on educating Dalits about their own history, referring to the controversy stoked by SP Rajya Sabha MP Ramji Lal Suman's remarks on Rajput ruler Rana Sanga.""Also, instead of opportunistic Dalits associated with such parties making comments on the history of others, if they enlighten people about the saints, gurus, and great personalities of their own community and their struggles, then that would be appropriate' because it is through this that people become truly capable,"" she said.The BSP chief's remarks come amidst a renewed pitch by the Samajwadi Party to consolidate support among backward classes, Dalits, and minorities in Uttar Pradesh.","Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati accuses Samajwadi Party of exploiting Dalits for political gains.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal BJP president and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar on Wednesday DGP Rajeev Kumar at Bhawani Bhawan in Kolkata, accompanied by victims of recent violence incidents in Murshidabad. After the meeting, Majumdar claimed that the ""call for riots was given from the loudspeaker of the masjid.""""... According to the victims, the call for riots was given from the loudspeaker of the masjid,"" BJP leader said, citing victims' accounts.Taking aim at Trinamool Congress-led state government, Majumdar further added, ""... The provocative statement made by Tawha Siddique is very shameful. This mentality is increasing with their percentage increase and change in demographics. This mentality is because they are being sheltered by Mamata Banerjee's government.""He said that a BJP-led government would not tolerate the misuse of religious institutions. ""If the BJP comes to power, the party will ban any religious place used for such activities,"" he said.The Union minister also alleged that the Popular Front of India (PFI) was active in Murshidabad, yet no arrests had been made by the state police. ""The victims of the violence have travelled a long way to reach Kolkata to tell the world what happened in Murshidabad,"" he added.Majumdar claimed that many residents from the violence-hit areas of Murshidabad and Shamsherganj have fled to Malda and are now living in refugee camps. ""After the riots in Murshidabad's Shamsherganj, people migrated to Malda and are living in refugee camps. 11 people from there have come here to express their pain and suffering before the people of the state,"" he told ANI.The violence reportedly erupted on April 11 during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act—a controversial law that has drawn criticism in parts of the state. In response, over 150 people have been arrested, and police presence has been strengthened in areas including Samserganj and Dhuliyan.Earlier on the same day, leader of opposition in Bengal, Suvendu Adhikari accused TMC leaders of orchestrating the communal violence . In a video statement shared on X, he named Dhulian Municipality chairman Md Inzamul Haque as a ""key instigator"".""There is clear evidence in the video that this person is involved in the riots. He should be arrested immediately and severely punished for this heinous crime. Why are they being left out?"" Adhikari said.He alleged a broader conspiracy, saying, ""From Mothabari to Dhulian, Trinamool Congress leaders are the main conspirators and catalysts of anti-Hindu riots. Such toxic politics of the Trinamool Congress is just an attempt to endanger Hindus and enrich their vote bank.""""They are the ones who are disturbing the peace by spreading hatred in society and inciting fundamentalists. Their hate speech and activities are directly responsible for creating riots. It is time to unmask these rioters!"" he added.Meanwhile, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee held a meeting with Muslim clerics in Kolkata, amid the ongoing protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act.","West Bengal BJP president and Union minister Sukanta Majumdar on Wednesday DGP Rajeev Kumar at Bhawani Bhawan in Kolkata, accompanied by victims of recent violence incidents in Murshidabad.

That very night, we were charged under Public Safety Act,” he said.Dulat’s claim appears in his forthcoming book “The Chief Minister and The Spy”, which has triggered a political storm in J&K. The former intelligence officer, who has written about his long friendship with Abdullah in earlier work, alleged that the NC chief supported the constitutional move in private, contradicting his party’s public position.NC has demanded the restoration of Article 370 and was the first to file a petition in the Supreme Court challenging its abrogation. Dulat’s revelation has placed the party on the defensive.Peoples Conference chairman Sajad Lone backed Dulat’s account, citing the former spymaster’s close ties with Abdullah. “He is virtually his alter ego,” Lone said. “I personally am not surprised. The August 2019 meeting of CM sahib and Farooq sahib with the PM was never a mystery for me.”Farooq Abdullah, his son CM Omar Abdullah, and NC MP Hasnain Masoodi had met PM Narendra Modi in New Delhi days before the abrogation.PDP politicians also weighed in. Iltija Mufti said the book confirmed long-held suspicions. “Dulat sahib, an ardent Abdullah supporter, has shared how Farooq sahib agreed with Delhi’s illegal move of abrogating Article 370,” she said. “There were doubts about what transpired between the Abdullahs and the PM days before J&K’s special status was revoked.”PDP’s Waheed Parra accused NC of political complicity. “While PDP faced the brunt of the state’s crackdown — with over 40 politicians jailed, dissent crushed, and journalists targeted — NC remained untouched,” he said. “There was no strong statement, no mass mobilisation. What followed instead was electoral opportunism.”NC spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq dismissed Dulat’s claim as a fabrication. “He writes many baseless things to make his book popular,” he said. “This is imagination, not fact.”Abdullah’s daughter Safia also rejected Dulat’s assertions. “I have never trusted Dulat. He was always a spy whose loyalty was only to himself,” she said. “He never cared who he threw under the bus with his books.”Dulat has earlier defended Abdullah in his books “Kashmir: The Vajpayee Years” and “A Life in the Shadows”, where he criticised Delhi for sidelining the veteran Kashmiri politician.","National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah rejected former RAW chief AS Dulat ’s claim that he privately supported the abrogation of Article 370. “His book has so many mistakes that I cannot describe them,” Abdullah said.

Melinda French Gates has opened up about her 2021 divorce from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, calling the split “necessary” despite her ex-husband recently describing it as the biggest regret of his life. In a January interview, Bill Gates said ending their 27-year marriage was ""at the top of the list"" when it came to personal failures. The couple, who married in 1994, officially parted ways in August 2021.Recently, in a candid interview with The Times, French Gates addressed those comments, saying: “If you can’t live your values out inside your most intimate relationship, it was necessary.” While she chose not to directly respond to her ex-husband’s remarks, she noted: “I don’t even quite know what to make of that statement, so I’m not going to comment on what he says. He’s got his own life. I have my life now. I am very happy.”French Gates also spoke about the emotional toll of the divorce, revealing she suffered panic attacks during the separation. “When you’re leaving a marriage, it’s very, very hard. And the negotiations were tough,” she said.She shared that her first panic attack occurred in 2014 while having lunch with Gates, prompting her to begin therapy. “I’d heard of people having panic attacks and I didn’t know if it was a real thing,” she said.Initially skeptical of therapy, French Gates admitted she later came to understand its value. “It doesn’t mean I’m damaged,” she explained. “It means I’ve been through some difficult things that I need to figure out.”The former couple share three adult children—Jennifer, 28, Rory, 25, and Phoebe, 22—and are now grandparents to two. While Bill Gates has been dating Paula Hurd, widow of former Oracle CEO Mark Hurd, since 2022, French Gates confirmed she is currently single and enjoying the dating scene.","Melinda French Gates has opened up about her 2021 divorce from Microsoft co- founder Bill Gates.

TEL AVIV: The UN's humanitarian affairs agency's (OCHA) on Thursday updated on the situation in Gaza amid severe food shortages due to the Israeli military's punitive blockade on all aid entering the war-torn territory, Al Jazeera reported.According to OCHA, in March, 3,696 Palestinian children were newly admitted for acute malnutrition, which marked a stark increase compared with the number in February, which was 2,027, as per Al Jazeera.""Food consumption in Gaza has sharply deteriorated due to the blockade on the entry of humanitarian aid and other critical supplies now in its seventh week,"" OCHA said. ""Consumption of key food groups - such as meat, poultry, dairy, vegetables, and fruits - remains critically low,"" it added.Lack of access to water in Gaza is also fuelling ""a severe survival crisis with far-reaching public health and protection consequences. Water is essential for survival, yet access to safe water has become dangerously limited,"" the OCHA report states.The US special envoy for hostage affairs, Adam Boehler, told Al Jazeera that a ceasefire in Gaza will only be possible once all the captives being held by Hamas in the Palestinian enclave are released.Boehler's statement comes as ceasefire negotiations continue amid the Israeli military's intense renewed assault on Gaza. The envoy emphasised that Hamas releasing the remaining captives remains a non-negotiable precondition for any lasting truce.Medical sources told Al Jazeera that at least 35 people have been killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza since early on Wednesday, and more devastating strikes have been reported in recent hours, Al Jazeera reported.The United Nations said an estimated 5,00,000 people have been ""newly displaced or uprooted once more"" in Gaza since Israel broke the ceasefire with Hamas on March 18.Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz said his country's ""policy is clear"" and preventing all humanitarian aid from entering Gaza is a ""tool"" to pressure Hamas.Gaza's Health Ministry says at least 51,025 Palestinians have been confirmed dead and 116,432 wounded in Israel's war on Gaza since it began 18 months ago.The Gaza government media office updated its death toll to more than 61,700, saying thousands of people missing under the rubble are presumed dead. At least 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attacks, and more than 200 were taken captive, as per Al Jazeera.","In March, 3,696 Palestinian children were newly admitted for acute malnutrition.

Family says ICE agents smashed car window in seizing Guatemalan man who's seeking asylum,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/family-says-ice-agents-smashed-car-window-in-seizing-guatemalan-man-whos-seeking-asylum/articleshow/120366426.cms,"Marilu Domingo Ortiz, whose husband was taken into custody by ICE agents (AP)

NEW BEDFORD: A Massachusetts family is demanding answers from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, complaining its agents smashed a car window with a hammer and detained a man who they claim had applied for asylum. A lawyer for the family also claims agents were not looking for Juan Francisco Mendez when they grabbed him Monday in New Bedford, Massachusetts, as he drove to a dental appointment.The lawyer, Ondine Galvez-Sniffin, told The Associated Press during an interview that the agents claimed they were looking for another man with a different name before they dragged him and his wife out of the car.The incident, recorded on video by Mendez's wife Marilu Domingo Ortiz, shows ICE agents using a hammer to smash the car window and then seize Ortiz. The family believes Mendez is being held at a facility in Dover, New Hampshire.""When I arrived on the scene, my client's wife was sobbing. She was crying. She was shaking,"" Galvez-Sniffin said, adding that Mendez yelled ""Help Me"" in Spanish as he was driven away in handcuffs.""I walked over to the car and I see the busted window, the glass all over the back seat, and I was shocked,"" the lawyer added. ""I've been doing immigration work for 27 years and this was the first time that I saw such violent drastic measures being taken.""A spokesperson for ICE did not return repeated messages seeking comment.Another lawyer for Mendez, Ryan Sullivan, said a federal judge in New Hampshire ruled Wednesday that the government must give his attorneys 72 hours notice before moving him anywhere. Sullivan believes that is enough time to determine next steps in his case.Ortiz and her 9-year-old son have already been given protection under an asylum status over fears of facing persecution if they returned home to Guatemala. Mendez was in the process of applying for what is called derivative asylum, where you can get asylum if a family member already has it.The woman said she felt ""scared"" when ICE broke into their car and never expected someone from her family would be detained like this.""We came here to do honest work. To fight for our family,"" Ortiz said through a translator. ""What they did, or what they're doing right now, no, it's not fair. We don't deserve that treatment.""Ortiz said she was worried about the toll the detention was taking, especially on her son.""He has already stopped eating because of what we're going through,"" she said. ""I just hope that they release my husband so he can come back with us and that my son can be with him as well.""New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell, in a post on X, said the incident ""raises questions that require clear answers,"" including why local police weren't alerted beforehand. He also questioned whether ICE agents are targeting criminals as the Trump administration promised or, rather, ""engaging in an indiscriminate round-up of individuals with uncertain immigration status.""Galvez-Sniffin said Mendez had been in the country for four years and worked in the seafood industry in New Bedford. He had no criminal record, she said, and was in the process of applying for asylum. He had been fingerprinted in December, she said, adding nothing turned up in terms of a criminal record.""There really was no reason to treat him the way that he and his wife were treated."" Galvez-Sniffin said, adding that agents refused to look at the paperwork showing he had applied for asylum.""My biggest concern, his family's biggest concern is getting him back,"" she said. ""He has no criminal background and everything to stay for in this country.""The incident comes as the governor and law enforcement officials in New England have raised concerns about the tactics ICE is using to detain people.Last month, ICE agent Brian Sullivan took Wilson Martell-Lebron, 49, into custody as he was leaving court. Boston Municipal Court Judge Mark Summerville found Sullivan in contempt, arguing that he deprived Martell-Lebron of his rights to due process and fair trial.That case has since been dropped but the detention outside court while Martell-Lebron was on trial prompted Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden to call the actions of ICE ""troubling and extraordinarily reckless.""Tufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk of Turkiye, 30, is also challenging her detention by ICE. A video account shows her walking on a street in a Boston suburb as she is surrounded by immigration officials. Ozturk is heard screaming as they take her cellphone and is seen getting handcuffed. Her lawyers have called for her immediate release.","Juan Francisco Mendez and his wife Marilu Domingo Ortiz were taken into custody Monday in New Bedford, Massachusetts.

Van Hollen speaks to members of El Salvador's press after meeting with Vice President Félix Ulloa

US senator and democrat Chris Van Hollen travelled to El Salvador this week and met its vice president Felix Ulloa on Wednesday in a bid to secure the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia , a Maryland resident mistakenly deported under the Trump administration.The senator, however, was denied access to Garcia , who remains imprisoned in a notorious facility in his home country. CECOT, a high-security prison is known for human rights violations. Attempts to involve the US embassy also failed to secure family contact or visitation.Speaking with reporters, Hollen said he declined a tour of the prison, stressing he was only interested in seeing the man held inside.“I asked the vice-president if I could meet with Mr Abrego Garcia. And he said, well, you need to make earlier provisions to go visit Cecot,” Van Hollen said. “I’m asking president Bukele under his authority as president of El Salvador to do the right thing and allow Mr Abrego Garcia to walk out of a prison — a man who’s charged with no crime, convicted of no crime,"" he added.Van Hollen said he offered to return next week to meet Garcia, but vice-president Ulloa told him he could not promise that either. Ulloa also said he could not arrange a phone call between Garcia and his family. When the senator asked if he could speak to him himself, Ulloa replied that the request would have to come from the US embassy.Hollen also claimed the Salvadoran government is being paid to hold deportees like Abrego Garcia, while criticising the Trump administration for falsely labelling Garcia as a gang member, saying, “He’s charged with no crime and convicted of no crime.”The US supreme court has already directed the federal government to arrange Abrego Garcia’s return, but no action has been taken by either American or Salvadoran officials.Hollen's trip follows El Salvador's president Bukele’s recent visit to Washington, where he stood with US president Trump and refused to release Abrego Garcia.Garcia, 29, was living in Maryland with his wife and child under a special immigration status that protected him from being deported. But despite a judge’s order allowing him to remain in the United States due to fears of gang persecution in El Salvador, he was deported last month.The Trump administration later admitted the removal was the result of an “administrative error”, but has since refused to comply with the supreme court directive to bring him back.","US senator Chris Van Hollen travelled to El Salvador this week.

His wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, told Newsweek that the restraining order was filed “out of caution” and the issue had since been resolved through family counselling.The deportation, which took place on 15 March, sent Mr Ábrego García to El Salvador’s Cecot prison, notorious for housing alleged gang members. It was carried out despite a 2019 court order that protected him from removal. Maryland Judge Paula Xinis ruled the deportation violated that order and requested daily updates on efforts to bring him back. So far, the Department of Homeland Security has reported “no further updates.”El Salvador President Nayib Bukele , during his White House visit this week, said his government does not “have the power” to return him. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who travelled to El Salvador on Wednesday, said Salvadoran Vice President Félix Ulloa also declined to release Mr Ábrego García or allow a prison visit. “They should just let him go,” Van Hollen told reporters in San Salvador.Van Hollen called the case “unjust” and accused the Trump administration of “lying about Abrego Garcia.” The Supreme Court last week partially upheld a lower court ruling, confirming that the administration must aid in his release.The case has become a political flashpoint. Democrats are using it to criticise the Trump administration’s immigration policies and defiance of the judiciary. Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) said, “This is a constitutional crisis… This is about defying the Constitution and the Supreme Court.”A group of Democrats, including Sen. Cory Booker and Rep. Maxwell Frost, are now pushing for a congressional delegation to visit El Salvador and assess Mr Ábrego García’s condition. If not approved, lawmakers say they may travel independently.Meanwhile, the Trump administration is doubling down. At Wednesday’s briefing, Leavitt appeared alongside Patty Morin, whose daughter Rachel was murdered in 2023 by a man from El Salvador. The administration is citing such crimes to justify its stance on deportations and border security. “We need to protect our families, our borders, our children,” Morin said.","Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran national, was wrongly deported from Maryland last month.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has once again heaped praise on Elon Musk, calling him a visionary with ideas as bold as those of famed Soviet rocket engineer Sergei Korolev.Speaking to students during a visit to Moscow’s Bauman University on Wednesday, Putin said Musk is among the rare individuals “charged-up with a certain idea,” comparing his obsession with Mars to the early ambitions of Soviet space pioneers.“You know, there’s a man, he lives in the States, Musk, who, you could say, raves about Mars,” Putin told the students. “These are the kind of people who don’t often appear in the human population,” he added, highlighting that while such ideas may seem incredible now, “they often come to fruition after a while”.“Such people rarely appear… even though it may seem incredible to me today, after a time such ideas are often realised”, the Russian President further said.Sergei Korolev, to whom Musk was compared, is credited with launching the Soviet space programme, including the world’s first satellite, Sputnik and Vostok 1, which carried Yuri Gagarin into orbit in 1961.Putin’s remarks also likely reflect the warmer ties developing between Moscow and Washington under US President Donald Trump, who has appointed Musk as a top advisor.This isn’t the first time Putin has expressed admiration for Musk. During a widely watched interview with American journalist Tucker Carlson, he said, “There’s no stopping Elon Musk.He will do as he sees fit.” Referring to Neuralink, Musk’s brain-chip venture, the Russian leader added, “You’ll need to find some common ground with him… persuade him,” and called Musk a “smart person” with whom it is essential to reach an agreement due to the far-reaching implications of AI and human enhancement.At the 2023 Eastern Economic Forum, Putin had similarly called Musk “an extraordinary person” and a “talented businessman,” recognising his global influence and entrepreneurial success. “This is also recognised all over the world,” he remarked.Meanwhile, Musk continues to stir controversy over his views on the war in Ukraine. The SpaceX chief, who operates the Starlink satellite network used in conflict zones, recently accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of seeking a “forever war” and said Kyiv had gone “too far” in the conflict.",Vladimir Putin compares Elon Musk to Soviet space pioneer Sergei Korolev.

CULLMAN, ALABAMA: Two boats collided during a fishing tournament Wednesday in Alabama, killing three people, officials said.Major League Fishing said in a statement that a boating accident occurred during the second day of the Tackle Warehouse Invitational held on Lewis Smith Lake , a popular recreational destination about 70 miles (113 kilometers) north of Birmingham.The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, which is investigating the crash, said a bass fishing boat struck a center console-type vessel early Wednesday morning. Three people aboard the vessel were killed.Neither the state agency nor Major League Fishing released information about what led to the crash. Major League Fishing said in a statement that competitor Flint Davis was involved.The state agency said Joey M. Broom, 58, of Altoona, was fatally injured in the collision. John K.

North Korea on Thursday threatened to respond after the US sent B-1B bombers over the Korean Peninsula earlier this week. This deployment happened during joint exercises with South Korean aircraft, which Pyongyang sees as a direct military threat.The long-range bombers took part in aerial exercises with South Korea on Tuesday to demonstrate deterrence against North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, according to Seoul’s defence ministry.South Korean F-35 and F-16 fighter jets, along with American F-16s, participated in the drill. The ministry stated that the allies would continue strengthening their operational readiness in response to North Korea’s advancing arsenal, according to CBS News.Responding to the flyover, an unnamed spokesperson from North Korea’s defence ministry, quoted by state media, called it “an open threat to the security of our state and a grave provocation that raises the military tension in the region to an extreme dangerous level.”The official warned that Pyongyang would “deter by dint of powerful force the US aggressive attempt to permanently fix the malignant instability element in the security environment of the region,” as per news agency AP.The flyover coincided with the 113th birth anniversary of North Korea’s founder, Kim Il Sung—a date known as the “Day of Sun” and one of the most sacred holidays in the country. The timing is likely to further provoke Pyongyang, which has reacted strongly in the past to similar displays by the US, including with missile launches and fiery rhetoric, as per CBS News.Later on Thursday, South Korea’s Air Force announced the start of its biannual “Freedom Flag” exercises with the US, featuring 90 aircraft and other assets. The drills will continue for two weeks and are expected to intensify North Korea’s anger.Tensions have already been running high on the peninsula. Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of Kim Jong Un, recently dismissed US-led efforts to denuclearise North Korea as a “daydream” and reaffirmed Pyongyang's refusal to abandon its nuclear weapons programme. Her remarks came after a meeting among US, South Korean and Japanese diplomats who pledged to push forward denuclearisation talks.This week’s B-1B deployment marks the second such exercise since US President Donald Trump began his second term.In February, North Korea denounced a similar flyover as evidence of growing US-led hostility and responded with cruise missile tests. Trump has maintained that he has a “great relationship” with Kim Jong Un and has repeatedly expressed willingness to resume diplomacy, though North Korea has yet to publicly respond to his outreach.","US sent B-1B bombers over the Korean Peninsula earlier this week.

'I'm not Justin Trudeau,' Carney says after jab from Poilievre

The first French-language leaders’ debate of the 2025 Canadian election saw prime minister Mark Carney and conservative leader Pierre Poilievre face off over the pressing issue of how best to deal with US president Donald Trump Carney, who took over the Liberal party leadership in March, countered Poilievre’s claims about the need for change, by arguing that the central question of the upcoming election was who could best handle Trump, in the face of Trump’s aggressive tactics, including his trade war and his threats to make Canada the 51st state.Poilievre, in his criticism of Carney’s leadership, argued that the Liberals had been in power too long and that Carney, much like his predecessor Justin Trudeau, represented continuity rather than change.Responding to this, Carney said, ""Mr Poilievre is not Justin Trudeau. I’m not Justin Trudeau either. In this election the question is who is going to face Mr Trump.""When asked about Justin Trudeau during a news conference after the debate, Mark Carney said one key difference between them is his stronger focus on the economy. “There are many differences, but one of them is that I place much more emphasis on growing the economy,” he said.Trump’s threat has led to a rise in Canadian nationalism, which has given Carney’s Liberal party a boost in the polls ahead of the 28 April vote. The poll shift shows a clear change from earlier in the year, where the Conservatives held a significant lead. In January, a Nanos poll showed the Liberals trailing by 47% to 20%, but the most recent poll indicates that the Liberals now lead by 8 percentage points.The debate, held in Montreal—Canada’s second-largest city—was strategically important, as the French-speaking province of Quebec has 78 seats in the 343-seat House of Commons.The debate was moved up by two hours to avoid a scheduling conflict with a Montreal Canadiens hockey game, a sign of the cultural importance of the sport in Canada. The decision was reminiscent of the 2011 election when a similar request was made due to the same team’s playoff schedule.The English-language debate, scheduled for Thursday evening, will further clarify the stance of each leader as Canadians prepare to vote in one of the most consequential elections in recent years.","First French-language leaders' debate of the 2025 Canadian election saw prime minister Mark Carney and conservative leader Pierre Poilievre face off.

‘Karma’: Letitia James facing potential prosecution over alleged mortgage fraud

Who is Letitia James?

Letitia James is a Democrat and has served as New York’s attorney general since 2019, according to PBS.

She is the first Black woman elected to statewide office in New York.

Known for her aggressive legal stance, James gained national attention after filing a civil fraud lawsuit against Donald Trump, the Trump Organisation, and several of its executives in 2022.

That case led to a $454 million judgment, which Trump is currently appealing. James has remained a visible figure in the courtroom and the media throughout the proceedings.

This year, she has launched at least five legal challenges against the Trump administration, including a coalition-led lawsuit opposing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)’s access to Treasury systems and a separate suit against federal funding cuts to universities.

(This is a top Google Trends topic)

The Trump administration has accused New York Attorney General Letitia James of mortgage fraud, escalating tensions between the two sides. The allegations were revealed in documents obtained by Fox News, showing that the FHFA has referred the matter to the department of justice for possible criminal investigation.The referral, signed by FHFA director William Pulte, highlights two key claims. First, that James falsely listed a Virginia property as her principal residence. Second, she misrepresented a New York property as a four-unit structure instead of five — which may have qualified her for different loan terms. There is also an allegation that she listed her father as her husband on past documents.","The FHFA has referred the matter to the department of justice for possible criminal investigation.

'Investment is not an entitlement': Trump admin freezes $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard University,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-freezes-2-2-billion-federal-funding-over-white-houses-campus-anti-semitism-mandate/articleshow/120294516.cms,"Harvard University in Cambridge (File photo)

Poll Do you agree with the Trump administration's decision to freeze funding for Harvard? No, it undermines academic independence. Yes, it's necessary for accountability.

What the Trump administration wanted from Harvard?

Harvard's response the demands

The Trump administration announced Monday it will freeze $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts for Harvard after the university refused to comply with its policy demands concerning changes in its policies.The mandates, issued in an April 3 directive, required changes to university governance, hiring and admissions processes, the closure of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) offices, and cooperation with federal immigration screenings for international students.The Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism that suspended the fundings and grants cited concerns about elite universities’ commitment to civil rights and responsible use of taxpayer funds. ""Harvard's statement today reinforces the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities and colleges - that federal investment does not come with the responsibility to uphold civil rights laws,"" it said.""The disruption of learning that has plagued campuses in recent years is unacceptable. The harassment of Jewish students is intolerable. It is time for elite universities to take the problem seriously and commit to meaningful change if they wish to continue receiving taxpayer support,"" it added to it statement.In a letter dated April 11 to Harvard President Alan Garber, US officials accused Harvard of failing to uphold federal civil rights laws and academic standards that justify continued federal investment. The letter outlined a set of strict reforms the university must implement by August 2025. ""The United States has invested in Harvard University’s operations because of the value to the country of scholarly discovery and academic excellence. But an investment is not an entitlement. It depends on Harvard upholding federal civil rights laws, and it only makes sense if Harvard fosters the kind of environment that produces intellectual creativity and scholarly rigor, both of which are antithetical to ideological capture."" it said.""Harvard has in recent years failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment. But we appreciate your expression of commitment to repairing those failures and welcome your collaboration in restoring the University to its promise. We therefore present the below provisions as the basis for an agreement in principle that will maintain Harvard’s financial relationship with the federal government,"" it added while listing out the demands for the ivy league university which included governance and leadership demands, merit-based hiring reforms, international admissions reforms, discontinuation of DEI, whistleblower reporting and ensuring transparency.In its response, Harvard President Alan Garber declared the university would not “negotiate over its independence or its constitutional rights.” Garber claimed that while the university is committed to addressing discrimination, it rejects federal overreach into academic autonomy. “The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” Garber wrote in a message to the community, as per the Harvard Gazette. “No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,"" he added.Garber's response came after the government issued a list of requirements prior to announcing the funding freeze. These included detailed assessments of academic divisions and departments, evaluations of perspectives from students, faculty, and staff, as well as proposed changes to Harvard's administrative structure and recruitment procedures.Following the order, Harvard Law School professor Nikolas Bowie gave a statement to CNN’s News Central saying, “What the President of the United States is demanding of universities is nothing short of authoritarian."" “He is violating the First Amendment rights of universities and faculty by demanding that if universities want to keep this money, they have to suppress our speech and change what we teach and how we study,” he added.This action follows heightened tensions on campuses nationwide, particularly after pro-Palestinian protests erupted in response to Israel’s military operations in Gaza. Some demonstrations led to confrontations with law enforcement and pro-Israel counter-protesters.Republican leaders, including President Donald Trump, have equated certain activist groups with Hamas—the US-designated terrorist organization whose October 7, 2023 attack on Israel sparked the current conflict.In March, the US Department of Education launched investigations into 60 academic institutions over reports of anti-Semitic incidents.Despite revealing a £45 million operating surplus from £6.5 billion in revenue last fiscal year, Harvard firmly rejected demands it deemed excessive and outside federal authority. Garber reiterated that political interference in academic decisions is unacceptable, regardless of party affiliation.Representative Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican known for her staunch support of Jewish and Israeli causes, has been a vocal critic of Harvard’s leadership. She praised the funding freeze, calling Harvard emblematic of higher education’s decline.Unlike Harvard, Columbia University chose to comply with similar White House mandates, forfeiting $400 million in federal grants after failing to adequately protect Jewish students during protests. Columbia has since implemented new disciplinary policies and increased security measures.Meanwhile, immigration authorities have pursued action against Columbia-based pro-Palestinian organizers. Mahmoud Khalil is undergoing deportation proceedings, and Mohsen Mahdawi was detained during his US citizenship interview.","The Trump administration announced Monday it will freeze $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts for Harvard.

Dan Caldwell , a senior adviser to US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth , was escorted out of the Pentagon on April 15, 2025, following his suspension amid an ongoing probe into multiple unauthorised disclosures of sensitive information. The removal, part of a broader crackdown inside the Department of Defense, signals a deepening crisis for the Trump administration’s national security leadership—and brings renewed scrutiny to the now-infamous “SignalGate” scandal.Caldwell wasn’t the only casualty. Darin Selnick, the Pentagon’s Deputy Chief of Staff and another political appointee, was also placed on administrative leave and removed from the building. According to defense officials, both men had their security credentials suspended pending the outcome of the investigation.At the centre of the investigation is a string of unauthorised disclosures that include highly sensitive operational information. Among the leaks under scrutiny:While the exact details of each leak are still classified, sources familiar with the probe say the information appeared across both encrypted group chats and informal communications shared with Trump-aligned media outlets. One such Signal chat — the focus of SignalGate — included top-level officials like Vice President JD Vance , National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.The group accidentally included a journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, who had been added by mistake during a group update. Unaware of the breach, members of the chat freely discussed targeting timelines for US strikes on the Houthis in Yemen, drone launch windows, and even posted celebration messages after successful missions. Goldberg would later publish excerpts in The Atlantic, triggering a national firestorm over operational security.Caldwell, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Iraq, was a well-known figure in conservative national security circles. Before joining the Pentagon, he worked at Defense Priorities, a think tank sceptical of US interventionism, and held a senior role at Concerned Veterans for America — an organisation previously headed by Hegseth.He was brought into the Pentagon as a senior adviser shortly after Hegseth’s confirmation in early 2025 and quickly became one of the most influential figures in the department. He advised on Ukraine policy and, according to several defense officials, was the point person for Yemen-related military coordination.But his influence was matched by his ideological zeal. Known for his hardline stance against the so-called “deep state,” Caldwell frequently clashed with career officials and intelligence officers, particularly those advocating for more cautious engagement in global conflicts.According to Politico and Reuters, Hegseth himself named Caldwell in the Signal chat as the Pentagon’s go-to contact for the US’s Yemen campaign. The chat logs allegedly show Caldwell confirming target coordinates, celebrating confirmed kills, and—critically—forwarding operational documents that may not have been properly cleared.Though Signal is end-to-end encrypted, the group chat proved vulnerable not because of technology, but human error. Goldberg’s inclusion gave a real-time journalist access to a high-level, unfiltered war room—one that believed it was talking among trusted peers.Hegseth’s office had signed a memo in March authorising the Pentagon’s Director of Defense Intelligence to probe leaks and even conduct polygraphs. Ironically, the biggest breach came from within Hegseth’s own circle.Selnick’s departure, though less publicised, is just as significant. Like Caldwell, he was a Trump loyalist with previous experience in the first Trump administration, where he served in the Department of Veterans Affairs and the White House.He had also worked at Concerned Veterans for America and briefly carried out the responsibilities of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness — giving him considerable influence over military staffing and policy implementation.Defense officials have not confirmed the precise role Selnick played in the SignalGate debacle, but his removal on the same day suggests that he too was entangled in the unauthorised disclosure network—if not the chat itself, then parallel channels of communication.The SignalGate scandal lays bare the operational dysfunction inside Trump’s Pentagon. It has raised alarms about the use of encrypted messaging apps for real-time military coordination without adequate safeguards. That an accidental chat inclusion could compromise classified strike plans speaks to a failure not of technology but of judgment.It also underlines the blurred boundaries between media, government, and political activism in the Trump administration’s second term. Caldwell and Selnick are part of a generation of ideologically driven appointees who view bureaucracy with suspicion and traditional protocols as obstacles to be bypassed, not rules to be followed.The Pentagon’s Inspector General has launched a formal investigation, and watchdog groups such as American Oversight have filed lawsuits alleging violations of the Federal Records Act and Administrative Procedure Act. Legal experts warn that criminal charges are not off the table if it’s found that classified material was knowingly disseminated.Neither Caldwell nor Selnick has commented publicly, and the Pentagon has declined to offer further details while the investigation is ongoing.But their removal signals a likely housecleaning within Hegseth’s inner circle, especially as Congress prepares hearings into the leak and the broader question of how military secrets are handled in the age of encrypted group chats and political warfare.SignalGate is already being called the Trump Pentagon’s biggest internal scandal since the Iraq intelligence debacles of the early 2000s — only this time, the threat didn’t come from a foreign mole or a rogue general. It came from a chat bubble with too many “read” receipts.","Dan Caldwell, a senior adviser to US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, was escorted out of the Pentagon on April 15, 2025, following his suspension amid an ongoing probe.

US President Donald Trump hugged Patty Morin , the grieving mother of Rachel Morin , during an emotional moment at the White House on Wednesday, reports the Daily Mail.“She’s been through hell,” Trump said, as he held her in the Oval Office .Rachel Morin, a mother of five from Maryland , was raped and murdered while hiking. Her killer, Victor Martinez-Hernandez , a fugitive from El Salvador , was later convicted of the crime.Trump invited Morin to the White House as part of his push to defend strict deportation policies . Comforting her during the meeting, he told her, “Your daughter is looking down proud of you, you know that… she’s proud of you.”The appearance came just hours after White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt slammed Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen for flying to El Salvador to visit Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia. Garcia, a Maryland man and father of three, was deported in March — a move Van Hollen claims was mistaken. However, the Trump administration insists Garcia is tied to a violent gang.“Maryland Democrat Senator Chris Van Hollen rushed to Dulles Airport this morning to fly to El Salvador, potentially using taxpayer dollars to demand the release of deported illegal alien, MS-13 terrorist,” Leavitt told reporters, calling the trip “appalling and sad.”Leavitt then brought out Patty Morin as a “special guest” to make her voice heard.Morin then criticised Van Hollen, saying that the Maryland senator ""barely acknowledged"" the death of her daughter.“The senator from Maryland who didn’t even acknowledge — or barely acknowledged — my daughter and the brutal death that she endured, leaving her five children without a mother, chose to use my tax money to fly to El Salvador to bring back a person who isn’t even an American citizen,” she said.Furthermore, Morin said that President Trump wants to remove criminals from the country, and as American citizens, it is their duty to do the same.“These are the kind of criminals President Trump wants to remove from our country. These are the kind of criminals that we need to remove from our country. We are American citizens. Why should we allow people like this, violent criminals that have no conscience at all to murder our mothers, our sisters, our daughters? I don’t understand,"" said Morin.","Patty Morin, the grieving mother of Rachel Morin, met with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Wednesday.

White House press briefing: Patty Morin shares story of her daughter's murder

Patty Morin , the mother of Rachel Morin murdered in Maryland, made a rare and emotional appearance at the White House on Wednesday. Her daughter was killed in 2023. The man found guilty recently, Victor Martinez-Hernandez, had illegally entered the United States from El Salvador.Morin, invited as a “special guest,” addressed reporters alongside White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt .“Why should we allow violent criminals that have no conscience at all to murder our mothers, our sisters, our daughters?” she asked. “We are American citizens. We need to protect our families, our borders, our children.”She also urged the press to report the truth: “Please tell the truth. Tell how violent it really is. This is about protecting our children. It’s more than just politics or votes or just anything,” she said before leaving the room.The sudden briefing appeared to be a direct response to criticism over the mistaken deportation of another Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, as Leavitt began the briefing by attacking Democrats for criticising the deportation of Garcia, who had no connection to Morin’s case.Abrego Garcia, 29, was living in Maryland with his wife and child under a special immigration status that protected him from being deported. But despite a judge’s order allowing him to remain in the United States due to fears of gang persecution in El Salvador, he was deported last month.The Trump administration later admitted the removal was the result of an “administrative error”, but has since refused to comply with a Supreme Court directive to bring him back.","Patty Morin, the mother of Rachel Morin murdered in Maryland, made a rare and emotional appearance at the White House on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: The Bloach rebels hijacked Pakistan 's Jaffar Express last month using US weapons, which American forces left behind during the hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, reported Washington Post.Weapons were left behind by United States forces following their 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. Among the weapons recovered from the scene was an M4A1 carbine rifle manufactured by Colt, an American arms maker, ARY News reported.The rifle's serial number reportedly confirmed that it was originally supplied to US forces in Afghanistan and later left behind during the chaotic withdrawal.The Bloach Liberation Army (BLA) opened fire on a passenger train in southwestern Pakistan on March 11, injuring the train driver. The train with over 400 passengers aboard was traveling from Quetta in Balochistan province to Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa when it came under attack.Rescue teams and security forces arrived at the scene, launching an operation which went on for more than 24 hours. The Pakistan security officials said that no passenger was hurt and “the number of passengers who fell victim to the barbarism of the terrorists is 21.”""On March 11 in Bolan, terrorists targeted a railroad track around 1pm and blew it up and stopped the Jaffar Express.

Baloch separatists kill 8 Pakistanis in Iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/baloch-separatists-kill-8-pakistanis-in-iran/articleshow/120262403.cms,"ISLAMABAD:

Eight Pakistani car mechanics were shot dead in Iran late Saturday, sparking outrage and deepening fears that the country was becoming a hub for anti-Pakistan militants after Afghanistan.Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack in Sistan-Baluchestan province, escalating tensions between the neighbouring countries as Pakistan demanded swift action. The eight workers hailed from Punjab -- Pakistan’s most populous province -- and were killed at a workshop in Mehrestan district, near Afghanistan’s border, Pakistani authorities said.BNA framed the killings as retaliation against perceived Punjabi dominance in Balochistan’s economic and political spheres. “We will not allow outsiders to exploit our land and resources,” BNA said in an online statement, echoing long-standing Baloch grievances over resource exploitation and marginalisation. The outfit has aligned itself with the broader Baloch insurgency led by groups like Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif called the attack “barbaric”. “We demand the perpetrators be brought to justice swiftly,” he said, urging Tehran to act. Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to help the victims’ families and repatriate the bodies. Foreign minister Ishaq Dar issued a similar condemnation. “This attack challenges our sovereignty. We cannot allow our citizens to be targeted abroad,” Dar said.Iran’s response was measured but conspicuously vague. Ambassador Reza Amiri Moghadam condemned the killings as “inhumane and cowardly”, calling terrorism a “chronic plight” that demands regional cooperation. Yet, Tehran offered no concrete assurances of cracking down on groups like BNA, prompting scepticism in Islamabad.Thousands of Pakistanis, particularly from economically deprived areas, travel to Iran on a regular basis to take up informal jobs in sectors such as vehicle repairs, construction, and agriculture.In Jan 2024, nine Pakistani labourers were killed and three critically injured in a similar attack in Saravancity, also located in Iran’s southeastern border region. Like in the latest killings, the victims in that case worked in an automobile repair shop. These murders occurred at a time when Pakistan and Iran were attempting to repair diplomatic relations after tit-for-tat missile and drone attacks.","Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack.

The resolution also demanded an immediate halt to any plans or work related to the project until an agreement with all provincial governments, especially Sindh, was reached to ensure that the province's rights were fully protected and respected.While addressing a PPP rally in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh on the anniversary of Pakistan's former Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's execution, Bhutto said that the PPP had always fought for peoples' rights to water, Dawn reported.He said, ""The workers of the PPP have grown old fighting for the fair distribution of water.""

He stated that the IRSA report shows there are water shortages in Punjab also, Dawn reported.He said, ""If we take water from here (Sindh), it'll harm farmers in South Punjab.

"5.8 magnitude earthquake strikes Pakistan, tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/5-8-magnitude-earthquake-strikes-pakistan-no-immediate-damage-reported/articleshow/120227756.cms,"Representative image

Poll Do you believe that Pakistan is adequately prepared for earthquakes? No Yes

A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.Tremors were felt across many parts of the Valley, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or property damage. The earthquake occurred at a depth of 10 kilometres, with coordinates of 33.63 degrees North latitude and 72.46 degrees East longitude.According to the National Center for Seismology (NCS), the recent earthquake struck at a shallow depth of 10km, increasing the likelihood of aftershocks.Shallow earthquakes are typically more dangerous than deeper ones because the seismic waves travel a shorter distance to the surface, causing stronger ground shaking and potentially more damage to structures and higher casualties.Pakistan, located on the boundary of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, is one of the most seismically active countries. The nation frequently experiences destructive earthquakes due to its position on major fault lines. Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and Gilgit-Baltistan lie on the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir are on the north-western edge of the Indian plate. The collision of these plates makes the region highly susceptible to violent earthquakes.Earlier, Pakistan’s neighbor Tajikistan was also jolted by a 4.2 magnitude earthquake.","A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.
