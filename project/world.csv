KOLKATA: Sanjay Roy responded “I can’t say” to 56 out of 104 questions from prosecution, but said “yes” when asked if he was the person seen in CCTV footage at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital ’s chest department on Aug 9.This key admission played a critical role in linking him to the rape and murder of a 31-year-old resident doctor in the hospital’s seminar hall, where she had retired to rest after a 16-hour shift.The Sealdah trial court convicted and sentenced him to life imprisonment Monday. In his 172-page judgment, additional sessions judge Anirban Das highlighted Roy’s incriminating admission during the trial.Judge Das pointed out that although Roy denied many questions related to the crime, he did not challenge the “truthfulness” of the CCTV footage. “He was cautioned that the replies may or may not be used for or against him and even after understanding everything he gave the reply by supporting the contents of the footage. So, the version of the accused became relevant in this case,” the judge said.The court examined a specific frame from the CCTV camera located in the chest department on the third-floor. While the crime scene was nearby but outside the camera’s coverage area, footage captured Roy leaving at 4.31am on Aug 9, holding a helmet but without his Bluetooth earphones. Roy admitted to being in the department from 4.03am to 4.31 am, a fact that the judge emphasised as establishing his presence at the crime scene.In his defence, Roy claimed he was at the hospital to visit a fellow civic volunteer undergoing surgery, though he couldn’t provide the patient’s identity. Roy said he left his helmet and earphones in the male ward. However, the judge found this explanation lacking, as Roy could not substantiate his presence in the male ward nor identify the supposed patient.When confronted with evidence that his saliva was found on the victim’s body, Roy argued that it was planted after he was tortured in police custody. Judge Das dismissed this claim, saying the victim had been cremated by the time Roy was taken into custody on Aug 10.The defence’s assertion that Roy’s facial injuries were from boxing practice was also refuted by forensic experts . They said the injuries were scratch marks, not blunt trauma typical of boxing. “This means that the accused and his counsels were swimming in a whirlpool and could not understand what would be appropriate defence. All the defence went against the accused,” the judge said.","The Sealdah trial court convicted and sentenced him to life imprisonment Monday.

MUMBAI: Shariful Fakir , arrested for the attack on actor Saif Ali Khan at his Bandra residence, told investigators that Khan had locked him in a tight hold from the front. Shariful said that he then stabbed Khan in his back repeatedly to escape.The police will record Khan's statement once he is discharged from Lilavati Hospital , where he is recuperating.A 150-member police team tracked down Shariful, a Bangladeshi national living illegally here, from a marshy area at the edge of Thane in a massive combing operation on Sunday. Investigators are likely to recreate the sequence of events leading to the crime.""We have to be mindful that the actor and his family are traumatised after everything that they have been through. All precautions will be taken while recreating the sequence of events at the crime scene,"" an officer said.Forensic experts were able to lift 19 fingerprints from the crime scene after the offence occurred on Thursday. The fingerprints were lifted from the bathroom window, pipes and a ladder that the accused had accessed to gain entry to the flat.The prints will now be verified against Shariful's fingerprints to find our if there is a match. ""After the fingerprints were lifted on the day of the offence, they were run through the national database but no match was found. The reason could be that Shariful does not have a prior crime record in the country,"" an officer said.The police have strong reason to believe that Shariful might have had a prior criminal record in Bangladesh. ""He had carried tools used for burglaries such as hammers et cetera, besides the knife. The CCTV footage shows him going up the building without footwear but wearing his shoes on his way downstairs. This indicates he was careful to carry his shoes in his bag on his way up as he had climbed up the pipes,"" an officer said.Back in Bangladesh, Sharif has two brothers. His parents also live there. He is not married and has no relatives here. The police have not found any Indian identification documents on him.""A day after the crime, Shariful saw his CCTV images being flashed on television news. He panicked on realising that the police were on his trail. He went into hiding in Thane with plans to board the Geetanjali Express to Howrah and cross the border to Bangladesh,"" an officer said.Before Shariful could execute his escape, a police team tracked him down.A team of 75 policemen involved in the case were felicitated on Monday by joint police commissioner (law and order) Satyanarayan.","Shariful Fakir, a Bangladeshi national, was arrested for assaulting actor Saif Ali Khan at his Bandra residence.

He entered India illegally and adopted multiple identities, including ""Vijay Das.""

He worked in Mumbai for five to six months, employed by a housekeeping agency.

Court grants 5-day remand; lawyer says proper investigation not done

NEW DELHI: Nearly three days after Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan was stabbed at his Bandra residence in the early hours of Thursday, the Mumbai Police have arrested the alleged main attacker, Mohd Shariful Islam Shehzad , a Bangladeshi national. Following two misidentifications and extensive investigations, police confirmed on Sunday that Shehzad, who had entered India illegally, was using multiple aliases. It was revealed that he had entered Saif Ali Khan's house with the intension of theft during which the stabbing occurred.The attack, which left Khan with severe stab wounds to his thoracic spine, unfolded when the intruder confronted a staff member inside the actor's apartment. Khan reportedly intervened, leading to a violent altercation. Following the incident, the actor was rushed to Lilavati Hospital, where emergency surgery was performed to remove a 2.5-inch blade. While Khan is now ""out of danger"" and recovering in a regular hospital room, his condition continues to be closely monitored.In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Mumbai Police questioned two individuals in separate locations — one in Chhattisgarh and another in Mumbai — but both were later cleared of involvement. The breakthrough came when Shehzad was apprehended in Thane, allegedly while planning to flee to his native Bangladesh, news agency ANI reported.A case has been registered against Shehzad under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, including charges for grievous assault and housebreaking, as well as provisions of the Passport Act for his illegal entry into India . During a press conference, Deputy Commissioner of Police Zone 9, Dixit Gedam revealed that Shehzad had been using aliases such as Vijay Das and Bijoy Das, and had worked in Mumbai for the past five to six months in various housekeeping jobs.After his arrest, a Mumbai court granted a 5-day police remand in connection with the attack case. After the hearing, Shehzad’s advocate, Sandeep Shekhane said that the police’s statement — that Shehzad had entered India six months ago — was incorrect, asserting that he had been residing in Mumbai for over seven years with his family. Shekhane also cited a violation of section 43A, claiming a lack of proper investigation into the case.""A police custody for 5 days has been granted. The court has asked the police to submit a report within 5 days. The police have no proof that he is a Bangladeshi. They said that he came here 6 months ago, it is a wrong statement.""""He has been living here for more than 7 years. His family is in Mumbai... This is a clear-cut violation of 43A. No proper investigation has been done,"" he said","Mohd Shariful Islam Shehzad, a Bangladeshi national, is accused of stabbing Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan.

No confirmation of participation of Indians in Russian forces: Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-confirmation-of-participation-of-indians-in-russian-forces-ukraine/articleshow/117438494.cms,"Representative photo

A week after news that an Indian citizen from Kerala, Binil TB, died fighting for Russian forces in the Ukraine war, Andriy Yermak, Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, told TOI Kyiv had no confirmation of the participation of Indians in Russian forces . Speaking to Indian journalists virtually from Kyiv, Yermak acknowledged that citizens of other nations had been duped into fighting for Russia in the war.“We know about North Koreans. It is public. We know about Cubans. Unfortunately, these people are lied to and then they appeared in Russia. When we have confirmation that some citizens of another country participated on the side of Russia, we have worked very properly, very openly through diplomatic channels and informed the respective country it’s not right. It’s against good relations between countries.”Binil and others like him were either promised jobs in Europe or were put onto employment in Russia’s military support services by middlemen. At a press briefing last week, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said there were 126 cases of Indians serving in the Russian army, of which 96 had been discharged and returned to India. However, 12 Indians serving in the Russian forces have died in the ongoing war and the whereabouts of 16 others are not known.Also read:Yermak also sought India’s support in bringing back Ukrainian children forcibly deported by Russia. According to Kyiv, around 20,000 children had been forcibly taken from Russian-occupied territories, separated from their relatives, and pushed into Russia’s vast foster-care and adoption system.“I think it's possible to increase the pressure on Russia and to find new strategies to bring the kids back. The children have to be back without any conditions.

Victim was gang-raped:

A woman was hiding behind curtains

Impossible for Roy to act alone:

No signs of struggle in seminar hall:

No one noticed anything amiss at nursing station

Roy was tortured into confession:

Multiple allegations and theories surfaced after the rape and murder of a 31-year-old resident doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Aug 9 last year. Judge Anirban Das of Sealdah sessions court addressed these theories in a 172-page judgment, providing reasons to debunk each one while sentencing convict Sanjay Roy to life imprisonment Monday.Judge Das ruled out this possibility. “Rape was committed by only one person, and there was no evidence of gang rape,” the judgment reads.The autopsy report supported this, showing no fractures on the victim’s body, indicating that the assault was carried out by a single person, the judge said. The court acknowledged the prosecution’s failure to specify the nature of a white thick liquid found during the examination, but it was confirmed that it was not semen.: The victim’s parents had argued that another woman was involved, citing DNA profiles found during autopsy. However, Judge Das pointed out the poor sterilisation practices at the facility, which led to contamination. Other female bodies were lying on the floor.“The nipple swab contains the full DNA profile of the accused as well as of the victim and a very negligible profile of another female,” he said, ruling out the involvement of any other person.The court found that the cause of death was due to manual strangulation associated with smothering, both of which Roy could have carried out alone. The autopsy team confirmed the manner of death was homicidal and caused by these actions.While some items were undisturbed, such as the victim’s mobile phone, laptop, and exercise book, Judge Das highlighted other evidence indicating a struggle. “The water bottle was found lying on the dais, and a red blanket was used as a pillow,” he said. “I have no confusion in my mind to hold that the seminar room, more particularly the dais, again more precisely the mattress on the dais… was the scene of the crime.”: The defence questioned why the nursing station did not notice Roy entering the chest department. Judge Das dismissed this as speculative, saying: “In the wee hours of Aug 9, it was not the time of joining any duties. It is very hard to take into consideration such an imaginary argument.”The court found no evidence to support the claim that Roy was tortured into confessing. “It was not placed anywhere during the cross-examination that the accused was beaten while in police custody,” Judge Das wrote in his verdict, adding that no such allegations were presented during the investigation process.","Multiple allegations and theories surfaced after the rape and murder of a 31-year-old resident doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Aug 9 last year.

Our security forces achieved major success towards building a Naxal-free Bharat...”A senior IPS officer told TOI that Chalapati’s elimination, apart from reducing the strength of CPI (Maoist) central committee, will further erode the “ideological base” of the outfit comprising older, committed and educated cadres hailing from Andhra Pradesh.While the CPI (Maoist) politburo has shrunk with the arrest of members Prashant Bose alias Kishan Da in 2021 and Pramod Mishra in 2023, and killing of Kattakam Sudarshan in 2023, the strength has been reduced to 17-18 members with the arrest/ killing/ death of members like Sheela Marandi, Kanchanda, Mithilesh Mehta, Milind Teltumbde, B G Krishnamurthy, Haribhushan and Akkiraju Haragopal and now, Chalapati.“Barrring a few leaders from Jharkhand, the politburo/ CCM members hail from Andhra Pradesh. As they bow out with age, CPI (Maoist)’s next line of leadership will essentially be gun-wielding fighters with low ideological affinity. This sets the stage for weakening of the Maoist movement, and sits well with the goal to end Naxalism by March 2026,” said an officer.","Ramchandra Reddy Pratap Reddy, also known as Chalapati, a key CPI (Maoist) ideologue and mentor to commander Madvi Hidma, has been killed. His elimination marks a significant milestone in weakening the CPI (maoist)'s leadership, reducing its ideological base.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117437756,imgsize-35560,width-400,resizemode-4/117437756.jpg"

Vivek Ramaswamy says 'we are all in', dismisses any rift with either Musk or Trump



As Vivek Ramaswamy is out of the Department of Government Efficiency, he is being called the first casualty of the MAGA internal war. A Politico report said Vivek Ramaswamy's 'holiday rant' on X against American culture hastened the decision as Elon Musk made it known that he wanted Ramaswamy out of DOGE. Ramaswamy's opinion on H-1B visa program which allows US companies to hire foreign workers is aligned with that of Elon Muska and Donald Trump, but his rant ""irked some Republicans in Trump's circle"".In his rant, Vivek Ramaswamy said companies prefer foreign-born and first-generation engineers over native Americans because American culture venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long. And then he went on bashing some famous American movies, and series and said that American culture celebrated prom queen over the math olympiad champ.The Politico report quoted a Republican strategist close to Trump advisers who said that Ramaswamy ""burned through the bridges and he finally burned Elon"". ""Everyone wants him out of Mar-a-Lago, out of DC.""""They wanted him out before the tweet -- but kicked him to the curb when that (the X post) came out,"" one said.Another person told Politico that Elon Musk did not think it was feasible for Ramaswamy to campaign for office while working on DOGE.""It was my honor to help support the creation of DOGE.

The fire started in the hotel's restaurant and quickly spread, with delayed firefighting efforts and a failed fire detection system exacerbating the tragedy. An investigation is underway.

At least 76 people were killed and 51 injured on Tuesday in a fire at the Grand Kartal Hotel, a popular ski resort in northwestern Turkey, interior minister Ali Yerlikaya confirmed. The incident took place in Kartalkaya, Bolu province, during the school semester break when the resort was crowded with visitors.The fire, which started around 3:30 am in the hotel's restaurant, quickly spread through the 12-story building. Officials have launched an investigation into the cause of the blaze. The hotel, hosting 234 guests, was engulfed in smoke, making it difficult for many to escape.Two victims reportedly jumped from the building in panic, while others attempted to climb down using sheets and blankets, said Bolu Governor Abdulaziz Aydin. “People on the upper floors were screaming. They hung down sheets ... some tried to jump,” said Atakan Yelkovan, a guest at the hotel. He also noted the delayed arrival of firefighters, which took about an hour.Reports suggest the hotel's fire detection system failed to operate, with some guests alerted only by the smell of smoke. ""My wife smelled the burning. The alarm did not go off,” Yelkovan told IHA news agency.Ski instructor Necmi Kepcetutan described the chaotic scene, saying he helped around 20 guests escape. “I cannot reach some of my students. I hope they are OK,” he told NTV television.The hotel's chalet-style wooden cladding may have accelerated the fire's spread, according to NTV. The cliffside location of the 161-room hotel further complicated firefighting efforts. Television footage showed extensive damage, with the roof and upper floors consumed by flames and the lobby severely charred.Authorities have assigned six prosecutors to investigate the fire, and other nearby hotels were evacuated as a precaution. Guests were relocated to accommodations across Bolu province.In a separate incident on Tuesday, a gas explosion at a ski resort in central Turkey’s Sivas province injured four people, including skiers and instructors. The explosion occurred at the Yildiz Mountain Winter Sports Center, leaving one instructor with second-degree burns, the Sivas governor’s office confirmed.Kartalkaya, located in the Koroglu mountains about 300 kilometres east of Istanbul, is a popular winter destination, making the tragedy even more devastating during the peak holiday season.","At least 76 people were killed and 51 injured in a fire at the Grand Kartal Hotel.

Where is Michelle Obama?

Amid speculations over the marital status of Barack Obama and Michelle Obama as Michelle refuses to appear alongside Barack Obama at back-to-back protocol-breaking events, rumors that actor Jennifer Aniston has been dating Barack Obama resurfaced on social media. This link-up is not new as a magazine did a cover story on this rumored affair titled: 'The Truth About Jen & Barack!'.On the Jimmy Kimmel Show in October, Jennifer Aniston was asked about the cover story and Aniston strongly denied the claims. ""Of all the calls you get from your publicist where you're just like 'Oh, no, what's it gonna be?' or you get an email saying some cheesy tabloid is gonna make up a story - and then it's that…"" Aniston said adding that she was not mad about the cover story though it was absolutely untrue.""I've met him [Obama] once. I know Michelle more than him,"" Jennifer Aniston said. ""Is there a truth about you and Michelle?"" Jimmy Kimmel asked. ""That is not true,"" Jen said.According to reports, Jennifer Aniston met Barack Obama first and the only time in 2007 -- at a star-studded Hollywood gala.A Radaronline report said Barack and Michell were ""just friends"" amid their ""crumbling marriage after the couple were hit by the wild Jenifer Aniston affair rumors"". They have been living increasingly separate lives in recent years, the report said adding that Michelle was let down by the Jennifer Aniston rumors.""The Obamas are having a tough time, there's no doubt about that. Their once solid marriage has come under strain and for the first time, they're struggling to keep a lid on their problems. The Aniston 'affair' attention was unwanted and Michelle felt let down by it all. But the reality is they are more like friends at the moment, the spark has gone and they're simply going through the motions,"" Radar Online reported citing insiders.Amid the speculations, Barack Obama posted a heartfelt birthday wish for Michelle calling her the ""love of my life"". ""Happy birthday to the love of my life, @MichelleObama. You fill every room with warmth, wisdom, humour and grace -- and you look good going it.

Her office confirmed that there was a scheduling clash and she was on an extended vacation in Hawaii. Then it was informed that she would not attend Donald Trump's inauguration.

For example, Americans refer to the river forming the border between Texas and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas as the Rio Grande, while Mexicans call it the Rio Bravo.Such naming discrepancies have historically fueled diplomatic tensions between neighboring nations.

Poll Does Visible Policing in Neighborhoods Reduce Crime? No, It Doesn't Address Root Causes of Crime Yes, It Acts as a Strong Deterrent

Mumbai: After a 72-hour-long manhunt during which suspects were picked up from places as far apart as Mumbai, Virar, Thane and Durg, police finally found the man who stabbed actor Saif Ali Khan early Sunday. He was hiding in a marshy area dotted with vegetation on the edge of Thane city.A 150-member team of Mumbai and Thane police had narrowed down the search on the basis of CCTV footage and a tip-off to Kavesar near Ghodbunder Road. Carrying out a combing operation over shrubland and nullahs through the night, the team found the accused, a Bangladeshi illegal identified as Shariful Islam Shehzad Mohammed Rohilla Amin Fakir, 30, when a policeman shone a torch in a bushy area. Shariful had covered himself with dry leaves to stay concealed.Police had tracked his movements from Bandra to Worli and Thane by trawling through 500 CCTV recordings. Sources said they got a tip-off on Friday from the owner of a manpower supply agency. Jitendra Pandey had provided a housekeeping job to the accused in a restaurant at Worli and later in Thane without verifying his antecedents. Pandey is now being questioned.Shariful had used a fake name, Bijoy Das, to land the job in June 2024. In August, he was sacked from Worli's Slink and Bardot restaurant for theft. Police said Pandey redeployed him in Thane till Dec 15 when the establishment ended its contract with the staffing agency. Out of work, he began carrying out recces for burglary.Police have found a birth certificate, nationality card, and family contact details stored on his phone. Shariful, police said, has confessed to the crime. He planned to burgle a flat in Bandra or Khar as he knew the rich and famous lived in this area. He had no clue that he had entered actor Saif Ali Khan’s house.On Sunday afternoon, he was produced in the Bandra Magistrate’s court, where he was remanded to police custody for five days. Joint Commissioner of Police (Law & Order) Satyanarayan Chaudhari said police have invoked the Foreigners' Act, 1946, and Foreigners' Order, 1948 for illegal entry, alongside Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita sections for armed robbery against Shariful.A police team scanning CCTV footage looked at visuals from nearly 500 cameras to track the accused. One of the clearest markers in identifying the suspect across locations was the colour and pattern of his shoes.A team led by DCP Dikshit Gedam went through footage from cameras starting from the actor's building going towards Linking Road and Bandra station , then Dadar and Worli before tracking him to Thane.Other members of the team included ACP Adhikrao Pol, Senior Inspector Sanjay Marathe, Inspectors Sachin Rane and Ajay Lingnurkar, Assistant Inspectors Vijay Achrekar, Bajrang Jagtap, Tushar Sawant and staff.After escaping from the actor's flat, Shariful loitered around in the Bandra and Khar locality for almost five-and-half hours before catching a train from Bandra station to Dadar. By then, he had had a haircut, had a bath and changed his clothes.""When we started scanning through CCTVs, we spotted the accused near Sadhu Vasvani petrol pump on Linking Road in Bandra West where he had changed his shirt. As he knew there were cameras ahead, he crossed the road. But he was captured on cameras at a Khar hotel. After walking for almost an hour-and-half, he slept at Khar station at 4 am before returning to Bandra in the morning and taking a train at 8 am to Dadar,"" said a police officer.""We kept watching the leg and shoe for three hours and finally found the person in CCTV footage near National College. It resembled CCTV images captured at the actor's building. Then we spotted him in camera footage at Bandra railway station and then outside Dadar where he purchased some mobile phone accessories before he boarded a bus to Worli on Jan 16. He walked till he reached Worli Koliwada and stayed in a room where the pub hired by Pandey stayed. ""On Jan 17, in the afternoon, he left Worli and reached Thane and hid in a labour camp before he was arrested,"" said the officer.""He had illegally entered the country before reaching Mumbai. He was in Mumbai and Thane for the past six months and has used different names. We are collecting details about the documents he had created. He moved to Thane a few months ago. He returned to Mumbai 15 days ago before executive the offence. He was working with a housekeeping agency in Thane before he committed the offence and was caught within 72 hours,"" DCP Gedam said.""He was in urgent need of money and planned to rob anyone and immediately escape to Bangladesh,"" said another officer.During the search at Thane, the police team had almost given up hope after combing the area on the city's outskirts through the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday.By 2 am, they had scanned 30 to 40 acres of land, comprising a nullah and thorny bushes. The seniors kept egging their juniors on. Finally, the breakthrough came when one of them shone a torch on some bushes and found the accused lying there.","Bangladeshi illegal identified as Shariful Islam Shehzad Mohammed Rohilla Amin Fakir, 30. Police had tracked his movements from Bandra to Worli and Thane by trawling through 500 CCTV recordings. Shariful, police said, has confessed to the crime. He planned to burgle a flat in Bandra as he knew the rich and famous lived in this area.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117381779,imgsize-23588,width-400,resizemode-4/117381779.jpg"
Pardons to January 6 rioters divides Republicans to defend Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pardons-to-january-6-rioters-divides-republicans-to-defend-donald-trump/articleshow/117441145.cms,"President Trump signs executive order pardoning about 1,500 defendants charged in Jan 6 attack on US Capitol (AP photo)

Republican senators struggled to defend President Donald Trump 's decision to commute and pardon hundreds of January 6 protesters, including those charged and convicted of crimes against police officers, just hours after he took office on Monday.The move put Republicans in the awkward position of having to either defy Trump or defend releasing prisoners who attacked the very officers who protect the Capitol.Sen. Thom Tillis, R-NC, who previously warned against giving a blanket pardon to the rioters, said, ""I just can't agree"" with Trump's decision, adding that it ""raises a legitimate safety issues on Capitol Hill."" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., sidestepped questions about the pardons, saying, ""We're looking at the future, not the past,"" as reported by CNN.Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said he was still digesting the ""details"" of the pardons and commutations but emphasized that attacking a police officer is a ""very serious issue"" that should be punished. ""I think we need to continue to say we are a party of law and order,"" Lankford said.Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Bill Cassidy, R-La., Republicans who voted to convict Trump after his second impeachment trial in 2021, also objected to his decision. Murkowski expressed concern about the message the pardons send to the US Capitol Police officers who protect lawmakers every day, while Cassidy stated, ""I'm a big 'back-the-blue' guy. I think people who assault police officers — if they do the crime, they should do the time.""When asked Tuesday whether he believed it was never acceptable to assault a police officer, Trump replied, ""Sure."" Pressed on a specific case of an individual who drove a stun gun into the neck of a police officer but received a pardon, Trump said he didn't know but would ""take a look at everything."" He also claimed to be ""the friend of police more than any president that's ever been in this office.""Even Vice President JD Vance said few days before taking office that those who committed violence on January 6 ""obviously"" shouldn't be pardoned. When asked why Vance's assertion was wrong, Trump said, ""Well, only for one reason: They've served years in jail. They should not have served — excuse me — and they've served years in jail. … These were people that actually love our country, so we thought a pardon would be appropriate.""Most Republicans wouldn't weigh in on whether Trump had made the right decision, arguing that it was the president's prerogative, not Congress', to issue pardons. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., echoed this sentiment, with Johnson stating, ""It's not my place. It's the president's sole decision, and he made a decision so I stand with him on it.""When repeatedly asked about the pardons for individuals who attacked officers, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., largely redirected the discussion to Biden's pardons, even as he agreed that January 6 was ""no question"" a ""riot."" He said, ""I have my personal feelings on it, but the American people have chosen to move on, and President Trump, it's his prerogative to do this. … I get what you're saying about the violent crime; however, that is still the president's prerogative, just like it was Joe Biden's prerogative.""Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., would only say, ""I'm grateful President Trump is the president of the United States"" when asked for his reaction to the pardons.The controversy is centred around US President Trump granting clemency to over 1,500 participants of the January 6 Capitol incident, encompassing leaders of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers organisations on his Day 1 in office. The presidential pardons cover individuals found guilty of grave offences, notwithstanding resistance and documented proof of aggressive encounters.The extended siege, lasting seven hours, caused injuries to more than 140 law enforcement personnel and resulted in the loss of life for four Trump supporters and five police officers, through both immediate and subsequent circumstances. The ensuing probe by the FBI and Justice Department evolved into the most extensive criminal investigation ever conducted in US history, with charges filed against more than 1,580 persons and successfully securing roughly 1,270 guilty verdicts.","Republican senators struggled to defend President Donald Trump's decision to commute and pardon hundreds of January 6 protesters, including those charged and convicted of crimes against police officers.

Trump Inauguration: Why Melania Trump had her face hidden by a hat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-inauguration-why-melania-trump-had-her-face-hidden-by-a-hat/articleshow/117427701.cms,"First lady Melania Trump stands for a benediction during the 60th Presidential Inauguration in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Monday, Jan. 20, 2025.

Melania's hat stops Donald Trump kissing her at inauguration ceremony

The millinery, more than any other element of Melania Trump ’s inauguration ensemble, captured attention and sparked conversation. The wide-brim navy hat obscured much of her face, giving her an aura of inaccessibility and mystery. As Professor Nichola Gutgold, author of Electing Madam Vice President: When Women Run, Women Win, remarked in an email to CNN, “(With) her face half hidden by her hat, Melania remains aloof.” This air of detachment, coupled with the ensemble’s structured elements, conveyed a subtle defensiveness and a slight combative edge—an aesthetic that has become emblematic of Trump’s style evolution.During her first term as first lady, from 2017 to 2021, Melania Trump’s fashion choices gradually transitioned toward a more armored and strategic style. Initially soft and nostalgic—recall her Jackie Kennedy-inspired baby-blue Ralph Lauren ensemble at her first inauguration—her wardrobe evolved into one characterized by structured silhouettes and military-inspired detailing. Khaki dresses, sharply tailored navy suits, and outfits in muted grays became staples. These choices featured cinched waists, hard shoulders, and longer hemlines, evoking an image of restraint, power, and control.This shift was no accident. According to Kate Bennett, a former CNN White House correspondent and author of Free, Melania: The Unauthorized Biography, Trump’s clothing choices mirrored her guarded public persona . “Her silhouettes became long-sleeved, cinched waists, hard shoulders, longer hemlines, like almost a military-esque vibe,” Bennett noted. “I think that’s because it felt like armor … because she underwent four years of really intense scrutiny.”The scrutiny was indeed unparalleled. As the spouse of one of the most polarizing political figures in modern history, Melania Trump often found herself the subject of public and media examination, her every word, action, and outfit dissected. Unlike past first ladies who leaned into relatability or accessibility to counteract such pressures, Trump seemed to respond by retreating further into a private cocoon, using fashion as a literal and metaphorical barrier.Her hat at the 2025 inauguration epitomized this strategy. It recalled the other iconic broad-brimmed hat she wore during the state visit of French President Emmanuel Macron in 2018—a piece that also conveyed control and authority while maintaining an air of elegance. The choice of such millinery, both then and now, underscores her preference for styles that create boundaries between herself and the public.This intentional use of fashion as a form of armor aligns with the broader themes of her public life: elusive, impenetrable, and unwaveringly private. While her outfits may adhere to the highest standards of craftsmanship, they resist offering any real insight into her thoughts or emotions. Instead, they reinforce the idea that Melania Trump is a figure meant to be observed, not fully known—a paradoxical blend of visibility and concealment.By the time of her husband’s second inauguration, her style had cemented itself as a deliberate form of self-presentation. Each tailored coat, each structured dress, and each sweeping hat spoke volumes—not about who she is, but about the image she wished to project. Detached yet formidable, she continues to redefine the role of first lady, using sartorial choices to navigate public life on her own terms.","During her first term as first lady, from 2017 to 2021, Melania Trump’s fashion choices gradually transitioned toward a more armored and strategic style.

Watch: Trump pardons roughly 1,500 Jan. 6 rioters

President Donald Trump addressed his decision to pardon and commute sentences of approximately 1,500 defendants linked to the January 6 Capitol incident in 2021, including those convicted of assaulting law enforcement officers.As one of his initial presidential actions, he commuted 14 prisoners' sentences and pardoned all others convicted of offences related to the 2021 riot, by signing an executive order. He also instructed the attorney general to dismiss all pending indictments connected to this extensive federal investigation.""They've served years in jail,"" Trump said in response to questions from reporters at the White House about why he pardoned violent offenders. ""They should not have served, and they've served years in jail. And murderers don't even go to jail in this country.""""We pardoned people that were treated unbelievably poorly,"" he added.The pardons encompassed individuals convicted of violent attacks against police officers during the January 6, 2021 Capitol incident, when Congress was certifying Joe Biden 's electoral victory. These pardons extended to people who possessed weapons such as stun guns, batons and hatchets.Regarding the Oath Keepers, a far-right organisation, the President described their sentences as ""ridiculous and excessive"" and stated, ""these were people that actually love our country, so we thought a pardon would be appropriate."" Several Oath Keepers faced seditious conspiracy convictions related to January 6.The President also addressed various policy matters, including potential Russian sanctions, proposed tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China, and immigration policies. He discussed implementing 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada from February 1, citing concerns about illegal border crossings and narcotics trafficking.Meanwhile, regarding the H-1B visa programme, he expressed a balanced view, acknowledging both perspectives on skilled worker immigration.

Trump's Savage 'Eyeroll' After 'Woke' LGBTQ+ Plea By Washington Cathedral Bishop | Watch

Donald Trump SLAMS sermon, after Bishop pleads for immigrants, transgender rights

During President Donald Trump 's inaugural prayer service on Tuesday, Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde , leader of the Episcopal diocese of Washington , made a direct plea to the president to ""have mercy"" on gay, lesbian, transgender children, as well as immigrants in the country. This appeal came just a day after Trump issued several executive orders focused on transgender rights and immigration.""I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now,"" Budde said. ""There are gay, lesbian and transgender children in Democratic, Republican and independent families, some who fear for their lives.""Budde also addressed Trump's promise to enact mass deportations and turn away refugees and asylum-seekers, saying, ""I ask you to have mercy, Mr. President, on those in our communities whose children fear that their parents will be taken away and that you help those who are fleeing war zones and persecution in their own lands to find compassion and welcome here.""Trump, seated in the front pew, occasionally looked down, while Vice President JD Vance glanced at his wife before seemingly raising his eyebrows in surprise.Meanwhile, when asked by a reporter later what he thought of the service, Trump responded, ""Did you like it? Did you find it exciting? Not too exciting was it? I didn't think it was a good service, no. They could do much better.""The direct appeal to Trump at the start of his first full day as president was a remarkable moment at an event that has not historically been political, according to many. They saw Budde's candid sermon as a sign of the alarm in Washington and beyond over his immigration agenda and blitz of executive actions focused on gender identity. Budde was flooded with messages of support from people hailing her ""courage"". ""Wow. A bishop just called out Trump and Vance to their faces at church,"" said a podcast cast host on X. A man with Democrat in his also praised the bishop and said, ""HAHAHA! Trump is FURIOUS after being called out by Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde,"" adding, "" Trump’s fragile ego has been badly damaged!""Meanwhile, Rep Mike Collins was irked by the sermon and said, ""The person giving this sermon should be added to the deportation list."" Other people also jumped on social media to oppose the bishop's action. ""The bishop embarrassed herself and it made Trump look like a leader,"" said an attorney and radio broadcaster according to his X profile.In an interview, Budde explained that she decided to speak to him directly because ""of the fear that I have seen and experienced among our people -- people that I know and love, both within the immigrant community and within the LGBTQ community, and how terrified so many are.""Bishop Budde, aged 65, holds the distinction of being the first female spiritual leader of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, a position she has maintained since 2011.Prior to her Washington appointment, she served as rector at St. John's Episcopal Church in Minneapolis for close to twenty years. She completed her education at the University of Rochester in upstate New York, and spent her formative years between New Jersey and Colorado. The diocese under her leadership, encompassing the National Cathedral, had arranged for a prayer service to be held the day following the inauguration, irrespective of the election results. She confirmed her commitment to deliver the sermon, regardless of who emerged victorious.","Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde urged President Trump to show compassion towards gay, lesbian, transgender children, and immigrants.

Attorneys general from 18 Democratic-led states sued President Trump on Tuesday to block an executive order that refuses to recognise the US-born children of unauthorised immigrants as citizens, the opening salvo in what promises to be a long legal battle over the Trump administration’s immigration policies.The complaint, filed in federal district court in Massachusetts was joined by the cities of San Francisco and Washington, DC. The states view Trump’s attempt to limit birthright citizenship as “extraordinary and extreme,” said New Jersey attorney general Matthew Platkin, who led the legal effort along with the attorneys general from California and Massachusetts. “Presidents are powerful, but he is not a king. He cannot rewrite the constitution with a stroke of the pen.”The lawsuit followed a pair of similar cases filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, immigrant organisations and an expectant mother in the hours after Trump signed the executive order.The White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment.","Attorneys general from 18 Democratic-led states sued President Trump on Tuesday to block an executive order that refuses to recognise the US-born children of unauthorised immigrants as citizens.

It was not easy for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to hide their feelings as thousands of cameras flashed on them as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States after a bitterly fought election. Donald Trump had to fight both of them as Joe Biden was initially the presidential candidate until he was forced t0 bow out in favor of Kamala Harris.

Biden appeared lost in space,"" the expert said adding that Kamala Harris displayed visible signs of deep emotion throughout the inauguration. She took a deep breath and looked tense.Body language expert Blanca Cobb noted that during Donald Trump's inauguration speech, Biden and Harris did not clap. ""Their body language spoke volumes: Harris maintained a sharp, unwavering stare, her arms crossed on her lap, a posture that conveyed disapproval and restrained tension. Meanwhile, Biden's subtle smirk added a layer of quiet disagreement,"" he said.According to a lip reader, Barack Obama asked George W Bush how they could ""stop what's happening"" during the inauguration.

ISLAMABAD: The first commercial flight landed at Pakistan’s new Gwadar International Airport on Monday following a months-long delay in the opening of the Beijing-funded facility in volatile Balochistan province.The airport’s opening was postponed from Aug 14 to the end of 2024 due to a security review sparked by a series of deadly attacks by separatist militants in Balochistan, in Pakistan’s southwest. Then, on Jan 10, the airport was due to open, but this was again delayed.“The $246-million Chinese-backed project is expected to grow into one of Pakistan’s biggest airports and serve both domestic and international travel,” the Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA) said in a statement.“Pakistan achieved a landmark moment in its aviation history on Monday as the first commercial flight successfully landed at the new Gwadar International Airport,” the statement read, adding the new airport is poised to play a pivotal role in connecting Pakistan to global markets and facilitating trade, tourism, and economic development.PIA Flight PK-503 departed from Karachi at 9.50 am and touched down at the airport at 11.15 am, carrying 46 passengers. In a video shared by PAA, the PIA flight was seen being greeted by a traditional water salute by water bowsers as it landed.China has pledged more than $65 billion for infrastructure, energy, and other projects in Pakistan under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ). As part of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Pakistan is also creating a deep-water port near the new Gwadar airport, a joint venture between Pakistan, Oman, and China that is nearing completion. Chinese people and projects have been frequently attacked in the past by separatists who view Beijing as a foreign invader trying to gain control of impoverished but mineral-rich Balochistan, the site of a decades-long insurgency.Recent attacks, including one in Oct 2024 in which two Chinese workers were killed in a suicide bombing in Karachi, have forced Beijing to publicly criticise Pakistan for security lapses. In recent months, the media has widely reported that China wants its own security forces on the ground to protect its nationals and projects, a demand Islamabad has long resisted.","PIA Flight PK-503 departed from Karachi at 9.50 am and touched down at the airport at 11.15 am, carrying 46 passengers.

Pak authorities demolish pre-Partition Ahmadi worship place,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-authorities-demolish-pre-partition-ahmadi-worship-place/articleshow/117361970.cms,"File photo

ISLAMABAD: A pre-Partition place of worship of the minority Ahmadi community was completely demolished by the local administration in Punjab’s Sialkot district, Pakistani media reported on Saturday.The place was built by Chaudhry Zafarullah Khan , Pakistan’s first foreign minister and an Ahmadi by faith, in his native town of Daska, Sialkot. A renowned lawyer in British India, he was a crucial champion for the Ahmadi cause in significant trials.This historical structure was razed on Jan 16, two days after local authorities claimed that an extension of the structure was illegal as it encroached 13 feet onto a public road, a claim rejected by community members.Despite this, Amir Mahmood, spokesperson for the marginalised community, said they had complied with the govt notice and a wall was constructed on the inner side on Jan 15, but the area’s assistant commissioner, accompanied by police, proceeded with the demolition the next day and flattened the entire structure. “It is clear that using the illegal encroachments as an excuse, the administration targeted and demolished the Ahmadi community’s place of worship,” Mahmood said, adding the structure had not been altered or extended since its original construction by Khan’s family before Partition. He blamed the local administration for continuously targeting the community’s properties and ignoring their grievances.The operation lasted from 7pm until 11pm, and electricity to the place of worship and neighbouring areas was also cut off. The action was not strictly administrative as during the entire time, locals said, a number of people had gathered chanting provocative slogans against the persecuted community. This was the latest in a series of actions targeting Ahmadis. According to data, at least 22 of their places of worship were destroyed across Punjab in 2024.","A pre-Partition place of worship of the minority Ahmadi community was completely demolished by the local administration in Punjab.

"Imran, wife sentenced to jail in corruption case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-wife-sentenced-to-jail-in-corruption-case/articleshow/117340821.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Jailed Pakistani former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi , were sentenced to 14-year and seven-year jail terms, respectively, after an accountability court found the couple guilty of corruption by receiving land as a bribe from a Pakistani real-estate czar.The makeshift court operating from Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, where Khan has been incarcerated since Aug 2023, had reserved its verdict three times in the £190-million (about Rs 2,003 crore in Indian currency) Al-Qadir Trust case since Dec last year. Following the ruling, Bushra was arrested from the courtroom.Accountability court judge Nasir Javed Rana also fined Khan Pakistani Rs 1 million ($3,500), while Bibi was fined half that amount.Failure to pay the fines would result in an additional six months in jail for Imran and three months for Bushra, the judge said.According to the verdict, the property of the “sham trust Al-Qadir University Project Trust is hereby forfeited to the federal govt”.“Both convicts are present before the court; they be taken into custody in this case and be handed over to the jail superintendent along with the committal warrant to serve the sentences so awarded,” it added.The couple were indicted in the case on Feb 27, 2024, shortly after the general elections.The case alleges that Khan and his wife had acquired land worth billions of rupees (millions of US dollars) for the Al-Qadir Trust from Malik Riaz Hussain, a prominent property tycoon in Pakistan, to establish a nonprofit educational institute for the poor. In return, Pakistan’s anti-corruption watchdog alleged, Khan’s govt from Aug 2018 to April 2022 had provided legal cover to Riaz’s black money (£130 million), which Britain’s National Crime Agency had recovered and handed over to the Pakistan govt.This has been the fourth major case in which the former cricket star has been convicted. Last year, Khan was convicted in cases related to selling state gifts, leaking state secrets, and unlawful marriage, all of which were later overturned or suspended by the Islamabad high court. Despite this, Khan remains behind bars, with dozens of cases pending against him. He describes the cases as a political witch-hunt.Khan was first arrested in connection with the Al-Qadir Trust case on May 9, 2023, spending just two days in detention. However, the arrest had sparked nationwide protests during which Khan’s supporters had stormed govt buildings and military installations in multiple cities.Speaking to reporters inside the courtroom after his conviction, Imran rejected the notion of striking a deal with anyone to get himself freed from prison. “I will neither make any deal nor seek any relief,” he told reporters, adding that those who stand against dictatorship are punished.His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI)condemned the conviction as a continuation of “bogus persecution” against Khan and his wife. “While the party awaits the detailed decision, it is important to note that the Al Qadir Trust case against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi lacks any solid foundation and is bound to collapse,” the PTI said. “All evidence and witness testimonies confirm that there has been no mismanagement or wrongdoing. Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi are merely trustees, with no further involvement in the matter,” it added.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 14-year and seven-year jail terms, respectively.

Pakistan International Airlines: PIA apologises for controversial ad featuring Eiffel Tower after brutal trolling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pia-apologises-for-controversial-ad-featuring-eiffel-tower-after-brutal-trolling/articleshow/117332061.cms,"Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has issued an apology after an advert featuring a plane flying toward the Eiffel Tower sparked outrage online.The image, posted on the airline’s official X account, was intended to mark the first flight to Paris since safety restrictions were lifted, but it quickly drew criticism for its perceived insensitivity.“Unfortunately, this was blown out of proportion, with connotations and perceptions that were not intended,” PIA spokesman Abdullah Khan told AFP. “It may have triggered some negative emotions, for which we sincerely apologise,” he added.The post showed a PIA aircraft heading directly toward the famous French landmark, with the caption “Paris, we are coming today.” Many users on social media compared the visual to the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US, where hijacked planes crashed into the Twin Towers in New York, killing nearly 3,000 people.Thousands of comments pointed out the similarities between the advert and the 2001 attacks, where two planes were flown into the World Trade Center. Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan by US forces in 2011, and a Pakistani militant, currently detained in Guantanamo Bay, is believed to have been the chief mastermind of those attacks.Critics were quick to voice their concerns online. One user asked, “Is this an advertisement or a threat?” while another wrote, “I’d have a word with your marketing department on this one, chief.” Other users also joked, “Paris must be on high alert by now,” and “I would rate this art 9 out of 11.”Khan added that the negative reactions amounted to around 60,000 to 70,000 comments.Finance minister Ishaq Dar said that the prime minister has ordered an inquiry into the advert, calling it an example of “stupidity.”PIA’s reputation has faced multiple setbacks in recent years. In June 2020, the airline was banned from flying to the European Union, UK, and US after one of its Airbus A-320 planes crashed in Karachi, killing nearly 100 people. The disaster was blamed on human error by the pilots and air traffic control, and it was later revealed that a significant number of pilots had dubious or fake licences.In 2016, a PIA plane caught fire after one of its engines failed during a flight from the remote north to Islamabad, killing over 40 people.In November, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency lifted the ban on PIA, citing “sufficient confidence” in the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority’s oversight. However, the airline remains barred from flying in the UK and the US.PIA continues to fly to multiple cities across Pakistan, including in the mountainous north, and also serves destinations in the Gulf and Southeast Asia.Despite the backlash, Khan noted that the airline’s return to Europe has been welcomed with positive feedback. Flights to Paris have been operating at over 95% capacity.The controversial post is still live on PIA's official X handle.",Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has issued an apology after an advert featuring a plane flying toward the Eiffel Tower sparked outrage online.

Meanwhile, Pakistan opposition leader said that they will challenge the order.The allegations centre on the acceptance of land from a property magnate in return for facilitating money laundering during Khan's tenure as Prime Minister.The prosecution contends that the businessman, Malik Riaz, received permission from Khan to settle penalties in a separate case using the same laundered funds, amounting to 190 million British pounds ($240 million), which British authorities had returned to Pakistan's national treasury in 2022.Since his arrest in 2023, Khan has consistently maintained his innocence, asserting that the charges are fabricated by his opponents to prevent his political comeback.Prior to this verdict, Khan had received three separate convictions: corruption, disclosure of state secrets, and marriage law violations, resulting in sentences of 10, 14 and seven years respectively.
