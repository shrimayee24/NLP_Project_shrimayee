What led to clashes?



'Attack on India's democracy, rule of law': BJP condemns violent protests



'Well-planned conspiracy by UP CM Adityanath, BJP-RSS'



NEW DELHI: At least 3 people were dead and several others, including over 20 police personnel, were injured in Uttar Pradesh 's Sambhal after violent clashes erupted following a court-mandated survey of the Mughal-era Jama Masjid.The survey was ordered following a petition filed by senior advocate Vishnu Shanker Jain , claiming that the mosque was originally a temple.Sambhal district Magistrate issued a notification prohibiting any outsider, social oraganisation or public representative from entering the riot-torn district without the orders of the authorities.""The order number 942 / Judicial Assistant / Section-163 / 2024 dated 01.10.2024 issued by the undersigned has imposed a prohibitory order under Section 163 of the Indian Citizens Security Code, 2023 in district Sambhal, effective until November 30,"" the circular said.""No external person, other social organizations, or public representatives will be allowed to enter the district of Sambhal without permission from the competent authority. This order will be an integral part of the prohibitory order dated 01.10.2024 and will be enforced immediately. Violation of this order will be a punishable offense under Section 223 of the Indian Penal Code, 2023,"" it added.As a precaution, internet services across the district have been suspended for a day.In view of the violence, the district administration issued a notice prohibiting citizens from buying or collecting stones, soda bottles, or any flammable or explosive materials on their roofs. The notice, issued by local SDM, warns that strict action will be taken against anyone found violating this order. Additionally, instructions were given to the Municipal Corporation to confiscate any construction material lying on roads immediately.Around 20 people have been taken into custody following the alleged stone-pelting and clashes that erupted during a survey of a mosque in Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal on Sunday morning, police said.The tension started on Sunday morning as a large group of people gathered near the mosque and started shouting slogans as the survey team began their work in the Shahi Jama Masjid.The protesters tried to torch vehicles and pelted stones at the police who used tear gas and batons to disperse the mob.""Gunshots were fired by the miscreants and some pellets struck our policemen. We are investigating where the shots were fired from, particularly in the Deepa Sarai area,"" an officer said.Tension has been brewing in Sambhal over the past few days after the Jama Masjid was surveyed last Tuesday on the orders of a local court following a petition that claimed that a Harihar temple stood at the site.""Some miscreants in the crowd threw stones at the police team. The police used minor force and tear gas to bring the situation under control,"" Superintendent of Police Krishna Kumar Vishnoi said.""We are in the process of registering an FIR in the incident. The accused will also be booked under the NSA,"" the police officer added.Petitioner Vishnu Shankar Jain had said the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division) ordered the constitution of an ""Advocate Commission"" to survey the mosque. The court has said that a report should be filed after conducting a videography and photography survey through the commission, he had said.The Central and Uttar Pradesh governments, the mosque committee and the district magistrate of Sambhal have been made parties in the petition concerning the mosque, Jain.Uttar Pradesh minister Yogendra Upadhyay condemned the stone pelting at an ASI team surveying a Mughal-era mosque in Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal and asserted that everyone has to live according to law and order under UP CM Yogi Adityanath 's governance.""I condemn this action. It is reprehensible to disobey the order given by the court. Failure to follow the court's order is a big crime... Under Yogi Adityanath's rule, everyone has to live according to law and order, despite their class or status in society,"" Upadhyay said.Union minister Giriraj Singh reacted to the stone pelting incident on the survey team and said that it was not just an assault on the government but an attack on India's democracy and rule of law.Singh criticised the community responsible for the attack, accusing them of showing distrust in the country's democratic institutions and emphasized that the nation will not tolerate such actions.""The attack that was carried out by a community in Sambhal and that too on the government machinery, this attack is not on the government machinery but on the democracy and law of India on which they do not trust. Now the country will not tolerate how this attack was carried out,"" Singh said,Meanwhile, Congress alleged that the Yogi Adityanath administration is squarely responsible for killing innocents and only the BJP-RSS is guilty of ""setting fire"" to the peace and harmony there.The opposition party said the videos of direct firing on the protesters in Sambhal depict the horrifying result of a ""well-planned conspiracy"" by Adityanath and the BJP-RSS.""In this entire matter, the BJP neither wanted the survey to proceed nor to stop it; its sole objective was to destroy harmony,"" Khera said.""No citizen in Uttar Pradesh is 'safe' under CM Adityanath, who gave the reprehensible slogan of 'Batenge toh Katenge'. This is evident by the highly deplorable incidents of Sambhal today,"" he added.Western Uttar Pradesh, which has been a symbol of goodwill and harmony for years, has today witnessed three people killed and many injured under a ""well-planned conspiracy"", the Congress leader said.""We say with full responsibility that the Adityanath administration is squarely responsible for killing innocents and only the BJP-RSS is guilty of setting fire to the peace and harmony of Sambhal. Modi-Yogi 'double assault' governments, which consider the minority community as second-class citizens, hurriedly got a petition filed in court,"" Khera said.It is public knowledge that the court ordered an immediate survey without hearing the other side, he said.""No action was taken against the rioters who accompanied the survey team. This makes it clear that after the by-elections in the state, the Yogi government has further intensified the politics of violence and hatred,"" he added.Khera said Rahul Gandhi has been continuously and stridently talked about 'Nafrat Ke Bazaar Mein Mohabbat Ki Dukaan' and in such a situation, an appeal is made to the people of Sambhal to recognise the politics of hatred, maintain mutual unity, amity and harmony, and take steps to protect their rights in a legal manner.","At least 3 dead and over 20 police personnel injured in Sambhal, Uttar Pradesh.

Maharashtra election results: Momentum builds in BJP to make Devendra Fadnavis CM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-election-results-momentum-builds-in-bjp-to-make-devendra-fadnavis-cm/articleshow/115636595.cms,"Also read:

MUMBAI: The 'Devendra Fadnavis or Eknath Shinde ' conundrum continues for Mahayuti on the question of who should be the new CM even as there are indications that BJP would not want to delay the return of Devendra Fadnavis to Varsha, the CM's official residence in Mumbai.Shinde would have been a shoo-in as CM had the poll results thrown up a modest majority for Mahayuti, but the scale of BJP's performance has transformed the party's outlook.It would like to leverage the numbers it has to anoint Fadnavis as CM as it believes he scripted the big win after playing second fiddle to Shinde for 2.5 years as dy CM.Though this will not please the Shinde-led Sena as the poll campaign was carried out under his leadership, BJP's brass is reportedly pushing for a change. It acknowledges Shinde's leadership, the success of his Ladki Bahin initiative and his persona as a man of action, but it believes the win has equally been that of Hindutva forces best articulated during campaigns by PM Modi, Amit Shah and Yogi Adityanath Ajit Pawar 's NCP too is in favour of Fadnavis taking over as CM, sources said. They said RSS has its own view, pushing subtly for Fadnavis.Eknath Shinde is learnt to be reluctant to leave the CM office. Sources suggest Shinde's reluctance to step down is rooted in a strategic argument by him. He believes his continuation would be beneficial for Mahayuti alliance in the upcoming local body elections, including the crucial BMC elections.Shinde's argument is that his appeal among urban and Marathi voters could further consolidate the coalition's grip on state politics, ensuring a sweep in local polls. This perspective taps into the regional pride and grassroots connection that Shinde has cultivated, which could be advantageous for the party's broader political strategy.Sources said internal discussions within BJP circles are intense. On the one hand, the party recognises electoral advantage of having a neta like Shinde, who has proven his mettle in connecting with the populace. On the other, the leadership sees Fadnavis as a figure who can bring a fresh, dynamic approach to governance, realigning state politics with the national BJP narrative of development and efficiency.Party insiders say several rounds of meetings, including a top brass brainstorming until late Saturday night, took place, but the issue remained undecided. Sources added that the issue is unlikely to be resolved immediately.Fadnavis could not continue as CM in 2019 despite BJP and undivided Shiv Sena alliance's victory under his leadership, and later, he had to be content with deputy CM's office under Shinde.Fadnavis, known for his administrative acumen and political astuteness, has a history of steering Maharashtra through economic reforms and infrastructural developments. His tenure was marked by aggressive governance, which appealed to a segment of the voters who are now possibly looking for a return to his leadership style. However, the decision to replace Shinde is not straightforward.The incumbent Mahayuti alliance delivered a stunning performance in Maharashtra, winning 233 out of 288 seats and dealing a major blow to the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), reducing them to just 49 seats and leaving them unable to claim the post of opposition leader. The tenure of the current Maharashtra assembly ends on Tuesday.Meanwhile, all 57 Shiv Sena MLAs have been called to a hotel in Bandra to elect the legislature party leader. The meeting may take place on Monday. Sena functionaries said CM Shinde is likely to submit his resignation to the governor on Monday or Tuesday and then continue as caretaker CM till the new CM and cabinet take oath.","The incumbent Mahayuti alliance delivered a stunning performance in Maharashtra, winning 233 out of 288 seats and dealing a major blow to the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) The tenure of the current Maharashtra assembly ends on Tuesday.

Drawing comparison to Sudan, he pointed out that the characteristics of such states are visible in its population which ""are worried about who to shoot and where to capture.""""The characteristics of failed states are visible in the population here.For example... sometimes we think... why are people in Sudan fighting for 20 years in the civil war. Because when you are in that failed state, then people are not worried about how our children will study in Sudan. They are worried about who to shoot and where to capture. So that is the situation in Bihar too. And we must be aware of it,"" he said, addressing Bihari diaspora in US.""We have to realise that this (Bihar) is a state which is in deep shit. If Bihar were a country, it would be the 11th largest country in terms of population in the world. We have just overtaken Japan in terms of population,"" he added.The election strategist outlined key priorities for governance of his party, with a strong emphasis on improving school education. Kishor said that, if voted to power, his administration would prioritize educational reforms, with funding sourced from the revenue generated by lifting the statewide alcohol ban.Kishor's newly formed party, Jan Suraaj, suffered a significant setback in its debut election, failing to secure a single seat and unable to retain its deposits in three constituencies.The party's performance was disappointing, with the exception of Imamganj, where Jan Suraaj candidate Jitendra Paswan managed to secure over 22% of the vote. In the other three constituencies, however, the party struggled to make an impact, marking a difficult start for Kishor's political venture.","Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj party failed to secure a single seat in its debut election.

BAREILLY: Three people died and several others, including 20-odd police personnel, were injured when a court-mandated survey at the Mughal-era Jama Masjid in Sambhal spiralled into violent clashes on Sunday morning. Till last reports, three people, including a police officer injured in firing, were reported critical.Around a dozen people, including two women, have been detained.The survey was ordered following a petition filed by senior advocate Vishnu Shanker Jain, claiming that the mosque was originally a temple.The survey, conducted by an Archaeological Survey of India team under the supervision of court commissioner Ramesh Singh and in the presence of DM Rajendra Pensia, SP Krishan Kumar, and other officials, began at 7am and initially proceeded peacefully. Around 9am, a mob gathered outside the mosque, allegedly shouting slogans and pelting police personnel with stones.Divisional commissioner Aunjaneya Singh said, ""A crowd of 2,000-3,000 people gathered and threw stones at police personnel stationed for security. Despite initial efforts to disperse them with tear gas and lathi charges, the mob intensified its attack and started firing from nearby houses, leading to injuries among officers, including the SP's PRO, SDM Ramesh Babu, and circle officer Anuj Chaudhary, who was hit by bullet pellets."" Singh said the SDM sustained fractures and more than a dozen cops were injured. The mob also set several vehicles ablaze.The unrest later spread to Deep Sarai, where people allegedly threw stones at police from houses. ""Children aged 12-15 were used as shields, and many of the perpetrators were under 25. Several women were also involved,"" Singh said.Vehicles were torched, and additional forces were called in from neighbouring districts to contain the situation,"" Singh added. The survey team was safely evacuated from the area, and internet services were suspended in the district by Sunday evening.Those who died have been identified as Mohd Nayeem, Mohd Bilal, and Mohd Nauman, all residents of Sambhal. ""My brother was shot dead by circle officer Anuj Chaudhary. We saw him aiming at my brother. We demand strict action,"" Bilal's younger brother said.Singh dismissed the claims, saying, ""We have videographic evidence of the incident. If the family acknowledges their son was part of the mob, they should reflect on why he was throwing stones. Police responded to firing from both sides to ensure the safety of the survey team and restore order.""Concerns about potential damage to the mosque were also raised. Singh said, ""While stone pelting near the mosque may have caused some damage, it is unclear... The survey was conducted peacefully, and no changes were made to the mosque's structure.""SP Krishan Kumar Bishnoi said, ""The situation is under control now. Those responsible will face charges under National Security Act. We appeal to residents to avoid violence and trust the judicial process."" Singh added, ""We are reviewing videos of the incident to identify all those involved. The perpetrators' use of stones and bullets from three sides of the mosque after the survey team left led to the need for additional force.""A similar survey was conducted peacefully on Tuesday, with police and members of the mosque's management committee present.

Asked to surrender, main accused in murder of cop opened fire at police team at a close range

NEW DELHI: Less than 20 hours after constable Kiranpal Singh was stabbed to death in south Delhi's Govindpuri , Delhi Police tracked down key accused Rocky alias Raghav (19) to Sangam Vihar and gunned him down when ""he fired at cops"".Following Singh's brutal murder early Saturday, police had launched a massive manhunt to arrest the culprits. Rocky's accomplices, Deepak and Krish, were nabbed the same afternoon.Their interrogation on Sunday revealed Singh wasn't the lone target. Rocky, high on sedatives and alcohol, allegedly stabbed and robbed two others in a similar manner that night. Police are probing these separately.To catch Rocky, who was still on the loose, the police chief put the special cell's best men on the job. ""Around 9.30am, special commissioner R P Upadhyay tasked additional commissioner Pramod Kushwaha with the case,"" said a source. A veteran of anti-terror operations and organised crime gangs, Kushwaha assembled a special team.The special team comprised inspector Shiv Kumar, SI Adesh and head constables Arjun, Kaushinder, Balkar and Mohit, the source said. The team collected intelligence and activated informers in south Delhi. They also scouted the area from Surajkund road to Sangam Vihar while developing the leads. By late Saturday evening, the suspect was identified. Rocky’s identity was corroborated through his Instagram pro file, where he had uploaded a string of photographs and videos posing with guns. He operated two accounts on Instagram, each with about 200 followers.Just a day before the cop’s murder, he had uploaded a video titled “college me kaand” (scandal in college).In the following hour, Rocky was traced to a location in Sangam Vihar. “The police team told him to surrender. Not heeding them, the suspect opened fire at them from a close distance. He fired five times, one of which hit SI Adesh on his bulletproof vest,” said a senior cop.In defence, police fired at Rocky. “He was immediately rushed to ESIC Hospital in Okhla, where he passed away due to the injuries. A .32 bore pistol with two live rounds was recovered from the spot. No police official was injured in the defensive counter-fire,” the senior cop said, adding all protocols as laid down by law for instances of death in police action were being followed.Police have established the sequence of events that led to the cop’s murder. Constable Kiranpal Singh was last seen alive around 4.30am Saturday, along with fellow constables Banai Singh and Sunil, at a police booth near Arya Samaj temple in Govindpuri area. Constable Sunil went to deliver some documents at the police station but when he returned, Singh was missing.A search ensued, and Singh was found lying unconscious on the roadside, near the entrance of lane number 13 at Sant Ravidas Marg, with serious stab injuries. He was rushed to a hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.Meanwhile, the police brass has promised all support to Singh’s family, including expediting the process of release of compensation and service benefits.

'We live in fear'



COX'S BAZAR: One day in July, Rafiq slipped out of the world's largest refugee settlement in southern Bangladesh and crossed the border into Myanmar on a small boat. His destination: a ruinous civil war in a nation that he had fled in 2017.Thousands of Rohingya insurgents, like 32-year-old Rafiq, have emerged from camps housing over a million refugees in Cox's Bazar, where militant recruitment and violence have surged this year, according to four people familiar with the conflict and two internal aid agency reports seen by Reuters.""We need to fight to take back our lands,"" said Rafiq, a lean and bearded man in a Muslim prayer cap who spent weeks fighting in Myanmar before returning after he was shot in the leg.""There is no other way.""The Rohingya, a mainly Muslim group that is the world's largest stateless population, started fleeing in droves to Bangladesh in 2016 to escape what the United Nations has called a genocide at the hands of Buddhist-majority Myanmar's military.A long-running rebellion in Myanmar has gained ground since the military staged a coup in 2021. It involves a complex array of armed groups - with Rohingya fighters now entering the fray.Many have joined groups loosely allied with their former military persecutors to fight the Arakan Army ethnic militia that has seized much of the western Myanmar state of Rakhine, from which many Rohingya fled.Reuters interviewed 18 people who described the rise of insurgent groups inside Bangladesh's refugee camps and reviewed two internal briefings on the security situation written by aid agencies in recent months.The news agency is reporting for the first time the scale of recruitment by Rohingya armed groups in the camps, which totals between 3,000 and 5,000 fighters.Reuters is also revealing specifics about failed negotiations between the Rohingya and the Arakan Army, inducements offered by the junta to Rohingya fighters such as money and citizenship documents, as well as about the cooperation of some Bangladesh officials with the insurgency.Several of the people - who include Rohingya fighters, humanitarian workers and Bangladesh officials - spoke on condition of anonymity or that only their first name be used.Bangladesh's government did not respond to Reuters' questions, while the junta denied in a statement to Reuters that it had conscripted any ""Muslims.""""Muslim residents requested protection. So, basic military training was provided in order to help them defend their own villages and regions,"" it said.The two largest Rohingya militant groups - the Rohingya Solidarity Organisation (RSO) and the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) - do not appear to have mass support in the camps in Cox's Bazar, said Shahab Enam Khan , an international relations professor at Bangladesh's Jahangirnagar University.But the emergence of trained Rohingya fighters and weapons in and around the camps is regarded as a ticking time bomb by Bangladesh, one security source said. Some 30,000 children are born each year into deep poverty in the camps, where violence is rife.Disillusioned refugees could be drawn by non-state actors into militant activities and pushed further into criminal enterprises, said Khan. ""This will then suck in regional countries, too.""After a boat-ride from near the camps to the western Myanmar town of Maungdaw around the midyear monsoon, Rohingya insurgent Abu Afna said he was housed and armed by junta troops.In the seaside town where the military is fighting the Arakan Army for control, Rohingya were sometimes even billeted in the same room with junta soldiers.""When I'd be with the junta, I would feel that I am standing next to the same people who raped and killed our mothers and sisters,"" he said.But the Arakan Army is backed by the majority Buddhist ethnic Rakhine community that includes people who joined the military in purging the Rohingya.Reuters this year reported that the Arakan Army was responsible for burning down one of the largest remaining settlements of Rohingya in Myanmar and that the RSO had reached a ""battlefield understanding"" with the Myanmar military to fight alongside each other.""Our main enemy isn't the Myanmar government, but the Rakhine community,"" Abu Afna said.The military provided Rohingya with weapons, training and cash, according to Abu Afna, as well as a Bangladesh source and second Rohingya man who said he was forcibly recruited by the junta.The junta also offered the Rohingya a card certifying Myanmar citizenship.For some, it was a powerful lure. Rohingya have long been denied citizenship despite generations in Myanmar and are now confined to refugee camps where Bangladesh bans them from seeking formal employment.""We didn't go for the money,"" Abu Afna said. ""We wanted the card, nationality.""About 2,000 people were recruited from the refugee camps between March and May through drives employing ""ideological, nationalist, and financial inducements, coupled with false promises, threats, and coercion,"" according to a June aid agency briefing seen by Reuters, which was shared on condition the authors not be named because it was not public.Many of those brought to fight were taken by force, including children as young as 13, according to a U.N. official and two Rohingya fighters.Cash-strapped Bangladesh is increasingly reluctant to take in Rohingya refugees and a person familiar with the matter said some Bangladesh officials believed armed struggle was the only way the Rohingya would return to Myanmar. They also believed that backing a rebel group would give Dhaka more sway, the person said.Bangladesh retired Brig. Gen. Md. Manzur Qader, who has visited the camps, told Reuters his country's government should back the Rohingya in their armed struggle, which he said would push the junta and Arakan Army to negotiate and facilitate the Rohingya's return.Under the previous Bangladesh government, some intelligence officials supported armed groups but with little coordination because there was no overall directive, Qader said.Near the camps in Cox's Bazar, where many roads are monitored by security checkpoints, dozens of Rohingya were taken earlier this year by Bangladesh officials to a jetty overlooking Maungdaw and sent across the border by boat, said Abu Afna, who was part of the group.""It's your country, you go and take it back,"" he recalled one official telling them.Reuters was unable to independently verify his account.In Rakhine state, insurgents struggled to push back the heavily-armed and better drilled Arakan Army. But the battle for Maungdaw has stretched on for six months and Rohingya fighters said tactics including ambushes have slowed the rebel offensive.""The Arakan Army thought they would have a sweeping victory very soon,"" said a Bangladesh official with knowledge of the situation. ""Maungdaw has proven them wrong because of the participation of the Rohingya.""Bangladesh attempted to broker talks between Rohingya and the Arakan Army early this year, but the discussions quickly collapsed, according to Qader and another person familiar with the matter.Dhaka is increasingly frustrated by the Arakan Army's strategy of attacking Rohingya settlements, the two people said, with the violence complicating efforts to repatriate refugees to Rakhine.The Arakan Army has denied targeting Rohingya settlements and said it helps civilians without discriminating on the basis of religion.Back in Cox's Bazar, there is turmoil in the camps, where RSO and ARSA are jostling for influence. Fighting and shootings are common, terrifying residents and disrupting humanitarian efforts.John Quinley, director at human rights group Fortify Rights, said violence was at the highest levels since the camps were established in 2017. Armed groups have killed at least 60 people this year, while abducting and torturing opponents and using ""threats and harassment to try to silence their critics,"" according to a forthcoming Fortify report.Wendy McCance , director of the Norwegian Refugee Council in Bangladesh, warned that international funding for the camp would run out within 10 years and called for refugees to be given ""livelihood opportunities"" to avert a ""massive vacuum where people, especially young men, are being drawn into organised groups to have an income.""Sharit Ullah , a Rohingya man who escaped from Maungdaw with his wife and four children in May, described struggling to secure regular food rations.The one-time rice and shrimp farmer said his biggest worry is the safety of his family amid spiraling violence.""We have nothing here,"" he said, over the shrieks of children playing in the squalid alleyways running like filigree through the camps.""We live in fear.""",Thousands of Rohingya insurgents have emerged from camps housing over a million refugees in Cox's Bazar. Many have joined groups loosely allied with their former military persecutors to fight the Arakan Army ethnic militia. Rohingya have long been denied citizenship in Myanmar and are now confined to refugee camps where violence is rife.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115642281,imgsize-2153227,width-400,resizemode-4/115642281.jpg"

Who was rabbi Zvi Kogan?

Israel announced on Sunday that the body of rabbi Zvi Kogan , who had been missing in the United Arab Emirates , was found. He was killed in what Israel described as a ""heinous antisemitic terror incident .""The UAE's interior ministry later said three suspects were arrested in connection with the killing.A statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israel ""will act with all means to seek justice with the criminals responsible for his death."" Israeli authorities did not explain, however, how they concluded that Kogan’s killing was a terror attack and provided no additional details.A rabbi is a spiritual leader and teacher in Judaism. The term ""rabbi"" means ""teacher"" in Hebrew.Rabbi Kogan, 28, was an envoy of the Chabad Lubavitch organization, an Orthodox Jewish group based in Brooklyn, New York. He had been missing in Dubai since Thursday.Kogan, a dual Israeli-Moldovan citizen, previously served in the Israel defense forces’ Givati Brigade, The Times of Israel reported.He worked in the UAE with other Chabad representatives to support Jewish life in the region and managed a kosher supermarket in Dubai.Chabad Lubavitch, which aims to connect with Jews of various backgrounds, said Kogan was involved in expanding Jewish life in the Emirates. The group’s UAE branch supports Jewish visitors and residents.Kogan had been part of the Abu Dhabi Chabad chapter since the Abraham Accords normalized Israel-UAE relations in 2020.Kogan’s wife, Rivky, a US citizen, lived with him in the UAE. She is the niece of Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg, who was killed in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. US national security council spokesperson Sean Savett said Kogan's killing was ""a horrific crime against all those who stand for peace, tolerance, and coexistence.""""Kogan worked alongside Rabbi Levi Duchman, Rabbi to the United Arab Emirates, and other Chabad emissaries for several years in establishing and expanding Jewish life in the Emirates. Among the many milestones was the founding of the first Jewish education center in the Gulf, and making kosher food widely available,"" Chabad's website says.","Rabbi Zvi Kogan, 28, was an envoy of the Chabad Lubavitch organization.

The missiles have a range of up to 10 miles (16 km) and carry advanced guidance seekers to track and lock onto targets.That Iran and its proxy forces have cloned weapons systems to use against the very adversaries who designed them is not new. Iran, for example, has copied American drones and missiles.But the Almas missile is an example of an increasing use of Iranian-engineered weapons that is ""fundamentally altering regional power dynamics,"" according to Mohammed Al-Basha, a West Asia weapons analyst who runs a risk advisory firm based in Virginia. ""What was once a gradual spread of older missile generations has transformed into rapid deployment of cutting-edge technology across active battlefields,"" Al-Basha said this past week.Almas missiles are among Hezbollah weapons stockpiles that Israeli forces have captured since the start of their invasion of Lebanon about two months ago, said the Israeli defence officials, who requested anonymity.The missiles have stood out as some of the more sophisticated weaponry among a large cache of mostly lower-quality munitions, including Russian-designed Kornet anti-tank missiles. The Wall Street Journal reported this past week that Israeli troops advancing in southern Lebanon were finding large stockpiles of Russian weapons with enhanced Hezbollah's fighting capacity.The Almas, which means diamond in Arabic and Persian, is a guided missile that does not need a direct eye-line sight to launch from land vehicles, drones, helicopters and shoulder-fired tubes. It is a so-called top-attack missile - meaning its ballistic trajectory can strike from directly above its targets instead of from the side and hit tanks where they are lightly armoured and vulnerable. The Almas has threatened Israeli units and equipment near Lebanon's border, Israeli defence officials said. nyt",Hezbollah fighters are believed to have seized the original Israeli Spike anti- tank missiles during the 2006 Israeli-Hezbollah war in Lebanon.

Israel’s military said that Hezbollah fired about 250 rockets and other projectiles into its territory from Lebanon on Sunday, with Hezbollah saying that the attacks targeted areas including Tel Aviv and southern Israel.The militant group said it carried out “an aerial attack using a swarm of attack drones on the Ashdod naval base” in southern Israel.It later announced it had fired “a barrage of advanced missiles and a swarm of attack drones” at a “military target” in Tel Aviv and launched missiles at the Glilot army intelligence base near the city. Hezbollah had previously reported targeting the Glilot base.The Israeli military noted that the highest number of projectiles, 350, was recorded on September 24, 2024.Since September 23, Israel has increased its airstrikes in Lebanon and has sent ground troops to southern Lebanon. The conflict follows nearly a year of limited exchanges of fire initiated by Hezbollah in support of Hamas after Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which led to the Gaza war.Israel's medical agencies said 11 people were injured in strikes, including one man in ""moderate to serious"" condition.

MONTEVIDEO: Left-wing politician Yamandu Orsi was elected president of Uruguay, official results showed on Sunday, in a rebuke by voters of five years of conservative rule.Uruguayans went to the polls for the second round of voting in what became a tight race between Orsi, of the Frente Amplio (Broad Front) alliance, and Alvaro Delgado of the National Party, a member of outgoing President Luis Lacalle Pou's center-right Republican Coalition.Orsi promised in a victory speech on Sunday evening to be a president ""who calls again and again for national dialogue to find the best solutions.""Delgado meanwhile conceded defeat, saying he was sending ""a big hug and a greeting to Yamandu Orsi.""Though the election will shift the balance of power in Uruguay, analysts did not foresee a massive change in the country's economic direction, with Orsi having previously promised ""change that will not be radical.""Both candidates pledged to fight crime linked to drug trafficking and to boost economic growth, which is recovering from the slowdown brought by the Covid-19 pandemic and a historic drought.With 94.4 percent of ballots counted, Orsi won 1,123,420 votes compared to Delgado's 1,042,001, the country's Electoral Court said.Cheers broke out in the capital Montevideo, a bastion of Frente Amplio support, when projections showing Orsi leading were announced.His campaign was boosted by support from Jose ""Pepe"" Mujica, a former guerrilla lionized as ""the world's poorest president"" because of his modest lifestyle during his 2010-2015 time in office.Orsi, seen as an understudy of Mujica, had garnered 43.9 percent of the October 27 first-round vote -- short of the 50 percent needed to avoid a runoff but ahead of the 26.7 percent of ballots cast for Delgado.The pair came out on top of a crowded field of 11 candidates seeking to replace Lacalle Pou, who has a high approval rating but is barred constitutionally from seeking a second consecutive term.Following October legislative elections, Orsi will govern with a majority in the Senate, though the Frente Amplio is in the minority in the Chamber of Representatives.The victory for Orsi will see Uruguay swing left again after five years of center-right rule in the country of 3.4 million inhabitants.In 2005, the Frente Amplio coalition broke a decades-long conservative stranglehold with an election victory and held the presidency for three straight terms.It was voted out in 2020 on the back of concerns about rising crime blamed on high taxes and a surge in cocaine trafficking through the port of Montevideo.Polling numbers ahead of the vote showed perceived insecurity remains Uruguayans' top concern five years later.A 72-year-old retiree who voted, Juan Antonio Stivan, said he just wanted the next government to guarantee ""safety -- to be able to go out in the street with peace of mind, as an old person, as a young person, as a child.""Another voter, Aldo Soroara, a 60-year-old winegrower, said he expected whoever is elected as president to do ""the best he can for the people,"" adding: ""You can't ask for much more in these difficult times.""Voting is compulsory in Uruguay, one of Latin America's most stable democracies, with comparatively high per-capita income and low poverty levels.During the heyday of leftist rule, Uruguay legalized abortion and same-sex marriage, became the first Latin American country to ban smoking in public places and the world's first nation, in 2013, to allow recreational cannabis use.Former president Mujica, who is battling cancer and had to use a cane to walk into his polling station to vote, said Sunday: ""Personally, I have nothing more to look forward to. My closest future is the cemetery, for reasons of age.""But I am interested in the fate of you, the young people who, when they are my age, will live in a very different world.""","Left-wing politician Yamandu Orsi elected president of Uruguay, official results show.

Substantial snowfall is anticipated at elevated areas, with winds possibly reaching 55 mph (88 kph). Approximately 4 feet (1.2 metres) of snow is expected, with the most significant accumulation predicted for Monday and Tuesday.Rain and snow will affect the Midwest and Great Lakes areas on Monday, whilst the East Coast will experience the most significant impact during Thanksgiving and Black Friday.A weather system is expected to bring rainfall to the Southeast early Thursday before moving towards the Northeast. Boston and New York areas might experience rain and strong winds, with possible snow in northern New Hampshire, northern Maine and the Adirondacks. Should the system move further inland, mountain regions might see more rain than snow.""The system doesn't look like a powerhouse right now,"" Hayden Frank, a meteorologist with the weather service in Massachusetts, said Sunday. ""Basically, this is going to bring rain to the I-95 corridor so travellers should prepare for wet weather. Unless the system trends a lot colder, it looks like rain.""Frank indicated that no significant storms are forecast nationwide for the weekend, suggesting favourable driving conditions for Sunday travellers. Eastern temperatures will decrease whilst western regions warm up.Two fatalities occurred in the Pacific Northwest following a rapidly intensifying ""bomb cyclone"" that struck the West Coast last Tuesday. The storm brought strong winds that damaged properties and vehicles and caused widespread power cuts in Washington state before moving to Northern California. Approximately 25,000 Seattle residents remained without electricity on Sunday evening.Two bodies were discovered on Saturday in Sonoma County's wine region, north of San Francisco. A walker found a man's body in a swollen stream near Santa Rosa, whilst rescue teams later recovered another body from a vehicle in floodwaters near Guerneville, according to Deputy Rob Dillion. Investigators are assessing whether these incidents were storm-related.Santa Rosa experienced its wettest three-day period on record, receiving about 12.5 inches (32 centimetres) of rain by Friday evening, according to the San Francisco Bay Area National Weather Service. Flooding affected vineyards in nearby Windsor.The risk of floods and mudslides continues with more rain expected from Sunday, although this system will be less severe than the previous atmospheric river event.""However, there's still threats, smaller threats, and not as significant in terms of magnitude, that are still going to exist across the West Coast for the next two or three days,"" weather service forecaster Rich Otto said.As rainfall moves eastward, substantial snowfall is possible at higher Sierra Nevada elevations and parts of Utah and Colorado. California's Mammoth Mountain, which received 2 feet (.6 metres) of fresh snow recently, might receive an additional 4 feet (1.2 metres) before this system clears by Wednesday.The Midwest and East Coast expect heavy rainfall during Thanksgiving, with possible snow in Northeastern states.Recent precipitation in New York and New Jersey helped address wildfire concerns and drought conditions in Pennsylvania. The rainfall provided welcome relief after an unusually dry autumn.""It's not going to be a drought buster, but it's definitely going to help,"" said Bryan Greenblatt, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Binghamton, New York.Northeastern Pennsylvania, including the Pocono Mountains, experienced heavy snowfall. Higher areas reported up to 17 inches (43 centimetres), with less accumulation in valley cities. About 35,000 customers across 10 counties remained without power.In New York's Catskills region, nearly 10,000 residents lacked power on Sunday morning, following heavy snowfall two days prior.West Virginia's precipitation helped alleviate the state's worst drought in over two decades and benefited ski resorts preparing for their upcoming season.","Winter storm warning for Sierra Nevada continuing until Tuesday.

Virginia Rape: Man charged with town's first 'stranger rape' in over 12 years in Virginia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/man-charged-with-towns-first-stranger-rape-in-over-12-years-in-virginia/articleshow/115636501.cms,"A Virginia hiking trail became the scene of a shocking assault when a Honduran man, recently released from jail for indecent exposure, allegedly raped a woman. Denis Romero, who was in the US illegally, is accused of grabbing the victim, forcing her down, and assaulting her.

A Honduran man faces rape charges after allegedly assaulting a woman on a popular hiking trail in Herndon, Virginia , US. Police said this is the first stranger rape in the town in over a decade.Denis Humberto Navarette Romero , 31, was arrested last week for abduction with intent to defile and rape, according to the Herndon police department . The victim, who did not know Romero, was attacked on the busy Washington and Old Dominion Trail between Ferndale Avenue and Grace Street when the suspect allegedly grabbed her arm, forced her to the ground, and assaulted her.However, the victim managed to escape and sought help from a passerby, who called 911 to report the alleged crime.“The woman had been walking along the trail after leaving a business in downtown Herndon when she was approached by the suspect. The suspect brazenly grabbed the victim and forced her to the ground, where he proceeded to rape her. The victim was able to fight off the suspect and run away,"" said Herndon police chief Maggie DeBoard in a press conference, as quoted by local media FFX Now.When police arrived at the trail, they located Romero in a parking lot in the 700 block of Station Street and took him to the Herndon police station for questioning. Detectives found items belonging to the victim in his possession.'This is the only stranger rape we’ve had in the town in my more than 12 years as chief of police,"" DeBoard added, as quoted by New York Post.Police believe there may be more witnesses to this incident and other victims who encountered the suspect.""He has a documented history of sexual assault and exposures in the region, beginning in 2022, including charges in the town of Herndon prior to last night’s incident,” said DeBoard. “What is disturbing is the number of times this offender has been arrested and released. He has continued to re-offend, and his behavior has escalated to a rape in a very public area in our town last night.”On November 14, four days before being arrested on rape charges, he was released from jail after serving half of a 50-day sentence for indecent exposure.Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin criticised the release of Romero, who is in the US illegally. He told The Post, “I am heartsick for this victim and outraged that local Fairfax County officials recklessly released violent illegal immigrants who should have been prosecuted and deported.”Youngkin added, “This is a dereliction of their most basic duty to keep people safe. Prioritizing violent illegal immigrants over the safety of Fairfax residents is unacceptable,” stressing that Virginia is not a sanctuary state.The suspect's preliminary hearing is scheduled for March 5, 2025, according to a local media report.","Denis Humberto Navarette Romero, 31, was arrested last week for abduction with intent to defile and rape.

How the ICC Decides on Cases





Genocide

War crimes

Crimes against humanity

Crimes of aggression

Decisions to issue arrest warrants follow these key steps:

1. Jurisdiction:

2. Investigation:

3. Authorization:





Who Must Comply



Arresting and transferring the accused to The Hague, where the ICC is headquartered.

Supporting investigations and facilitating evidence collection when requested.

Ensuring that their domestic laws allow for full cooperation with the ICC.

Challenges in Enforcement



With inputs from agencies

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed that Canada would comply with an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . He emphasized that Canada is committed to upholding international law and adhering to the regulations and rulings of international courts, framing this as a core value of Canadian identity.Trudeau said: “It’s really important that everyone abide by international law.This is something we’ve been calling on from the beginning of the conflict. We stand up for international law, and we will abide by all the regulations and rulings of the international courts. This is just who we are as Canadians.""On Thursday, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant, citing allegations of crimes against humanity and other offenses linked to the Israel-Hamas conflict, ongoing for over a year. The court also issued a warrant for Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif, though Israel claims he was killed in a Gaza airstrike in July. Both Israel and Hamas have denied the accusations.Trudeau reiterated Canada’s call for a ceasefire to protect civilians and emphasized the need for progress toward a two-state solution, envisioning peaceful coexistence between Israel and a Palestinian state. Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly echoed this stance, affirming Canada’s commitment to fulfilling its obligations under the ICC treaty.Netanyahu’s office criticized the arrest warrants, labeling them an antisemitic move, while Israel’s Ambassador to Canada, Iddo Moed, urged the Canadian government to reject and condemn the ICC decision, framing it as undermining Israel's right to self-defense.In contrast, the United States, not an ICC member, rejected the warrants outright, citing concerns about the ICC Prosecutor’s process and expressing its intent to coordinate responses with allies. The ICC, lacking its own enforcement mechanism, relies on its 124 member states, including Canada, to act on its rulings.The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others based on allegations of crimes against humanity and other offenses. These charges reportedly stem from actions taken since the start of the prolonged conflict between Israel and Hamas. The court investigates and prosecutes cases of grave crimes, such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, particularly in situations where national legal systems are unable or unwilling to pursue justice.The ICC operates on the basis of complaints submitted to its Prosecutor, who then investigates whether there is sufficient evidence to pursue a case. This can include documentation from affected parties, states, international organizations, or civil society groups.The ICC was established in 2002 under the Rome Statute and has jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute:The ICC determines whether the alleged crimes fall within its jurisdiction, which applies to actions committed on the territory of member states or by nationals of member states.The Prosecutor gathers evidence, often involving extensive collaboration with states, international bodies, and witnesses.If sufficient evidence exists, the court issues an arrest warrant or summons for the individual.4. Charges: The charges must meet the standard of being serious violations of international humanitarian or human rights law.The ICC operates independently but is bound by its treaty and legal frameworks.All 124 member states of the ICC, including Canada, are legally obligated to comply with its rulings and execute arrest warrants if the accused enters their jurisdiction. Compliance involves:States that are not members, like the United States and Israel, are not legally obligated to comply with ICC warrants. However, the ICC may still pursue its cases if the alleged crimes occurred on the territory of a member state or involve nationals of member states.The ICC lacks its own enforcement mechanism, such as a police force, so it relies entirely on member states to cooperate. In many cases, political considerations or opposition to the ICC’s authority can hinder compliance, as seen with resistance from countries whose leaders or officials are targeted by ICC rulings.","The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others.

The Future



In a fact that will make you do a double-take, Pam Bondi and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz are nearly the same age—Bondi at 58 and Walz at 59. Pam Bondi and Tim Walz are both 59 years old. Pam Bondi was born on November 17, 1965, and Tim Walz was born on April 6, 1964.Now, as Bondi’s name floats around as a potential pick for Attorney General under Donald Trump, it’s worth revisiting the meteoric rise of this Florida powerhouse.Pamela Jo Bondi, born November 17, 1965, in Tampa, Florida, is a seasoned attorney, former Florida Attorney General , and prominent figure in conservative circles. Known for her sharp legal mind and media-savvy approach, Bondi made waves during her two terms as Florida’s Attorney General from 2011 to 2019.A graduate of the University of Florida and Stetson University College of Law, Bondi began her career as a prosecutor in Hillsborough County. Her passion for public service and ability to navigate complex legal landscapes quickly elevated her profile within Florida politics.As Florida Attorney General, Bondi tackled major issues, including:Her legal acumen gained national attention in 2020 when she joined Donald Trump's legal team during his first impeachment trial. Her ability to deliver sharp, memorable arguments cemented her place as a trusted Trump ally.However, her career has not been without controversy. Critics have pointed to donations from Trump's foundation to Bondi's political action committee while her office was deciding on a case involving Trump University—a matter she ultimately declined to pursue.Now being floated as a top contender for Attorney General in a potential Trump administration , Bondi’s fiery conservatism and seasoned legal expertise could make her a key figure in the next chapter of Trump’s political saga.In the 2024 US presidential election , Vice President Kamala Harris selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate, but their ticket was decisively defeated by Trump and Vance. The Harris-Walz campaign struggled to connect with working-class voters, facing criticism over economic issues and governance challenges. Despite the loss, Walz’s selection highlighted his leadership record as a progressive governor and former congressman.","Pamela Jo Bondi, born November 17, 1965, is a seasoned attorney, former Florida Attorney General, and prominent figure in conservative circles.

He cited the ""actively hostile and rude"" staff, the ""endless requests for tips,"" the ""disorder"" in line, the ""weak"" dining options and the ""yuck"" lounges. As if salting the wound, he ended by comparing Cairo's airport unfavourably with that of Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, with which Egypt is locked in a yearslong dispute over water rights.It was a verdict almost guaranteed to enrage Egypt's govt, which is making a concerted push to double its tourism numbers, trying to reach 30 million annual visitors by 2028. Luxury hotels are going up . The govt has announced plans to refurbish historic attractions. And a long-awaited new museum of antiquities is opening in stages next to Great Pyramids of Giza.Against this march of progress, Schlappig's complaints might seem like a minor annoyance. Yet Egypt's civil aviation ministry reacted with fury, issuing a more than 1,100-word response this past week, upbraiding Schlappig for his ""unfounded, destructive accusations"" and suggesting it was prepared to take legal action. As evidence, it laid out a step-by-step accounting of the blogger's most recent visit to the airport, drawn from what the ministry called a thorough review of security camera footage. From his first security scan to his arrival at a gate, it said, all went smoothly.By turns self-congratulatory, suspicious and threatening in tone, the ministry defended the airport's quality, saying it holds ""nearly"" four stars from an independent evaluator. It questioned his choices, asking, ""Is it reasonable for a passenger to visit two lounges before a single flight?"" Finally, it ended by accusing him of harbouring sinister motives, saying the sole purpose of his visit appeared to be ""undermining Cairo Airport.""But the blogger quickly fired back ""This is perhaps the most bizarre response,"" wrote Schlappig.

And the book kind of lays out the common arguments that those on the left or others make which are baked in social justice.

Khan has been behind bars for more than a year and has over 150 criminal cases against him. But he remains popular and his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf or PTI, says the cases are politically motivated.Shahid Nawaz, a security officer in eastern Punjab province, said police have arrested more than 4,000 Khan supporters. They include five parliamentarians. Pakistan has sealed off Islamabad with shipping containers and shut down major roads and highways connecting the city with PTI strongholds in Punjab and northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces. Tit-for-tat teargas shelling between the police and the PTI was reported on the highway bordering Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Earlier, Pakistan suspended mobile and internet services ""in areas with security concerns."" The govt and interior ministry posted the announcement on X, which is banned in Pakistan. They did not specify the areas.

Renewed sectarian clashes kill 32 in Pakistan’s northwest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/renewed-sectarian-clashes-kill-32-in-pakistans-northwest/articleshow/115608565.cms,"ISLAMABAD: More than 30 people have been killed and dozens injured in renewed clashes between Sunni and Shia Muslim groups in Pakistan ’s troubled Kurram tribal district in the northwest.The sectarian violence follows Thursday’s deadly attack on a convoy of around 200 vehicles in Kurram that killed around 50 people and injured scores of others.The new clashes erupted soon after funerals for the victims were held in their respective villages on Friday. Adul Nabi Bangash, a local politician in Parachinar, the district headquarters, told TOI that on Friday night a group of Shia Muslims attacked Sunni areas, such as Bagan bazaar, with light and heavy weapons. He revealed that both sides had raised militias soon after Thursday’s incident.A local administration official said the dead in the latest clashes included 18 Shias and 14 Sunnis. Nearly 50 others were wounded in overnight fighting.Dr Qaisar Abbas, a district health officer in Kurram, confirmed the casualties and described the condition of nine wounded as serious.Eyewitnesses said armed men broke into stores, petrol stations, homes and govt buildings in Kurram’s Bagan and Bacha Kot neighbourhoods after Friday prayers. Social media users shared videos and pictures of a burning market with orange flames piercing the night sky. Gunfire can also be heard in the background.Businesses, educational institutions and markets remained closed across Parachinar and surrounding areas for the second consecutive day on Saturday. Describing the situation as extremely tense, officials said mobile phone signals remain suspended across the district. Internet services, however, have been blocked in the region for several months.About 150 people have been killed in recent months due to escalating sectarian violence in the mountainous district, which borders Afghanistan on three sides.Previous clashes in July and Sept, which had killed dozens of people, ended only after a council of elders called for a ceasefire.Meanwhile, thousands of people participated in a sit-in in Parachinar, where protesters criticised govt’s failure to protect civilians. Shop owners in the region had announced a three-day strike on Friday to protest against the attack while locals described an atmosphere of fear across the district.No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, which came a week after authorities had reopened a key highway in the region that had been closed for months following deadly clashes. Speculation also surrounds the involvement of the banned terrorist group Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has recently been active in the lower part of Kurram. But govt officials attributed the incident to a land dispute.","The sectarian violence follows Thursday’s deadly attack on a convoy of around 200 vehicles in Kurram.

In addition, the party wants to speak out against the manipulation of the Feb 8 general elections and demand steps to protect judicial independence, which it claims has been compromised by the 26th Constitutional Amendment. The govt denies this.PM Shehbaz Sharif’s administration has vowed to suppress PTI’s power show with full force and has warned of arrests if anyone comes out to join the demonstration.Govt has deployed security forces, enforced a sweeping ban on gatherings, blocked all roads with shipping containers in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, and launched a crackdown on leaders and workers of the opposition party in a bid to stop the protest.According to police 6,325 officers of the Islamabad police, alongside 21,500 personnel from other forces — 5,000 Rangers (paramilitary force), 5,500 Frontier Constabulary (FC) personnel, 9,000 Punjab police personnel, and 2,000 Sindh police personnel have been deployed to stop PTI protesters from entering the capital city.Responding to criticism over sealing Islamabad and blocking main highways and motorways, defence minister Khawaja Asif described these actions as a “lesser evil”, arguing that allowing protesters into the capital could result in greater devastation.However, Ali Amin Gandapur, PTI’s CM of northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, reiterated the call to all Pakistanis to join the protest. “It is imperative for us to leave our homes to protest the illegal incarceration of Imran Khan,” he proclaimed in a video message. “We all have to reach Islamabad and not leave until our demands are met,” he continued, saying PTI wanted Khan’s release along with the return of its mandate in the last general election, which the party said was rigged to keep it out of power.“Since the protest call is from Imran Khan, we will not go back until our demands are met,” he vowed.Earlier this year Pakistan’s parliament had passed legislation regulating public demonstrations in the capital, including designated protest areas and specific timings for rallies.

PESHAWAR: A mob ransacked and set fire to two police check points on Friday to protest the killing of nearly 50 people by militants in the restive province in northwest Pakistan . Heavily-armed militants on Thursday ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, killing around 50 people, mostly Shias, in one of the worst attacks in the region in recent years.Rescue authorities said around 50 people, including eight women and five children, were killed and 20 others injured in the attack while police initially confirmed 45 deaths. The toll was raised to 47 on Friday.No group claimed responsibility for the attack on passenger vans.On Friday, in response to the Thurday's killings, all markets and educational institutions in Parachinar remained closed even as enraged locals blocked the main road by burning tires.After a lot of protests, the crowd ransacked Bab-e-Kurram, an entry point to Baggan Main Bazar and burnt two police check points at Palachinar.Deputy Commissioner Kurram Javed Ullah Mehsud said efforts are underway to save the lives of those injured in the barbaric shooting. ""We will restore the routine life as quickly as possible,"" he said.A grand jirga (traditional council) will be called to discuss problems hampering restoration of peace in the district.Meanwhile, funeral prayers were offered for the individuals who were killed in the incident in Bagan and Ochit, Lower Kurram.Tribal leaders from Turi and Bangash communities, including Jalal Bangash, expressed their deep concerns.They stated that for the past one and a half months, they had been demanding the government to ensure safe travel routes.Two weeks ago, more than 1,00,000 people participated in a peace march to reopen and secure the main highway, after which the government assured them of safe convoys.In September, more than 50 people were killed and 120 others injured in clashes spread over eight days between Shia and Sunni tribes over a piece of land in Kurram district.The intensity of the fighting had led to the closure of the Parachinar-Peshawar main road and the Pak-Afghan Kharlachi border, disrupting transportation and movement.The road blockade has caused a shortage of essential items, including food, fuel, and medicines, worsening the situation for residents.The fighting had spread to areas such as Balishkhel, Sadda, Khar Kallay, Peewar and Maqbal in the district, which borders Afghanistan's Khost, Paktia, Logar and Nangarhar provinces, which are considered strongholds of the ISIS and the Pakistan Taliban.Similar clashes in the same region in July left dozens of people dead and more than 225 injured.","Heavily-armed militants on Thursday ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

History of sectarian violence in Kurram district

Heavily-armed militants ambushed ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district on Thursday, killing around 50 people, mostly from the minority Shia community. The attack is one of the worst in recent years in Pakistan's volatile northwest, a region frequently plagued by sectarian violence and militant assaults.The convoy was en route from Parachinar to Peshawar when gunmen opened fire. Javed Ullah Mehsud, the deputy commissioner of Kurram, confirmed that 45 people have died in the attack on the convoy, while rescue teams rushed to assist the wounded.Although no group has officially claimed responsibility for the attack, the region is known to be under the influence of the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has been linked to similar attacks in the area.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) government spokespersons indicated that the convoy, initially reported to have included 200 vehicles, was traveling through areas dominated by militant groups, raising fears of further escalations in an already tense region.Pakistan’s President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the ambush, calling it a ""cowardly and inhumane act"" and urging that those responsible be brought to justice. He also called for immediate medical aid for the injured.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif echoed Zardari’s sentiments, terming the attack a “brutal” assault on innocent citizens. ""The enemies of the peace of the country attacked the convoy of innocent citizens which is tantamount to brutality. All attempts of anti-national elements to destroy the peace of the beloved country will be thwarted,"" he stated, promising to track down the perpetrators.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur also condemned the attack, directing a delegation of provincial officials to visit Kurram district to assess the situation and report back. He has also ordered the establishment of a Provincial Highways Police unit to secure roads in the region.""Targeting innocent civilians is extremely tragic and condemnable. Those involved in this incident will not escape the grip of the law,"" Gandapur added, offering condolences to the victims' families and announcing financial assistance for them.The area has long been a hotspot for sectarian tensions between Shia and Sunni Muslims, primarily stemming from a longstanding land dispute.This volatile region has witnessed multiple sectarian clashes this year. In October, at least 16 people, including women and children, were killed in similar violence. In September, more than 50 people were killed and 120 injured in clashes between Shia and Sunni tribes over land disputes. This violence led to the closure of critical roads and disrupted essential services in the area. Similar clashes in July resulted in dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries.Kurram district borders Afghanistan’s Khost, Paktia, Logar, and Nangarhar provinces, known as strongholds for groups like ISIS and the Pakistani Taliban, complicating efforts to curb violence in the area.","Militants ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district on Thursday, killing around 50 people.

It, however, did not give any details about when the military operation would be launched and in which parts of the province.Restive Balochistan, Pakistan’s biggest province by area but poor in terms of development, has been home to a nearly two-decade-old insurgency by separatist militant groups of ethnic Baloch nationals who carry out frequent attacks against the govt, army, and Chinese interests in the region.
