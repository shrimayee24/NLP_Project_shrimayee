'Girl was on fire and screaming in pain'



NEW DELHI: The man, who saved the 15-year-old girl from Odisha's Puri district after she was set ablaze by unidentified men, recounted the harrowing 90 minutes after she knocked on his door, screaming for help, ""save me, save me. ""A 15-year-old girl, allegedly set on fire by three masked men in Odisha’s Puri district, was transferred to AIIMS New Delhi, where she remains in stable condition with 70-75%burn injuries.The class 9 dropout was walking to a relative’s home around 8.30am Saturday when she was reportedly intercepted near a river embankment, rendered unconscious by a chemical-lacedcloth, and doused with kerosene before being set ablaze.Screaming for help, she fled to a nearby house, where Dukshishyam Senapati extinguished the flames and gave her fresh clothes.Recalling the harrowing moment, Senapati said that when he answered his door, he was stunned to find the girl engulfed in flames and crying in agony, as he later explained to DGP YB Khurania during the official's site visit.""It was around 8.30 am when the girl came to my house, screaming. With the help of my wife, I doused the fire and gave her water as she was very thirsty.Later, the women of my family changed her clothes,"" he said.Upon questioning, the girl informed Senapati that three unidentified men had set her ablaze. She explained being abducted by motorcycle-riding assailants whilst returning from meeting a friend.""She said she was walking back home after meeting a friend when she was picked up by three men who arrived on motorcycles. The faces of these men were half-covered, and they took her to a place near the Bhargavi riverbank. She could not tell their names. She could only say that they covered her face with a handkerchief and poured some substance before setting her on fire,"" he said.Senapati noticed that although the girl mentioned being bound during the abduction, her hands were free when she arrived. After learning her father's details, he contacted her family. The large crowd that gathered prevented further conversation with the victim.Despite searching the area, Senapati couldn't locate the perpetrators. He explained that the attackers fled after setting her alight, presumably expecting her to perish. However, the girl managed to escape and reach his house.Due to delayed ambulance response, they resorted to an auto rickshaw for hospital transport. The girl remained at his residence for approximately 90 minutes.The incident has created fear in the village, particularly among children who are now afraid to venture out alone. Senapati urged swift arrest of the culprits.","Dukshishyam Senapati saved the 15-year-old girl from Odisha's Puri district after she was set ablaze by unidentified men.

PM reply unlikely

NDA allies

want Sindoor debate to highlight govt achievements

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Sunday expressed its readiness to discuss all “important issues” in the monsoon session of Parliament raised by opposition parties, including Operation Sindoor and repeated claims by US President Donald Trump that he had facilitated the ceasefire between India and Pakistan.At the customary floor leaders’ meeting ahead of the session beginning on Monday, opposition raised various issues, including voter rolls revision in Bihar, “lapses” leading to the Pahalgam attack and Trump’s claims.“We are very open to a discussion... These are issues of great national importance. Govt is not shying away and will never shy away, but is open to discussions within rules and conventions,” parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said following the meeting chaired by Union minister J P Nadda.Sources said that there was no assurance about a discussion on the special intensive revision (SIR) of the electoral rolls in Bihar, about which opposition parties have been vocal and critical of Election Commission.Centre’s “reluctance” to discuss EC’s role on the floor of the House also stems from the fact that NDA partners, including JDU, have not raised questions about the Bihar SIR after their own surveys found no irregularities.JDU’s Sanjay Kumar told reporters there were reports that people did not have any issue with the SIR.Normally, defence minister Rajnath Singh, who is deputy leader of Lok Sabha, chairs the floor leaders’ meeting, but he was reportedly unwell and skipped the meeting attended by 54 members from different parties and independent MPs.“We have noted all the points. We have requested all parties to ensure Parliament functions properly. We have to ensure coordination. It is responsibility of all to help Parliament function,” Rijiju said, adding that govt would reply appropriately whenever a discussion takes place on Trump’s ceasefire claims.Although Centre indicated its willingness to respond to Trump’s claims, it will be walking a tightrope. Govt will need to be careful in its response, considering Trump’s position, to ensure that bilateral relations, especially at a time when they are on the verge of signing a trade treaty, remain unaffected.INDIA bloc insisted PM Narendra Modi should respond on the US president’s “ceasefire” claims and the SIR in Bihar. Sources said the PM is unlikely to respond in Parliament on these issues, and the respective ministers will present govt’s point of view.Sources said even BJP’s allies want a discussion on Operation Sindoor to highlight govt’s achievements after all-party delegations visited various nations.At the meeting, Congress’s deputy leader in Lok Sabha Gaurav Gogoi demanded a discussion on “lapses” that led to Pahalgam attack, Operation Sindoor, statements by J&K LG, Chief of Defence Staff, Deputy Chief of Army Staff, and Trump’s claims. Other opposition parties also raised these issues.","Opposition raised various issues, including voter rolls revision in Bihar, “lapses” leading to the Pahalgam attack and Trump’s claims. “We are very open to a discussion...

NEW DELHI: A new development came in the Balashore self-immolation case, where the victim's friend on Friday claimed that the HoD threatened to fail her if she didn't fulfil his demands and accused the principal of provoking her to reach such an extent that she killed herself.The victim, a 20-year-old second-year B.Ed student at Fakir Mohan (Autonomous) College, Balasore, died after setting herself ablaze on July 12 outside the college gate during a peaceful protest that had been ongoing since July 1, demanding action against the head of the education department.The B.Ed student's friend Koshish Das also said that the HoD has been doing this for six months with her.""All of this was going on with her for six months... On 30 June, she told us that the HoD had stooped to the extent of telling her, 'I will fail you. I will keep you in this class for six years. You will not be able to leave this college till I am here.' Her backlogs were deliberately not being cleared. She was extremely depressed... She told us that she wants support to go and talk to the principal about this. We submitted an application to the principal, requesting immediate action..."" she said.Giving details about the July 12 incident, Das said, ""she wanted to speak to the principal... She kept waiting outside the principal's chamber, since there was a large crowd for admissions. We waited there for two hours, but then we told her, 'Let's have our lunch, and afterwards we can talk to the principal.' But before we could come back, we were told that she had lit herself on fire. By the time we got back, the college had been sealed, and I couldn't even see what condition she was in.

These students were in opposition to her (the victim), since she was in ABVP.

NEW DELHI: The fact-finding committee constituted by the University Grants Commission (UGC) has held KIIT Deemed to be University, Bhubaneswar, responsible for the suicide of two students earlier this year, stating that ""illegal and unlawful activity by the university"" led to one of the deaths and that the administration's actions ""amount to criminal liability. ""Along with these findings, the committee has issued a set of strong recommendations, based on which the commission is contemplating a freeze on the university's expansion and departmental action against erring officials, among others. The UGC committee, chaired by Professor Nageshwar Rao, submitted its report on May 20, 2025, after campus visits, stakeholder interactions, and detailed analysis.The report cited the university's failure to act lawfully on sexual harassment complaints, inadequate hostel facilities, excessive student intake, and use of brute force on students as key failings contributing to the incidents.The committee's observations and findings include serious lapses in infrastructure and governance. It found that hostel facilities were ""substandard"" with ""three students put in a small room"" and female international students accommodated without cultural considerations. It also noted that complaints of sexual harassment were ignored or illegally compromised, that the administration forcibly removed Nepalese students without support, and that security personnel used physical aggression against students.The university, it said, prioritised its ""reputation of university over regulations, law of land and international relations of the country.""Observing that members of the internal complaints committee (ICC) and senior administrative personnel of the university ""are liable for criminal punishment as per law"", the report stated, ""... university's internal complaints committee (ICC) failed to take lawful action in reported sexual harassment cases. There was no transparency that protocols for investigation were followed. The girl had made complaints to the administration twice much before this tragic incident. In both the complaints, they decided to go for illegal compromise... The university has the power to punish the boy even when the first complaint was lodged. Instead of punishment, they favoured the boy by pushing forced illegal compromise with the girl. Later on, this has led to suicide. This suicide case could have been averted.""On Feb 16, Prakriti Lamsal, a third-year BTech student from Nepal, was found dead in her hostel room. The report also called for departmental action against ICC members who acted in violation of rules. ""Had KIIT University taken action to decide the reported harassment case as per law in the first case, the tragedy could have been avoided,"" the report stated.On May 2, another Nepalese undergraduate student was found dead in her hostel room at KIIT.","A fact-finding committee has held KIIT Deemed to be University, Bhubaneswar responsible for the suicide of two students earlier this year.

The trio shared the wedding stage, danced to traditional folk music, and received blessings from village elders as hundreds of relatives and locals looked on - in a rare public affirmation of the ancient custom of polyandry.Pradeep works with Jal Shakti department. Kapil is employed in the hospitality sector overseas. Sunita is a trained technician from an industrial training institute (ITI).""This is not just a marriage - it's a moment of pride,"" said Hira Singh, a relative of the grooms. ""Our educated youth have shown the courage to embrace what many keep secret. They've set an example.""Polyandry remains a socially accepted practice among the Hatti community, which numbers about 300,000 in Sirmaur and is spread across five tehsils and 154 panchayats, including Shillai, Sangrah, Kamrau, Rajgarh, and Nohradhar.Amichand Kamal, president of Kendriya Haati Samiti said, ""Polyandry was the norm in tribal societies as it protected land holdings and avoided widowhood. A woman has more freedom-she can choose her husbands and leave them without stigma.""What made this wedding stand out wasn't the custom - but its visibility. ""Polyandry may seem primitive to outsiders, but it's legal in our context. Usually these marriages happen quietly,"" Kamal said. ""But this one was public. That makes it powerful.""The tradition was once widespread across tribal belts like Lahaul-Spiti and Kinnaur. But as nuclear families grew and youth migrated toward city jobs, the practice withered.""It has nearly vanished in Lahaul-Spiti and Kinnaur,"" said Shamsher Singh, a research scholar on folk art from Lahaul-Spiti. ""But in trans-Giri and Jaunsar-Bawar of Uttarakhand, it survives, largely because of the Mahabharata's cultural imprint.""Many Hattis believe they descend from the Kauravas or Pandavas.

Kottayam: Is there a connection between jackfruit and detection of alcohol in one's breath? A breathalyser test at a Kerala State Road Transport Corporation depot in Pathanamthitta apparently found one.A bus driver who consumed jackfruit before joining duty failed a breathalyzer test at the Pandalam KSRTC depot on Friday. An official, who did not wish to be identified, said that another driver brought jackfruit harvests from his house to the depot and shared it with his colleagues. The driver in question consumed a good amount of the fruit, the official said.As routine, he then underwent the breathalyzer test. But to his shock, the meter rose from 0 to 10 within seconds. The driver insisted that he was not drunk and even challenged the authorities to conduct a blood test. Three other staff members also failed the test. Finally, the authorities concerned decided to put the breathalyzer itself under the scanner.An official who was assigned to conduct the breathalyzer test took the assessment with the meter showing zero. However, when he underwent the test after consuming jackfruit, the meter reading went up, showing he was drunk, said the official.

NASHIK/CHHATRAPATI SAMBHAJINAGAR: Two videos purportedly showing Maharashtra agriculture minister Manikrao Kokate playing an online card game during an assembly session culminated Sunday in a full-blown political clash, including violence involving NCP and a Maratha outfit, as the stakes kept rising in what had started as a social media controversy.The confrontation peaked at NCP state president Sunil Tatkare's presser in Latur, where members of Chhava Sanghatna threw playing cards at him while demanding Kokate's resignation. The symbolic protest quickly descended into violence when local NCP workers allegedly assaulted the protesters after Tatkare left the venue, with one activist being injured after being struck on the head with a chair.The row began when opposition MLA Rohit Pawar of NCP (SP) posted the videos on X, claiming they showed Kokate too busy gaming to be bothered about House proceedings. The allegation gained enough traction within hours to trigger protests.In Nashik, Kokate dismissed the allegations as deliberate misrepresentation. The minister said he was attempting to monitor Lower House proceedings from the Upper House of Maharashtra's bicameral legislature when an online gaming advertisement appeared on his phone.""I tried to skip it a couple of times, but couldn't. Finally, on my third attempt, it worked,"" Kokate explained, accusing Pawar of selectively editing the footage to suit his narrative.""The MLA chose to show only the part that suited him instead of showing the complete video,"" Kokate said, dismissing the controversy as an attempt by the opposition to defame a BJP-led govt ""doing good work"".At NCP's Latur presser, Chhava Sanghatna, led by Vijaykumar Ghadge, initially submitted a memorandum to Tatkare seeking Kokate's resignation before the card-throwing protest. After the NCP state chief left the venue, local party politicians allegedly confronted the Maratha activists in a nearby room, where the situation turned violent despite police's attempts to maintain order.No arrests had been made till late Sunday, although the alleged retaliation drew sharp criticism from across the political spectrum. Ghadge-Patil condemned what he claimed was an attack by ""NCP goons"". He said Chhava Sanghatna, which he described as an organisation of ""farmers' sons"", would retaliate.NCP spokesperson Suraj Chavan defended the party workers' actions as a ""natural reaction"" to alleged attempts to humiliate party functionaries. He acknowledged Chhava Sanghatna's right to democratic protest, but suggested the card-throwing protest was out of line.Vidya Chavan of NCP (SP) termed the assault on the protesters ""horrible"", saying that questioning politicians' actions was a democratic right. She urged minister Kokate to ""speak the truth and accept his mistake"".Throughout the controversy, Kokate maintained that his detractors like Rohit Pawar had been focusing on trivial matters - ""my clothes, my cars and such things"" - rather than the govt's agricultural policies. He said the legislator would have highlighted the govt's work if he had farmers' interests in mind.The minister declared that the opposition's focus on such issues reflected its inability to find genuine governance concerns.","Two videos purportedly showing Maharashtra agriculture minister Manikrao Kokate playing an online card game during an assembly session.

Suspect on run after stealing firetruck, causing massive amount of damage





A fire truck theft in Washington state on Friday night led to extensive damage and multiple vehicle collisions.The incident occurred when an Everett Fire Department vehicle was taken from Hoyt Avenue, situated 30 miles north of Seattle, whilst firefighters attended a medical emergency at an apartment building's fifth floor, according to the department's update on Saturday morning, quoted by NBC News.The thief drove the fire engine at high speeds through north Everett's residential areas, causing considerable damage to parked vehicles and landscaping across five locations before abandoning the vehicle. The theft was discovered after 11 pm (Local time) when the first 911 call reported a hit-and-run incident. Witnesses reported that the fire truck had struck two parked vehicles at high speed before leaving the scene.The vehicle eventually came to a halt in the 1000 block of E Marine View Drive after colliding with at least ten parked vehicles. The Everett Police Department responded to at least six locations where damage to parked cars, trees, directional signs and grass was reported. Fortunately, no injuries occurred at any of the sites.“Losing a fire engine in such a reckless manner not only jeopardizes the safety of our first responders but also puts our community at risk,” said Everett Police Chief John DeRousse said in a statement, quoted by NY Post.The 2018 Pierce Enforcer pumper truck, which retailed between Rs 4 crore and Rs 8 crore, was severely damaged and had to be taken out of service.The stolen vehicle, a 2018 Pierce Enforcer Pumper weighing approximately 35,000 pounds, sustained significant damage and has been impounded as evidence. The fire truck, one of the department's newer engines, is particularly dangerous when moving due to its substantial weight.Everett Police Chief John DeRousse said, ""Losing a fire engine to such a reckless person not only jeopardizes the safety of our first responders but also puts our community at risk. We are committed to ensuring the safety of our residents, and any information that helps us resolve this incident is crucial.

Luis Leon, an 82-year-old Pennsylvania resident, was unexpectedly deported to Guatemala after visiting a US immigration office to replace his lost green card.Leon had been living in Allentown for decades after being granted political asylum in the US in 1987, following torture under Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet’s regime.He had lost his wallet containing the physical card that confirmed his legal residency, according to The Morning Call report cited by the Guardian. Therefore, Leonus and his wife had booked an appointment at an immigration office for 20 June to have the card replaced.However, upon arrival, Leon was suddenly handcuffed by two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and led away without explanation, his wife said. She was allegedly held inside the building for 10 hours before relatives came to collect her. The family said they then heard nothing about Leon’s whereabouts, despite numerous attempts to contact authorities.Days later, they received a phone call from a woman claiming to be an immigration lawyer who said she could assist, but she did not explain how she knew about the case or where Leon was being held. On 9 July, the same woman contacted the family again and told them Leon had died.However, in a shocking twist, the family learned a week later through a relative in Chile that Leon was, in fact, alive, but hospitalised in Guatemala, a country with which he has no known connection. The relative said Leon had initially been detained in an immigration facility in Minnesota before being deported, although his name did not appear on any public ICE deportation lists.His family remains in the dark about how and why he was removed to Guatemala. A recent US Supreme Court ruling had allowed the Trump-era policy permitting deportations to third countries, not just countries of origin, to stand.Leon, who had spent nearly four decades in the US working at a leather manufacturing plant and raising a family, had since retired. His medical condition remains unclear, but relatives say that he suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure and a heart condition. They now planning to travel to Guatemala to be by his side.The case is currently under investigation.","Luis Leon, 82, was granted political asylum in the US in 1987 following torture under Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet’s regime.

Trump-Epstein ties under scrutiny: Sexual harassment allegations by Maria Farmer in 1996 resurface; White House reacts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-epstein-ties-under-scrutiny-sexual-harassment-allegations-by-maria-farmer-in-1996-resurface-white-house-reacts/articleshow/122804376.cms,"



Renewed attention is being drawn to former associates of Jeffrey Epstein which includes sexual harassment allegations made in 1996 by artist Maria Farmer . At the time, Farmer, then in her mid-20s, alerted law enforcement not only to Epstein’s alleged abuse but also raised concerns about the powerful circle surrounding him- including now-US President Donald Trump , then a New York real estate magnate.Farmer’s original account, recently revisited by The New York Times, included a troubling encounter involving her younger sister at Epstein’s New Mexico ranch and a series of interactions with high-profile individuals in Epstein’s social orbit. While Farmer never accused Trump of criminal behavior, she expressed discomfort over his presence and alleged conduct, recounting an incident in 1995 at Epstein’s Manhattan office where Trump allegedly stared at her legs until Epstein intervened, reportedly saying, “No, no. She's not here for you.”Farmer’s warning to the FBI and other law enforcement agencies in 1996 and again in 2006 went largely unheeded at the time. No records of her report have been publicly released, and many relevant documents in Epstein's case remain redacted or sealed. Nevertheless, Farmer’s testimony has gained renewed significance amid growing political controversy over what the still-unreleased Epstein investigative files may contain.Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. Law enforcement officials have consistently stated that the president is not a target of any investigation related to the disgraced financier. Still, Farmer's early allegations have raised questions about whether his name may appear in sealed federal files, even if only tangentially.The matter has become increasingly politicized. Trump's allies have repeatedly pushed for full public disclosure of the Epstein files, arguing that selective transparency could be used to tarnish political reputations. However, Attorney General Pam Bondi recently reversed earlier commitments to release additional materials, stating a review found no basis for new charges- a decision that has only added to the speculation.Farmer's allegations stand out because of how early they were made and the broader context they highlighted. She worked for Epstein in 1995 and 1996, initially helping acquire artwork and later managing his Upper East Side townhouse. In 1996, she reported being sexually assaulted by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at his estate in Ohio- years before the financier was first indicted.Despite skepticism at the time, her family, including her mother and sister, supported her account and confirmed that she had named Trump among the powerful men she feared were being protected. Still, there is no public record indicating whether the FBI followed up on her claims or investigated Trump’s ties to Epstein further.The White House has dismissed Farmer’s claims. “The president was never in Epstein’s office,” said White House communications director Steven Cheung. “The fact is that the president kicked him out of his club for being a creep.” Trump himself has emphasized that he ended his relationship with Epstein decades ago, despite previously referring to him as a “terrific guy” and being captured on video attending social events together in the 1990s and early 2000s.Also read: Jeffrey Epstein's ex girlfriend Stacey Williams on Trump-Epstein bond; describes duo as ‘bro’ and ‘wingman’ In 2019, Epstein was arrested on federal charges of trafficking minors. He died in jail weeks later, with officials ruling his death a suicide. The fallout from his arrest and the continuing secrecy around much of the investigation has left a cloud of suspicion over many of his past associates- particularly those with political influence.Amid calls for transparency, Trump has recently supported the release of grand jury testimony related to Epstein, stating he has “nothing to hide.” However, legal experts note that even if released, such records may offer limited insight into his relationship with Epstein, which did not feature in the primary criminal proceedings.","Maria Farmer, then in her mid-20s, alerted law enforcement not only to Epstein’s alleged abuse but also raised concerns about the powerful circle surrounding him.

There are 105 families on the island and many have opposed the move.The Lakshadweep revenue department has issued a notification, dated July 11, for a social impact assessment (SIA). It stated that the intention was to transfer the entire island to defence and strategic agencies considering its “strategic location” and “national security relevance”.Lakshadweep MP Hamdullah Sayeed alleged that the move was aimed at disrupting peace in the area and would be opposed tooth and nail.Lakshadweep MP vows to fight for Bitra islandersIn a video message, Lakshadweep MP Hamdullah Syeed asked Bitra natives not to worry or be anxious about the notification.“As your MP, we held a conference that included leaders from Bitra and Lakshadweep and discussed it in detail. We have decided to fight with the people of Bitra, politically and legally,” he said.Sayeed said the government had already acquired land required for defence purposes on several islands.Targeting Bitra, which has had an indigenous population for decades, without considering any alternative, is unacceptable. He also criticised the administration for not holding any consultation with the islanders.The notification said that a Social Impact Assessment (SIA) was needed as per provisions of the Right to Fair Compensation and Trans- parency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. Naming the department of revenue as the project developer, it said SIA activities included consultations with all stakeholders of the proposed area, including the gram sabha.“The SIA and Consent Society, UT of Lakshadweep, will complete the survey of the proposed area under acquisition within two months from the date of the notification,” it said, adding that consent of gram sabhas and/or landowners was not mandatory.","The Lakshadweep revenue department has issued a notification, dated July 11, for a social impact assessment (SIA) The intention was to transfer the entire island to defence and strategic agencies considering its ‘strategic location’ and ‘national security relevance’ There are 105 families on the island.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122772958,imgsize-2953706,width-400,resizemode-4/122772958.jpg"

3. Has the team responded to Donald Trump’s demand?

In a fiery twist to the Washington Commanders’ search for a new stadium, U.S. President Donald Trump has inserted himself into the debate—threatening to block the team’s proposed $4 billion stadium deal unless it changes its name back to the ""Redskins."" The team rebranded as the Commanders in 2022 following growing criticism over the racially insensitive nature of the previous name. But Trump is now using his political leverage to demand a reversal.Taking to his platform Truth Social, Donald Trump didn't mince words. ""I may put a restriction on them that if they don't change the name back to the original 'Washington Redskins,' and get rid of the ridiculous moniker 'Washington Commanders,' I won't make deal for them to build a stadium in Washington,"" he wrote.This declaration not only brings political pressure into the NFL but also reopens a cultural wound many hoped had started healing. Trump insists that reviving the old name would increase the franchise’s value and restore its traditional legacy.Trump’s message was broader than just Washington’s NFL team. He also criticized the Cleveland Guardians, formerly the Indians, accusing the Dolan family of erasing cultural identity.In his post, Trump wrote: “Our great Indian people, in massive numbers, want this to happen. Their heritage and prestige are systematically being taken away from them... OWNERS, GET IT DONE!!!” The former president has even launched a campaign dubbed MIGA: Make Indians Great Again.Despite increasing noise around the name change, team owner Josh Harris has previously made it clear there are no plans to revert.

Justice Maria Carroccia has spent a lifetime in the trenches of criminal law—from defending clients in Windsor’s busiest courtrooms to overseeing complex trials from the bench. But now, all eyes are on her as she prepares to deliver one of the most anticipated rulings in Canadian legal history: the verdict in the Hockey Canada sexual assault trial.Before taking on the Hockey Canada case, Justice Maria Carroccia presided over a lengthy and emotionally charged murder trial in Windsor, where three men were convicted in the killing of a young woman over drugs and money. Known for her calm demeanor and legal precision, her courtroom style has earned praise from even the most seasoned lawyers. “She’s very steady, very calm,” said Toronto defence attorney Christopher Hicks. “She would listen to you. I want to be able to discuss the law with the judge.”Carroccia, a former top defence lawyer and daughter of Italian immigrants, was appointed to the Superior Court in 2020. Her approach is grounded in empathy and clarity. “A judge’s decision ought to make sense to an ordinary person, not just to lawyers, scholars and other judges,” she once wrote.That guiding principle will be especially important on July 24, when she delivers her judgment in a case involving five former NHL players accused of a 2018 group sexual assault in London, Ontario.Amid two failed jury selections and mounting public scrutiny, Carroccia made the bold decision to proceed with the case without a jury. It was a pivotal move that, according to Hicks, kept the trial from unraveling: “They all got on board because of her.” As the country waits, Justice Carroccia’s verdict will be more than a legal outcome—it will be a defining moment.Also Read: Hockey Canada sexual assault trial: Legal reckoning nears for ex-Hockey Canada players as judge weighs verdict Justice Maria Carroccia, a seasoned criminal law expert and former defence lawyer, is presiding over the case.The verdict is scheduled to be delivered on July 24, 2025.They are each charged with sexual assault in connection with an alleged 2018 incident following a Hockey Canada gala.","Justice Maria Carroccia is set to deliver the verdict in the highly anticipated Hockey Canada sexual assault trial on July 24, 2025.

KOLKATA: Residents of Natun Pally in Saradamoyee Lane, Regent Park, found it difficult to comprehend how Ritam Mondal, one of the brightest youths from the locality, could have died.They saw him excel in studies and then get into IIT four years ago.

According to him, Ritam was a jovial person and never misbehaved or quarrelled with anyone. ""The bonding between Ritam and his parents was also good. There was never any tension between them.

NOIDA: Jyoti Jhangra’s project ﬁles will be central to the investigation into circumstances in which she died by suicide on July 18 at her hostel room in Sharda University.The second-year BDS student had just emerged from a difﬁcult week when she was accused of forging a professor’s signature on her ﬁle, after which her father was called to the campus on July 14.The signature controversy left the 21-year-old deeply affected, according to her classmates, but just three days before she died by suicide, Jyoti seemed to be bouncing back. She sported a new haircut, attended all her classes, did her lab work, and was looking forward to a trip with friends after the semester exams.Barely 3-4 hours before she was found dead in her hostel room, Jyoti allegedly had a meltdown at a fellow hosteller’s room that was triggered by a visit to the staff room, one of her closest friends told TOI on Sunday. What caused it? Based on accounts from this friend, who is also a batchmate and part of a closely knit group of ﬁve girls, and coursemates, here’s what happened between July 10 and 18.JYOTI had to submit a project for her dental material course. It was a denture sample. In the bachelor of dental science course, all students need to get sample submissions signed. Jyoti had gone to an assistant professor who teaches the course for her signature on her submission.The professor, after looking at the ﬁle, questioned a previous sign on it, accusing Jyoti of forging it. She also refused to sign the current submission. “Jyoti was in tears after this,” said the close friend and batchmate. “The professor scolded Jyoti and asked her not to show her face in class again. Jyoti said she had not forged any sign. I told her to let it go but she was in distress.”Ramesh met the head of the department and other professors on the signature issue. What transpired during the discussion is not known since there has been no ofﬁcial word from the department or the university on this. But according to Ramesh’s account to police – which was corroborated by Jyoti’s close friend and classmates who TOI spoke to – the discussion was an amicable one and the outcome one that had reassured both Ramesh and Jyoti. “They were assured by the HOD that there will be no issues henceforth with her samples and obtaining signatures,” the friend quoted above told TOI. This echoes Ramesh’s version to police. However, according to the friend, all still wasn’t well. “Jyoti told me though the HOD spoke nicely to her father, the professors were still hostile to her. She was, however, coping and looked better after that day.It’s this episode that led to Jyoti’s father Ramesh being called to the campus. Ramesh has also mentioned this in his police complaint, saying he had brought up during the interaction harassment and misbehaviour by her teachers that his daughter had complained of and had been assured that she would face no such problems. It’s this that seems to have settled Jyoti’s nerves somewhat, according to the classmates.The professor she met is among the two faculty members arrested after her death. In her note, Jyoti speciﬁcally accused these two professors of mental harassment. Both faculty members are now in judicial custody.That day, classes didn’t go smoothly for Jyoti. According to Ramesh’s police complaint, an assistant professor allegedly at the PCP (preclinical prosthodontics) class pulled Jyoti up and told her she would be punished for “complaining too much”. It’s not clear what these complaints were about and whether it had anything to do with Ramesh bringing up her teachers’ behaviour in his meeting with the HOD.""I met Jyoti 15 minutes before the 11am class,” said her close friend. “I was going to collect my admit card from the admin ofﬁce. Jyoti looked alright. She went to the class. We had a second class from 2pm to 4pm. The class got suspended, although we did not get any ofﬁcial intimation about it. So Jyoti went to the lab to complete her samples.”Exams were knocking on the door, so students wanted to waste no time on getting their coursework complete and submissions approved. Jyoti, who already had some catching up to do, decided to use the free time gainfully. Having completed her samples, she went to meet a senior faculty member – an associate professor who teaches the dental material course – for his signature. He was in the staff room and so were some of their other professors. It was here that July 10 allegedly played out again.“Jyoti was in anguish when she returned from the staff room. She told me the professor had told her, ‘tum toh apna sign khud hi kar leti ho’ (you sign your own projects) and made fun of her,” said the friend. “She was told to rework her dental sample. Having failed to get this professor’s signature, Jyoti went to another professor, this time to her PCP samples signed. But this professor also accused her of forging signs. She went back crying to the lab to redo her samples. Around 4pm, she said that she was going to her room,” said the friend, who was also in the lab.Nobody except a fellow hosteller at Mandela saw Jyoti after this. Jyoti’s mother has claimed Jyoti didn’t take her call at 5pm. “She went to her hostel friend’s room and was there from 5.30-7pm. Jyoti cried a lot there. She told the friend to take both theory and practical seriously before going back to her room,” said the close friend. Around 9pm, Jyoti was found dead in her room.Besides the two arrested professors, the dean of the school of dental studies, the HOD and two more faculty members have been named in the FIR based on the father’s complaint. Sharda University has formed a committee for a probe. QUESTIONS THAT REMAIN What is not clear, and on which the investigations by police and the university will throw light on, is why Jyoti’s project signs were being repeatedly questioned. Was she indeed being targeted or was there a previous instance of a dodgy sign that the faculty referred to? Her classmates said they were not aware of any such thing, but the university is yet to comment on this. TOI reached out about this to a faculty member, who said, “She was doing BDS, and to get a license, an audit takes place by a govt ofﬁcial.If her practicals were not up to the mark and the professors asked her to redo it, she should have taken things positively as it was for her betterment. If an audit ﬁnds practicals not up to the mark, even a college’s license can be suspended and the afﬁliation can go for a toss.” A classmate, however, said Jyoti’s scores weren’t bad. “She had scored 368 out of 600 in the ﬁrst year. It is necessary to submit the project ﬁle before appearing in the written exam. Jyoti was under stress because she did not have a sign,” said the classmate.","Jyoti Jhangra, 21, was found dead in her hostel room on July 18. The second-year BDS student had just emerged from a difﬁcult week when she was accused of forging a professor’s signature on her ﬁle. The signature controversy left the 21-year-old deeply affected, according to her classmates.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122804469,imgsize-73108,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/122804469.jpg"

Poll Do you believe that social media can play a role in criminal investigations? Yes, it can provide crucial evidence. No, it can mislead investigations.





NEW DELHI: While investigating the murder of a 36-year-old man in southwest Delhi's Dwarka, police claimed to have stumbled upon Instagram chats between his wife and her lover that implicated them in the killing.The woman Sushmita, 35, is alleged to be having an affair with a relative named Rahul, 24, and planned the killing of her husband, Karan Dev. They drugged Dev by giving him sleeping pills before electrocuting him to death on July 13, an investigator disclosed on Saturday.The probe revealed that the duo gave Dev 15 sleeping pills at dinner. The chats showed that they had Googled about the time it would take for the sleeping pills to cause death. ""Check once how long it takes to die after taking the medicine. It's been three hours since he ate food. No vomiting. And no death yet either,"" says one chat from Sushmita to Rahul, who replies, ""If you can't figure anything out, give him a shock."" Sushmita then asked Rahul how to tie Dev to administer the electric shock and Rahul suggested using a tape.In another message, she says that Dev was breathing slowly and Rahul asks her to give him more pills.Sushmita responds, ""I can't get his mouth open. I can pour water in, but I can't give the medicine. You come here, maybe together we can manage to feed it to him.""Eventually, Dev did stop breathing, after which Sushmita raised an alarm. Dev was later taken to hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. According to cops, Sushmita claimed at the hospital that Dev had suffered an electric shock.Also Read: Two men kill their wives suspecting fidelity in separate incidents During the probe and when the autopsy report was yet to be given, Dev's younger brother, Kunal, approached the cops on July 16 and expressed suspicion over the causes of his brother's death citing the Instagram chats between Rahul and Sushmita. Police dug deeper and found inconsistencies in Sushmita's statements. The two were arrested early on Saturday.The woman told cops that her husband had slapped and abused her a day before Karwachauth and also often demanded money from her, angering her.

Mumbai Train Blasts 2006: Bombay HC acquits all 12 accused; says prosecution utterly failed to prove case against them,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/2006-mumbai-train-blasts-bombay-hc-acquits-all-12-accused-says-prosecution-utterly-failed-to-prove-case-against-them/articleshow/122806160.cms,"'Prosecution failed to establish type of bomb used'

Here's what court observed:

Very abnormal that witnesses could identify accused after four years

Prosecution evidence not safe to base evidence

Some witnesses were stock witness

Witness who “saw” bombs being assembled remained silent for 100 days, originally a suspect. Changed statement.





MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday refused to confirm the death sentence for five convicted in the 2006 July 11 synchronised Mumbai train blasts and acquitted all 12 accused who had been convicted in September 2015 by a special MCOCA trial court.The HC set aside the September 30, 2015 judgment of the special MCOCA court, finding no evidence to uphold the guilty verdict.The HC held that the prosecution failed to establish its case against all the accused. The prosecution failed to say what kind of explosive was used, its confession statements failed the test of validity, accepted defence arguments of torture before alleged confessions and the HC also discarded the identification parade, for want of proper authority, as well as deposition of witnesses who identified the accused during trial as lacking credibility.The trial court had sentenced seven to life.On Jan 31 this year, after almost seven months of hearing appeals and confirmation references, a special HC bench of Justices Anil Kilor and S.M. Chandak had reserved judgment on the fate of five individuals sentenced to death by a special trial court in 2015 for the synchronised train bombings of July 11, 2006, in Mumbai, along with seven other convicts.In criminal law, a death sentence given by a trial court needs to be first confirmed by the higher court to be an executable sentence.The trial court verdict, while granting the death penalty to five of the convicts, stated, ""It was mindless, cold-blooded, and wanton killings of innocent, defenceless, and unsuspecting persons. The SPP has rightly described the accused as 'Merchants of death.'""Raja Thakare, the Special Public Prosecutor, had argued that the case stands strong, the trial court verdict cannot be dislodged, and death sentences should be confirmed.The prosecution stated that bombs were planted in pairs of one local man and one Pakistani accused.The conviction relied primarily on the confessions of the accused to nail them. The defence counsel before the High Court argued at length, stating the data and confessions of 11—recorded only after the stringent MCOCA Act was invoked to enable the use of such confessions—were ""inadmissible evidence,"" being ""products of torture, fabrication, violation of due process, and falsehood."" Chaudhri argued that ""within a few days of the recording of their confessions, all the accused complained of coercion and torture. ""The defence had argued that confessions were “not genuine’’ and their contention was backed by the fact that accused Mohd Faisal Shaikh, the alleged mastermind of the offence, and four planters given the capital punishment by the trial court were silent on who planted the bomb in the Mahim and Bandra blasts.The HC found merit in the defence contentions.The case is better known as the 7/11 train blasts case. The RDX explosives killed 189 and injured 827 others, according to the trial court verdict.Bombs planted on trains exploded during the peak evening office rush hour at seven locations between Khar Road and Santacruz, Bandra and Khar Road, Jogeshwari and Mahim Junction, Mira Road and Bhayander, Matunga and Mahim Junction, and Borivli.The convicts joined via videoconferencing from prisons across the state, including Pune’s Yerwada and prisons in Nashik, Amravati, and Nagpur.One of them, Naved Hussain Khan, sentenced to death by the special trial court for being a bomb planter, had during the HC hearings spoken for himself from the Nagpur Central Prison when the bench gave them an opportunity.He said that he was ""not involved in this case"" and ""did not even know these other people except"" one prior to the arrests. He said he suffered for 19 years needlessly and, while people lost their lives, innocents can't be hanged either.The special MCOCA trial court Judge Y.D. Shinde had found all 11 confession statements voluntary and none exculpatory.Thakare, who conducted the trial as SPP and had sought the noose for eight of the 12 finally convicted, also argued the confirmation case for the state before the HC.Assisted by advocate Siddharth Jagushte, Thakare had argued that the prosecution evidence presented before the court was cogent then and now.For the 12 men, the defence team included advocate Yug Chaudhri, Payoshi Roy, and senior advocates S. Nagamuthu, Nitya Ramakrishnan, S. Muralidharan, apart from advocates Gaurav Bhawnani, Hetali Sheth, Khan Ishrat, and Aditya Mehta.The lawyers representing the convicts argued that their “extra-judicial confessional statements” obtained by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) through “torture” were inadmissible under the law.They also argued that the accused were falsely implicated, innocent and were languishing in jail for 18 years without substantial evidence, and their prime years were gone in incarceration.The appellants said that the trial court erred in convicting them and therefore the said order be set aside.The convicts Kamal Ansari from Bihar, Mohammad Faisal Ataur Rahman Shaikh from Mumbai, Ehtesham Qutubuddin Siddiqui from Thane, Naveed Hussain Khan from Secunderabad, and Asif Khan from Jalgaon in Maharashtra were found guilty of planting the bombs and sentenced to death by the trial court.Ansari, one of the convicts on death row, died due to Covid-19 in Nagpur prison in 2021.Those awarded life term were Tanveer Ahmed Mohammed Ibrahim Ansari, Mohammed Majid Mohammed Shafi, Shaikh Mohammed Ali Alam Shaikh, Mohammed Sajid Margub Ansari, Muzammil Ataur Rahman Shaikh, Suhail Mehmood Shaikh, and Zameer Ahmed Latiur Rehman Shaikh.One of the accused, Wahid Shaikh, was acquitted by the trial court after nine years in jail.The Maharashtra government in 2015 approached the HC with pleas seeking confirmation of the death penalty granted to five convicts. On the other hand, the convicts filed appeals challenging the special court order.In July 2024, the HC had constituted the special bench in the matter after convicts sought an expedited hearing.After the pronouncement, Yug Chaudhry, Nitya Ramakrishnan, lawyers for the accused—This judgment will go a long way in restoring the faith of people in the judiciary, as it shows that 11 persons can be held to be innocent and acquitted in face of strongest opposition by the prosecution.On videoconference, Sr advocates S. Nagamuthu, S. Muralidhar for the accused: We express our gratitude for patient hearing.Special Public Prosecutor Raja Thakare: We are grateful for ample opportunity. We have learnt a lot. This judgment will be landmark and a guiding torch for all.","The Bombay high court refused to confirm the death sentence for five convicted in the 2006 July 11 synchronised Mumbai train blasts.

Efforts on to defuse tensions





ROHTAK: A panchayat held in Patuwas village in Haryana's Charkhi Dadri district on Sunday directed that an interfaith marriage couple be separated and declared a social boycott of the Muslim man's family across three villages.The four-hour meeting, attended by residents of Patuwas, Mahraana, and Kheri Sanwal villages, was convened over tensions sparked by the marriage of Shahid, a Muslim man, and Preeti, a Hindu woman, both from the district.Village heads Kapoor Singh and Dharampal, who presided over the gathering, said Shahid would not be allowed to return. ""His grandfather has agreed that Shahid will not come back to the village,"" said Dharampal. The panchayat further ruled out any social ties with Shahid's family. The village heads also stated that the couple would be separated.Dharampal said, “The separation process is already under way.” The controversy erupted on July 3, when Shahid and Preeti were married through a nikah (Islamic marriage ceremony). Protests broke out on July 6 after villagers learned of the union, leading to the forced closure of shops owned by Muslims in the area.Police deployed personnel to Shahid’s family home to maintain peace, and security remains in place. Efforts to defuse tensions have been ongoing, with local leaders working under village head Dharampal to mediate the issue.Both had signed affidavits agreeing to live separately and were released from a govt-run safe house to their families. However, dissatisfaction persisted among some village youth, prompting the Sunday’s panchayat.","A panchayat held in Patuwas village in Haryana's Charkhi Dadri district on Sunday directed that an interfaith marriage couple be separated.

Royal reaction and wider probe



Not the first scandal







Thailand’s Buddhist clergy is facing a major crisis after a sex and extortion scandal involving at least 11 monks came to light this week.The monks are accused of breaking their celibacy vows and using temple donations to pay hush money to a woman who blackmailed them.Police say the woman seduced the monks, secretly recorded their sexual acts, and then demanded millions to stay quiet. The scandal involves nearly $12 million in temple funds and is the money donated by worshippers hoping to earn spiritual merit.The case has shocked many Thais, as Buddhism plays a central role in the country’s culture. “I used to respect the monks,” said Mongkol Sudathip, a 33-year-old motorbike taxi driver. “But not anymore.”King Maha Vajiralongkorn cancelled the attendance of over 80 monks at his upcoming birthday event, calling their behaviour “inappropriate” and damaging to public trust. The National Office of Buddhism said all monks involved have been defrocked, and a full police investigation is now underway.Police chief Kitrat Panphet claimed that the scandal does not represent the whole religion, only a few individuals who broke the rules.A new task force is being formed to look deeper into misconduct within temples.In an interview, the woman at the centre of the scandal admitted she spent up to $90,000 a day while going on luxury shopping trips with monks. Monks in Thailand are supposed to live simply on alms and a monthly stipend of about $170. However, many earn extra money by performing blessings and religious ceremonies, blurring the line between religious duty and personal wealth.“I now donate to hospitals and schools,” said Mongkol. “It feels more meaningful than giving to temples.”This isn’t the first time the monkhood has faced criticism. In 2017, a former abbot was arrested for laundering $33 million. Earlier this year, another monk was accused of embezzling nearly $10 million to fund gambling.Experts say public trust is wearing thin. Scholar Danai Preechapermprasit said, “People are beginning to question where their donations go.”Despite growing doubt, many still separate their belief in Buddhism from the actions of individual monks. “You can lose trust in monks,” said Camphun Parimiphut, a 52-year-old security guard. “But the teachings still guide us.”","Monks accused of using temple donations to pay hush money to a woman who blackmailed them.

JAKARTA: Three people died and more than 500 others were rescued after a ferry caught fire off the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, emergency officials said Monday.Passengers jumped overboard with lifejackets after the fire broke out on Sunday at the stern of the KM Barcelona 5, as it sailed to Manado, according to the Indonesian coast guard.A video released by the Manado rescue agency showed a coast guard vessel spraying water on the ferry, which was emitting black smoke.Indonesian authorities previously reported five people died in the accident, but later revised the death toll to three.""Until now, the joint rescue team is still conducting the search and rescue operation because the data is still developing,"" Manado rescue agency head George Leo Mercy Randang told AFP on Monday.""Our post is still open 24 hours a day, in case families want to report about their missing relative.""At least 568 people were rescued from the ferry and water while three others were found dead, the national search and rescue agency said in a statement Monday.The ferry's log had only registered 280 passengers and 15 crew on board.Local media reported that the ship had a capacity for 600 people.Marine accidents are a regular occurrence in the Southeast Asian archipelago of around 17,000 islands, in part due to lax safety standards or bad weather.Sunday's fire came just weeks after another ferry sank off the popular resort island of Bali due to bad weather, killing at least 19 people.In March, a boat carrying 16 people capsized in rough waters off Bali, killing an Australian woman and injuring at least one other person.And in 2018, more than 150 people drowned when a ferry sank in one of the world's deepest lakes on Sumatra Island.","Fire broke out on Sunday at the stern of the KM Barcelona 5, as it sailed to Manado.

Trump tariffs





TOKYO: Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba was clinging on Monday even after his coalition disastrously lost its upper house majority, as painful new US tariffs loom.The Liberal democratic party (LDP), which has governed almost continuously since 1955, and its partner Komeito had to win 50 seats in Sunday's election but they fell three short, national broadcaster NHK reported.Voters angry at inflation turned to other parties, notably the ""Japanese first"" Sanseito, which made strong gains with its ""anti-globalist"" drive echoing the agenda of populist parties elsewhere.""I even think (the LDP) should have lost more,"" 25-year-old Kazuyo Nanasawa, who voted for a small ultra-conservative party, told AFP, adding that Ishiba should quit.The debacle comes only months after Ishiba's coalition was forced into a minority government in the more powerful lower house, in the LDP's worst result in 15 years.But asked late Sunday if he intended to remain in office, Ishiba told local media: ""That's right.""""The deadline of (US) tariffs is coming on August 1. Until then we have to do our best with our body and soul,"" he said.If Ishiba does go, it was unclear who might step up to replace him now that the government needs opposition support in both chambers to pass legislation.LDP supporter Takeshi Nemoto, 80, told AFP that a new leadership contest ""would be a losing battle"" for the party, further complicating tariff talks with US President Donald Trump's administration.""Diplomacy is under pressure at the moment,"" agreed Shuhei Aono, 67. ""Who is going to take care of it? I think (Ishiba) cannot easily withdraw.""The election saw 125 seats in the 248-seat upper house contested.The coalition needed 50 of those but local media reported they only won 47, with the LDP winning 39 and Komeito eight, giving them 122 deputies.Second-placed was the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP), which won 22 contested seats, followed by the Democratic Party For the People (DPP) with 17.The right-wing Sanseito party won 14 seats.Sanseito wants ""stricter rules and limits"" on immigration, opposes ""radical"" gender policies, and wants a rethink on decarbonisation and vaccines.It was forced last week to deny any links to Moscow -- which has backed populist parties elsewhere -- after a candidate was interviewed by Russian state media.The opposition is fragmented, and chances are slim that the parties can form an alternative government, Hidehiro Yamamoto, politics and sociology professor at the University of Tsukuba, told AFP.Expanding the coalition would be difficult, with the DPP the most likely partner ""on the condition that (the government) delivers some of the positive fiscal measures, such as tax cuts,"" he said.More likely is that Ishiba will continue needing opposition support on a case-by-case basis to pass legislation.In return the opposition could press for consumption tax to be cut or abolished, something which Ishiba has opposed in view of Japan's colossal national debts of over 200 percent of gross domestic product.After years of stagnant or falling prices, consumers in the world's fourth-largest economy have been squeezed by inflation since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.In particular, the price of rice has doubled, squeezing many household budgets despite government handouts.Not helping is lingering resentment about an LDP funding scandal, and US tariffs of 25 percent due to bite from August 1 if there is no trade deal with the United States.Japanese imports are already subject to a 10 percent tariff, while the auto industry, which accounts for eight percent of jobs, is reeling from a 25 percent levy.Despite Ishiba securing an early meeting with Trump in February, there has been no trade accord. On Monday tariffs envoy Ryosei Akazawa left on his eighth visit to Washington.""There's no impact from the election result (on the negotiations),"" Akazawa told reporters at Tokyo's Haneda airport, saying that Japan's national interest remained the ""top priority.""","Japanese PM Shigeru Ishiba clinging to office after coalition loses majority in upper house.

Trump’s Body Raising Red Flags? FIFA World Cup Photos Reveal POTUS’ ‘DISTURBING’ Condition





The White House Thursday announced that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with a chronic but benign vein condition amid ongoing speculations over his bruised hand . The White House said the president sought a medical examination for swollen legs which came up with the new finding.""I know that many in the media have been speculating about bruising on the president's hand and also swelling in the president's legs. In the effort of transparency, the president wanted me to share a note from his physician ... all results were within normal limits,"" White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.""Recent photos of the president have shown minor bruising on the back of his hand. This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent hand-shaking and the use of aspirin,"" Leavitt said. Leavitt said Trump decided to share the note on his new health diagnosis with everyone. The president underwent a thorough evaluation after noticing swelling in his lower leg. The condition is benign and common among individuals over the age of 70. Leavitt announced that there is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease.Explaining the bruises on Trump's back of hand, Karoline explained that this is because of minor soft tissue irritation due to frequent hand shaking and the use of aspirin which Trump takes as part of standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.The clarification from the White House came as a close-up of Trump's hand became the center of online chatter as his hand looked evidently bruised. The theory of handshaking was floated earlier too but it was dismissed by many experts.Dr Neal H Patel, a doctor at Providence St Joseph Hospital, told the Daily Mail earlier this year that shaking hands is unlikely to have caused the damage. “I see a lot of patients who are businessmen, and I’ve never really seen them getting bruising from too much handshaking,” he said. “I guess it’s possible, but that would really not be on my list of ideas of what causes it.”",The White House said the president sought a medical examination for swollen legs which came up with the new finding.
