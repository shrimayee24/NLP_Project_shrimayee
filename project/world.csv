Uniform Civil Code can be prepared in 2 days: Ambedkar in 1951,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uniform-civil-code-can-be-prepared-in-2-days-ambedkar-in-1951/articleshow/112580118.cms,"No political party in power took this short step despite SC goading

NEW DELHI: When the Constitution was just a year-old, law minister B R Ambedkar had stoically met the charge that the Hindu Code Bill , 1951, was communal in nature as it aimed to codify the personal law of one religious community leaving aside the Muslims, Parsis, Jews and Christians.On Feb 6, 1951, the architect of the Constitution had countered the members of Parliament who had sought a Uniform Civil Code by saying, “If they want a Civil Code, do they think that it will take very long to have a Civil Code?” He probably had in mind the mandate of Article 44 , which said - “The State shall endeavour to secure for citizens a uniform civil code…”.Ambedkar had said, “Probably the underlying motive why they have made this suggestion is this. As it has taken four or five years to draft the Hindu Code they will probably take ten years to draft a Civil Code. I would like to tell them that the Civil Code is there. If they want it, it can be placed before the House within two days. If they are ready and willing to swallow it, we can pass it in this House in half an hour.” He said by carrying out minor amendments to Indian Succession Act, 1925, and the Special Marriage Act, 1872, “you can have a Civil Code tomorrow”.Ambedkar resigned as law minister in October 1951. Codification of Hindu personal law was done in 1956, preceded by heated debate in Parliament. ‘ Muslim community is not ready for UCC’ argument came from noted lawyer and Muslim League member from West Bengal, Naziruddin Ahmad. Many Hindu MPs opposed the Hindu Code Bill, 1955, and asked why similar simultaneous exercise is not undertaken for Muslims and Christians.Secularistic conservatism towards reforming Muslim personal laws made PM Jawaharlal Nehru adopt Naziruddin Ahmed’s excuse - “The Muslim Community is not ready”. Ridiculing Nehru, MP J B Kriplani said, ”It is not the (Hindu) Mahasabhites who alone are communal; it is the government also that is communal, whatever it may say. It is passing a communal measure. I charge you with communalism because you are bringing forward a law about monogamy only for Hindu community. Take it from me that the Muslim community is prepared to have it but you are not brave enough to do it… If you want to have (provision of divorce) for Hindu community, have it; but have it for the Catholic community also.”It took the Supreme Court 30 years to notice political prevarication on implementation of Article 44. In the 1995 Shah Bano case, the SC said, ""It is also a matter of regret that Article 44 of our Constitution has remained a dead letter… A common civil code will help the cause of national integration by removing disparate loyalties to laws which have conflicting ideologies. No community is likely to bell the cat by making gratuitous concessions on this issue. It is the State which is charged with the duty of securing a uniform civil code for the citizens of the country.""The SC in Sarla Mudgal case (1995) said, “When more than 80% of the citizens have already been brought under the codified personal law, there is no justification whatsoever to keep in abeyance, any more, the introduction of 'uniform civil code' for all citizens in the territory of India.”In the Lily Thomas case [2000 (6) SCC 224], SC noted that the government, in two affidavits of August and December 1996, had said it would take steps to frame a uniform code only if the communities which desired such a code approached the government and took the initiative themselves in the matter. It was a refined version of the ‘Muslim community not ready’ argument of 1955.Today, when every legislative reform - citizenship, agriculture, illegal migration - is opposed with agitation on communal lines, the PM has a difficult task to bring in a uniform civil code. Renaming it as secular civil code will not change ground realities.","Law minister B R Ambedkar had stoically met the charge that the Hindu Code Bill, 1951, was communal in nature.

Who is Sanjay Roy?

Roy joined Kolkata Police’s Disaster Management Group as a civic volunteer in 2019 but used “the right channels” to shift to Kolkata Police’s Welfare Cell.

He reportedly used “connections” to live on the premises of KP’s 4th Battalion. This association helped him get posted at RG Kar Hospital.

What are his position and entitlements?

It has come to light that Roy is a member of the Police Welfare Board’s 14-member central committee, and his 'disapproval' could lead to the transfer of police officers.

Roy received 5 liters of free fuel daily to use a police motorcycle for personal purposes. The motorcycle, which had a police sticker, was seized on Monday.

The bike Sanjay Roy used to ride had a police sticker on it

What are the allegations against him?

A police inquiry into Sanjay Roy has uncovered multiple allegations against him, including extortion, intimidation, and threats against women.

He was found guilty on at least two occasions—first for assaulting his pregnant wife in 2022, and later for misbehaving with a female doctor a few weeks ago—but he was never censured. He managed to evade capture even after assaulting his pregnant wife.

On Monday, a woman went to Lalbazar to report that Roy had been harassing her by phone for the past three months. He first approached her at RG Kar Hospital under the pretext of buying medicine, obtained her number from the prescription, and has since pressured and threatened her to meet.

Another complaint against Roy concerns police transfers. An officer suspects that his significant “influence” may have played an active role in at least six transfers from the Tala police station and Shyambazar police outpost in recent weeks.

CCTV footage captured Roy entering the emergency building at 4am wearing a bluetooth device around his neck. When he left the building 40 minutes later, the earphone was no longer visible. The device was later found to be paired with his cellphone.

What happened at RG Kar on Friday?

Post-midnight, deceased doctor and four colleagues ordered food and had dinner in the seminar room while watching Neeraj Chopra win silver.

After the meal, her colleagues departed, and she remained in the room to continue her studies. She handed over her duties to colleagues, and went to the seminar hall to study. At around 2 am, someone from the hospital visited her in the seminar hall to discuss a patient’s treatment.

Police said that around the same time, she had received a message from her cousin and replied at 2.35 am, saying everything was ""normal"" till then. Before 3 am, a hospital staff member found her lying under a red blanket in the seminar hall. It is assumed that the accused, Sanjay, entered the seminar hall after that.

At 3am, she was seen sleeping in the room.

Around 4am, the accused entered the seminar room, sexually assaulted her. When she attempted to resist, the perpetrator throttled her.

The woman's broken glasses were found next to her laptop, suggesting that she fought her attacker for a considerable time, trying to defend herself.

Her eyes had blood clots from being throttled. Reports indicate that the accused covered her mouth forcefully and slammed her head against the wall, causing injuries to her face. While her thyroid cartilage was not fractured, it did have a blood clot, suggesting the attacker pressed hard to prevent her from escaping. Nail marks on her face indicate she tried to scream but was silenced.

The next morning, when her body was found at 7.30am, her mask was discovered a short distance away. A closed laptop was found near her head, with a diary and her mobile phone placed on top of it. A plastic water bottle was found overturned next to her head.

What is the sequence of events?

1.00 pm: The victim’s parents arrive, and a forensic team examines the seminar room, the crime scene. The parents claim they are initially denied access.

1.10 pm: The parents are granted access to the seminar room. Students identify the body, and a cloth partition is put up.

3.55 pm: The victim’s father requests an inquest by a judicial magistrate.

4.20 pm: The judicial magistrate arrives, conducts a videographed inquest, and the woman’s mother signs the inquest report.

5.30 pm: The body is taken out for an autopsy.

6.10 pm to 7.10 pm: The autopsy is completed.

What does the autopsy say?

The official postmortem report late on Friday also confirmed sexual assault on the 31-year-old doctor.

on the 31-year-old doctor. The report said there were multiple signs of injuries and struggle on the body.

There were blood stains on the face, eyes and face, scratch marks on various parts of the body and bleeding from the private parts.

There were injuries on the lips, abdomen, right hand and fingers while a collar bone was broken.

The report said the death was due to smothering and throttling.

Prima facie, death has been due to gagging and there were multiple signs of injuries and struggle on the body.

The mouth and throat were constantly pressed to prevent screaming. The throat was strangled to suffocate. The thyroid cartilage broke due to this strangulation.

There are aberration marks and bruise marks on the victim’s face, on the eyes till the neck.

The scratch marks on the woman's face, likely caused by the accused's fingernails, suggest that she desperately tried to fight back.

The report mentions that the accused “got certain advantage as the victim was in deep sleep at the time of the attack.”

She had tried to resist, and there were deep mark injuries and scratches on the hands of the accused as well.

The report, however, said that there have been no fracture or breakage of the collar bone or pelvis as reported earlier in the initial phase of observation.

What are preliminary forensic findings?

The scratch mark injuries on Sanjay’s body matched with the skin and blood samples collected from the nails of the victim.

Fact check: What do the claims and police responses reveal about the case?

A source from the Kolkata Police revealed that a claim circulating involves semen from three individuals being found on the doctor’s body. However, a police officer said, “It is impossible to distinguish semen from three individuals with the naked eye during an autopsy.” Medical science defines what an adult male is capable of, and what is being circulated is scientifically impossible, source added.

The second claim circulating on social media is that the woman’s collarbone and pelvic guard were broken. However, police say that based on the autopsy report, she did not have any broken bones.

The third claim is that the Kolkata Police informed the family about a possible suicide, but police say the family confirmed the call did not come from them.

Fourthly, there is a rumor that a police officer offered a large sum of money to silence the murdered doctor’s father. However, the police clarified that, following the Nirbhaya case, the state is required to provide financial compensation to the families of victims of murder, acid attacks, rape, and molestation.

NEW DELHI: A Kolkata Police civic volunteer, Sanjay Roy , was taken into custody on Saturday in connection with the brutal rape and murder of a second-year postgraduate trainee doctor at RG Kar Hospital . The arrest came just six hours after a seven-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed to investigate the case. The SIT had brought the 33-year-old suspect in for questioning late Friday night.","Police inquiry into Sanjay Roy has uncovered multiple allegations against him, including extortion, intimidation, and threats against women. CCTV footage captured Roy entering the emergency building at 4am wearing a bluetooth device around his neck. When he left the building 40 minutes later, the earphone was no longer visible. The device was later found to be paired with his cellphone.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112440947,imgsize-36040,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/112440947.jpg"

Harris accepted the ABC and CBS invitations but declined the Fox News debate.Complicating matters, Vance suggested holding two vice presidential debates, with one overlapping with Trump’s hush-money trial sentencing.The Trump campaign suggests that Democrats are trying to avoid committing to the October debate until they see Harris’s performance in September. Leavitt hinted that Trump might use Harris’s connection to ABC executive Dana Walden as a reason to skip the September debate.With both sides accusing each other of dodging debates, the situation remains uncertain, and the final debate schedule is still up in the air.","Kamala Harris's campaign claimed that Donald Trump's team agreed to three debates: two presidential and one vice presidential.

The dead sea serpent was found floating near La Jolla Cove in San Diego by a group of kayakers and snorkelers over the weekend, marking only the 20th sighting of its kind in California in nearly 125 years.According to the Ocean Conservancy, the oarfish is commonly referred to as the ""doomsday fish"" because it is often sighted during times of disaster.The unusual find was reported by Lauren Fimbres Wood, spokesperson for the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, as per reports by the US Today. She detailed how a team of scientists and lifeguards worked to transport the oarfish to a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) facility for examination.Ben Frable, an ichthyologist at Scripps, highlighted the rarity of the event. “Finding an oarfish is incredibly rare,” he said, underscoring the significance of the discovery as only 20 oarfish have washed up in the state since 1901. A necropsy was underway on Friday to determine the cause of death of this mysterious deep-sea inhabitant.The oarfish’s appearance has stirred echoes of Japanese folklore, where the fish is believed to be an omen of impending disaster. Known as ""ryugu no tsukai"" or ""messenger from the sea god’s palace,"" these fish were thought to warn of earthquakes. This belief, which dates back to 17th century Japan, has been fueled by sightings of oarfish before major earthquakes, such as the 2011 Tohoku quake and Fukushima disaster.However, Hiroyuki Motomura, a professor of ichthyology at Kagoshima University, casts doubt on a direct connection between the fish’s appearance and seismic activity. “I believe these fish tend to rise to the surface when their physical condition deteriorates,” Motomura explained as reported by the US Today. “The connection might be more about their health and less about impending earthquakes.”Oarfish typically inhabit deep-sea environments, residing between 700 and 3,280 feet below the surface. Their rare appearances near the surface often occur when they are in poor health, making such sightings all the more unusual.The oarfish found in California will be preserved for further study and added to the Scripps Marine Vertebrate Collection, one of the largest collections of deep-sea fish globally. “Each specimen offers a unique chance to learn more about these enigmatic creatures,” said Fimbres Wood.As scientists continue to study the oarfish, the blend of myth and science surrounding its appearance remains a captivating aspect of marine lore and research.","The dead sea serpent was found floating near La Jolla Cove in San Diego by a group of kayakers and snorkelers over the weekend.

Secret Service pulls from Biden's protective team to guard Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/secret-service-pulls-from-bidens-protective-team-to-guard-trump/articleshow/112579985.cms,"The Secret Service has bolstered former President Donald Trump 's security in a variety of ways since the assassination attempt on him last month, several people familiar with the matter said Thursday, including by temporarily shifting part of President Joe Biden 's protective team to Trump.The Secret Service has also secured ballistic glass, which is designed to repel bullets, to provide enhanced protection for Trump at future outdoor campaign rallies, those people added, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential methods.The reassignment of members of a president's team to a candidate is unusual, said a Secret Service official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential policy matters. But the increased threat of violence against Trump, combined with Biden's recent reduced travel schedule, made the step both necessary and feasible, the official added.A White House spokesperson had no immediate comment, and a Trump campaign spokesperson declined to comment.The Secret Service has been under a cloud since July 13, when an assailant was able to fire, unimpeded, on Trump at an outdoor campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The attack grazed Trump's ear, killed a spectator and seriously wounded two others. The FBI is investigating, and congressional leaders have also opened inquiries.The Secret Service has taken responsibility for the security lapses that made the shooting possible. Kimberly A. Cheatle resigned as the agency's director and has been replaced. Cheatle, who has received threats since the Butler rally, is now under Secret Service protection herself, according to an agency official, who added that at least two other Secret Service employees have needed official protection as well.But even as it reels from its worst presidential security breach in more than four decades, the agency has had to continue its mission of protecting three dozen current and former officials, and their families, through what is proving to be a challenging and intense presidential campaign year.Secret Service methodology ""is made to be flexible,"" said Donald Mihalek, who worked for the agency for two decades before retiring in 2019, ""and to address known, and unknown, threats. The steps the Secret Service is taking are a natural part of its asymmetrical approach to assure their no-fail mission is fulfilled.""Mihalek, who helped protect several presidents during his years in the service, said that he had occasionally seen members of a president's team reassigned to other jobs for periods of time, especially during United Nations events.The agency's presidential protective division, as the group is known, is used for high-level protective details because of its experience and expertise, he said.The division consists of hundreds of Secret Service employees who fan out across the White House compound to fulfill various security roles and also travel with the president, according to the current service official as well as former agents. Because Biden has traveled relatively little since dropping his reelection bid on July 21, division members who would typically travel and do advance work are now available to work with Trump's team, the official said.It is rare -- though not unheard-of -- to use ballistic glass for those being protected other than the sitting president and vice president, partly because the material is heavy to move, current and former Secret Service officials said. The glass is usually transported by military planes, these people said, easing the logistical burden on the Secret Service.In the case of Trump, whose potential use of ballistic glass for future campaign events was reported earlier by ABC News, the glass will be positioned at various points around the country for ease of use, a service official said.Trump held an outdoor news conference Thursday at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, but he has not held an outdoor rally since the one in Butler.He has said he would like to return to the Butler area for a future event.""We're going to go back in October,"" he said in an interview with billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk this week.","The Secret Service has reassigned members of a president's team to a candidate.

Which countries have confirmed mpox virus cases?

WHO warns more mpox to come in Europe after case in Sweden

What is mpox? What are its symptoms?

NEW DELHI: Pakistan has confirmed its first mpox (earlier known as monkeypox ) case of the year after a 34-year-old man who recently returned from Saudi Arabia tested positive for the virus, reported ARY News. The individual, a resident of Mardan, arrived in Pakistan on August 3 and began showing symptoms shortly after reaching Peshawar.The diagnosis was confirmed by Khyber Medical University in Peshawar, and the positive result was verified on August 13, marking the first report of monkeypox in Pakistan for 2024.Health officials have begun contact tracing efforts to identify and monitor individuals who were in close contact with the patient, including fellow passengers on his flight from Saudi Arabia.Earlier in 2023, three passengers were diagnosed with monkeypox at Karachi's Jinnah International Airport. All three were Pakistani citizens aged between 30 and 45. The passengers were admitted to the infectious disease hospital.China will monitor individuals and goods entering the country for mpox over the next six months, according to a statement from its customs administration issued on Friday.Last year, China announced that mpox would be managed as a Category B infectious disease. This designation allows officials to take emergency measures such as restricting gatherings, suspending work and school, or sealing off areas during an outbreak.Category B infectious diseases in China currently include Covid-19, AIDS, and SARS.The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths from mpox have been recorded in Africa this year, surpassing last year's figures. More than 96% of these cases and deaths have occurred in Congo, where a new, potentially more transmissible variant is causing concern among scientists.Sweden's public health agency announced on Thursday that the new mpox variant has been identified in a person who recently traveled to Africa and sought healthcare upon returning to Stockholm.WHO warned further imported cases of the new, more dangerous mpox strain in Europe were likely, after Sweden announced the first such infection outside Africa in an outbreak that has killed hundreds in the DR Congo.The WHO's European regional office in Copenhagen said it was discussing with Sweden how best to manage the newly detected case. ""The confirmation of mpox Clade 1 in Sweden is a clear reflection of the interconnectedness of our world,"" it said in a statement.""There are likely to be further imported cases of Clade 1 in the European region over the coming days and weeks, and it is imperative that we don't stigmatise travellers or countries/regions. Travel restrictions and border closures don't work and should be avoided,"" it added.Mpox, also known as monkeypox, first identified in 1958 in monkeys, has recently spread to over 70 countries. The virus, which is similar to smallpox but milder, has caused outbreaks globally since it was confirmed to spread via sex in 2022.Initially, mpox was mostly seen in central and West Africa among people in close contact with infected animals. However, the 2022 outbreaks marked a significant shift, making it a global concern.Mpox belongs to the same family of viruses as smallpox. It causes milder symptoms such as fever, chills, and body aches. In more serious cases, people can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest, and genitals.",Pakistan has confirmed its first mpox case of the year.

Why Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is worried about assassination,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/why-saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-is-worried-about-assassination/articleshow/112557445.cms,"Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman reportedly said that he fears being assassinated if he moves ahead with the normalisation agreement with Israel without securing concessions for Palestinians.According to a Politico report published on Wednesday, the crown prince asked what the US had done to protect Egyptian President Anwar Sadat , who was killed by Islamist militants in 1981, after the landmark peace deal and emphasised that the necessity of incorporating a clear path to a Palestinian state in any potential normalisation deal.While talking with the US Congress members, Bin Salman, commonly referred to as MBS, indicated that despite he fears that pursuing a grand bargain with the US and Israel will cost him life still intends to move ahead with forging ties with the Jewish state.The specifics of the largely confidential and evolving agreement have surfaced through various sources, including my own reporting. The United States is making several pledges to Saudi Arabia, such as security assurances through a treaty, assistance with a civilian nuclear program, and investments in sectors like technology.Some reports suggest that in return, Saudi Arabia would restrict its interactions with China. Additionally, the kingdom would establish diplomatic and other relations with Israel, which would be a significant advantage for the Israelis, considering Saudi Arabia's prominence in the Muslim world.However, much to MBS' disappointment, the Israeli government has been reluctant to incorporate a viable pathway to Palestinian statehood within the agreement.""The way he put it was, 'Saudis care very deeply about this, and the street throughout the Middle East cares deeply about this, and my tenure as the keeper of the holy sites of Islam will not be secure if I don't address what is the most pressing issue of justice in our region,'"" said one of the people with knowledge of conversations MBS has had with regional and American leaders.Nevertheless, the report says, MBS “appears intent on striking the mega-deal with the US and Israel,” which he sees “as crucial to his country’s future.”According to a senior foreign affairs correspondent at Politico, Nahal Toosi, the Saudi crown prince has been discussing the possibility of his own assassination. The timing of these conversations remains unclear. However, Toosi suggests that the prince's motive may be to pressure US officials into persuading Israel to agree to a deal that aligns with his interests.Sources within the US Congress have indicated that the likelihood of achieving an Israel-Saudi normalization agreement before the upcoming presidential election in November is extremely low. This is due to the Senate's lack of time to ratify the US-Saudi portion of the deal prior to its recess. The crown prince's discussions about his potential assassination seem to be an attempt to expedite the process and secure a favorable outcome.US President Joe Biden has said Saudi Arabia wants to “fully recognize Israel” in exchange for security guarantees from Washington and the establishment of a civilian nuclear facility.On Monday, the White House confirmed it had resumed offensive weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, lifting a ban enacted in 2021 over human rights concerns. The resumption was seen as part of Washington’s efforts to enlist the help of Riyadh in securing a ceasefire in Gaza and countering a possible Iranian attack on Israel, reported Politico.",Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman reportedly said that he fears being assassinated if he moves ahead with the normalisation agreement with Israel.

Trump assassination attempt: Secret service enhances former president's security by reallocating Biden’s protective team,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-assassination-attempt-secret-service-enhances-former-presidents-security-by-reallocating-bidens-protective-team/articleshow/112579603.cms,"The Secret Service has significantly strengthened former President Donald Trump’s security following the assassination attempt on him last month, sources familiar with the situation revealed on Thursday. This includes temporarily reallocating members of President Joe Biden's protective team to Trump’s detail and securing ballistic glass for use at future outdoor campaign events, reported NYT.The reassignment of presidential protection personnel to a candidate is unusual, according to a Secret Service official who requested anonymity. However, the heightened threat to Trump and Biden’s reduced travel schedule have made this measure both necessary and practical.The Secret Service has faced intense scrutiny since July 13, when an assailant managed to fire at Trump during an outdoor rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The attack grazed Trump’s ear, killed a spectator, and injured two others. The FBI and congressional leaders are investigating the incident.Following the breach, former Secret Service Director Kimberly A. Cheatle resigned and has since been placed under Secret Service protection due to threats she has received. The agency has also provided protection to at least two other employees.Despite the ongoing challenges and the high-profile nature of the security breach, the Secret Service remains focused on its mission to protect current and former officials amid a demanding presidential campaign season. Donald Mihalek, a former Secret Service agent, described the agency’s response as part of its “asymmetrical approach” to addressing both known and unknown threats.The use of ballistic glass, though rare for non-sitting presidents, is being implemented for Trump’s events. The glass, which is typically transported by military aircraft due to its weight, will be strategically positioned across the country for Trump’s future rallies.Trump, who has not held an outdoor rally since the Butler event, announced plans to return to the area in October. He confirmed his intent in a recent interview with billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk.A White House spokesperson had no immediate comment, and Trump’s campaign also declined to provide a statement.","The Secret Service has significantly strengthened former President Donald Trump's security following the assassination attempt on him last month.

US Supreme Court stops Biden administration's LGBT rule from taking effect in schools,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-stops-biden-administrations-lgbt-rule-from-taking-effect-in-schools/articleshow/112579395.cms,"The US Supreme Court on Friday declined to allow President Joe Biden 's administration to enforce a significant portion of a new rule aimed at protecting LGBT students from discrimination in schools and colleges based on gender identity . The decision impacts 10 Republican-led states that challenged the rule, marking a setback for the administration's efforts to expand protections under Title IX .The justices denied the administration's request to partially lift lower court injunctions that had blocked the rule, which was set to take effect on August 1. The rule was designed to clarify that discrimination ""on the basis of sex"" under Title IX includes sexual orientation and gender identity. This rule would have extended protections to LGBT students in federally funded education programs.The lawsuits were filed by a coalition of states, including Louisiana, Tennessee, and Kentucky, along with other plaintiffs who argued that the rule would force schools to accommodate transgender students in ways that they claimed could compromise the safety and privacy of other students. The states argued that the rule exceeded federal authority and represented an overreach by the Biden administration.Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill criticized the rule, stating, ""This is all for a political agenda, ignoring significant safety concerns for young women students."" She argued that the rule would compel schools to change their policies regarding restrooms, locker rooms, and pronoun usage, which she deemed ""enormously invasive.""In defense of the rule, US Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine Lhamon said, ""These final regulations clarify Title IX's requirement that schools promptly and effectively address all forms of sex discrimination. We look forward to working with schools, students, and families to prevent and eliminate sex discrimination.""Despite the Supreme Court's refusal to lift the injunctions, the administration maintained that most of the rule's provisions are unrelated to gender identity and should still be allowed to take effect. However, it agreed to keep certain provisions, including those related to restrooms and locker rooms, blocked while the legal battles continue.This legal challenge is part of a broader trend, with similar lawsuits blocking the law in 22 states, mostly governed by Republicans. The court's decision comes ahead of its next term, where it will also hear a case from Tennessee involving a ban on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors.The Biden administration has argued that the rule aligns with the Supreme Court's 2020 decision, which held that a similar law, Title VII, protects gay and transgender employees from workplace discrimination. However, lower courts in Louisiana and Kentucky concluded that Title IX's reference to sex pertains only to ""biological"" males and females, leading to the current legal impasse.",The US Supreme Court declined to allow the administration to enforce a new rule aimed at protecting LGBT students from discrimination.

"Trump says civilian award ‘better’ than military medal for those ‘dead’ or ‘hit’ by bullets, Vance defends comments as ‘reasonable’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-says-civilian-award-better-than-military-medal-for-those-dead-or-hit-by-bullets-draws-criticism/articleshow/112579394.cms,"Former President Donald Trump sparked controversy after describing the Presidential Medal of Freedom as ""much better"" than the Medal of Honor , suggesting that the military award often goes to service members who are severely wounded or deceased. The comments, made at a campaign event at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club, add to a series of remarks from Trump that critics say show disdain for military service members who are wounded, captured, or killed.At the event, which was billed as a discussion on fighting antisemitism, Trump recounted awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Miriam Adelson, the widow of casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and a significant donor to Trump’s campaigns.He contrasted the civilian honor with the Medal of Honor, inaccurately referring to it as the ""Congressional Medal of Honor,"" and claimed the two awards were ""rated equal.""""I have to say Miriam, I watched Sheldon sitting so proud in the White House when we gave Miriam the Presidential Medal of Freedom, that's the highest award you can get as a civilian,"" Trump said during a pro-Israel event. ""It's the equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor, but civilian version — it's actually much better because everyone gets the Congressional Medal of Honor, they're soldiers, they are even in very bad shape because they have been hit so many times by bullets or they are dead.""""She gets it and she's a healthy, beautiful, woman,"" Trump said to some applause. ""They are rated equal.""In response to the backlash, Republican vice-presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance defended Trump’s remarks, emphasizing that they were not intended to demean military honors.""I don't think him complementing and saying a nice word about a person who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom is in any way denigrating those who received military honors,"" Vance told reporters during a campaign stop in Milwaukee. ""They are two different awards. And I think the president was saying some nice things about a person he liked, and that is a totally reasonable thing to do.""Vance, who noted that he had not seen the entirety of Trump’s comments, added that the former president ""loves our veterans.""Brian Hughes, a spokesman for Trump’s campaign, later clarified that Trump's comments referred to the emotional difficulty of awarding the Medal of Honor to veterans who have been wounded or killed in action, emphasizing that Trump had done so proudly as commander in chief.However, the remarks were met with swift criticism. Sarafina Chitika, a spokesperson for Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign, responded sharply, saying, ""Donald Trump knows nothing about service to anyone or anything but himself,"" and urging voters to prevent Trump from becoming commander in chief again.Trump’s comments also risk undermining Republican efforts to challenge Democratic vice-presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota over his military record, potentially complicating their campaign strategy.The controversy adds to a pattern of remarks by Trump that have been perceived as disrespectful to the military, raising questions about his relationship with service members as he seeks to return to the presidency.","Former President Donald Trump sparked controversy after describing the Presidential Medal of Freedom as ""much better"" than the Medal of Honor.

From 'perfect candidate' to sudden exit: Inside the fall of Columbia's President Minouche Shafik,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-perfect-candidate-to-sudden-exit-inside-the-fall-of-columbias-president-minouche-shafik/articleshow/112579352.cms,"'Humanity In All Its Differentiated Glory'

Months of Turmoil

London Calling

A Last Surprise

The part-time role in London was unpaid, temporary and only advisory, but to Minouche Shafik , it offered a way out of her beleaguered presidency at Columbia University .She had arrived in New York only last year for one of academia's plum jobs: running an Ivy League university with enormous riches and diversity, extraordinary prestige and a heritage that predated American independence.To the university's leaders, Shafik was a peerless pick, a globally minded economist with a remarkable personal story, and the first woman to lead Columbia.These last 10 months, though, since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, had been miserable for Columbia and its president. The university, which Shafik had championed as a haven for the world's best minds who could help solve society's intractable problems, disintegrated into factions. And as Shafik's response proved swerving and uneven, she found herself with few allies and facing a campus where she was perceived as insular and rarely seen.By the time summer break arrived, she had been vilified on campus and in Congress as an ally of antisemites, a turncoat to academic freedom and free speech, and an enfeebled leader who had both allowed pro-Palestinian protests to plunge into lawlessness and been too willing to call in police. Her home seemed as much a fortress as a residence. And even as summer brought a respite from encampments and protests, university officials so feared the possibility of future trouble that they began weighing police powers for campus security officers.People who had spoken to Shafik in recent months came to believe that she was deeply unhappy, and she had told faculty members that she thought there was little trust in her administration.Ultimately, she decided to resign from Columbia, accept the British Foreign Office's offer to chair an outside review on development policy and return to her peerage in the House of Lords. The bruising environs of Westminster and Whitehall would be her safe harbor -- away from the grandstanding and protesting of an American political season wrapped up with a grinding war many of her students reviled.In an open letter released Wednesday night, Shafik, who could not be reached for comment, said ruefully that her 13-month tenure had included ""a period of turmoil where it has been difficult to overcome divergent views across our community."" She cited the ""considerable toll"" on her family and said it had been ""distressing -- for the community, for me as president and on a personal level -- to find myself, colleagues and students the subject of threats and abuse.""Her departure from Columbia was abrupt, just weeks after she published a letter that gave no hint that she was considering a retreat. But her resignation , which Columbia's board co-chairs said trustees accepted ""regretfully,"" would almost certainly not close this contentious era in the university's 270-year history, or in higher education in the United States.A congressional investigation is underway, and the blame game for months of turbulence is only beginning. Columbia has interim leadership, and faculty and administrators are bracing for a fall semester of flare-ups that could turn into fodder for the 2024 presidential campaign.""She started with a lot of hope and optimism, and no one foresaw it ending this way,"" said James H. Applegate, a professor of astronomy and a member of a university senate committee whose authority Shafik ignored when she summoned police to campus in April. ""That is a tremendous disappointment.""But, he added, perhaps her decision should not have been all that much of a surprise: ""At some point you have to say, from Shafik's point of view, 'How much longer do you want to put up with this stuff?' It's a toxic hellhole, and it's directed at her.""It was never going to be all that easy to follow Lee C. Bollinger, the free-speech scholar who led Columbia for 21 years. But in January 2023, Columbia's board announced Shafik's appointment with glassy-eyed fanfare. Jonathan Lavine, then the university board's chair, pronounced her as nothing less than ""the perfect candidate: a brilliant and able global leader, a community builder and a preeminent economist who understands the academy and the world beyond it.""An economist who had fled Egypt with her family during childhood, Shafik had been educated in the American South before earning degrees from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the London School of Economics and Oxford University. She was a young star at the World Bank, took a powerful job in Britain's development agency and went on to senior roles at the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England. In 2020, she became a cross-bencher in the House of Lords -- a bona fide baroness.She was not, however, steeped in the byzantine world of university governance in the United States. At Columbia, as at many other universities, presidents are not autonomous rulers but essential figures in a shared power structure.During her formal inauguration Oct. 4, she framed her address around a question: ""What does the world need from a great university in the 21st century?""In an earlier era, she noted, universities ""were kept separate from the world around them.""""Columbia started as a university for white, Christian men,"" she added. ""For most of its history, it would have been inconceivable for someone who looks like me to be president of this great institution. Today, Columbia includes humanity in all its differentiated glory, and our world is so much richer for it.""Three days later, Hamas fighters burst out of the Gaza Strip into Israel.Two days later, Shafik said she was ""devastated by the horrific attack on Israel"" and called on people to ""reject forces that seek to pull us apart.""On Oct. 12, only eight days after her optimistic oration, Columbia closed its campus as hundreds of protesters amassed. It was a way of separating itself, for the moment, from the world around it.Shutting the gates resolved little. Protests were exploding on campuses across the country, and Columbia was grappling with ones that some students felt had especially menacing airs of antisemitism and intimidation.Shafik moved to tighten rules around demonstrations and, in November, the university was among the first to suspend Jewish Voice for Peace and Students for Justice in Palestine, a pair of pro-Palestinian groups that Columbia officials insisted had defied the rules for staging protests. Critics suspected speech suppression.Hundreds of students rallied to oppose the suspensions, and a walkout of hundreds of faculty members followed a day later.For a time, though, Shafik was able to pursue order and soothe donors largely in private. And she avoided the spotlight in December, when the presidents of Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania testified before Congress. Their lawyerly answers to questions about antisemitism helped unravel their tenures within a month. (Shafik was traveling abroad at the time of the hearing.)But pressure was mounting as protests continued and fears of antisemitism surged.Then, on April 17, Shafik took her turn before Congress. Columbia officials had studied the December showdown that had undone the Harvard and Penn leaders, and they settled on a different approach: Shafik would appear empathetic and conciliatory.""Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Columbia's code of conduct?"" Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-Ore., demanded early in the hearing.""Yes, it does,"" Shafik replied, echoing the board co-chairs, Claire Shipman and David J. Greenwald, who had accompanied her to Capitol Hill.Under persistent questioning from Republicans, Shafik went into surprising detail about the disciplining of university employees, which is usually confidential.Congress, for the moment, was at bay. But that morning, students had gone to a grassy quad and pitched tents. They posted a sign: ""Gaza Solidarity Encampment.""Shafik decided to call in police, violating, in the view of many professors, university protocol since members of the university senate had warned her not to.At Columbia, few decisions are as freighted as summoning the New York Police Department. In 1968, police were infamously brought in to quell protests and made more than 700 arrests, a decision that shadowed the university for decades and hamstrung applications and donations alike.Shafik's choice led to more than 100 arrests and propelled Columbia to the center of a national firestorm, turning the campus into a symbol of a springtime protest movement that ultimately led to thousands of arrests across the country.Faculty members began discussing a censure, a humiliating punishment. Shafik, students and professors railed, was stifling speech and threatening the academic freedom that had been sacrosanct for generations.Worse yet for Shafik, the arrests only emboldened many of the demonstrators, who promptly reconstructed their encampment. Rumors swirled that the National Guard would be deployed to the campus, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, with a group of Republican lawmakers, held a news conference at Columbia on the steps of the Low Library. According to Johnson, he stood in Shafik's office and told her to quit.She refused, much like the protesters who were rebuffing demands that they pack up.Then in the early hours of April 30, protesters captured Hamilton Hall, a building that demonstrators had occupied in 1968.Columbia had days earlier said that bringing the NYPD to campus again would be ""counterproductive,"" but Shafik called in police once more. Hundreds of officers marched through the campus that night. The occupation, Shafik said, had left her with ""no choice.""The dozens of arrests satisfied few. Protesters and their allies were furious over the return of the police. Others demanded to know how Shafik had allowed such disorder to reign in the first place.The besieged university, with its gates closed and many students opting for remote classes, staggered to the end of the semester. Columbia canceled its main commencement event, and Shafik stayed away from each of the smaller ceremonies.Summer arrived, dimming the chaos, though Shafik soon found her university putting three deans on leave for text messages that she said ""touched on ancient antisemitic tropes."" (The deans resigned this month. A fourth administrator who was involved in the exchanges to a lesser degree, Josef Sorett, remains at Columbia.)Soon after the ""Textgate"" scandal, as it became known on campus, a resurgent, recalibrated Labour Party in Britain thumped the Conservative Party in a general election. At the Foreign Office, Britain's new top diplomat, David Lammy, ordered a trio of reviews to examine policy.Sometime over the last month or so, the government reached out to Shafik to see whether she would chair an advisory committee on development policy. The role was not conceived as a post-Columbia landing spot for Shafik, according to a British official who, in line with government protocol, spoke on the condition of anonymity.To accept the position, Shafik did not need to step down from Columbia. In fact, the government was recruiting other high-profile outsiders to scrutinize British policy with no expectation that they would vacate other roles.Shafik agreed to the post. And to the surprise of some in London and New York, she decided to quit Columbia, too.Columbia planned to announce Shafik's exit Thursday, but word began to bubble up Wednesday evening. There was little time to warn people of the seismic change, including that the board had selected Dr. Katrina A. Armstrong, the university's executive vice president for health and biomedical sciences, as Columbia's interim leader.A campus consumed by months of tumult found itself stunned anew.""I've had calls since 7 in the morning,"" Costis Maglaras, the dean of the business school, said Thursday. ""I think people are sad to learn that Minouche has stepped down, but people are now facing forward and sort of rallying around Katrina.""But to some on campus, Shafik's eventual collapse had been all but certain since April.Brendan O'Flaherty, a Columbia economics professor, believed that her willingness to discuss disciplining professors by name before Congress ""was her undoing with the faculty.""""For large numbers of faculty, that's a major, major sin, which she did not repent of,"" he said.The university did not say when Columbia would begin a search for a permanent president. And the university senate is planning to have a commission study the events of recent months, much as Columbia did after the 1968 protests.For now, many at Columbia are turning toward the start of classes Sept. 3 and whatever the new semester may bring.Applegate said: ""I won't be surprised if there's an encampment on the first day of classes.""In the meantime, Shafik's critics in Washington, the politicians who insisted that she had caved to chaos, celebrated her exit. So did Students for Justice in Palestine, a group Columbia suspended on her watch.","Minouche Shafik was vilified as an ally of antisemites, a turncoat to academic freedom. She was the first woman to lead Columbia, a prestigious Ivy League university. She resigned from Columbia, accepted an offer to chair an outside review on development policy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112579427,imgsize-221978,width-400,resizemode-4/112579427.jpg"

Israel has characterised its Gaza offensive as targeting Hamas' infrastructure, with the goal of eliminating the entire terror group while minimising civilian casualties.In a joint statement on Monday, US President Joe Biden, along with the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, and Italy, called on Iran to cease its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel.According to the White House, the joint statement read, ""We called on Iran to stand down its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel and discussed the serious consequences for regional security should such an attack take place."" The statement also highlighted the urgent need for the delivery and distribution of aid.""We expressed our full support for ongoing efforts to de-escalate tensions and reach a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza.

Additionally, the unfettered delivery and distribution of aid is needed. We expressed our support for the defence of Israel against Iranian aggression and against attacks by Iran-backed terrorist groups,"" it added.After Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran last month, which prompted promises of ""punishment"" from Iran, Israel is preparing for a strong retaliation.While Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for Haniyeh's death, it had previously threatened to execute him and other senior Hamas figures for their involvement in the October 7 terrorist attacks.Tensions in West Asia escalated after the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) announced on July 31 that Ismail Haniyeh had been killed in an attack in Tehran. The IRGC stated that Haniyeh and one of his bodyguards were killed when their residence in Tehran was hit. A projectile struck a house allocated to war veterans in Tehran at 2 a.m. (local time) on Wednesday, according to a Press TV report.The IDF also announced that top Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr was killed in an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon on July 30, which was in retaliation for the rocket attack on the Golan Heights that killed 12 children. Fuad Shukr, described as the ""most senior Hezbollah military commander,"" was killed in the Israeli strike, the IDF stated. Shukr was a member of the Jihad Council, Hezbollah's top military body, and was considered the head of its strategic division.","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to visit Israel on Saturday, August 17. He will advance efforts towards securing a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.

"Harvard resolves lawsuit alleging professor's harassment, intimidation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harvard-resolves-lawsuit-alleging-professors-harassment-intimidation/articleshow/112576458.cms,"BOSTON: Harvard University and three graduate students have settled a federal lawsuit accusing the Ivy League school of ignoring complaints of sexual harassment by a renowned professor and allowing him to intimidate students by threatening to hinder their careers. The suit filed in Boston in 2022 was dismissed without court costs and with prejudice, according to an order by federal Magistrate Judge Judith Dein dated Thursday, meaning the students can't re-litigate the claims.Terms of the settlement were not made public.The students' lawyers praised their clients' courage ""in coming forward, speaking up about their experiences and shedding light on important issues.""""We are glad that our clients will now be able to move on with their lives and careers,"" the statement from Sanford Heisler Sharp said.The lawsuit alleged that one of the students was subjected to repeated forcible kissing and groping as early as 2017 by John Comaroff, a professor of anthropology and African and African American studies. And when the student met with him to discuss her plans to study in an African country, Comaroff repeatedly said she could be subjected to violence in Africa because she was in a same-sex relationship, the lawsuit said.The other two plaintiffs said Comaroff threatened to derail their careers after they reported his behaviour to university administrators. One accused him of giving her unwanted sexual attention when she was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago.Comaroff, 79, was not named as a defendant, and his lawyers said at the time that he ""categorically denies ever harassing or retaliating against any student"". He ""consistently made every effort to assist these students and to advance their careers,"" their statement said.As for the discussion about the dangers of possible violence in the African country, he said his advice was appropriate, motivated by concern for her safety if she travelled with a same-sex partner - a warning similar to what's published by the US State Department.Comaroff said in a July statement announcing his retirement from Harvard that the lawsuit ""repeated all of the allegations already found to lack merit"" during a Harvard investigation, but ""in more lurid, hyperbolic terms"" to make him a scapegoat in their fight against the university.""All this extraordinary attention, all the furor, all the nastiness, arose out of two brief office-hour discussions, both academic in intent and content,"" Comaroff wrote. ""An ugly, ferocious campaign had been waged against me at Harvard by a small group of activists, people who have no knowledge of me, of my pedagogy, or of the facts of the case as established by Harvard's thorough, largely exonerating investigation.""At the time the lawsuit was filed in 2022, a Harvard spokesperson shared a letter saying Comaroff was put on administrative leave for the rest of that spring semester after university investigators found his verbal conduct violated the school's sexual, gender-based and professional conduct policies.Before the lawsuit went to mediation in November, lawyers for Harvard had argued for a dismissal, saying the statute of limitations had expired for some claims and that others lacked merit.Emails seeking comment on the settlement from attorneys representing Comaroff and the university were not immediately returned Friday.","The suit filed in 2022 was dismissed without court costs and with prejudice.

Election officials keep Green Party presidential candidate on Wisconsin ballot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/election-officials-keep-green-party-presidential-candidate-on-wisconsin-ballot/articleshow/112576360.cms,"MADISON: Wisconsin elections officials dismissed a Democratic National Committee employee's demands Friday to remove the Green Party's presidential candidate from the ballot in the key swing state.DNC employee David Strange filed a complaint with the Wisconsin Elections Commission on Wednesday asking the commission to remove Jill Stein from the presidential ballot .The election commission 's attorney, Angela O'Brien Sharpe, wrote to Strange on Friday saying she had dismissed the complaint because it names commissioners as respondents and they can't ethically decide a matter brought against them.Dismissing the complaint clears the way for a potential lawsuit seeking to keep Stein off the ballot. A spokesperson for the DNC had no immediate comment Friday. The Stein campaign didn't immediately respond to a message sent to their media email inbox.The bipartisan elections commission unanimously approved ballot access for Stein in February because the Green Party won more than 1% of the vote in a statewide race in 2022. Sheryl McFarland got nearly 1.6% of the vote while finishing last in a four-way race for secretary of state.Strange argued in his complaint that the Green Party can't nominate presidential electors in Wisconsin because no one in the party is a state officer, defined as legislators, judges and others. Without any presidential electors, the party can't have a presidential candidate on the ballot, Strange contended.Stein's appearance on the ballot could make a difference in battleground Wisconsin, where four of the past six presidential elections have been decided by between 5,700 votes and about 23,000 votes.Stein last appeared on the Wisconsin ballot 2016, when she won just over 31,000 votes - more than Donald Trump's winning margin in the state. Some Democrats have blamed her for helping Trump win the state and the presidency that year.The Wisconsin Supreme Court kept Green Party presidential candidate Howie Hawkins off the ballot in 2020 after the elections commission deadlocked on whether he filed proper nominating signatures.The latest Marquette University Law School poll conducted July 24 through Aug. 1 showed the presidential contest in Wisconsin between Democrat Kamala Harris and Trump to be about even among likely voters. Democrats fear third-party candidates could siphon votes from Harris and tilt the race toward Trump.The elections commission plans to meet Aug. 27 to determine whether four independent presidential candidates, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West, have met the prerequisites to appear on the ballot.Strange filed a separate complaint last week with the commission seeking to keep West off the ballot, alleging his declaration of candidacy wasn't properly notarized. Cornel's campaign manager countered in a written response any notarization shortcomings shouldn't be enough to keep him off the ballot. That complaint is still pending.Michigan election officials tossed West off that state's ballot Friday over similar notary issues.","DNC employee David Strange filed a complaint with the Wisconsin Elections Commission on Wednesday asking the commission to remove Jill Stein from the presidential ballot.

Alexander A., the president of the Milwaukee Police Association and a 24-year veteran of the Milwaukee Police Department, introduced Vance and expressed the organization's support.""Senator Vance, thank you for being here to amplify our message that our members provide the highest degree of service to our community,"" said Alexander A. ""We like to say that the Milwaukee Police Association is the force behind the force, and we use the words honor and service when we talk about our brave men and women of our department.""Alexander highlighted several challenges faced by the police in Milwaukee, including low bail for dangerous criminals, the need for concerted efforts to apprehend offenders with bench warrants, low officer morale, and societal pressures against police forces. He noted that these issues are exacerbated by staffing shortages, leading to situations where entire areas of the city might be left with only one patrol squad due to high-priority calls elsewhere.""The challenges of policing in the city of Milwaukee are many,"" Alexander stated. ""Some areas of the city will at times go with only one squad to patrol the entire area of 44,000 citizens, as squads get pulled to other parts of the city to address high-priority calls, which can often be more violent in nature and require more officers.""The endorsement of Trump and Vance, according to Alexander, is rooted in the belief that addressing these policing challenges is a crucial matter for Milwaukee's safety and wellbeing. ""The Milwaukee Police Association believes that the solution to these challenges can be found right here. That’s why the MPA is endorsing the presidential ticket of Donald Trump and JD Vance,"" he concluded.

Pakistani minister says more arrests expected in retired ISI chief's court-martial case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-minister-says-more-arrests-expected-in-retired-isi-chiefs-court-martial-case/articleshow/112564172.cms,"LAHORE: More arrests will be made in connection with the court martial of former ISI chief General (Retd) Faiz Hameed in a housing scam, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said on Friday, a day after three more retired military officers were arrested in the case. Hameed, who served as director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) from 2019 to 2021, was arrested following action in the complaint of a private property developer over alleged misuse of official authority.""Investigations are underway in the Faiz case. More arrests are likely in the army and elsewhere,"" Dawn News quoted the minister as saying here.""It seems the ambit will not just remain limited to the military but whoever is involved and whoever has compromised the country's security… all those will come in its grasp,"" Tarar said.The minister's remarks came hours after the ISPR, the military's public affairs division, in a statement on Thursday said: ""In connection with the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) proceedings of Lt Gen (Retd) Faiz Hameed, three retired officers are also in military custody for their actions prejudicial to military discipline.""The ISPR said more retired officers and their associates were being probed for allegedly inciting instability in collaboration with and on behalf of a political entity with vested interests.The ISPR did not release the names or ranks of the officers arrested and did not indicate when the arrests had been made, but media reports claimed they were identified as Brigadier (Retd) Ghaffar, a former deputy director general for projects at ISI; Brig (Retd) Naeem Fakhar, a former officer commanding; and Colonel (Retd) Asim.Welcoming the fresh arrests in connection with the court martial proceedings against Gen Faiz for his alleged involvement in the case, Tarar said the institution of the army had prioritised self-accountability.""We think this act of self-accountability is positive and that it is a step that needs to be lauded, moving towards accountability and discord in the country being stopped.""Tarar said when a no-confidence motion was tabled against ex-prime minister Imran Khan, Gen Faiz was in contact with him. ""[Even] after going to jail Imran Khan remained in touch with Gen Faiz,"" he alleged.Taking note of the ISPR statement, Tarar regretted that discord and instability were being spread. Attempts were being made to impose an uncertain situation in the country and there were security attacks.""I think it is a very good and timely decision of the military to arrest Gen Hameed and the subsequent three officers,"" he said, adding that jailed former premier Khan was trying to dissociate himself from Gen Faiz Hameed but ""won't be able to save his neck"".The ISPR announcement follows speculation that numerous retired officers had been detained about Gen Hameed's trial for his post-retirement actions that violated the Army Act and on the complaint of the owner of a housing society in Islamabad, which had been referred to the Defence Ministry by the Supreme Court.Hameed was arrested on August 8 after being summoned to Rawalpindi by a senior army officer, with his detention only being publicly confirmed on the following Monday.His trial is being described as one of the most high-profile court martials in the history of the Pakistan Army.The unprecedented arrest of the top-ranking officer, who led the premier intelligence agency, broke the myth in the country that such powerful officers were beyond the reach of law.Lt Gen (retd.) Hameed was considered extremely powerful when he headed the spy agency from 2019 to 2021.He was appointed to the coveted post when then ISI chief and current Army chief Lt Gen Asim Munir was prematurely removed from the post. It was reported then that Khan was not happy with Munir.Later, the army decided to replace Hameed, a move vehemently opposed by Khan. It is believed that it was the beginning of the souring of his ties with the powerful military.Hameed took premature retirement in November 2022, four months before his retirement date after the current army chief took over. He was considered close to then Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa.The post of ISI chief is considered one of the most important in the Pakistan Army, which has ruled the country for more than half of its 76-plus years of existence and has wielded considerable power in security and foreign policy matters.","More arrests will be made in connection with the court martial of former ISI chief General (Retd) Faiz Hameed.

Pakistan govt accuses ISI ex-chief of political interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-govt-accuses-isi-ex-chief-of-political-interference/articleshow/112504585.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement. Asif’s statement came hours after the military announced Hameed’s arrest, saying field court martial proceedings had been initiated against him.Speaking to a private news channel, Asif accused the retired general of violating the Army Act by interfering in politics in Dec 2022.The act bars officials from engaging in political activity for two years after retirement. “Gen Faiz was definitely involved in the events that took place in the political scene post his retirement,” the minister said.When asked about Hameed’s involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots by alleged supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, the minister said, “He might have provided a little bit of logistics and provided his experience of conspiracies, and may have defined targets for protesters to inflict maximum damage,” adding, “You can say he might have had the role of a strategic adviser in the May 9 attacks.”Following Imran’s brief arrest in a graft case last year, his supporters had attacked and damaged government and military assets. Hundreds of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers and politicians were arrested after the riots. Some still remain behind bars. The military has also initiated army court trials against more than 100 people accused of involvement in the May 9, 2023 violence.Gen Hameed’s arrest has sparked widespread speculation, with many linking the move to his close ties with Imran who has demanded the formation of a judicial commission to probe the ex-spymaster’s arrest to check if it was linked to the May 9 events.Many politicians accused Gen Hameed of using harsh methods and coercive techniques while serving as ISI chief to please his military and political superiors and achieve his own personal goals. Former PM Nawaz Sharif has repeatedly claimed that Hameed, a number of Supreme Court judges, and former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa were responsible for his ouster in 2017. Hameed was then leading an ISI wing concerned with domestic issues.Gen Hameed had replaced General Asim Munir, the current army chief, as ISI director-general in 2019. Gen Munir was unceremoniously fired by Imran when the latter was PM. The rivalry between these three individuals is partly to blame for Pakistan’s current political turmoil.As the spy agency’s head Gen Hameed had used his authority to threaten and detain Imran’s political rivals, including former PMs, on what they claimed were false accusations. He was seen by opposition politicians as a spy chief who had managed PTI’s past govt activities from behind the scenes.Both Hameed and Imran had approved the policy of repatriating Pakistani Taliban militants from Afghanistan back to Pakistan, which critics claim has led to the return of militancy to Pakistan. Hameed has also been perceived as a supporter of the Afghan Taliban, having backed their takeover of Kabul following the American withdrawal in Aug 2021.In Oct 2021, Gen Bajwa had removed Hameed as spy chief, prompting Khan to oppose the move before eventually agreeing. As a PM, Imran had publicly acknowledged that he wanted to retain Hameed as ISI chief because of the situation in Afghanistan.","Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement.
