Digvijaya Singh's Modi-RSS Praise Draws Jibes From BJP Amid CWC Meet

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing controversy over Digvijaya Singh 's remarks praising the RSS’s organisational strength, Andhra Pradesh chief minister Revanth Reddy hailed Sonia Gandhi 's role in Congress leadership, citing examples of elevation of Manmohan Singh and P V Narasimha Rao to the post of Prime Minister.In a social media post on X, Reddy, on the 140th foundation day of the Congress, said that the party “has shaped every defining chapter of modern India.”“Congress: a force for the people of India was born 140 years ago on this day. The story of the Indian National Congress is the story of Indian democracy in motion. When one reflects on the leadership of Smt Sonia Gandhi Ji, we find service, commitment, ethics and values,” Reddy said.“Under Smt Sonia Gandhi Ji’s leadership, it became possible for Shri P V Narasimha Rao garu, who started his public career from a remote village in Telangana, to rise to become Prime Minister of the country. Smt Sonia Gandhi Ji also made an economist like Dr Manmohan Singh Ji the Prime Minister. From leading India’s freedom struggle to framing the Constitution, from building democratic institutions to uniting a diverse nation, the Indian National Congress has shaped every defining chapter of modern India,” he added.This comes after Digvijaya Singh stirred a controversy by sharing a black-and-white photograph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi sitting on the floor near senior BJP leader L K Advani in Gujarat.Singh commented on the ability of grassroots workers to ascend through the ranks to become chief minister and eventually Prime Minister, attributing it to the “power of organisation.”He tagged several senior Congress leaders, including party president Mallikarjun Kharge, MPs Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Jairam Ramesh, Prime Minister Modi, and the official Congress handles.Reportedly, the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister rued “over-centralisation” in the Congress and pushed for decentralisation in the presence of top leadership at the CWC meeting held on Saturday.He also complained that district and state chiefs were appointed by the AICC and questioned why decisions taken at the Udaipur Chintan Shivir, including setting up an election management department, had not been implemented.Last week, Singh had also praised Rahul Gandhi for his stance on socio-economic issues, giving him “full marks,” while calling for internal reforms within the Congress. Drawing a parallel with Rahul Gandhi’s push for Election Commission reforms, Singh argued that the party itself needed similar changes.In another post on X, he wrote, “Rahul ji, you are absolutely ‘bang on’ in matters of socio-economic issues. Full marks. But now please look at Congress also. Like the Election Commission needs reforms, so does the Indian National Congress. You have started with ‘Sangathan Srijan’, but we need more pragmatic, decentralised functioning.”He added, “I am sure you would do it because I know you can do it. The only problem is that it is not easy to ‘convince’ you!!”","Andhra Pradesh chief minister Revanth Reddy hailed Sonia Gandhi's role in Congress leadership.

30–35 terrorists on radar: Army steps up counterterror ops in J&K; heightened vigilance amid 'Chillai Kalan',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3035-terrorists-on-radar-army-steps-up-counterterror-ops-in-jk-heightened-vigilance-amid-chillai-kalan/articleshow/126211810.cms,"Indian Army Intensifies Anti-Terror Ops In J&K To Flush Out Pak Terrorists Amid Chillai Kalan

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing Chillai Kalan — the 40-day bone-chilling winter period — in Jammu and Kashmir , the Army has intensified its counter-terrorism operations across the Kishtwar and Doda districts.Army units have expanded their operational reach into higher and snowbound areas to pursue and neutralise Pakistani terrorists attempting to exploit the harsh season for concealment, news agency ANI reported, citing sources.According to sources, various intelligence agencies asses that there are approximately 30 to 35 Pakistani terrorists currently in the Jammu region.Inputs gathered over the past few months suggest that these groups, finding themselves cornered by successful counter-terror operations, have shifted deeper into higher and middle mountain reaches of the region — areas now devoid of habitation. These terrorists are believed to be seeking temporary winter hideouts to evade detection and avoid direct confrontation with security troops, they added.The sources said that the Army and security forces have adopted a proactive winter posture, establishing temporary bases and surveillance posts deep within snow-covered areas to maintain continuous pressure on potential terrorist hideouts.This year's counter-terror strategy has been the integrated approach to operations. The Indian Army is leading a synchronised effort involving multiple security and law enforcement agencies, including the civil administration, the Jammu and Kashmir Police (JKP), the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), the Special Operations Group (SOG), Forest Guards, and Village Defence Guards (VDGs).This inter-agency cooperation ensures seamless intelligence sharing, resource optimisation, and sharper operational execution, sources said.ANI reported that intelligence from multiple agencies is carefully synthesised to draw precise situational pictures of terrorist movement and hideout patterns. Once intelligence is verified, coordinated joint operations are planned and launched, minimising overlaps and ensuring maximum impact with tactical precision.The synergy among ground units and intelligence frameworks has enhanced response time, enabling security forces to act the moment actionable information surfaces.According to the report, the terrorists, who are hiding in this region, are attempting to coerce or threaten local villagers for shelter and food supplies, though their support among locals and overground workers has sharply declined.Sources emphasised that this season's winter operations are guided by a clear doctrinal approach: Surveillance to Swift Operations and then Back to Surveillance.The philosophy emphasises an unbroken cycle of monitoring, quick response, and sustained watchfulness, minimising the chances of terrorists regrouping. This methodical rhythm allows forces to keep pressure constant while conserving resources and adapting to environmental challenges, they added.This comes with the onset of Chillai Kalan, the harshest phase of Kashmir's winter, spanning from December 21 to January 31. During this period, most activity in the mountains comes to a standstill.Meanwhile, the Indian Army has also deployed specially trained winter warfare sub-units across several key sectors. These troops, adept in high-altitude survival, snow navigation, avalanche response, and snow combat, have been instrumental in maintaining operational effectiveness during the winter surge.",Indian Army has intensified its counter-terrorism operations across the Kishtwar and Doda districts.

'Tragic that patriotic people of northeast are referred to as Chinese and attacked'

DEHRADUN: A 24-year-old MBA student from Tripura, who confronted a group of men hurling racial slurs at him and his younger brother, died in a Dehradun hospital on Friday after fighting for his life for over 14 days. The stabbing happened on Dec 9, minutes after Anjel Chakma said, ""We are not Chinese... We are Indians. What certificate should we show to prove that?"" The six men allegedly responded with brutal violence.What began as a regular grocery run to the local market in the Selaqui area of Uttarakhand's capital city turned into a fatal confrontation that evening.Anjel and his brother Michael, both students in Dehradun for over a year, were stopped and taunted by a group of men who allegedly referred to them in derogatory terms. When Anjel calmly stood his ground, the situation turned uglier.Michael would later tell police and friends how his brother calmly but firmly corrected them. That assertion, of identity and dignity, was met with knives. ""Soon after Anjel replied, they attacked him and his brother while hurling abuses,"" said a friend of Anjel's, who remained at the hospital through the two weeks that followed. ""Anjel suffered serious injuries to his neck and spine.Michael is also injured and still in a serious condition. ""The friend requested anonymity, but his voice carried anger and disbelief. ""He was one of the calmest, friendliest people. We're all broken by what happened."" Anjel's body was flown to Agartala on Saturday, as Tripura erupted in anger. His family was assisted by Pradyot Bikram Manikya Debbarma, chairman of Tipra Motha Party and a member of the erstwhile Tripura royal family, who had been in touch with the family since the day of the incident and had supported his medical treatment.Speaking to TOI, Debbarma said on Saturday, ""It's tragic that the patriotic people of the northeast are called Chinese and attacked. Those who hurl racist slurs forget that it is because of the brave people of the northeast that China cannot enter the country. These incidents don't just hurt families. They divide our people. And when we are divided, we are vulnerable. We don't want that. We want justice.""Suraj Debbarma, state president of Youth Tipra Federation, the youth wing of Tipra Motha, who helped coordinate Anjel's last rites, said: ""People from the northeast face racial slurs and xenophobic attacks in the north regularly. But when students from north Indian states come to central institutions in the northeast, they are welcomed like fellow countrymen. We lost an innocent soul in a hate crime. That's the tragedy. ""Police said the case was registered on Dec 12 on a complaint filed by Michael Chakma, 21. Five of the six accused - including two juveniles - were apprehended on Dec 14.Senior sub-inspector Jitendra Kumar of Selaqui police station said on Sunday, ""Yagya Awasthi, the main accused, is suspected to have fled to Nepal... Two police teams have been dispatched to track him down and nab him, and a reward of Rs 25,000 has been announced. After Anjel's death, we added additional BNS sections - 103(1) (murder) and 3(5) (committing crime with common intention).""Initially, the FIR was filed under BNS sections 115(2) (voluntarily causing hurt), 118 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons), and 351(3) (criminal intimidation). On Dec 14, based on doctors' statements, sections 109 (attempt to murder) and 61 (criminal conspiracy) were added.The charges were upgraded again after Anjel's death. Friends recalled how Anjel, in his final days, struggled but never regained full consciousness. Protests have begun in colleges in the northeast, demanding a national law against racial hate crimes. In Dehradun, too, student organisations are beginning to speak up.","Anjel Chakma, 24, died in Dehradun hospital on Friday after fighting for his life for over 14 days.

"On the roof of the world, feral dogs hunt down Ladakh’s rare species",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ladkah-on-the-roof-of-the-world-feral-dogs-hunt-down-ladakhs-rare-species/articleshow/126218554.cms,"Lean, feral dogs move with predatory intensity across a snow-dusted desert, Ladakh's stark peaks looming behind.

SRINAGAR: It’s bloody murder on the roof of the world.A new predator has quietly grown to dangerous numbers. Feral dogs roam the cold desert of Ladakh, preying, often in packs, on endangered wildlife and attacking people. Conservationists warn that they outnumber native predators in the region.What began as a byproduct of increased tourism, military deployment, and unmanaged waste in the cold desert moonscape of Ladakh has grown into a full-blown crisis. And it’s manmade.Scientists and wildlife officials warn that these free-ranging canines — estimated by the WCBCL at nearly 45,000, far in excess of what the region’s ecology can sustain — are preying on some of Ladakh’s rarest high-altitude species. They threaten snow leopards, wolves and foxes, and prey on rare species like Pallas’s cat, the Eurasian lynx, Tibetan gazelle, blue sheep, ibex, and Himalayan marmots, said Lobzang Visuddha, chairman of the Wildlife Conservation and Birds Club of Ladakh (WCBCL), a community-based voluntary initiative by young people.The killing of a Pallas’s cat, one of the rarest and least-studied species, by feral dogs in Anley last year has alarmed conservationists like Visuddha. “In fact, there are records of killing two Pallas’s cats and Eurasian lynxes by feral dogs,” he saidThe dogs also threaten ground-nesting birds, with packs frequently chasing black-necked cranes, the UT’s state bird, and attacking ruddy shelduck chicks when they move from rocky nesting sites to nearby water bodies, Visuddha said.Advocate Tashi Gyalson, who headed the local government in Leh as chairman of the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council from Nov 2020 to Nov 2025, said the issue hasn't been arisen all of a sudden. “We have to admit that this situation has actually been created by humans over a long period of time,” he said.Gyalson said these dogs have been part of the ecosystem and community but rapid urbanisation meant they lost their use as hunting dogs, shepherd dogs, watchdogs and companion animals. “This, multiplied by the abundant carrying capacity of the environment, caused their rapid multiplication, and eventually caused the current situation,” he said.Experts say the worst hit is eastern Ladakh, the region with the highest concentration of wildlife, where poor waste management are subsidising the dog population.“The main concern is the availability of excess kitchen waste in areas occupied by the Army and areas where there is tourism,” Gyalson said.The stretch from Kargyan Chibra to Tsokar, in eastern Ladakh, has become a hotspot for feral dog activity due to unsustainable waste “Feral dogs are by far the most serious threat as far as the wildlife of Ladakh is concerned. I have myself seen how stray dogs in Hanle and Tso Moriri actually raided the nests of the black-necked crane, and preyed upon the eggs and young ones,” said Intesar Suhail, who was wildlife warden of Ladakh in 2013-14.“I have even seen them chasing animals as big as the Tibetan wild ass. The active ground nests of waterbirds, particularly the black-necked crane and bar-headed goose, are more vulnerable as they are located in marshy areas, surrounded by shallow waters easily accessible to dogs,” he said.A strong sense of smell and pack behaviour give feral dogs a lethal advantage over wildlife that evolved without such human-introduced predators, Visuddha said.“Though these species face natural threats in the wild, feral dogs are not one of them, they are a problem introduced by humans,” said the WCBCL founder.Ladakh has also reported at least five fatal attacks on humans, mostly on women and children, by feral dogs, which was unheard of in the region until recently, he said.Phuntsog Wangail, president of the Chamba Animal Welfare Society, which runs Ladakh’s largest animal care facility, said Ladakh was facing growing fears of long-term ecological imbalance due to feral dogs.They survive largely on food waste from tourist camps, hotels, roadside dhabas and temporary settlements. When these facilities close or relocate, particularly during winter, the canines are left without reliable food sources and begin roaming over long distances.“This seasonal movement pushes dogs into wildlife habitats, increases territorial conflicts, and accelerates breeding, placing Ladakh’s fragile ecosystem under severe pressure,” Wangail said.Visuddha said the feral dog threat to wildlife of Ladakh was next only to human activity.The rapid infrastructure expansion, including road building, power lines and mobile towers, has already fragmented habitats, while the expansion of camps, resorts, guest houses and hotels has intensified pressure on wildlife, he said.In winter, when tourism grinds to a halt and food becomes scarce, the dogs roam extensively, leading to a rise in dog-bite cases, road accidents and formation of aggressive packs. “At the same time, winter offers the best window for sterilisation, as dogs tend to remain closer to human settlements.”Data from the Animal Husbandry Department in Leh shows that 32,887 dogs were sterilised between 2015 and 2024, yet officials and conservationists say the population remains dangerously high.Wangial said Ladakh should carry out mass sterilisation over the next two years, with a special focus on female dogs and puppies, while calling for strict enforcement of animal welfare laws, including heavy penalties for dog dislocation, abandonment and cruelty.He called for the replication of successful models from the Netherlands and Bhutan, where mass sterilisation, strict enforcement of animal welfare laws and strong community participation have led to significant reductions in stray populations.While Visuddha said govt appears unconcerned about the issue, Gyalson offered a contrasting view. He said that after Ladakh became a Union Territory in 2019, a mission-mode campaign was launched to control the dog population. “The impact of the programme is visible as there are far fewer street puppies, especially in Leh city,” he said.However, Gyalson said several challenges continue to hinder effective population control, including Ladakh’s vast and rugged terrain, extreme climate, dispersed dog population, difficulties in capturing animals, and the absence of an accurate census.","Scientists and wildlife officials warn that these free-ranging canines — estimated by the WCBCL at nearly 45,000 — are preying on some of Ladakh’s rarest high-altitude species. Conservationists warn that they outnumber native predators in the region.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126218917,imgsize-191006,width-400,resizemode-4/predators-on-the-plain.jpg"

The Congress has only spread hatred, terror, and for you to suggest that the RSS, there is nothing to learn from, let me please say, the only thing to learn from RSS is nation-building, which is for Congress to learn. ""On the day the Congress marked its 140th foundation anniversary, senior leader Digvijay Singh’s remarks praising the RSS's organisational strength drew divided reactions from the party leaders, raising fresh questions about potential internal discord.Some Congress leaders dismissed the idea that the RSS could offer any lessons to their party, while others subtly took veiled jibe at Singh.Digvijay Singh sparked row after he shared a black-and-white photograph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi sitting on the floor near senior BJP leader LK Advani in Gujarat. Singh commented on the ability of grassroots workers to ascend through the ranks to become chief minister and eventually Prime Minister, attributing this to the ""power of organisation.""He tagged several senior Congress figures, including party president Mallikarjun Kharge, MPs Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Jairam Ramesh, PM Modi, and the official Congress handles.","Congress MP Manickam Tagore compared the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh with Islamic terror outfit al-Qaida.

We can learn from ourselves, too,"" the Thiruvananthapuram MP said.""There should be discipline in our organisation.

The organisation must be strengthened, there is no question about it.”Tharoor's remarks came on the party’s 140th Foundation Day, which Tharoor described as “a very important day for the party” and “a day when we look back at our remarkable history and the contribution of Congress.”On Saturday, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting convened to finalise programmes to corner the government over the VB-G RAM G Act, was overshadowed by internal disquiet after Singh’s social media post praising the RSS-BJP’s organisational structure.Singh had shared a 1990s photograph showing a young Narendra Modi seated on the floor while senior BJP leaders, including L K Advani, sat on chairs, calling it “very impressive” and describing PM Modi’s rise as the “strength of organisation”.At the CWC meeting, Singh reportedly criticised “over-centralisation” within Congress and pushed for decentralisation.The BJP seized on Singh’s comments. Spokesman Sudhanshu Trivedi said the BJP recognises a “gudri ke laal” like PM Modi, while Congress focuses on “Jawahar ke laal”.Singh later clarified that his remarks had been misunderstood. “I was, am and will be a trenchant critic of the RSS and Modi,” he said. He reiterated, “I am opposed to the ideology of the RSS… But I admire their organisational capacity.”Meanwhile, Congress media department chairman Pawan Khera drew a sharp line, saying, “There’s nothing to learn from the RSS. What can an organisation known for Godse teach an organisation founded by Gandhi?”Party MP Manickam Tagore shared a clip of an “excellent” own goal in football, writing, ""Famous Self goal.

Hadi Killing: Dhaka Police Say Main Accused Escaped to India via Meghalaya

NEW DELHI: Security agencies in Meghalaya on Sunday rejected claims by the Bangladesh Police that the killers of student leader Sharif Osman Hadi had entered the state. They termed the allegations as unfounded and misleading.""There is no evidence to suggest that any individual crossed the international border from the Haluaghat sector into Meghalaya. The BSF has neither detected nor received any report of such an incident,"" BSF chief in Meghalaya, Inspector General O P Opadhyay was quoted as saying by PTI.A senior Meghalaya police officer said there was “no input or intelligence to corroborate” claims that the suspects were present in the Garo Hills region, adding that local police units had detected no such movement and that coordination with central agencies was ongoing.

Digvijaya Singh's Modi-RSS Praise Draws Jibes From BJP Amid CWC Meet

Who said what

Digvijay Singh issues clarification

Calls for organisational restructuring within Congress

How BJP reacted

NEW DELHI: On the day the Congress marked its 140th foundation anniversary, senior leader Digvijay Singh’s remarks praising the RSS's organisational strength drew divided reactions from the party leaders, raising fresh questions about potential internal discord.Some Congress leaders dismissed the idea that the RSS could offer any lessons to their party, while others subtly took veiled jibe at Singh.Digvijay Singh sparked row after he shared a black-and-white photograph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi sitting on the floor near senior BJP leader LK Advani in Gujarat. Singh commented on the ability of grassroots workers to ascend through the ranks to become chief minister and eventually Prime Minister, attributing this to the ""power of organization.""He tagged several senior Congress figures, including party president Mallikarjun Kharge, MPs Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Jairam Ramesh, PM Modi, and the official Congress handles.""I found this picture on the Quora site. It is very impressive. In what way did the grassroots swayamsevak of RSS and the worker of Jan Sangh BJP sit on the floor at the feet of leaders and become the Chief Minister of the state and the Prime Minister of the country? This is the power of the organisation.Jai Siya Ram."" Singh's X post read.Reacting to Singh's remarks, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said that an organisation ""known for Nathuram Godse"" cannot teach anything to an organisation founded by Gandhi.""There's nothing to learn from the RSS. What can an organisation known for Godse teach an organisation founded by Gandhi?"" Khera said.Additionally, Congress MP Manickam Tagore launched a sharp attack on Digvijay Singh by sharing a video of an excellent own goal in a football match, writing, ""Famous Self goal. We have one.""Later, he also added that there is ""nothing to learn from Godse's organisation other than Hate. Congress at 140 is still young, and fights hate.""Sachin Pilot said that the opposition party is united, but everyone has the right to their own opinion.""Congress party is united. The country needs a strong opposition. Our intention is to strengthen the organisation. In our party, we have the right to speak about our thoughts,"" Pilot said.""He said whatever he had to, and after that, he also gave his clarification. All the Congress leaders have only one goal to strengthen Kharge and Rahul ji,"" he added.Meanwhile, Shashi Tharoor, known for ruffling feathers within Congress, distanced himself from Digvijay Singh's remarks, saying, “We have a history of 140 years, and we can learn a lot from it. We can learn from ourselves, too,""""There should be discipline in our organisation. Digvijay Singh can speak for himself,"" he added.He, however, also said that organization must be strengthened within Congress.Calling Digvijay Singh a “friend”, Tharoor, when asked whether he had spoken to Singh since he made his remarks, said: “We are friends, and having a conversation is natural. The organisation must be strengthened, there is no question about it.”Earlier, Digvijay Singh had issued a clarification, saying, ""I've been saying this from the beginning: I am opposed to the ideology of the RSS. They neither respect the Constitution nor the country's laws, and it's an unregistered organisation.""""But I admire their organisational capacity because an organisation that isn't even registered has become so powerful that the Prime Minister says from the Red Fort that it is the world's largest NGO. If it's an NGO, then where have your rules and regulations gone? But I admire their organisational capacity,"" he added.Earlier this week, Singh had also praised Rahul Gandhi for his stance on socio-economic issues, giving him ""full marks"" while calling for internal reforms within the Congress. Drawing a parallel with Rahul Gandhi’s push for Election Commission reforms, Singh argued that the party itself needed similar changes.In another post on X, he wrote, ""Rahul ji you are absolutely ‘Bang On’ in matters of Socio-Economic Issues. Full Marks. But now please look at Congress also. Like Election Commission needs Reforms, So Does Indian National Congress. You have started with 'Sanghatan Srijan' But we need more Pragmatic Decentralised Functioning.""He added, ""I am sure you would do it because I know you can do it. Only problem is that it is not easy to ‘Convince’ you!!""This is not the first time when senior leaders in Congress have called for organisational restructuring. In December, former Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim wrote to Sonia Gandhi , calling for ""open-heart surgery"" in the party and flagging a growing disconnect between the leadership and its workers.In his letter to Sonia Gandhi dated December 8, ex-Odisha MLA Mohammed Moquim highlighted six consecutive election losses in Odisha and three in Lok Sabha while also questioning the selection of Mallikarjun Kharge as the party's leader, claiming that the 83-year-old veteran ""is unable to resonate with India's youth.""Similar concerns were also raised in the run-up to the Bihar assembly elections this year in November, where the distance between the ""leadership"" and the workers was on display during seat distribution talks.Earlier in 2020, a group of 23 senior leaders in the party had written a letter to Sonia demanding “collective and inclusive leadership” in the party. While some of these dissidents were expelled, others voluntarily left the party but nothing changed in the way Congress functioned.Meanwhile, BJP alleged that Digvijay Singh's praise for the organisational power of the BJP and the RSS was an ""open dissent"" against Rahul Gandhi's leadership in the party. BJP national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi alleged that Gandhi was bringing his party ""upside down"" because he had been sidelined in the party.""It's because our Narendra Modi is 'guddri ke lal' (diamond in the rough) and their leader is 'Jawahar ke lal' (great-grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru). Since our Narendra Modi has risen to top from bottom, he is taking the party (BJP) also to the top from bottom,"" Trivedi told a press conference at the BJP headquarters here.In a swipe to Gandhi, he said, ""Since their leader is 'Jawahar ke lal' who is now 'side down from up', he is bringing his party upside down.""BJP leader CR Kesavan termed the ""autocratic and undemocratic"" functioning of the Congress leadership.""Will Rahul Gandhi show courage & react to the shocking Truth Bomb dropped by Shri. Digvijay Singh's tweet, which has totally exposed how Congress' first family ruthlessly runs the party in a dictatorial manner, and also how autocratic & undemocratic this Congress leadership is?"" Kesavan's X post read.Digvijaya Singh later clarified that while he appreciates strong organisational structures, he remains firmly opposed to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""I support the organisation. I am against the RSS and Modi ji. You have misunderstood. I have praised 'sangathan'. I was, am, and will remain a staunch opponent of the RSS and Modi. Is it a bad thing to strengthen and praise the organisation?"" he said.","Digvijay Singh sparked row after he shared a black-and-white photograph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi sitting on the floor near senior BJP leader LK Advani in Gujarat.

‘Woman married 2nd time, not entitled to maintenance’

Heartbreak, divorce & deadly crimes | Dark Truth Of Failed Marriages | Ft. Anand Handa

MUMBAI: In an unexpected turn, a woman’s current husband took the witness stand to depose on behalf of her ex-spouse, ending a nearly 17-year-old domestic violence case.The case, initiated in 2009 by the woman, alleged years of torture by her first husband. She sought protection and monetary relief, claiming she was ousted from her home. However, a Borivli court ruled that with her current husband confirming marriage, she was not entitled to maintenance.Additional chief judicial magistrate B N Chikne said, “As such, in such facts and circumstances and the evidence on record, it appears to me that it is proved from the evidence and documents produced on record, after divorce from the respondent No. 1 (ex-husband), the applicant (woman) performed a second marriage. Therefore, she is not entitled to get maintenance from respondent No. 1.”The judgment centred on the revelation that the woman had entered into a second marriage while her original maintenance claim was still active.In her plea, the woman said she married her ex-husband in 2005 through an arranged setup. She alleged that she later found out that the man was already married and his first wife began to frequent their home.Along with the ex-husband, his first wife would abuse her too. She alleged numerous incidents of physical, emotional and economic abuse. In Dec 2009, the first husband was directed to pay the woman an interim monthly maintenance of Rs 3,200 until the disposal of the case.While the woman’s sister served as a witness to support her allegations, the man brought to court an imam who officiated the woman’s second marriage, a handwriting and fingerprint expert who testified on the signatures and thumb impression on the nikahnama of the second marriage, and her husband.The trajectory of the trial shifted dramatically when her ex-husband produced her current husband as a defence witness to confirm their marital status. By confirming the second marriage through the evidence of the current husband himself, the defence nullified the woman’s status as a dependent of her former spouse.The court ruled the existence of this second union, confirmed by the man who entered into it, extinguished the woman's right to seek further maintenance or protection from her first husband.","The case, initiated in 2009 by the woman, alleged years of torture by her first husband.

NEW DELHI: The survivor of the 2017 Unnao rape case on Sunday said that she fears for the safety of her children after the Delhi high court suspended the life sentence of expelled BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar.Reacting to the CBI’s petition before the apex court, the survivor told news agency ANI, “I have faith in the Supreme Court that it will give me justice. I am raising the voice of every women... Had CBI done this before, I would have got justice. His (Kuldeep Sengar) bail would have been rejected because he raped me. My father was killed. My family members were killed. The security of my family members and witnesses was removed. .. My husband was fired from his job. My children are unsafe at home.The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear the CBI’s plea on December 29. As per the cause list, a bench headed by Chief Justice Surya Kant, along with Justices J K Maheshwari and Augustine George Masih, will take up the matter. The court will also hear a separate petition filed by advocates Anjale Patel and Pooja Shilpkar challenging the high court’s order.On December 23, the Delhi high court suspended Sengar’s life sentence in the rape case, noting that he had already served seven years and five months in prison. The suspension will remain in force while his appeal against conviction is pending. The CBI moved the Supreme Court against the order on December 26.Sengar was convicted in December 2019 and sentenced to life imprisonment along with a fine of Rs 25 lakh. While the high court granted him bail in the rape case, he will continue to remain in jail as he is serving a separate 10-year sentence in a CBI case related to the custodial death of the survivor’s father. His appeal in that case, along with a plea seeking suspension of sentence, is also pending.The high court imposed several conditions while granting bail, including a personal bond of Rs 15 lakh with three sureties, a direction not to enter a 5-km radius of the survivor’s residence in Delhi, and a strict bar on threatening her or her mother.","Kuldeep Singh Sengar was convicted in December 2019 and sentenced to life imprisonment along with a fine of Rs 25 lakh.

CHENNAI: Lottery operator Santiago Martin’s son, Jose Charles Martin, on Friday said his party, Latchiya Jananayaka Katchi (LJK), had expressed interest in an alliance with Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) ahead of the 2026 Assembly election, marking a shift from his earlier criticism of TVK president Vijay ’s political messaging.“We have expressed our interest. Now the response has to come from their side. We have conveyed our willingness,” Jose told reporters when asked about the possibility of an alliance, citing Vijay’s stated position against corruption.Jose said he had not yet spoken directly to Vijay. “We have sent a request first. If they show interest, we will go and meet him,” he said, adding that any meeting would depend on a response from the actor-politician.Responding to questions on his earlier remarks that Vijay’s Erode speech lacked clarity, Jose said his position was being misread. “The speech he delivered last time was like that. We said that the response it received was of that nature because of how he spoke.”“When we say there is a lack of clarity, what we mean is that the people around him are not at that level,” he said. “That clarity is supposed to be provided by them, because the information they are giving him is incorrect.”He also cited Vijay’s limited physical presence in Puducherry as a factor. “He is not going to be here regularly,” Jose said. “The people who are here are the ones who can sit down, get involved, and assess things on the ground. In such a situation, for a local party like ours, it would be good if we have their support.”Jose did not name Aadhav Arjuna, Vijay’s aide and his son-in-law, whom he had earlier accused of misleading the TVK leadership.","Lottery operator Santiago Martin’s son, Jose Charles Martin, on Friday said his party, Latchiya Jananayaka Katchi, had expressed interest in an alliance with Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam.

MUMBAI: In a sophisticated twist to digital arrest scams, a 68-year-old woman from the western suburbs was duped of Rs 3.75 crore by fraudsters who staged a mock virtual court hearing featuring a man who claimed he was ""Justice Chandrachud"".Moving beyond the usual khaki-clad impersonations, the scammers got the victim to write an ""essay on her life"".

Police said the actual callers often operate from outside the country where it's tough for Indian law enforcement to reach them.The woman's ordeal began on Aug 18 when she received a call from ""Colaba police station"" claiming her bank account was linked to a Rs 6 crore money laundering case.The complainant explained she did not operate any such bank account. But the caller had already assigned her a ""case number"" and a letter with details about her case. To ""prove"" her innocence, she was subjected to a series of high-pressure tactics.

""Officer S K Jaiswal"" took over & asked her to pen a 2-3 page essay about her life to evaluate her character. He said he was convinced of her innocence and assured her she would get bail soon. Her hearing was arranged before ""Justice Chandrachud"" soon after.The hearing started over video call and a man in judicial robes appeared, posing as ""Justice Chandrachud"". He asked her details about her money laundering case and ""rejected her bail"" when she pleaded non-guilty.She was asked to submit all her wealth for scrutiny and to redeem all her mutual funds as well.

The Collapse Of The Red Corridor: How India Broke The Back Of Maoist Extremism | I Witness

HYDERABAD: By torchlight in deep forest camps, a shadow surgeon once cut close to a beating Maoist heart, fingers steady as a bullet lay lodged centimetres away. For years, the man they called Dr Rafiq worked unseen. Little about him surfaced beyond intelligence files.Now, through surrendered Maoists and security officials, a detailed portrait is emerging of Rafiq alias Mandip — an MBBS from Punjab who joined CPI (Maoist) and spent years building a medical system across Dandakaranya in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar.Surrendered Maoist M Venkatraju alias CNN Chandu described Rafiq as the only formally trained doctor to have joined the movement. He treated cadres and Adivasis, performed emergency surgeries with scarce resources, trained paramedics and documented medicine. He wrote manuals standardising treatment for bullet wounds, malaria, snakebites, gastroenteritis, and battlefield trauma under forest conditions.Chandu told TOI, “He trained locals and cadres in first aid, stitching sutures when a bullet hits, and how to remove the bullet.”Intelligence officers said he moved from Dandakaranya to Jharkhand in 2016, where he remains at large.Rafiq first surfaced in 2013 through confessions of arrested cadres, described then as a “mystery doctor” capable of surgeries and leading Dandakaranya’s medical wing. Police inputs in 2018 referred to “Rinki, wife of MBBS Dr Rafiq”, who allegedly treated senior Maoist commander Prashant Bose.According to Chandu, Rafiq worked from Maad, the Maoist headquarters zone in Abujhmarh. “The doctor is revered as a god by locals,” he said. “People came from far away just to see him.”Forest villages with little or no access to formal healthcare relied on Rafiq for everything from fever treatment to trauma care.Several underground medics, known as “doctors” despite lacking degrees, were trained through Rafiq’s system. Each dalam had at least one trained medical aide, Chandu said. Medical continuity survived even after Rafiq left Dandakaranya.Rafiq also documented herbal medicine knowledge passed down by Adivasi vaddes or pujaris and incorporated it into Maoist man-uals. “Malaria is most common,” Chandu said. “People believed illness meant God was angry. We told them even if they do puja, they should also take medicine.” Prayer and pills coexisted in those manuals, which still circulate in interior areas.While security forces tracked weapons and movement, Rafiq quietly built medical capacity — a parallel health network shaped by war, forests and necessity. As surrenders rise, his trail remains elusive.","Dr Rafiq is an MBBS from Punjab who joined CPI (Maoist) and spent years building a medical system across Dandakaranya in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar.

‘Hindu Lives Matter’: Protest Outside Bangladesh High Commission In London Over Minority Killings

BSF dismisses Bangladesh claim, says no proof of any fugitive crossing the border into India

DHAKA/SHILLONG: Bangladesh claimed on Sunday that the two prime suspects in the murder of radical Inqilab Moncho leader Sharif Osman Hadi had found sanctuary in neighbouring Meghalaya, inviting instant rebuttals from Indian security agencies about what they said were ""fabricated and malicious"" statements suggesting lapses in BSF's border vigil.""Suspects Faisal Karim Masud and Alamgir Sheikh crossed into the Indian state of Meghalaya with the help of local associates,"" Dhaka Metropolitan Police's additional police commissioner (crime and operations) S N Md Nazrul Islam said at a presser. ""According to our information, the suspects entered India via the Haluaghat border.""Dhaka Metropolitan Police’s additional police commissioner (crime and operations) S N Md Nazrul Islam said his department had received “informal reports” about two men identified as “Purti and Sami” being detained in India for assisting the fugitives.BSF inspector general (Meghalaya frontier) Om Prakash Upadhyay said in Shillong that “there is no evidence to suggest any individual crossed the international border from the Haluaghat sector into Meghalaya” from Mymensingh in Bangladesh. “BSF has neither detected nor received any report of such an incident,” PTI quoted Upadhyay as saying. He said the international border was under constant surveillance & any attempt at illegal cross-border movement would be promptly detected and dealt with.Meghalaya DGP Idashisha Nongrang, too, issued a statement contradicting the Dhaka police officer’s claim about two alleged collaborators of the fugitives being detained in West Garo Hills. She said reports emerging from Bangladesh about the whereabouts of the killers of 32-year-old Hadi, whose shooting on December 12 plunged the country into another cycle of violent unrest, were “unfounded”.Bangladeshi media quoted Islam as alleging that local contacts helped the fugitives travel by taxi to Tura, the headquarters of West Garo Hills district. He insisted the Bangladesh govt was “actively working” to bring the suspects back. “We are maintaining communication with Indian authorities through both formal and informal channels to ensure their arrest and extradition,” Islam said.The unsubstantiated claims come in the wake of Inqilab Moncho’s 30-day ultimatum to the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt to arrest his killers.The countdown started on December 19, a day after Hadi died in a Singapore hospital of bullet injuries to the head. Hadi was among those who led the July-Aug 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh that led to Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League govt being toppled.He was a candidate for the upcoming February 12 parliamentary elections and was shot while campaigning in Dhaka. Hadi’s brother Omar recently accused some within the interim govt of orchestrating the killing to derail the polls.","BSF dismisses Bangladesh claim, says no proof of any fugitive crossing the border into India.

‘Love Jihad Claim False’: UP Woman Speaks Out After Bajrang Dal Crashes Birthday

SRINAGAR: Authorities placed Srinagar MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi of National Conference, opposition PDP legislator Waheed Parra, party functionary Iltija Mufti and others under house detention Sunday, stopping a student-backed protest against J&K’s current reservation policy and exposing sharp political fault lines within NC.The confrontation follows months of debate over changes to J&K reservation rules. Originally framed in 2004, the rules were amended by Union government in 2024 to grant Pahari-speaking population a 10% quota under scheduled tribe category, changes implemented the same year by LG administration. More than 15 new castes were also added to reservation list.Several political parties, including Peoples Conference, Mehdi and student activists, said the revised policy has sharply reduced open merit share in jobs and professional college admissions to below 40%.After a protest on Dec 23 last year outside CM Omar Abdullah’s home, Mehdi, Parra, Iltija and students were invited for talks. Omar assured a review of the framework, leading to formation of a cabinet sub-committee. After months of deliberations, its recommendations were sent to LG’s office early this month and remain pending.Mehdi had warned last month that if the issue was not resolved, he would sit with students in protest.Sunday’s detentions halted that plan but intensified pressure on the NC-led government navigating authority split with the LG amid renewed calls for statehood.NC president Dr Farooq Abdullah defended the detentions, accusing functionaries behind the protest of seeking disorder. “They do not want to see J&K move on the path of development. They want chaos, and we will not allow that,” he said. NC spokesperson Imran Nabi Dar claimed “many of them, I am told, requested for house arrest”.At the same time, NC chief spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq said the party remains committed to rationalising reservation quotas. The cabinet sub-committee’s report has been finalised and sent to the LG, he said. “At this point, the matter is no longer in the hands of elected government but we will pursue it.”Mehdi said police informed him Sunday morning he could not step out of his home before a planned demonstration with students in Srinagar. “We also received reports late last night that students have been arrested and their families intimidated by police,” he said.Law and order is under LG Manoj Sinha, but Mehdi demanded NC-led government clarify whether it played any role in the detentions. He asked government to specify a date by which a reservation file pending approval with the LG would be cleared, or join him in protest.Mehdi also urged government to lead a push for a discussion in Parliament on restoring special status for J&K, citing a resolution passed by the assembly in its first session last year.Police placed Parra under house arrest late Saturday. Iltija, daughter of PDP chief and former CM Mehbooba Mufti, said she too was confined. “The insecurity and paranoia of the security agencies knows no bounds. This is the ‘normalcy’ in Naya Kashmir. An entire contingent of female police personnel is deputed at the gate to physically stop me,” she said. J&K police and LG’s office issued no statements.","Srinagar MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi of National Conference, opposition PDP legislator Waheed Parra, party functionary Iltija Mufti and others under house detention.

Trump met Zelenskyy in Florida for the peace talks and said, ""Yes, I do (believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin is serious about peace this time). I think he is. I think they both are...They have to make a deal...Too many people died and both Presidents want to make a deal...I've settled eight wars and this is the most difficult one...We are going to have a great meeting today and this gentleman has worked very hard and he and his people are very brave...I am also calling President Putin back after the meeting, and we will continue the negotiations...""

Trump said, ""We're in the final stages of talking. We're going to see. Otherwise, it's going to go on for a long time. It'll either end, or it's going to go on for a long time, and millions of additional people are going to be killed and nobody wants that""

“It’ll either end, or it will go on for a LONG time!”: President Trump

President Donald Trump was flanked by various administration officials and allies as the US and Ukrainian delegations sat down for talks at Mar-a-Lago. In attendance were Trump’s foreign envoy Steve Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine, White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stepiller, hen MWhite House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Josh Gruenbaum, commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service at the General Services Administration, who was present at talks with Russian officials last week.

After meeting with Ukrainian President, Trump said, ""We had a terrific meeting. We discussed a lot of things. As you know, I had an excellent phone call with President Putin. It lasted for over two hours. We discussed a lot of points. I do think we're getting a lot closer, maybe very close. The President and I just spoke to the European leaders...We have made a lot of progress on ending that war, which is probably the deadliest war since World War II...""

The Ukrainian president said, "" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says, ""...We had great discussions on all the topics, and we appreciate the progress that the Americans and Ukrainian teams made in these recent weeks...We discussed all the aspects of the peace framework...There has been 90 per cent agreement on the 20-point peace plan, 100 per cent agreement on US-Ukraine security guarantees, and U.S.-Europe-Ukraine security guarantees are almost agreed.

US President Trump said that Ukraine and Russia are getting ""closer"" to settling the status of the disputed Donbas territory, but it remains challenging. ""It's unresolved, but it's getting a lot closer. That's a very tough issue, but one that I think will get resolved,"" Trump told reporters in response to a question about the Donbas, in a joint appearance at his Mar-a-Lago estate with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Trump: If things don't happen, they keep fighting and they keep dying. Zelenskyy does not want that to happen, we don't want that to happen, Putin does not want it to happen.

A Downing Street spokesperson said UK PM Starmer reaffirmed unwavering support for Ukraine and its commitment to achieving a just and lasting peace

Meanwhile, Trump’s call with Putin came as part of what is being viewed as an effort to negotiate a possible peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow. However, the Kremlin said the US and Russia agreed that a ceasefire “would only prolong the conflict.”

“I just had a very good and productive telephone call with President Putin of Russia” before the planned talks with Zelenskyy at Trump’s Florida estate at 1:00pm local time (1800 GMT), the US president said on Truth Social.

EU chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa also reaffirmed that the European Union ’s support for Ukraine “would not falter” ahead of the Florida meeting. They joined a call with Zelenskyy and several European leaders on Saturday.

Zelenskyy also met Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in Halifax the same day.

Earlier, Zelenskyy said the coming days could be decisive for efforts to end the war, even as Russia intensified missile and drone attacks across Ukraine amid heightened diplomatic activity.

The Florida talks will feature Zelenskyy’s “20-point peace deal proposal,” which he said is “about 90% ready.”

His spokesperson added that Trump and Zelenskyy will call European leaders after their meeting.





United States President Donald Trump met Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday at Mar-a-Lago for the peace talks.While posing with Zelenskyy outside the Florida house, Trump again bosted about ending eight wars and said that Russia and Ukraine have to make deal.""Yes, I do (believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin is serious about peace this time). I think he is. I think they both are...They have to make a deal...Too many people died and both Presidents want to make a deal...I've settled eight wars and this is the most difficult one...We are going to have a great meeting today and this gentleman has worked very hard and he and his people are very brave...I am also calling President Putin back after the meeting, and we will continue the negotiations. .."" Trump said.Just hours before his meeting with US President Donald Trump at the latter’s Florida club, Zelenskyy briefed UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on their “detailed phone call” and updated him on preparations for the Trump meeting. Earlier, Trump held what he described as a “productive” phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin ahead of the Florida talks.Zelenskyy informed Starmer about the frontline situation and the latest Russian strikes.“We discussed preparations for the meeting with President Trump, as well as all our contacts with European partners,” Zelenskyy wrote on X. “I informed him on the situation on the frontline and on the consequences of Russian strikes.”While Ukraine is pushing for concrete decisions, Zelenskyy noted that outcomes would depend heavily on international partners supporting Kyiv and maintaining pressure on Moscow.Highlighting the scale of recent Russian strikes, Zelenskyy said: “This week alone, they launched over 2,100 attack drones, around 800 guided aerial bombs, and 94 missiles of various types,” targeting civilians and critical infrastructure, especially energy systems.He said Ukrainian emergency and energy teams were working around the clock to mitigate the impact.“Our repair crews, energy workers, and first responders of Ukraine's State Emergency Service are working literally 24/7 to protect lives and restore power supply,” Zelenskyy said.","US President Donald Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Mar-a-Lago in Florida.

Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar Admits India Hit Nur Khan Air Base In Operation Sindoor Strikes





Pakistan has once again found itself on the defensive after a senior government official publicly acknowledged the impact of India’s precision strikes on a key military installation during the escalation in May, following Operation Sindoor The admission came from Pakistan’s foreign minister and deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who, during a year-end press briefing on Saturday, confirmed that India had targeted the Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi’s Chaklala area. Dar acknowledged that the strike caused damage to the military installation and injured personnel stationed there.Addressing reporters, Dar said India had launched multiple drone incursions into Pakistani territory within a short span, underlining the scale of the operation. “They (India) send drones towards Pakistan. In 36 hours, at least 80 drones were sent... We were able to intercept 79 drones out of 80, and only one drone damaged a military installation and personnel were also injured in the attack,” he claimed, according to news agency ANI.Also Read: 'Was advised to take shelter in bunker': Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari's big Op Sindoor admission - watch The foreign minister went on to describe the sequence of events following the strikes, saying that Pakistan’s civil and military leadership, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, held an emergency meeting on the night of May 9 to respond to the evolving situation.He added that India “made the mistake” of attacking the Nur Khan Air Base in the early hours of May 10, a remark that further acknowledged the strike and its impact.Dar’s comments amount to a rare public admission by a top Pakistani official of India’s military action on Pakistani air bases in May. The strikes came after Operation Sindoor, launched by the Indian Armed Forces to target nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, in retaliation for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians.The Pakistan Air Force’s Nur Khan Air Base in Chaklala suffered significant damage during the Indian precision strikes. India had launched Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7 as a direct response to the Pahalgam attack.The escalation that followed saw increased cross-border shelling by Pakistan and retaliatory action by Indian forces. The situation later took an unexpected turn when Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart to propose a ceasefire, which India accepted. The outreach from the Pakistani side was later confirmed by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, who said both sides agreed to halt all military operations on land, at sea and in the air.Satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies on May 13 showed significant damage to multiple Pakistani air bases, including Nur Khan Air Base. The images revealed damage at four installations: Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi, PAF Base Mushaf in Sargodha, Bholari Air Base and PAF Base Shahbaz in Jacobabad. A comparison of satellite images taken on April 25 and May 10 showed clear damage to air base facilities, corroborating the strikes.This is not the first time a senior Pakistani leader has acknowledged the attack on Nur Khan Air Base. In May, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif admitted that Indian ballistic missiles had hit the base and other locations, breaking from Pakistan’s usual practice of denying Indian military action.Addressing a ceremony at the Pakistan Monument on May 16, Sharif said, “At around 2:30 am on May 10, General Syed Asim Munir called me on a secure line and informed me that India's ballistic missiles had hit Nur Khan Airbase and other areas. Our Air Force used homegrown technology to save our country, and they even used modern gadgets and technology on Chinese jets,” Geo News reported.",Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar Admits India Hit Nur Khan Air Base In Operation Sindoor Strikes.

Putin 'TEASES' Zelensky; Offers Ukraine Land Captured By Russian Troops But Not Donbas | Report





Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday that he will meet US President Donald Trump in Florida over the weekend, as diplomatic efforts continue to bring an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine.Speaking to reporters, Zelenskyy said the discussions on Sunday will focus on security guarantees for Ukraine. He said negotiators are close to finalising a proposed 20-point peace framework, which “is about 90% ready.”The upcoming talks come as Washington leads a broad diplomatic initiative aimed at stopping Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022. Progress has been difficult due to major disagreements between Kyiv and Moscow over key conditions for ending the conflict.Zelenskyy said his announcement followed a “good conversation” on Thursday with US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, the US president’s son-in-law.Earlier in the week, Zelenskyy said Ukraine would consider pulling its forces out of parts of the eastern industrial region if Russia does the same. Under his proposal, the area would become a demilitarised zone overseen by international monitors.Also read: 'Terrorist scum': Why Trump ordered US strikes on ISIS in Nigeria — what it means Moscow has not signaled acceptance of such a plan.

Russian forces currently occupy most of Luhansk and roughly 70% of Donetsk, the two regions that make up the Donbas.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that contacts between Russian and US officials are ongoing following a recent meeting in Florida between Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev and US representatives. “It was agreed upon to continue the dialogue,” Peskov said.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he will meet US President Donald Trump in Florida over the weekend.

‘Love Jihad Claim False’: UP Woman Speaks Out After Bajrang Dal Crashes Birthday

BAREILLY: Around 25 right-wing activists including a self-proclaimed cow vigilante, allegedly barged into a private birthday celebration of a 20-year-old first-year female nursing student at a cafe in Bareilly and thrashed some of her male guests, raised ‘love jihad' slogans and created a ruckus after objecting to the presence of two Muslim students at the party.According to the victims, police initially fined the two students and a cafe staff member for ""breach of peace"" while no immediate action was taken against those who disrupted the event and assaulted the guests.Cops took note of the ""assault and harassment by the right-wing activists"" after a social media outrage.Bareilly SP (city) Manush Pareek said, ""We've identified those seen attacking inside the cafe, and an FIR has been registered under BNS sections 333 (house trespass), 115-2 (voluntarily causing hurt), 352 (intentional insult...), 351 (criminal intimidation) and 191 (rioting).

PUNE: Deputy chief minister and NCP chief Ajit Pawar on Sunday announced that NCP and NCP (SP) will contest the upcoming Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation elections in an alliance.Addressing a campaign rally in Talawade for party candidates, Pawar said, ""In Pimpri Chinchwad, NCP, the party with the clock symbol and NCP, the party with the trumpet symbol, will contest the civic election in an alliance. A parivar [family] is coming together as many people wanted this to happen.""Pawar said the seat-sharing arrangement between NCP and NCP (SP) has been finalised and will be announced within the next two days. ""We come from a farming family; farming is our caste. Some decisions must be taken in the larger interest of Maharashtra,"" he said.This marks the first official announcement of an alliance between the two parties, even as discussions continue for alliances in other municipal corporations, including Pune.During the rally, Pawar announced the party’s candidates for Ward 12, where the undivided NCP had won all four seats in the 2017 elections.The candidates are Pankaj Bhalekar, Sharad Bhalekar, Seema Bhalekar, and Charulata Sonawane. Later, at a public meeting in Chikhali for Ward 1, he announced Yash Sane, Vikas Sane, Sadhna Netaji Kashid, and Sangita Tamhane as party candidates.In his address, Pawar also credited NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar for bringing the IT park to Hinjewadi, saying the decision played a key role in the development of the twin city.It may be noted that under Ajit Pawar's leadership, first Congress between 1992 and 1999 and then the undivided NCP ruled Pimpri Chinchwad between 1999 and 2017. The BJP wrested control of the civic body in 2017, winning 77 of the 128 seats, while the NCP finished second.He said that despite his party being in power for 25 years, PCMC never took loans for development works.“PCMC was considered one of the richest municipal corporations in Asia. Today, it is burdened with debt and allegations of corruption, which were never part of its earlier history,” he said.Pawar said the NCP would ensure representation for candidates from all communities, drawing inspiration from the ideologies of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Shahu Maharaj, Jyotiba Phule, and BR Ambedkar. The candidate list, he said, would include a balance of youth and experienced leaders.Without naming individuals, Pawar also alleged that political opponents in Pimpri Chinchwad were threatening aspirants by warning that their construction projects would be stalled. “Women are being threatened, and such poaching politics has been never seen before.People have told me they were warned that their construction works would be stopped.

BENGALURU: Shocked by his wife's suicide two days ago, hounded by public sentiment and charged with dowry harassment and abetment to suicide, a 30-year-old Bengaluru resident died by suicide in a Nagpur hotel early Saturday after undertaking a 1,000km circuitous road journey along with his family members.Suraj Shivanna, a franchise owner of an online delivery service, and his family fled Bengaluru on Dec 25, and after a brief stopover in Hyderabad, reached Nagpur on Friday evening. They checked into their two rooms in a hotel around 9.30 pm.Suraj was found hanging in the hotel room by his 60-year-old mother, Jayanti, around 12:30am. Shattered to see her son dead, she too attempted to hang herself. She, however, survived as the noose snapped, and her cries alerted the hotel staff and other family members. Her elder son, Sanjay Shivanna, 36, lodged a police report. Suraj was taken to AIIMS-Nagpur, where doctors confirmed his death.Sanjay, a businessman based in Bengaluru, told police the family was forced to flee due to escalating threats from Suraj's in-laws following the suicide of his wife, Ganavi. ""Around 30 people stormed our house searching for Suraj, who was named in an FIR for dowry harassment.

"Red Fort blast: How a homegrown, educated module stayed invisible for years — and why Delhi failed to stop it",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/total-recall-2025-how-a-homegrown-educated-module-stayed-invisible-for-years-and-why-delhi-failed-to-stop-it/articleshow/126222321.cms,"2026, road ahead

NEW DELHI: For exactly 5,178 days, the streets of Delhi hummed with the deceptive rhythm of normalcy, a silence that many mistook for the permanent defeat of terror. This almost decade-anda-half-long hiatus, stretching from the 2011 High Court blast to the evening of Nov 10, 2025, was not merely a lapse in time but a period of dangerous metamorphosis for the adversary. When the car laden with ammonium nitrate and TATP finally detonated near Red Fort, it did more than just propel vehicles 30 feet up in air or cause over a dozen casualties; it exposed the birth of what intelligence circles now whisper as ""IM 2.0.""This was not the chaotic, trial-and-error Indian Mujahideen of the mid-2000s. This was a refined, ""white-collar"" evolution that had learned the hardest lessons of its predecessors, operating in the blind spots of a security apparatus that was looking everywhere but within its own city walls.The failure to prevent the Nov 10 attack lies in the chilling sophistication of the module's structure. In the first iteration of the IM, the presence of foreign technical experts often provided the crucial trail for agencies to follow.'IM 2.0' eliminated this vulnerability. The 2025 module was entirely homegrown, led not by street-level radicals, but by medical professionals and academics, including Dr Umar Un Nabi and Dr Shaheen.This was a ""doctor-led"" cell that functioned for two years under the very nose of the law enforcement agencies of Delhi, Haryana and J&K.They didn't need a foreign bombmaker because they possessed the scientific literacy to refine IEDs themselves. For over 700 days, they collected explosives, ammonium nitrate, and vehicles in small, undetectable increments.""Their success was rooted in their invisibility; they were taxpayers, healers and professors, far removed from the stereotypical ""radical"" profile that counterterror manuals are designed to flag,"" said a retired Delhi Police commissioner.While the terrorists were evolving into a streamlined, intellectual force, Delhi’s premier counter-terror and counter intelligence units were decaying into a state of institutional lethargy and internal strife. For the last 2-3 years, the focus of the city's anti-terror unit aka the 'special cell' had drifted dangerously, obsessing over criminal gangs, bookies and criminals of Punjab in the name of 'mandate'The anti-terror apparatus became a house divided by intra-unit politics, where rivalries between officers and ""camps"" within the unit took precedence over counter-terror operations. In 2024, the anti-terror unit had zero anti-terror operations of their own, disclosed an investigator who was then a part of the unit. The few that were executed on the inputs of central intelligence agencies were marred with goof-ups and glitches.The cracks in this foundation were visible long before the Red Fort blast. The brazen killing of businesman Nadir Shah in the heart of the capital — in front of the very sleuths meant to protect the capital from dangerous threats — was a neon sign of systemic failure.To fight evolving threats, the first priority, former cell members said, should be to have a dedicated anti-terror squad aka ATS, focussing just on terrorism, in place. A similar unit is coming up in Haryana in line with the national counter terror policy being rolled out. Officers pointed out that instead of turning cell into a copycat version of the NIA (National Investigation Agency), the unit’s founding ethos deserves a renaissance.""The ’white-collar’ threat is no longer a theoretical concern; it is a reality that bypasses traditional surveillance. The traditional ‘informer’ network, often comprised of petty criminals or arms smugglers, is also useless against educated professionals or academics who leave no street-level footprint.."" a retired anti-terror unit chief said.""Institutional Intelligence (Inst-Int) is another focus area. Chemical supply chains and research labs need monitoring. 'Sectoral observers' need to be in place who can flag anomalies in chemical procurement or shifts in behavior that standard surveillance misses,"" he added. A related setback for the unit is that the ones who primarily maintained sources have either retired, have left the unit on their own or have been shunted out in the last one year.By shifting from reactive gang-level policing to a sophisticated humantechnical fusion, the force can bridge the gap between 20th-century tactics and the 21st-century threats and prevent Delhi from turning into a playground for the next generation of educated, invisible killers.As the smoke clears from the 2025 blast, the message is stark. The 5,178-day streak of peace was also a period of preparation for the enemy. If we are not ready, an 'IM 3.0' would be far more lethal.","""IM 2.0"" was a refined, ""white-collar"" evolution that had learned the hardest lessons of its predecessors.

BANKURA: A 53-year-old booth-level officer (BLO) in Bankura, who was also the headmaster of a primary school, was found hanging on Sunday morning. A note found in the school room where he was hanging read, “I cannot take this pressure anymore, farewell. ”Haradhan Mondal, known locally as Haru master, was a BLO in booth number 206 in the Ranibandh assembly constituency.He left home at 10am telling wife Mala that he needed to collect some documents from voters called for SIR hearings.

BJP Hits Out At Mamata Govt For Stopping Demonstrations Over Bangladesh Violence

KOLKATA: Bengal Police on Sunday issued a warning that loan frauds are using CM Mamata Banerjee’s name and picture to deceive people.Fraudsters are circulating “misleading” advertisements on social media containing the CM’s name and picture “to lure people by offering” instant loans, loans without CIBIL score, guaranteed loans without verification and govt-approved financial schemes, state police mentioned in their X post.Cops clarified that such loan schemes were announced neither by the CM nor by the state govt. Cops have also warned of legal action against the swindlers.“These advertisements, doing the rounds on social media, are fraudulent. The use of the CM’s name and picture is illegal. Stern legal action will be taken against those responsible for impersonation, cheating, cyber fraud and misuse of a public authority’s name and image,” said a police officer.According to police, the fraudsters are circulating advertisements and reels on social media, urging people to download fake apps or redirecting them to fake websites and WhatsApp numbers used by the gang. TurnFraudsters are asking those who are responding to the advertisements to share their personal information such as Aadhaar, PAN, bank details and OTPs.

Officers are advising people not to click on suspicious links or install unverified loan apps. “We are urging people not to fall for such online ads,” an officer said.“People must not share OTPs, bank details or personal details with unknown people.

PARIS: Brigitte Bardot , the French 1960s sex symbol who became one of the greatest screen sirens of the 20th century and later a militant animal rights activist and far-right supporter, has died. She was 91.Bardot died Sunday at her home in southern France, according to Bruno Jacquelin, of the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the protection of animals. He gave no cause of death.Bardot became an international celebrity as a sexualised teen bride in the 1956 movie “And God Created Woman.” Directed by her then-husband, Roger Vadim, it triggered a scandal with scenes of the long-legged beauty dancing on tables naked. At the height of a cinema career that spanned some 28 films and three marriages, Bardot came to symbolise a nation bursting out of bourgeois respectability. Her tousled, blond hair, voluptuous figure and pouty irreverence made her one of France’s best-known stars. Such was her widespread appeal that in 1969 her features were chosen to be the model for “Marianne,” the national emblem of France and the official Gallic seal.“We are mourning a legend,” French President Emmanuel Macron wrote Sunday on X.Bardot’s second career as an animal rights activist was equally sensational. She travelled to the Arctic to blow the whistle on the slaughter of baby seals; she condemned the use of animals in laboratory experiments; and she opposed Muslim slaughter rituals.Later, however, she fell from public grace as her animal protection diatribes took on a decidedly extremist tone. She frequently decried the influx of immigrants into France, especially Muslims. She was convicted and fined five times in French courts of inciting racial hatred, in incidents inspired by her opposition to the Muslim practice of slaughtering sheep during annual religious holidays. Bardot’s 1992 marriage to fourth husband Bernard d’Ormale, a onetime adviser to National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, contributed to her political shift.Bardot was born Sept 28, 1934, to a wealthy industrialist. A shy, secretive child, she studied classical ballet and was discovered by a family friend who put her on the cover of Elle magazine at age 14.But it was French movie producer Vadim, whom she married in 1952, who saw her potential and wrote “And God Created Woman” to showcase her provocative sensuality, an explosive cocktail of childlike innocence and raw sexuality. The film, which portrayed Bardot as a bored newlywed who beds her brother-in-law, had a decisive influence on New Wave directors Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut, and came to embody the hedonism and sexual freedom of the 1960s. The film was a box-office hit, and it made Bardot a superstar. Her girlish pout, tiny waist and generous bust were often more appreciated than her talent.Bardot never adjusted to the limelight. She blamed the constant press attention for the suicide attempt that followed 10 months after the birth of her only child, Nicolas.Among her films were “A Parisian” (1957); “In Case of Misfortune,” (1958); “The Truth” (1960); “Private Life” (1962); “A Ravishing Idiot” (1964); “Shalako” (1968); “Women” (1969); “The Bear And The Doll” (1970); “Rum Boulevard” (1971); and “Don Juan” (1973). With the exception of 1963’s critically acclaimed “Contempt,” directed by Godard, Bardot’s films were rarely complicated by plots. Often they were vehicles to display Bardot in scanty dresses or frolicking nude in the sun.“It was never a great passion of mine,” she said of filmmaking. “And it can be deadly sometimes. Marilyn (Monroe) perished because of it.” Bardot retired to her Riviera villa in St Tropez at the age of 39 in 1973 after “The Woman Grabber.”","Bardot became an international celebrity as a sexualised teen bride in the 1956 movie “And God Created Woman” Directed by her then-husband, Roger Vadim, it triggered a scandal with scenes of the long-legged beauty dancing on tables naked.

PORT SUDAN: For eight days, Sudanese farmer Ibrahim Hussein led his family through treacherous terrain to flee the fighting in southern Kordofan -- the latest and most volatile front in the country's 31-month-old conflict.""We left everything behind,"" said the 47-year-old, who escaped with his family of seven from Keiklek, near the South Sudanese border.""Our animals and our unharvested crops -- all of it.""Hussein spoke to AFP from Kosti, an army-controlled city in White Nile state, around 300 kilometres (186 miles) south of Khartoum.The city has become a refuge for hundreds of families fleeing violence in oil-rich Kordofan, where the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) -- locked in a brutal war since April 2023 -- are vying for control.Emboldened by their October capture of the army's last stronghold in Darfur, the RSF and their allies have in recent weeks descended in full force on Kordofan, forcing nearly 53,000 people to flee, according to the United Nations.""For most of the war, we lived in peace and looked after our animals,"" Hussein said.""But when the RSF came close, we were afraid fighting would break out. So we left, most of the way on foot.""He took his family through the rocky spine of the Nuba Mountains and the surrounding valley, passing through both paramilitary and army checkpoints.This month, the RSF consolidated its grip on West Kordofan -- one of three regional states -- and seized Heglig, which lies on Sudan's largest oil field.With their local allies, they have also tightened their siege on the army-held cities of Kadugli and Dilling, where hundreds of thousands face mass starvation.- Running for their lives -In just two days this week, nearly 4,000 people arrived in Kosti, hungry and terrified, said Mohamed Refaat, Sudan chief of mission for the UN's International Organisation for Migration.""Most of those arriving are women and children. Very few adult men are with them,"" he told AFP, adding that many men stay behind ""out of fear of being killed or abducted.""The main roads are unsafe, so families are taking ""long and uncertain journeys and sleeping wherever they can,"" according to Mercy Corps, one of the few aid agencies operating in Kordofan.""Journeys that once took four hours now force people to walk for 15 to 30 days through isolated areas and mine-littered terrain,"" said Miji Park, interim country director for Sudan.This month, drones hit a kindergarten and a hospital in Kalogi in South Kordofan, killing 114 people, including 63 children, according to the World Health Organisation.Adam Eissa, a 53-year-old farmer, knew it was time to run. He took his wife, four daughters and elderly mother -- all crammed into a pickup truck with 30 others -- and drove for three days through ""backroads to avoid RSF checkpoints"", he told AFP from Kosti.They are now sheltering in a school-turned-shelter housing around 500 displaced people.""We receive some help, but it is not enough,"" said Eissa, who is trying to find work in the market.According to the IOM's Refaat, Kosti -- a relatively small city -- is already under strain. It hosts thousands of South Sudanese refugees, themselves fleeing violence across the border.It cost Eissa $400 to get his family to safety. Anyone who does not have that kind of money -- most Sudanese, after close to three years of war -- has to walk, or stay behind.- Those left behind -According to Refaat, transport prices from El-Obeid in North Kordofan have increased more than tenfold in two months, severely ""limiting who can flee"".In besieged Kadugli, 56-year-old market trader Hamdan is desperate for a way out, ""terrified"" that the RSF will seize the city.""I sent my family away a while ago with my eldest son,"" he told AFP via satellite internet connection, asking to be identified only by his first name. ""Now I am looking for a way to leave.""Every day brings ""the sound of shelling and sometimes gunfire"", said Kassem Eissa, a civil servant and head of a family of eight.""I have three daughters, the youngest is 14,"" he told AFP, laying out an impossible choice: ""Getting out is expensive and the road is unsafe"" but ""we're struggling to get enough food and medicine"".The UN has issued repeated warnings of the violence in Kordofan, raising fears of atrocities similar to those reported in the last captured city in Darfur, including summary executions, abductions and rape.""If a ceasefire is not reached around Kadugli,"" Refaat said, ""the scale of violence we saw in El-Fasher could be repeated.""","Sudanese army and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) fighting for control of oil-rich Kordofan.
