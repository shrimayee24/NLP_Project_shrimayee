Sonam Wangchuk's Wife Blasts Modi Govt & CRPF Over 6Th Schedule, Dismisses FCRA, Pak Link Charges

NEW DELHI: Gitanjali Angmo, wife of education reformer and climate activist Sonam Wangchuk on Wednesday in a representation to the President of India Droupadi Murmu sought her intervention and requested for “unconditional release” of Wangchuk, who she said is a “person who can never be a threat to anyone, leave alone his nation”.“A full scale witch hunt has been unleashed for the past one month in particular, and for the past four years covertly, to kill the spirit of my husband and all the causes he stands for and espouses,” Angmo, who is Founder and CEO of the Himalayan Institute of Alternatives Ladakh (HIAL), states in her representation dated October 1.The copies of the representation have also been sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal and LG of Ladakh.She highlights in her representation to the President that since she was informed about her husband’s detention on September 26 under the National Security Act by the Leh police over phone, she still is completely unaware about her husband's condition. ""I am shocked and devastated,"" she added.""Is it a sin to espouse the cause of people and fight against reckless and unchecked development activities in a ecology fragile area of Ladakh, "" she asks.“Is it a crime to speak about climate change, melting glaciers, educational reforms and grassroot innovation? To raise one's voice for upliftment of a backward tribal belt which is ecologically fragile in a peaceful Gandhian manner for the last four years? It certainly cannot be termed as a threat to national security,” Angmo adds.Appealing to the President to intervene, Angmo states, “You being from a tribal community/background, would understand the feelings of the people of Leh Ladakh better than anyone else.""Wangchuk, who has been at the forefront of the movement seeking statehood and extension of the Sixth Schedule to Ladakh, was detained under NSA for allegedly instigating the violent protests on September 24 and later shifted to a jail in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.Meanwhile, Angmo has alleged in her representation that she was put under CRPF surveillance in Village Phyang, where HIAL is also situated. “Students and staff of the Institute were also put under tight surveillance. Two members of the Institute were taken into police custody over the past 3 days, presumably without any authority of law,” Angmo states“Am I not entitled to meet and speak with my husband on phone and in person where ever he is detained? Can I not be of assistance to my husband to know his ground of detention and to espouse his legal rights of seeking justice before the court of law? Am I not entitled to know the condition of my husband who is in detention?,” she asks.“Apart from the illegal detention of my husband, the manner in which the state and its agencies are hounding us and have kept us under surveillance is deplorable. It is violative of the spirit and ethos of the Constitution of India,” Angmo has alleged.She goes on to appeal to the President as the head of the state to “intervene and inject the voice of sanity in an otherwise chaotic state of affairs. As the President of India, you embody the principles of equity, justice and conscience!”","Wife of education reformer and climate activist Sonam Wangchuk seeks President's intervention.

HYDERABAD: Telangana HC cleared two cops over the 2003 death of a suspect in an alleged encounter, upholding a sessions court’s decision.Justice Juvvadi Sridevi held there was no credible evidence to sustain the charge of murder: “On the contrary, the material indicates the incident occurred in circumstances of private defence while the cops were discharging their official duties. ”HC dismissed an NGO’s plea challenging exoneration of the cops and confirmed dropping of murder charges. The suspect had allegedly stabbed one of the cops in Zaheerabad, 120km from Hyderabad, snatched his rifle and attempted to open fire. In response, another cop, a sub-inspector, shot the suspect, killing him on the spot.Stressing that concerns about ‘police excess’ must be carefully examined, HC said the facts in this instance did not support allegations of murder.","Telangana HC cleared two cops over the 2003 death of a suspect in an alleged encounter.

High court calls wife’s killing ‘classic case of blind faith’

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad high court has convicted an elderly man and an accomplice of strangling his wife to death in 1982 under the pretext of “driving out a ghost”, calling it a shocking case of blind faith used as a cover for murder After a 43-year-long legal battle, a division bench of Justices Rajiv Gupta and Harvir Singh sentenced Awadhesh Kumar, 71, and co-accused Mata Prasad to life imprisonment, overturning a 1984 trial court acquittal.The court also handed them three-year sentences under IPC Section 201 for destroying evidence, saying both terms would run concurrently. Two other accused died while the appeal filed by UP govt was pending.Prosecutors said Kumar killed his 23-year-old wife Kusuma Devi on Aug 6, 1982, after being caught in an illicit relationship with his younger brother’s wife.Kumar, who was then 28 years old, Prasad and two others pinned Kusuma down and throttled her, claiming they were exorcising a ghost.Her body was cremated in a hurry that same night to conceal the crime, according to witness testimony.Calling it “a classic case of blind faith”, the HC said: “Such unfortunate realities are still prevalent in remote areas in different cultures based on superstition and belief, just to bring good fortune and to appease the gods. This shocks the conscience of civilized society and is to be condemned by one and all, to curb such social evils.”Awadhesh Kumar and co-accused Mata Prasad have been ordered to surrender within two weeks.

Trump Reposts PM Modi’s PM Modi’s Message Supporting 20-Point Gaza Peace Plan,Hamas Yet To Respond

.

Where are the people of Gaza themselves in the system of governance proposed? Where is the roadmap for a full-fledged Palestinian state to come into being? How much longer will the US and Israel continue to ignore Palestinian statehood - which has already been recognised by 157 member-countries of the UN with India having led the way in Nov 1988? Where is the accountability for the genocide that has been carried out in Gaza over the past twenty months?

PM Modi welcomes Trump’s Gaza plan:

.

Trump-Netanyahu 20-point plan:

NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Wednesday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for remaining silent on the ongoing Gaza war, calling it extreme “moral cowardice.”In a post on X, Ramesh said, “The PM has maintained a complete silence on the horrific atrocities that have led to the killing of tens of thousands of civilians in Gaza. This is extreme moral cowardice and a total betrayal of all that India has stood for. ”Ramesh alleged that to appease President Donald Trump and in solidarity with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, PM Modi has welcomed Trump’s new 20-point plan for Gaza, while fundamental and disturbing questions about the plan remain.He also raised four fundamental questions on the US-led initiative:Meanwhile, Congress leader Pawan Khera supported Jairam Ramesh’s criticism.In a post on X, he wrote that “any plan that undermines the agency of the long-oppressed Palestinian people and fails to ensure accountability for the genocide they have endured since 2023 is deserving of contempt and condemnation.”Khera added that “true justice can be restored only through the establishment of the Palestinian state” and warned that “everything else is a mere smokescreen to perpetuate the occupation.”On Tuesday, PM Modi welcomed President Trump’s announcement of a comprehensive plan to end the Gaza conflict.In a post on X, he wrote: “We welcome President Donald J Trump's announcement of a comprehensive plan to end the Gaza conflict. It provides a viable pathway to long-term and sustainable peace, security and development for the Palestinian and Israeli people, as also for the larger West Asian region.”The prime minister expressed hope that “all concerned will come together behind President Trump’s initiative and support this effort to end conflict and secure peace.”Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the plan on Monday. The 20-point proposal calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of hostages, protection of civilians on both sides and stronger regional cooperation with international monitoring to ensure compliance. It is unclear whether Hamas will accept the terms.Trump described it as a detailed step-by-step framework aimed at ending the conflict and restoring stability.India was one of the first countries to recognise a Palestinian state in 1988 and also supported a two-state solution at the UN.Since the nearly three-year war began, over 65,000 Palestinians have reportedly been killed, according to Gaza’s health ministry.",Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for remaining silent on the ongoing Gaza war.

MUMBAI: Nineteen years after serial blasts left 31 dead in Malegaon, a special court Tuesday framed charges against four accused, paving the way for the trial to commence.The accused — Lokesh Sharma, Dhan Singh, Rajendra Chaudhary and Manohar Narwaria — pleaded not guilty to charges of criminal conspiracy, murder and terror related charges under the UAPA. The matter will come up for hearing Oct 29.In 2016, nine Muslim men arrested in the case were proved to be innocent and discharged. They were arrested by the first investigating authority, the ATS, in 2006. Subsequently, NIA took over investigations.The four accused were arrested after the NIA alleged that the bombings were the doing of their group.In 2007, a case was registered in the Mecca Masjid bomb blast. In that case, an accused, Swami Aseemanand, allegedly confessed that Sunil Joshi, an RSS functionary, had told him that the bomb blasts at Malegaon were the handiwork of his boys. He allegedly confessed that in June 2006 at the residence of Bharat Rateshwar at Valsad, a meeting was held where he had suggested that Malegaon has an 86% Muslim population and it should be chosen for first blast.NIA was given charge of the case in 2011, following which the four accused were arrested between Dec 2012 and Jan 2013. The NIA chargesheet was filed against the four along with Joshi, Ramchandra Kalsangra, Ramesh and Sandeep Dange.Joshi was allegedly murdered on Dec 29, 2007.The investigating agency alleged that the accused used to congregate at a house where the bombs were prepared between June and July 2006.

It further alleged that the group conducted a reconnaissance of the area three times before finally placing bombs on Sept 8, 2006.","Lokesh Sharma, Dhan Singh, Rajendra Chaudhary and Manohar Narwaria pleaded not guilty to charges of criminal conspiracy, murder and terror related charges.

Israel-Hamas peace plan: Pakistan sending troops to Gaza? Spotlight on 'peacekeeping force',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/israel-hamas-peace-plan-pakistan-sending-troops-to-gaza-spotlight-on-peacekeeping-force/articleshow/124245873.cms,"Hamas, Islamic Jihad Slam Donald Trump’s Gaza Peace Plan As Israeli-Controlled ‘Recipe For War’

Trump's 20-point peace plan







Pakistan’s top leadership may send troops to Gaza as part of a Muslim nations’ peacekeeping force under a comprehensive peace deal announced by US President Donald Trump.The decision was announced by Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday.At a press conference in Islamabad, Dar was asked directly about Pakistan’s role in the initiative, which aims to end the bloodshed in Gaza. “The force [here] is a peacekeeping force. On the ground, there will be Palestinian law-enforcement agencies... there will be [separate] forces supporting them. Indonesia has offered 20,000 troops for that. I am sure Pakistan's leadership will also be making a decision on this,” he said.Dar explained that the idea was to set up an independent Palestinian government of technocrats overseen by an international body. He said Pakistan had asked for the arrangements to be documented at the UN Security Council.He shared that a preparatory meeting of leaders from eight Muslim countries with US President Trump was held in New York last week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. “The objectives were to try for a ceasefire in Gaza, make arrangements for sending humanitarian aid, stop the forced displacement of Palestinians and make arrangements for the return of the displaced Gazans,” he said.Dar added that the plan also included Gaza’s reconstruction and halting Israel’s efforts to annex the West Bank. According to him, Trump proposed that his team work with the foreign ministers of the Muslim nations to create a “workable solution.”The foreign minister said Saudi Arabia had reached out to Pakistan with a draft joint statement on the plan, which was later revised after his input. He noted that the Palestinian Authority welcomed the statement.On Monday, Donald Trump unveiled a 20-point peace plan aimed at ending the Gaza war by demanding Hamas’s disarmament, the immediate release of all hostages within 72 hours, and a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces. Under the proposal, Hamas would be excluded from any future governance; militants willing to abandon arms would receive amnesty, while those wishing to leave Gaza would be allowed safe passage. The plan also involves a temporary technocratic Palestinian committee ruling Gaza under oversight by an international “Board of Peace” led by Trump and including Tony Blair, until the Palestinian Authority is reformed.The initiative calls for humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza without interference from either Israel or Hamas, managed by UN agencies and the Red Crescent, with reconstruction under a “New Gaza” framework. Trump gave Hamas three to four days to accept the plan or face what he called “a very sad end.”","Pakistan's top leadership may send troops to Gaza as part of a Muslim nations' peacekeeping force.

Melvin Eng caught after Ryder Cup stunt spirals out of control



Donald Trump’s Ryder Cup appearance complicated security



A bizarre incident occurred at the Ryder Cup in Farmingdale, New York, when an NYPD detective allegedly disguised himself as part of Donald Trump ’s security team to slip into the tournament. The officer, later identified as Det. Melvin Eng, 46, reportedly managed to bypass tight layers of Secret Service and state police before his plan unraveled in embarrassing fashion. He is now suspended without pay and facing administrative charges.According to multiple reports, Melvin Eng, who was on sick leave at the time, arrived at Bethpage Black in full tactical gear. He claimed he was part of Donald Trump’s detail as the president attended Friday’s opening matches with his granddaughter, Kai.The elaborate ruse nearly worked until Eng dropped a gun magazine in front of actual security personnel. That blunder immediately drew suspicion and ultimately exposed his deception.“He got in there with his gun, past the Secret Service, past the state police,” one law enforcement source said. “What if he was looking to hurt someone?” Another veteran officer added, “You’re out sick, what are you doing at the Ryder Cup? You can’t do that.And it’s theft of service because you went in for free and then you lied and said you worked for Donald Trump.”Eng, who also serves as president of the NYPD Asian Jade Society, has been accused of theft of services and suspended for his actions. Sources told The New York Post that he even went so far as to claim he was working for federal agents.Trump’s presence at Bethpage Black already meant heightened security across the grounds. The president, accompanied by his 18-year-old granddaughter, drew chants of “USA” as he greeted supporters before watching matches from a fortified glass enclosure near the first tee. At one point, he even walked out alongside Bryson DeChambeau to the delight of the pro-American crowd.The measures surrounding Trump’s visit were extensive. Snipers were stationed atop the grandstands, TSA-level checkpoints were set up at multiple entry points, and drones, bomb-sniffing dogs, and chemical detection units were deployed. Even medical staff responding to emergencies faced delays until cleared by authorized personnel. Spectators endured bag checks and bans on electronic devices.Despite these precautions, Eng managed to slip inside. His suspension has raised questions about how he bypassed multiple layers of protection during such a high-security event. The NYPD has yet to release a formal statement on the matter.Also Read: Is Frankie Edgar alright? New Jersey legend suddenly removed from BKFC 82 Newark fight card lineup","Det.

Poll Do you believe the government shutdown will last longer than two weeks? Yes No

Previous US government shutdowns

What programs and payments will stop during US government shutdown





The US government has officially shut down for the first time in six years after a deadlocked Congress failed to pass a funding measure. The full shutdown began at midnight Wednesday, September 30, after Democratic and Republican leaders failed to agree on even a short-term deal to keep the government fully funded past the current fiscal year. So far, it is unclear how long the shutdown will last, or how widespread its impact will be.A key sticking point behind the stalemate is said to be Democrats’ insistence on including the extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits in any stopgap funding bill. Republicans have claimed that Democrats are pushing to provide government benefits to undocumented immigrants. Republicans claim that Democrats want to give health care to ""illegal immigrants."" Democrats say that they are only trying to restore health care coverage options that were available to immigrants having “lawful presence” in the United States before those options were eliminated by President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful” tax bill this year.While so far Elon Musk has not directly commented on the US government shutdown, he has shared/reposted several tweets that support Republican's claim that Democrats want to give health care benefits to ""illegal immigrants”. He quoted VP JD Vance's post on Chuck Schumer rewarding illegal immigrants, and wrote, ""Once Chuck realized that importing voters was a surefire way for Dems to win elections and create a permanent one-party state in America (just like happened in California and New York), he became very much in favor of bribing illegals to come to America!""In his post, JD Vance wrote, ""Chuck Schumer once recognized that it was disastrous to give illegal aliens rewards for breaking the law.Now he wants to shut down the government unless we…reward illegal aliens for breaking the law. x.com/westernlensman…""Elon Musk also shared a Twitter post of White House deputy chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller that says, ""First shutdown in world history to demand free healthcare for illegal aliens.""""In 2019, every Democrat presidential candidate rose their hand in support for healthcare for illegal aliens. Today, Democrats are willing to shut down the government over free healthcare for illegals. Democrats have always put illegals before Americans,"" reads another Tweet reposted by Elon Musk.The American federal government has either shut down or experienced funding gaps 14 times since 1980. The longest shutdown on record occurred in late 2018 and early 2019, lasting 35 days. That partial shutdown was a result of a stalemate over President Donald Trump’s demand for funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.While every government shutdown is unique, they all operate under the same basic principles: non-essential services cease, and many federal employees are furloughed without pay. However, agencies deemed critical for the ""protection of lives and property"" remain operational. These ""essential"" employees, who include air traffic controllers, law enforcement agents, and active-duty military personnel, are required to work but do not receive their paychecks until funding is restored.However, OMB this time is said to be not posting agencies’ shutdown contingency plans on its website. Instead, the plans are hosted only on each agency’s site. This is reported to have made it harder to assess how the Trump administration will handle the shutdown and which activities it will deem essential.","The US government has officially shut down for the first time in six years after a deadlocked Congress failed to pass a funding measure.

South Korea and the United States have reached a preliminary agreement on security, as both countries continue to negotiate trade and tariff issues, according to Yonhap news agency.In an interview published on Thursday, South Korean foreign minister Cho Hyun said that the US is currently reviewing a currency swap deal, a key demand from Seoul in the tariff discussions. However, the minister also hinted that it was not optimistic.Washington had agreed to cut tariffs on South Korean imports in return for a $350 billion investment package. However, talks on the details, including how the investments will be structured, have stalled.Though Cho said that the negotiations were ""actively"" ongoing, South Korea may take longer than Japan to finalise a deal. Japan finalised its investment package last month.Meanwhile, security discussions are advancing in parallel as the two nations continue to explore measures such as boosting South Korea’s defence spending, which is part of the broader plan aimed at reducing US tariffs, Reuters reported. Cho said the aim was to announce the security agreement before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Gyeongju in late October, which US President Donald Trump is expected to attend.Trump said South Korea should shoulder more of its military costs and pay more for US troops stationed there. Responding to this, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Wednesday announced that the country will increase its defence budget by 8.2% next year, highlighting the need for stronger self-defence.""In the security field, an agreement has already been reached in general, which allows us to increase our national defence capabilities in necessary areas,"" Cho told Yonhap.Officials also said progress is being made on granting South Korea more rights to process nuclear fuel for industrial use, a move currently restricted under existing agreements.Cho did not dismiss the possibility of a meeting between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as some ""speculative"" reports cited by Reuters suggested.Last month, North Korea said it would consider negotiations if the US stopped insisting on the complete denuclearisation of the country.","South Korea and the United States have reached a preliminary agreement on security, as both countries continue to negotiate trade and tariff issues.

White House responds to Ariana Grande with sharp remarks

“Save your tears, Ariana. Because President Trump’s actions ended Joe Biden’s inflation crisis and are bringing in trillions in new investment.”

“He even signed an executive order just like magic that paved the way for the FTC to crack down on Ticketmaster for ripping off Ariana Grande’s concert-going fans. Get well soon, Ariana!”

Martina Navratilova, the tennis legend, has sided with Ariana Grande after the singer strongly criticized Donald Trump and his supporters online. On September 29, 2025, Grande posted a long note on Instagram where she asked Trump voters if their lives had really improved in Trump’s second term. She listed issues like high grocery prices, expensive health insurance, immigrant families being separated, and trans people living in fear. Navratilova reshared the post on her X account with heart emojis, showing she fully supported Grande’s tough questions.

'Could have done better': Andrew Cuomo apologizes to Jewish New Yorkers for Covid-19 lockdown rules; 'those decisions caused pain',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/could-have-done-better-andrew-cuomo-apologizes-to-jewish-new-yorkers-for-covid-19-lockdown-rules-those-decisions-caused-pain/articleshow/124268057.cms,"Andrew Cuomo (AP)





Former Governor Andrew Cuomo has issued an apology to Jewish New Yorkers for the Covid-19 lockdown measures he implemented five years ago, which prohibited large gatherings, closed schools, and disrupted religious observances.The apology comes hours before Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, and as Cuomo seeks a political comeback with a mayoral bid.In the video, Cuomo stated that his decisions were aimed at safeguarding the health and safety of New Yorkers during the unprecedented pandemic that claimed roughly 80,000 lives.“However, I recognize some of those decisions caused pain in the Jewish community because we did not always fully consider the sensitivities and traditions that are so deeply important,” Cuomo said in the video, as reported by the New York Post.“We could have done better and for that I’m truly sorry,” he said. “My decision doesn’t change the impact. I sincerely ask for your understanding.”The lockdowns, intended to curb the spread of the highly contagious virus, faced criticism from residents in Brooklyn and Queens’ ultra-Orthodox communities.Orthodox groups perceived the restrictions as disproportionately affecting their communities.Despite this, Jewish political groups, primarily representing Orthodox communities, endorsed Cuomo for mayor on Tuesday, just two days after incumbent Eric Adams withdrew from the race.Community groups and local leaders jointly announced their support for Cuomo, stating, “we believe it is essential to speak with one voice at this critical time,” as reported by the Times of Israel.The statement added, “we are deeply concerned about the direction that mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani would take our city,” citing Mamdani’s comments on policing, his past endorsement of the phrase “globalize the intifada,” and his “socialist policies that we believe would create chaos” and endanger their communities.","Former Governor Andrew Cuomo has issued an apology to Jewish New Yorkers for the Covid-19 lockdown measures he implemented five years ago.

The United States government officially shut down at 12.01 am Wednesday (October 1), leaving citizens with a lot of questions, including whether the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island will be open or not.And the answer is yes, both of them will be open during the partial government shutdown, the Department of the Interior announced on Wednesday, following New York Governor Kathy Hochul's refusal to provide state assistance.“Thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump both Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty remain open for the enjoyment of the American people,” a spokesperson for the Department of the Interior told The New York Post.Ahead of the shutdown, Hochul declined to allocate state funds to maintain operations at the Statue of Liberty. “If Lady Liberty’s iconic torch goes dark, it will be thanks to the Washington Republicans who refused common sense and abandoned the people they were elected to represent,” Hochul said in a statement to The New York Post hours before federal funding expired for the first time since the 35-day shutdown in December 2018 and January 2019.During that previous shutdown, then-Governor Andrew Cuomo utilised state resources to keep the landmark, managed by the National Parks Service, open. “As we’ve done before when Washington’s dysfunction has shut down the govt, New York will step up and ensure the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island remain open for the world to look to for strength and hope during this tumultuous time,” Cuomo, a Democrat, said at that time.Over 3.7 million people visited the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island last year, according to the National Park Service. The complex employs 88 permanent employees, 28 seasonal employees and 80 United States Park Police personnel.","The Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island will be open during the partial government shutdown.

US government shutdown: Trump administration freezes $26 billion for Democratic states- Details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-government-shutdown-trump-administration-freezes-26-billion-for-democratic-states-details/articleshow/124267709.cms,"



US President Donald Trump's administration on Wednesday froze $26 billion for Democratic-leaning states, following through on a threat to use the government shutdown to target Democratic priorities, Reuters reported.The targeted programmes included $18 billion for transit projects in New York, home to Congress's top two Democrats, and $8 billion for green-energy projects in 16 Democratic-run states, including California and Illinois.In a post on X, Vought wrote: “Roughly $18 billion in New York City infrastructure projects have been put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles.”DEI refers to diversity, equity and inclusion policies, which have come under scrutiny by the Trump administration.The funding freeze affects major infrastructure projects such as the Gateway project, a $16 billion effort to build a second rail tunnel under the Hudson River, and the Second Avenue Subway expansion along Manhattan’s East Side. The Hudson River tunnel, long delayed, is designed to ease congestion on the century-old tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey, which carries hundreds of thousands of passengers daily and is crucial for East Coast travel between Boston and Washington.The Trump administration blamed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both from New York City, for the shutdown.Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance signaled that the administration could expand its freeze on federal employees if the shutdown continues for several days.The moves made clear that Trump would carry out his threat to take advantage of the shutdown to punish his political opponents and extend his control over the $7 trillion federal budget, established by the U.S. Constitution as the domain of Congress.","$18 billion for transit projects in New York, home to Congress's top two Democrats. $8 billion for green-energy projects in 16 Democratic-run states.

Why is Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst significant?







A lockdown at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JBMDL) in Burlington County, New Jersey, was lifted around noon on Tuesday after a hoax shooter threat.A lockdown was imposed just before 11 am ET, which lasted approximately one hour following a report of an active shooter at the major US military installation. However, authorities later determined there was no active shooter threat.Base officials an hour later confirmed in a Facebook post stating, “ALL CLEAR. All personnel are to resume normal operations.” The lockdown had been ordered just before 11 am, with an earlier advisory urging personnel outdoors to take cover.“Our priority is the safety and security of everyone on the installation,” Col. Michael Stefanovic, JBMDL commander, said in a statement. “We worked closely with local law enforcement and emergency responders to ensure the situation was investigated and resolved as quickly as possible.”Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, located in central New Jersey, is a key tri-service US military installation, formed in 2009 through the merger of McGuire Air Force Base, Fort Dix, and Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst. Spanning over 42,000 acres across Burlington and Ocean counties, the base supports air mobility, training, and engineering operations critical to national defense.The installation is home to more than 40 units and mission partners, including the Air Force’s 305th Air Mobility Wing, Army Reserve and Guard units, and Navy test and evaluation programs. Its strategic location allows for rapid global deployment of personnel and equipment, while also serving as a central training hub for service members."," lockdown at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst lifted after hoax shooter threat. lockdown was imposed just before 11 am ET, which lasted approximately one hour.

Although unusual for a defendant to appear remotely without video, the court confirmed that the arrangement was requested by the defense, FOX News reported.During the hearing, Robinson and his newly appointed legal counsel indicated their intention to pursue a preliminary hearing, where a judge will decide whether sufficient evidence exists to move forward with a trial.Lead defense attorney Kathy Nester, along with two newly added lawyers, Michael N.

How common and lengthy are government shutdowns?

The United States government officially shut down at 12:01 am Wednesday (October 1) after Congress and Republicans failed to reach a funding deal, and now the stalemate may stay for at least three days.The Senate is expected to commence its next rounds of voting on government funding after 1.30 pm on Friday, according to Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso. Votes on competing proposals from Democrats and Republicans are planned.The Senate has adjourned until noon on Thursday and will resume voting on Friday. Senators will not vote on Thursday in recognition of the Yom Kippur holiday, which begins at sundown on Wednesday.""We will be in session tomorrow, starting tomorrow afternoon. So the floor will be available if people want to give speeches,"" Thune said, adding that he expected it to be ""fairly quiet around here"" because of the Jewish holiday.The last government shutdown — from December 2018 to January 2019 — was the longest in US history, stretching 35 days.It began on December 22, 2018, when Democrats refused to meet President Trump’s demand for border wall funding.Mounting pressure — including widespread travel delays caused by air traffic controllers calling out sick — forced Trump to back down. On Jan. 25, 2019, he agreed to a temporary deal to reopen the government without wall funding. The five-week standoff cost the US an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Since 1976, there have been 20 funding gaps, though most were short. Ten since 1981 lasted three days or fewer, often over weekends. The most consequential shutdowns came in the 1990s, when clashes between President Bill Clinton and Speaker Newt Gingrich over balancing the budget closed the government for five days in November 1995 and then for 21 days through early 1996. Republicans, widely blamed in polls, eventually accepted Clinton’s terms.The next major standoff came in 2013, when House Republicans refused to pass a spending bill funding the Affordable Care Act. The 16-day shutdown ended only after bipartisan Senate talks produced minor concessions. A 2023 congressional report estimated it reduced GDP growth by $20 billion and cost $2 billion in lost work hours.Shutdowns only became possible after a pair of legal opinions from US Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti in 1980–81. Interpreting the Antideficiency Act, Civiletti concluded federal employees could not work without appropriations, except in limited cases involving safety or property. His rulings, he later admitted, unintentionally set the stage for shutdowns to become a recurring political weapon.Since then, there have been eight shutdowns in the 1980s, three in the 1990s, and three more in the 2000s — nearly all brief. But the modern era has seen longer, costlier showdowns, with public blame typically split between both parties.","Since 1976, there have been 20 funding gaps, though most were short.

The Trump administration has warned that mass layoffs of 'nonessential' federal employees could begin within days if the ongoing US government shutdown continues.At a White House press briefing on Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt announced that federal layoffs are imminent, slamming Democrats for the looming cuts. “We believe layoffs are imminent. They are, unfortunately, a consequence of this government shutdown,” she told reporters.“Sometimes you have to do things you don’t want to do and it’s because the Democrats have put us in this position. If the Democrats did not vote to shut down the government, we would not be talking about layoffs today.”Leavitt stated that President Donald Trump and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russ Vought are working with agencies “across the board” to identify where cuts may be implemented.However, she did not state a specific percentage of layoffs that will occur. She also did not state a specific day when the layoffs would happen, but simply said it would occur ""soon.""Leavitt confirmed that Vought will discuss the layoffs with members of the House Republican Conference to prepare them for constituent backlash. “It would be irresponsible of us not to take a look at each and every agency and get an understanding of what we’re going to have to do moving forward to do the best we can in the midst of this government shutdown,” she added.Vice President JD Vance, who joined the briefing at the White House, stressed that “nonessential” employees would be the first to lose their jobs if the standoff persists. “We’re not targeting federal agencies based on politics. We’re targeting the people’s government so that as much as possible of the essential services can continue to function,” he said. Vance added that the administration would “have to save money in some places so the essential services don’t get turned off in other places. ”Nonessential employees are generally those whose roles are not vital to national security or public health. They include administrative personnel, staff at national parks and museums, certain research positions,The remarks came a day after President Trump said he would use the shutdown to fire “a lot” of civil servants and cut federal programs and benefits he opposes.The US government officially entered shutdown at 12:01 am Wednesday after lawmakers failed to reconcile competing spending bills. Republicans have blamed Democrats’ health care demands for the deadlock, while Democrats insist the GOP must return to the negotiating table.","White House says mass layoffs of 'nonessential' federal employees could begin within days if the ongoing US government shutdown continues.

The Commonwealth Observer Group (COG) has officially released its report on Pakistan’s 2024 general elections, noting “conditions that appeared to impact one party’s ability to fairly contest the election” — namely the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), led by incarcerated former Prime Minister Imran Khan The report, which included a ""Letter of Transmittal"" by COG chairperson and former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, cited the denial to PTI of its election symbol, Khan’s consecutive convictions ahead of polling, and restrictions on freedom of association and assembly.Jonathan wrote: “When looked at in isolation, some – though not all – of the arguments advanced by key institutions in support of their actions appear somewhat justifiable. Yet, collectively, it could not go unnoticed that these decisions consistently limited one party's ability to contest the election on a level playing field.”The observers expressed particular concern over the Supreme Court of Pakistan’s revocation of PTI’s iconic “bat” symbol — linked to Khan’s cricketing past — on grounds that the party failed to hold intra-party elections. With the decision coming just weeks before polling, PTI candidates were forced to run as independents, depriving them of a unifying symbol.The group also flagged Khan’s multiple convictions shortly before polling day, along with restrictions on PTI’s rallies and gatherings. “There were also limitations on fundamental political rights, including freedom of association and assembly. These limitations were felt most acutely by PTI and its supporters,” the report said.The COG called for reforms to strengthen transparency and ensure a level playing field for all parties in future Pakistani elections.The report found that mainstream English-language media “broadly followed the principles of fair and accurate election reporting,” though PTI-affiliated independent candidates received ""less positive"" coverage.By contrast, state-owned PTV News lacked balance, focusing mainly on the ruling PML-N and PPP, and reportedly barred references to Khan by name. The group concluded that these factors may have “impinged on the credibility, transparency and inclusiveness of the electoral process.”The report had been controversial after media reports suggested the Commonwealth had “buried” it following widespread problems in the February 8 polls. Submitted to the Commonwealth secretary-general on November 20, 2024, the publication was delayed without explanation.The PTI had repeatedly demanded its release, arguing it confirmed “systemic rigging, institutional bias, and deliberate targeting” of the party and its founder.","Commonwealth Observer Group releases report on Pakistan's 2024 general elections.

At least nine people, including four militants, were killed in two separate bomb-related incidents on Tuesday in South Waziristan district of Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, reported news agency PTI.The first explosion occurred in Ashangi Lagad village, where five villagers were killed instantly after coming into contact with a bomb-like object lying on the road.The powerful blast sparked panic in the area, with residents demanding that authorities step up efforts to clear unexploded devices and protect civilians. Security forces and local administration officials later reached the site and launched an investigation.Hours later, in the Wacha Khawora area of Wana, four militants were killed when an improvised explosive device (IED) they were attempting to plant went off prematurely. Among those killed were a local militant commander, Yar Muhammad Muslim, Zameed Alam of the Ashangi tribe, and two unidentified associates.Earlier, at least ten people were killed and several others injured when a powerful car bomb exploded outside the paramilitary headquarters in Quetta on Tuesday.The blast was reportedly heard miles away, and ambulances quickly arrived to transport the wounded to nearby hospitals.“The blast occurred as an explosive-laden vehicle took a turn from Model Town towards Hali Road, near the Frontier Constabulary (FC) headquarters,” said Muhammad Baloch, SSP special operations Quetta.This follows heightened tensions in the region.

Pakistan-occupied Jammu Kashmir (PoJK) is witnessing rising unrest as Shaukat Nawaz Mir, head of the Neelum Valley Public Action Committee, announced a full-scale shutdown to press for public demands.Authorities have warned that any attempt to carry out the strike will be met with force, reported ANI.The announcement follows months of mounting dissatisfaction among citizens who feel ignored by the local administration. Businesses, markets, and transport services are expected to close, potentially bringing daily life across the region to a standstill.Lawyers and civil society organisations have expressed support for the shutdown, calling it a legitimate democratic right, urging the government to address long-standing grievances rather than suppress public dissent.Citizens have long complained about inadequate healthcare, poor education, failing infrastructure, and lack of access to clean water, while public resources are often diverted for political patronage and bribery.The strike reflects widespread frustration over government neglect and systemic corruption.Activists are calling for accountability, transparency in fund allocation, and an end to corrupt practices tied to reserved political seats and local governance programs.""Public demands must be met, not crushed,"" a senior lawyer in Muzaffarabad stated, as quoted by ANI, adding that the legal community would stand in solidarity with the protestors.","Authorities have warned that any attempt to carry out the strike will be met with force.

: In an effort to worm its way back into Washington’s good books, Pakistan ’s hybrid military-civilian leadership flashed glimpses of its purported rare earths bearing mineral wealth during a meeting with US President Donald Trump last week, going by a photo released by the White House.Among a dozen photos featured in the White House picture gallery relating to the Shahbaz Sharif- Asim Munir meeting with Trump is one where the duo is showing Trump an open 18x18 inch wooden box with colorful stones presumably bearing some mineral deposits. Two of the larger rocks appear to be bastanzite and monazite clumps that typically bear rare earths elements (REE) such as cerium, lanthanum, and neodymium. Some of the smaller candy-colored pebbles look like gemstones.Pakistan has long spoken of its vast untapped oil, gas, and mineral ores, some bearing rare earths, mostly in the troubled Balochistan region wracked with insurgency, and also in Khyber-Pakhtoonwa. While none of the mineral deposits are commercially proven or quantified, Pakistan’s leadership showcased the baubles to the US President to highlight collaboration and exploration bids it has signed with a private US firm earlier this month.The charm offensive also included PM Sharif wearing a lapel pin the had both the US and Pakistani flags, a gesture some Pakistani trolls on social media termed as “embarrassing.”While there is no direct government-to-government agreement to explore or exploit the mineral wealth, Pakistan's Frontier Works Organization (FWO)—a military-linked engineering and mining entity—signed an MoU on September 8 with the Missouri-based US Strategic Metals (USSM), a private US firm specializing in critical minerals.The agreement, with an initial funding of $ 500 million from USSM, envisages three phases: Phase 1 (Immediate, 2025–2026) involving export of readily available minerals (e.g., antimony and copper concentrates) to US markets, generating quick revenue. Phase 2 (Medium-term, 2026–2028) involving construction of processing plants and refineries in Pakistan, with technology transfer for REE separation and purification. Phase 3 (Long-term, 2028+), involving large-scale exploration and exploitation, including drilling in high-potential REE belts; and developing 5–10 mining projects.Islamabad's rare earths gambit with the US — which could cause Pakistan's patron China to burst a blood vessel since it has a stranglehold on rare earths supply to the US — comes on the heels of the its crypto caper, where it used a British-Pakistani entrepreneur to position itself as crypto capital where American businesses with ties to the Trump family could make a fortune.","Pakistan has long spoken of its vast untapped oil, gas, and mineral ores, some bearing rare earths.
