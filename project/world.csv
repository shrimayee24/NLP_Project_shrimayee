'Politically wounded PM': Justin Trudeau keeps Canada guessing on resignation amid growing pressure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/politically-wounded-pm-justin-trudeau-keeps-canada-guessing-on-resignation-amid-growing-pressure/articleshow/116912366.cms,"Growing pressure to resign



(Data: Agnus Reid Institute)

Conservative Party garner nearly 50% support



'Politically wounded PM'



Will he quit or not? The suspense over Justin Trudeau's resignation has kept Canada on edge amid growing pressure from his own party.Trudeau has maintained a notably low profile since December 16, when his key cabinet member and finance minister Chrystia Freeland stepped down. Her departure was particularly impactful, as she released a critical public letter expressing her dissatisfaction with his leadership. The resignation of this once-influential ally dealt a significant blow to his administration.The PM spent much of the holidays at a ski resort in western Canada and is not planning any official events or appearances by the end of the week, a person familiar with his schedule told Bloomberg. He has given no public indication yet of when he’ll announce a decision about his future.Meanwhile, Liberal Party members are intensifying pressure on him to resign as polling numbers continue to decline. A recent Nanos Research survey conducted during the holidays indicates the Conservative Party's growing advantage as elections approach.According to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Liberal caucus members from Quebec, the prime minister's home province, have requested his departure, following similar appeals from Ontario. Several Liberal MPs have openly expressed their stance, including Toronto's Rob Oliphant, who published a letter requesting a ""new leader elected through a robust, open leadership contest.""Representatives from Atlantic provinces emphasised the urgency of leadership change, citing concerns about Donald Trump's potential return to power. Kody Blois, representing Liberal members from eastern provinces, warned about possible economic instability, particularly regarding potential US tariffs on Canadian imports.“The country could face instability, notably from an economic threat in the potential of a 25 per cent US tariff on Canadian imports from the incoming administration,” Blois said. “Simply put, time is of the essence,” and that it’s “not tenable” for Trudeau to stay,"" he added.The latest survey from Nanos Research, released on December 31, showed the Conservatives leading by 26 points over the Liberals. The poll indicated Conservative support at 46.6 per cent over the Liberals' 21 per cent. Jagmeet Singh's NDP were not far behind, sitting at 17 per cent support.""Conservative support hits a new long-term high with a 26-point advantage over the Liberals. This has occurred alongside calls for Trudeau to step down. Worry about jobs/economy has also hit a new four-year high,"" Nik Nanos, founder of Nanos Research, said.Nanos suggested that Trudeau's prolonged indecision also risked sparking internal party dissent. He noted that the issue has evolved from personal reputation damage to potentially harming the entire party's standing.Current polling suggests the Liberals could face significant seat losses from their 153 positions. While the party has begun pre-election advertising focusing on social programme preservation, leadership transition presents challenges.The government's parliamentary position remains unstable, with opposition parties ready to vote ""no confidence"" when the House reconvenes in late January. A leadership contest could take three months, leaving little preparation time before a national campaign.Though Trudeau could remain in office during a leadership race, Nanos suggested this could weaken Canada's position in international negotiations.“A politically wounded prime minister is not really in a very strong position to negotiate anything with someone like Donald Trump,” Nanos said.The Liberal Party, historically dominant in Canadian federal politics since World War II, faces significant challenges in 2025.Their lowest electoral performance was in 2011, securing 19 per cent of votes and 34 of 308 seats. Trudeau's leadership subsequently revived the party, but current circumstances suggest potential significant losses in the upcoming election.","Liberal Party members are intensifying pressure on him to resign as polling numbers continue to decline.

Las Vegas Cybertruck explosion: 'Wife left Matthew Livelsberger days before blast' — Was it political motive or personal struggles?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/las-vegas-cybertruck-explosion-wife-left-matthew-livelsberger-days-before-blast-was-it-political-motive-or-personal-struggles/articleshow/116898874.cms,"Livelsberger’s wife had reportedly broken up with him over infidelity allegations before he killed himself. (Facebook / Matt Berg)

A marriage in crisis

Intentions under scrutiny

A soldier’s final struggle

Questions remain

On New Year’s Day, Las Vegas witnessed a bizarre and tragic incident when Matthew Livelsberger , a 37-year-old Army Special Forces soldier , detonated a Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump International Hotel before taking his own life inside the vehicle. As details emerge, investigators are now reportedly considering whether his actions were fueled by personal turmoil rather than political motives.Livelsberger’s downward spiral began just days before Christmas. According to law enforcement sources, his wife confronted him over alleged infidelity, leading to a heated argument that ended their relationship. Six days later, Livelsberger left their Colorado Springs home, leaving behind his wife and their infant daughter, reported the New York Post sources.“He loved his family, but he was clearly struggling,” a source familiar with the case revealed.Renting a Tesla Cybertruck through the Turo app, Livelsberger made his way to Las Vegas. Early New Year’s morning, he parked the electric truck outside the Trump hotel, detonated explosives stored inside, and fatally shot himself.The location and method of the attack initially led investigators to suspect political motives. The Trump International Hotel, tied to President-elect Donald Trump, and the Tesla vehicle, manufactured by Trump ally Elon Musk, seemed like deliberate choices.“It’s not lost on us that it happened in front of the Trump building and a Tesla vehicle was used,” said Spencer Evans, FBI special agent in charge of the investigation.However, Livelsberger’s history as a “Rambo-type patriot” and staunch Trump supporter has complicated this theory. Sources now suggest he may have intentionally chosen the Cybertruck for its unique design, which limited the blast radius and minimized potential casualties.“If he had used a regular car, the explosion would have likely shattered the building’s glass doors and endangered people in the lobby,” one source explained.Musk himself commented on the incident via Twitter: “The evil knuckleheads picked the wrong vehicle for a terrorist attack. Cybertruck actually contained the explosion and directed the blast upwards. Not even the glass doors of the lobby were broken.”Seven people suffered minor injuries from the blast, while Livelsberger’s body was burned beyond recognition. He was later identified through his passport and Army ID found in the truck.Livelsberger was a decorated soldier, having served in Afghanistan in 2017 and 2018. Known for his patriotism and commitment to the military, he was described by his uncle, Dean Livelsberger, as “a very, very patriotic American.”“He loved Trump, and he was always a very patriotic soldier,” his uncle told The Independent.Despite his military accolades, Livelsberger’s personal life seemed to unravel in the weeks leading up to his death. Law enforcement is now investigating whether his actions were a desperate attempt to reconcile internal conflict rather than a calculated political statement.As investigators piece together Livelsberger’s final days, his actions remain a puzzle. Was his choice of location and vehicle a deliberate act of symbolism, or merely coincidental? And was his ultimate motive driven by heartbreak, ideology, or something else entirely?For now, Livelsberger’s tragic end leaves behind a grieving family, a shocked nation, and a trail of unanswered questions.","Matthew Livelsberger, a 37-year-old Army Special Forces soldier, detonated a Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump International Hotel on New Year's Day.

Hush money case: Donald Trump dismisses sentencing before January 20 inauguration as 'illegitimate political attack',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hush-money-case-donald-trump-dismisses-sentencing-before-january-20-inauguration-as-illegitimate-political-attack/articleshow/116930781.cms,"Donald Trump waits for the start of proceedings in Manhattan criminal court, April 23, 2024, in New York. (AP)

US President-elect Donald Trump criticized a judge's decision to schedule his sentencing in the hush money trial for January 10, just ten days before his January 20 inauguration.Trump, on his Truth Social platform, called the decision an ""illegitimate political attack"", describing it as a ""Rigged Charade.""Earlier, judge Juan Merchan upheld Trump’s conviction on Friday, rejecting motions from Trump’s lawyers to overturn the New York jury’s decision. The judge said that Trump could appear in person or virtually for the sentencing and indicated that he was not likely to impose jail time. Instead, Merchan said he was inclined toward an unconditional discharge, which would impose no conditions on Trump’s release. This would mean Trump would enter office as a convicted felon.Trump responded on Truth Social, saying, ""This lawless case should have never been brought,"" and criticized the judge as a ""radical partisan."" He added that the decision was ""knowingly unlawful"" and ""goes against our Constitution.""Trump’s spokesperson, Steven Cheung, also denounced the sentencing, calling it a violation of Supreme Court precedent on presidential immunity . Cheung stated, ""President Trump must be allowed to continue the Presidential Transition process and to execute the vital duties of the presidency, unobstructed.""Trump, who is 78, was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential election. He potentially faced up to four years in prison, but legal experts had already anticipated that incarceration was unlikely. Judge Merchan confirmed that prosecutors did not recommend a jail sentence.In an 18-page decision, Merchan said, “It seems proper at this juncture to make known the Court's inclination to not impose any sentence of incarceration.” He also noted that once Trump is sworn in as president, he would gain immunity from prosecution. ""Finding no legal impediment to sentencing and recognizing that Presidential immunity will likely attach once Defendant takes his Oath of Office, it is incumbent upon this Court to set this matter down for imposition of sentence prior to January 20, 2025,"" Merchan wrote.Trump’s attorneys have said they plan to appeal, which could delay the sentencing. Merchan rejected their argument that the case should be dismissed based on a Supreme Court decision granting former presidents immunity for official acts. The judge also said that sentencing must occur before Trump takes office, as presidential immunity would prevent further prosecution after January 20.In addition to this case, Trump has faced other legal challenges, including two federal cases brought by special counsel Jack Smith, which were dropped under Justice department policy protecting sitting presidents. Trump also faces charges in Georgia related to alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election, though those proceedings would likely pause while he is in office.","US President-elect Donald Trump criticized a judge's decision to schedule his sentencing in the hush money trial for January 10, just ten days before his January 20 inauguration.

How did this 7-year-old boy brave lions and leopards for five days in a Zimbabwe zoo?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/how-did-this-7-year-old-boy-brave-lions-and-leopards-for-five-days-in-a-zimbabwe-zoo/articleshow/116930567.cms,"A seven-year-old boy was rescued after spending five days lost in the dense and predator-rich Matusadona National Park in northern Zimbabwe .The wildlife authority, ZimParks, confirmed the miraculous incident on Friday.Tinotenda Pundu, a young boy from a village bordering the vast reserve, disappeared into the park on December 27. The Matusadona National Park, known for its landscapes and thriving wildlife, is equally notorious for its treacherous terrain and apex predators, including lions, leopards, and buffaloes. Many who wander into its depths often do not return.Rangers, locals, and police initiated a frantic search for Tinotenda, but heavy rains hampered their efforts. On December 30, his footprints were discovered, reigniting hope. Early the next day, Tinotenda was found approximately 50 kilometers (about 30 miles) from his village, a testament to his remarkable survival instincts.“Remarkably, it is estimated that he walked through the harsh terrain of the lion-infested Matusadona National Park for 49 kilometers,” ZimParks spokesperson Tinashe Farawo said in a statement. Tinotenda survived by foraging for wild fruits and digging into riverbanks to find water, a survival technique familiar to communities in Zimbabwe’s drought-prone regions.Mutsa Murombedzi, a local lawmaker, described the boy’s survival as a miracle. “He was clever enough to sleep on perched rocks, keeping himself out of reach of lions and other wildlife,” she told AFP.Villagers had tried to lure Tinotenda back by playing drums, hoping he would follow the sound, but it was the rangers’ expertise that ultimately led to his rescue.The boy, frail but unharmed, was immediately admitted to a hospital. Matusadona National Park, nestled near Lake Kariba, spans approximately 1,470 square kilometers (570 square miles) and has long been a sanctuary for diverse wildlife.According to the nonprofit African Parks, the reserve once boasted the highest density of lions in Africa and served as a crucial stronghold for elephants and black rhinos. However, for those like Tinotenda, who inadvertently venture too deep, the park’s beauty can quickly turn perilous.","Tinotenda Pundu, a young boy from a village bordering the vast reserve, disappeared into the park on December 27.

Paetongtarn's father's wealth

Former PM's assets

'Money plays a crucial role in political activities'

Thailand's Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Friday declared over $400 million in assets, which include more than 200 designer handbags, 75 luxury watches, and more. Her political party confirmed the declaration, which was filed with the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC).The declaration shows Paetongtarn possesses assets totaling 13.8 billion baht (approximately $400 million), according to an AFP report. This includes investments worth 11 billion baht, and an additional one billion baht in cash and deposits. Her assets also include 75 watches valued at 162 million baht, another 39 timepieces, and 217 handbags worth 76 million baht. She also owns property in London and Japan.According to a document from the NACC shared by local media, she also reported liabilities of nearly five billion baht, resulting in a net worth of 8.9 billion baht ($258 million).Paetongtarn, the daughter of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra , assumed office in September. She is the fourth member of her family to lead the Thai government in the past two decades.Paetongtarn's father, Thaksin, has an estimated net worth of $2.1 billion, making him the 10th-richest person in Thailand, according to Forbes. Thaksin once owned Manchester City football club.Thaksin leveraged the wealth from his Shin Corp telecommunications empire to enter politics, and his family has continued to hold significant influence, even during his years in exile after being overthrown in a coup.Paetongtarn's predecessor, Srettha Thavisin , had declared assets of 985 million baht when dismissed from office in August. This was a decrease from his initial declaration of 1.02 billion baht at the start of his term.Yuttaporn Issarachai, an analyst from Sukhothai Thammathirat University, said that there is a vital relationship between wealth and politics in Thailand.""In a nation without a fully functioning democracy, money plays a crucial role in political activities. This has often been the justification for military interventions, with claims of a lack of transparency,"" Issarachai said.","Thailand's Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra declared over $400 million in assets.

A decorated US Army soldier, Matthew Livelsberger , fatally shot himself in a Tesla Cybertruck shortly before it exploded near the Trump hotel in Las Vegas on New Year’s Day. Investigators said on Friday that Livelsberger left notes saying the explosion was meant as a ""wake-up call"" about the country’s problems.Livelsberger, a 37-year-old Green Beret from Colorado Springs, Colorado, served in the US Army since 2006 and deployed twice to Afghanistan. In notes found on his cellphone, he wrote that he needed to ""cleanse"" his mind of the brothers he had lost and relieve himself of the burden of lives he had taken.He also described the explosion as a spectacle meant to draw attention to societal issues, writing, ""This was not a terrorist attack"", adding, ""Americans only pay attention to spectacles and violence. What better way to get my point across than a stunt with fireworks and explosives?""The explosion caused minor injuries to seven people and did not damage the Trump International Hotel. Authorities stated that Livelsberger acted alone. His notes mentioned a range of topics, including political grievances, societal problems, and issues such as the war in Ukraine. In one note, he said that the US was ""terminally ill and headed toward collapse.""Assistant Sheriff Dori Koren of the Las Vegas metropolitan police department said Tesla engineers helped investigators access data from the Cybertruck, including Livelsberger’s travel path from Colorado to Las Vegas. Investigators are still reviewing a large amount of data, including videos, photos, documents, and web history.Officials said Livelsberger did not harbor ill will toward US President-elect Donald Trump. In one note, he called for the country to ""rally around"" Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Neither Trump nor Musk was in Las Vegas at the time of the explosion.FBI Special Agent Spencer Evans described the incident as a suicide by a combat veteran struggling with PTSD and other challenges. Livelsberger died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Investigators have not yet explained how he managed to shoot himself while igniting the explosives in the Cybertruck.Items found inside the vehicle included two firearms, fireworks, a passport, a military ID, credit cards, and electronic devices. Both guns were legally purchased.Livelsberger had confided to a former girlfriend, Alicia Arritt, about physical and mental health struggles, which she attributed to traumatic brain injury, news agency AP reported. Arritt shared text messages where Livelsberger described his pain and exhaustion, saying his life had become difficult.Livelsberger, who served in Afghanistan, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia, and Congo, had recently returned from Germany and was on approved leave at the time of his death. He was awarded five Bronze Stars, a combat infantry badge, and an Army Commendation Medal with valor.Authorities also searched his home in Colorado Springs. Neighbours said he lived there with his wife and baby and described him as a typical neighbour.The explosion occurred hours after another incident in New Orleans, where Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar drove a truck into a crowd, killing at least 14 people.

South Korea in political crisis after president resists arrest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/south-korea-in-political-crisis-after-president-resists-arrest/articleshow/116930444.cms,"Members of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions shout slogans demanding arrest of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol in Seoul, South Korea, Friday, January 3, 2025.

SEOUL: South Korea's political leadership was in uncharted territory Saturday after the sitting president resisted arrest over a failed martial law decree days before the warrant expires.In scenes of high drama on Friday, Yoon Suk Yeol's presidential guards and military troops shielded the former star prosecutor from investigators, who called off their arrest attempt citing safety concerns.The South Korean president was impeached and suspended last month after the bungled martial law declaration -- a political move swiftly overturned by parliament -- with a separate warrant later issued for his arrest.""There was a standoff. While we estimated the personnel blocking us to be around 200, there could have been more,"" an official from the investigation team said Friday on condition of anonymity.""It was a dangerous situation.""Yoon faces criminal charges of insurrection, one of a few crimes not subject to presidential immunity, meaning he could be sentenced to prison or, at worst, the death penalty.If carried out, the warrant would make Yoon the first sitting president ever arrested.Since his impeachment, Yoon has holed up in his presidential residence in the capital Seoul, where he has refused to emerge for questioning three times.The unprecedented showdown -- which reportedly included clashes but no shots fired -- left the arrest attempt by investigators in limbo with the court-ordered warrant set to expire on Monday.Officials from the Corruption Investigation Office (CIO), which is probing Yoon over his martial law decree, said there could be another bid to arrest him before then.But if the warrant lapses, they would have to apply for another from the same Seoul court that issued the initial summons.The Constitutional Court slated January 14 for the start of Yoon's impeachment trial, which if he does not attend would continue in his absence.Former presidents Roh Moo-hyun and Park Geun-hye never appeared for their impeachment trials.Yoon's lawyers decried Friday's arrest attempt as ""unlawful and invalid"", and vowed to take legal action.Experts said investigators could wait for greater legal justification before attempting to arrest the suspended president again.""It may be challenging to carry out the arrest until the Constitutional Court rules on the impeachment motion and strips him of the presidential title,"" Chae Jin-won of Humanitas College at Kyung Hee University told AFP.- 'Stable path' -South Korean media reported that CIO officials had wanted to arrest Yoon and take him to their office in Gwacheon near Seoul for questioning.After that, he could have been held for up to 48 hours on the existing warrant. Investigators would have needed to apply for another arrest warrant to keep him in custody.Yoon has remained defiant despite the political impasse he initiated with his December 3 decree.He told his right-wing supporters this week he would fight ""to the very end"" for his political survival.By the time investigators attempted to execute the warrant for Yoon's arrest, he had layered his presidential compound with hundreds of security forces to prevent it.Around 20 investigators and 80 police officers were heavily outnumbered by around 200 soldiers and security personnel linking arms to block their way after entering the presidential compound.A tense six-hour standoff ensued until early Friday afternoon when the investigators were forced to U-turn for fear of violence breaking out.The weeks of political turmoil have threatened the country's stability.South Korea's key security ally, the United States, called for the political elite to work towards a ""stable path"" forward.National Security Council spokesman John Kirby reaffirmed Washington's commitment to maintaining bilateral ties and readiness to respond to ""any external provocations or threats"".Outgoing US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is scheduled to hold talks in Seoul on Monday, with one eye on the political crisis and another on nuclear-armed neighbour North Korea.","Yoon Suk Yeol's presidential guards and military troops shielded the former star prosecutor from investigators.

'Morgan fought me for three years'

US President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday announced that former state department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus will serve as deputy special presidential envoy for Middle East Peace during his second administration. She will be working under Steven Witkoff , Trump's nominee for special envoy to the Middle East.Trump announced the appointment of Ortagus on his Truth Social platform.""I am pleased to announce Morgan Ortagus as Deputy Special Presidential Envoy for Middle East Peace, to the Honorable Steven Witkoff,"" Trump said in his post.Morgan Ortagus has a background in diplomacy and national security and currently serves as an active US navy reserve intelligence officer.Between 2019 and 2021, she was the spokesperson at the department of state under Mike Pompeo, where she contributed to the historic Abraham Accords, which achieved unparalleled peace in the Middle East, according to Trump.Before her role at the state department, she served as a financial intelligence analyst at the department of the treasury and, from 2010 to 2011, was the deputy US treasury attaché to Saudi Arabia.""Morgan Ortagus has had experience in Diplomacy and National Security, and is an active US Navy Reserve Intelligence Officer.

These things usually don’t work out, but she has strong Republican support, and I’m not doing this for me, I’m doing it for them.

(Photos: New York Post)

A Quran open to violence

A chaotic scene at home

A house of red flags

A veteran’s downfall

Shamsud-Din Jabbar , a 42-year-old New Orleans terrorist who pledged allegiance to Isis, left behind a chilling scene in his North Houston trailer home—complete with bomb-making materials , a Quran open to a passage glorifying violence, and signs of a life spiraling into chaos.On New Year’s Day, Jabbar drove a rented Ford F-150 Lightning into the heart of Bourbon Street , mowing down revelers at 3 am in a gruesome rampage. Fourteen people were killed, dozens injured, and Jabbar himself died in a shootout with police. Federal investigators have ruled it an act of terrorism The video posted by the New York Post showed a workbench in Jabbar’s bedroom set up for assembling explosives. Nearby, his Quran stood prominently atop a bookshelf, opened to Verse 9:111, which reads: “They fight in Allah’s cause, and slay and are slain; a promise binding…” The verse, widely interpreted as a call to violence by extremist ideologies, cast a haunting shadow over his already sinister acts.This passage, investigators believe, fueled Jabbar’s radicalization . It was the same ideology he embraced in chilling videos posted online minutes before his attack, where he declared his allegiance to Isis and issued threats, including to his own family.The aftermath of the FBI raid on Jabbar’s trailer painted a picture of a man living on the edge. The home was in disarray, with the front door kicked down, cabinets flung open, and furniture overturned.His main bedroom held a keffiyeh in the closet and bomb-making tools on the workbench—ominous signs of his dark turn. Despite the mess, the home seemed eerily as if he had just left, with clothes and belongings scattered about.Jabbar’s trailer home painted a grim portrait of his descent into extremism . Chemical residues and bottles filled the property, with an inventory left behind by FBI agents listing compounds commonly used in bomb-making. A rolled-up prayer rug and numerous Islamic books further hinted at his radicalization.Yet, the home also bore traces of his fragmented personal life. A back bedroom was cluttered with children’s toys and bunk beds—remnants of his role as a father to two daughters, aged 15 and 20.Hours before his attack, Jabbar told neighbors he was leaving for New Orleans for a new IT job. The lie was soon laid bare as the same white truck he drove off in became his weapon of mass destruction.Once an Army staff sergeant, Jabbar served ten years, including deployments to Afghanistan from 2009 to 2019. But after leaving active duty in 2015 and the reserves in 2020, his life unraveled. Financial woes from two divorces, a failed real estate career, and struggles as an IT specialist marked his civilian years.Despite his quiet demeanor, Jabbar’s radicalization had alarming roots. In videos posted before his attack, he not only declared loyalty to Isis but also threatened to murder his own family. His younger brother, Abdur Jabbar, expressed shock: “This is more some type of radicalization, not religion. He was a sweetheart really, a nice guy, a friend, really smart, caring.”","Shamsud-Din Jabbar left behind bomb-making materials, an open Quran and signs of a life spiraling into chaos.

Official reveals how Tesla CEO helped to track driver

The sequence of events leading to the incident

Coincident or planned?

Police behind the investigation of the explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas expressed gratitude towards CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday citing the strong construction of the vehicle body that limited the explosion. Police noted that the attack could have been worse but the vehicle limited the blast and its damage.Speaking to CNN, Kevin McMahill, sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, said that the structural design of the Cybertruck helped contain the damage in the hotel valet area, directing the explosion's force upwards and preserving the building's front glass windows.""The fact that this was a Cybertruck really limited the damage that occurred inside of the valet because it had most of the blast. Up through the truck and out,"" he said.""You'll see that the front glass doors at the Trump Hotel were not even broken by that blast which they were parked directly in front of,"" he added.He further elaborated on how the Tesla Motors’ CEO helped the police to track the driver.""I have to thank Elon Musk specifically,"" McMahill expressed gratitude towards Tesla's CEO, saying that Elon Musk provided ""additional information"", including surveillance footage from charging stations to assist in tracking the suspect.""We have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself,"" Musk said in a post on X.Musk further clarified that ""All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion,"" referring to Tesla's data collection system that monitors vehicle performance metrics, including mileage and travel distance.""It’s a Tesla truck, and we know that Elon Musk is working with President-elect Trump, and it’s the Trump tower,"" McMahill said. ""So, there’s obviously things to be concerned about there, and that’s something we continue to look at.”The Cybertruck, rented in Colorado, made its way to Las Vegas, arriving at 7.30 am on Wednesday, according to McMahill. Following an hour of driving along Las Vegas Boulevard, the vehicle reached the Trump Hotel where it detonated, according to officials.The official said that surveillance recordings showed the driver passing the Trump Hotel approximately an hour before the explosion, later returning to stop in front of the building moments before the blast.Police-released CCTV footage captured the explosion incident. Additional social media videos showed the vehicle covered in smoke whilst being extinguished with water. Police officials presented footage during a press conference showing charred petrol containers and firework mortars discovered in the remains of the severely burnt vehicle.Several law enforcement officials involved in the investigation indicated that the driver likely had military experience.Although authorities have identified who rented the vehicle, they are withholding the driver's name pending identification.The incident occurred shortly after a tragic event in New Orleans, where a pickup truck ploughed into New Year's revellers on Bourbon Street early Wednesday, causing at least 15 fatalities and numerous injuries. According to local and federal authorities, the driver possessed potential improvised explosive devices and an ISIS flag in the vehicle.Turo, an online vehicle-sharing platform, confirmed its service was used to rent vehicles involved in both the New Orleans and Las Vegas incidents, and stated it is assisting authorities.""We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat,"" a Turo spokesperson told CNN.McMahill said the shared rental platform for both incidents was merely a ""coincidence,"" and investigations are ongoing. ""We are absolutely investigating any connectivity to what happened in New Orleans as well as other attacks that have been occurring around the world,"" McMahill said.",Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday.

While FBI was looking into his ""path to radicalisation "", evidence collected since the attack showed that Jabbar was ""100% inspired by ISIS"", said Raia, using an acronym for Islamic State. Jabbar, who authorities said acted alone, was killed in a shootout with police.His half-brother, Abdur Jabbar, said that Jabbar, who had worked for audit firm Deloitte, abandoned Islam in his 20s or 30s, but had recently renewed his faith. He told Reuters in Beaumont, Texas, where Jabbar was born and raised, that he had no idea when his half-brother became radicalised.Ali Soufan, an ex-FBI agent who is on an advisory council to homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, said Jabbar did not fit the typical profile of those radicalised by IS. Jabbar served for 10 years in the US army and was in his 40s, Soufan noted, explaining that people who fall prey are typically much younger. ""This is a guy who ... went from being a patriot to being an IS terrorist.""It is still unclear what contact Jabbar might have had with overseas extremist groups. A US govt official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Jabbar travelled to Egypt in 2023, staying in Cairo for a week, before returning to the US and then travelling to Toronto for 3 days. It wasn't clear what he did during those travels.US officials and other experts say IS conducts most of its recruiting in online chatrooms and over encrypted communications apps. Recruits could either receive direct orders or self-radicalise to take action. US officials say IS has used the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza war to boost its recruitment. By inspiring individuals to carry out attacks independently, the IS aims to create an atmosphere of fear and instability, demonstrating its global influence despite lacking a physical caliphate.Attackers responsible for a range of deadly strikes have claimed a link to IS. They included the lone survivor of the Islamist squad that killed 130 people across Paris in 2015, the man who killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Florida in 2016, and the man who drove a truck into a crowded bike path in 2017 in New York City, killing eight. Some attacks, like those in 2015 in Paris, were carried out by trained IS operatives. But investigators found no proof of a direct role for the terrorist group in others.

It also insisted that Biden cited no credible evidence of the deal presenting a national security problem and suggested it will sue, saying ""we are left with no choice but to take all appropriate action to protect our legal rights.""The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States spent months reviewing the deal for national security risks but referred the decision to Biden in Dec, after failing to reach consensus.

'Trump will continue fighting against these hoaxes'

The hush-money case

Trump's other federal cases

US President-elect Donald Trump will be sentenced on January 10 for his hush-money case, a New York judge ruled Friday. Judge Juan M Merchan indicated Trump would likely receive an unconditional discharge, meaning no jail time, fine, or probation.The sentencing date comes shortly before Trump's planned return to the White House on January 20. Trump can attend the sentencing virtually.The judge rejected Trump's arguments for dismissal based on presidential immunity and his upcoming second term. Merchan said concluding the case served the interests of justice, balancing Trump's ability to govern with the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity, public expectations of equal application of the law, and respect for the jury's verdict. ""This court is simply not persuaded that the first factor outweighs the others at this stage of the proceeding,"" Merchan wrote.Trump's lawyers argued the case would disrupt his presidency, while prosecutors suggested options like freezing the case or a guaranteed no-jail sentence. The judge ruled Trump's status as president-elect doesn't grant him the same immunity as a sitting president, and dismissing the case would undermine the rule of law.Trump faces a maximum potential sentence of four years in prison, though that outcome is unlikely given the judge's indication. The sentencing was initially scheduled for July but has been postponed twice.Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director, said that the order issued by Acting Justice Merchan in the Manhattan DA's case, which he described as a ""witch hunt,"" was a direct violation of the Supreme Court's immunity decision and other longstanding jurisprudence. He added that the case should be dismissed.""Today's order by the deeply conflicted, Acting Justice Merchan in the Manhattan DA Witch Hunt is a direct violation of the Supreme Court's Immunity decision and other longstanding jurisprudence. This lawless case should have never been brought and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed,"" Cheung said in his statement on social media platform X.Cheung stressed that Trump must be allowed to continue the presidential transition process and that there should be no sentencing.""President Trump must be allowed to continue the Presidential Transition process and to execute the vital duties of the presidency, unobstructed by the remains of this or any remnants of the Witch Hunts. There should be no sentencing, and President Trump will continue fighting against these hoaxes until they are all dead,"" Cheung added.Trump was convicted in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush-money payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump denies Daniels' allegations and maintains his innocence.This conviction makes Trump the first former president convicted of a crime and the first convicted individual elected president.The case revolves around how Trump reimbursed his then-lawyer, Michael Cohen, for the payment to Daniels. Cohen called the judge’s decision “judicious and appropriate.”Trump’s legal team previously attempted to overturn the conviction based on a Supreme Court immunity decision and sought to move the case to federal court, but both efforts were unsuccessful.This case is the only one of Trump's four criminal indictments to reach trial. Two federal cases, one related to the 2020 election and the other to classified documents, have been dismissed by special counsel Jack Smith. A state election interference case in Georgia is currently on hold. Trump's lawyers argued the dismissal of the federal cases warranted dismissal of the New York hush-money case, but Judge Merchan disagreed, saying that the hush-money case was in a “vastly” different stage.","US President-elect Donald Trump will be sentenced on January 10 for his hush- money case. Judge Juan M Merchan indicated Trump would likely receive an unconditional discharge, meaning no jail time, fine, or probation. The judge rejected Trump's arguments for dismissal based on presidential immunity and his upcoming second term.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116929374,imgsize-1080124,width-400,resizemode-4/116929374.jpg"
"Half Mast Flag On Trump Inauguration: Trump says nobody wants to see 'half mast flag' during his inauguration, slams 'giddy' Dems",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-says-nobody-wants-to-see-half-mast-flag-during-his-inauguration-slams-giddy-dems/articleshow/116925814.cms,"Donald Trump said nobody wants to see half mast flag on the inauguration day of the President.

President-elect Donald Trump Friday reacted to Joe Biden 's order that flags will be lowered to half staff for 30 days in honor of former president Jimmy Carter who died at 100, and said only Democrats are giddy about this as this one-month mourning period would cover Donald Trump's inauguration.Trump said Democrats are happy about it as they don't love the country. Otherwise, nobody wants to see the flag in half-mast during the inauguration of a president.The Democrats are all “giddy” about our magnificent American Flag potentially being at “half mast” during my Inauguration. They think it’s so great, and are so happy about it because, in actuality, they don’t love our Country, they only think about themselves. Look at what they’ve done to our once GREAT America over the past four years - It’s a total mess! In any event, because of the death of President Jimmy Carter, the Flag may, for the first time ever during an Inauguration of a future President, be at half mast.

For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.""However, Trump mocked Carter on his 100th birthday in October while taking a swipe at Biden. At the time, he called Biden the ""worst"" president in U.S. history and said that Carter ""is the happiest man because Jimmy Carter is considered a brilliant president in comparison.""Carter's state funeral will be held on January 9.Flags are to be flown at half-staff to honor Carter until Tuesday, January 28—meaning they will be lowered during Trump's inauguration and through the first week of Trump's second term.But despite the rule for lowering flags to half-staff for 30 days after the death of a sitting or former president, Trump could order flags raised back to full-staff after taking office.",The US flag code requires flags to be flown at half-staff for 30 days from the death of a sitting or former president.

The deadly attack had sparked further violence and road closures in the district, restricting access to medicine, food and fuel in the area as casualties in fighting between Sunni and Shia tribes surged to 136. The conflict had forced the closing of the only road connecting Parachinar, Kurram’s headquarters, with the provincial capital of Peshawar.“Travel and security arrangements are being made for the convoy (of passengers) leaving on Saturday,” Pakistan govt spokesperson Muhammad Ali Saif said on Friday, warning that any armed aggression would be prosecuted as terrorism.The KP administration had recently formed a grand jirga, or council of political and tribal elders, which reached a peace deal between the warring Shia and Sunni tribes on Wednesday following weeks of negotiations. Under the peace agreement, both sides have agreed on the demolition of bunkers and the handover of heavy weapons to the authorities.“Both sides will give a coordinated plan of action within 15 days for the collection of weapons,” Saif said, adding that bunkers already existing in the area will be dismantled within a month.After the demolition of bunkers, according to the official, any party that launches an attack will be considered a “terrorist” and action will be taken against it.Another provision of the peace agreement states that anybody who violates the terms of the agreement by employing weapons against the other would face a Pakistani Rs 10 million ($35,933) fine. It stated that families displaced by the recent hostilities would be rehabilitated.Shia Muslims dominate parts of Kurram although they are a minority in the rest of Pakistan, which is majority Sunni.

cross-border militancy

Diplomatic efforts amid rising hostilities

What lies ahead?

Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border, leaving at least eight individuals dead and 13 others, including civilians, injured on the Afghan side. The ongoing conflict, which persisted into late Saturday night, comes amidst the growing strain between the two nations, once considered allies.The violence followed an intense exchange of fire, reportedly triggered by Pakistan's targeted airstrikes on alleged camps of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan's eastern Paktika province earlier in the week. Pakistani security officials claim the strikes were a response to a failed infiltration attempt by militants from Afghanistan.According to Pakistani sources, militants attempting to breach the border on Friday night were repelled by Pakistani forces. The following morning, these militants allegedly joined Afghan forces to launch coordinated attacks on Pakistani border posts using light and heavy weapons. The attacks targeted several areas, including Ghozgarhi, Matha Sangar, Kot Ragha, and Tari Mengal.Pakistani forces retaliated, reportedly inflicting significant losses and forcing the attackers to abandon their posts. However, the violence also claimed the life of one Frontier Corps soldier and left 11 others injured.Pakistan has long accused the Afghan Taliban of harboring TTP militants who have intensified attacks on Pakistani security forces in recent months. These attacks, particularly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan regions, have heightened security concerns in Islamabad.While urging the Afghan government to take decisive action against the TTP, Pakistan said that dialogue between the two nations could not occur amidst ongoing violence.While these diplomatic calls were failing, tensions flared after Pakistan's airstrikes in the Barmal district of Paktika on December 24, which reportedly killed at least 46 individuals, including women and children. The Taliban's ministry of defense condemned the strikes, describing them as an attack on civilians and vowing retaliation.The airstrikes came on the same day a Pakistani delegation led by Special Representative Muhammad Sadiq met Afghan leaders in Kabul in an attempt to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long hiatus. However, the Afghan government lodged a formal protest over the airstrikes, accusing Pakistan of targeting civilians rather than militants.The escalating conflict comes against the backdrop of strained relations following the TTP's termination of a ceasefire with Pakistan in November 2022. Since then, attacks by the TTP have claimed the lives of numerous Pakistani soldiers, further deteriorating ties between the neighbors.The renewed border violence, marked by both airstrikes and ground clashes, shows a growing distrust between Kabul and Islamabad. While Pakistan continues to demand action against the TTP, the Afghan Taliban denies harboring militants and accuses Pakistan of targeting civilians under the guise of counterterrorism operations.","Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border.

The boy, identified as Balach, son of Sabrullah, is from the Panjgur district, and his family members claimed that he was forcibly taken from his home ten days ago during a raid by Pakistani forces.According to The Balochistan Post, Balach was reportedly subjected to physical abuse before being taken away while still injured.Authorities have yet to comment on the incident, which has sparked concern among local and international human rights organisations.The Pakistani military's repeated targeting of the family has been documented, with previous incidents including a raid on their residence where property was damaged and two hand grenades were thrown outside, though no injuries were reported.According to local sources, the forces have conducted regular raids on the house, subjecting the family to continuous intimidation, as per the report.In another incident, Pakistani forces detained a man identified as Fazal Bashir in the coastal city of Gwadar. Fazal, a resident of Hirabad area in Kech district, was detained on December 23, and his location remains unidentified, according to The Balochistan Post.His family has sought assistance from human rights organisations to determine his whereabouts, worried about his safety.

At least 10 people were killed and hundreds injured during the May 9 riots, while approximately 40 public buildings and military installations were damaged, including the Lahore corps commander’s House (Jinnah House) and Askari Tower in Lahore, the army’s general headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) office in Faisalabad, the Radio Pakistan building in Peshawar, a toll plaza on the Swat motorway, and a PAF base in Imran’s hometown of Mianwali.Imran and his party have called for a judicial probe into last year’s events, claiming that violence on May 9 was a “false flag” operation aimed at crushing PTI. The govt and military, however, claimed they had collected substantial evidence that the attack on the country’s most powerful institution was meticulously planned and carried out by the PTI leadership.The US, UK and EU had expressed concerns over the sentencing of civilians by military courts, maintaining that the convictions were against international law.Responding to the concerns raised by countries, the foreign office (FO) had stated on Tuesday that the military courts’ judgments were made under a law enacted by parliament and were in line with the ruling of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.",Pakistan’s military courts sentenced another 60 civilians on Thursday to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years.

May 9 Riots and aftermath

International outcry

Pakistan's response

Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots that targeted military sites and other facilities following the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan This brings the total number of convictions related to the unrest to 85, according to announcements from the military’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).Among those sentenced is Hassan Niazi , Khan’s nephew, who received a 10-year prison term for his alleged role in the attack on the Lahore Corps Commander’s residence, also known as Jinnah House.The ISPR stated that the Field General Court Martial handed down the sentences after reviewing evidence and ensuring due process. “Sequel to the announcement of the May 9 punishments... the Field General Court Martial has promulgated the punishments to the following remaining 60 culprits after examining all evidence, ensuring the provision of all legal rights to the convicts, completion of due process, and the appropriate legal proceedings,” the ISPR announced.The convicted individuals face sentences ranging from two to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment. They have the right to appeal the decisions under Pakistan's Constitution.The unrest on May 9 erupted after Imran Khan’s arrest in a corruption case. Supporters of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party allegedly attacked key military installations, including the Army General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, the Corps Commander’s House in Lahore, and an ISI office in Faisalabad.In response, authorities detained hundreds of individuals, and 103 were handed over to military courts for trial, sparking widespread criticism of the opaque judicial process.The convictions have drawn sharp rebukes from international entities, including the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union. Critics argue that the use of military courts to try civilians undermines judicial independence and transparency.“These military courts lack judicial independence, transparency, and due process guarantees,” the US State Department said. Similarly, the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCO) criticized the lack of transparency and independent oversight in the trials, emphasizing the importance of adhering to fair trial standards under international law.The European Union also expressed concern, highlighting that Pakistan’s actions contradict its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and commitments tied to the GSP+ trade program.The Pakistani government has defended the use of military courts, citing the Supreme Court’s decision that allowed the military to proceed with trials of civilians involved in the riots. The Foreign Office reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to international human rights obligations, asserting that the trials were conducted in accordance with national laws.The ISPR emphasized that the convictions reflect the military’s resolve to uphold justice and maintain the authority of the state, stating, “The Nation, Government, and Armed Forces remain steadfast in their commitment to upholding justice and ensuring that the inviolable writ of the state is maintained.”","Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots.

""We will work, support and cooperate on the economic and trade fronts and things are moving fast on these fronts,"" Dar said, adding that he will be in Bangladesh on the invitation received from chief adviser Muhammad Yunus during the D-8 Summit in Cairo in Dec. His trip to Dhaka will be the first by any Pakistani foreign minister since 2012.On the sidelines of the summit, Yunus had urged Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif to settle the issues of 1971 to help Dhaka move forward with its relationship with Islamabad. ""The issues have kept coming again and again. Let's settle those issues for us to move forward,"" Yunus had told the Pak PM. Sharif had said the 1974 tripartite agreement involving Bangladesh, Pakistan and India settled things, ""but if there are other outstanding issues,"" he would be happy to look at them.","Bangladesh is Pakistan's ""lost brother"" and the visit to Dhaka next month will be ""crucial,"" foreign minister Ishaq Dar says.

Presidential security services blocked investigators, citing safety concerns. The agency expressed 'serious regret about the attitude of the suspect, who did not respond to a process by law.'Yoon has been residing at his official residence since December 12, when he last appeared publicly in a televised address. A court issued a warrant for his detention on Tuesday following his declaration of martial law on December 3 and subsequent impeachment by the national assembly on December 14. He faces charges of rebellion.Yoon’s lawyers challenged the detention warrant, arguing that the residence is protected from searches without consent due to potential military secrets. They also claim the investigating agency lacks the authority to investigate rebellion charges. “The agency’s efforts to detain Yoon were ‘reckless’ and showed an ‘outrageous discard for law’,” said Seok Dong-hyeon, one of Yoon’s lawyers.The standoff began Friday when investigators and police officers arrived at the residence to execute the warrant. South Korea's Defense Ministry confirmed investigators passed a military unit guarding the grounds, but presidential security forces blocked them from entering the building. Scuffles were reported between investigators and security forces.Opposition lawmakers called on acting President Choi Sang-mok to order the presidential security service to stand down. “Do not drag the upright staff of the presidential security service and other public officials into the depths of crime,” said Democratic lawmaker Jo Seung-lae, adding, “Choi must ‘remember that swiftly addressing the rebellion and preventing further chaos is your responsibility’”.Yoon’s presidential powers remain suspended following his impeachment. The Constitutional Court is currently deliberating whether to uphold the impeachment and remove him from office or reinstate him. The National Assembly also impeached former acting President and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo last week for his inaction in filling Constitutional Court vacancies.Two new justices were appointed on Tuesday by the current acting president.
