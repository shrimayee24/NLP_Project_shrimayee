"After Russia, PM Modi may visit Ukraine as West outrages",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-russia-pm-modi-may-visit-ukraine-as-west-outrages/articleshow/112069643.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi may visit Kyiv next month in another balancing act on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, hoping it will calm frayed nerves in Washington and major European capitals which have been dismayed by the timing of his visit to Russia earlier this month. According to diplomatic sources, both sides are in talks to finalise a date for the visit in the last week of August.If it happens, it will be the first visit by an Indian PM to Ukraine.It will come in the middle of some serious strife, including the “tough conversations” that the US says it is having with India, over Modi’s embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin which coincided with the NATO summit in Washington and also the reported bombing of a children’s hospital in Kyiv by Russia. That Modi chose Russia for his first bilateral visit since the inauguration of his third term also fuelled the outrage.Government sources defended the talks for Modi’s visit saying it had been in the works for a while after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy invited the PM. Organising the visit will also be a logistical challenge, as a source said. Like other leaders who have visited Ukraine, Modi will probably have to undertake an overnight train journey from Poland to reach the Ukrainian capital. A few of the dates under discussion are close to August 24, Ukraine’s national day, and it remains to be seen if India will want the visit to coincide with that.Shortly after images of the Modi-Putin hug were beamed across the world, Zelenskyy had said that on a day Russia had bombed a children’s hospital, the embrace was not just a huge disappointment but also a devastating blow to peace efforts. India did express its displeasure to Ukraine over the remarks but without publicly saying so. Foreign minister S Jaishankar also spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba after Modi returned from Russia.Following the remarks by Zelenskyy, and with the US raising concerns even in the middle of the Russia visit, Modi had specifically raised the issue of violence against children with Putin the next morning.Apart from China, India remains the only major country to have not condemned Russia explicitly for its aggression against Ukraine. While India’s position on the war has been seen by many as pro-Russia neutrality, India has maintained since the beginning of the invasion in February 2022 that it wants to be able to reach out to both sides to emphasise the significance of dialogue and diplomacy in resolving the conflict.India has so far avoided mediating itself between the 2 parties but has repeatedly said it will offer all possible support within its means for restoration of peace and emphasised the role of dialogue in reaching a peaceful settlement. India’s extremely nuanced approach was further highlighted at the recent Swiss peace summit in which, unlike China, it participated but didn’t endorse the outcome document because Russia wasn’t invited to the summit.For the US and others though, the timing of Modi’s visit seems to have acted as the straw that broke the camel’s back, with the Biden administration publicly ticking off India. While NSA Jake Sullivan reminded the Indian government Russia will always choose China over India, US ambassador Eric Garcetti said after Modi returned from his visit that India-US ties are not deep enough to be taken for granted by either side.","PM Narendra Modi may visit Kyiv next month in another balancing act on the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

Uttarakhand cops probe covering of mosque on kanwar route,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uttarakhand-cops-probe-covering-of-mosque-on-kanwar-route/articleshow/112072117.cms,"HARIDWAR/DEHRADUN: A day after controversy erupted over covering of a mosque and mazar on the kanwar yatra route with white sheets in an apparent bid to screen places of worship of the minority community falling on the main path taken by kanwariyas headed towards the Har-ki-Pauri ghat, questions remain on who issued the orders for the move. Commenting on the issue, senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Haridwar, Pramendra Dobhal, said on Saturday, ""The matter has come to our knowledge through social media.An investigation into it at the level of SP city is under way. Further action in the matter will be based on the outcome of the investigation.""A spot visit by TOI to Jwalapur - the minority-dominated area where the screens were put up on July 22 and subsequently removed on Friday after the issue gained traction on social media - revealed that there was raging discussion amongst locals on the issue. ""Instead of saying that covering the religious places was part of the administration's strategy to maintain peace during the kanwar yatra, district administration and police officials chose to deny any role in the move,which makes it suspicious,"" said Ankit Verma, a local CA.Anwar Ali, caretaker of the Islamiya mosque, which was 'covered', said, ""Neither the district administration nor police consulted or informed us before installing screens in front of the mosque."" He added that ""some police personnel who were not from the local police station as we knew most of the local cops, came in the night a few days ago and asked us to provide support in putting up the screens."" ""Next morning, we saw labourers erecting the screens in front of the mosque. There was nothing much we could do about it,"" he added.Bhure Shah mazar's caretaker (gaddi nasheen) Shakeel Ahmed, voicing similar sentiments, said, ""We do not know why and when the screen was put up at our mazar, nor do we know why it was removed. In the last 40 years since I have been here, no such thing has ever been done.""One of the officers of the state police said that the ""instruction to cover the religious structures was most likely a verbal one, considering matters related to the kanwar yatra are being heard in court"". He added, ""We have been directed not to speak too much about the matter."" Haridwar district magistrate, Dheeraj Gabryal, had said on Friday, ""There was no instruction passed by the district administration to cover any religious sites falling on the route of kanwar yatra.""After the issue gained prominence, senior cabinet minister Satpal Maharaj, who holds the tourism, culture and PWD portfolio, said on Friday that ""this has been done so that there is no unnecessary excitement or provocation from any side and the yatra runs smoothly.""Meanwhile, local BJP leaders were planning to raise the issue before chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami who was expected to visit Haridwar in a day or two.

Critics argue that Musk's statements are harmful and stigmatizing to transgender individuals, while supporters contend that he is raising legitimate concerns about the medical treatment of minors.The controversy comes amid broader cultural tensions over issues of gender identity and parental rights. Musk's decision to relocateSpaceX headquarters to Texas, citing a new California law limiting parental notification of a child's gender identity change, further underscores these divisions.Musk's pledge to take on the ""woke"" left likely inspired his latest decision to move the California headquarters for SpaceX to Texas, after Gov.

Reports swirled on Sunday that Vice President Kamala Harris made a surprise video appearance at Comic-Con during a "" Simpsons "" panel. According to these reports, 'Simpsons' creator Matt Groening introduced a clip featuring Harris, describing it as coming from a super fan.The video reportedly showed Harris quoting a popular "" Treehouse of Horror "" episode — the beloved ""Simpsons"" Halloween special — which centered around the 1996 presidential election between then-President Bill Clinton and Republican nominee Bob Dole.This sparked excitement and speculation among fans, with many believing that the video was a new creation, made specifically for Comic-Con.The clip generated buzz, as people began to say that 'The Simpsons' had once again predicted the future, referencing Harris' current political prominence and presidential ambitions.However, sources close to the show have clarified the truth behind the video. The clip, while authentic, is not a new production, as per the report by TMZ. It was recorded years ago and has resurfaced in light of the current political climate and Harris' ongoing campaign efforts. The video was not created specifically for this year's Comic-Con event.This revelation comes as Harris embarks on an extensive campaign blitz, particularly targeting Gen Z voters. Following her emergence as the presumptive Democratic nominee after Joe Biden, she has been utilizing various platforms to reach potential voters and solidify her position against Donald Trump.With just over 100 days left before the election, Harris is determined to connect with the electorate and showcase why she believes she is the right choice for the presidency. The resurfaced 'Simpsons' clip, while intriguing, is part of a broader narrative that intertwines pop culture with the unpredictable world of politics.So, while the clip shown at Comic-Con is indeed real, it is not a recent production meant for this year’s event. Instead, it’s a nostalgic piece that has found renewed relevance amid Harris' current political journey.","Reports swirled on Sunday that Vice President Kamala Harris made a surprise video appearance at Comic-Con during a "" Simpsons "" panel.

Shift in campaign focus following Biden’s withdrawal

Dig at Harris’ name

'Kamala is Biden’s border czar'

Former President Donald Trump escalated his criticism of Kamala Harris on Saturday calling her a “bum” and accused her of failing in her role as Vice President. “She was a bum three weeks ago. She was a bum, a failed vice president ,” Trump said.In his first public appearance without an ear bandage since surviving an assassination attempt, Trump addressed a gathering at the Believers Summit in West Palm Beach, Florida, where he also portrayed Harris as a proponent of extreme left-wing policies and accused her of wanting to impose ""crazy San Francisco liberal values"" on the nation, citing her potential judicial appointments as a means to enforce these views nationwide.""Kamala Harris will appoint hundreds of extreme far-left judges to forcibly impose crazy San Francisco liberal values on Americans,"" Trump said.This speech marked Trump's second major campaign appearance since President Joe Biden's unexpected decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race earlier this week. The shift in the race dynamics led Trump to refocus his criticisms from Biden to Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee.The former president also declared Harris “worse than Joe Biden and, in a true sense, much more liberal.”Trump continued to take digs at President Biden, saying, ""Biden didn't want to do what he did. He said, 'I will never go out, I will never ever go out.' Two days later, 'I'm proud to go out.' Because the fascists threatened him with the 25th Amendment. They said we can do it the nice way or we can do it the hard way, Joe. That's what happened, I know. I know as many people on that side as I know on our side. But that's what happened. And now they are trying to make him a brave hero. 'He is so brave.'Trump also took aim at Biden’s recent speech regarding his decision to withdraw. ""The other night he made a speech. Look, I am not going to look into it, I am going to give people credit or no credit. It was horrible,"" Trump remarked, questioning the sincerity and quality of Biden’s address.The Republican presidential nominee also took jabs at Harris’ name, which he has been repeatedly accused of fumbling on purpose.“And by the way, there are numerous ways of saying her name. They were explaining to me, ‘You can say Comma-la, you can say Kah-mala,'” Trump said. He consistently uses the latter, which is incorrect.“I said, ‘Don’t worry about it. It doesn’t matter what I say,'” he continued. “I couldn’t care less if I mispronounce it.”Trump’s speech continued his campaign’s pattern of attacking Harris on immigration issues, despite her role not encompassing overall border policy. He described her as President Biden’s “border czar,” a designation not officially assigned but used by Republicans to criticize her handling of migration issues, reported the Washington Post.Trump's speech, aimed at a predominantly Christian audience, was notable for its direct assault on Harris's policies and beliefs. He claimed that Harris would expand the Supreme Court with “hard-core Marxists” to undermine the Constitution and religious freedoms. Trump's rhetoric also included controversial statements about abortion rights, accusing Harris of supporting extreme late-term abortions—a claim that is not supported by current laws or Harris’s actual policy positions.In addition to his abortion comments, Trump criticized Harris for her handling of immigration, broadly characterizing immigrants in a negative light and alleging without evidence that Harris and Democrats were encouraging illegal border crossings to increase voter rolls.Trump also took aim at Harris’s response to the Israel-Palestine conflict, accusing her of being “hostile to Americans of faith” and failing to support Israel adequately. He used his recent meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago estate to bolster his pro-Israel stance and further criticize Harris.James Singer, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, condemned Trump's remarks as offensive and misleading. “Trump went on and on and on, and generally sounded like someone you wouldn’t want to sit near at a restaurant—let alone be president of the United States,” Singer said in a statement.",'Kamala is Biden’s border czar' 'She was a bum three weeks ago' 'I couldn’t care less if I mispronounce it’ 'She will appoint hundreds of extreme far-left judges to forcibly impose crazy San Francisco liberal values',"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112058338,imgsize-3825983,width-400,resizemode-4/112058338.jpg"

A UAE court has jailed 57 Bangladeshi citizens to lengthy prison terms for protesting against the Sheikh Hasina government over the controversial quota decision .The Bangladeshi citizens were jailed as unauthorised protests are banned in the Gulf country.Commenting on the case, Amnesty International 's UAE researcher Devin Kenney said it was ""the second mass trial in the UAE this month, with dozens of people sentenced to huge prison terms literally overnight, on charges involving no element of violence"".In a statement to news agency AFP, Kenney said the UAE's ""extreme reaction to the mere existence of a public protest on Emirati soil shows that the state places great priority on suppressing any manifestation of dissent in the country.""Meanwhile, a Bangladeshi student leader on Monday called for a 48-hour halt to the protest against the quota decision, which embroiled the nation in deadly clashes resulting in the death of over 100 people.""We are suspending the shutdown protests for 48 hours,"" Nahid Islam, the top leader of the main protest organiser Students Against Discrimination, told news agency AFP. Nahid Islam demanded the government to ""withdraw the curfew, restore the internet and stop targeting thestudent protesters "" in the halt period.In what could be deciphered as a sign of ease, the halt comes a day after the Bangladesh Supreme Court scaled down the controversial quota decision of the Sheikh Hasina government that facilitated 30 per cent reservation in government jobs to descendants of 1971 war heroes, who fought for the Independent against Pakistani regime.As the situation appears to head towards normalcy, the Bangladesh police have arrested more than 500 people, including some opposition leaders, over days of clashes in the capital Dhaka.""At least 532 people have been arrested over the violence,"" Dhaka Metropolitan Police spokesman Faruk Hossain.""They include some BNP leaders,"" he added, referring to the opposition Bangladesh National Party.After days of deadly violence, normalcy returned to Bangladesh on Wednesday as factories, offices, and banks reopened following the easing of a nationwide curfew enforced by the army.

However, social media platforms remained suspended in the wake of student-led protests that turned violent last week.Despite the easing of restrictions, Zunaid Ahmed Palak, a junior technology minister, informed reporters that ""For now, all social media will remain shut,"" indicating that the government is still cautious about the potential for further unrest.","UAE court jails 57 Bangladeshi citizens to lengthy prison terms for protesting against the Sheikh Hasina government over the controversial quota decision.

Kamala Harris Launches Her Campaign for President

Violation of platform policies

X's policy on misleading media

World’s richest man Elon Musk has stepped into one of the most contentious issues in US politics: deepfake videos. On Friday night, Musk, the owner of the social media platform X, reposted an edited campaign video of Vice President Kamala Harris that appears to have been digitally manipulated in a deceptive manner.The video mimics Harris’s voice, but instead of her original words from the campaign ad, it features her falsely stating that President Joe Biden is senile, that she does not “know the first thing about running the country,” and that she is the “ultimate diversity hire,” reported NYT.The clip was also edited to remove images of former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, replacing them with images of Biden. The original, unaltered ad, titled “We Choose Freedom,” was released by the Harris campaign on Thursday.The version posted on X lacks a disclaimer, although the account that initially uploaded it, @MrReaganUSA, labeled it as a “parody.” When Musk reposted the video eight hours later, he did not include any such disclosure, simply commenting, “This is amazing,” followed by a laughing emoji. The post has since been viewed 98 million times.The original, unaltered ad, which the Harris campaign released on Thursday, is titled “We Choose Freedom.”Musk’s repost appears to violate X’s policies, which prohibit sharing “synthetic, manipulated or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people and lead to harm.” Some observers were quick to call out the post. “This is a violation of @X’s policies on synthetic media & misleading identities,” Alex Howard, director of the Digital Democracy Project at the Demand Progress Education Fund, posted on the platform. “Are you going to retroactively change them to allow violations in an election year?”The Harris campaign issued a statement saying, “The American people want the real freedom, opportunity and security Vice President Harris is offering; not the fake, manipulated lies of Elon Musk and Donald Trump.”X’s policy on misleading media, instituted in April 2023 after Musk’s acquisition of the platform, defines such content as “significantly and deceptively altered, manipulated or fabricated” and “likely to result in widespread confusion on public issues.” The policy mandates that such content must be labeled or removed.","Elon Musk reposted an edited campaign video of Kamala Harris that appears to have been digitally manipulated in a deceptive manner.

'Gen Z feels the Kamalove': How Kamala Harris campaign gains youth traction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gen-z-feels-the-kamalove-how-kamala-harris-campaign-gains-youth-traction/articleshow/112073237.cms,"“ Brats for Harris .” “ We need a Kamalanomenon. ” “ Gen Z feels the Kamalove .”In the days since President Joe Biden exited the presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, Gen Z voters have taken to social media to share coconut tree and ""brat summer"" memes, marking a significant shift in tone for a generation that has often felt overlooked by the Democratic Party.Youth-led progressive organizations have warned for months that Biden had a problem with young voters , urging the president to work more closely with them on key issues. With Biden out of the race, many young leaders are now hopeful that Harris can revive support among Gen Z and harness a new wave of enthusiasm.Since last Sunday, statements have poured out from youth-led organizations across the country, including in Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, California, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. Leaders thanked Biden for stepping aside and celebrated the chance to rally around a new candidate. On Friday, a coalition of 17 youth-led groups endorsed Harris.“This changes everything,” said Zo Tobi, director of communication for the Movement Voter Project, a national progressive funding group focusing on youth-led organizations. “The world as it is suddenly shifted into the world as it could be,” Tobi was quoted as saying by AP.As the campaign enters a new phase, both Harris and her Republican rival, Donald Trump, are focusing on younger voters who could be crucial in some of the most contested states.Harris recorded a brief video message shown Saturday at a conference of Gen Z activists and elected officials in Atlanta.“We know young voters will be key, and we know your vote cannot be taken for granted,” Harris told the gathering, emphasizing her support for gun safety, abortion rights, LGBTQ rights, and climate action.Eve Levenson, the national youth engagement director for Harris’ campaign, attended the conference in Atlanta and praised young voters for their enthusiastic response to Harris’ elevation as the likely nominee.“As amazing as it is to see the tremendous youth enthusiasm online, what has been even more incredible is how that online energy has already translated into a tangible desire to take action and get involved with our campaign,” she said, noting new voter registrations, small donations from young voters, and student requests to help start campus-based campaign organizations.Trump, in his own address Friday in Florida to a conference on faith hosted by Turning Point USA, criticized Harris as “incompetent” and “far left.” He vowed to champion religious Americans' causes in a second White House term.“With your vote, I will defend religious liberty in all of its forms,” Trump told the conservative group that focuses on high school, college, and university campuses. ""I will protect Christians in our schools and our military and our government and our workplaces and our hospitals, in our public square, and I will also protect other religions.""John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, who has worked with Biden, said the “white-hot energy” among young people is something he hasn't seen since former President Barack Obama’s campaign. While there's little reliable polling so far, he described the dynamic as “a combination of the hopefulness we saw with Obama and the urgency and fight we saw after the Parkland shooting.”For many young people, it was the first time they felt heard and believed their actions could impact politics, he and several young leaders said.“It’s reset this election in profound ways,"" he said. ""People, especially young people, for so long, for so many important reasons, have been despondent about politics, despondent about the direction of the country. It’s weighed on them. And then they wake up the next morning, and it seems like everything’s changed.”About 6 in 10 adults under 30 voted for Biden in 2020, according to AP VoteCast, but his ratings with the group have dipped substantially since then, with only about a quarter saying they had a favorable opinion of him in the most recent AP-NORC poll conducted before Biden withdrew from the race.That poll, along with polls from The New York Times/Siena and CNN conducted after Biden dropped out, suggests Harris starts off with somewhat better favorable ratings than Biden among young adults.Sunjay Muralitharan, vice president of College Democrats of America, said it felt like a weight was lifted off his chest when Harris entered the race.Despite monthly coalition calls between youth-led groups and the Biden campaign, Muralitharan spent months worrying about how Biden would fare among young voters as he watched young people leave organizations like the College Democrats and Young Democrats to join more leftist groups.College Democrats issued statements and social media posts encouraging the party to prioritize young people and change course on the war in Gaza. They worked tirelessly to get College Dems programming at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago later this summer, but received limited outreach in return, Muralitharan said.A Harris campaign represents an opportunity to move in a new direction, he said. The vice president has shown her vocal support for issues important to young voters such as climate change and reproductive rights, and she may be able to change course from Biden's approach to the war in Gaza.“The perpetual roadblock we’ve run into is that Biden is the lesser of two evils and his impact on the crisis in Gaza,"" he said. ""For months, we’ve been given this broken script that’s made it difficult for us to organize young voters. But that changes now.”Santiago Mayer, executive director of the Gen Z voter engagement organization Voters of Tomorrow, said the Biden campaign “created an entirely new framework for operating with youth organizations” that can now be transitioned into supporting Harris' campaign.“Gen Z loves VP Harris, and VP Harris loves Gen Z,"" he said. ""So we’re ready to get to work for her.”","Youth-led progressive organizations have warned for months that Biden had a problem with young voters. With Biden out of the race, many young leaders are now hopeful that Kamala Harris can revive support among Gen Z. Since last Sunday, statements have poured out from youth-led organizations across the country.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112073284,imgsize-36108,width-400,resizemode-4/112073284.jpg"

But this is a people-powered campaign, and we have momentum,” she told the crowd at the event, which her campaign announced would net $1.4 million.""Donald Trump has been resorting to some wild lies about my record. And some of what he and his running mate are saying, well, it's just plain weird,"" she added.As Trump addressed a Bitcoin conference in Tennessee, Harris was at a fundraising event in Massachusetts with celebrity guests including singer-songwriter James Taylor and cellist Yo-Yo Ma.The Harris campaign has adopted ""weird"" as a new catch-all for describing Trump's aggressive rhetoric. His attacks include false allegations that Harris wants to legalize killing newborn babies, stemming from her fervent support of abortion rights. Harris has made her advocacy on this issue central to her campaign against Trump, whose conservative nominees to the Supreme Court helped overturn the national right to the procedure in 2022.The former California prosecutor also challenged Trump to a debate after his campaign announced this week he would not agree to keep a September 10 televised face-off previously scheduled with Biden.""I hope he reconsiders because we have a lot to talk about,"" she said.Trump, 78, is now the oldest major-party nominee in history and is scrambling to reorient an election against someone two decades his junior, having expected to face an 81-year-old incumbent Joe Biden beset by concerns over infirmity.On Saturday, he made his pitch to the cryptocurrency industry, one he previously called a ""scam."" Saying China or others could seize the reins on the fast-growing field, Trump's appeal is welcomed by crypto enthusiasts who feel they have been treated harshly by the Biden administration.""This is the steel industry of 100 years ago,"" Trump told the bitcoin conference. ""I think you're just in your infancy.""""If crypto is going to define the future I want (it) to be mined, minted and made in the USA,"" he said to cheers, calling for the United States to be ""the crypto capital of the planet.""Trump also vowed a return to outdoor rallies two weeks after being wounded in an attempted assassination at a campaign event in Pennsylvania.""I will continue to do outdoor rallies, and the Secret Service has agreed to substantially step up their operation. They are very capable of doing so,"" Trump said on his Truth Social platform.""No one can ever be allowed to stop or impede free speech or gathering,"" he added.Trump has made the shooting a key part of his campaign pitch, telling supporters he ""took a bullet for democracy."" He and running mate JD Vance will hold a rally later Saturday night at an indoor hockey arena in the midwestern US state of Minnesota.Harris, seeking to become the first female president in US history, is tasked with rapidly assembling a campaign against an opponent who has been in near permanent reelection mode since he became president in 2016.Her late-starting White House bid has enjoyed early momentum. Polls that had shown Biden steadily slipping against Trump now show Harris in a race too close to call. She's garnered support from Democratic heavyweights, including Biden himself and most recently Barack and Michelle Obama.Torianna Parrish, 34, was among the crowd greeting Harris upon her arrival Saturday afternoon at the airport in Westfield, Massachusetts.""I wanted to show there's power in numbers. I wanted to show my support,"" she said. ""We're rooting for her, and we want to see her make this country what it needs to be.""Harris was introduced at the Colonial Theater in Pittsfield by Taylor, who said: ""Let us honor the woman and the moment, and may our ardent support be the wind in her sails.

'Trump just a bad man'

JD Vance reacts to leaked mails

JD Vance , Donald Trump's running mate in the upcoming election, was once a Trump hater and Vance's campaign has not tried to put a fig-leaf onto it. They said Vance's opinion about Trump evolved over the ages. Now an old friend of Vance, Sofia Nelson, who identifies himself as a transgender, has leaked his old private mail exchanges with Vance -- to the New York Times hoping that voters would be now well informed about Mr Vance -- who already is at the center of a major controversy for his past remark on 'childless cat ladies'.Sofia and Vance went to Yale Law School together and kept in touch until 2021 when Vance said he supported an Arkansas ban on gender-affirming care for minors.The NYT published several excepts from those mails showing that Vance was a different person at that time.In a 2015, JD Vance wrote he was outraged by Donald Trump's rhetoric. ""...and I worry most of all about how welcome Muslim citizens feel in their own country. But I also think that people have always believed crazy s***. And there may have always been demagogues willing to exploit the people who believe crazy s*** ""In his book Hillbilly Elegy, Vance mistakenly referred to Nelson as lesbian instead of transgender and apologized for it. That did not break their friendship though.In another email, JD Vance wrote Trump is ""just a bad man. A morally reprehensible human being"".The revelations came amid reports that Trump may change his running mate in the wake of several controversies. It was also reported Saturday that Vance's wife Usha used to be ""appalled"" by Trump.The New York Times reached out to JD Vance's campaign for a comment on the leaked mail exchanged. His spokesperson said the senator wishes Sofia, who leaked the mails, very best.""Senator Vance values his friendships with individuals across the political spectrum. He has been open about the fact that some of his views from a decade ago began to change after becoming a dad and starting a family, and he has thoroughly explained why he changed his mind on President Trump. Despite their disagreements, Senator Vance cares for Sofia and wishes Sofia the very best,"" the statement said,","JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate in the upcoming election, was once a Trump hater.

Reacting to the viral news, Imran Khan's aide Sayed Z Bukhari said the decision has not been taken whether Imran Khan would contest but there are consultations going on.""No decision has been made about Imran Khan running for Chancellor of Oxford University , however we have a series of consultations regarding it today and will be decided in the next 24-48hrs,"" Bukhari posted.According to the UK Telegraph, the elections for the chancellor post will be held online for the first time. Generally, the post goes to graduates of the university, mostly politicians.Imran Khan graduated from Oxford in 1972, studied economics and politics at Keble College and also captained the cricket team of the university. In 2005, Imran Khan became the chancellor of Bradford University and hence if he becomes the Oxford chancellor, it will not be his first such role.Reports said Imran Khan's team cited public demand that he should contest but it will be a tough one as Boris Johnson, Tony Blair -- the former UK PMs -- are also in the race.The news came as Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf faces crisis in the country with the present government planning to ban the party. Information minister Attaullah Tarar recently announced the decision that the government will ban the party after seeing all available evidence in connection with last year's protests.71-year-old Imran Khan has been in the Adiala Jail for almost a year for his conviction in four cases -- two Toshakhana references, the cipher case, and the Iddat case, in which his wife, Bushra Bibi, is also jailed.",Imran Khan is reportedly planning to apply for the position of the chancellor at Oxford University.

Ahmadiyya Persecution Pakistan: UN experts urge halt to violence against Ahmadis in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/un-experts-urge-halt-to-violence-against-ahmadis-in-pakistan/articleshow/112012460.cms,"GENEVA: United Nations experts on Thursday voiced grave concern at reports of surging discrimination and violence against Pakistan's Ahmadi minority community, including extrajudicial killings and attacks on places of worship.The Ahmadiyya sect, considered heretics by fundamentalist groups, has been persecuted for decades in Pakistan but threats and intimidation have risen in recent years.""We are alarmed by ongoing reports of violence and discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan,"" said the eight independent experts, including the special rapporteurs on extrajudicial executions, on freedom of expression and freedom of religion.""Urgent measures are necessary to respond to these violent attacks and the broader atmosphere of hatred and discrimination which feeds it,"" they said in a statement.The experts, who are appointed by the UN Human Rights Council but who do not speak on behalf of the United Nations, highlighted a number of specific incidents over recent months.Those included the extrajudicial killing of two Ahmadis in Saad Ullah Pur on July 8 and the killing on March 4 of the president of the Ahmadiyya community in Bahawalpur district.They also noted reports of an alarming number of attacks on Ahmadi places of worshipand cemeteries since the beginning of the year, including some that had led to the serious injury of worshippers.The statement also highlighted a number of alleged arbitrary arrests of Ahmadi worshippers over religious holiday periods ""to obstruct their participation in their religious practices"".Ahmadis consider themselves Muslims, and their faith is identical to mainstream Islam in almost every way.But their belief that the movement's founder Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was the ""mahdi"" or messiah has marked them as blasphemous unbelievers, particularly in Pakistan. There are around 500,000 Amadis in Pakistan according to their community leadership.The constitution has branded them non-Muslims since 1974, and a 1984 law forbids them from claiming their faith as Islamic or openly practising Islamic rituals.""Ahmadis' right to peacefully manifest their beliefs must be respected,"" the experts insisted, warning that ""judicial harassment serves to normalise violence against Ahmadis by non-State actors"".They welcomed Pakistan National Assembly 's adoption last month of a resolution urging federal and provincial governments to ensure the safety and security of all Pakistani citizens including religious minorities.But, they cautioned, ""such good-faith efforts to counter discriminatory discourse will be ineffective unless they address its structural drivers, (including) blasphemy laws and discriminatory legal provisions "".","The Ahmadiyya sect has been persecuted for decades in Pakistan.

"Imran Khan's party holds hunger strike outside Parliament House in Pakistan against injustice, unfairness",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-khans-party-holds-hunger-strike-outside-parliament-house-in-pakistan-against-injustice-unfairness/articleshow/111968344.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Jailed former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan 's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf on Tuesday kicked off a token hunger strike by setting up a camp outside the Parliament House in Islamabad . The decision to launch this protest comes a day after authorities raided the PTI central office in the capital and arrested its information secretary Raoof Hasan, followed by sealing off the office building.Pakistani authorities sealed the central office of Khan's party here over violation of safety standards.Islamabad's Metropolitan Corporation took action on Monday amidst rising legal challenges faced by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and its founder Khan.PTI chief Gohar Khan told journalists outside the Parliament that the hunger strike would be observed daily till 8 pm as a token protest to press for the release of 71-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician and reverse the injustice being done to the party.He said the protest conveyed the party's position against the ""injustice, unfairness, and the illegal and unconstitutional things that are happening [to us].""""The PTI founder (Khan) and his wife have been imprisoned for no reason. This camp will continue till the release of the PTI founder,"" he said.Khan has been imprisoned at the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi for almost a year upon his conviction in three cases - the Toshakhana corruption case, the cipher case, and the un-Islamic marriage case -- in which his wife, Bushra Bibi, is also jailed.Though Khan had secured bail or his conviction was set aside, he has not been released.Khan was arrested on August 5 last year after his conviction in the first Toshakhana corruption case filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan. Since then, he has been kept in jail in various cases.Gohar also said that the party's reservations regarding ""illegal and unconstitutional actions"" had been conveyed to National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and the party decided to raise voice for the PTI lawmakers and their families who were being picked up.He also strongly condemned the sealing of the party's secretariat in the federal capital.Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser said that the major demand was to set Khan and his wife free.""Our first demand is to release the PTI founder, his wife Bushra Bibi and other detainees, including Raoof Hasan and party workers,"" he said.He also demanded the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) led coalition government to immediately resign over ""bad governance and mismanaging the economy"".The strike came as authorities were gradually increasing pressure on the PTI, which continued to target the establishment and the government. Despite dozens of cases against Khan, he has refused to soften his tone and instead routinely criticise the Army leadership.PTI leaders have also kept up the pressure on the government by calling it illegal which allegedly came to power through fraudulent elections.","Pakistani authorities sealed the central office of Imran Khan's party here over violation of safety standards.
