Operation Sindoor: Did India mean to send a message to China too? Shashi Tharoor responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-did-india-mean-to-send-a-message-to-china-too-shashi-tharoor-responds/articleshow/121635693.cms,"Shashi Tharoor in Washington.

Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , who is in US leading an all-party delegation on Operation Sindoor executed by the military, on Wednesday (local time) reflected on the Chinese 'kill chain' deployed by Pakistan.Interacting with reporters in Washington, Tharoor was asked if India's military action against Pakistan had a message for China. ""The fact that they (Pakistan) were using Chinese weapons and we were bypassing some of the Chinese radar defences, and the famous sort of Chinese network system. .. it all comes, and that's supposed to be the great sort of Chinese 'kill chain' we read about in the newspapers. When India decided to bypass some of those threats and hit the airfields, I don't think they're worrying about who gets the message. They want to make sure that the Pakistanis got the message, and they got the rough end of what we were sending them, which they did... I do believe that what happened on the night of the 9th and 10th (May) speaks for itself, and even more so, the immediate reaction of Pakistan the next morning to call off the conflict also speaks very vividly for itself, and maybe that's the message the Chinese will have to look at.""He criticised Pakistan's targeting of civilian areas following India's strikes on nine bases belonging to terror organisations listed by the United Nations Terrorism Sanctions Committee, the 1267 Committee's designated terrorists.At the National Press Club in the US on Wednesday (local time), Tharoor described the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir 's Pahalgam as distressing and disruptive to India's growth trajectory. He noted the significant tourism growth in Kashmir, surpassing visitor numbers to Aspen, Colorado in the previous summer.He said, ""In fact, in Kashmir, it's very striking that the previous summer we've seen more tourism and more tourists coming than Aspen, Colorado gets every year. And in the course of this year, the first few months of this year, there's been a 100 per cent increase on the corresponding months of last year. So Kashmir was booming ordinary, Kashmiris are benefiting from vast numbers of tourists coming in, putting money into their hands and their pockets. It was a lovely time and here's this innocent group of holidays, tourists on a dappled meadow in Kashmir being murdered in cold blood by people coming and asking their religion and shooting them between the eyes.""The Indian Armed Forces initiated Operation Sindoor on May 7 in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack by Pakistan-sponsored terrorists, which resulted in 26 casualties and numerous injuries.The operation targeted terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, eliminating over 100 terrorists from organisations including Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Hizbul Mujahideen. Following subsequent Pakistani aggression, Indian Forces responded by targeting their airbases. Both nations agreed to cease hostilities on May 10.",Congress MP Shashi Tharoor is in US leading an all-party delegation on Operation Sindoor executed by the military.

Harvard University: Donald Trump bars foreign students from coming to US to study at Harvard University; what next?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/unsuitable-destination-trump-bars-foreign-students-from-coming-to-us-to-study-at-harvard-university-what-next/articleshow/121635330.cms,"Harvard University (AP Image) and US President Dnald Trump (File Image)





US President Donald Trump issued a proclamation suspending international visas for new Harvard University students, as announced by the White House on Wednesday. This action represents a significant intensification of efforts to prevent foreign students from attending this prestigious institution.The directive halts entry for new Harvard students under F, M, or J visa categories and instructs the Secretary of State to evaluate revoking existing visas for current students meeting specific criteria, according to the White House statement on Wednesday.Citing national security concerns, the White House expressed apprehension about Harvard's foreign connections. The administration criticised the university's alleged inadequate reporting of foreign student information, noting deficiencies in data submission for three students.The White House statement claimed Harvard either inadequately reports foreign student disciplinary records or insufficiently monitors these students. Additional criticisms included the university's handling of antisemitism and its continued emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).Also read: 'Retaliatory step': Trump blocks visas for new foreign students at Harvard; here's how the University responded The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has long warned that foreign adversaries take advantage of easy access to American higher education to steal information, exploit research and development, and spread false information, as per the White House.""Harvard has also developed extensive entanglements with foreign adversaries, receiving more than $150 million from China alone. In exchange, Harvard has, among other things, hosted Chinese Communist Party paramilitary members and partnered with China-based individuals on research that could advance China’s military modernization,"" the White House said in a statement.""Harvard has failed to adequately address violent anti-Semitic incidents on campus, with many of these agitators found to be foreign students."" it added.The President said that there are people who wants to go to Harvard but they can't get in because of foreign students. He also said that they are waiting for the foreign student lists from Harvard so that the administration can determine how many ""radicalized lunatics, troublemakers all"" should not be let back into the US.“The students? Well, we want to have great students here. We just don’t want students that are causing trouble. We want to have students. I want to have foreign students. We have people who want to go to Harvard and other schools, they can’t get in because we have foreign students there. But I want to make sure that the foreign students are people that can love our country,"" he said.“We are still waiting for the Foreign Student Lists from Harvard so that we can determine, after a ridiculous expenditure of BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, how many radicalized lunatics, troublemakers all, should not be let back into our Country. Harvard is very slow in the presentation of these documents, and probably for good reason!” Trump added.This development came after US District Court Judge Allison Burroughs's recent ruling, which indefinitely prevented the Trump administration from modifying Harvard's international student visa programme. This ruling came shortly after the judge temporarily stopped the administration's attempt to revoke the university's authority to enrol international students.The ongoing showdown stems from Harvard's refusal to submit to a series of federal government demands. The situation escalated recently after the department of homeland security said Harvard refused to provide records related to misconduct by foreign students.Trump had already froze more than $2.2 billion in funding and now had terminated $450 million in grants to the country's oldest university.Members of the Republican Party have introduced new bills aimed at substantially raising tax rates on endowments held by elite universities, with Harvard being a primary target. The former president had previously indicated his intention to revoke the university's tax exemption privileges.Following the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, the US President has repeatedly criticised the university for its perceived inadequate protection of Jewish students. In response, Harvard has broadened its legal challenge against the Trump administration, contesting both the suspension of federal funding and what the institution considers to be demands that compromise its autonomy and violate constitutional principles.",US President Donald Trump issued a proclamation suspending international visas for new Harvard University students.

NEW DELHI: At least 11 people died and 33 others were injured as a stampede occurred at Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru after a large number of people gathered to participate in the RCB victory celebrations. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the incident ""absolutely heartrending"" and prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured people. Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah held a press conference and announced Rs 10 lakh as compensation to the kin of those deceased. He also ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident.What was meant to be a day of jubilation turned tragic as a massive crowd gathered to celebrate Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s (RCB) first-ever Indian Premier League (IPL) title win. Scattered shoes, broken sandals, and torn pieces of sports jerseys littered the area, marking the aftermath of the chaos that unfolded when crowds spiralled out of control.Lakhs of young fans had converged outside the stadium with ""RCB"" chanting. Many were seen climbing trees, scaling walls, and clinging to poles in a desperate attempt to catch a glimpse of their cricketing idols.As excitement peaked, the situation turned dangerous.People began to fall, some losing consciousness. Panic spread quickly as the jubilant cheers turned into screams for help. Emergency services rushed the injured to nearby hospitals.Even amid the unfolding tragedy, groups of young fans were seen sitting atop compound walls near Saint Mark's Cathedral, cheering for RCB as sirens wailed and police tried to restore order.Despite a heavy deployment of police personnel, the sheer scale of the crowd overwhelmed security arrangements. Officials acknowledged they were heavily outnumbered by the surging masses.Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the stampede in Bengaluru as ""absolutely heartrending"". In a post on X, he said, ""The mishap in Bengaluru is absolutely heartrending. In this tragic hour, my thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that those who are injured have a speedy recovery.""President Droupadi Murmu also expressed deep sorrow over the loss of lives in a stampede and called the incident 'shocking and heartbreaking'.In a social media post on X, Droupadi Murmu wrote, ""The loss of lives in the tragic happening at a stadium in Bengaluru is shocking and heartbreaking. My condolences to the bereaved families and prayers for the speedy recovery of the injured.""Chief minister Siddaramaiah, while addressing a press conference gave details of the incident, saying that 11 lives were lost and 33 others were reported injured. He added that the stadium has capacity of hosting 35,000 people, but around two or three lakh people gathered to witness the event, and the crowd was unexpected.""11 are dead and 33 injured due to stampede near Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. More than 2-3 lakh people came, and no one expected this much crowd,"" Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah said at a press conference.Further, the CM said that he would not justify the mishap but drew comparisons with similar tragedies elsewhere, like in Kumbh Mela, as BJP criticised his government for the tragedy.""Such incidents happened in so many places. I am not going to defend this by comparing it with them now by saying it happened here and there. In Kumbh Mela, 50-60 people died, I didn't criticise it,"" he said.""If Congress criticises, then that is a different matter. Did I or the Karnataka government criticise?"" CM Siddaramaiah said.The BCCI called the incident shocking adding that the organisers should have been better-prepared.""It's most unfortunate, organisers should have planned RCB's IPL-winning celebrations better,"" BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia told PTI.""When one organises a victory celebration of this magnitude, proper precautions and security measures need to be taken,"" he added.IPL chairman Arun Dhumal said, ""Whatever inquiry that needs to be done, the concerned authorities will do that. It was not a BCCI event. It is sad and tragic.""According to eyewitnesses, fans thronged the venue of felicitation. Visuals showed police shifting the injured persons and those who had fallen unconscious to ambulances.Cops were seen using mild force to manage the crowd outside stadium. They had a tough time in crowd management as a large number of cricket enthusiasts tried to gain entry, at the same time, into the stadium.According to a traffic advisory from the Bengaluru police, entry to Chinnaswamy Stadium was limited to only those with valid tickets and passes. ""As there is limited parking facility available near the Chinnaswamy Stadium, those who are attending the event are advised to use public transport and Metro. The public is requested to cooperate,"" it had said.Karnataka BJP President BY Vijayendra arrived at Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital to meet the injured people.""The state government should take full responsibility for this tragedy. When the whole country and Karnataka were celebrating RCB's victory, the state government's haste to hold a victory rally without any prior preparations led to this tragedy. The state government never cared about prior preparations. They were more interested in publicity. This resulted in the death of more than 11 people. Some people are in ICU. I spoke to some victims, there was no police inside, no ambulance facility. The CM should send the matter for judicial investigation,"" Vijayendra said.The IPL champions and several political leaders, including Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah marked their presence at the victory parade.Also read: Tragedy at RCB's IPL 2025 victory parade: KSCA, franchise break silence on stamped",Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the incident 'absolutely heartrending' Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah held a press conference and announced Rs 10 lakh as compensation to the kin of those deceased.

The announcement caught cops unawares as they had no communication about it. But it sent the already-electrified fanbase into overdrive.Then came the colossal collective failure: Police honchos failed to act swiftly and draw up crowd-control plans. Politicians turned the celebration into a photo-op frenzy, brushing aside warnings in their race to bask in reflected glory.

NEW DELHI: What was supposed to be a jubilant occasion to celebrate Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s (RCB) first-ever IPL title turned into a tragedy on Wednesday. A deadly stampede near Chinnaswamy Stadium claimed at least 11 lives and left over 30 injured, with two in critical condition. The chaotic scenes have sparked political uproar, a magisterial inquiry, and a call for accountability.Here are the top developments from the scenes:Thousands of RCB fans swarmed the stadium gates and surrounding areas in anticipation of the victory celebrations after RCB’s historic IPL 2025 win. The huge crowd overwhelmed police and security personnel, leading to a deadly stampede near the gates.According to police, eight people died immediately after being rushed to Bowring Hospital, while the death toll later rose to 11. At least 33 others were injured, with several admitted to ICUs.Authorities had deployed a large police contingent, but controlling the massive crowd proved difficult. At Vidhana Soudha, where the felicitation program was held, Karnataka police resorted to mild cane-charge to disperse surging fans.Several people attempted to climb gates, trees, and fences to catch a glimpse of players.Deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar told the media, “I have spoken to the Police Commissioner and everyone. I will also go to the hospital later. I do not want to disturb the doctors right now. The exact number [of casualties] cannot be told now. We appeal to the people to remain calm.”He added, “We shortened the program. It ended within 10 minutes. We are trying to make everything normal... lakhs of people came.”On BJP’s allegations of mishandling, Shivakumar said, “They are there to allege and we are there to protect… Yes, I am going to the hospital.”Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah expressed deep sorrow and said, “This tragedy should not have happened. The government expresses deep sorrow. Most of the deceased are youth.”He announced Rs 10 lakh compensation for families of the deceased and free treatment for the injured.“I don't want to defend this incident. Our government will not do politics on this. I have ordered a magisterial inquiry and given 15 days' time. People even broke the gates of the stadium. There was a stampede. No one expected such a huge crowd. The stadium has a capacity of only 35,000 people, but 2-3 lakh people came,” Siddaramaiah said.In a social media post, the CM wrote, “The pain of this tragedy has even erased the joy of victory. May the souls of the deceased rest in peace, and may the injured recover soon. My condolences to the bereaved families. I appeal to the public to prioritise safety above everything else.”BJP Karnataka president BY Vijayendra slammed the state government, alleging poor planning and lack of preparedness. “The state government should take full responsibility for this tragedy. When the whole country and Karnataka were celebrating RCB’s victory, the state government’s haste to hold a victory rally without preparations led to this. More than 11 people have died. There was no police inside, no ambulance facility. The CM should order a judicial investigation.”BJP MLC Chalavadi Narayanaswamy called the incident a “clear security failure,” saying the government underestimated the crowd size and ignored necessary precautions.Congress leaders expressed their condolences and called for stronger safety protocols.Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge said, “I am deeply saddened by the tragic stampede. My thoughts and prayers are with the families who lost loved ones, and I wish a speedy recovery to the injured.”Rahul Gandhi called the tragedy “heartbreaking” and said, “This tragedy is a painful reminder: no celebration is worth a human life. Every safety protocol for public events must be reviewed and strictly enforced — lives must always come first.”AIMIM Chief Asaduddin Owaisi termed the incident “very unfortunate and heartbreaking” and called for major preventive steps to avoid such tragedies.Union minister HD Kumaraswamy said that the Congress government must take full responsibility, calling the tragedy a result of “lack of proper planning and complete failure to take precautionary measures.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed grief in a social media post, saying, “The mishap in Bengaluru is absolutely heartrending. My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that those who are injured have a speedy recovery.”Fans trapped outside described a “nightmarish” experience. One fan said, “Inside, all the seats are full, and they’re not letting us go in. We want to go back, but we aren’t allowed to. The gates are crowded, and if they open them, more people will rush in. A lot of people have been injured already.”One fan trying to climb a gate to get in fell and broke his leg. Several others climbed trees and fences for a view of the players.BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia criticized the lack of preparedness, saying, “When one organises a victory celebration of this magnitude… safety and security measures need to be taken.”The hastily arranged program sold tickets quickly but security failed to manage the crowds at gates 10, 12, and 13. Police eventually closed gates to prevent ticketless fans from entering, further escalating tensions.Anticipating large crowds, the Karnataka government had cancelled a victory roadshow citing security concerns. The stampede raises questions about the adequacy of the alternative arrangements.BJP national spokespersons Shehzad Poonawalla and Pradeep Bhandari accused the Congress government of “state-sponsored negligence” and “criminal negligence,” demanding accountability from chief minister Siddaramaiah and home minister G Parameshwara.","RCB fans swarmed the stadium gates and surrounding areas in anticipation of the victory celebrations after RCB’s historic IPL 2025 win.

NEW DELHI: A political slugfest erupted between the BJP and the Congress in Karnataka after a celebratory event for Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s IPL victory turned into a deadly stampede in Bengaluru. As the BJP slammed the Congress-led state government for ""gross negligence"" and ""publicity-driven haste"" that led to the loss of lives, deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar defended the decision to continue the event after stampede saying the program was shortened to just 10 minutes.Speaking to the media, Shivakumar said, “I have spoken to the police commissioner and everyone.

Lakhs of people came.”The stampede, which broke out due to overcrowding and alleged mismanagement at the event, has reportedly claimed eight lives and left at least 40 others injured.Responding to the BJP’s criticism over the incident, the Deputy CM remarked, “They are there to allege and we are there to protect... yes, I am going to the hospital.”The BJP accused the Congress-led Karnataka government of gross negligence and administrative failure. BJP IT Cell chief Amit Malviya took to social media platform X on Wednesday to express shock and anger over the incident that claimed seven lives and left several injured, many critically. “Tragic stampede in Bengaluru. A celebration has turned into a nightmare,” Malviya posted. “This heartbreaking incident could have been avoided. The lack of basic administrative foresight and failure in crowd control by the state government has led to an irreparable loss,” he said. Malviya further demanded accountability, stating, “Lives were lost due to negligence, not chance.”Karnataka BJP president BY Vijayendra also questioned the ""haste"" to hold victory parade.

NEW DELHI: If Justice Yashwant Varma doesn't resign and holds on to his argument of being ""innocent"", he may earn the unenviable distinction of being the only judge to be removed through Parliament's removal motion, with most parties pledging ""unity"" on the issue of corruption, of which the three-member SC panel has found him guilty.Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said most of opposition parties favoured bringing the motion of removal, which may be introduced in the monsoon session (July 21 to Aug 12).Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said most of parties favoured bringing the motion of removal, which, by all accounts, may be introduced in the forthcoming monsoon session, scheduled from July 21 to Aug 12. Rijiju said Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs (CCPA) has sent the recommendation for the monsoon session to President Droupadi Murmu.The minister said although opposition parties would formally respond in a couple of days, he had been assured of their support and was confident of the same, as there was no scope for politicking as corruption in the judiciary could not be approached through a ""political prism"".Rijiju said he would also reach out to smaller parties as govt wants all parties to ""jointly"" move the motion.""Govt feels the matter related to corruption is not one political party's agenda. It is a stand of all parties to fight against the menace of corruption, whether it is the judiciary or any other space,"" he said.He , however, said the decision on which House the motion would be brought in - LS or RS - would be taken based on the business of each House.According to the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, once a motion to remove a judge is admitted in any of the Houses, the Speaker or the Chairman, as the case may be, will constitute a three-member committee to investigate the grounds on which the removal has been sought.The committee will consist of the CJI or an SC judge, an HC chief justice and a ""distinguished jurist"".Meanwhile, Congress said govt had announced dates for the monsoon session 47 days in advance to run away from the opposition's demand for an immediate special session to discuss Pahalgam terror attack and Centre's ""failure"" to bring the terrorists to justice, the impact of Operation Sindoor and its ""blatant politicisation"".","If Justice Yashwant Varma doesn't resign and holds on to his argument of being ""innocent"", he may earn the unenviable distinction of being the only judge to be removed through Parliament's removal motion.

The agency also confiscated his mobile phones and land documents.Khan, who had retired on March 31, 2018, appeared before CBI in Chandigarh, where he cooperated with the investigation, but requested for the return of his passport.However, the regional passport officer in Srinagar informed him on Feb 3, 2023, that his travel document had been impounded under section 10(3)(c) of the Passports Act, citing national security concerns.Khan filed an application seeking release of his passport before the CBI special court, stating he was a senior citizen and intended to go for Hajj pilgrimage. On Sept 11, 2024, the CBI court released the other articles seized during the raid, but held that the passport could not be released.Khan challenged the order in HC, arguing that he was not involved in any act prejudicial to India’s security and that his passport had been held for over three years without any charges being filed.CBI opposed the plea, stating that his role had been established in the “conspiracy for issuance of arms licences illegally in view of the monetary considerations”.The probe agency said it had sought sanction for his prosecution as of Oct 30, 2023, which was still awaited.The HC said the respondents had failed to place any material on record to indicate that the impounding of the petitioner’s passport was with regard to the security concerns of J&K and that it was necessary in the interest of the country’s security.The right to travel abroad was an important human right, for it nourished the independent and self-determining creative character of the individual, the high court stated, citing a Supreme Court judgment.","CBI had seized the passport of Sajad Ahmad Khan during a raid at his residence Oct 12, 2021, in connection with an investigation into the illegal issuance of arms licences.

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi on Wednesday delivered a scathing rebuke of Pakistan and its political-military establishment during a public address in Brussels, targeting former Pakistan Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari without naming him.Referring to Bhutto's remarks, Chaturvedi said, “The person who is leading the delegation, in his parliamentary speech, said ‘Kon raat ke andhere mein hamle karte hain, Buzdil raat ke waqt hamle karte hain’... ‘Buzdil’ are those who do a coup on an elected government and after sending them to jail, murder the elected Prime Minister, so that the army can control the government.”Her comments referenced Bhutto's remarks on India's military response to Islamabad's terror attacks. Chaturvedi flipped that accusation, linking true cowardice to Pakistan's history of military coups and political assassinations, including the killing of Benazir Bhutto and the ousting of Imran Khan.In a sharp critique of the Pakistani state’s support for terrorism , she called on the international community to confront Islamabad’s role. “It is high time that we ask the international community to stand up in unison and call out this kind of terror activities emanating from Pakistan...Pakistan has become a hub, the economic model to use terrorism as a way to try and hold the world to ransom... Call them out in the UNSC... till you don't call them out, this is a failed fight against terrorism that the European Union is running. ”She highlighted India’s resilience against Pakistan across fields—from military conflict to cricket—saying, “We have decades of experience of showing them their place.

NEW DELHI: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi , who was part of a multi-party delegation led by BJP MP Baijayant Panda to four Gulf countries, launched a scathing attack on Pakistan on Wednesday, accusing it of sponsoring terrorism through illicit financial networks and promoting extremist ideologies.Speaking to news agency ANI, Owaisi described Pakistan as the “epicentre of Takfirism” and alleged that its government, deep state, and intelligence agency ISI were complicit in funding terror groups. “We represented India over there... and told them Pakistan has been indulging in terrorism in India for many years,” he said.He added that the Resistance Front, which was behind the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack , was essentially a front for Lashkar-e-Taiba , and India's concerns had already been conveyed to the United Nations Security Council’s 1262 sanctions committee.Owaisi further referred to Pakistani Army Chief Asim Munir’s speech on April 15, implying its alignment with extremist ideology. “Terrorism survives on two things, ideology and money,” he said, urging the international community to act on both fronts. “A form of polio exists only in two countries, Afghanistan and Pakistan… there is 40% poverty in Pakistan, so where is the money going?”He noted that the four nations visited, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Algeria, were part of groups like the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), and Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENAFATF), and had previously backed India’s diplomatic push to place Pakistan on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list in 2018.During their stop in Algeria, Owaisi reiterated that “there is no ideological difference between the terrorist groups in Pakistan and Daesh and Al-Qaeda”. He stressed that Islam does not permit violence and said the international community must act against countries that provide ideological and financial shelter to terrorists.He also said that placing Pakistan back on the FATF grey list would significantly reduce terror attacks in India. “Once you bring Pakistan back in the grey list, we will see a decrease in terrorism in India… we have the 2018 experience when Algeria and other countries helped India,” he said.Referring to the case of 26/11 handler Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, Owaisi added, “The trial progressed immediately when Pakistan was put on the Grey list. That tells you how effective FATF can be.”The eight-member delegation, including MPs Nishikant Dubey, Phangnon Konyak, Rekha Sharma, Satnam Singh Sandhu, Ghulam Nabi Azad, and former foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla, met leaders and think tanks in the four countries to highlight India’s stand on terrorism, particularly following the Pahalgam attack and Operation Sindoor.According to news agency PTI, the delegation also presented its feedback to external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday.Jaishankar reportedly congratulated the delegation and said the objectives of the visit were fulfilled. “All four countries have taken clear steps against terrorism and understand India’s principled stand,” said Panda.",All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi launched a scathing attack on Pakistan on Wednesday.

Trump's order partially restricts travel from 7 other countries: Which are they?

Burundi: According to the White House citing Overstay Report, Burundi had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 15.35 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 17.52 percent.

Cuba: The US called Cuba, a state sponsor of terrorism, and said that their government does not cooperate or share sufficient law enforcement information with the United States. ""Cuba has historically refused to accept back its removable nationals. According to the Overstay Report, Cuba had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 7.69 percent and a F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 18.75 percent,"" the White House said in a statement.

Laos: According to the White House citing Overstay Report, Laos had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 34.77 percent and a F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 6.49 percent. Laos has historically failed to accept back its removable nationals.

Sierra Leone: ""According to the Overstay Report, Sierra Leone had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 15.43 percent and a F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 35.83 percent. Sierra Leone has historically failed to accept back its removable nationals,"" the White House said in a statement.

Togo: The United States claimed that the Togo had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 19.03 percent and a F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 35.05 percent.

Turkmenistan: According to the White House citing Overstay Report, Turkmenistan had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 15.35 percent and a F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 21.74 percent.

Venezuela: As per the White House's statement, Venezuela lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures. Venezuela has historically refused to accept back its removable nationals. According to the Overstay Report, Venezuela had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 9.83 percent.





US President Donald Trump issued a proclamation implementing a travel ban on nationals from 12 countries, citing national security risks, according to the White House.""The Proclamation fully restricts and limits the entry of nationals from 12 countries found to be deficient with regard to screening and vetting and determined to pose a very high risk to the United States,"" the White House said in a statement.White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson posted on X: ""President Trump is fulfilling his promise to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors that want to come to our country and cause us harm.""During his initial presidency, Trump introduced restrictions on travellers from seven predominantly Muslim countries, a policy that underwent several revisions before receiving Supreme Court approval in 2018, Reuters reported. However, his successor, Democratic President Joe Biden, abolished these restrictions in 2021, stating it was ""a stain on our national conscience."": The US said that Afghanistan, which is under the control of Taliban - designated as SDGT group, has no effective central authority to handle passport issuance or civil documentation. The nation also lacks proper screening and vetting protocols.The White House statement referenced the Fiscal Year 2023 DHS Entry/Exit Overstay Report, which revealed that Afghan nationals had a 9.70 percent overstay rate for business/tourist (B1/B2) visas.Additionally, the report indicated a significantly higher overstay rate of 29.30 percent for student (F), vocational (M), and exchange visitor (J) visa categories.: According to the US citing Overstay Report, Burma had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 27.07 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 42.17 percent. Additionally, Burma has historically not cooperated with the United States to accept back their removable nationals.: ""According to the Overstay Report, Chad had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 49.54 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 55.64 percent. According to the Fiscal Year 2022 Overstay Report, Chad had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 37.12 percent. The high visa overstay rate for 2022 and 2023 is unacceptable and indicates a blatant disregard for US immigration laws,"" as per the statement released by the White House.: As per the US, the Republic of the Congo exhibited significant visa overstay percentages, as detailed in the Overstay Report. The data revealed that 29.63 percent of B1/B2 visa holders remained beyond their authorised stay. Additionally, for academic-related visas (F, M, and J categories), the overstay rate was notably higher at 35.14 percent.: ""According to the Overstay Report, Equatorial Guinea had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 21.98 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 70.18 percent,"" the statement read.: The United States questions the competence of the central authority for issuance of passports or civil documents in Eritrea. Criminal records are not available to the United States for Eritrean nationals. Eritrea has historically refused to accept back its removable nationals. According to the Overstay Report, Eritrea had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 20.09 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 55.43 percent.: According to the White House citing Overstay Report, Haiti had a B1/B2 visa overstay rate of 31.38 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 25.05 percent. The statement also claimed that hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden administration. This influx harms American communities by creating acute risks of increased overstay rates, establishment of criminal networks, and other national security threats.The US also said that the Haiti lacks a central authority with sufficient availability and dissemination of law enforcement information necessary to ensure its nationals do not undermine the national security of the United States.: The United States Government has designated Iran as a nation that supports terrorist activities. According to the White House statement, Iran consistently demonstrates non-cooperation with American authorities in identifying potential security threats. Additionally, the country serves as a significant source of global terrorism and has shown a persistent unwillingness to accept the return of its deportable citizens.: According to the US, Libya lacks a functioning central government capable of issuing reliable passports and civil documentation. The nation's ongoing challenges with terrorist organisations operating within its borders heighten security concerns regarding the admission of Libyan nationals into the United States.: ""Somalia lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures. Somalia stands apart from other countries in the degree to which its government lacks command and control of its territory, which greatly limits the effectiveness of its national capabilities in a variety of respects,"" the White House said in a statement.According to the US, the persistent terrorist threat emanates from Somalia’s territory. The United States Government has identified Somalia as a terrorist safe haven. Terrorists use regions of Somalia as safe havens from which they plan, facilitate, and conduct their operations. Somalia also remains a destination for individuals attempting to join terrorist groups that threaten the national security of the United States.""The Government of Somalia struggles to provide governance needed to limit terrorists’ freedom of movement. Additionally, Somalia has historically refused to accept back its removable nationals,"" the statement reads.: According to the US, the nation faces significant challenges in document verification due to the absence of an effective central governing body responsible for passport and civil documentation issuance. The country also lacks proper screening protocols, as stated by the White House.: In a statement, the White House said that Yemen operates without an efficient central authority to manage passport and civil document issuance, alongside inadequate screening procedures. It also said that their inability to maintain territorial control compounds these issues. Since January 20, 2025, Yemen has been experiencing ongoing US military activities within its borders.The Proclamation partially also restrict and limit the entry of nationals from 7 countries who also pose a high level of risk to the United States.","US President Donald Trump issued a proclamation implementing a travel ban on nationals from 12 countries, citing national security risks.

We are not clear yet about the sequence of the events. We are looking for the wife. The entire society, community and stakeholders have gotten involved in this. We are leaving no stones unturned to find her.""Both families, however, demand that the probe be handed to CBI and the search to Army. ""Police there start work at 10am and are done by 4pm.

Govind said: ""Police are only searching near the area where Raja's body was found - focusing on recovering a dead body instead of trying to find her alive.""Govind said the search couldn't proceed as planned on Wednesday due to bad weather.""They are searching the jungle, but it seems they are not making any real attempt to locate Sonam alive. She has been kidnapped. There have been similar incidents in the past as well, which were suppressed. This is a case of abduction, but the authorities are not changing their search area. It appears police have already given up,"" Govind told TOI.The duo recalled an unsettling encounter with a local when Raja's body had not been found. Near Double Decker Bridge, the last known location of the honeymooning couple, a local man allegedly warned them not to defame Meghalaya. ""Local police refuse to acknowledge something serious has happened. I saw everything firsthand. If CBI takes over, Raja's killers can definitely be caught,"" said Vipin.He alleged that the administration did not cooperate for the first eight days. ""Police kept lying to us, saying they had twice searched the place where Raja's body was eventually found. Had they done so, Raja's body could have been recovered much sooner.""Vipin fears Sonam has been abducted. ""Girls are trafficked there. Local people hold more power than police. Police haven't yet touched the people I suspect. We suspect the man who rented the scooter to Raja was involved. His friends came to meet us. There's a gang operating there, and local police are aware of it, but are refusing to share information.""East Khasi Hills SP Vivek Syiem has, however, said locals have been very helpful in the search. ""Such incidents will affect them adversely and they are very concerned that this has happened. Because of the locals and rescue teams, we could cover 150 sq km in our search for the victims,"" he said on Tuesday.Heavy rain and the treacherous terrain have made the search very difficult, say Meghalaya authorities.Sohra SDPO Pynhun Syiem is leading the search team that comprises NDRF, SDRF, SRT, fire and emergency services (FES), Special Investigation Team (SIT) and dozens of local volunteers.The Meghalaya CM said, ""This is a very unfortunate incident, something we haven't seen in Meghalaya before. It has taken all of us by surprise. Even local people and stakeholders in the tourism sector are very surprised. Meghalaya has always been a tourist-friendly area. We have always ensured the safety of tourists. This is something very out of the ordinary for us also.""Meghalaya tourism minister Paul Lyngdoh urged the public not to jump to conclusions as the investigation is still on. Calling the incident ""unprecedented and shocking,"" Lyngdoh said the ""full picture has yet to emerge"".Lyngdoh reassured the public and tourists that Meghalaya remains a safe and welcoming destination.","Raja Raghuvanshi was found hacked to death and thrown into a deep gorge in Sohra (Cherrapunjee), Meghalaya.

Who is Lee Jae Myung? South Korea's new president and his rags to riches story,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/who-is-lee-jae-myung-south-koreas-new-president-and-his-rags-to-riches-story/articleshow/121629092.cms,"Who is Lee Jae-myung?





Lee Jae-myung is once again in the spotlight after winning South Korea’s presidential election . After the country’s former president, Yoon Suk Yeol, was impeached for trying to impose martial law, Lee became the leading candidate to take over.Lee, from the opposition Democratic Party, became a central figure during the political crisis last December, when he live-streamed himself jumping over the fence of the National Assembly to help stop Yoon’s emergency order. “It was a race against time,” he later said in an interview with news agency AFP.Earlier this year, Lee survived a knife attack at a public event. The man who stabbed him admitted he wanted to kill Lee to stop him from becoming president.The 60 years old Lee grew up in poverty and had to quit school early to work in a factory. He injured his arm in an accident there but went on to earn a scholarship, study law, and become a lawyer. His life story, from hardship to high office, earned him strong support among working-class voters.Lee first entered politics as mayor of Seongnam, just south of Seoul. He shut down South Korea’s biggest dog meat market, which once sold 80,000 dogs a year.Later, as governor of Gyeonggi Province, the country’s most populated region, he built a reputation for being outspoken and bold.However, he’s also faced many controversies. He’s currently fighting corruption charges linked to a property deal and is accused of spreading false information during the 2022 election, which he narrowly lost. His rival, Kim Moon-soo of the conservative People Power Party, says Lee should not be allowed to run, “With these kinds of corruption allegations, how can you seek public office?” he said in a debate.Lee’s wife, Kim Hye-kyung, has defended him. “He’s someone who’s come up from the very bottom,” she said. “Just like how a flea has to jump to be noticed, I hope people can understand and view him in that context.”Before elections, Lee said that he wanted to advance South Korea’s artificial intelligence industry and punish those involved in the failed martial law attempt.","Lee Jae-myung is the winner of South Korea's presidential election.

"Political shift: Karine Jean-Pierre quits Democratic Party; Biden-era press secretary to detail ‘broken' White House in new book, says publisher",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/political-shift-karine-jean-pierre-quits-democratic-party-biden-era-press-secretarys-memoir-to-detail-broken-white-house-says-publisher/articleshow/121631174.cms,"



Karine Jean-Pierre, White House press secretary in the Joe Biden administration (2021-2025) has left the Democratic Party and is writing a candid memoir about the “broken” White House she once served, according to the book's publisher.""Jean-Pierre didn’t come to her decision to be an Independent lightly. She has served two American presidents, Obama and Biden. In 2020, she joined Biden’s campaign as a senior adviser, becoming Harris’s chief of staff and then, two years later, White House press secretary. She takes us through the three weeks that led to Biden’s abandoning his bid for a second term and the betrayal by the Democratic Party that led to his decision,"" states the publisher Hachette Book Group, providing details on its website.The 50-year-old communications veteran, who was the first Black woman and openly gay person to hold the press secretary role, revealed her book Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines is scheduled for release on October 21 through Legacy Lit, a Hachette Book Group imprint.“Until January 20, I was responsible for speaking on behalf of the President of the United States,” Jean-Pierre said Wednesday, according to statement quoted by the Associated Press.“At noon on that day, I became a private citizen who, like all Americans and many of our allies around the world, had to contend with what was to come next for our country. I determined that the danger we face as a country requires freeing ourselves of boxes. We need to be willing to exercise the ability to think creatively and plan strategically,"" she further added, according to the statement.Jean-Pierre’s departure from the Democratic Party is described by her publisher as a thoughtful evolution rather than a sudden break. Legacy Lit teased that the memoir will detail the three-week period leading to Biden’s surprising decision to withdraw from his 2024 re-election bid - a choice Jean-Pierre attributes partly to a “betrayal by the Democratic Party.” The book also reportedly aims to expose insider perspectives on combating electoral misinformation and offers insights on why an increasing number of Americans are rejecting traditional party labels.“In a hard-hitting yet hopeful critique, Jean-Pierre defines what it means to be part of the growing percentage of our fractured electorate that is Independent,” the publisher’s statement reads. “Why it can be worthwhile to carve a political space more loyal to personal beliefs than a party affiliation, and what questions you need to ask yourself to determine where you fit politically.”Jean-Pierre, who joined Biden’s campaign as senior adviser in 2020 and replaced Jen Psaki as press secretary in 2022, faced sustained criticism during her White House tenure. Her repeated defenses of Biden’s mental acuity — including claims that the president was “sharp as ever” despite mounting doubts- sparked skepticism both inside and outside the administration.In one contentious briefing, she asserted that Biden’s mention of the late Republican congresswoman Jackie Walorski was because the lawmaker was “top of mind,” a defense met with incredulity by the press corps. She also survived an internal effort in late 2023 led by then-White House communications chief Anita Dunn to oust her, amid dissatisfaction with her performance. “She doesn’t have a grasp of the issues and doesn’t spend the time to learn,” a White House insider said at the time. Despite this, Biden stood by Jean-Pierre throughout, valuing her historic role as the first non-white and openly gay press secretary.Jean-Pierre ended her tenure with an emotional farewell briefing in January that caused friction among aides after she declined to share the stage with National Security Council spokesman John Kirby during a major hostage release announcement. “She basically said it was her goodbye party,” a source said. “She kinda marketed it as a celebration of her and her tenure, and unfortunately, that took precedence over huge breaking news. ”The forthcoming memoir is already drawing sharp reactions from Democratic circles. One senior Democrat dismissed the book as proof of “incompetence, not independence,” while another admitted they “can’t look away”.Jean-Pierre herself teased the book on Instagram Wednesday, urging voters to “stop thinking in boxes and think outside of our boxes, and not be so partisan … this book Independent, it’s about looking outside of boxes, not just always being in a partisan stance.”Independent aims to join the small canon of White House press secretary memoirs that peel back the curtain on presidential administrations, including Scott McClellan’s 2008 bestseller What Happened, which famously criticized President George W. Bush’s leadership.","Karine Jean-Pierre, White House press secretary in the Joe Biden administration (2021-2025) has left the Democratic Party.

The United States on Wednesday exercised its veto power against a UN Security Council resolution calling for an ""immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire"" between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, alongside unrestricted humanitarian aid access. The remaining 14 council members supported the draft as Gaza's population faces severe humanitarian challenges.""The United States has been clear: We would not support any measure that fails to condemn Hamas and does not call for Hamas to disarm and leave Gaza,"" acting US ambassador Dorothy Shea said, suggesting it would compromise American-led ceasefire negotiations.As Israel's primary ally and weapons provider, Washington's position remains significant. The vote occurred amidst continued Israeli operations in Gaza following a March truce termination. Gaza health officials reported 45 casualties from Israeli strikes, whilst Israel confirmed one military casualty.British UN ambassador Barbara Woodward criticised Israel's expanded military actions and aid restrictions as ""unjustifiable, disproportionate and counterproductive."" Israel maintains its opposition to permanent ceasefire terms.Israel's UN ambassador Danny Danon addressed supporting members: ""You chose appeasement and submission. You chose a road that does not lead to peace. Only to more terror.""Hamas criticised the American veto as demonstrating ""the US administration's blind bias"" towards Israel. The resolution had also demanded immediate hostage release from Hamas.The conflict intensified after Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack, resulting in 1,200 Israeli casualties and 250 hostages. Israel's response has caused over 54,000 Palestinian deaths, predominantly civilians, according to Gaza authorities.Limited UN aid resumed May 19, followed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's distribution system. Israel alleges Hamas diverts aid, which Hamas denies. The US and Israel encourage UN cooperation with GHF, which employs private American security firms.""No one wants to see Palestinian civilians in Gaza go hungry or thirsty,"" Shea stated, noting the resolution ignored previous aid delivery shortcomings. UN organisations reject GHF collaboration, citing neutrality concerns.GHF operations paused Wednesday following Tuesday's incident, requesting enhanced Israeli military support for civilian safety. The foundation reported distributing over seven million meals since inception.UN aid chief Tom Fletcher advocated for unrestricted humanitarian access. Slovenia's ambassador Samuel Zbogar expressed frustration with civilian suffering. A similar resolution may proceed to the UN General Assembly, where passage appears likely without veto powers.Danon concluded: ""Don't waste more of your time, because no resolution, no vote, no moral failure, will stand in our way.""","The United States exercised its veto power against a UN Security Council resolution calling for an ""immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire"" The remaining 14 council members supported the draft as Gaza's population faces severe humanitarian challenges.

On ESPN's First Take, sports commentator Stephen A. Smith made a surprising move by discussing geopolitics, saying that if he were the President of the United States, he would stand with Ukraine against Russian aggression. He noted, “I know that Russia's ultimate quest is to recapture Europe and I don't want that to happen. Therefore I would help out Ukraine”.In the recent First Take episode, co-host Molly Qerim asked Smith a playful question: would he choose to be the head coach of the New York Knicks or the President of the United States? Smith humorously opted for the presidency, mentioning he’d prefer not to work with Knicks owner James Dolan.However, the conversation took a serious turn when fellow analyst Chris ""Mad Dog"" Russo challenged Smith on whether he could handle international disputes, particularly the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Smith firmly asserted his dedication to backing Ukraine against Russian expansionism.Smith recently shared on his show what he thought about Vladimir Putin ’s wish to recover Soviet-era territories. He showed that Russia’s actions put Europe’s stability in danger and that the U.S.must do something to meet them. Robert D. Smith brings to mind what many analysts around the world have been saying about Russia's plans.Smith's political commentary has sparked a variety of reactions from the public.

While another said, “Russia never controlled Europe so not sure where this perspective came from.”Regardless of the criticism, Smith's statements have certainly widened his public image, shifting from a sports analyst to a voice on global affairs.Also Read: Phoenix Suns hire Cleveland Cavaliers assistant Jordan Ott as head coach after Devin Booker endorses him Additionally, Smith is enhancing his media footprint with a new partnership with SiriusXM, on top of his TV and podcast appearances.

SHILLONG/INDORE: Indore honeymooner Raja Raghuvanshi , whose decomposed body was found in a gorge of Weisawdong falls Monday after he disappeared with his wife Sonam on May 23, had been hacked to death with a 'dao' (machete), police said on Tuesday.Meanwhile, the couple's families demanded a CBI probe and for the Army to lead the search for Sonam.""There is no doubt it was a murder. We have recovered a 'dao'. It was new and used for this very purpose,"" East Khasi Hills SP Vivek Syiem said, adding a search for the criminals was on. The victim's mobile had also been found.SP Syiem said the autopsy report was awaited to determine if Raja's death occurred before or after falling into the gorge. ""We can't rule out any possibility. Whether the motive was robbery, vendetta or any form of hatred or issue between the accused and the victims, we need to find that out. We need to look for more evidence before coming to a conclusion,"" the SP added.He said the probe was being given highest priority. ""Tomorrow, we will resume search for the wife in the adjoining area as the gorge extends quite a distance,"" he added. A woman's white shirt, the broken screen of a mobile and a strip of medicines were found near Raja's body.His smartwatch was still on his wrist, but his wallet, gold chain, rings and the couple's four mobile phones were missing,"" said the SP.Raja's brother, Vipin, who has been part of the search operations in Meghalaya, said, ""There should be a CBI investigation into the case."" He alleged that some 'suspects' were trying to mislead investigators about the crime scene.Raja’s mother shared her last conversation with Sonam just before the couple went missing. She had called to check in on her as May 23 was Gyaras, a fasting day. She asked the newlywed to eat something as they were hiking, but Sonam refused, saying, “Ghumne ke chakkar main vrat thodi tod dungi (Just because I am vacationing. I won’t break my fast).”The family shared a recording of this call in which Sonam sounds short of breath, telling her mother-inlaw that they were trekking in the forest to see a waterfall. The call ends abruptly, with Sonam saying she would talk later. That call never came.Vipin said they had been asking with police to search the very area where the body was found but their pleas went unheeded for several crucial days.They also allege that some ‘suspects’ are trying to mislead investigators about the actual crime scene.The family has voiced suspicion on some locals, but the SP said all the locals have been questioned and there is no possibility of their involvement.“It is true that the couple had a dispute with a female coffee vendor but it is not possible that she or other local vendors planned this murder so meticulously,” Syiem told TOI on Tuesday.The family, however, argues that it would be nearly impossible for someone unfamiliar with the area to reach the location where Raja’s body was found.The body was spotted by a drone in a deep gorge below Wei Sawdong falls at Riat Arliang parking lot.“This area has been closed for two years and there is a boundary wall around the parking lot. It seems he was attacked and thrown,” said Vipin. He told TOI that they were making arrangements to bring the body back to Indore.

Who is Geert Wilders? The ‘Right Wing Messiah’ quits Dutch government over immigration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/who-is-geert-wilders-the-right-wing-messiah-quits-dutch-government-over-immigration/articleshow/121622419.cms,"Geert Wilders: A polarising and popular figure in Netherlands

Fury from coalition partners

What happens next for the Netherlands?





The Netherlands has been thrown into political upheaval after Geert Wilders, the far-right populist leader of the Party for Freedom (PVV), pulled his party out of the ruling coalition over disagreements on immigration and asylum policy. This decision, made less than a year after the government was formed, forced Prime Minister Dick Schoof to resign and triggered the collapse of the most right wing administration in Dutch history. Wilders, often dubbed the “Dutch Trump,” cited his unyielding stance on asylum as the reason behind his party’s withdrawal, marking another dramatic turn in his long and polarising political career.Geert Wilders, 61, is one of the most recognised figures in European far right politics. He left the liberal conservative VVD in 2004 to establish the PVV, shaping it into a platform for his anti-Islam, anti-immigration beliefs. Often controversial, Wilders has repeatedly called for banning the Quran and Islamic schools and has openly criticised Dutch multiculturalism. His provocative rhetoric and polarising stances have kept him at the forefront of Dutch politics for two decades, despite multiple legal and political setbacks.In November 2023, Wilders led the PVV to a surprise victory, securing 37 seats and becoming the largest party in parliament. Although coalition partners blocked him from becoming prime minister due to his extreme views, Wilders held significant influence over policy from behind the scenes. The resulting government, a fragile coalition between the PVV, VVD, NSC and BBB, was always tense, and the immigration dispute only widened existing cracks.At the heart of the collapse was Wilders’ hardline 10-point asylum plan. His proposals included deporting all Syrian refugees, militarising borders, suspending EU asylum quotas and banning refugee family reunification. Legal experts argued that many of these violated international human rights agreements. When his coalition partners rejected the proposals, Wilders announced that all PVV ministers would resign, triggering the government's collapse.Coalition leaders condemned Wilders' actions as reckless and self-serving. Dilan Yeşilgöz of the VVD called his withdrawal “super irresponsible,” while other leaders accused him of prioritising personal power over national stability. Prime Minister Dick Schoof described the move as “unnecessary and irresponsible,” lamenting the breakdown of consensus during a time of global instability.With the PVV’s exit, the coalition lost its majority and the Dutch government now operates in caretaker mode. New elections are expected in the autumn. The crisis has also delayed major international decisions, including preparations for a NATO summit and defence budget commitments. Meanwhile, Wilders has vowed to return even stronger in the next election, renewing ambitions to lead the country on his own terms.",The Netherlands has been thrown into political upheaval after Geert Wilders pulled his party out of the ruling coalition.

James Boasberg: US judge orders deported Venezuelans receive due process,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-judge-orders-deported-venezuelans-receive-due-process/articleshow/121637871.cms,"AI- Generative Image





WASHINGTON: A US federal judge ruled Wednesday that President Donald Trump's administration must allow over a hundred Venezuelans deported under an obscure wartime law to challenge accusations they are violent gang members.In a highly critical opinion, District Judge James Boasberg said the US government ""must facilitate"" the migrants' ability to contest their removal, without specifying what actions that would entail.Boasberg is one of several judges who has drawn Trump's ire for curtailing his efforts to wield broad executive power, after ruling against the initial migrant deportation flights.In March, the Trump administration invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to deport hundreds Venezuelan migrants by alleging they were members of the Tren de Aragua gang, expelling them to a notorious maximum security prison in El Salvador.Tren de Aragua has been designated a ""foreign terrorist organization"" by the Trump administration, but attorneys for several of the deported Venezuelans have said their clients were not gang members, had committed no crimes and were targeted largely on the basis of their tattoos.The Trump administration went ahead with the initial deportations of the alleged Tren de Aragua members under the AEA in March despite a restraining order from Boasberg blocking the move.Angered by Boasberg's ruling, Trump called in March for his impeachment.The US Supreme Court in May then blocked further deportations under the AEA, saying the deported migrants were not being given enough time to legally contest their removal.Three federal district court judges have ruled that Trump's use of the AEA to carry out deportations was unconstitutional, while one, a Trump appointee, said it was permissible.Boasberg on Wednesday offered no ruling on the legality of using the AEA to deport migrants, and acknowledged the deportees could be gang members.""But -- and this is the critical point -- there is simply no way to know for sure as (they) never had any opportunity to challenge the Government's say-so,"" he wrote in the filing.Boasberg opened his ruling by comparing the treatment of the Venezuelan deportees to the main character of ""The Trial"" by Franz Kafka.The government ""must facilitate"" the deportees ability to contest their removal, the judge said, adding that ""exactly what such facilitation must entail will be determined in future proceedings.""The Trump administration has claimed that it doesn't have the power to bring back the deported migrants, raising fears that its defiance of federal court orders was placing the country on the cusp of a constitutional crisis.","Judge James Boasberg says the US government ""must facilitate"" the migrants' ability to contest their removal.

SEOUL: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un told a visiting top Russian official that his country will ""unconditionally support"" Russia's war against Ukraine, the North's state media reported Thursday, the latest sign of expanding cooperation between the two nations.In April, the two countries officially confirmed North Korean troops' deployment to Russia for the first time, saying that soldiers of the two countries were fighting alongside each other to repel a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk border region. At the time, Russian President Vladimir Putin thanked North Korea's participation in the war and promised not to forget their sacrifices.In a meeting with Russian security council secretary Sergei Shoigu in Pyongyang on Wednesday, Kim affirmed that North Korea will ""unconditionally support the stand of Russia and its foreign policies in all the crucial international political issues including the Ukrainian issue,"" the official Korean Central News Agency said.The two discussed how to solidify strategic partnership between North Korea and Russia and reached a consensus on the Ukraine issue and other unspecified international situations, KCNA said. It didn't elaborate.Russia's state Tass news agency, citing the Russian security council's press service, reported that Shoigu and Kim also discussed prospects for rebuilding the Kursk region and outlined steps to commemorate the contribution made by North Korean soldiers.Russia claimed in April 2025 that it had fully reclaimed the Kursk region, though Ukraine insists it still has troops present there. Ukraine's top army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi reiterated Saturday that Ukrainian forces were still holding territory in Russia's Kursk region.Shoigu last visited North Korea in March for a meeting with Kim.North Korea and Russia haven't said how many North Korean troops are in Russia.

Trump orders inquiry into 'conspiracy' to hide Biden's health decline,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-orders-inquiry-into-conspiracy-to-hide-bidens-health-decline/articleshow/121637416.cms,"Trump orders inquiry into 'conspiracy' to hide Biden's health decline (Image: AP)





WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday ordered an investigation into what Republicans claim was a ""conspiracy"" to cover up Joe Biden's declining cognitive health during his time in the White House.The move, which was slammed by Biden, is the latest in a long-running campaign by Trump -- with the backing of Republican Party politicians and their cheerleaders in the conservative media -- to discredit his predecessor.But it also comes as a growing chorus of Democrats begin to acknowledge the former president appeared to have been slipping in recent years.Those concerns were thrown into stark relief by a disastrous debate performance against Trump during last year's presidential campaign, in which the then-81-year-old stumbled over his words and repeatedly lost his train of thought.""In recent months, it has become increasingly apparent that former President Biden's aides abused the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline,"" a presidential memorandum issued Wednesday reads.""This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history.""The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden's signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.""- 'Ridiculous and false' -Biden vehemently denied the allegations.""Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations,"" he said in a statement shared with AFP.""Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false,"" he said, slamming the ordered probe as ""nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans who are working to push disastrous legislation.""Republicans have long claimed that Biden was suffering from intellectual decline even as the White House pressed ahead with major legislation and presidential decrees during his term.They cite his infrequent public appearances, as well as his apparent unwillingness to sit for interviews as evidence of what they say was a man incapable of doing the demanding job of Commander-in-Chief of the United States.They insist that those around him covered up his physical and cognitive decline, taking decisions on his behalf and using a device that could reproduce his signature to allow them to continue to run the country in his name.- 'Autopen' -""The Counsel to the President, in consultation with the Attorney General and the head of any other relevant executive department or agency... shall investigate... whether certain individuals conspired to deceive the public about Biden's mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the President,"" the document says.The probe will also look at ""the circumstances surrounding Biden's supposed execution of numerous executive actions during his final years in office (including) the policy documents for which the autopen was used (and) who directed that the President's signature be affixed.""Biden's calamitous debate performance ultimately sank his bid for re-election, with key Democratic Party figures soon calling for him to drop out of the race.But it was only several weeks later, after unsuccessful attempts to quieten his critics, that he withdrew, anointing his vice-president Kamala Harris, who eventually lost to Trump.The Democratic Party is increasingly riven by squabbles about whether Biden could have been forced to step down earlier to give the party chance to find a more popular presidential candidate.The fight has been given oxygen with the publication of a book by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson that claims the former president's inner circle connived to keep him from public view because of his decline, which included forgetting familiar faces like Hollywood star and party stalwart George Clooney.Trump's claims of a cover-up were also boosted by news that Biden is suffering from an ""aggressive"" prostate cancer, with some voices on the right insisting -- without evidence -- the diagnosis must have been known some time ago to those close to the former president.","US President Donald Trump orders inquiry into 'conspiracy' to hide Joe Biden's health decline.

What prompted Trump's travel ban?



What is a travel ban?



What is a presidential proclamation?



Ban go into effect from Monday



Is a rollback on the table?



Countries under full restriction



(As per statements released by White House)

Afghanistan - ""The Taliban, a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) group, controls Afghanistan. Afghanistan lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.""

Myanmar ( Burma ) - ""According to the Overstay Report , Burma had a B‑1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 27.07 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 42.17 percent. Additionally, Burma has historically not cooperated with the United States to accept back their removable nationals.""

Chad - ""According to the Overstay Report, Chad had a B‑1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 49.54 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 55.64 percent. According to the Fiscal Year 2022 Overstay Report, Chad had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 37.12 percent. The high visa overstay rate for 2022 and 2023 is unacceptable and indicates a blatant disregard for United States immigration laws.""

Republic of the Congo - ""According to the Overstay Report, the Republic of the Congo had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 29.63 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 35.14 percent.""

Equatorial Guinea - Recorded a 21.98% overstay rate for B1/B2 visas and 70.18% for student/exchange visas.

Eritrea - ""The United States questions the competence of the central authority for issuance of passports or civil documents in Eritrea. Criminal records are not available to the United States for Eritrean nationals.""

Haiti - ""Hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden Administration. This influx harms American communities by creating acute risks of increased overstay rates, establishment of criminal networks, and other national security threats.""

Iran - ""Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism . Iran regularly fails to cooperate with the United States Government in identifying security risks, is the source of significant terrorism around the world, and has historically failed to accept back its removable nationals.""

Libya - ""There is no competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents in Libya. The historical terrorist presence within Libya’s territory amplifies the risks posed by the entry into the United States of its nationals.""

Somalia - "" Somalia lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.""

Sudan - ""Sudan lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.""

Yemen - ""Yemen lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.""

Countries under partial restriction



Burundi

Cuba

Laos

Sierra Leone

Togo

Turkmenistan

Venezuela

Why were these countries chosen?



Lack of document integrity & vetting systems: Nations like Afghanistan, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Libya, and Venezuela are cited for lacking competent or cooperative authorities to issue credible documents or vet travellers.

High visa overstay rates: Burma, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Burundi, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, and Turkmenistan were flagged for significantly high rates of visa overstays in the US.

Terrorist threats and state-sponsored terrorism: Countries such as Iran, Afghanistan, Somalia, Libya, Cuba, and others were included due to their ties to terrorism or designation as state sponsors of terrorism.





Exemptions for Olympics, World Cups







Six months into his presidency, US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a far-reaching travel ban, saying, ""we don't want them."" This travel ban, impacting a total of 19 countries, can majorly reshape immigration policy of the United States.It was put forth through a presidential proclamation, the proposed restrictions introduce a three-tiered system of escalating barriers targeting nationals from more than a dozen countries.The measure is among the most aggressive in modern US history regarding global mobility. It has the potential to impact millions of people seeking entry to the United States for purposes including work, study, tourism, and relocation.Trump's latest decision on travel ban came days after Egyptian national was arrested for attacking a Jewish protest in Colorado's Boulder.In a video message, he said the Boulder incident revealed the dangers posed by unvetted foreign nationals and visa overstayers. ""The recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado has underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted,"" Trump said.""We don't want them.""A travel ban is a government-imposed restriction that prohibits or limits entry to the United States for citizens of specific countries. These restrictions may include total visa suspensions or targeted limitations on certain visa categories.Trump’s first executive order directed the State Department to identify nations where vetting procedures are inadequate, potentially justifying a full or partial suspension of entry for their nationals.The current proclamation builds on that order and cites a recent attack by an Egyptian national in Colorado's Boulder as additional justification.A presidential proclamation is a formal announcement by the President. While some proclamations are ceremonial, others --especially during national emergencies, can carry legal and policy weight.Unlike executive orders that direct federal agencies, proclamations often signal sweeping policy shifts.In this case, the White House said, “The Proclamation fully restricts and limits the entry of nationals from 12 countries found to be deficient with regard to screening and vetting and determined to pose a very high risk to the United States.”As per the White House's statement travel ban announced by Trump administration will go into effect from Monday.Trump added the latest travel ban was shaped by “foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism goals.”He said the list of restricted countries could change, adding it was “subject to revisions based on whether material improvements are made,” and “new countries could be added as threats emerge around the world.”On the campaign trail last year, Trump had pledged, “I will ban refugee resettlement from terror-infested areas like the Gaza Strip… Remember the famous travel ban?... We’re not taking them from infested countries.”The proclamation also imposes partial restrictions on citizens from seven additional countries identified as posing elevated risks:The proclamation outlines various justifications for including these countries:The travel ban will not apply to athletes participating in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico, or the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, according to Trump’s order.","US President Donald Trump announced a far-reaching travel ban on Wednesday.

What we know about Soliman's family







A Biden administration-appointed federal judge in Colorado has halted the deportation of the Boulder firebombing incident suspect's family members, including his five children.Mohamed Soliman, an Egyptian national who stayed illegally in the US even after his visa expired, was arrested on Sunday for firebombing a Jewish gathering in Colorado.US District Judge Gordon P Gallagher issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) that prevents immigration authorities from removing Soliman's wife, Hayem El Gamal, and their children from Colorado or the United States, Fox News reported.""Defendants are temporarily restrained and enjoined from removing Hayem El Gamal and her five minor children from the State of Colorado or the United States,"" stated Gallagher's order, which remains effective until June 13.The ruling followed an emergency request from El Gamal's friend, Susanna Dvortsin, who sought legal protection for the family. Dvortsin contended that the family faced immediate deportation without proper legal proceedings. Judge Gallagher concurred, noting potential ""irreparable harm"" from deportation.A hearing is scheduled for June 13 at Denver's Byron G. Rogers Courthouse.Sources informed Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin that while El Gamal and her children have exceeded their visa duration, Soliman had previously filed an asylum application for them.Soliman's daughter graduated from Thomas Maclaren State Charter School in Colorado Springs. According to reports, she came to the US with her father two years ago and is also probably an illegal alien. Trump-aide Laura Loomer said that a Colorado newspaper did a profile piece on his daughter, Habiba Soliman, for attending the school in hijab.According to the article, she described in her scholarship application how her family had immigrated to the US after living in Kuwait, noting that her father had undergone a “difficult surgery” when she was young “that restored his ability to walk.” The girl said the incident inspired her to pursue medical school – a dream that would have been impossible in Kuwait but within reach in America.During the investigation, Soliman revealed that he wanted to kill all Zionists and would do again. He planned the attack on the Jewish group that assembled every Sunday demanding the release of the Israelis in Gaza, but waited for her daughter's graduation.Police said after Soliman's arrest, his family members cooperated with the investigation. They were not privy to Soliman's plan.","Mohamed Soliman, an Egyptian national who stayed illegally in the US even after his visa expired, was arrested on Sunday for firebombing a Jewish gathering in Colorado.

The US administration led by President Donald Trump has intensified its conflict with Columbia University, stating that the institution fails to meet accreditation criteria due to inadequate protection of Jewish students.""After Hamas' October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel, Columbia University's leadership acted with deliberate indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students on its campus,"" stated US Secretary of Education Linda McMahon on Wednesday.The Office for Civil Rights at the US Department of Education announced Wednesday that it had informed the Middle States Commission on Higher Education about Columbia University's alleged Title VI Civil Rights Act violation, as per an Education Department release. ""The US Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today notified Middle States Commission on Higher Education (the Commission) that its member institution, Columbia University, is in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws and therefore fails to meet the standards for accreditation set by the Commission,"" stated the release.The federal body claimed that the university appears to no longer satisfy the commission's accreditation requirements.The comes as the US government escalates its scrutiny of elite academic institutions regarding allegations of widespread antisemitism and progressive prejudice.According to Columbia's website, accreditation, administered by non-profit organisations, is essential for university students to access federal funding, including grants and loans. ""We look forward to the Commission keeping the Department fully informed of actions taken to ensure Columbia's compliance with accreditation standards including compliance with federal civil rights laws,"" McMahon added to her statement.The Middle States Commission on Higher Education acknowledged, to CNN, the receipt of Wednesday's letter.Columbia faced accusations last month of breaching federal civil rights law through ""deliberate indifference"" to Jewish student harassment since October 7, 2023, corresponding with Hamas's attack and Israel's subsequent military response in Gaza.A Columbia representative characterised these findings as progression in their collaborative efforts with the government to address antisemitism on campus.This forms part of the federal government's Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism initiatives, established following Trump's February executive order.Trump further addressed college accreditation through an April executive order, directing the education secretary to ensure accreditors' accountability through various measures for poor performance or Civil Rights Act violations, as detailed by a White House official to CNN.The Education Department confirmed Wednesday its responsibility to inform accreditors about member institutions' non-compliance findings, in accordance with Trump's executive order.Leading US universities, including Columbia, face substantial pressure from the administration to implement policy changes or risk losing federal support.In March, Columbia implemented comprehensive policy changes after the administration threatened to withdraw $400 million in grants and contracts over alleged insufficient action against campus antisemitism.","US Department of Education says Columbia University fails to meet accreditation criteria due to inadequate protection of Jewish students.

Joto'





The husband of murdered King of the Hill actor Jonathan Joss says the man who shot him stood over the dying star, laughed, and delivered a slur.Joss, 59, was gunned down Sunday night near his home in San Antonio, Texas, in what his spouse, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, believes was a hate-motivated attack by a homophobic neighbor after years of harassment.“Everything was really close range. It was in the head,” Kern de Gonzales told The Independent. “I held his face together while I told him how much I loved him. He could still hear me… I could tell he was trying to say, ‘I love you.’”Kern de Gonzales claimed that the killers words while Joss was dying included homophobic slur. During the confrontation, he recounted the assailant's threatening behaviour while holding him at gunpoint. The attacker mockingly said, ""'Oh, you love him? Joto,'"" as per Kern de Gonzales's account. He further clarified, ""'is Spanish for f****t. I never knew the word until I came to Texas, and then I heard it a lot.""The accused shooter, identified as 52-year-old Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez, was arrested near the scene and has been charged with first-degree murder. According to the San Antonio Police Department (SAPD), Ceja admitted to the shooting, stating simply, “I shot him.”However, in a statement released Monday, SAPD said investigators had found “no evidence to indicate that… Mr.Joss' murder was related to his sexual orientation.” “We take such allegations very seriously and have thoroughly reviewed all available information,” the department added. “Should any new evidence come to light, we will charge the suspect accordingly.”Read more: Jonathan Joss was not murdered because he was gay, says San Antonio police, refuting husband's claim Additionally, SAPD records claim officers responded to more than 40 calls involving Joss in 2024, ranging from welfare checks to mental health concerns and neighbor disputes. Still, Kern de Gonzales insists his husband was not violent- only outspoken.Kern de Gonzales, identifying as transgender man, strongly disputed the department’s stance. He alleged the couple had endured years of targeted hostility from Ceja, and says their repeated complaints were ignored by law enforcement. “They ignored us, refused to file police reports for about two years [over the couple’s complaints of harassment], and now they're trying to say it wasn't a hate crime,” he told The Independent. “It's like when the police investigate themselves and find they did nothing wrong.”He also pointed to earlier, deeply unsettling events involving the suspect- including discovering their deceased dog's skull near their mailbox following a house fire this past winter. That detail does not appear in the SAPD incident report.According to Kern de Gonzales, the fatal confrontation began after Joss shouted at Ceja. The couple had stepped outside to check the mail when the alleged gunman approached with a weapon. “I don’t care if me and my husband were walking around with one pitchfork in our hand and another pitchfork up our a**, we didn’t point any weapons at anybody,” he said. “When the man rolled up with the gun, we were checking the mail.”Joss, who was of Native American descent, was best known for voicing John Redcorn on the long-running animated series King of the Hill. Beyond his work in entertainment, his husband says he was deeply spiritual and often chanted or drummed in the yard- acts that, he alleges, drew racial abuse from some in the neighborhood. “I had never seen someone be accosted for being Native American,” said Kern de Gonzales. “People would drive by and yell out the window, ‘F***ing Indian. ’”He added that Joss also faced ridicule for his appearance. “Jonathan would be harassed for just being in his yard wearing a dress,” he said. “When people would ask why he wore a dress, he would say, ‘Because I have nice legs.’ And he did. He looked beautiful in a dress. And I think a lot of people were threatened by that, because Jonathan could wear a dress and still be masculine and confident.”","Jonathan Joss, 59, was gunned down Sunday night near his home in San Antonio, Texas.

Trump said, “I have determined that the entry of the class of foreign nationals described above is detrimental to the interests of the United States because, in my judgment, Harvard’s conduct has rendered it an unsuitable destination for foreign students and researchers,” Trump wrote in the order.The announcement follows months of tension between the Trump administration and Harvard, beginning with the university’s resistance to demands for internal records and governance changes.Homeland security had earlier claimed that Harvard failed to fully cooperate with a request for information on misconduct involving international students. Harvard said it responded, but the administration argued the data was insufficient.Trump’s order affects all foreign students seeking entry to Harvard after the order’s date, though it allows for exceptions if the student’s presence is considered to serve “national interest.” Existing students already in the US may also face visa revocations.The executive order is set to last six months, with a review scheduled within 90 days to assess whether it should be extended.","The executive order cites national security as the reason for the decision.

ANCHORAGE: The crew of a cargo ship carrying 3,000 vehicles to Mexico, including 800 electric vehicles, abandoned ship after they could not control a fire aboard the vessel in waters off Alaska's Aleutian island chain.A large plume of smoke was initially seen at the ship's stern coming from the deck loaded with electric vehicles Tuesday, according to US coast guard photos and a Wednesday statement from the ship's management company, London-based Zodiac Maritime.There were no reported injuries among the 22 crew members of the Morning Midas.Crew members abandoned ship, were evacuated onto a lifeboat and rescued by the crew of a nearby merchant vessel called the Cosco Hellas in the North Pacific, roughly 490 kilometers southwest of Adak Island. Adak is about 1,930 kilometers west of Anchorage, the state's largest city.The crew initiated emergency firefighting procedures with the ship's onboard fire suppression system. But they were unable bring the flames under control.""The relevant authorities have been notified, and we are working closely with emergency responders with a tug being deployed to support salvage and firefighting operations,"" Zodiac Maritime said in a statement.""Our priorities are to ensure the continued safety of the crew and protect the marine environment.""The US coast guard said it sent aircrews to Adak and a ship to the area. The status of the fire onboard the ship was unknown as of Wednesday afternoon, but smoke was still emanating from it, according to the coast guard.Rear Admiral Megan Dean, commander of the coast guard's seventeenth district, said in a statement that as the search and rescue part of the response concluded, the coast guard was working with Zodiac Maritime to determine how to recover the ship and what will be done with it.""We are grateful for the selfless actions of the three nearby vessels who assisted in the response and the crew of motor vessel Cosco Hellas, who helped save 22 lives,"" Dean said.The 183 metre Morning Midas, a car and truck carrier, was built in 2006 and sails under a Liberian flag.The cars left Yantai, China, on May 26, according to the industry site marinetraffic.com. They were being shipped to Lazaro Cardenas, a major Pacific port in Mexico.Earlier this month, a Dutch safety board called for improving emergency response on North Sea shipping routes after a deadly 2023 fire on a freighter that was carrying 3,000 automobiles, including nearly 500 electric vehicles, from Germany to Singapore.That fire killed one person, injured others and burned out of control for a week, and the ship was eventually towed to a port in the northern Netherlands for salvage.The accident increased the focus on safety issues on the open sea and on containers that fall off the massive freighters, which have increased in size dramatically in recent decades. More than 80% of international trade by volume now arrives by sea, and the largest container vessels are longer than three football fields.","The Morning Midas was carrying 3,000 vehicles to Mexico, including 800 electric vehicles.

‘Russia Will Respond To Ukraine Attack’: Trump Speaks To Putin For 75 Minutes Over Phone





US President Donald Trump revealed that he held a tense phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, discussing the recent Ukrainian strike on Russian airfields and growing concerns over Iran’s nuclear ambitions.In a post on social media platform X, Trump said the call with Putin lasted “approximately one hour and 15 minutes” and was “a good conversation,” though he admitted it would not “lead to immediate Peace.” The two leaders discussed “various other attacks that have been taking place by both sides.”According to Trump, Putin “very strongly” indicated that Russia would respond to Ukraine’s recent airfield attack. The Russian military has accused Kyiv of damaging several docked aircraft in an overnight drone strike on Russian soil, a claim Ukraine has neither confirmed nor denied.The call comes just days after Trump gave Putin a blunt two-week deadline to show concrete progress toward ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump warned that unless Russia proves it is serious about peace, “we’ll respond a little bit differently.”Earlier on Monday, Ukrainian and Russian delegations held a second round of peace talks in Istanbul, their second meeting in just over two weeks. However, Russia refused to agree to an unconditional ceasefire.The talks took place shortly after Ukraine carried out a surprise attack on four Russian airbases spread across the country.Discussing Iran’s nuclear weapon issue he told Putin, “I stated to President Putin that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.”He believed that the Russian leader also agreed over this.“President Putin suggested that he will participate in the discussions with Iran and that he could, perhaps, be helpful in getting this brought to a rapid conclusion,” he said.He further added that the country had been “slowwalking their decision on this very important matter,” and “we will need a definitive answer in a very short period of time!” he said.Meanwhile, earlier on Wednesday, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that the US proposal for the nuclear agreement was against the country’s national interest.The call came after the US President had earlier issued a stark ultimatum to Putin, giving him a two week deadline to prove his seriousness about ending the war and bringing peace in Ukraine. He also warned that Russia of resorting to a “different” approach had in case Putin had not been genuine about informing the US.","US President Donald Trump held a tense phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"Over 200,000 Afghans forced to leave Pakistan amid intensified deportation drive; Iran ramps up expulsions too",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/over-200000-afghans-forced-to-leave-pakistan-amid-intensified-deportation-drive-iran-ramps-up-expulsions-too/articleshow/121626249.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: ANI)





More than 200,000 Afghans have left Pakistan since April as Islamabad ramped up its deportation campaign targeting undocumented migrants, with Iran also increasing expulsions, raising concerns over Afghanistan’s capacity to manage the influx.According to Pakistan’s ministry of interior, over 135,000 Afghans left the country in April, followed by 67,000 in May, and more than 3,000 in just the first two days of June. The repatriation drive, which began in November 2023, has now seen over one million Afghans return from Pakistan, reported news agency ANI, citing ARY News.The deportation campaign is aimed at more than 800,000 Afghans whose residency documents have been revoked. Among them are individuals born or raised in Pakistan. Islamabad has accused Afghan nationals of links to terrorism and blamed Kabul for harbouring militants, a charge the Taliban authorities have repeatedly denied.Farmer Mohammad Wali, who crossed into Afghanistan via the southern Spin Boldak border, was quoted by AFP as saying, “We left behind our orchards... but we said to ourselves, ‘If we stay, maybe one day we’ll lose our dignity.’”With Eid al-Adha approaching, the pace of returns has slightly slowed, though crossings continue daily.Iran, meanwhile, is pushing ahead with similar measures. The UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) recorded 15,675 Afghan deportations from Iran in May, more than double the figure in April.The IOM expressed alarm at the increasing number of families, rather than single men, being sent back, calling this “a new and concerning trend.”In late May, Iranian authorities ordered undocumented Afghans to leave by July 6—a move that could impact as many as four million people, according to AFP. Already, more than 450,000 Afghans have returned from Iran since January.Both nations host millions of Afghan refugees who fled decades of conflict.But as economic conditions worsen and political tensions rise, public support for Afghan migrants has diminished. Pakistan, which still hosts around three million Afghans, has also warned it may revoke the UNHCR-issued refugee cards of 1.3 million cardholders by the end of June.The IOM has repeatedly urged countries to “immediately suspend the forced return of Afghans... until safe, voluntary, and dignified return conditions are in place.”The Taliban authorities, who remain internationally unrecognised, have echoed the call, asking for returns to occur in a “dignified” manner.Analysts view the deportation moves, particularly by Pakistan, as politically driven. Islamabad is under pressure to address domestic security threats, especially in border regions plagued by insurgencies.However, rights groups and humanitarian agencies warn that Afghanistan’s already fragile infrastructure is ill-equipped to absorb such a massive and sudden return of people.","More than 200,000 Afghans have left Pakistan since April as Islamabad ramped up its deportation campaign targeting undocumented migrants.

Baloch movement: Pak accused of extrajudicial killings; outifts seek probe into forced disappearances,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/baloch-movement-pak-accused-of-extrajudicial-killings-outifts-seek-probe-into-forced-disappearances/articleshow/121620898.cms,"



Baloch human rights group Paank strongly condemned the killing of two Baloch men whose bodies were found in Kalat, calling it another disturbing sign of growing violence and repression in the region.Samiullah, son of Muhammad Hanif, and Bismillah, son of Ghulam Sarwar, both residents of Padang Abad in Mastung district, were found dead on 3 June in the Ganda Gain neighbourhood of Sheikhri, Kalat. According to Levies officials, both men had been brutally shot, their bodies discarded and later transported to RHC Mangochar for formalities.Paank, in a post on X said, “Forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces on May 29, 2025, their executions are a glaring testament to the ongoing horrors of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings in Balochistan, a despicable violation of humanity that must be stopped.”The rights organisation said 2025 has already seen a surge in such cases. In February alone, Paank documented five extrajudicial executions and 33 enforced disappearances. Among the victims were Bashir Ahmad Marri and Arman Marri, who were reportedly executed in a staged encounter after being abducted in 2023.The group also referred to the tragic case of Rehana, who was shot dead in Awaran while trying to prevent her husband’s kidnapping.In April, Mehrab and Khan Mohammad were tortured to death in Kech after disappearing earlier in the month, while the tortured body of Sher Khan Nazar was discovered in Turbat two days after he went missing.Most recently, Zabid Ali, a resident of Chaghi, was abducted from his home on 11 May.In a separate post on X, Paank demanded the safety and recovery of three members of the family who “were forcibly disappeared in Pidarak area in Kech district.”On June 3, 2025, Pakistani security forces allegedly carried out a series of enforced disappearances in the Pidarak area of Kech district, Balochistan. Among those abducted from their homes were Sinkandar Baloch, son of Muhammad Anwar; Siddique Sabzal, son of Sabzal Baloch; and Ibrahim Yaqoob, son of Yaqoob Baloch. All three men were reportedly detained without any legal process, and their whereabouts remain unknown.Enforced disappearances remain one of Balochistan’s most alarming human rights crises. International watchdogs such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have repeatedly urged the Pakistani state to investigate these abuses and take meaningful steps to end the practice, which leaves families traumatised and communities in fear.","Samiullah and Bismillah were found dead on 3 June in the Ganda Gain neighbourhood of Sheikhri, Kalat.

'Vindictive nature': Imran Khan levels fiery charge at Asim Munir; alleges army chief targeted his wife,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/vindictive-nature-imran-khan-levels-fiery-charge-at-asim-munir-alleges-army-chief-targeted-his-wife/articleshow/121616395.cms,"Pakistan On Knees, Pleads India To Withdraw This Decision; ‘Reconsider Blocking…’ | Watch





NEW DELHI: Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has accused army chief general Asim Munir of waging a personal vendetta against his wife, Bushra Bibi.In a social media post on Monday, Khan claimed the alleged animosity dates back to his decision to remove Munir from his position as Director General of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) during Khan's tenure.In a social media post on Monday, Khan claimed that following Munir's dismissal, the general attempted to contact Bushra Bibi through intermediaries, but she refused, stating she ""had no involvement with such affairs."" Khan attributed his wife's 14-month imprisonment and alleged mistreatment to ""General Asim Munir's vindictive nature.""Khan further asserted that Bushra Bibi, a private citizen with no political role, has been falsely accused and arrested repeatedly without evidence. “The way my wife has been targeted for personal vengeance is unprecedented. Even during Pakistan’s darkest periods of dictatorship, such a thing never happened,” he said, noting he had not been allowed to meet her in four weeks, despite a scheduled June 1 meeting.Turning his criticism toward the military-backed government and judiciary, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief accused authorities of suppressing democratic dissent and rigging the political system.He blamed the events of May 9, 2023—when military installations were attacked—on a so-called “London Plan” aimed at dismantling PTI. “Our democratic mandate was brazenly stolen, and corrupt individuals — Sharifs and Zardaris — were imposed upon the nation,” he said.Khan alleged that anti-terrorism courts and judges are complicit in the crackdown on his party and deliberately ignoring key evidence. “Despite repeated demands, they refuse to summon or examine the stolen CCTV footage from May 9, 2023… We are innocent. Our people are being sentenced without evidence and without the right to a fair trial.”Calling for a judicial commission, Khan demanded investigations into the deaths of unarmed pro-democracy protesters on May 9 and November 26, 2024. He also lashed out at the judiciary, comparing current Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa to the widely criticised Justice Munir, saying the institution is “driven not by justice but by a desire to protect their own jobs and privileges.”Khan’s remarks come days after a court sentenced 11 PTI supporters, including a lawmaker, for violence and vandalism on May 9 last year—an incident triggered by his arrest.The 72-year-old PTI founder has been in Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi since mid-2023, facing multiple legal cases.","Imran Khan has accused army chief general Asim Munir of waging a personal vendetta against his wife, Bushra Bibi.
