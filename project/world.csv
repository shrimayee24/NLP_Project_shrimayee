He added, govt is currently investigating 11 prominent individuals and companies, including former PM Hasina and her family members.A meeting was held with the 11-member task force, which was established in Sept last year. According to Alam, the task force has already engaged with around 200 law firms and may enter agreements with about 30 internationally known firms to expedite the recovery process.Muhammad Yunus’ special assistant M Aminul Islam resigned from his position on Monday, reportedly after being “asked to do so” by the chief adviser’s office. Aminul was tasked with assisting the education adviser.

NAGPUR: A 30-year-old chef of a five-star hotel in Nagpur was arrested Monday for flashing in the presence of women on a footpath on Wardha Road. The incident, on Sunday evening, triggered commotion on the busy stretch, where citizens usually gather for a stroll or chat. The pervert’s video, shot by a college student, went viral on social media sparking outrage and forcing cops to swiftly arrest the chef, who worked as a kitchen supervisor in the top hotel chain.The accused, Shantkumar, would often film his vulgar act on phone. During investigation, police were shocked to find his phone gallery replete with explicit videos , including many shot within his house. The chef, living in Nagpur for six months, admitted to filming himself in sexual acts with other women, police said. There were other pornographic videos, too, in his phone gallery.On Sunday evening, he stepped out of his car, walked towards the women while talking on his phone, and began masturbating. While most turned away, a college student decided to teach the pervert a lesson. She took out her phone and recorded his misdeeds, along with the red car in which he arrived. It was the car’s registration number plate that helped police track him down. The student said the accused was not perturbed when she began filming him in the act.","A 30-year-old chef of a five-star hotel in Nagpur was arrested Monday for flashing in the presence of women on a footpath.

AMRITSAR: The coronation of Giani Kuldeep Singh Gargaj as jathedar of Takht Kesgarh Sahib and as officiating jathedar of Akal Takht early Monday was marked by the absence of traditional grandeur, religious rituals , and participation from high-ranking community members.No senior officials from SGPC and SAD, typically present on such occasions, attended the ceremony at Takht Kesgarh Sahib, held quietly at 2.30am.The function at Akal Takht took place discreetly later in the evening.Heads or representatives of Sikh organisations such as jathedars of other Takhts, Nihang organisations, Sikh Sewa Societies, and Singh Sabhas didn’t attend the ceremonies.Former Akal Takht jathedar Bhai Ranjit Singh expressed his disappointment over the lack of religious rituals, highlighting that the installation of a jathedar is an occasion akin to a Gurpurb and should have been marked with greater respect and celebration.“To what extent Giani Kuldeep will be able to hold authority within the Panth,” he questioned.Panthic Talmel Sangathan, a conglomerate of around 150 Sikh bodies, announced to stage protests in front of homes of executive committee members of SGPC who signed the decision to relieve the two jathedars.However, Sikh intellectual Harjit Singh believes that almost every organisation has always been divided into two or more factions, and the same situation is unfolding here.“Those who are opposing were appointed through the same procedure by SGPC, which was then supported by Shiromani Akali Dal. Now, after being dismissed on various charges, they are raising a hue and cry,” Sikh intellectual Harjit Singh explained.","No senior officials from SGPC and SAD, typically present on such occasions, attended the ceremony at Takht Kesgarh Sahib.

‘Living conditions at Myawaddy decent, terrible near border’

A C-17 Indian military plane Monday evacuated 266 men and 17 women stuck at the Thai-Myanmar border for weeks after being rescued from scam call centres in Myanmar’s Myawaddy. A second batch of 240 are expected to be repatriated Tuesday.The evacuees belong to multiple states, including Andhra, Telangana, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab, UP and Bengal. It was not immediately known where the plane landed in India. K Madhukar Reddy, a native of Rangapeta in Telangana’s Karimnagar district, said over the phone Indian embassy officials and Myanmar’s Border Guard Force facilitated the evacuation.According to an AFP report, a group of Indian officials crossed into Myanmar to accompany seven buses taking the freed Indian nationals — as well as three more carrying their luggage — to Mae Sot airport in northwest Thailand. Authorities in Myanmar, under pressure from ally China, have cracked down in recent weeks on illegal online fraud operations that have flourished in the country’s lawless borderlands. Around 7,000 workers from at least two dozen countries have been freed, the majority of them Chinese, but many have been languishing in squalid conditions in temporary holding camps on the Thai-Myanmar border.“We just want to get out of these detention centres and return home,” one of them told TOI.An Indian currently in detention described the conditions. “The accommodation is decent at Myawaddy detention. They have provided well-maintained AC rooms, but the food is inadequate — sometimes we get one meal a day.”He said conditions were much worse at the border. “There are over 500 people there, with no proper toilets or food. They are forced to stay in army camp-like tents. When we arrived, they took away everyone’s mobile phones.”The rescue operation followed a crackdown on fraudulent cybercrime syndicates that lure foreign workers, including Indians, with fake job offers. These networks, often linked to Chinese-run scam operations, operate from compounds such as KK Park in Myanmar, where victims are forced to carry out phishing schemes, investment frauds, and romance scams.In Feb, Myanmar’s military and BGF raided KK Park and freed about 70 Indians, including five women. Those were later moved to the Thai border, awaiting repatriation.Authorities say many victims were recruited through social media and fake employment agencies, particularly targeting those with IT skills. These scams, often operating in Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar, promise lucrative salaries and attractive benefits. Once the recruits arrive, their passports are confiscated, and they are held in heavily guarded compounds, coerced into running online scams under the threat of violence.","A C-17 Indian military plane Monday evacuated 266 men and 17 women stuck at the Thai-Myanmar border for weeks.

Former TV star Wendy Williams , who was diagnosed with dementia and stays at a New York assisted living facility, was taken away by an ambulance Monday after the cops were called following Williams' plea for help from the window of her room. According to reports, she tossed a handwritten note out of the window begging for help. ""Help! Wendy!"" the note said. After the police arrived, Williams walked to the ambulance on her own as a handful of police escorted her out of her room.Wendy Williams has been fighting her court-ordered guardianship and is under a conservatory similar to the one Britney Spears lived under.

I can call you, but you can’t call me,"" she said during a recent interview with TMZ.""This system has failed from top to bottom regarding this guardianship and everybody involved with that. The system failed. I want my freedom back.""Williams says she had a falling out with her son, who allegedly exploited her for financial gain.""My son, he overstepped his boundaries in terms of me.

In an interview last month, Wendy Williams said she lives on a floor that is called the ""memory unit"" as the people who live there don't remember anything. She, however, said she does not have dementia.Earlier this year, Williams fitted her court-appointed attorney and said she regained the capacity to function on her own without her legal guardian Sabrina Morrissey. In November, Sabrina claimed in the court that Williams was permanently incapacitated by the early onset of dementia.","Wendy Williams was taken away by an ambulance Monday after the cops were called following Williams' plea for help from the window of her room.

Police arrested former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte at Manila's international airport on Tuesday following directives from the International Criminal Court regarding a case of crime against humanity, according to Philippine government officials.Upon his return from Hong Kong, law enforcement took Duterte into custody based on ICC orders. The elderly former leader is charged with ""the crime against humanity"" by the ICC, following a campaign where human rights organisations estimate that law enforcement and vigilante groups killed tens of thousands of underprivileged men, frequently without evidence for their involvement in narcotics.""Early in the morning, Interpol Manila received the official copy of the warrant of the arrest from the ICC,"" stated the presidential office in an announcement. ""As of now, he is under the custody of authorities."" The announcement further indicated that ""the former president and his group are in good health and are being checked by government doctors"".The ICC initiated its probe into drug-related deaths under Duterte's tenure spanning from November 1, 2011, as mayor of Davao, through March 16, 2019, examining potential crimes against humanity. In 2019, Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the Rome Statute, an action rights advocates view as an attempt to avoid responsibility for the killings.In late 2021, Duterte's government attempted to halt the international court's investigation, contending that Philippine authorities were already examining identical allegations and disputing the ICC's jurisdiction as a court of final resort.ICC appeals judges authorised the investigation's continuation in July 2023, dismissing the Duterte administration's challenges. The ICC, situated in The Hague, Netherlands, intervenes when nations are unable or unwilling to prosecute individuals suspected of severe international offences, including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.While President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. , who followed Duterte in 2022 and later entered a fierce political conflict with him, opted against rejoining the international court, his administration indicated it would assist if the ICC requests international police assistance through a Red Notice to detain Duterte, which enables worldwide law enforcement to locate and temporarily arrest suspects.","Police arrested former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte at Manila's international airport on Tuesday following directives from the International Criminal Court.

US added to global watchlist over 'significant deterioration' in civic conditions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-added-to-global-watchlist-over-significant-deterioration-in-civic-conditions/articleshow/118868488.cms,"Image used for representative purposes

The United States has been added to the Civicus Monitor Watchlist , alleging decline in civic freedom under Trump administration. Civicus, a global civil rights watchdog that tracks civic freedoms across 198 countries, released its first watchlist of 2025 on Monday, citing 'significant deterioration' of civil liberties in the US.The US inclusion stems from what Civicus describes as systematic challenges to democratic principles and international cooperation under the Trump administration, reported the Guardian. The organisation cited specific actions, including widespread federal employee dismissals, strategic appointments of Trump supporters, withdrawal from international bodies, aid freezing, and attempts to dismantle USAID.The organisation expressed particular concern about restrictions on pro-Palestinian demonstrations and unprecedented control over media access to presidential briefings.Alongside the US, the latest list includes the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Italy, Pakistan, and Serbia. Previously, it listed nations such as Zimbabwe, Argentina, El Salvador and the United Arab Emirates. According to Mandeep Tiwana, co-secretary general of Civicus, the watchlist evaluates nations where civic space conditions are deteriorating, particularly regarding freedoms of peaceful assembly, association and expression. “Restrictive executive orders, unjustifiable institutional cutbacks, and intimidation tactics through threatening pronouncements by senior officials in the administration are creating an atmosphere to chill democratic dissent, a cherished American ideal,” Tiwana said in a statment justifying the decision.Civicus characterised the behaviour of Trump after assuming presidency as an ""unparalleled attack on the rule of law"" unseen ""since the days of McCarthyism in the twentieth century"". The organisation further stated that such presidential actions undermine the fundamental democratic principle of checks and balances.Apart from the recent addition to watchlist, the US currently holds a ""narrowed"" rating on the Civicus Monitor's five-tier classification system (open, narrowed, obstructed, repressed and closed). Under Trump's previous term, the rating had declined to ""obstructed"" following responses to Black Lives Matter protests and restrictive environmental protest legislation. Though it improved under Biden's leadership, being back to ""narrowed"", Civicus now suggests the country may return to ""obstructed"" status.Tiwana claimed that while the US traditionally championed democracy and fundamental freedoms in its foreign policy, recent administrative actions risk emboldening authoritarian regimes globally.","Civicus, a global civil rights watchdog that tracks civic freedoms across 198 countries, released its first watchlist of 2025 on Monday.

A heated exchange unfolded when billionaire and head of department of government efficiency (DOGE) Elon Musk labelled Senator Mark Kelly , D-Ariz, a ""traitor"" following Kelly's Ukraine visit and his subsequent support for continued US assistance in the Russia-Ukraine conflict .Kelly, whose background includes service as a Nasa astronaut and Navy combat pilot during Operation Desert Storm, toured Ukraine during the weekend. After meeting Ukrainian military personnel and medical staff, he expressed on social media that his observations reinforced the necessity to ""can't give up on the Ukrainian people."" ""Just left Ukraine. What I saw proved to me we can’t give up on the Ukrainian people. Everyone wants this war to end, but any agreement has to protect Ukraine’s security and can’t be a giveaway to Putin,"" said Kelly along with a series of post about his visit and ""why it’s important we stand with Ukraine.""In response to the post, Musk gave a short reply saying, ""You are a traitor"".Later, Kelly hit back at the owner of X saying, ""Traitor?

He also criticised Kelly, his twin brother Scott Kelly, and Danish astronaut Andreas Mogensen, calling Mark Kelly a ""Dem donor shill"".Kelly's response was direct at the time sayin, ""Hey @ElonMusk, when you finally get the nerve to climb into a rocket ship, come talk to the three of us.""","Elon Musk clashes with Democrat senator Mark Kelly over Ukraine support.

Who Is Mahmoud Khalil: Can Green Card be revoked?

What did the university say?



Who is Mahmoud Khalil?



ICE agents have recently arrested Mahmoud Khalil , a Palestinian activist, who completed his graduate studies at Columbia University in December. On Saturday night when ICE agents arrested him, the Columbia University Apartheid Divest leader was inside his university-owned apartment, a few blocks away from the college. Khalil was arrested for leading disruptive protests on the campus last year.""We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio commented sharing an article about Khalil's arrest triggering questions about whether people with green cards and visas will also be deported by the Donald Trump administration.Attorney Amy Greer said Khalil was told that he was being arrested after his student visa had been revoked but she pointed out that Khalil is a permanent resident of the US. Greer told the arresting officers about Khalil's legal status but Khalil was detained anyway.Columbia put out a statement stressing that it won't cooperate with ICE's actions except where required by law. “Consistent with our longstanding practice and the practice of cities and institutions throughout the country, law enforcement must have a judicial warrant to enter non-public university areas, including university buildings,” the statement read in part. “Columbia is committed to complying with all legal obligations and supporting our student body and campus community.”A petition demanding Khalil’s immediate release posted on Action Network garnered more than 349,000 signatures by Sunday evening.An ICE agent reportedly told Khalil’s lawyer Greer that the agency was enforcing a State Department edict to revoke Khalil’s student visa as well as his green card , pursuant to Trump’s recent pledge to deport foreign student “agitators” responsible for fomenting campus unrest.A Palestinian-American, Mahmoud Khalil was reportedly raised in a refugee camp in Syria. Before studying in Columbia, he worked for the British Embassy in Beirut. His lawyer said he is a Green Card holder and did not come to the US on a student visa. According to reports, Khalil is married, and his US-citizen wife is eight months pregnant. The couple lived in the university-owned apartment, which was raided by ICE.","Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian-American, was reportedly raised in a refugee camp in Syria.

Sudiksha Konanki missing: Indian-origin student feared drowned after late-night swim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sudiksha-konanki-missing-indian-origin-student-feared-drowned-after-late-night-swim/articleshow/118843075.cms,"A night on the beach turns into a nightmare

Lingering doubts and a desperate search

Father’s plea: 'This doesn’t add up'

A mystery without closure

The search for Sudiksha Konanki , a 20-year-old University of Pittsburgh student who vanished in the Dominican Republic last week, has taken a tragic turn. Authorities now suspect she was swept away by a powerful wave while swimming off a Punta Cana beach in the early hours of Thursday morning, according to reports by New York Post. But questions remain—was it truly an accident, or is there more to the story?Konanki, a bright pre-med student and legal US resident, had traveled with five friends from Pitt for what was supposed to be a carefree spring break in the Caribbean. On Wednesday night, she and six others strolled along the beach at the Riu República Hotel . By the time the night wound down, most of the group had left—except for Konanki and one other person, reported ABC News.Surveillance footage captured her at 4:15 am, still on the sand with a young man whose identity has not been publicly disclosed. What happened next remains a matter of investigation, but according to a police report obtained by ABC News, the two decided to take a swim, only to be caught by a massive wave.Authorities now believe Konanki drowned. Yet, with no body recovered and no definitive evidence, her family refuses to accept this as the final answer.Rescue teams launched an all-out effort to find her, deploying helicopters, drones, and boats to scour the turquoise waters of Bávaro Beach. On land, investigators combed the white sands for any sign of the missing student.The young man last seen with her was questioned by authorities, though officials have not clarified whether he is also a Pitt student. His account aligns with the drowning theory, but Konanki’s family remains unconvinced.Sudiksha’s father, Subbarayudu Konanki, has been vocal in his doubts. He traveled to the Dominican Republic, pleading with authorities to expand the investigation beyond the water.“They’re only searching the ocean, but what if she was taken? What if this wasn’t an accident?” he said. “We don’t think she could survive this long in the water, but that doesn’t mean she drowned. We need answers.”A spokesperson for the sheriff’s office in Loudoun County, Virginia, where Konanki lived, echoed similar skepticism. “The idea of her drowning is based on her last known location near the beach, but there’s no hard evidence to support that conclusion at this time.”Konanki was last seen wearing a brown bikini, bracelets on both arms, and an anklet. Authorities say there’s still no trace of her.With pressure mounting from both US and Indian officials, investigators are facing scrutiny over whether they reached a conclusion too soon. Until evidence emerges to confirm what truly happened to Sudiksha Konanki, the mystery of her disappearance continues to haunt her family, friends, and the quiet shores of Punta Cana.","Sudiksha Konanki, a 20-year-old University of Pittsburgh student, vanished in the Dominican Republic last week.

'Hope we'll be in a different place very soon': State secretary Marco Rubio signals possible resumption of US aid to Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hope-well-be-in-a-different-place-very-soon-state-secretary-marco-rubio-signals-possible-resumption-of-us-aid-to-ukraine/articleshow/118865978.cms,"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks with the media on his military airplane as he flies to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has indicated that US aid and intelligence support to Ukraine might resume if Ukrainian leadership demonstrates 'commitment to peace negotiations'.The US administration seeks to understand potential compromises Ukraine might consider during peace negotiations to conclude the conflict with Russia, according to Rubio. “We really want to sort of ascertain where they stand on this and what they’re willing to do in order to achieve peace,” he told reporters while heading to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia for a key meet with Ukraine delegation.""My hope is we'll have a really good meeting tomorrow and be in a different place very soon,"" the secretary of state added, claiming that Tuesday’s meeting “will be key” to decision on resuming military aid and intelligence sharing. “I think if we emerge there with a good meeting that we feel good about and can report back to the president, then I think decisions will be made in regards to the pause,” he further said.With regards of sharing intelligence, CNN reported that while the US continues sharing defensive intelligence with Ukraine, it has reduced sharing intelligence that could be used for offensive operations against Russian forces, according to two US defence officials.The top US diplomat indicated that Rubio and Waltz will attend meetings with Ukraine's national security adviser, foreign minister and defence minister in an observational capacity.Rubio acknowledged the Ukrainian people's significant hardships and noted that whilst discussing concessions is challenging after such suffering, it remains the sole path to preventing further casualties. He emphasised that he would not impose conditions on Ukraine's decisions. The senior US diplomat noted that Ukraine's potential concessions might not align with Russia's expectations. ""That's what we need to find out. We're not going to find out on X. We're not going to find out, you know, on media, press conferences. We have to find out in rooms that are closed,"" Rubio stated.Rubio explained that whilst the discussions would not involve specific territorial negotiations, the US aims to understand potential Ukrainian concessions, their requirements, and Russia's position on these matters to assess the extent of disagreement between the parties.This comes after the US administration halted all assistance and intelligence support to Ukraine following a contentious White House exchange between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US President Donald Trump and Vice-President JD Vance.The confrontation involved direct exchanges where Trump and Vance emphasised repeatedly the significance of American support to Ukraine whilst demanding acknowledgment and appreciation. Former President Joe Biden had previously expressed similar concerns to Zelenskyy during a stern telephone discussion in 2022, shortly after the invasion and subsequent US support. Zelenskyy promptly expressed public appreciation for American assistance within hours.His response to the current administration took several days. He posted a message describing the situation as ""regrettable"" on X, shortly before Trump's inaugural second-term address to Congress.""None of us wants an endless war,"" Zelensky wrote. ""Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians. My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts.""","US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has indicated that US aid and intelligence support to Ukraine might resume if Ukrainian leadership demonstrates 'commitment to peace negotiations' The US administration seeks to understand potential compromises Ukraine might consider during peace negotiations to conclude the conflict with Russia.

The US Senate confirmed Lori Chavez-DeRemer as the labour secretary in Trump administration on Monday. In this role, she will enforce federally mandated worker protections whilst the White House aims to reduce government staff numbers.She will lead the Department of Labour, which is involved in legal challenges regarding Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency's authority over redundancies and data access.The Labour Department, with nearly 16,000 full-time staff and a proposed budget of $13.9 billion for fiscal year 2025, has extensive duties. These include publishing unemployment figures, workplace safety regulation, investigating wage disputes, and enforcing laws on union organisation.Major labour unions, including the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, supported Chavez-DeRemer's nomination. A former Republican congresswoman from Oregon and a Teamster's daughter, she developed a pro-labour reputation during her House term.The Senate approved her nomination 67-32, making her among the last of Trump's Cabinet confirmations.The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labour & Pensions voted 14-9 for her nomination. All Republicans except Sen. Rand Paul supported her, alongside three Democrats: Sens. John Hickenlooper, Tim Kaine and Maggie Hassan.During committee hearings, Republican senators questioned her about co-sponsoring legislation supporting worker unionisation and penalising resistant employers. She avoided directly addressing her stance on the Protecting the Right to Organize Act ( PRO Act ), explaining her co-sponsorship as a means to participate in labour discussions. She later affirmed support for state ""right to work"" laws.Chavez-DeRemer also supported legislation protecting public-sector workers' Social Security benefits from pension-related reductions. Regarding minimum wage, she acknowledged its stagnation at $7.25 since 2009 but expressed concerns about economic impact.Democratic senators have raised concerns about her independence under President Trump's administration, which has terminated numerous federal employees.","Lori Chavez-DeRemer is a former Republican congresswoman from Oregon.

It’s a crime to enter this country illegally, and we’re gonna enforce those laws,"" Tom Homan said in an interview on Fox News.These remarks came after the Democratic representative appeared on 'The Katie Phang Show' on MSNBC to discuss her role in a House Committee hearing on sanctuary city policies last week, where she told the viewers that illegally entering the United States is not a ""crime"" but rather a ""civil violation,"" arguing that undocumented immigrants should not be classified as criminals.""[Republicans] are so outraged by these immigrants and the crime that they’re bringing.

ISLAMABAD: Unidentified gunmen shot dead three migrant barbers inside their shop in Panjgur district of Pakistan’s volatile southwestern Baluchistan province, police said on Monday.Baluchistan has in recent years witnessed a sharp increase in targeted killings of non-Baluch inhabitants, including barbers, commuters, and workers from other provinces, particularly Punjab. Ethnic Baluch separatist militants accuse non-Baluch residents of spying for the Pakistani military, against which they have waged an insurgency.The victims of the latest incident hailed from Mirpurkhas and Jacobabad districts in southern Sindh province“Three Sindhi barbers lost their lives in a targeted attack in Gowargo area of Panjgur district,” Muhammad Zaid, a police officer in Panjgur district, said. The gunmen arrived on a motorbike, entered the barber shop late Sunday evening, opened fire and then fled, police said.The victims’ bodies were moved to a local hospital for post-mortem examinations before being sent to their hometowns.Shahid Rind, Baluchistan govt spokesperson, described the attack as barbaric and intended to sow discord among provinces.No group has claimed the attack. The separatist Baluchistan Liberation Army (BLA) had accepted responsibility for similar attacks in the past. BLA is the most active group in the region; it accuses outsiders of exploiting the rich resources of their province.Last month, militants had executed seven Punjabi labourers after stopping a bus on a highway in Baluchistan and identifying where the passengers were from.Eleven Punjabi labourers were killed after being abducted from a bus in the city of Naushki in April last year, while seven Punjabi barbers were killed a month later near Gwadar Port in the restive province.","Unidentified gunmen shot dead three migrant barbers inside their shop.

Peshawar Shooting Incident: Pakistani man kills WhatsApp group admin in anger after being removed from chat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-man-kills-whatsapp-group-admin-in-anger-after-being-removed-from-chat/articleshow/118803475.cms,"-

A man in Pakistan has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting the admin of a community WhatsApp group who removed him from the chat, police said on Saturday.The shooting took place on Thursday evening in Regi, a locality on the outskirts of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan and has a history of sectarian violence .According to police records and a local official, the suspect, identified as Ashfaq Khan, has been charged with the murder of Mushtaq Ahmed. The dispute began when Mushtaq removed Ashfaq from the WhatsApp group following an argument. Hoping to reconcile, both men agreed to meet, but Ashfaq allegedly arrived with a gun and opened fire, killing Mushtaq on the spot.The police report noted that both men were in the process of reconciliation when the suspect suddenly opened fire. The motive behind the attack was “in reaction to removal from WhatsApp group,” as stated in the report.Humayun Khan, the victim’s brother, told Arab News that he was present at the scene but was unaware of the nature of the dispute.“My slain brother Mushtaq and Ashfaq had developed some differences in a WhatsApp group, forcing my brother to remove the latter. Ashfaq got infuriated and shot my brother dead,” he said. “It was a non-issue or a very trivial matter. No one in our family even knew about the dispute at all.”Local police officer Abid Khan confirmed that Humayun had filed a complaint against Ashfaq, who fled the scene after the attack. Authorities are conducting raids to apprehend him.The incident has triggered widespread reactions on social media, with many expressing sorrow over such violence during the holy fasting month of Ramadan.Easy access to firearms, the influence of tribal customs, and weak law enforcement in the region often contribute to minor disputes spiralling into deadly confrontations.","A man in Pakistan has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting the admin of a community WhatsApp group who removed him from the chat.

The police registered cases against the Ahmadi community members after taking them into protective custody when Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) activists gathered outside their place of worship in Surjani town of Karachi to prevent them from offering ""Friday prayers"".""Today, we arrested six people on the complaint of a TLP activist in Surjani,"" a senior police official said.The approximately 500,000-member Ahmadi community in Pakistan is a religious minority which claims itself as Muslims but was officially declared ""non-Muslim"" in 1974 through an amendment in the constitution.They have faced prosecution from right-wing religious parties notably in the Punjab province in recent times.Amir Mahmood, a community spokesperson, said TLP activists had gathered outside their place of worship since Friday afternoon and threatened to tear it down.DIG West, Irfan Baloch, said the TLP activists demanded the arrest of Ahmadi community leaders and the sealing of their place of worship.Ahmadis have generally done their religious rites inside closed buildings to avoid trouble as their worship places have been destroyed and damaged by right-wing religious protesters in the past.Mahmood said detaining Ahmadis from their place of worship for performing their rituals ""was a grave violation of human rights and Pakistan's Constitution"".DIG Baloch said the police would get a ""legal opinion"" about the place of worship as it was a sensitive matter.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) said on Tuesday it observed a growing trend of mob-led attacks on the homes of families belonging to religious minorities and their places of worship.The HRCP in a report also mentioned the ""arbitrary"" detention of Ahmadis, the alleged desecration of their graves, and the vulnerability of Hindu and Christian women to forced conversion.The HRCP in its report ""Under Siege: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2023-24"" said about 750 persons were in prison on charges of blasphemy as of October last year.It documented at least four faith-based killings, three of which targeted the Ahmadiyya community.","Ahmadis have generally done their religious rites inside closed buildings to avoid trouble.

Taliban-linked outfit claims dozens of Pakistan soldiers killed in cantonment attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/taliban-linked-outfit-claims-dozens-of-pakistan-soldiers-killed-in-cantonment-attack/articleshow/118743228.cms,"Photo/ANI

ISLAMABAD: Anguished cries of mourners preparing to bury their dead pierced an uneasy calm in Bannu cantonment of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Wednesday, a day after 13 civilians and five soldiers were killed in a burst of mayhem caused by militants ramming two explosives-laden vehicles into a wall of the army compound.Seven of the civilian casualties in the violence late Tuesday were children while five were women. Jaish al-Fursan, a militant group linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack and declared that dozens of soldiers were killed.The army said its prompt response to the militant incursion into the cantonment city helped thwart what could have been a suicide attack with far more devastating consequences. All 16 militants involved in the raid were killed, taking the casualties to 34, the military's media wing said.Schools and shops in Bannu city didn't open the morning after and remained shut throughout the day, reflecting that gloom that descended in the area, adjacent to the restive North Waziristan tribal district bordering Afghanistan. This was the second militant attack on the cantonment within a year and the third within Pakistan since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan last Sunday.In a statement shared on social media, Jaish al-Fursan said the blasts were triggered through explosives-laden vehicles.Official sources said the militant raiders blew up the vehicles at the gate after they were intercepted by security personnel stationed at the entrance. The attack started at 6.30pm, minutes after iftar (break in fasting), and was followed by an unspecified number of militants trying to infiltrate the camp. This resulted in a gunfight that continued till the last of the militants were killed.Over a dozen people were buried in the debris of walls and roofs of multiple houses destroyed by the explosions. A mosque next to the cantonment's entrance also collapsed, trapping a number of worshippers in the rubble. They were pulled out of the debris after the fighting ended.A few days earlier, a suicide bomber killed six people at an Islamic religious school in Akora Khattak town of the same province. Several Taliban leaders graduated from this school, infamous as the ""university of jihad"".Last year was the deadliest in a decade for Pakistan, with a surge in attacks in which over 1,600 lives were lost, according to official data.Islamabad accuses Kabul of failing to root out fighters sheltering on its soil and preparing to mount assaults on Pakistan, a charge the Taliban govt stoutly denies.Jaish al-Fursan is headed by Hafiz Gul Bahadur, a commander of what used to be regarded as the ""good Taliban"".","Jaish al-Fursan, a militant group linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack.

ISLAMABAD: US President Donald Trump's announcement to Congress late Tuesday about the capture of most-wanted terrorist Mohammad Sharifulla – mastermind of the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing outside Kabul airport that killed 13 American military service personnel and 170-odd Afghans – came with a surprise pat on Pakistan's back for its role in the operation.""Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice,"" Trump said in his first address to Congress since returning to the White House for a second term.""I want to thank especially the govt of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster,"" he said of the prolonged search culminating in forces tracing Sharifulla to a hideout on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.According to US media reports, CIA and Pakistani intelligence worked closely to find Sharifulla, whom Pakistan described as a ""top-tier operational commander"" of the proscribed Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-KP). The terrorist outfit had claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing that followed the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan that year.Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif was quick to highlight what his govt sees as an opportunity to regain the US's faith as a strategic partner following years of friction, notably after America's exit from Afghanistan and Washington’s growing closeness with India.Within the country, it gives the Sharif govt an advantage over former PM Imran Khan's Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), whose Pakistani-American supporters in the US had campaigned for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. They would possibly be disappointed by Trump's speech to Congress, which included no reference to Imran, PTI or Pakistan's democratic process.Sharif separately announced Sharifullah's arrest through a post on X. ""We thank US President Donald Trump for acknowledging and appreciating Pakistan's role and support in counter terrorism efforts across the region,"" he wrote.""As is well-known, Pakistan has always played a critical role in counter terrorism efforts aimed at denying safe havens to terrorists and militant groups the space to operate against any other country.""In neighbouring India, the reference to ""any other country"" could well spark a debate for a different reason.",US President Donald Trump announced the capture of most-wanted terrorist Mohammad Sharifulla.

The big picture



Renewed counterterrorism cooperation: A Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan’s assistance in the arrest stemmed from “excellent cooperation” between Islamabad and Trump’s new administration. This marks a shift from recent years, where US-Pakistan security collaboration had diminished following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan.

A Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan’s assistance in the arrest stemmed from “excellent cooperation” between Islamabad and Trump’s new administration. This marks a shift from recent years, where US-Pakistan security collaboration had diminished following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan. Regional security concerns: The Islamic State Khorasan, IS’s regional affiliate, has been linked to several high-profile international attacks, including the March 2024 Moscow concert hall bombing that killed over 140 people and the deadly attack in Iran last year. The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations.

The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations. Pakistan’s domestic threats: IS-K has expanded its reach beyond Afghanistan, increasingly targeting Pakistani cities and security forces. Meanwhile, the TTP has launched numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan’s tribal regions. The government has struggled to contain these threats, making counterterrorism cooperation with the US a strategic necessity.

Between the lines



What’s next



US-Pakistan relations: If this counterterrorism cooperation continues, it could lead to a thaw in relations between the two countries, potentially reviving security assistance programs that had been cut in recent years. The US may also push Pakistan to do more against militant safe havens within its borders.

Impact on Pakistan’s security landscape: The arrest of Sharifullah may disrupt IS-K’s operational capabilities in the short term, but the group remains a potent threat. Pakistan will need to step up intelligence-sharing and military operations to prevent retaliatory attacks from IS-K and TTP.

The arrest of Sharifullah may disrupt IS-K’s operational capabilities in the short term, but the group remains a potent threat. Pakistan will need to step up intelligence-sharing and military operations to prevent retaliatory attacks from IS-K and TTP. Broader implications for Afghanistan: This arrest further highlights Afghanistan’s growing role as a sanctuary for international terrorist networks. The Taliban’s ability (or unwillingness) to suppress IS-K will be a key issue for regional stability.

Pakistani security forces played a crucial role in capturing Mohammad Sharifullah , a top commander of the Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K), who was allegedly responsible for the devastating suicide bombing outside Kabul airport in August 2021. The attack, which occurred during the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan, killed 13 US service members and 170 Afghan civilians.President Donald Trump, in his first address to Congress since his return to the White House, announced that Pakistan had helped arrest “the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity.” While he did not provide details about the operation, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later confirmed that Sharifullah was apprehended in a counterterrorism raid along the Pakistan-Afghan border.Pakistan’s involvement in this high-profile counterterrorism operation could significantly reshape its relationship with the US.By assisting in Sharifullah’s arrest, Pakistan is signaling its willingness to re-engage with Washington on security matters.This move comes as Pakistan faces increasing pressure from militant groups, including IS-K and the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which have intensified attacks within the country.The operation could help Islamabad gain favor with the US, potentially unlocking military and economic assistance at a time when Pakistan is grappling with financial instability.Pakistan’s decision to assist in Sharifullah’s arrest is not just about counterterrorism—it is also about geopolitics. The country’s strategic importance has waned since the US and Nato withdrawal from Afghanistan, but this operation could help Islamabad regain relevance in Washington’s security calculus.South Asia expert Michael Kugelman noted that Pakistan is trying to “leverage US concerns about terror in Afghanistan and pitch a renewed security partnership.”At the same time, Pakistan’s cooperation might be seen as a balancing act. Islamabad has maintained complex ties with the Afghan Taliban, and it remains to be seen how Kabul will react to this development.The US justice department has charged Sharifullah with ""providing and conspiring to provide material support and resources"" to the group.""He confessed. This was the planner of that bombing,"" White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said in an interview with Fox News.FBI director Kash Patel said Sharifullah was in US custody, in a post on X alongside a picture of agents standing in front of the plane that he was due to arrive on.""That time you delivered the sword of justice for the American people- thank you for your incredible leadership @AGPamBondi and @JohnRatcliffe.

ISLAMABAD: At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque of an Islamic religious school known as the “university of jihad” in Nowshera district of Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province on Friday.Among the dead were Maulana Hamid-ul-Haq Haqqani , head of Dar-ul-Uloom Haqqania school, the seminary in Nowshera’s Akora Khattak town where key Afghan Taliban leaders have studied. Mullah Omer, the slain founder of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, was also an alumni of this religious school.Graduates of the seminary include current Afghan Taliban leaders Amir Khan Muttaqi, Sirajuddin Haqqani, Abdul Latif Mansoor, Maulvi Ahmad Jan, Mullah Jalaludin Haqani, Maulvi Qalamudin, Arifullah Arif and Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa.The explosion occurred in the main prayer hall as people gathered for weekly Friday prayers were leaving the mosque.KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed confirmed that it was a suicide attack and that three policemen were also injured. “More than a dozen police officers were guarding the mosque when the attack occurred, and Haq’s seminary also had its own security,” he said.“It appears that Hamid Haqqani (seminary’s slain chief) was the target,” Hameed added.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, which came on the last Friday ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Yawar Zia, a police constable, who was injured in the attack, said he was on security duty at the seminary when the blast happened and splinters hit him. “After offering prayer, Hamid-ul-Haq, accompanied by his guards, was leaving the mosque when the powerful explosion occurred,” the wounded official said.Eyewitnesses described a chaotic scene, with blood and body parts scattered all over the place. They said the casualties could have been much higher had the bomber struck during the prayers.Haqqani, the son of slain prominent Pakistani cleric Sami-ul-Haq Haqqani, known as the “father of Taliban, was a vice-chancellor of the sprawling seminary, located 60 km from the provincial capital of Peshawar. Following his father’s assassination in 2018, he also became chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Sami (JUI-S) political party. He had also previously served as a member of the National Assembly from 2002 to 2007.Haq was also among the few who called on the world and Pakistan to immediately recognise the Taliban govt and establish diplomatic relations with Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul in 2021.Last year, he led a delegation of religious scholars to Afghanistan for “religious diplomacy” meetings with Taliban leaders.His seminary had faced controversy in the past as its students were accused of involvement in the assassination of Pakistan’s former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. The madrasa, however, denied any connection with the suspects.","At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque.

Nepal’s former King Gyanendra Shah was greeted with the chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday, amid growing calls for the reinstatement of the monarchy and Nepal’s status as a Hindu state.According to the news agency AFP, Shah’s supporters waved Nepal’s flag and chanted slogans like ""Come king, save the nation!"" as the 77-year-old former monarch stepped out of Tribhuvan International Airport following a tour of western Nepal.The crowd, which included members of the pro-monarchist Rastriya Prajatantra Party , carried placards reading ""We want our King back"" and ""Abolish federal republican system and reinstate the monarchy.""AP reported that an estimated 10,000 supporters gathered outside the airport, blocking its main entrance. Passengers were forced to walk to and from the airport due to the heavy crowd. Riot police were deployed to prevent demonstrators from entering the premises, but no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 240-year-old monarchy in 2008 after a decade-long civil war that left over 16,000 dead. However, dissatisfaction with political instability, corruption and economic struggles has fuelled a resurgence of support for the former royal family.“The country faces instability, prices are high, people are jobless, and there is a lack of education and healthcare facilities,” said Rajindra Kunwar, a teacher who joined the rally who was quoted by AFP. “The poor are dying of hunger.

Can Gyanendra return to power?

Chants of ""Long live our beloved king"" and ""Vacate the royal palace for the king"" echoed through the streets of Kathmandu on Sunday as thousands of supporters of Nepal's former king, Gyanendra Shah , gathered to demand the restoration of the monarchy and Hinduism as the state religion.An estimated 10,000 royalists blocked the main entrance to Tribhuvan International Airport as Gyanendra returned from a tour of western Nepal. Protesters waved flags and carried banners calling for the former king’s reinstatement. The demonstration disrupted airport operations, forcing passengers to walk to and from the terminal, while hundreds of riot police prevented demonstrators from entering the airport. Despite the intensity of the protest, no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule. The country became a federal democratic republic, but since then, many Nepalis have grown frustrated with political instability and economic struggles.Since the abolition of the monarchy, Nepal has seen 13 different governments, leading many to believe the current system has failed. Corruption, economic hardship, and lack of political stability have left some citizens reconsidering their stance on monarchy.""We are here to give the king our full support and to rally behind him all the way to reinstating him in the royal throne,"" said Thir Bahadur Bhandari, a 72-year-old protester.Kulraj Shrestha, a 50-year-old carpenter, admitted he had initially opposed the monarchy but had since changed his mind. ""I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken. The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind,"" he said.Despite the growing support, Gyanendra has not commented on the renewed calls for his return. Political analysts believe his chances of regaining the throne remain slim in the near future. The republic is constitutionally enshrined, and mainstream political parties remain opposed to reinstating the monarchy.Gyanendra, who first became king in 2002 after the tragic massacre of his brother King Birendra and his family, initially ruled as a constitutional monarch. However, in 2005, he seized absolute power, dissolving the government and parliament, jailing politicians and journalists, and imposing emergency rule. His authoritarian rule led to the mass protests that ultimately resulted in the abolition of the monarchy.","Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule.

Ongoing global criticism



International pressure and Taliban's isolation



On International Women's Day, the Taliban issued a statement asserting their commitment to safeguarding the rights of Afghan women.Chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid posted on his official X account, stating that the ''Islamic Emirate assumes full responsibility for the provision and safeguarding of the rights of Afghan women.''Without directly referencing International Women's Day, Mujahid said that dignity, honor, and legal rights for women remain a priority for the Taliban government.He claimed that Afghan women ''live in security, both physically and psychologically''and that their ''fundamental rights'' — such as autonomy in marital decisions, dowry entitlements, and inheritance — are protected.The Taliban's statement comes as the United Nations continues to denounce the severe restrictions on Afghan women.Since seizing control in 2021, the Taliban have imposed sweeping bans on education and employment for women. Girls were barred from secondary education, and later, from attending and teaching at Kabul University.In August 2023, the Vice and Virtue Ministry expanded restrictions, prohibiting women's voices in public and mandating full face coverings outside the home.On Saturday, the UN renewed its call for these bans to be lifted. ''The erasure of women and girls from public life cannot be ignored,'' said Roza Otunbayeva, head of the UN mission in Afghanistan.Alison Davidian, special representative for UN Women Afghanistan, added, ""We must stand with Afghan women as if our own lives depend on it — because they do.""Mujahid emphasized distinctions in Afghan and Western notions of women's rights. He said ''Afghan women's rights are situated within the specific context of an Islamic and Afghan society, which exhibits distinct divergences from Western societies and their cultural paradigms.''The Taliban remain globally isolated, with no official recognition as running Afghanistan's government due to their policies on women. In January, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor requested arrest warrants for two senior Taliban officials for their role in repressing Afghan women.Last Friday, Unesco hosted a high-level conference on women and girls in Afghanistan, featuring activists, parliamentarians, and rights experts. They included Hamida Aman, founder of the women-only station Radio Begum, former Afghan lawmaker Fawzia Koofi and human rights expert Richard Bennett, who has been barred from entering Afghanistan.In response, Saif ul-Islam Khyber, a spokesman for the Vice and Virtue Ministry, dismissed such gatherings, calling them an ''exposure of the hypocrisy of certain organizations and European Union foundations.''","The Taliban issued a statement asserting their commitment to safeguarding the rights of Afghan women.

Bangladesh sees 'troubling' rise in cases of rape and assault on women,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-sees-troubling-rise-in-cases-of-rape-and-assault-on-women/articleshow/118809920.cms,"Representative image

DHAKA: Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus voiced strong concern over recent reports of attacks on women, calling them ""deeply troubling"" and a clear deviation from the vision of a ""New Bangladesh"" that the nation's people strive for.His comment, made at an International Women's Day event, came in the aftermath of the harrowing plight of an eight-year-old girl who is fighting for her life after being allegedly raped. This case is not an isolated incident but part of a broader, grim trend of sexual violence that has plagued the country. Reports of rape, gang rape, sexual assault and harassment have become disturbingly frequent.Addressing the situation of violence against women in Bangladesh that remained troubling since last year, with shocking numbers reported in the first two months, Fauzia Moslem, president of Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, said, ""Society is descending into chaos, where lawlessness and criminal impunity are growing. The failure of law enforcement, compromises, and lack of accountability are empowering criminals.""A report by the Manabadhikar Shongskriti Foundation (MSF) in Dhaka revealed that Feb 2025 documented 295 incidents of violence against women and children, 24 more than in Jan. It noted that Islamic fundamentalist groups, terrorists, and other extremist elements play a visible role in these incidents.A total of 21 women from various professions told local media that they experienced sexual harassment outside the home in past three months. The women, aged between 19 and 48 and residing in Dhaka, reported multiple instances.According to Dhaka-based human rights organisation Ain o Salish Kendra, in Feb, 46 women were victims of rape, 22 of whom were under 18. In Jan, this number was 39, including 15 minors.(With inputs from ANI)","Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus voiced strong concern over recent reports of attacks on women.

The organisation was termed as a ""terrorist organisation"" by India for trying to ""establish Islamic state and caliphate globally"".The ""March for Khilafat"" was joined by the thousands and the rally began from the north gate of Baitul Mukarram National Mosque in the capital city. The clashes erupted when the police intervened to stop the march, Dhaka Tribune reported.The procession initially proceeded without disruption, but tensions flared as demonstrators moved from Paltan towards Bijoynagar, where police set up a blockade. In response, Hizb ut-Tahrir members resisted, triggering a chase between both sides.To disperse the crowd, police fired tear gas shells and sound grenades, temporarily scattering the demonstrators. However, they later regrouped and attempted to resume their procession. As tensions escalated, law enforcement once again deployed tear gas, while protesters retaliated by hurling bricks and stones at officers. The confrontation intensified, resulting in the arrest of several Hizb ut-Tahrir members, Dhaka Tribune reported.The group remains a banned organization in Bangladesh, with all its activities and demonstrations declared illegal.The march comes amid rising concerns of violence against minorities and recent attacks on cultural, religious, and diplomatic properties in the south Asian nation, as raised by India at several occasions, especially after the ouster of former Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina last year.This was reiterated by a UN report released in January which revealed that members of Bangladesh's Hindu, Ahmadiyya Muslim, and indigenous communities faced human rights abuses during the anti-discrimination protests that led to the fall of Sheikh Hasina's government in 204 and its aftermath.It said that even though authorities had reportedly made 100 arrests in connection with the attacks, many perpetrators of revenge violence and targeted assaults continued to enjoy impunity.India declared Hizb ut-Tahrir a terrorist organisation last year and said that the group was ""involved in various acts of terror, including radicalising the gullible youths to join terrorist organisations and raise funds for terror activities, posing a serious threat to the national security and sovereignty of India. The Modi government is committed to securing Bharat by dealing the forces of terror with an iron fist.”“HuT is an organisation which aims to establish Islamic state and caliphate globally, including in India, by overthrowing democratically elected governments through jihad and terrorist activities by involving citizens of the country, which is a grave threat to the democratic setup and internal security of the country,” the ministry of home affairs had said.","Hizb ut-Tahrir held its first open rally in Dhaka on Friday against Bangladeshi administration's orders.

A massive rescue operation is underway after an oil tanker and a cargo ship collided in the North Sea off the East Yorkshire coast on Monday, sparking a massive fire and injuring 32 people.According to the BBC, the incident occurred near the Humber Estuary, with HM Coastguard receiving the alert at 09.48 GMT. Multiple lifeboats and a Coastguard helicopter were dispatched to the scene.The incident, which took place near the port city of Hull, has resulted in 32 casualties being brought ashore, while some crew members remain unaccounted for, according to Martyn Boyers, chief executive of the Port of Grimsby East. Boyers further described the incident as a ""massive fireball.""The vessels involved were identified as the US-flagged Stena Immaculate tanker , which had transported petroleum products from Greece, and the Portuguese-flagged Solong container ship, owned by German company Reederei Koepping, according to Marine Traffic data.Videos circulating online showed a massive plume of thick, black smoke and flames billowing from the site, located approximately 10 miles (16 kilometers) offshore.Erik Hanell, chief executive of Stena Bulk, told BBC that all crew members aboard Stena Immaculate were safe and accounted for. Earlier, the RNLI reported ""that a number of people had abandoned the vessels following a collision and there were fires on both ships"".""It's too far out for us to see - about 10 miles - but we have seen the vessels bringing them in. They must have sent a mayday out - luckily there was a crew transfer vessel out there already,"" Boyers said.""Since then there has been a flotilla of ambulances to pick up anyone they can find. The casualties' conditions remain unclear,"" he added.The UK Coastguard is leading the rescue operation following ""reports of a collision between a tanker and cargo vessel off the coast of East Yorkshire"", a spokesperson told AFP. Authorities are also assessing the necessary counter-pollution response.Earlier in October 2023, a collision between two cargo ships, the Verity and the Polesie, near Germany's Heligoland islands in the North Sea resulted in three fatalities, while two others remain missing and are presumed dead.","Oil tanker and cargo ship collide in North Sea off East Yorkshire coast, sparking massive fire. 32 casualties have been brought ashore, while some crew members remain unaccounted for.
