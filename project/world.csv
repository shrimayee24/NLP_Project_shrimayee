6 Signs that you’re heading towards liver cirrhosis

Meningitis is a deadly brain infection that causes inflammation of the tissues surrounding the brain, which helps protect the brain and spinal cord, also known as meninges. Meningitis can be caused by bacteria, virus, fungi, or parasites, but the most dangerous form of meningitis which can kill within 24 hours is caused by bacteria and requires urgent treatment.Most cases of meningitis in the United States are caused by a viral infection. It can also be caused by bacteria, parasites and fungi. Meningitis can vary in severity, appropriate treatment and care depending on the cause.World Meningitis Day is celebrated annually on October 5 to raise awareness about the condition, which can have serious implications. Meningitis has 5 million cases all over the world every year. The day was established in 2008.Meningitis can spread by people who carry bacteria or viruses in their throat or nose. Bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening disease that can cause death within 24 hours or permanent impairment. Meningitis is a medical emergency and should be treated accordingly. It can also be prevented with prior vaccinations.People with meningitis may have flu-like symptoms initially, but they may worsen over a course of a few days or hours.High feverSevere headacheVomitingNeck stiffnessSeizuresNausea and vomitingLack of energySleepiness or trouble staying awakeSkin rashMeningitis can sometimes have serious complications like sepsis, or blood poisoning, which may require a limb amputation in some cases.

The bacteria that cause meningitis can spread through respiratory droplets from an infected person's nose or throat. This can happen while coughing, kissing, sneezing or touching the infected surface. The bacteria can be carried in the throat, and can sometimes overwhelm the body's defenses.Meningitis can also be spread through contact with an infected person's feces, eye, nose, or mouth secretions. This can happen when one touches the infected person's hand or surfaces infected with the virus. Insects such as mosquitoes can also spread viruses that can cause meningitis.It is important to wash hands after touching suspected infected surfaces.Children should get vaccinated to avoid the deadly meningitis infection.Caregivers or medical teams handling such patients must wear personal protective equipment (PPE).","Most cases of meningitis in the United States are caused by a viral infection.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly criticised French President Emmanuel Macron ’s recent call for an arms embargo against Israel , labelling it a “shame”. In a video message released on Saturday, Netanyahu expressed outrage over Macron’s stance and the actions of other Western leaders calling for similar measures.He further asserted that ""all civilised countries "" should be standing alongside Israel as it battles against what he described as “forces of barbarism,” led by Iran .""As Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilised countries should be standing firmly by Israel's side. Yet President Macron and some other western leaders are now calling for an arms embargo against Israel. Shame on them. Is Iran imposing an arms embargo on Hezbollah , on the Houthis, on Hamas and on its other proxies? Of course not. The axis of terror stands together, but countries that supposedly oppose this terror axis call for an arms embargo on Israel. What a disgrace,"" Netanyahu declared.The Israeli Prime Minister highlighted that while countries such as Iran continue to arm militant groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, Israel is being targeted with demands for disarmament, a move he perceives as unjust. He framed the conflict as a struggle not just for Israel but for the entire civilised world against radical forces seeking to bring about destruction and chaos.Netanyahu's comments come amidst growing international debate over the balance between supporting Israel’s right toself-defence and concerns about escalating violence in the region. However, the Israeli leader remained resolute in his position, expressing frustration that leaders of Western countries, like Macron, are not fully backing Israel in its efforts to combat what he termed as an ""axis of terror.""In his statement, Netanyahu provided an overview of Israel’s ongoing military engagements on multiple fronts. ""Today, Israel is defending itself on seven fronts against the enemies of civilisation. We're fighting in Gaza against Hamas, those savages who murdered, raped, beheaded, and burned our people on October 7,"" he said.He further elaborated on the threats posed by Hezbollah in Lebanon, which, according to Netanyahu, had planned a massacre greater than the attacks of October 7 on Israel’s northern border. He added that Israel was also combating missile and drone attacks from Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, as well as militias in Iraq and Syria.""We're fighting against the Houthis in Yemen and the Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria that together have launched hundreds of drones and missile attacks against Israel. We're fighting against terrorists in Judea and Samaria, who are trying to murder civilians in the heart of our cities. And we're fighting against Iran, which last week fired over 200 ballistic missiles directly at Israel and which stands behind the seven-front war against Israel,"" Netanyahu said.In a defiant tone, Netanyahu assured the world that Israel would emerge victorious, with or without support from the international community. He criticised countries advocating for an arms embargo as being complicit in allowing terrorism to thrive. Despite the opposition, Netanyahu vowed that Israel would continue its fight until it achieves total victory.""Well, let me tell you this. Israel will win with or without their support. But their shame will continue long after the war is won. For in defending ourselves against this barbarism, Israel is defending civilisation, against those who seek to impose a dark age of fanaticism on all of us. Rest assured, Israel will fight until the battle is won for our sake and for the sake of the peace and security of the entire world,"" Netanyahu concluded.Earlier on Sunday, the French President issued a video message and emphasised the need of an immediate ceasefire in the region.After PM Netanyahu’s condemnation of the move, Macron’s office gave clarification on the move and said “France is Israel's steadfast friend"" and ""supports Israel's security and demonstrates it"", reported Times of Israel. However, it still justified the embargo by stating that it was necessary to avoid further escalation and bring peace to the region.","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly criticised French President Emmanuel Macron ’s recent call for an arms embargo against Israel. In a video message released on Saturday, Netanyahu expressed outrage over Macron’s stance. He further asserted that ""all civilised countries "" should be standing alongside Israel as it battles against what he described as “forces of barbarism,” led by Iran.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113976769,imgsize-896063,width-400,resizemode-4/113976769.jpg"
Harry Meghan News: Real reason why Prince Harry spent his birthday night apart from Meghan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/real-reason-why-prince-harry-spent-his-birthday-night-apart-from-meghan/articleshow/113972991.cms,"As Prince Harry is on a solo trip and rumors of Harry-Meghan divorce are rife, it has now come to be reported that Harry did not spend the night of his 40th birthday with Meghan though he was in the US at that time. While many reports call it the ""latest blow to their marriage"", their friends claim that it was actually a gift from Meghan and the couple are not separating -- they are professionally choosing different paths.Meghan was last seen before Harry's birthday. The Duchess of Sussex reportedly booked the trip for Harry so that he could spend the night of his 40th birthday doing a hike on the Montecito peak -- which is part of the Cold Spring Trail in California. It is near Harry-Meghan's mansion.Soon after Harry's birthday, he started his solo tour which has now been extended by a few days and Harry has scheduled some secret meetings. Reports claimed Harry and Meghan have been staying apart and Harry was found moping around by himself at a local cafe. It was when reports of his longing to be back to the Royal Family emerged. It was reported that Harry was feeling homesick as Meghan was busy with her Hollywood and entrepreneurial projects.Sources close to the couple who emphasize that they are not splitting claimed that the phase of Harry moping is over and now he has immersed himself in work according to his liking. Meghan was supposed to accompany him on his tour to New York but she was unwell. From New York, Harry flew to the UK and it was obvious that Meghan would not accompany him there.From UK, Harry went to Africa for a charity event but now Harry has extended his solo trip. Harry was initially scheduled to be back in California this weekend, UK Express reported. But he has chosen to prolong his solo trip. The Duke will likely head to Johannesburg and Cape Town for ""private time"" with family and friends. Another secret visit is also planned but it has been kept out of his official diary, the report said.",Prince Harry did not spend the night of his 40th birthday with Meghan though he was in the US at that time.

Death toll from Hurricane Helene rises to 227 as grim task of recovering bodies continues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/death-toll-from-hurricane-helene-rises-to-227-as-grim-task-of-recovering-bodies-continues/articleshow/113976902.cms,"Death toll from Hurricane Helene rises to 227 as grim task of recovering bodies continues

FRANKFORT: The death toll from Hurricane Helene inched up to 227 on Saturday as the grim task of recovering bodies continued more than a week after the monster storm ravaged the Southeast and killed people in six states.Helene came ashore Sept. 26 as a Category 4 hurricane and carved a wide swath of destruction as it moved northward from Florida, washing away homes, destroying roads and knocking out electricity and cellphone service for millions.The number of deaths stood at 225 on Friday; two more were recorded in South Carolina the following day. It was still unclear how many people were unaccounted for or missing, and the toll could rise even higher.Helene is the deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina in 2005. About half the victims were in North Carolina , while dozens more were killed in Georgia and South Carolina. The city of Asheville, in the western mountains of North Carolina, was particularly battered.North Carolinians so far have received more than $27 million in individual assistance approved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said MaryAnn Tierney, a regional administrator for the agency. More than 83,000 people have registered for individual assistance, according to the office of Gov. Roy Cooper.In Buncombe County, where Asheville is located, FEMA-approved assistance has surpassed $12 million for survivors, Tierney said Saturday during a news briefing.""This is critical assistance that will help people with their immediate needs, as well as displacement assistance that helps them if they can't stay in their home,"" she said.She encouraged residents impacted by the storm to register for disaster assistance .""It is the first step in the recovery process,"" she said. ""We can provide immediate relief in terms of serious needs assistance to replace food, water, medicines, other life safety, critical items, as well as displacement assistance if you cannot stay in your home.""Helene's raging floodwaters shocked mountain towns hundreds of miles inland and far from where the storm made landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast, including in the Tennessee mountains that Dolly Parton calls home.The country music star has announced a $1 million donation to the Mountain Ways Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to providing immediate assistance to Hurricane Helene flood victims.In addition, her East Tennessee businesses as well as the Dollywood Foundation are combining efforts, pledging to match her donation to Mountain Ways with a $1 million contribution.Parton said she feels a close connection to the storm victims because so many of them ""grew up in the mountains just like I did.""""I can't stand to see anyone hurting, so I wanted to do what I could to help after these terrible floods,"" she said. ""I hope we can all be a little bit of light in the world for our friends, our neighbors - even strangers - during this dark time they are experiencing.""Walmart U.S. President and CEO John Furner said the company, including Sam's Club and the Walmart Foundation, would increase its commitment and donate a total of $10 million to hurricane relief efforts.In Newport, an eastern Tennessee town of about 7,000, residents continued cleaning up Saturday from the destruction caused by Helene's floodwaters.Mud still clung to the basement walls of one Main Street funeral home. The ground-floor chapel of another nearby was being dried out, a painting of Jesus still hanging on the wall in an otherwise barren room.Newport City Hall and its police department also took on water from the swollen Pigeon River. Some of the modest, one-story homes along its banks were destroyed, their walls crumbled and rooms exposed.Farther east in unincorporated Del Rio, along a bend in the French Broad River, residents and volunteers toiled to clean up. The smell of wood hung in the air as people used chainsaws to cut through downed trees, and Bobcats beeped as they moved mangled sheet metal and other debris. Many homes sustained damage, including one that slid off its foundation.","Helene is the deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina in 2005.

Diddy: Diddy sex tapes: Attorney claims 3 A-list celebs involved in compromising situation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/diddy-sex-tapes-attorney-claims-3-a-list-celebs-involved-in-compromising-situation/articleshow/113970859.cms,"Attorney Ariel Mitchel-Kidd who represented Adria English, one of the early accusers of Sean ""Diddy"" Combs claimed that she has been told about the existence of three sex tapes featuring three A-list celebrities. She said she has not seen all of them and there might be many other such tapes involving other celebrities. “The individuals who contacted me purported to have three different tapes with three different celebrities, including Diddy, and then a fourth celebrity without Diddy but in a compromising situation with someone,” the lawyer claimed on NewsNation.Mitchell-Kidd added that it is believed the person in the alleged fourth tape was recorded at one of Combs’ homes, and said the other three individuals were reportedly “A-list celebrities.”Mitchell said she can't attest whether these tapes exists or not. “I just was told initially that ‘they’ own this treasure trove of videos, so I have to believe that there are a lot of celebrities who know what they did ….”An officer who took part in the raids on Diddy's Miami home back in March confirmed to the New York Post that there are recognizable named in the footage that they obtained and there are more than one. The revelation comes as reports claimed such tapes are being shopped around in Hollywood and one of them features a star more high profile than Diddy.Texas attorney Tony Buzbee made sensational revelations regarding the case that he would be representing 120 more accusers. He set up a hotline to address more sexual allegations against Diddy and the hotline received over 20,000 calls in 24 hours. Many of Diddy's victims -- the new ones -- were minors and Diddy promised them careers in music. A 26-year-old woman was given a drink in Diddy's car and then woke up next day not knowing what happened but with pain and damage to both her vagina and anus. A pregnant woman had a nonalcoholic beverage at a Diddy party and then woke up allegedly in the same bed with Diddy in his Miami mansion with her vagina and anus torn and sore.","Ariel Mitchel-Kidd, who represented Adria English, one of the early accusers of Sean ""Diddy"" Combs claimed that she has been told about the existence of three sex tapes featuring three A-list celebrities.

Trump goes nuclear for Israel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-goes-nuclear-for-israel/articleshow/113969960.cms,"WASHINGTON: Demonstrating a startling contrast to the restraint advocated to Israel by US President Joe Biden and Washington's European allies, MAGA maverick Donald Trump wants the Jewish state to hit Iran 's nuclear facilities first and ""worry about the rest later.""Speaking at campaign event in North Carolina on Friday, Trump ridiculed Biden's advice to Israel to exercise proportional response to the Iran's 200- missile attack, saying, ""his answer should have been ""'Hit the nuclear first, worry about the rest later.' It was not clear if the ""rest"" referred to other facilities or to the consequences.Trump made similar comments in an interview with Fox News on Thursday, saying Biden's response on Israel attacking Iran was the ""craziest thing I’ve ever heard,"" arguing, ""soon they will have nuclear weapons and then you will have problems.""Foreign policy traditionalists in turn saw Trump's suggestion as crazy considering the potential fall-out from hitting a nuclear site. By some accounts, Iran is only a year or two, if not a few months, from a working nuclear weapon.Trump has previously shown a cavalier -- and sometimes bizarre -- approach to matters nuclear even while expressing awe about its power. During his Presidency he boasted about having a bigger nuclear button than North Korea and suggested nuking hurricanes to stop them from reaching the United States.Biden on Wednesday expressed his opposition to Israel striking Iran’s nuclear facilities, in response to the firing of nearly 200 Iranian missiles towards Israel. “We’ll be discussing with the Israelis what they’re going to do,” he said, adding that allG7 members agree Israel has “a right to respond, but they should respond in proportion.”But for a movement that is largely anti-war, Trump's MAGA surrogates surprisingly pitched for a hardball Israeli response against the backdrop of the Presidential election. Some of it was rooted in Israel's existential crisis as a Jewish state surrounded by Arab Muslim nations.“For the sake of our friends in Israel, we cannot allow the world to miscalculate Iran, just as it did with Hitler and the Nazis. Would a proportional response be launching 200 ballistic missiles from Israel into Iran, mimicking what the Iranians did to Israel?"" asked Trump factotum Senator Lindsey Graham“To my friends in Israel, one holocaust directed at the Jewish people is enough. Do what you have to do to defend yourselves against those who would kill you simply because you are Jewish,"" he added.There was also a domestic political connection to the issue. Jews constitute only 2.4% of the US adult population, but they are more likely to vote than the general registered voting population and to make political donations. A survey by the Jewish Democratic Council of America last month showed Jewish vote falling 68-25 for Kamala Harris, causing a Trump lament that Jews will be partly to blame if he loses.Kamala Harris, whose husband Doug Emhoff is Jewish, is doing a tightrope walk balancing traditional US support for Israel while also advocating restraint to save civilian lives.She was in Michigan -- a battleground state -- on Friday meeting several Muslim groups in a state which has more than 300,000 Muslim-American votes. At the other end, Pennsylvania, which also a battleground, also has about 300,000 voting-age Jews. In 2020, Biden won Michigan by 154,000 votes and Pennsylvania by 80,000 votes."," MAGA maverick Donald Trump wants the Jewish state to hit Iran's nuclear facilities first and ""worry about the rest later"" It was not clear if the ""rest"" referred to other facilities or to the consequences.

Over a 100 PTI members were arrested from Islamabad and more than 600 workers were detained in Lahore, where also Imran’s supporters were staging a protest on his call. Throughout the day violent clashes were reported between PTI protesters and law enforcement officials, with frequent instances of stone-pelting and tear-gas exchanges being witnessed.There was high drama in the evening when police and paramilitary Rangers stormed the official guesthouse and administrative office for the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province in Islamabad, apparently to arrest chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur, who was assigned by Imran to lead the protest.“KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has been arrested from KP House in Islamabad,” PTI said in a WhatsApp message. “He has been tricked. And Arrest. KP House sealed,” PTI international spokesperson Zulfiqar Bukhari said in the WhatsApp message, adding that it amounted to an attack on the federation.When asked how the CM was “tricked”, Bukhari said Gandapur was asked to hold talks with the govt but was arrested instead.Later, PTI politicians retracted their claims about Gandapur’s arrest. Nawaz Mehmood, a PTI politician, said Gandapur had not been arrested. “He has been detained inside KP House in the capital by law enforcement personnel,” he added.","The situation remained tense in Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Lahore on Saturday as supporters of the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf ( PTI ) clashed with police and paramilitary forces.

Supporters of former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan reached Islamabad's iconic D-Chowk late on Saturday, despite the government's efforts to deter them by deploying a heavy police force and cutting off internet services in the capital. The police's use of tear gas to stop protesters was largely ineffective as heavy rain in the capital weakened its impact, Dawn reported.Meanwhile, the Islamabad high court ordered the Pakistan government to prevent any illegal protests in the capital during the SCO summit.However, the court instructed government to assign a specific location for supporters of jailed former PM to hold demonstrations.Islamabad was placed under a strict lockdown on Saturday as authorities sought to prevent the demonstration, which comes in support of the imprisoned cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan. His supporters have been consistently staging protests over the past month, demanding his release.The rallies also target the ruling coalition government, which Khan's party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ), claims is illegitimate, alleging that it came to power following a fraudulent election.Pakistan army troops were deployed in Islamabad to ensure security as Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters moved forward with plans for a protest.Meanwhile, Pakistan's interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said that more than 80 police personnel have been injured so far in clashes with supporters of Imran Khan taking part in a march near Islamabad.Khan, who was barred from participating in the February elections due to numerous legal cases against him, has been sidelined from the political arena. However, Imran Khan's PTI has continued to challenge the government by organising regular demonstrations and protests despite facing a crackdown.Earlier in the day, the PTI claimed that Pakistani Rangers “forcefully entered” KP House in Islamabad to arrest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur after he arrived in the capital to take part in the protest.PTI workers set out from Khan's stronghold in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Friday, intending to reach the capital Islamabad. However, they were met with roadblocks made of shipping containers and rounds of tear gas fired by security forces.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi warned Khan's party on Friday to cancel the planned protest, saying that there would be ""no leniency"" if the ban on protests is defied. He accused armed supporters of Khan of marching on Islamabad with the intention of launching an assault on the capital. “They should think about what they are going to do with Pakistan by marching on Islamabad with weapons,” he said.“I am very clear that they are going to launch an assault on Islamabad,” Naqvi said. He urged Imran Khan's party to postpone their rally to avoid disrupting the capital city's preparations for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting on October 15 and 16.On Saturday, small groups of protesters persisted in their efforts to enter the capital, defying the government's decision to deploy troops on the streets. The government justified the deployment as a necessary measure to ensure security ahead of the upcoming SCO.""I am so proud of all our people,"" Khan said in a message posted on the social media platform X on Saturday afternoon. ""You showed unfaltering resilience and courage as you came out yesterday and overcame unbelievable obstacles to keep marching forward towards D Chowk.""Lahore's D-Chowk or Democracy Chowk is known in Pakistan as the place where various protests routinely take place. In the past, Imran Khan had a 126-day sit-in protest here in 2014.Imran Khan urged citizens to continue their journey to D Chowk and join the convoy led by Ali Amin. ""I am calling on everyone to keep heading to D Chowk and join Ali Amin's convoy. I especially want to commend our people from KP, North Punjab, and Islamabad. You have defeated insurmountable obstacles, including shelling, chemicals fired from helicopters, trenches & nails on the motorway, with your determination and commitment,"" Imran Khan said.The former Prime Minister also called upon the people of Punjab to gather at Minar-i-Pakistan in Lahore. ""I am also asking our people from Punjab to move towards Minar-e-Pakistan in Lahore. If they cannot make it there, they must join the protests in their cities,"" he said.Protests were also planned in Lahore on Saturday, but access to the city was restricted as the main road connecting it to the capital was blocked. Amnesty International criticised the communication cuts and road blockades, saying that they ""infringe on people's right to freedom of expression, access to information, peaceful assembly and movement."" The rights group further added, ""These restrictions are part of a worrying clampdown on the right to protest in Pakistan.""Imran Khan, 72, served as Pakistan's Prime Minister from 2018 to 2022 before being removed from office through a parliamentary no-confidence vote. His ousting came after he fell out of favour with the powerful military establishment, which is considered to be the kingmaker in Pakistani politics.Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif's government has claimed that Khan's party aims to weaken the country's economy through violent protests despite the threat posed by the Pakistani Taliban.Despite Imran Khan being in jail since August 2023, candidates supported by him secured the most seats in the general election held in February.

Six soldiers and as many terrorists were killed in a gunfight in Pakistan's volatile Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, according to a statement from the Pakistan military on Saturday.Inter-Services Public Relations ( ISPR ), the military's media wing, said that the exchange of fire occurred during the night between October 4-5 in the Spinwam area of North Waziristan district, which shares a border with Afghanistan.Lieutenant colonel Muhammad Ali Shoukat, aged 43, who was leading the operation against the terrorists, lost his life along with five other soldiers during the ""intense fire exchange"", the Pakistan military said.The banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has claimed responsibility for the attack. The TTP, established in 2007 as an umbrella organization for several militant groups, has been officially declared as 'Fitna al-Khawarij' by the Pakistani government. The interior ministry's notification emphasizes the use of the term 'khariji' (outlawed) when referring to such terrorists.Pakistan has repeatedly accused the TTP of operating from sanctuaries in Afghanistan, a claim that the Afghan Taliban denies. Since the Taliban's takeover of the government in Kabul in 2021, there has been a rise in terrorist incidents in Pakistan, shattering hopes in Islamabad that a friendly government in Afghanistan would help combat militancy.The relationship between the two countries has recently become strained, primarily due to the TTP and frequent border skirmishes.",Six soldiers and as many terrorists were killed in a gunfight in Pakistan's volatile Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
