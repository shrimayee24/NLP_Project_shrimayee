'No credentials to speak about protecting civilians': India slams Pakistan’s 'grossly hypocritical' remarks at UN,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-credentials-to-speak-about-protecting-civilians-india-slams-pakistans-grossly-hypocritical-remarks-at-un/articleshow/121372782.cms,"India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish

NEW DELHI: India delivered a sharp rebuke to Pakistan at the UN Security Council, condemning its ""grossly hypocritical"" stance on protecting civilians.While addressing UN Security Council, India's permanent representative to the UN, ambassador Parvathaneni Harish challenged Pakistan's credibility in discussing civilian protection, highlighting recent provocative actions by Pakistani forces.""We just recently saw senior government, police and military officials pay respects at the funeral of noted terrorists targeted by Operation Sindoor . A nation that makes no distinction between terrorists and civilians has no credentials to speak about protecting civilians,"" Harish said.He detailed recent attacks by the Pakistani army that resulted in over 20 civilian deaths and 80 injuries, with deliberate targeting of religious institutions including gurudwaras, temples, convents, and medical facilities.""To preach at this body after such behaviour is grossly hypocritical,"" Harish stated.India's representative recalled Pakistan's involvement in numerous terrorist attacks, including the 26/11 Mumbai attack and the recent killing of tourists in Pahalgam in April 2025. ""The victims of Pakistani terrorism have been predominantly civilians, since its objective has been to attack our prosperity, progress and morale,"" he noted.India on May 7 launched Operation Sindoor, which targeted nine terror-related sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir. This was in response to Pahalgam terror attack that claimed lives of 26 civilians. Pakistan retaliated with crossborder shelling and attempted drone attacks, prompting India to target key Pakistani military infrastructure, including the Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi and the Rahim Yar Khan airbase. The hostilities ceased on May 10 after both countries reached an understanding.Residents of border areas in Jammu and Kashmir faced severe destruction due to Pakistani shelling during the recent cross-border tensions. These border communities were the immediate victims when hostilities broke out between India and Pakistan, though the situation has now stabilised following a mutual ceasefire agreement. The Pakistani artillery fire inflicted substantial damage in the frontier villages, leaving numerous houses either completely destroyed or severely damaged, rendering them uninhabitable.Harish addressed broader concerns about civilian protection in armed conflicts, highlighting the emerging threats from terrorist entities using new technologies. He stressed that the international community must focus on developing national capabilities to protect civilians while maintaining zero tolerance for terrorism.""Respect for principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member States, should remain the basis for all actions taken by the Council for the protection of civilians,"" Harish stated, emphasising that politically motivated interventions in armed conflicts could have devastating consequences for civilian populations.Harish called for concrete actions to implement existing Security Council resolutions on civilian protection, emphasising that humanitarian operations must be guided by the core principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence.Residents of border areas in Jammu and Kashmir faced severe destruction due to Pakistani shelling during the recent cross-border tensions.

When Indian TV news made social media look sane,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-indian-tv-news-made-social-media-look-sane/articleshow/121372135.cms,"In times of war and other crises, people want news by the minute, but during Op Sindoor some Indian TV channels went overboard, at times running reports of deep strikes by Indian forces without verification, especially on May 8.Late evening, news anchors claimed Indian Navy had destroyed Karachi port, Indian Air Force had downed Pakistani jets, and their pilots had been captured, Pakistan’s PM had sought refuge in a bunker, and its army chief Asim Munir had been ousted in a coup. All of these claims eventually turned out to be false, and were picked up by major Western news organisations as a sign of decay in Indian TV journalism.The Economist has described the disinformation on TV as a “culmination of decades of descent into inanity,” adding that “Indian television achieved the astonishing feat of making social media appear sane.” The New York Times says, “anchors and commentators became cheerleaders for war between two nuclear-armed states. Some well-known TV networks aired unverified information or even fabricated stories amid the burst of nationalistic fervor. ”India had made it clear that Op Sindoor was a nonescalatory strike intended to take out terrorist infrastructure without harming Pakistan’s civilian and military installations.However, the belligerence of news channels suggested something else. “Indians watching television thought their country was only moments away from annihilating Pakistan,” NYT says.The Economist also took note of the commentary by panelists, “If news segments were merely outrageous, commentary was unhinged.” “One anchor demanded: ‘Set fire to Karachi, blow up the entire city.’ On another channel a former army officer called Iran’s foreign minister a ‘son of a pig’, triggering a minor diplomatic incident.” NYT points out that by pushing falsehoods, prominent news channels harm their audience and themselves: “When previously trusted sources become disinformation outlets, it’s a really large problem. ” In The Economist’s view, “Disinformation about drone swarms and mass suicide attacks was amplified rather than squashed. Border communities — which bore the brunt of blackouts and drone attacks — were left groping for facts. The rest of the country was less vulnerable to bombs, but not to lies.”But where TV news failed, newspapers remained true to their ethos of credibility. The Economist notes, “newspapers proved reliable” even though readers got their hands on them many hours after the “skirmishes” in the morning. That’s because the print media sticks to the old rule book of journalism and is also answerable for what it publishes. Every report is carefully fact-checked to safeguard credibility and reputation, built over decades and decades. Op Sindoor isn’t the first time newspapers have proven their credibility. Because processes of newsgathering and factchecking are sacrosanct. Seeing is believing, only if it’s in print.","During Op Sindoor some Indian TV channels went overboard, at times running reports of deep strikes by Indian forces without verification.

Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.Among the many couplets of Thirukkural on human connections, one stands out - friendships not swayed by emotions but steadied by clarity and enduring grace.The wise remain firm in friendships that neither blossom nor wither with time—unlike a flower that opens and closes its petals.Most of us know what it means to lose a friend; not with a dramatic rupture, but in the quiet drift of time. Bonds that once felt like lifelines slowly unravel. At times, life simply steers us in different directions. Sharp disagreements leave bruises. Or a shadow of a doubt — was something said behind one’s back— leads to a faltering of trust.I’ve had friends who were once the heartbeat of my days, now reduced to strangers. When we cross paths, it’s like walking through a museum of memories; echoes everywhere, but no one speaks. Some recollections are warm, others cut deep. The sting of betrayal resurfaces, uninvited. In those moments, I tell myself: You have to let people go. At some point, you see who truly mattered, who never did, and whose chapter in your story is simply over. They no longer belong to yours now.And yet, some friendships defy time, disagreement, and distance. Not because they are effortless, but because they are chosen, again and again, despite the friction.A shining example is that of Thiru V Kalyanasundaram (Thiru V Ka), the Tamil scholar and trade union pioneer. His friend and contemporary, M C Raja, was one of the earliest leaders of the Justice party. Both were reformers and thinkers, classmates and colleagues at Wesley College, and residents of Royapettah in Chennai.In 1921, the Binny Mill strike rattled the city. Thiru V Ka and Raja found themselves on opposing sides, not as enemies, but as leaders representing different groups of workers with diverging ideological paths.As tensions rose, whispers emerged that Thiru V Ka might be targeted, by police or angry factions. One day, a car halted at his door. Raja stepped out. “Trouble is on its way. Just get in,” he said.Thiru V Ka declined. But he never forgot the tears he saw in his friend’s eyes.Later, as the storm passed, Raja said something that stayed with him: Our friendship was strong enough to find harmony in the heart of conflict.Eventually, Raja moved to Alandur, and the rhythm of their friendship faltered.Another story, equally poignant, unfolded in 1933, again in Chennai. The newly formed Music Academy announced a dance performance by Rajalakshmi and Jeevarathnam—women from the devadasi community. The event was organised by E Krishna Iyer, then secretary of the Academy and a passionate cultural activist.At the time, Muthulakshmi Reddy was leading a fierce campaign to abolish the devadasi system, determined to restore dignity and civil rights to the women trapped within it. Krishna Iyer, while agreeing on the need for reform, argued that sadir—the classical dance form—should be preserved. To him, it was art, unjustly condemned by its social associations.The two began an intense public debate, exchanging letters through newspapers. Madras society split down the middle: some backed Reddy, others Krishna Iyer. Yet despite their differences, the two remained family friends, sharing stages, events, and mutual respect.In time, both found success. Reddy’s legislation helped abolish the devadasi system. Krishna Iyer, aided by Rukmini Devi Arundale, revived the art under a new name—Bharatanatyam—transforming it into a respected cultural treasure.Thiru V Ka and Raja. Krishna Iyer and Muthulakshmi Reddy. Four people divided by ideology, united by something deeper. Their friendships endured—not in the absence of disagreement, but because they held space for it. They lived what Thiruvalluvar wrote: relationships that neither bloom in prosperity nor wither in dissent.Not all of us are fortunate to have such enduring bonds. But perhaps the true test of friendship isn’t how brightly it blooms—but whether it survives when the petals fall.","Thirukkural with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text.

NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh on Friday advised Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to exercise caution in his remarks questioning the Centre and the armed forces over Operation Sindoor.Harivansh cited the example of Atal Bihari Vajpayee , who did not protest against former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi during the 1971 war with Pakistan.""There cannot be a more shocking, sad, and uninformative statement than this. This is the time when we all should stand together,"" Rajya Sabha deputy chairman said.""When the 1971 war took place, it was widely publicised that Atal Ji called Indira Ji 'Durga'. The reality was that Atal Ji did not say that, but he also did not protest at that time. Today, the situation is such that the whole country has to stand united... Pakistan's DGMO called our DGMO for a ceasefire. Pakistan's DGMO surrendered, and we are not ready to listen to our army. Former NSA Shivshankar Menon’s book mentions that after the Mumbai attack in 2008, where 166 people were killed, there was silence—whose government was in power then?"" he added.Harivansh also reminded Rahul that the UPA government allegedly hid the news of terrorists beheading a soldier near the Pakistan border, while then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was scheduled to meet US President Barack Obama.""Brahma Chellaney wrote in 2013 that terrorists beheaded our soldiers in the Keran sector near the Pakistan border. At that time, the Prime Minister was in America and was to meet then US President Obama. This news was hidden from the country,"" Harivansh said.""Do not go into the past, otherwise I will mention 2,500 incidents from 2004 to 2014. There were thousands of such occasions when you should have taken action, but did not,"" he added.This comes after Rahul Gandhi, in a social media post, claimed that India's foreign policy has collapsed under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and urged External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar to explain why India has been hyphenated with Pakistan, and who asked U.S. President Donald Trump to ""mediate"" between the two South Asian neighbours.This follows Rahul’s claim that the Centre informed Pakistan ""at the start"" of Operation Sindoor and stated that this was not a ""lapse"" but a ""crime.""On May 17, Rahul shared an undated video of Jaishankar in which the minister is heard saying that ""India had warned Pakistan before launching strikes"" on terror infrastructure.The MEA clarified that the government had warned Pakistan during the ""early phase after Operation Sindoor’s commencement,"" not before it began. It noted that Jaishankar had said, ""We had warned Pakistan at the start, which is clearly the early phase after Op Sindoor’s commencement.""""This is being falsely represented as a warning issued before the commencement. This utter misrepresentation of facts is being called out,"" the ministry added.Operation Sindoor was launched on May 7, targeting terror bases in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the deadly Pahalgam terror attack on April 22.","Harivansh cited the example of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who did not protest against former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi during the 1971 war with Pakistan.

CBI officer who exposed railway scam in 1993 shot with arrow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cbi-officer-who-exposed-scam-shot-with-arrow/articleshow/121370686.cms,"LUCKNOW: A Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officer in Lucknow's Hazratganj on Friday had to pay a hefty price for uncovering a railway scam in 1993 - when an iron-tipped traditional arrow pierced his chest in broad daylight.The incident occurred around 11:15am at the main gate of the CBI office located on Naval Kishore Road, Hazratganj - one of Lucknow's busiest areas.Eyewitnesses were stunned as a man emerged from behind a tree, aimed a wooden bow, and released an iron-tipped arrow directly at CBI ASI Virendra Singh, piercing his chest and knocking him to the ground.The accused, identified as Dinesh Murmu, a former railway employee from Khadagpur, Munger district in Bihar, was immediately overpowered by onlookers and handed over to police.Sources said that Murmu nursed a grudge for over three decades after losing his job in a 1993 CBI-led railway trap case that Singh helped investigate.Murmu is reportedly from a tribal community and worked as a junior employee in Indian Railways.After his dismissal, he returned to his village and largely lived off the grid. Preliminary questioning suggests that he spent months preparing for the attack and may have even practised using the weapon in isolated forested areas.According to police, the attacker used a handmade wooden bow and a sharpened metal arrow, reportedly crafted specifically for the assault. He waited behind a tree near the CBI gate, timing the attack for maximum impact as Singh stood momentarily alone. Singh was rushed to Lucknow's civil hospital with a 5cm wound to the left side of his chest.Chief medical superintendent Dr Rajesh Srivastava confirmed that Singh was in a stable condition and under continuous observation. ""If the arrow struck just slightly to the right, it could have pierced a major artery or even the heart,"" he said.CBI officers are also reviewing whether Singh received any threats in recent months, or if there were signs of surveillance prior to the attack.","A Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officer in Lucknow's Hazratganj had to pay a hefty price for uncovering a railway scam in 1993.

BHOPAL: A 24-year-old man, a listed criminal from the Kamla Nagar area, was allegedly murdered inside a hookah lounge near Nehru Nagar Square.His body was then stuffed into a carton and dumped into a stop dam at Veerpur village in Bilkisganj in Sehore. Kamla Nagar police had filed a missing person complaint in the matter two days ago.On Friday morning, Bilkisganj police recovered the body from the dam and informed Kamla Nagar police. Now, Kamla Nagar police is planning to register a murder case against the accused.The history-sheeter was killed reportedly over a comment he made on the accused's sister, a subject over which the accused and the victim had frequent confrontations in the past.The deceased was hit three times in the head with a frying pan at the lounge, following which he died.Police sources said that the deceased, identified as Lalu alias Arjun Yadav, 24, a resident of Shabri Nagar, went to the lounge to meet the prime suspect in the case on the intervening night of May 19 and 20, where an altercation led to his death. The prime suspect and his three to four friends attacked him with a frying pan and killed him on the spot, following which planned to get rid of the body..Following the confirmation of the murder, family members of the deceased staged a protest outside the Kamla Nagar police station on Friday morning, alleging police inaction.According to them, timely police intervention could have saved Lalu's life.Lalu Yadav, a resident of Shabri Nagar in Kamla Nagar, had a criminal history with more than two dozen cases registered against him on charges of rioting, assault, and attempted murder. He was allegedly involved in a prolonged dispute with the prime suspect, Shubham Nageshwar, who also resides in the same locality and runs a hookah lounge at Nehru Nagar Square. Shubham has no prior criminal record.Police sources said that on the intervening night of May 19-20, at around 12:30 am, Lalu reportedly called Shubham and went to meet him at the lounge. Shubham was there with his three to four friends, and they were planning to go to Salkanpur around 4 am.While Lalu arrived at the lounge intending to reconcile and end ongoing hostilities, he allegedly made an offensive remark about Shubham's sister. Enraged by this, Shubham reportedly picked up a frying pan from the lounge and struck Lalu on the head three times.The blows proved fatal.The group panicked after realising that Lalu has died. They kept his body at the lounge for a while before devising a plan to dispose of it.Lalu's family reported him missing on May 20. Aware of his criminal background, police allegedly assumed he went underground after committing a crime and would eventually return. But the family suspected Shubham and began collecting CCTV footage on their own.Police sources said that on May 21, police filed a missing person complaint based on Lalu's mother's complaint. Shubham and his friends fled from home. When police called them, they tried to mislead by saying they were in Goa while they were in Narsinghpur. Subsequently, police teams detained them, and they revealed the incident. The body was recovered based on their information.","Lalu Yadav, a listed criminal from the Kamla Nagar area, was allegedly murdered inside a hookah lounge near Nehru Nagar Square.

Runway lights weren't working as pilot tried to land at foggy San Diego airport before fatal crash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/runway-lights-werent-working-as-pilot-tried-to-land-at-foggy-san-diego-airport-before-fatal-crash/articleshow/121373129.cms,"Representative Image





SAN DIEGO: The runway lights were out, a weather alert system wasn't working and there was heavy fog at a San Diego airport when a pilot who had flown across the country made the decision to proceed with landing but came up short and crashed into a neighborhood, likely killing all six aboard the aircraft, investigators said Friday.Investigator Dan Baker of the National Transportation Safety Board said officials will work over the next year to determine what caused the Cessna 550 Citation to crash just before 4 a.m. Thursday. The jet was carrying a music executive and five others. No one in the neighborhood of U.S. Navy housing died, but eight people were treated for smoke inhalation from the fiery crash and non-life-threatening injuries.The pilot acknowledged the weather conditions for landing at the small airport were not ideal and debated diverting to a different airport while discussing the visibility with an air traffic controller at a regional Federal Aviation Administration control tower, according to audio of the conversation posted by LiveATC.net.The FAA had posted an official notice for pilots that the lights were out of service, but it's not known whether the pilot had checked it. He didn't discuss the lights being out with air traffic control, but was aware that the airport's weather alert system was inoperable. Ultimately, the pilot is heard saying that he'll stick with the plan to land at Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport.""Doesn't sound great but we'll give it a go,"" he told the air traffic controller.The plane crashed about 2 miles (3.22 kilometers) from the airport.Baker said a power surge knocked out the weather system at the airport but the pilot was aware of the fog and an air traffic controller gave him weather information from Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, about 4 miles (6.44 kilometers) north.Music talent agent Dave Shapiro, and two employees of the music agency he co-founded, Sound Talent Group, were among the dead along with the former drummer for metal band The Devil Wears Prada. Shapiro, 42, had a pilot's license and was listed as the owner of the plane.The two employees who died were Kendall Fortner, 24, and Emma Huke, 25, both Southern California natives and booking associates for the agency.The crash added to a long list of aviation disasters this year while federal officials have tried to reassure travelers that flying is the safest mode of transportation, which statistics support.Shapiro's aircraft took off from Teterboro, New Jersey, near Manhattan, at about 11:15 p.m. local time Wednesday and made a fuel stop in Wichita, Kansas, before continuing on to San Diego. He was returning to San Diego after a band he manages, Pierce The Veil, played for a sold-out audience at Madison Square Garden.That overnight schedule wouldn't be allowed for an airliner under federal crew rest rules, but those regulations don't apply to private planes.Assistant San Diego Fire Department Chief Dan Eddy said the fog was so thick in the morning that ""you could barely see in front of you.""Former NTSB and FAA crash investigator Jeff Guzzetti said he thinks dense fog and fatigue after the pilot flew all night long were likely factors in the crash.""This accident has all the earmarks of a classic attempt to approach an airport in really bad weather and poor visibility,"" Guzzetti said. ""And there were other airports that the crew could have gone to.""He said pilots are required to check FAA posts called Notices to Airmen that alert pilots to any issues such as runway lights being out.""It's fairly easy for the pilot to get that information and they are required to get that information before any flight they take,"" Guzzetti said.The pilot also would have likely noticed the lights weren't working as he descended. Without lights, procedure dictated that he should have climbed and diverted to another airport, Guzzetti said.Fragments of the plane were found under power lines that are about a half block from the homes. It went on to lose a wing on the road directly behind the homes. Guzzetti said even if the plane had missed the power lines it may have still crashed because it was coming in too low in the fog.A terrifying wakeup The crash site shows more damage on the front side of homes, including a smashed stone landscaping wall and an incinerated truck that was parked across the street and shoved into the living room of its owner's home before catching fire.Ben McCarty and his wife, who live in the home that was hit, said they felt heat all around them after being woken up by an explosion.""All I could see was fire. The roof of the house was still on fire. You could see the night sky from our living room,"" McCarty, who has served in the Navy for 13 years, told local ABC affiliate KGTV.Flames blocked many of the exits so they grabbed their children and dogs and ran out the back but the burning debris blocked the gate so neighbors helped them climb over the fence to escape.""We got the kids over the fence and then I jumped over the fence. They brought a ladder and we got the dogs,"" McCarty said.Meanwhile, fiery jet fuel rolled down the block igniting everything in its path from trees to plastic trash containers to car after car.McCarty's home was the only one destroyed, though another 10 residences suffered damage, authorities said.McCarty said his family used to enjoy living under the flight path so they could watch the planes pass overhead.""Us and our kids would sit on our front porch and we'd look up and my sons would always be excited saying 'plane plane' watching the planes go by and ironically right where we were sitting is where that plane hit,"" McCarty said.Now, he wants to move.""I'm not going to live over that flight line again - it's going to be hard to sleep at night,"" McCarty said.It could have been much worse Guzzetti said in his experience there often aren't deaths on the ground when a plane crashes in a residential area unless people are right where the plane hits such as in Philadelphia in January.At least 100 residents in the San Diego neighborhood were evacuated and officials said it was unclear when it would be safe for people to return.Thursday's crash comes only weeks after a small plane crashed into a neighborhood in Simi Valley northwest of Los Angeles, killing both people and a dog aboard the aircraft but leaving no one on the ground injured.In October 2021 a twin-engine plane plowed into a San Diego suburb, killing the pilot and a UPS delivery driver on the ground and burning homes.","The pilot acknowledged the weather conditions for landing at the small airport were not ideal.

BHOPAL: Three childhood friends were killed and a fourth critically injured when their speeding SUV slammed into a tree and then an electric pole in Khajuri on Bhopal-Indore Highway in the wee hours of Friday.The collision was so severe that the car nearly split in two. Three of the occupants - Pankaj Sisodia, 25, Preet Ahuja, 27, and Vishal Dabi, 25 - died on the spot, Khajuri SHO Neeraj Verma said. All of them were from Aara Machine Road in Bairagarh.The lone survivor, Rahul alias Kunal Kanade, 27, is in hospital where doctors have managed to stabilise his vital parameters, say officials.The SUV - which is now a mangled heap of metal - belongs to Preet's brother Kamlesh, who owns a garments shop in Bairagarh. Preet had taken the SUV without his brother's knowledge for a joy ride with his friends, say police.They drove to a dhaba in Sehore for dinner and were on their way back when the accident happened near a petrol pump, around 50km short of Bhopal. CCTV footage from a restaurant shows the SUV over-speeding and slamming headlong into a kiosk, then a tree and the pole around 2am.Police officials said two labourers were sleeping beside the kiosk and narrowly escaped the accident. There was no other vehicle or any stray animal seen during the accident, which suggests that the SUV driver lost control due to high speed, said an officer.Preet was driving the car. It was tough to extricate the bodies from the mangled and twisted metal.","Pankaj Sisodia, Preet Ahuja and Vishal Dabi died on the spot.

"White House slashing staff in major overhaul of National Security Council, officials say",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-house-slashing-staff-in-major-overhaul-of-national-security-council-officials-say/articleshow/121372427.cms,"US President Donald Trump (AP)





WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump is ordering a major overhaul of the national security council that will shrink its size, lead to the ouster of some political appointees and return many career government employees back to their home agencies, according to two US officials and one person familiar with the reorganization.The number of staff at the NSC is expected to be significantly reduced, according to the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive personnel matter.The shakeup is just the latest shoe to drop at the NSC, which is being dramatically made over after the ouster early this month of Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz, who in many ways had hewed to traditional Republican foreign policy.Secretary of state Marco Rubio has been serving as national security adviser since the ouster of Waltz, who was nominated to serve as Trump's ambassador to the United Nations.The move is expected to elevate the importance of the state department and pentagon in advising Trump on important foreign policy moves. But, ultimately, Trump relies on his own instincts above all else when making decisions.The NSC, created during the Truman administration, is an arm of the White House tasked with advising and assisting the president on national security and foreign policy and coordinating among various government agencies.Trump was frustrated in his first term by political appointees and advisers who he felt gummed up his ""America First"" agenda.There were roughly 395 people working at the NSC, including about 180 support staff, according to one official. About 90 to 95 of those being ousted are policy or subject matter experts seconded from other government agencies. They will be given an opportunity to return to their home agencies if they want.Many of the political appointees will also be given positions elsewhere in the administration, the official said.The NSC has been in a continual state of tumult during the early going of Trump's second go-around in the White House.Waltz was ousted weeks after Trump fired several NSC officials, just a day after the influential far-right activist Laura Loomer raised concerns directly to him about staff loyalty. Loomer has in the past has spread 9/11 conspiracy theories and promoted QAnon, an apocalyptic and convoluted conspiracy theory centered on the belief that Trump is fighting the ""deep state,"" and took credit for the ouster of the NSC officials that she argued were disloyal.And the White House, days into the administration, sidelined about 160 NSC aides, sending them home while the administration reviewed staffing and tried to align it with Trump's agenda. The aides were career government employees, commonly referred to as detailees.This latest shakeup amounts to a ""liquidation"" of NSC staffing with both career government detailees on assignment to the NSC being sent back to their home agencies and several political appointees being pushed out of their positions, according to the person familiar with the decision.A White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity confirmed that the overhaul, first reported by Axios, was underway but declined further comment.Waltz during his short tenure heading the NSC came under searing criticism in March after revelations that he added journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to a private text chain on an encrypted messaging app that was used to discuss planning for a sensitive military operation against Houthi militants in Yemen.Waltz has taken responsibility for building the text chain but has said he does not know how Goldberg ended up being included.Loomer had encouraged Trump to purge aides who she believes are insufficiently loyal to the ""Make America Great Again"" agenda.She also complained to sympathetic administration officials that Waltz was too reliant on ""neocons"" - shorthand for the more hawkish neoconservatives within the Republican Party - as well as what she perceived as ""not-MAGA-enough"" types, the person said.It wasn't just Loomer who viewed Waltz suspiciously. He was viewed with a measure of skepticism by some in the MAGA world who saw the former army Green Beret and three-term congressman as too tied to Washington's foreign policy establishment.On Russia, Waltz shared Trump's concerns about the high price tag of extensive US military aid to Ukraine. But Waltz also advocated for further diplomatically isolating President Vladimir Putin - a position that was out of step with Trump, who has viewed the Russian leader, at moments, with admiration for his cunning in dealings with Trump's predecessors.His more hawkish rhetoric on Iran and China, including US policy toward Taiwan, seemed increasingly out of step with Trump, who - setting aside belligerent rhetoric about taking over Greenland from Denmark - has tilted more toward military restraint and diplomacy in facing some of the United States' most challenging issues with adversaries.",The number of staff at the NSC is expected to be significantly reduced. About 90 to 95 of those being ousted are policy or subject matter experts seconded from other government agencies. Many of the political appointees will also be given positions elsewhere in the administration.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121372482,imgsize-644348,width-400,resizemode-4/121372482.jpg"

Criticism over delay in elections



Yunus vs army chief



Interim government undermining freedoms, says Human Rights Watch







B angladesh’s interim government head Muhammad Yunus has reportedly threatened to quit citing difficulties in carrying out his mandate due to the ongoing political stalemate.ANhid Islam, chief of the student-led National Citizen Party, told BBC Bangla that Yunus is growing increasingly uncertain about continuing in his role as chief adviser, as political parties have failed to reach consensus on key reforms.“Sir said - ‘If I can't work… I was brought here after a mass uprising to bring change and reform to the country. But in the current situation, with mounting pressure from movements and the way I'm being cornered ... I cannot work like this. The political parties, you've all failed to reach common ground’,” Islam quoted Yunus as saying.Bangladeshi newspaper Prothom Al reported that Yunus said in the meeting with his advisers that “what is the point of being the chief advisor if he cannot function properly?”Nobel Peace Laureate Yunus, 84, assumed leadership as the interim head of Bangladesh last August, following a student-led uprising that compelled then prime minister Sheikh Hasina to flee to India.Though there has been no official statement from Yunus’s office regarding the resignation, reports suggest growing tensions between the military and the interim government, particularly over the timeline for holding parliamentary elections. Political parties have increased pressure on Yunus to announce a clear election schedule.Yunus is facing mounting criticism from political parties and civil society groups over his failure to announce a timeline for the country's next parliamentary elections. Yunus, who took charge in August last year, had promised swift reforms and a return to democratic rule. However, nearly a year later, the absence of an election date has sparked accusations of indecisiveness and eroding public trust.“If the government fails to meet public expectations, it will be difficult for the BNP to continue extending its support,” senior BNP leader Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain said.“The highest priority should be placed on announcing a clear roadmap for the election,” he said.BNP has also been staging large-scale protests in Dhaka, demanding the immediate swearing-in of its mayoral candidate. The party claims that the interim government has obstructed an Election Commission ruling that declared Ishraque Hossain as the rightful winner of the disputed 2020 mayoral elections. At the time, the BNP had alleged that the polls were rigged by the now-banned Awami League.Amid calls for clarity, Yunus’s office has remained silent on a definitive election schedule.Bangladesh's army chief, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, has also reportedly issued a firm warning to Yunus, demanding that national elections be held by December. According to reports, while speaking at a closed-door meeting, Zaman also firmly rejected the Yunus government's proposed ""humanitarian corridor"" to Myanmar's Rakhine State, calling it a ""bloody corridor"" and a threat to national sovereignty.“The Bangladesh Army will never be involved in any activity that is harmful to sovereignty. Nor will anyone be allowed to do so,” Zaman was quoted as saying by the Dhaka Tribune.“National interest must come first in any action. Whatever is done must be guided by political consensus,” he said.The corridor plan, unilaterally announced in April by foreign adviser Touhid Hossain, was intended to route humanitarian aid through Chattogram Division, where over a million Rohingya refugees already reside. The plan, backed by the UN and reportedly supported by the United States, faced swift backlash from opposition parties, including the BNP and Left groups, who condemned it as “unilateral and illegal.”Meanwhile, a cabinet member and special adviser to Yunus said on Friday that Yunus ""needs to remain"" in office as interim leader to ensure a peaceful transition of power.""For the sake of Bangladesh and a peaceful democratic transition, Professor Yunus needs to remain in office,"" Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb, a special assistant to Yunus, and head of the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology, said in a post on Facebook.""The chief adviser is not going to step down,"" he said adding, ""He does not hanker after power.""Human Rights Watch has also put pressure on Yunus-led interim government by accusing it of undermining fundamental freedoms, citing its recent political crackdowns, including the banning of the former ruling party, the Awami League.The country, home to roughly 170 million people, has been in political unrest since a student-led uprising ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024. Protests have continued as various parties press for democratic reforms and swift elections.The organisation warned that Yunus’s administration risks repeating the authoritarian practices of his predecessor.“Instead of pursuing its pledge to reform the criminal justice system and bring accountability for serious abuses, the government… is attempting to suppress the rights of supporters of the deposed leader,” it said in a statement.The rights group condemned the government's use of “newly introduced powers under a draconian amendment to the Anti-Terrorism Act” to suppress opposition voices.The Awami League was officially banned on May 12, just days after mass protests outside Yunus’s residence. The ban remains in place pending trials of Sheikh Hasina and other senior party leaders, many of whom are accused of human rights violations during her tenure.As pressure mounts from political parties, military, and international rights groups, Muhammad Yunus now finds himself cornored from all sides. What was once seen as a moral and democratic reset under a Nobel laureate’s leadership is now mired a growing crisis of confidence. Now only time will tell whether Yunus will hold his ground or make an early exit.","Bangladesh's interim government head Muhammad Yunus has reportedly threatened to quit. Yunus is facing mounting criticism over his failure to announce a timeline for the country's next parliamentary elections. Reports suggest growing tensions between the military and the interim government, particularly over the timeline for holding parliamentary election.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121361260,imgsize-576953,width-400,resizemode-4/121361260.jpg"
North Korea vows to arrest those responsible for failed ship launch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-vows-to-arrest-those-responsible-for-failed-ship-launch/articleshow/121351142.cms,"Kim Jong Un (File Photo AP)





SEOUL: North Korea said Friday it began steps to arrest and investigate those responsible for the failed launch of its second naval destroyer after leader Kim Jong Un expressed fury over the incident that he said was caused by criminal negligence. The 5,000-ton-class warship was damaged when a transport cradle on the ship's stern detached early during a launch ceremony at the northeastern port of Chongjin on Wednesday, state media said. Satellite imagery on the site showed the vessel lying on its side, with most of its hull submerged and draped in blue covers.North Korea's official Korean central news agency said Friday that the severity of the damage was ""not serious"" and could be repaired in about 10 days. It said the hull on the starboard side was scratched and some seawater had flowed into the stern section, though it denied an earlier assessment that the bottom of the hull had been left with holes.The extremely secretive nature of North Korea makes it almost impossible to verify the assessment. North Korea has a history of manipulating or covering up military-related setbacks, policy fiascoes and other mishaps, though it has periodically acknowledged some of such events in recent years.Observers believe North Korea's admission of the failed launch was likely meant to show Kim's resolve to advance his naval capabilities and boost discipline.The North's central military commission summoned Hong Kil Ho, manager of the Chongjin shipyard, as it begun its investigation of the failed launch, KCNA reported.""No matter how good the state of the warship is, the fact that the accident is an unpardonable criminal act remains unchanged, and those responsible for it can never evade their responsibility for the crime,"" the commission said, according to KCNA.Kim, who was present at the failed launch, had blamed military officials, scientists and shipyard operators and ordered that the warship be repaired before a high-level ruling Workers' Party meeting in late June.The damaged ship is assessed as the same class as North Korea's first destroyer, unveiled last month with great fanfare and said to be capable of carrying various weapons including nuclear missiles. Analysts say it is the North's biggest and most advanced warship to date and was likely built with Russian assistance.The North Korea-focused 38 North website had assessed last week that North Korea was preparing to launch the destroyer in Chongjin with a method it has rarely used. The report said the ship was being prepared to be launched sideways from the quay, while the previous destroyer launched at the western shipyard of Nampo used a floating dry dock.","North Korea begins steps to arrest and investigate those responsible for the failed launch of its second naval destroyer.

Can US govt stop Harvard from enrolling international students?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/can-us-govt-stop-harvard-from-enrolling-international-students/articleshow/121371964.cms,"



The Trump administration wants to halt Harvard University from enrolling international students. Harvard on Friday sued the Trump administration for this, following which a federal judge blocked the administration from cutting off Harvard's enrollment of foreign students. But the big question is: how can the federal govt dictate which students a private university can and cannot enrol?The govt has enormous power over who comes into the US, and who doesn't. For college and universities, the Department of Homeland Security has a vast system just to manage and track the enrolment of the hundreds of thousands of international students studying across the country at any given time.But a school needs govt certification to use this database, known as SEVIS, for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. And this vulnerability is what the Trump administration is exploiting against Harvard.Homeland Security says, effective immediately, it has revoked a certification that allows Harvard to have access to SEVIS. Oddly enough, the students may still have valid visas. But Harvard is no longer able to log them into this all-important database.The announcement was a significant escalation in the administration's efforts to pressure Harvard to fall in line with the president's agenda.For each international student, Harvard inputs data into SEVIS to show that a student is enrolled full time, and thus meeting the terms of the visa that the student was issued.The system is overseen by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an arm of Homeland Security, which announced the termination Thursday.A t Harvard, more than a quarter of its total student body, or 6,800 students, come from other countries.The SEVIS termination for Harvard would mean that all foreign students at the school would be in limbo. The students would, en masse, become deportable immediately, unless they transferred to another school, or unless a court intervened to block the termination by Homeland Security. Students who took no action to enrol elsewhere would be violating the terms of their status and subject to removal.After graduating, international students have 60 days from the end of their programme to leave the US or adjust their immigration status, by obtaining a job, for example.Students who are returning to university programmes typically can remain in the country during summer breaks because they are still enrolled for the coming term.But if SEVIS is terminated for Harvard, it's unclear if students who would otherwise be returning would still be granted the summer grace period.The current spring term at Harvard ends Monday, according to the university's calendar.It does not appear that Homeland Security revoked the student visas of Harvard's international students. That means, in theory, they could leave or stay for the summer. They could go back to their home countries, potentially, and return to attend another school. Much of this is still unclear.","Homeland Security says, effective immediately, it has revoked a certification that allows Harvard to have access to SEVIS.

"TikToker with 1 million followers calls DC shooter a 'resistance fighter', calls victims 'war criminals'; video taken down",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tiktoker-with-1-million-followers-calls-dc-shooter-a-resistance-fighter-calls-victims-war-criminals-video-taken-down/articleshow/121369794.cms,"(Photo: X)





A teenage social-media influencer from Pennsylvania is under fire after telling his nearly one million followers to support the man accused of killing two Israeli Embassy staff in Washington, DC.The video was so inflammatory that TikTok removed it, reports the New York Post.Guy Christensen, a 19-year-old who goes by “YourFavoriteGuy” online, referred to the suspected gunman, Elias Rodriguez, as a “resistance fighter” in a video that quickly racked up over 630,000 views before being deleted by the platform. In the clip, Christensen said, “I want to urge you first to support Elias ’ actions.”The two victims, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, were shot and killed near the Capital Jewish Museum on Wednesday. US officials confirmed that both were employees of the Israeli Embassy.TikTok’s rare decision to take down Christensen’s video did not stop him from doubling down on his comments during a phone interview with The Post on Friday. “You will not hear me sympathise with war criminals,” he said, referring to the slain Israeli diplomats. “I do not condemn the elimination of those two Zionist officials who worked at the Israeli Embassy last night … and here’s why.”“Israel has live-streamed a genocide to the entire world the last two years,” Christensen said in the now-deleted video. A Palestinian flag waved in the background of the footage. He also called Lischinsky a “war criminal” and added, “And the same was true for the woman.”When asked if he was endorsing the killings, Christensen told The Post, “I think the only people who are interpreting [that] as such are the people who are using the slayings of those two Zionist officials … as a pretense to silence critics of Israel.”Christensen refused to disclose which university he attends. He has previously indicated on social media that he is from Pittsburgh.The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, reportedly shouted “Free Palestine” as he was arrested. “Free, free Palestine,” he chanted, according to Washington Police Chief Pamela Smith.US President Donald Trump said the killings were driven by antisemitism. “These horrible DC killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, now! Hatred and radicalism have no place in the USA,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Condolences to the families of the victims. So sad that such things as this can happen! God Bless You ALL!”Rodriguez remains in custody and is facing multiple charges in what officials have labelled a hate-driven attack. FBI Director Kash Patel said his team is closely involved.","Guy Christensen, a 19-year-old who goes by “YourFavoriteGuy” online, referred to the suspected gunman, Elias Rodriguez, as a “resistance fighter” The two victims, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, were shot and killed near the Capital Jewish Museum.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121370018,imgsize-733991,width-400,resizemode-4/121370018.jpg"

China, Canada, India are the top three home countries of Harvard's international students







Donald Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon said Harvard today is a disaster and he made sure that his words carry weight as he added that he can vouch for what he said as a Harvard graduate. ""Harvard just tweeted out on the official site 'Harvard without international students is not Harvard'.I don't think that in the 18th and 19th centuries, they were packed with foreign students when Harvard was at the top of its game.

South Korea and the United Kingdom have 264 students each studying at Harvard now. For undergraduate studies, the largest number of international students at Harvard is from Canada.China condemned the US ban on Harvard's international students and said this move will only damage US' image and international credibility.","Bannon said all those 6,000 billets should be filled with kids of American citizens, who are American citizens.

'Toms River is red and won’t stand...': NJ bar drops Bruce Springsteen cover band over anti-Trump rants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/toms-river-is-red-and-wont-stand-nj-bar-drops-bruce-springsteen-cover-band-over-anti-trump-rants/articleshow/121369504.cms,"NJ bar cancels Springsteen cover band over rocker’s anti-Trump comments





A Springsteen tribute band has been dropped from a Jersey Shore venue after the owner took issue with the singer’s public comments criticising US President Donald Trump , reports the New York Post.The nine-member cover band, No Surrender, was set to play at Riv’s Toms River Hub on May 30, but the show was cancelled after Bruce Springsteen made fresh anti-Trump comments during his tour in Europe.The cover band’s leader, Brad Hobicorn, said he began receiving “concerned texts” from bar owner Tony Rivoli soon after Springsteen’s fiery political rants went viral. The singer had branded Trump’s administration “corrupt, incompetent and treasonous” while performing in Manchester, England — part of his “Land of Hope and Dreams” tour.By Sunday, Hobicorn was informed the gig was off. Rivoli texted him to say the show was “too risky at the moment,” adding that his conservative customer base might not welcome a Springsteen-themed night.“Unfortunately it’s just too much money I wanted to do the Springsteen tribute for that money in my social media team would have promoted it we would have done well but now because Bruce can’t keep his mouth shut we’re screwed,” Rivoli wrote in one of the messages obtained by NJ Advance Media.Hobicorn even offered to switch the night’s setlist to classic rock instead of Springsteen songs, but Rivoli turned him down, saying he couldn’t justify paying $2,500 for a standard cover band.In another message sent to the band’s bassist, Guy Fleming, Rivoli wrote: “Whenever the national anthem plays, my bar stands and is in total silence, that’s our clientele. Toms River is red and won’t stand for his bull—.”Fleming later shared details of the situation on Facebook, prompting Rivoli to backtrack somewhat. He claimed the band could still perform and denied outright cancelling the gig. “As of (Wednesday), they could have played as No Surrender,” he said.“I think a lot of people of my base would not have came, but I could have been wrong. You know, who knows? You can’t predict what people are going to do.”But Hobicorn said the damage was done, and the band opted to play elsewhere. “At that point, there were negative vibes about the whole thing,” he explained. “There was definitely a safety concern,” he said.The show will now take place at Headliner Oasis in Neptune Township on the same date.“This is not political for us at all,” Hobicorn insisted. “We’re just a cover band that’s trying to make some money, and people rely on it financially. We’re the ones really getting hurt.”Riv’s isn’t new to controversy. Earlier this year, another Toms River venue, Aqua Blu Kitchen & Cocktails, apologised after naming a hamburger after the far-right Proud Boys group, drawing massive backlash.Meanwhile, Trump took another swipe at Springsteen last week, writing on Truth Social: “Never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he’s not a talented guy — Just a pushy, obnoxious JERK.”","No Surrender, a nine-member cover band, was set to play at Riv’s Toms River Hub on May 30.

Sindhudesh as an independent nation: JSMM demands UN recognition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/sindhudesh-as-an-independent-nation-jsmm-demands-un-recognition/articleshow/121359382.cms,".

The Sindhudesh Global Freedom Charter





The Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), a Sindhi nationalist group led by exiled chairman Shafi Burfat, has issued a renewed plea to the United Nations and other international communities, urging recognition of Sindhudesh as an independent nation and calling attention to what it describes as sustained political repression and human rights violations in Pakistan ’s Sindh province.In a comprehensive political manifesto titled, JSMM has approached the United Nations, international human rights bodies, democratic governments, and global civil society organizations, arguing that the Sindhi people are subject to a form of internal colonialism under Pakistan’s military and political establishment.In a direct appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian public, JSMM cited historical and cultural ties between Sindh and India, requesting moral and political solidarity. The group also called on international institutions to send human rights observers, document alleged violations, and engage with Sindh’s demand for peaceful self-determination.JSMM alleges that demographic engineering through state-sponsored resettlement has diluted Sindh’s ethnic composition, threatening the linguistic and cultural identity of the Sindhi people. Environmental degradation, particularly the diversion of the Indus river’s waters, has compounded local grievances, with widespread desertification of once-fertile lands cited as an ecological consequence of state policy.The statement firmly condemned Pakistan's security forces for committing serious human rights abuses in Sindh, including enforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings of political activists, journalists, and student leaders. It mentioned that anti-terrorism legislation is being misused to target secular and nationalist movements, whereas religious extremists receive support from the state.Positioning itself as a secular, democratic movement, JSMM has reiterated its vision for a sovereign Republic of Sindhudesh, grounded in principles of equality, minority protections, and social justice. The group invokes international law including the United Nations Charter and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to support Sindh’s right to self-determination.Long before modern borders were drawn, Sindh flourished as the heart of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation which was a sophisticated urban society that emerged over 5,000 years ago along the banks of the Indus river. With advanced city planning, intricate craftsmanship, and a vibrant mercantile culture, Sindh was once a beacon of early human progress. Mohenjo-daro, one of the civilisation’s most iconic sites, still stands as a testament to the region’s intellectual and architectural legacy. This deep-rooted historical identity is central to the Sindhi nationalist narrative, which views contemporary political struggles as a continuation of a civilisational arc interrupted by colonial conquests and post partition state formation.I n the colonial era, Sindh existed as a distinct administrative region under British India before being annexed, and eventually was re-established as a separate province in 1936. Advocates for Sindhi autonomy argue that this period fostered a unique political consciousness, one that emphasised cultural plurality and regional pride. The Partition of 1947, however, redrew not just boundaries but identities. Over subsequent decades, Sindhi activists have pointed to a pattern of political marginalisation and centralised control, arguing that their historical autonomy has been systematically pulled apart.Framing Sindh’s struggle as both civilizational and contemporary, the charter situated the region within the historical legacy of the Indus valley civilization, asserting that Sindh was forced into joining Pakistan in 1947 and has since faced cultural erasure and economic exploitation. The document claims that Sindh's resources including oil, gas, coal, fertile farmland, and deep-sea ports have been systematically extracted to benefit other regions, while the local population remains economically marginalized.While JSMM’s claims are politically charged and remain unacknowledged by the Pakistani state, the charter marks a significant step in internationalizing what has largely been a domestic conflict.","The Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), a Sindhi nationalist group led by exiled chairman Shafi Burfat, has issued a renewed plea to the United Nations and other international communities.

A promotion after defeat: What's behind Asim Munir's Field Marshal gambit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/field-marshal-asim-munir-pakistan-army-chief-operation-sindoor-india-and-pakistan/articleshow/121319156.cms,"Asim Munir’s grip on power may look firm, but it’s anything but secure.

Promotion or protection?

Officially, the move is being framed as a recognition of ""strategic brilliance."" PM Sharif praised Munir’s ""decisive defeat of the enemy,"" asserting that under his leadership, the military ""staunchly defended Pakistan’s sovereignty."" Munir himself called the promotion ""an honour for the armed forces and the nation.""

But few outside Pakistan’s tightly controlled media landscape are buying it.

""Field Marshal rank is usually conferred after a military victory,"" Tilak Devasher, a seasoned Pakistan watcher, told the Economic Times. ""This may be the first time it has been awarded after a defeat-it seems intended to mask that defeat.""

The timing is hard to ignore. Pakistan’s public is still reeling from the fallout of the India strikes, and internal dissent within the army is reportedly rising.

A widely circulated letter from a group calling itself ""The Guardians of Honour"" accused Munir of corruption and military incompetence. The letter reflects what some analysts say is quiet but growing discontent within senior ranks.

A shield against scrutiny

All ceremony, no strategy

The big picture: The war at home

Munir’s rise comes at a fragile moment for Pakistan. The ceasefire with India has held for now. But underneath the diplomatic calm lies a volatile domestic landscape:

Security turmoil: Over 3,700 terror incidents have claimed nearly 3,900 lives in the past 17 months, according to ISPR figures-pointing to a deteriorating internal security climate, especially in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

With rising inflation, IMF-dependency, and India's suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan's economy teeters on the edge. The military’s growing political role is being scrutinized for exacerbating the instability. Observers note that Munir is not merely defending national borders-he is navigating a labyrinth of domestic vulnerabilities that could unravel his authority.

His use of the two-nation theory and religious rhetoric to frame the India conflict was seen by critics as an attempt to rally the nation behind him. But the strategy may have backfired. ""Instead of unifying the nation, the gambit drew attention to Pakistan’s widening fractures,"" write analysts Ashok Behuria and Uttam Sinha in a joint commentary in the TOI.

The ghost of Imran Khan

What’s next

Munir’s elevation to Field Marshal is not about military strategy-it’s about political survival. It’s about shoring up a fractured command structure, muffling dissent, and projecting strength in the face of growing weakness.

Though the promotion may temporarily strengthen Munir’s position, it doesn’t erase the challenges ahead:

Internal threats persist, from Baloch separatists to the resurgent Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan.

PTI's political comeback looms, with Khan’s moral leverage growing even from prison.

Civil-military tension could intensify, especially if the rank is seen as an attempt to silence dissent or circumvent institutional checks.

There’s also talk of Munir eventually transitioning into a political role-possibly even as president. Ayub Khan set the precedent. In Pakistan’s fragile democracy, few would be surprised if history rhymed again.





In a move steeped more in symbolism than substance, Pakistan’s powerful army chief General Asim Munir has been elevated to the rarefied rank of Field Marshal . The announcement, made on Tuesday by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet, marks the first such promotion in over six decades. Only one other man-military dictator Ayub Khan in 1959-has held the title.But unlike Ayub, who awarded himself the rank amid consolidating his political power, Munir’s elevation comes on the heels of a military debacle. A bruising exchange with India, following a deadly attack in Pahalgam, resulted in India striking at least nine Pakistani air bases. The damage, while officially downplayed in Pakistan, left Munir politically exposed.So why the promotion? And why now?In a country where generals often enjoy impunity, the Field Marshal title may serve more as legal and political armor than as a mark of distinction. Some analysts see the promotion as a pre-emptive move to insulate Munir from possible court martial or early retirement, the ET report said.Legal experts point out that the Pakistani constitution makes no mention of the rank.Nor does the Pakistan Army Act. Instead, the promotion was reportedly made under Rule 199A of the Army Regulations (1998), which states that a general may be promoted to Field Marshal ""without regard to seniority or any specific appointment.""In essence, the move raises Munir above the military’s existing command structure-and, potentially, above accountability.Though technically ceremonial, the rank carries potent political meaning. In Pakistan’s civil-military power dynamic, optics often matter more than operational command.""Munir is now very much in the driving seat as the pivot of the power structure,"" said Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, former chair of the Senate defense committee. ""Given the weakness and divisions amongst the civilian politicians... all the mainstream political forces were convinced that the road to Islamabad lies through Rawalpindi.""That reality is reflected in the government’s simultaneous decision to extend the term of air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu-his second extension. Sidhu was credited with executing Operation Bunyanun Marsoos, Pakistan’s retaliatory air campaign against India's Operation Sindoor Still, in a tightly managed information environment, the military’s version of events prevails. State media declared a historic victory. Social media was flooded with hashtags like #PakistanStandsUnited. Meanwhile, dissenting voices-journalists, analysts, even former officers-vanished from screens.Munir’s political calculus also includes a rising challenge from behind bars: Former Prime Minister Imran Khan. His PTI party has labeled Munir a ""warmonger and coward,"" accusing him of dragging Pakistan into war to consolidate power. Khan’s moral authority, paradoxically strengthened by his imprisonment, continues to mobilize his base.Sharif’s civilian government, already seen as beholden to the military, risks further erosion of legitimacy. As one viral meme put it: ""War fought by Airforce. Army Chief promoted. Army’s only contribution-taking videos of tanks and hiding in bunkers.""(With inputs from agencies)","Pakistan's powerful army chief Asim Munir has been elevated to the rank of Field Marshal. The move is being framed as a recognition of ""strategic brilliance"" But critics accuse Munir of leveraging the Pahalgam terror incident to consolidate power.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121319353,imgsize-38182,width-400,resizemode-4/121319353.jpg"
Pakistan Supreme Court upholds death penalty in beheading case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-supreme-court-upholds-death-penalty-in-beheading-case/articleshow/121300483.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Tuesday upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer , convicted of the gruesome 2021 murder of Noor Mukadam, the 27-year-old daughter of a former Pakistani diplomat.The decision, delivered by a three-member bench led by Justice Hashim Kakar, reaffirmed the judiciary’s stance on a case that has gripped the nation and exposed deep-seated issues of gender violence and privilege in Pakistan’s elite circles. The ruling, however, also raises questions about the consistency of justice in a country where systemic inequalities often shield the powerful.The case, one of the most high-profile in Pakistan’s recent history, stems from the horrific events of July 20, 2021, when Noor Mukadam was found tortured and beheaded at Jaffer’s residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4.Jaffer, a Pakistani-American and son of a wealthy industrialist, was arrested at the scene, covered in blood. Investigations revealed that Mukadam, a childhood acquaintance, was held hostage for two days, tortured with a knuckleduster, raped, and ultimately decapitated after allegedly rejecting Jaffer’s marriage proposal. The brutality of the crime, coupled with the elite status of both the victim and the perpetrator, sparked nationwide outrage and reignited debates over violence against women in Pakistan.The apex court’s verdict dismissed Jaffer’s appeal, which claimed “erroneous appreciation” of evidence and questioned the fairness of the trial due to media influence. The court upheld the death penalty for murder but converted Jaffer’s second death sentence for rape to life imprisonment, citing legal considerations.“This is not just my daughter’s case; it is a case for all the daughters of Pakistan,” said Shaukat Mukadam, Noor’s father. The ruling has been hailed by many as a victory for accountability, with social media posts on X reflecting public relief: “I hope Noor’s parents will sleep a little better tonight,” wrote one user, while another called it a “win for humanity.” Yet, the decision also exposes uncomfortable truths about Pakistan’s legal and social landscape.Critics argue that the case’s prominence owes much to the victim’s elite background, highlighting a stark disparity in how justice is pursued. “Mukadam’s status as a diplomat’s daughter shone a spotlight on her murder,” said women’s rights activist Tahira Abdullah, noting that countless similar cases involving less privileged women rarely garner such attention or swift judicial action. Pakistan ranks 153 out of 156 countries in the World Economic Forum’s 2021 gender gap index, and domestic violence remains a pervasive issue, with 28% of women aged 15-49 reporting physical violence, according to the ministry of human rights.","The Supreme Court of Pakistan upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer.

Pakistan promotes army chief Munir to 5-star rank of Field Marshal for ‘crushing enemy’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-promotes-army-chief-munir-to-5-star-rank-of-field-marshal-for-crushing-enemy/articleshow/121300334.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: The Shehbaz Sharif govt in Pakistan promoted Tuesday army chief Syed Asim Munir from general to the five-star rank of Field Marshal in recognition of what it described as “exemplary leadership” while responding to India’s Operation Sindoor and bringing “great honour to our motherland”.For a country that has had four military rulers at different periods in its history, Field Marshal Munir is only the second Army chief to have been elevated to the apex rank, modelled on the British army’s structure. The first one, Field Marshal Ayub Khan, assumed the rank in 1959 while he was President, citing “requests” from Pakistani civil society.PM Shehbaz’s office announced that the cabinet unanimously decided to also continue the services of Air Chief Marshal Zahar Ahmed Babar Sidhu after his term ends.The statement also claimed that Pakistan downed five Indian jets and thwarted “further incursions”, leading to a US-mediated pause in military operations from May 10. Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media affairs wing, quoted Field Marshal Munir as dedicating the honour to “the nation, armed forces, and martyrs”.In a congratulatory statement on X, Shehbaz credited Field Marshal Munir with orchestrating a “high strategy” during the conflict with India, which escalated with the latter’s May 6-7 airstrikes targeting nine terrorist sites.Operation Sindoor was India’s response to 26 deaths in the April 22 terrorist attack on tourists in J&K’s Pahalgam.Without naming India, Shehbaz said that under Field Marshal Munir, the army “crushed the enemy’s nefarious designs”.With Pakistan’s history of military coups looming large, newly coronated Field Marshal Munir is widely seen as the kingmaker behind Shehbaz’s premiership. Critics of the move within Pakistan argue the promotion strengthens the military’s grip over civilian governance, especially amid domestic challenges like the Baloch insurgency and economic woes.The timing of the promotion, coinciding with Pakistan seeking US and EU’s support to counter “India’s terrorism narrative”, suggests a bid to project strength.While the PM's office and ISPR frame Field Marshal Munir’s elevation as a tribute to national resilience, its political undertones and opaque military claims raise concerns about democratic backsliding and regional instability.","Shehbaz Sharif govt in Pakistan promoted Tuesday army chief Syed Asim Munir from general to the five-star rank of Field Marshal.

A 4.7-magnitude earthquake hit Pakistan's Swat district and nearby regions on Sunday, according to ARY News.The quake struck at a depth of 205 kilometres, with its epicentre in the Hindukush mountain range — a known seismic zone spanning parts of Afghanistan and northern Pakistan.Tremors were felt across several areas of Swat, including Mingora and its outskirts. Authorities confirmed there were no immediate reports of damage.Earlier, on May 12, a 4.9-magnitude earthquake had shaken Quetta, the capital of Balochistan.The National Seismic Monitoring Centre (NSMC) confirmed that the 4.9-magnitude tremors affected Quetta and neighbouring regions. The quake's epicentre was situated west of Quetta, according to NSMC data.The tremor came just two days after Pakistan was hit by two consecutive earthquakes on Saturday — a 5.7-magnitude quake in the morning and a 4.0-magnitude tremor later in the day, according to Reuters.Pakistan's geographical position makes it particularly vulnerable to seismic activity, as it sits at the intersection of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. The country's territory is traversed by numerous significant fault lines, resulting in frequent and potentially damaging earthquakes.","A 4.7-magnitude earthquake hit Pakistan's Swat district and nearby regions on Sunday.

Row over Myanmar 'humanitarian corridor' sparks Yunus-army feud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/row-over-myanmar-humanitarian-corridor-sparks-yunus-army-feud/articleshow/121371974.cms,"Muhammad Yunus





DHAKA: A growing rift between Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus and the country's military leadership has burst into the open - exposing deep tensions over governance, national security and decision-making authority.At the heart of the dispute lies a proposal to facilitate a ""humanitarian corridor"" to Myanmar through Bangladesh, a move reportedly undertaken without the army's knowledge, prompting a forceful and unprecedented rebuke from the chief of army staff. A highly placed source told TOI that Yunus ""expressed his desire"" to step down on Thursday, as he was ""disturbed and frustrated"" by the controversy surrounding the issue.During an Officers' Address event in Dhaka Wednesday, army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman unequivocally rejected ""any notion of a corridor"", declaring it completely unacceptable without due political consultation. Gen Waker said such a decision should come from an elected govt and must follow due process, while emphasising that national interest must be prioritised and safeguarded. ""Whatever is done, it should be through political consensus,"" he said.Soon after Waker's remarks, Khalilur Rahman, the NSA and high representative to Yunus, categorically stated on the same day (Wednesday) that the govt had not discussed any corridor to Myanmar with any party and stressed that they do not intend to discuss it either. He clarified the govt was merely in talks with the UN about channelling aid - such as food and medicine - to Rakhine, in light of the humanitarian crisis there.Security analyst and president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies, Maj Gen (retd) ANM Muniruzzaman, however, argued that whether it's called a humanitarian corridor or relief delivery, the essence is the same. ""In this case, the national security adviser has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word 'corridor' has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine state,"" he said. ""...Let me be clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief.""""Disturbed and frustrated"" over these developments, Yunus on Thursday ""expressed his desire"" to step down, a highly placed source told TOI.Three prominent members of the July uprising - Mahfuj Alam, Asif Mahmud and National Citizen Party Convener Nahid Islam - met Yunus on Thursday at his official residence, apparently to convince him not to resign.After the meeting, Nahid told BBC Bangla that the chief adviser was ""considering"" resignation.

KATHMANDU: An earthquake of magnitude 4.3 hit Nepal in the early hours of Friday, as reported by the National Center of Seismology (NCS).The NCS provided the details in a post on X.According to the NCS, the earthquake occurred at 01:33 hours at a depth of 10 kilometres in Nepal.It took place at latitude 29.36 N and longitude 80.44 E.""EQ of M: 4.3, On: 23/05/2025 01:33:53 IST, Lat: 29.36 N, Long: 80.44 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Nepal.""https://x.com/NCS_Earthquake/status/1925646287371735313There were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage. Further details are awaited.Shallow earthquakes are more dangerous than deeper ones due to their greater energy release closer to the Earth's surface, causing stronger ground shaking and increased damage to structures and casualties, compared to deeper earthquakes, which lose energy as they travel to the surface.Nepal is highly earthquake-prone due to its location on a convergent boundary where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates collide. This collision generates immense pressure and stress, which is released as earthquakes. Nepal is also situated in a subduction zone where the Indian Plate is sliding beneath the Eurasian Plate, further increasing stress and strain.Nepal lies in the Himalayan region, a zone of intense seismic activity caused by the ongoing collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates.This collision results in the Indian plate pushing beneath the Eurasian plate in a process called subduction, creating immense pressure and strain on the Earth's crust.The subduction zone further amplifies the stress, making Nepal highly vulnerable to earthquakes. The collision also contributes to the uplift of the Himalayan mountains, adding to the overall seismic activity in the region.Nepal has a long history of earthquakes, including devastating events like the 2015 earthquake.Earlier on April 26, a minute's silence was observed for 8,969 victims who lost their lives on April 25 2015, in the devastating earthquake of 7.8 Richter scale a decade ago.Standing below the replica of Dharahara Tower that fell down during the earthquake a decade ago, killing dozens, Nepali Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli remembered those killed in the natural disaster.",An earthquake of magnitude 4.3 hit Nepal in the early hours of Friday.

Professor Muhammad Yunus , the head of Bangladesh's interim government, is considering stepping down from his position, as per several media reports. Yunus feels it is becoming difficult to continue in his role because the political parties have not reached a mutual understanding, according to a report by BBC Bangla.The BBC Bangla service reported this at midnight on Thursday, quoting Nhid Islam, leader of the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP). Islam said, ""We have been hearing news of sir's (Yunus) resignation since this morning. So I went to meet sir to discuss that issue . . . He said he is thinking about it. He feels that the situation is such that he cannot work.""Nahid Islam, leader of the National Citizen Party (NCP)-- made up of many of the students who spearheaded the uprising against Hasina last year-- met with Yunus on Thursday evening, news agency AFP reported.Islam, who is the convenor of the NCP and closely linked with Yunus since February, said Yunus shared his concern about continuing in the current environment. ""I won't be able to work unless the political parties can reach a common ground,"" Yunus, chief adviser of the interim government of Bangladesh, reportedly said.Islam said he encouraged Yunus to stay in his role, saying it was important for the country’s stability and future.He told the BBC, ""I told him to stay strong for the sake of the country's security, and future and to meet the expectations of the mass uprising.""He added that he hoped political parties would eventually cooperate with Yunus. ""I hope everyone will cooperate with him,"" he said.At the same time, Islam said that if Yunus feels he cannot do his job properly, leaving the post might be the right decision. ""If the political party wants him to resign now . . . why he will stay if he does not get that place of trust, that place of assurance?""Muhammad Yunus, the 84-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate and current chief advisor of the caretaker government, informed his cabinet that he was considering stepping down unless he received full backing from political parties, according to a source from his office.""He wanted to tender his resignation, but his cabinet members persuaded him not to,"" a source was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP.Muhammad Yunus’s reported indication that he may resign comes a day after thousands of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) supporters staged a major protest in Dhaka—their first large-scale demonstration against the interim government.Yunus has said that elections would be held by June 2026 at the latest. However, BNP supporters, widely viewed as strong contenders in the next polls following Hasina's ouster, demanded a fixed election date.""If the government fails to meet public expectations, it will be difficult for the BNP to continue extending its support,"" senior BNP leader Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain told reporters on Thursday.He added, ""The highest priority should be placed on announcing a clear roadmap for the election.""The BNP also called for the removal of two cabinet members, alleging they are aligned with the National Citizen Party (NCP), and also demanded the dismissal of the national security advisor.""Their presence in the council of advisers raises questions about the nonpartisan and impartial nature of the government,"" Hossain said.""It seems the government is pushing forward the agenda of a particular group.""Meanwhile, Yunus’s ties with the military have reportedly worsened., which had played a major role during last year’s student protest movement. That movement had led to the removal of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and brought Yunus into power.On Wednesday, reports said that army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman called for elections to be held by December.""Bangladesh is going through a difficult time,"" local newspapers quoted him as saying.""The situation is getting worse every day.

What is the Kneecap controversy? Pro-Palestine Band charged with terror offences,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/what-is-the-kneecap-controversy-pro-palestine-band-charged-with-terror-offences/articleshow/121360089.cms,"What is Kneecap?



How the Kneecap controversy started?



Terror charge and legal proceedings

Political activism and support for Palestine

Rise to global fame through film

Controversial performances and symbolism



Footage and investigations

Public apology and Band response

Cancelled shows and political reaction





Kneecap, an Irish Band, hailed as cultural disruptors by supporters and branded dangerous extremists by critics, has been thrust into the global spotlight after one of its members was charged with a terror offence in the United Kingdom. Liam Og O hAnnaidh, known on stage as Mo Chara, faces charges related to allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag during a performance in London. This legal development follows a series of controversies involving the band’s outspoken support for the Palestinian cause, provocative performances, and incendiary lyrics that have drawn fierce political and media backlash. The trio’s actions have prompted investigations, concert cancellations, and calls for bans, all while igniting intense debates about the limits of artistic freedom, political expression, and national security.Formed in 2017, Kneecap is a politically charged rap trio from west Belfast, composed of Mo Chara (Liam Og O hAnnaidh), Moglai Bap (Naoise O Caireallain), and DJ Provai (JJ O Dochartaigh). Known for their fusion of Irish and English lyrics, the group embraces themes of resistance, identity, and satire, often courting controversy through provocative imagery and performances. All three members are fluent Irish speakers, and their music is seen as both a celebration and a defence of the Irish language.Their debut single, “CEARTA,” released during a campaign for Irish language rights in Northern Ireland, set the tone for their defiant public persona.The controversy escalated when London’s Metropolitan Police confirmed that Mo Chara had been charged with a terror offence under UK law. The charge stems from a performance on 21 November 2024, during which video footage appeared to show him displaying a Hezbollah flag and shouting slogans allegedly in support of proscribed terrorist groups. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are designated terrorist organisations in the UK, and it is illegal to publicly express support for them. Mo Chara is due to appear before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on 18 June. The UK’s Counter Terrorism Command was reportedly alerted to the video in April 2025, leading to the charge after consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service.On 21 May 2025, UK authorities officially charged Mo Chara (under the legal name Liam O’Hanna) with a terror offence. The charge relates to the alleged display of a Hezbollah flag during a concert at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town in November 2023. The Crown Prosecution Service authorised the charge following an investigation prompted by an online video. Mo Chara is scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on 18 June.Kneecap’s strong pro-Palestinian stance has become a focal point of international attention. During their set at the Coachella festival in April 2025, the band displayed on-screen messages condemning Israel for genocide and accusing the United States of enabling war crimes. One message read: “F*** Israel. Free Palestine.” These statements triggered significant backlash from US commentators, including Sharon Osbourne, who called for their US work visas to be revoked and likened the group to a “Hamas fan club. ” The band’s manager later revealed they had received serious death threats as a result of their comments.Kneecap’s influence expanded rapidly following the release of their semi-fictionalised film in 2024, which starred Oscar-nominated actor Michael Fassbender. The film was both a critical and commercial success, earning six BAFTA nominations and winning for Outstanding Debut. It also secured four awards from the Irish Film and Television Academy, including Best Director for Rich Peppiatt. The film depicted the band’s origins, blending humour, music, and social commentary, and was praised by international outlets like The Independent, which called it “a sweary, crude, and brilliantly political Irish comedy. ”Throughout their career, Kneecap has attracted criticism for what some view as the glamorisation of drug use and militant Irish republicanism. They have worn balaclavas in the colours of the Irish flag during performances and sparked outrage by commissioning a mural in Belfast of a burning police Land Rover, seen by opponents as glorifying terrorism. Their lyrics and public appearances frequently contain anti-British sentiment, including a song titled “Get Your Brits Out” and chants calling for British withdrawal from Northern Ireland.Following Coachella, old videos resurfaced of Kneecap performances in London, allegedly showing Mo Chara displaying a Hezbollah flag and shouting slogans such as “Up Hamas, up Hezbollah.” Another clip included the statement: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.” These incidents led to a criminal investigation by London’s Metropolitan Police, involving counter-terrorism officers. As both Hamas and Hezbollah are proscribed as terrorist organisations in the UK, expressions of support for them are criminal offences.Amid growing backlash, Kneecap issued an apology to the families of murdered British MPs Jo Cox and David Amess, stating they never intended to incite violence and expressed regret for any pain caused. The group reaffirmed their message of “love, inclusion, and hope” and rejected claims of promoting terrorism. They also alleged they were the target of a “coordinated smear campaign,” particularly from the United States, and announced plans to pursue legal action against what they described as malicious misinformation.As the controversy intensified, several of Kneecap’s scheduled concerts in the UK and Germany were cancelled. The British government urged Glastonbury organisers to reconsider the band’s participation in the upcoming festival. Politicians, including UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, called for Kneecap to be banned entirely from performing. In contrast, a group of artists including Pulp, Annie Mac, Massive Attack, Paul Weller, and Primal Scream signed an open letter in support of the band’s right to political expression.The Kneecap controversy has become a flashpoint in debates over free speech, artistic freedom, and the boundaries of political activism in music. While their supporters view the band as fearless truth-tellers and cultural revolutionaries, critics argue that their methods flirt with extremism and incite division. As legal proceedings continue, the world will be watching to see how the justice system, the music industry, and public discourse respond to a band that has consistently refused to play by the rules.","Liam Og O hAnnaidh, known on stage as Mo Chara, faces charges related to allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag during a performance in London.
