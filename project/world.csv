Lucknow Doctor Tasked By JeM To Form Women’s Terror Wing In India, Police Link To Delhi Blast Probe

NEW DELHI: Dr Umar Un Nabi, who has emerged as the prime suspect behind Monday's suspected car blast near Red Fort, was the most radicalised member of the Faridabad module, which included the arrested Dr Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, Dr Adeel Majeed Rather, and Dr Shaheen Shahid, sources connected with the investigation said on Tuesday.Shaheen, during her interrogation in Srinagar on Monday night, conceded that Umar would passionately speak of ""unleashing multiple terror attacks in the country"" every time they met after work at the Al-Falah Medical College. Sources told TOI he, along with Muzammil and Adeel, had been amassing fertiliser-based explosives like ammonium nitrate for almost two years, purportedly for use in pan-India terror attacks on behalf of terror outfit Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM).Muzammil, Adeel and Shaheen were earlier arrested by J&K police in coordinated action with UP police and Haryana police. Umar, who was teaching at Al-Falah Medical College in Faridabad, however, managed to slip away and is believed to have gone underground, only to resurface as a suspected car bomber. He is suspected to have packed an i20 car with commercially available explosives like ammonium nitrate and detonators.Questioning of the arrested doctors in J&K points to a wider Jaish network. Shaheen revealed that her brother, Parvez Sayeed, was also radicalised and part of the same chat group as Muzammil and Adeel. A J&K police team on Tuesday visited Lucknow and picked up Parvez but could not make any significant recoveries. ""It is possible that he got rid of the explosives, anticipating arrest,"" said an officer. A Gurugram-based ammonium nitrate supplier has also been identified and may soon face raids and arrest.Source said the raids in Faridabad and the Delhi blast have exposed a network of clerics engaged in indoctrination, including a Shopian-based maulvi, Irfan Ahmad Wagay, who was directly in touch with Pakistan-based Jaish handler Umar bin Khattab, alias Harjulla. Another cleric, Mewat-based Hafiz Mohd Ishtiyak, was providing logistics to the terrorists. These clerics were using social media platforms to radicalise highly qualified professionals like doctors for carrying out pan-India terror attacks on behalf of JeM. ""Medicine being a noble profession offered the doctors a perfect cover for their conspiratorial agenda,"" an officer noted.This is not the first time that a Kashmiri doctor has been found engaged in terror activities. In Nov 2023, J&K LG Manoj Sinha had dismissed Dr Nisar Ul Hassan, assistant professor (medicine) at SMHS Hospital, Srinagar, over terror links. Hassan was a self-styled president of DAK, which was supposedly used by him as a cover to orient medical professionals in J&K towards secessionism, under the patronage of Pakistani proxies.""It is a matter of investigation if Hassan had any role in radicalising the Kashmiri doctors arrested in Faridabad or involved in the Delhi blast,"" said an officer.","Dr Umar Un Nabi has emerged as the prime suspect behind Monday's suspected car blast near Red Fort.

‘Never Heard Such an Explosion’: Locals Recall Shock and Panic After Delhi Blast

'Blast was carried out in panic by Jaish member'





NEW DELHI: Confirming that Monday's blast near Red Fort was a terror attack, Delhi Police has filed an FIR under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The initial intel assessment is that the blast was set off by a Jaish-e-Muhammed module wanting to avenge the damage inflicted on the Bahawalpur HQ of the outfit during Operation Sindoor.As reported by TOI on Tuesday, Umar Un Nabi, a member of the ""doctor module"" who had escaped during raids by J&K police, has been confirmed as the man present in the car who carried out the 'lone wolf fidayeen attack'.The initial investigation indicates that the handlers were based in Turkiye and Nangarhar in Afghanistan. They were in touch with Umar and other members of the module.Sleuths suspect that Umar panicked after the arrest of his associate and the main accused in the Faridabad module, Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie, and hit the road with the car with explosives to escape arrest. He was on the move continuously suspecting that the cops were on his trail.Some investigators believe that Umar may have tried to dispose of or hide the explosives or the car. Having failed to do so, he set off the blast.But there is largely a consensus that the blast was carried out with proper planning and the detonation may not have been accidental. ""More corroborative evidence is needed to arrive at a conclusion. The probe is at an early stage,"" said an officer.Though Umar has been described as the bomber who died in the attack, a DNA match will fully confirm his identity, cops said. Only an arm, supposedly his, was found near the vehicle. Sources said Tuesday that he was probably the lone occupant of the car at the time of the blast. A CCTV has captured him at one spot sitting alone in it.The official blast toll stands at nine. There are two-three body parts which have not been linked yet and a DNA analysis will establish if they were of different people. In that case, the toll may reach 12.The Delhi blast was carried out in panic and desperation by a member of a Jaish module after raids by alert security agencies successfully busted its hideouts and bases across J&K, Haryana and UP, according to sources in the security establishment.""Raids by security agencies across multiple locations in Delhi-NCR and Pulwama, which led to the recovery of nearly 3,000kg of explosives, are believed to have forced the suspect to act hastily under mounting pressure,"" a senior officer of the central security establishment told TOI.Sources said the haste was confirmed by the fact that the bomb used for the blast was loosely assembled and not fully developed, thus limiting the impact. The explosion did not create a crater and no shrapnel or projectiles were found.""Dr Umar, a member of the module, changed his location from Al Falah Medical College campus following the crackdown on other members of his module. He is the one who was driving the car used in the blast, as corroborated by CCTV footage. The blast was caused by the very same explosives that were found in Faridabad hideouts,"" said an officer.""Whether this blast was premeditated or accidental is a matter of investigation,"" the officer added. Sources said a few factors, however, pointed to an unintended explosion, including the fact that the vehicle was moving amid traffic and was not driven into a crowd, a common strategy used in vehicle-borne IED attacks to maximise casualty. The possibility of the explosives getting activated while being transported from point A to B is also not being ruled out.While describing the loss of deaths as tragic, officials said a major strike could not be carried out because of the alertness shown by cops in taking cognisance of the Jaish posters in J&K and the subsequent efforts of intelligence and police forces.The officer said demolition of the Jaish module responsible for the Delhi blast displayed the country's alertness levels against terror. ""This is a success of our intelligence agencies, security apparatus and law enforcement officers,"" the officer added.As reported by TOI on Monday, the origins of the Jaish module case investigation lay in a few objectionable posters that had come up in Srinagar. An FIR was registered in the case on Oct 19.",Delhi Police has filed an FIR under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Initial intel assessment is that the blast was set off by a Jaish-e-Muhammed module wanting to avenge the damage inflicted on the Bahawalpur HQ of the outfit during Operation Sindoor.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125259870,imgsize-1206397,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-86.jpg"

Doctor’s Car Leads To Chilling Terror Trail, Face Of Suspect Revealed

NEW DELHI: Initial investigations into the car explosion near Delhi’s Red Fort suggest that the blast was not a typical suicide attack, but may have been triggered prematurely in panic by the suspect, news agency ANI reported citing sources.According to the sources, the suspect did not follow the usual pattern of a suicide car bombing — he neither rammed the vehicle into a target nor appeared to aim for maximum casualties. “The blast near the Red Fort did not follow the typical modus operandi of suicide bombers, who generally seek to inflict large-scale damage,” they said.The improvised explosive device (IED) was likely premature and underdeveloped, as the explosion created no crater and no shrapnel or projectiles were recovered from the site. The car was still moving when the device detonated, indicating that it was not designed for a high-impact collision.Investigators also believe the suspect may have acted hastily under pressure, as security agencies have been conducting nationwide raids on terror-linked networks. Significant quantities of explosives have been recovered from Faridabad, Saharanpur, Pulwama, and other locations, officials said.The explosion, which ripped through a slow-moving Hyundai i20 near the Subhash Marg traffic signal by the Mughal-era monument on Monday evening, killed at least eight people and left several others injured. If confirmed as a terror attack, it would mark the first such incident in Delhi since 2011.Meanwhile, the Centre on Tuesday handed over the investigation to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), with Union Home Minister Amit Shah directing the agency to submit its report at the earliest. Shah also instructed the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to examine and match all material samples collected from the site and deliver a comprehensive report without delay. Chairing a high-level security review meeting at his residence, Shah directed agencies to leave no angle unexplored and to “hunt down each and every culprit” behind the incident.“Chaired review meetings on the Delhi car blast with senior officials. Instructed them to hunt down each and every culprit behind this incident. Everyone involved in this act will face the full wrath of our agencies,” Shah posted on X (formerly Twitter).The meeting was attended by senior officials including Union home secretary Govind Mohan, Intelligence Bureau Director Tapan Deka, NIA Director General Sadanand Vasant Date, and Delhi Police Commissioner Satish Golchha.The NIA is expected to conduct a comprehensive probe into the nature of the explosives, the suspect’s identity, and possible links to terror outfits, as authorities work to piece together the sequence leading to the blast.","Initial investigations into the car explosion near Delhi’s Red Fort suggest that the blast was not a typical suicide attack.

The Pulwama link

NEW DELHI: A woman doctor from Uttar Pradesh has emerged as a key suspect in a widening terror investigation that began with what officials describe as a ""white-collar"" terror network spanning multiple states and intensified by Monday's deadly car blast near Delhi's Red Fort.According to investigators, Dr Shaheen Sayeed, associated with Al Falah University in Faridabad, was allegedly tasked with setting up the women’s recruitment wing of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in India. The wing, called Jamaat-ul-Mominat, was meant to attract educated women and professionals into the group's network, news agency PTI reported quoting sources.Shaheen was among eight people, including three doctors, arrested after agencies busted an interstate terror module operating across Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, seizing nearly 2,900 kg of explosives, including ammonium nitrate.The arrests came just hours before the Red Fort blast, which killed at least 12 people and injured 20 others on Monday evening. Investigators now believe the blast and the module are linked.Officials said the nature of the blast indicates a well-coordinated operation and that the role of JeM and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind operatives in organising a professional, educated terror network is being closely examined.""This was a white-collar terror setup — with doctors and educated youth being radicalised for logistical and operational roles,"" an intelligence officer told PTI.Preliminary findings in the Red Fort blast have found that Dr Umar Nabi, a medical professional from Lethpora in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district, was driving the Hyundai i20 that exploded near a traffic signal outside Red Fort. Nabi, also connected to Al Falah University, is believed to have died in the blast.Officials suspect that Umar carried out the explosion after learning that several of his associates — including Shaheen — had been detained. Police sources said the vehicle contained ammonium nitrate, fuel oil, and detonators, and a suicide attack has not been ruled out.Delhi Police Commissioner Satish Golcha confirmed that multiple agencies, including the NIA and the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), are probing the incident. The Home Minister has been briefed regularly, he said.Jammu and Kashmir Police have taken DNA samples from Umar’s mother to match with remains recovered from the blast site. Investigators have also arrested Tariq, another Pulwama resident who allegedly provided the car used in the attack.Teams from Delhi Police, NIA and intelligence agencies have fanned out across Delhi, Kashmir and Haryana, detaining at least four more individuals for questioning.

BENGALURU: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar's scheduled visit to New Delhi on Saturday (Nov 15) has reignited speculation over Congress's reported CM seat-sharing pact and an impending cabinet reshuffle, reports BV Shivashankar.While Siddaramaiah is said to be pushing for a rejig to consolidate his hold on govt, the Shivakumar camp is reportedly working to block the move, viewing it as an attempt to delay the reported transition of power between the two stalwarts. Sources say Siddaramaiah's camp has called a luncheon meeting in Delhi Saturday to chalk out reshuffle strategy.In a parallel move, Siddaramaiah's supporters are planning an OBC convention on Nov 19 to mark 50 years of the Justice LG Havanur Commission report. It is being seen as a show of strength to reaffirm his leadership among backward classes. ""We hope there won't be a change of guard. Siddaramaiah is a tall leader representing backward classes,"" said KM Ramachandrappa, president, Federation of Backward Classes.But an MLA from the Shivakumar camp said: ""We will do everything we can to ensure a smooth transition. Shivakumar is moving heaven and earth to stall it (cabinet reshuffle).""""I'm going to Delhi on Nov 15 to participate in an event organised by senior functionary Kapil Sibal. I expect to return the same day. I will meet the high command provided I'm given time. The cabinet reshuffle will be done after meeting Rahul Gandhi,"" Siddaramaiah told reporters in Mysuru.He is reportedly planning to drop 20 ministers - many of whom have served multiple terms - and induct new faces into his 34-member cabinet.

CHANDIGARH: A ""victim's absolutely normal mental state"" after an alleged Pocso case offence raises serious doubts about the credibility of allegations, Punjab and Haryana High Court said in a recent order while suspending the five-year sentence of a teacher convicted of molesting a student.HC noted the Class VIII student attended a PTM with her parents the day after the alleged offence, took photographs at school, and posted them on Instagram with the caption ""School Mein Maje"".""Such behaviour cannot reasonably be anticipated from a minor who was subjected to sexual molestation by her teacher at school merely a day prior,"" Justice Namit Kumar said in the order, passed on a petition by the teacher.On Nov 8, 2024, a fast-track special court in Chandigarh convicted the teacher in a Pocso case registered on Nov 2, 2022, awarding the maximum sentence of five years. His appeal against conviction was admitted by High Court in Nov last year.The prosecution alleged the teacher called the student, engaged in obscene talk and touched her inappropriately on Nov 2, 2022. Out of fear, she left school but narrated the offence to her father after arriving home.The teacher, on the other hand, claimed the girl harboured a grudge against him as he had caught her in a ""compromising position"" with a boy and reprimanded her around a month earlier.""The teacher had only called the girl to the staff room to question her over the use of a mobile phone during school hours, instructing her to bring her parents and the phone the next day for the PTM,"" his counsel said.The bench observed the mental state of the survivor remained ""absolutely normal"" even after the alleged offence, casting serious doubt on the veracity of her allegations and indicating the offence did not take place. HC said any child who experienced such an incident must have been mentally traumatised for a while.""The conduct and demeanour of the prosecutrix subsequent to the alleged incident does not inspire confidence in the prosecution version, and the behaviour of the prosecutrix exhibits no sign of fear, trauma, and emotional distress that would ordinarily be expected from a victim of such a grave offence,"" High Court said. The sentence shall remain suspended till the appeal against conviction is decided.","Punjab and Haryana High Court suspended the five-year sentence of a teacher convicted of molesting a student.

CCTV footage is being checked to track Muzammil’s movements.

Cops launch massive search, combing operations at univ and nearby areas

FARIDABAD: The identification of Umar Un Nabi as the driver of the i20 car that exploded in Delhi on Monday evening - killing nine persons - has established a direct link to the network of radicalised doctors that has been unravelling over the past few weeks in J&K, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.All roads in the blast investigation now lead to Al-Falah University in Faridabad, where Nabi and two others allegedly involved in the plot - Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie and Shaheen Shahid - were colleagues, doctors who taught MBBS programmes. Apart from them, police are also probing the role of Mohd Istaq, a cleric at a mosque on the university campus.The investigation began to take shape when Muzammil was arrested by a team of J&K police on Oct 30. Muzammil (35) managed the emergency wing of the university hospital and had been teaching MBBS students at Al-Falah for over three years now. Following his arrest, police recovered nearly 2,900kg of explosive and flammable substances, a Krinkov assault rifle with three magazines, 83 live cartridges, a pistol with eight live rounds, two empty cartridges, two additional magazines, 12 suitcases and a bucket filled with explosive material, 20 timers, four batteries, remotes and a walkie-talkie set from two rooms he had taken on rent recently.While Muzammil stayed on the Al-Falah campus, the explosives were found in two villages - Dauj and Dehar Colony in Fatehpur Taga - both located near the university.The plot thickened when police discovered that Muzammil was using a Swift Dzire registered in the name of Shaheen. According to investigators, Shaheen - a doctor from Lucknow and purported girlfriend of Muzammil - also taught MBBS students at Al-Falah. While in Lucknow, she was taken into custody by J&K police after an assault rifle was recovered from her car in Faridabad, which, according to police, had been placed there by Muzammil himself. Police sources said Shaheen was also an active part of the terror module.The third doctor, Umar Un Nabi, was allegedly seen driving the i20 that went off near Red Fort on Monday evening. Like the others, Nabi, too, had been teaching MBBS students at Al-Falah for the past three years. The university itself boasts a faculty of around 250 for MBBS, pharmacy and paramedical courses.Also under police scanner, Mohd Istaq is a cleric at the mosque where the university community - teaching and non-teaching staff and students - regularly gathered. From Sringar village of Nuh, Istaq has been associated with the mosque since 2006. He earns a modest salary of Rs 6,000 a month and lives in a small room behind the mosque with his wife, four children and cattle.Recently, Istaq built a single-storey house in Dehar Colony, 4km from the Al-Falah campus. Of the four rooms in the house, two were leased to the family of a disabled truck cleaner, one was rented to Muzammil for Rs 1,500 a month, and a fourth remained vacant. It was in this room rented by Muzammil that 358kg of ammonium nitrate was found stored on Saturday.In the wake of these revelations, Faridabad police on Tuesday launched a massive search and combing operation at the university and surrounding areas. More than 800 cops, divided into six teams led by ACP-rank officers, conducted intensive searches in the area.According to a senior police officer, around 70 people were detained briefly for questioning. Faculty members and students who had close contact with the three doctors, as well as those from the same region as Muzammil, were interrogated. Police also questioned residents in Dhauj village, Dehar Colony and nearby areas, and are currently reviewing CCTV footage from around the university to track the movements of Muzammil and others who may have visited the two rented rooms under scrutiny.Yashpal, a spokesperson for Faridabad police, confirmed the scale of the operation. ""The FIR had been registered in J&K. It was only then that Muzammil was arrested, and the recovery of explosives and weapons were made from Faridabad. No FIR in connection with this case has been registered in Faridabad so far,"" he said.Many students and staff struggled to come to terms with the news that their campus had become the centre of a major terror investigation. ""We never imagined something like this could happen here. The university always prided itself on academic excellence and inclusivity. This has shaken us to the core,"" a faculty member said.","All roads in the blast investigation now lead to Al-Falah University in Faridabad. Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie and Shaheen Shahid were colleagues, doctors who taught MBBS programmes.

Marshawn Kneeland’s final messages before the tragedy





More NFL coverage

The final hours of Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland paint a deeply tragic picture of a young life spiraling out of control. The 24-year-old athlete, once celebrated for his explosive power on the field, was found dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound early Thursday morning, November 6, near a crashed vehicle north of Dallas. His sudden death stunned teammates, fans, and the NFL community who just days earlier had watched him score his first career touchdown on Monday Night Football.According to The Dallas Morning News, Kneeland’s body was discovered in a portable restroom near the intersection of Network Boulevard and Gaylord Parkway in Frisco, Texas. The location was only minutes away from The Star, the Cowboys’ headquarters, and close to the site where his vehicle had crashed along the Dallas Parkway. Investigators said the tragedy unfolded after Kneeland led Texas Department of Public Safety troopers on a brief police chase when he refused to stop for a traffic violation in Addison. Moments later, he collided with a pickup truck near the Dallas Tollway’s access lanes before fleeing on foot. “The driver of the truck was not injured in the accident,” Texas DPS spokesperson Josue De La Cerda told the newspaper.As officers searched the area, authorities began receiving alarming reports suggesting that Marshawn Kneeland was in emotional distress.PEOPLE reported that Kneeland sent a “goodbye” text to his loved ones, prompting his girlfriend, Catalina, to contact police. She warned that he was armed and had a history of mental illness. At nearly the same time, a representative from the NFL called the Plano Police Department with similar information, confirming that multiple agencies were aware of his fragile mental state in the hours leading up to his death.Marshawn Kneeland, a Michigan native and a second-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, was known for his quiet confidence and work ethic. His sudden passing triggered an outpouring of grief across the league. On Sunday, November 9, NFL teams across the country - including in Berlin, Germany, where the Indianapolis Colts faced the Atlanta Falcons - observed a moment of silence to honor his memory. His story now stands as a sobering reminder of the unseen struggles many athletes face behind their public glory. Tributes are still pouring for the Cowboys star.","The 24-year-old athlete was found dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound early Thursday morning, November 6, near a crashed vehicle north of Dallas.

Kash Patel’s Jet Scandal Erupts; $60M FBI Plane For Girlfriend’s Show? FBI Chief Slams Critics

3 lawsuits, 3 MAGA voices





Why conspiracy theorists believe Kash Patel's girlfriend is a spy









Kyle Seraphin, Sam Parker and Elijah Schaffer have been sued by Kash Patel 's girlfriend Alexis Wilkins for spreading malicious lies about Alexis that she works for the Israeli spy agency and 'honeytrapped' FBI director Kash Patel. Wilkins sought $5 million from each of them in damages after relentlessly fighting the rumor, claiming she has no connection with Israel. But MAGA has now drawn a line and stood by the conspiracy theorists as they are all MAGA voices, and condemned Wilkins' action against 'freedom of speech'.Though FBI director Patel is not involved with the lawsuits filed by his musician girlfriend, MAGA claimed that Patel's foundation, 'Kash Foundation', is behind the lawsuits. Kyle Seraphin, a former FBI agent who has been targeting Patel and his girlfriend and is one of the recipients of the lawsuit, claimed that the Binnall Law Group, led by Jesse R Binnall, filed the suit. Seraphin claimed that Binnall is also the president of the Kash Foundation, making it clear that Kash Patel, not as the FBI director, but in his personal capacity, is behind the lawsuits.The court filing against Seraphin said he has maliciously lied about Alexis Wilkins, falsely asserting that she—an American-born country singer—is an agent of foreign government, assigned to manipulate and compromise the Director of the FBI.Then, Wilkins filed a lawsuit against Sam Parker, who is also a former US Senate candidate in Utah. “Parker has repeatedly lied about Wilkins, falsely asserting and suggesting that she—an American-born country singer—is an agent of foreign government, assigned to manipulate and compromise the Director of the FBI,"" the lawsuit against Parker said.The lawsuit against Elijah created a storm as Elijah did not post anything about Patel and Wilkins but shared a post with a photo of them. “Schaffer has perpetuated a malicious lie about Alexis Wilkins, falsely claiming that she—an American-born country singer—is an agent of foreign government, assigned to manipulate and compromise the Director of the FBI,"" the lawsuit against Schaffer said.MAGA activists expressed their disenchantment with Patel as Candace Owens called for Patel's resignation and called him a ""teenager in love"" representing the Federal government. ""Apparently when governments and people in powerful positions get caught lying, their only weapon is to sue people. It is absolutely pathetic and it’s meant to scare us into silence. “We will bankrupt you!” These people should be treated with contempt,"" Candace wrote.One of the main reasons behind this conspiracy theory is Alexis' association with PragerU whose CEO is a former Israeli soldier. Alexis Wilkins asserted that she is a presenter on the platform and she had never been to Israel. She is a Christian American born in the US.Another reason behind the conspiracy theory is the age difference between Kash Patel (45) and Wilkins (26). Conspiracy theorists believe Patel has been honeytrapped. But they have been dating since 2023, before Patel became the FBi director.","MAGA activists have been suing Kash Patel's girlfriend Alexis Wilkins for 'honeytrapping' the FBI director.

The ministry said it was not immediately clear how many crew members were on board, according to Euro News.Video footage aired by local media appeared to show the plane spiralling down with a trail of white smoke before crashing. A search and rescue operation has been launched in coordination with Azerbaijani and Georgian authorities.Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said he was “deeply saddened” by the incident and expressed condolences to the families of those killed. While confirming there were casualties, Erdoğan did not provide further details.Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev also extended condolences to his Turkish counterpart, saying: “We were deeply saddened by the tragic news of the loss of servicemen in the crash of a Turkish Air Force military cargo plane, which took off from Ganja and crashed in Georgian territory.In this moment of sorrow, I share your grief and, on behalf of myself and the people of Azerbaijan, extend heartfelt condolences to you, the families and loved ones of the deceased, and the fraternal people of Türkiye. ”The Georgian interior ministry said the crash occurred near the town of Sighnaghi, close to the Azerbaijani border, and that an investigation has been opened to determine the cause.The C-130E Hercules, a four-engine turboprop tactical airlifter, is widely used by the Turkish armed forces for personnel transport and logistical operations.","A Turkish military cargo plane with 20 people on board crashed in Georgia near the Azerbaijani border on Tuesday.

Sued for a repost? MAGA disowns Kash Patel, stands with Elijah









Right-wing podcaster Candace Owens has now called for FBI director Kash Patel's resignation after his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins sued Elijah Schaffer for $5 million. Schaffer, a MAGA podcaster, reposted a thread on the viral conspiracy theory that Wilkins is a Mossad agent and she honeytrapped Kash Patel. Schaffer did not add anything on his part to the viral thread but posted a photo of Patel with his girlfriend.Schaffer became the third MAGA operative to have been sued by Kash Patel's girlfriend -- the other two being Kyle Seraphin, a former FBI agent, and Sam Paker , an influencer. Wilkins repeatedly dismissed these conspiracy theories about her and asserted that she has no connection with Israel, never been there, and she has been dating Kash Patel before Patel became the FBI director.As the conspiracy theory is being churned by MAGA insiders, it is clear that Patel has been isolated inside MAGA. And now, Candace has openly called for Patel's resignation. ""Kash Patel has to step down. This is excruciatingly embarrassing. He’s a teenager in love representing the Federal government,"" Candace said.Responding to the lawsuit in a post on X, Schaffer called it ""the legal equivalent of your romantic partner getting mad at you for cheating on her in her dream"".""Totally delusional and paranoid legal behavior - still can’t believe Kash is trusted w/ the FBI & sanctioned this stupidity,"" Schaffer wrote. Schaffer also appealed to Elon Musk for help reminding Musk that he once said he would pay for the legal fees of anyone sued for their free speech posts on X.Elijah Schaffer is where MAGA drew the line and pushed back on Alexis Wilkins' lawsuits. MAGA activists ranted that the FBI director has no real job but to fund his girlfriend's lawsuits against people who share some posts on social media.But Patel made it clear before that he would not allow any attack on his family. In a long post that he recently made, he also hinted that the attacks were coming from supposed allies. “The disgustingly baseless attacks against Alexis — a true patriot and the woman I’m proud to call my partner in life — are beyond pathetic. She is a rock-solid conservative and a country music sensation who has done more for this nation than most will in ten lifetimes. I’m so blessed she’s in my life. Attacking her isn’t just wrong — it’s cowardly and jeopardizes our safety.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi blast was carried out in panic and desperation by a member of a Jaish module after raids by alert security agencies successfully busted its hideouts and bases across J&K, Haryana and UP, according to sources in the security establishment.""Raids by security agencies across multiple locations in Delhi-NCR and Pulwama, which led to the recovery of nearly 3,000kg of explosives, are believed to have forced the suspect to act hastily under mounting pressure,"" a senior officer of the central security establishment told TOI.Sources said the haste was confirmed by the fact that the bomb used for the blast was loosely assembled and not fully developed, thus limiting the impact. The explosion did not create a crater and no shrapnel or projectiles were found.""Dr Umar, a member of the module, changed his location from Al Falah Medical College campus following the crackdown on other members of his module. He is the one who was driving the car used in the blast, as corroborated by CCTV footage. The blast was caused by the very same explosives that were found in Faridabad hideouts,"" said an officer.""Whether this blast was premeditated or accidental is a matter of investigation,"" the officer added. Sources said a few factors, however, pointed to an unintended explosion, including the fact that the vehicle was moving amid traffic and was not driven into a crowd, a common strategy used in vehicle-borne IED attacks to maximise casualty. The possibility of the explosives getting activated while being transported from point A to B is also not being ruled out.While describing the loss of deaths as tragic, officials said a major strike could not be carried out because of the alertness shown by cops in taking cognisance of the Jaish posters in J&K and the subsequent efforts of intelligence and police forces.The officer said demolition of the Jaish module responsible for the Delhi blast displayed the country's alertness levels against terror. ""This is a success of our intelligence agencies, security apparatus and law enforcement officers,"" the officer added.As reported by TOI on Monday, the origins of the Jaish module case investigation lay in a few objectionable posters that had come up in Srinagar. An FIR was registered in the case on Oct 19.","Raids by security agencies across multiple locations in Delhi-NCR and Pulwama led to the recovery of nearly 3,000kg of explosives.

For the family of Mohammad Jumman (35), an e-rickshaw driver from Shastri Park in northeast Delhi, Monday night was one of agonising uncertainty. His phone location had last shown him stuck in traffic near Lal Qila, after which all contact was lost.Early Tuesday morning, the family reached the LNJP mortuary, their emotions swinging helplessly between hope and despair. His brother Chand showed TOI a screenshot on his phone of Jumman’s last-traced location, frozen amid heavy traffic. Beside him, their uncle Idris clutched a photograph of Jumman on his phone, waiting anxiously for confirmation of what they feared but refused to believe.The family left the hospital premises with tear-stained eyes, still holding to a faint hope that there had been some mistake. Jumman’s 10-year-old son clung tightly to his mother’s finger, trying to console her. A few hours later, their worst fears were confirmed: the body had been identified as Jumman’s. The news shattered whatever strength they had been holding onto, said Idris.Jumman, the family’s sole breadwinner, was the reason his three children, a son and two daughters, were able to attend school, studying in classes 5 to 7.

EU Divided Ahead Of COP30 In Brazil; Chaos Over Climate Targets; Green Dream Falters?





The 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) began on Monday in Belém, Brazil, bringing together around 50,000 participants from more than 190 countries, including diplomats, policymakers, and climate experts, for the 11-day event in the Amazon region.However, the opening day was disrupted by heavy rain that caused flooding in several parts of the city, including Parque da Cidade, one of the main conference venues. The press center was among the affected areas, with videos of the flooding widely shared on social media.The sound of heavy rain also disrupted several press conferences, with UNHCR High Commissioner Filippo Grandi remarking that he was unable to hear questions being asked, as cited by Folha De S Paulo.Many social media users highlighted the irony of the situation, noting that a climate conference aimed at addressing environmental challenges was disrupted by severe weather.""One day, there's a water shortage. The next, there's a surplus. They outdid themselves this time!"" a comment on X read.""It's truly shameful! An international event of this magnitude, like the COP 30, deserved infrastructure up to the task, and a basic error like a leaking roof reveals a total lack of preparation and planning.It sends a bad image of the country and shows disregard for organization and responsibility,"" read another comment.Meanwhile, on Tuesday, a group of activists also clashed with security personnel at the COP30 venue, briefly attempting to enter the main conference area before being stopped.According to the United Nations, two security staff members sustained minor injuries. The incident occurred late in the day as attendees were leaving the site of the climate talks.“Earlier this evening, a group of protesters breached security barriers at the main entrance to the COP, causing minor injuries to two security staff, and minor damage to the venue,” the UN climate change said through a statement, as reported by AP.Some of the demonstrators entering the venue were heard chanting, “they cannot decide for us without us,” highlighting tensions over the level of Indigenous participation in the conference.","The 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) began on Monday in Belém, Brazil.

"US govt shutdown nears end: Airlines cancel 1,200 flights; FAA, carriers discuss gradual rollback",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-govt-shutdown-nears-end-airlines-cancel-1200-flights-faa-carriers-discuss-gradual-rollback/articleshow/125263751.cms,"1000+ Flights Cancelled As Shutdown Severely Impacts American Aviation Sector





Airlines in the United States cancelled nearly 1,200 flights on Tuesday (local time), showing signs of recovery as air traffic control staffing improved markedly ahead of an anticipated resolution to the record 42-day government shutdown expected as soon as Wednesday.According to Reuters, the cancellations followed a chaotic Monday when 2,400 flights were cancelled and 9,600 delayed nationwide. By Tuesday, delays had dropped to 1,700 — the best operational performance the industry has recorded in recent days.Last week, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had instructed airlines to reduce their daily flight schedules by 4% at 40 major airports starting November 7 due to staffing shortages among air traffic controllers. The reductions climbed to 6% on Tuesday and were projected to reach 8% on Thursday and 10% on Friday, November 14. Discussions between airlines and the FAA are underway on how and when these cuts can be reduced or lifted as the shutdown edges toward conclusion.President Donald Trump on Monday warned that air traffic controllers who refused to return to work could face pay cuts, adding that he would welcome resignations from those not fulfilling their duties.Some carriers have begun holding off on deeper reductions. United Airlines said on Tuesday that it has cut about 5% of its scheduled flights for Thursday, short of the planned 8%.Sources told Reuters that several options are being explored by the FAA to phase out the reductions. Air traffic staffing levels improved sharply on Tuesday, with only four issues reported compared to 81 on Saturday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said.At a press briefing at Chicago O’Hare International Airport, Duffy stated that adjustments would be made gradually as safety allows. “When that data changes, we're going to start taking that down from 6%, maybe we’ll go to four, two, and get back to normal air travel,” Duffy said. “It depends on controllers coming back to work.”Meanwhile, the Senate voted late Monday to pass legislation funding the government through January 30. The House is expected to consider the bill on Wednesday. Duffy warned that if the House fails to pass the measure, flight disruptions could worsen this weekend. “That’s how serious this is,” he said, noting that some major airlines might be forced to halt operations.Since the shutdown began on October 1, air traffic absences have led to tens of thousands of cancellations and delays, affecting an estimated 1.2 million passengers over the weekend alone. The ongoing shutdown — the longest in US history — has required 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents to work without pay.The FAA currently faces a shortfall of about 3,500 air traffic controllers, many of whom were already working six-day weeks and mandatory overtime even before the shutdown began.","Airlines in the United States cancelled nearly 1,200 flights on Tuesday (local time) The cancellations followed a chaotic Monday when 2,400 flights were cancelled and 9,600 delayed nationwide.

'This couldn’t come at a worse time'









The president of the United States could take Britain’s national broadcaster to court amid a debate over editorial decisions at the BBC that has claimed two of its most senior executives.Contents of a memo sent to a BBC internal editorial standards committee by Michael Prescott, a former external adviser, was published by the Daily Telegraph newspaper between November 3-6.It raised concerns about the BBC’s coverage of immigration, racism, historical content, transgender issues, and BBC Arabic’s coverage of the Gaza war.It also highlighted issues with an episode of the BBC’s flagship current affairs program, Panorama.Prescott cited problems with the show’s depiction of Trump’s speech to supporters in Washington DC on January 6, 2021, as the US Congress prepared to certify the election victory of Joe Biden. Following that speech, the crowd marched to the US Capitol building, with a violent riot ensuing.Screened a week before the 2024 presidential election, Prescott raised concerns about the way the episode fused two separate clips together to give the impression that Trump incited the crowd’s actions on January 6.In reality, the clips took place almost an hour apart. The omitted period included a moment where Trump called for a peaceful march to the Capitol building.On Sunday, the BBC’s Director-General Tim Davie and head of news and current affairs Deborah Turness resigned from their positions. Both have dismissed suggestions of systemic bias at the broadcaster.In a letter to MPs, the broadcaster’s chair Samir Shah said the BBC accepted ""that the way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action"" and apologized ""for that error of judgement.""A lawyer for Trump has now called on the BBC to apologize, retract the documentary and ""appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused"" by Friday, November 14, 2025, or face a $1 billion (about €863 million) lawsuit.Media observers have said the memo’s criticisms of the Panorama edit are reasonable, but are concerned about wider attacks on the BBC’s record of impartiality.""It certainly was a mistake,"" said Mel Bunce, director of the Centre for Journalism and Democracy at City St George's University, UK. ""My far greater concern is the attacks on the BBC that are resulting from this.""Similarly, Dafydd Townley, a political historian at Portsmouth University and chair of the UK American Politics Group, said the possibility of legal action against the broadcaster could ""severely impinge the BBC’s reputation in the US, but also its ability to report and gain extensive reach in the US.""The BBC has ranked in the top three of 52 news sources in the United States in YouGov’s annual trust in media poll since 2022.The fallout has continued to raise questions about the broadcaster, particularly ahead of a scheduled review to be carried out by the UK government. The BBC is publicly funded by a license fee paid by households with televisions or who use streaming services; however its decision-making is independent from the government.It is not the first time Donald Trump has been willing to take legal action against media organizations. His most recent activities have seen some of the biggest American media companies sued for millions, or billions of dollars. These have included CNN, ABC (US) and CBS, and the owners of major newspapers like the Wall Street Journal and New York Times. Journalists attached to reporting on Trump have also been sued by the president.Recent cases brought by Trump against other large media companies include:Donald Trump filed against CNN in October 2022 for $475 million. A chief allegation in the filing was that CNN’s use of the phrase ""the Big Lie"" to describe Trump’s claims the 2020 election was stolen from him, associated him with Adolf Hitler. A US federal judge dismissed the case in July 2023, saying the statements made on CNN ""while repugnant, were not, as a matter of law, defamatory.""In December 2024, ABC News agreed to pay $15 million toward a foundation for Trump’s presidential library after it settled a lawsuit with the president. Trump brought a defamation lawsuit against ABC after its news anchor George Stephanopoulos inaccurately described on-air the verdicts of New York writer E. Jean Carroll’s civil case against the president.In July 2025, Paramount Global, which owns the broadcaster CBS, agreed to settle a $20 billion lawsuit brought against it. Trump had sued CBS for the way it edited an interview with his presidential election rival Kamala Harris for an episode of its flagship current affairs program, 60 Minutes.In July 2025, Donald Trump sued the Wall Street Journal and its owners, including Rupert Murdoch, for at least $10 billion for publishing a story that quoted a 2003 letter it said was signed by him and written to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The Journal and its owners have defended the reporting publicly and have said they will contest the lawsuit.In October 2025, Trump refiled a $15 billion lawsuit brought by Trump against the New York Times and three of its journalists. The original filing was tossed by District Court Judge Steven Merryday in September. The Times, two of its reporters and the book publisher Penguin Random House as named defendants.With a November 14 deadline, it is unclear how the president’s latest legal threats against the BBC will play out, particularly as the Panorama episode was not screened or available in the US.But combined with non-legal actions, such as removing the Associated Press from the White House press gallery or issuing orders to scrap funding for public broadcasters PBS and NPR, Voice of America and Radio free Europe, the threat of litigation continues a trend of actions by the president against legacy media organizations.In May 2025, Reporters Without Borders said Trump’s second term in office had ""led to an alarming deterioration in press freedom.""Editorial standards, freedom of the press and the way that public and private media organizations are able to report on government activities and politicians is something that continues to come under strain. Townley said long-established media houses have been less able to perform their traditional role.""We have to have, not just concerns about editorial processes within the BBC, but also about executive branch attitudes towards press,"" said Townley.""It is just an indication of that relationship between the fourth estate [the press] and the executive branch is under extreme pressure at the moment.""""That’s a big concern for many in the US, and who is going to hold the executive branch and the federal government to account in the way that the mainstream media should be doing?""Irrespective of whether Trump takes action against the BBC, there are also concerns about how this current challenge to the broadcaster will impact ongoing discussions around its role in Britain and abroad. Bunce points to the fact that the BBC is responsible for major non-news cultural outputs, and also provides independent media services to regions around the world through the BBC World Service, an equivalent entity to DW.""The main concern here is that this will feed into political arguments that will influence the funding decisions, that the BBC might get defunded, not just its news organizations but also its high quality cultural industries.""""This couldn’t come at a worse time, these questions about its editorial integrity.""","President of the United States could take Britain’s national broadcaster to court amid a debate over editorial decisions. Two of its most senior executives have resigned from their positions. The fallout has continued to raise questions about the broadcaster, particularly ahead of a scheduled review to be carried out by the UK government.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125262846,imgsize-949713,width-400,resizemode-4/ap-file-photo.jpg"

Big Relief For Indians: Donald Trump Clarifies $100K H-1B Fee Won’t Apply To Existing Visa Holders

A Redditor expressed concern whether his failure to declare pork fry in his luggage would have any negative impact on his US visa.

What food items to declare before entering the US



What is allowed



Commercially packaged, sealed, and labelled items

Baked goods, candy, tea, coffee (without citrus or fruit peel)

Dry spices (except those with seeds, like mustard or cardamom pods)

Infant food or formula in sealed containers

What is not allowed



Fresh fruits and vegetables (risk of pests)

Raw or dried meat, sausages, jerky (unless USDA-approved)

Foods containing beef, pork, poultry, or eggs from certain countries

Homemade items with animal ingredients





A Redditor expressed his concern over his future in the US as he failed to declare a food item he was carrying with him. He was fined $300 for breaking the law but he asked fellow Redditors whether this penalty will have any negative impact on his visa status.The man said he was asked at US preclearance at Abu Dhabi Airport whether they were carrying any food items. They informed the CBP officers that they were carrying pickles, snacks and spice powders. On being asked more about pickles, they told the CBP officers that they were carrying fish and beef pickles. This led to a second inspection in which their bags were opened and checked. The officers found a packet of pork fry. They were fined $300 for not declaring it earlier.The man clarified that it was a genuine slip up and they were not hiding anything and thought pork fry comes under snacks. ""After arriving in the US, we noticed they had discarded the beef pickle but not the fish pickle (store-bought and sealed). The beef and pork ones were homemade,"" the man said expressing his concern whether he will now be considered a delinquent that would reflect on his visa or H-1B stamping.Social media users assured that it won't become a problem as far as his stay or H-1B visa is concerned but it will remain in the CBP record and he will always get extra scrutiny.All food items -- irrespective of what is allowed and what is not -- have to be declared on US customs Declaration form or at the kiosk or questions during customs.

US President Donald Trump used his Veterans Day address on Tuesday to slam long-standing Western allies and claim that America’s military victories overshadow those of its partners.During the ceremony, Trump announced he would issue a proclamation designating the Veterans Day holiday as “Victory Day” for both World War I and World War II.“When I see other countries celebrating Victory Day … And I said, we got to have a Victory Day,” he told the audience at Arlington National Cemetery. “From now on, we’re going to be celebrating Victory Day for World War I, for World War II, and frankly, for everything else.”Trump added, ""I was recently at an event and I saw that France was celebrating Victory Day, but we didn't. And I saw France was celebrating another Victory Day for World War 2. And other countries were celebrating. They were all celebrating. We're the one that won the wars.""Trump pointed to France’s May 8 celebrations marking the defeat of Nazi Germany and Russia’s May 9 Victory Day, and questioned why the United States did not have a similar event.Trump also claimed that his administration had restored the pride of the US military by renaming the Department of Defence back to its original name, the Department of War. “Under the Trump administration, we’re restoring the pride and the winning spirit of the United States military,” he said. “That is why we have officially renamed the Department of Defense back to the original name Department of War.”Yet the GOP leader's remarks were shaky on the facts. Veterans Day was originally observed on November 11, 1919, as Armistice Day, marking the end of the First World War, and was renamed by Congress in 1954, according to the Independent. The holiday has long commemorated the service of US veterans rather than declaring victory over war itself.",US President Donald Trump used his Veterans Day address to slam long-standing Western allies.

'This Leader Can Do It': Trump Praises Al-Sharaa After Reporter's Bold Question On Ties With Syria

What did Trump and Sharaa discuss?

What is happening right now in Syria?





Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa met US President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, capping an extraordinary period for the 42-year-old rebel-turned-ruler.Little under a year ago, al-Sharaa led Islamist fighters from Syria's northwest in a lightning offensive that toppled Bashar Assad after 14 years of civil war.He was the first Syrian head of state to visit the White House.Sharaa aimed to secure full removal of US sanctions, but after his closed-door meeting with Trump, the Treasury extended its suspension of Caesar sanctions for 180 days. Only Congress can lift them entirely.Afterward, Trump said Sharaa ""comes from a very tough place,"" describing the Syrian leader as a ""tough guy"" and adding: ""I like him.""""We'll do everything we can to make Syria successful because that's part of the Middle East.""The pair first met in Riyadh six months ago at a Gulf security summit.The US is brokering a possible security pact between Syria and Israel and considering a small military presence at a Damascus airbase, according to diplomatic sources.Trump, who recently lifted most US sanctions on Syria, said before the meeting that ""a lot of progress has been made with Syria"" and praised al-Sharaa as ""a tough guy in a tough neighborhood.""Al-Sharaa's government has been consolidating control while facing renewed sectarian unrest that has killed more than 2,500 people since Assad's fall. Two Islamic State plots to assassinate him were reportedly foiled in recent months, prompting a nationwide crackdown on the group.However, skeptics of the Syrian leader have pointed to the wave of sectarian violence in which pro-government Sunni gunmen killed hundreds of civilians from the Alawite and Druze minorities.","Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa met US President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday.

Influential Democrat Ilhan Omar responded to Donald Trump publicly after the US President mocked her for quoting the US Constitution and speaking out on national politics. The clash erupted after Trump targeted the Minnesota leader during an interview on Fox News.Trump used Omar as an example while slamming the Democratic Party, questioning her right to comment on governance because of her foreign background. “I look at somebody that comes from Somalia, where they don’t have anything, they don’t have police, they don’t have military, they don’t have anything,” Trump said on The Ingraham Angle.“All they have is crime and she comes in and tells us how to run our country.” He continued by mimicking her references to the Constitution, saying, “‘The Constitution says this, the Constitution says…’ The whole thing is crazy.”Omar did not let Trump's comment slide. Posting on X, she replied, “Unlike you, I can read and that’s why I know what the constitution says,” attaching a clip of Trump’s comments.Omar fled Somalia’s civil war as a child and became a US citizen at 17. She has long been one of the most important progressive voices in Congress.The exchange follows a series of remarks by the MAGA chief suggesting Omar should “go back” to Somalia, according to The Hill.In September, Trump told reporters he had joked about sending her back and claimed the Somali president had no interest in taking her. Omar has dismissed such threats, saying in a recent interview, “I have no worry. I don’t know how they’d take away my citizenship and, like, deport me.”She added that she is no longer the frightened child who fled conflict. “I’m grown. My kids are grown.

Why Trump Has Gone Nuclear Against BBC? Inside Story Of Huge Speech Scandal

What Trump actually said



What happens next







A major row broke out after US President Donald Trump threatened to sue the BBC for at least one billion dollars over what he says is a misleading edit of his January 6 speech. The clash has triggered resignations at the top of the broadcaster,The Panorama episode at the centre of the controversy stitched together two separate lines from Trump’s 2021 speech in Washington. The edit made it appear as though he delivered one continuous call to march on the Capitol with the words: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.” The sequence suggested Trump urged the crowd towards direct confrontation.BBC leadership later acknowledged the mistake. The organisation admitted the edit created a misleading impression and apologised for what it called an “error of judgement”. The fallout was immediate, with both Director General Tim Davie and News chief Deborah Turness stepping down.Transcripts and footage of the day show the two statements were delivered separately. Trump initially told supporters: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.” Much later, in a different part of the rally, he said: “We fight like hell.And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.” The remarks were controversial at the time and featured heavily in his impeachment proceedings, but they were not spoken as a single inciting statement.Trump’s lawyers have issued a formal notice demanding a retraction, an apology and compensation for what they described as “false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading and inflammatory statements”. The BBC has said it will review the complaint and respond formally.The broadcaster is now dealing with its most serious leadership crisis in years. Tim Davie told staff the BBC must “fight for our journalism” as he confirmed he would stay on only until an orderly transition is arranged. Senior figures, including Chair Samir Shah, have said that the corporation must rebuild confidence while maintaining high editorial standards.",Donald Trump threatens to sue the BBC over what he says is a misleading edit of his January 6 speech.

US President Donald Trump revealed first lady Melania Trump is now supportive of his plan to replace the East Wing with the new $300 million ballroom, even though she was not “fully onboard” when the idea was first raised.The MAGA chief spoke about the renovation during an interview on Fox News, offering new details about how his wife reacted to the project.Trump told host Laura Ingraham that Melania had initially been protective of her old workspace. “She loved her little, tiny office,” he said, responding to a Wall Street Journal report that she had privately raised concerns about the demolition of the East Wing. He did not deny the report but insisted she warmed up to the renovation quickly. “She’s very smart,” he said. “In about one day she, if you were to ask her now, she’d say, ‘It’s great. ’”The construction began late last month and will see the 1902 East Wing replaced with a 90,000 square foot ballroom. Trump described the original building as poorly constructed. “It was made out of common brick, little, tiny windows. It looked like hell,” he told Ingraham.The GOP leader said that earlier renovations had made the structure unsuitable for White House needs.“I didn’t want to sacrifice a great ballroom for an OK ballroom by leaving it right smack in the middle,” he said.The project is funded entirely through donations, according to Trump but the Democrats are not ready to believe this.Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton posted on X, “It’s not his house. It’s your house. And he’s destroying it.” Michelle Obama also objected, saying the East Wing “is the heart of the work” of any first lady.Trump defended the construction by arguing that the White House needs a proper space for large official events. He said previous administrations relied on tents on the lawn.","Donald Trump revealed first lady Melania Trump is now supportive of his plan to replace the East Wing with the new $300 million ballroom.

Russia Hits Back At U.S. Nuclear Claims, Clarifies Recent Missile Launches Not Linked To Nukes





Russia on Tuesday said it was prepared to hold talks with the United States over accusations made by US President Donald Trump that Moscow had secretly carried out underground nuclear tests, while firmly denying any wrongdoing.Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov told state media that Moscow was open to engaging with Washington on the issue, news agency AFP reported.""We are ready to discuss the suspicions raised by our American colleagues regarding the possibility that we might be secretly doing something deep underground,"" he said.He added that Moscow rejected the claims outright, calling them baseless and politically motivated. Lavrov highlighted that the United States could verify any alleged test through the global seismic monitoring system.“Other tests, both subcritical, or those without a chain nuclear reaction, and carrier tests, have never been prohibited,” Lavrov clarified.The comments came amid renewed tensions over nuclear testing and arms control, following recent remarks by Trump suggesting that the US could resume nuclear testing after more than three decades.In an interview with CBS News and later on his Truth Social platform, Trump claimed that Russia and China may have been conducting secret nuclear tests underground.“Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it,” he said. He further added that the US should resume its own testing “on an equal basis.”Trump also announced that he had instructed the “Department of War” to begin nuclear weapons testing.Earlier in a post on Truth Social, Trump said: ""The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country. This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice! Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.""However, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright later clarified that any such tests would be non-explosive and limited to systems testing within safety parameters, not full-scale nuclear detonations.Following Trump’s comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed his top officials to prepare proposals for a possible resumption of nuclear tests, though he reiterated that Moscow would only act if Washington did so first.“I ask the defence ministry, the foreign ministry, and other relevant agencies to analyse Washington’s statements and prepare proposals for resuming nuclear weapons tests,” Putin said at a meeting of Russia’s Security Council.Putin emphasized that Russia remained committed to its moratorium on nuclear testing, in line with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), but would respond in kind if the US broke that commitment.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also reaffirmed this position, stating: “Putin has repeatedly said that Russia adheres to its obligations under the nuclear tests ban and we are not going to carry them out, but if another country does, we will have to do so to observe parity.”Lavrov, in a separate interview, said Moscow was still awaiting a response from Washington on President Putin’s proposal to extend a voluntary freeze on strategic nuclear weapons beyond the expiration of the New START Treaty in February 2026.“The constructive initiative put forward by President Putin in the post-New START sphere speaks for itself,” Lavrov said. He added that Russia’s proposal “requires no hidden agenda or additional efforts.”The New START Treaty, signed in 2010 and extended for five years in 2021, limits each side to 1550 deployed warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers.However, direct verification has been suspended since the Ukraine conflict began, leaving the future of nuclear arms control uncertain.Both Moscow and Washington have observed a voluntary halt on explosive nuclear testing since the early 1990s. The US last conducted a nuclear test in 1992, while Russia’s last was in 1990.In recent months, Russia has tested new nuclear-capable systems — including the “Burevestnik” nuclear-powered cruise missile and the “Poseidon” underwater drone. However, analysts highlight that these were weapons system trials, not nuclear detonations.The renewed rhetoric on nuclear testing comes amid rising global concern over the erosion of long-standing arms-control agreements.Experts warn that any resumption of nuclear tests by either power could trigger a new phase of the nuclear arms race and weaken the global non-proliferation framework.","Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow was open to engaging with Washington on the issue. Lavrov highlighted that the United States could verify any alleged test through the global seismic monitoring system.

Pakistan blames Afghanistan's Taliban government

ISLAMABAD: A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence that the defence minister said had pushed the country into a ""state of war"".Pakistani govt ministers accused neighbouring Afghanistan of complicity in the bloodshed - an accusation Kabul denied - and vowed retaliation if Afghan authorities failed to rein in the militants Islamabad says were responsible. ""We are in a state of war,"" said defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif after the attack, the first strike on civilians in Islamabad in a decade. ""Bringing this war to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which Pakistan has the full power to respond. ""The bombing outside an Islamabad court also wounded 27 people interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said. The court bomber blew himself up near the entrance at around lunchtime. Images on local media showed people covered in blood lying next to a police van. A vehicle was seen on fire and another car was badly damaged. Police cordoned off the site. Naqvi said the bomber had tried to enter the court building on foot but, unable to find a way in, detonated the device outside, close to a police vehicle.Several of the wounded were in critical condition, a hospital source said.No group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack. The main Pakistani militant group, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), denied involvement in the attacks. But a group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, according to The Khorasan Diary, a digital platform in Islamabad that monitors militant activity in the region.TTP militants have in recent years focused attacks on security forces. Civilians had not been hit in Islamabad for a decade, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a group that tracks attacks.Islamabad says that the Pakistani Taliban and other militants are based in Afghanistan, with the support of India. ""We are totally clear that Afghanistan has to stop them. In case of a failure, we have no option but to take care of those terrorists who are attacking our country,"" Naqvi said, speaking at the scene of the court bombing. The Taliban administration spokesperson in Kabul did not respond to a request for comment on Pakistan's accusations.The court attack happened hours after militants stormed a school near the Afghan border on Monday. The attack on the school in Wana, in the north west, began Monday, when a suicide vehicle rammed the main entrance, killing three people, Naqvi said. Militants then entered the school, which is run by the military but educates civilians.By Tuesday evening, three militants were still inside the compound, security officials said, with rescue operations under way for the students trapped in another part of the school. Naqvi said that the school assailants were in contact with their handlers in Afghanistan during the attack.Reuters","A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence.

Surge in militant violence and worsening ties with Afghanistan







Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country was “in a state of war” after a suicide bomber struck outside the Islamabad district courts on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people and injuring 27.The blast one of the deadliest to hit the capital in recent years has intensified tensions with Afghanistan, with Asif accusing the Taliban government in Kabul of allowing militants to operate freely.In a post on X, Asif said: “Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan should take today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts as a wake-up call: This is a war for all of Pakistan.”He wrote that Pakistan’s military was making “daily sacrifices while providing citizens with a sense of protection and security”, but warned that hoping for negotiations with Kabul would be a “mistake”. Asif insisted that Afghanistan “has the ability to prevent terrorist attacks inside Pakistan” and that bringing the conflict to the capital was “a message from Kabul”.He added that Pakistan “has the strength to respond fully”, saying the attack had erased any remaining doubts about the threat posed by militants operating from Afghan soil.The explosion took place around midday in Islamabad’s G-11 district, just outside the judicial complex where hundreds of lawyers and visitors were present. Police said the attacker tried to enter the court premises but failed, eventually detonating explosives next to a police vehicle, igniting cars and sending a fireball through the street.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed that 12 people were killed and 27 wounded. He said authorities had recovered a severed head believed to be that of the attacker, and CCTV footage captured him moments before the blast. Witnesses described scenes of chaos, with people screaming for help as ambulances rushed to the site.The blast comes amid a sharp rise in militant violence across Pakistan. Security officials say the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has carried out hundreds of attacks this year, mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa near the Afghan border, but strikes in major cities have been rare. Islamabad was last hit by a suicide attack three years ago.On Monday night, militants also attempted to storm an army-run college in Wana, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Security forces killed two attackers quickly, while others were cornered inside an administrative building. Students and staff were evacuated, and the military said the assault resembled the TTP’s 2014 massacre in Peshawar that killed 154 people.Pakistan says the Afghan Taliban have allowed TTP fighters to take refuge across the border. Afghanistan denies harbouring the group.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Sunday that it was committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban but demanded that Kabul must address concerns regarding the use of its territory by terrorists.Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi issued a statement on different media queries regarding the third round of talks with the Afghan Taliban regime in Istanbul on November 6, which concluded a day later. Turkiye and Qatar mediated the parleys.The peace talks ended without any agreement to tackle the thorny issues of cross-border terrorism , the top officials had said on Saturday.""Pakistan remains committed to the resolution of bilateral differences through dialogue. However, Pakistan's core concern, i.e. terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, needs to be addressed first and foremost,"" the FO said in a statement.It also said that Pakistan's Armed Forces and its people were well determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism from its soil and take action against its supporters, abettors and financiers.In the long statement, the spokesperson said that for the past four years, since the Taliban regime came to power in Afghanistan, there has been a sharp surge in terrorist attacks emanating from Afghan soil.""Throughout these years, Pakistan, despite suffering military and civilian casualties, exercised maximum restraint and did not retaliate,"" it said.Pakistan's expectation was that the Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/Fitna al Khawarij (TTP/FaK) elements present on Afghan soil, the FO said.The Pakistan government last year notified the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as ""Fitna al-Khawarij"", a reference to a group in earlier Islamic history which was involved in violence.Pakistan also tried to positively engage with Afghanistan by offering bilateral trade concessions and humanitarian assistance, and the intention to constructively engage with Afghanistan so as to enable it to become a stable, peaceful and prosperous country that is at peace within and with its neighbours, the statement said.However, despite all these positive gestures, ""the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction,"" it added.Instead of acting upon the core expectation to stop Afghan territory from being used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions, it said.""Instead, it has tried to confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues. By confusing the main issue of terrorism, it keeps trying to develop a narrative which absolves the Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards the international community and its own people,"" it added.The statement said that Pakistan's October 2025 response to the consistent attacks emanating from Afghanistan was a manifestation of the will and determination that it will not leave any stone unturned to safeguard its territory and its people.The statement added that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK terrorists.Pakistan also accused the Afghan Taliban of using the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue, adding that they had fled in 2015 to avoid a military operation and fought together with the Afghan Taliban against Nato troops.""These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by the Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to the Afghan Taliban,"" it said, and added that the same terrorists established training camps in Afghanistan to launch terrorist activities in Pakistan.The FO rejected the Kabul excuse of lack of control over TTP and demanded definite and concrete actions. Pakistan also rejected the portrayal of TTP as refugees and asked Kabul to hand them over to Pakistan.It said Pakistan has never eschewed dialogue with any Government in Kabul, but it would not hold dialogue with any terrorist group.",Pakistan says it is committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

What does it mean?



Opposition backlash and protests



Divided legal opinions



Support for reforms







Pakistan’s government has introduced a major constitutional change that has sparked widespread debate and protests across the country. The proposed 27th constitutional amendment, which will be voted on in Parliament next week, seeks to restructure the military’s chain of command and overhaul the judiciary, prompting strong criticism from the Opposition.The current move mirrors the era of General Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s longest-serving de facto head of state, who introduced sweeping constitutional changes to entrench military control under a civilian façade. The proposed 27th Amendment, risks reviving that legacy by placing the armed forces once again at the centre of Pakistan’s political structure.The bill, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after cabinet approval, proposes to abolish the post of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC) and replace it with a new and more powerful position -- chief of defence forces (CDF).According to reports in Dawn, the post will be held by the serving chief of army staff, who will also become the constitutional head of the army, navy and air force. This change would make General Asim Munir the most powerful military officer in Pakistan’s history, formalising his recent promotion to Field Marshal.The amendment also includes plans to set up a new federal constitutional court (FCC) and change how high court judges are appointed.It seeks to transfer some powers from the Supreme Court to the new court, while also granting the president lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution.Pakistan law minister Azam Nazir Tarar presented the bill in the senate, where chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani referred it to a committee led by Farooq Naek for review. Naek said the goal was to “create consensus among members” before the bill comes up for voting on Monday. The government is confident of securing a two-thirds majority in both the senate and the national assembly.Opposition parties have strongly opposed the amendment, calling it a direct threat to Pakistan’s Constitution. A coalition of opposition groups, the Tehreek-e-Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan (TTAP), which includes Imran Khan’s PTI, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) and the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) has announced nationwide protests starting Sunday.“Democratic institutions have been paralysed within Pakistan… the nation must step up against the [proposed] 27th Amendment,” MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said.PkMAP leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai said the protests would begin with the slogan: “Long live democracy, down with dictatorship.” He warned, “The opposition alliance had no choice but to launch a protest movement following the government’s move, which is shaking the foundations of the Constitution.”Legal experts are split on the amendment’s impact. Critics say it would reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, making it “irrelevant,” and tighten executive control over the judiciary.One senior counsel told Dawn, “Left with a limited jurisdiction of deciding ordinary civil, criminal and statutory appeals, the Supreme Court has now become all the more a ‘Supreme District Court’.”Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar warned that the changes would “empower [the new] Federal Constitutional Court by disempowering the Supreme Court.” He said the amendment also gives the Chief of the Defence Forces constitutional authority for life, formally recognising the Field Marshal rank.Another lawyer pointed out that under the new Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC would outrank the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and serve until the age of 68 -- three years longer than the current limit of 65.Some legal experts, however, have welcomed the changes. Senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar called the 27th Amendment “a major and long-awaited structural shift” in Pakistan’s justice system.He said the plan to have two separate apex courts -- one for appeals (Supreme Court) and one for constitutional cases (FCC) -- would bring “greater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence.”He also argued that the reforms could reduce political influence in the judiciary, cut down case backlogs, and modernise the justice system.Khokhar added that the new defence structure under Article 243 was in line with “modern constitutional democracies,” ensuring that the armed forces would operate under a single advisory framework accountable to the prime minister, defence minister and National Security Committee.Newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association in Pakistan, President Haroonur Rasheed also supported the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court, saying it could help streamline the judicial process.","Proposed 27th constitutional amendment will be voted on in Parliament next week. It seeks to restructure the military’s chain of command and overhaul the judiciary. The current move mirrors the era of General Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan's longest-serving de facto head of state.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125203879,imgsize-651535,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-42.jpg"

Blast Hits Jaffar Express in Pakistan, Several Injured

A train under siege



The months that followed saw a stream of attacks:

In October, a blast on the Sindh section of the railway line derailed five bogies and injured several passengers.

In September, an explosion on the track in Mastung derailed six coaches, leaving 12 injured.

In August, six coaches derailed after an improvised explosive device went off in Mastung, while days earlier a pilot engine came under gunfire.

In July and June, two separate blasts in Sindh derailed multiple coaches.

Late last year, a suicide bomber at Quetta Station killed at least 26 people.

Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday, citing “serious security concerns” in Balochistan, news agency PTI reported.The temporary suspension — enforced from 9 to 12 November — follows multiple insurgent attacks on the train over the past year, including a dramatic hijacking in March that left 26 people dead.Railway officials said the move came after fresh intelligence warnings of possible attacks targeting tracks, railway assets and civilian passengers. “The precautionary measure is based on advice from security and intelligence agencies to ensure the safety of passengers, railway staff, civilians and critical rail assets,” a senior official said, as quoted by PTI.The Jaffar Express is one of Pakistan’s busiest long-distance routes, carrying thousands of passengers daily at a cost far lower than road travel. Local commuters have criticised the shutdown, saying it leaves people in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with few affordable transport options.Over the past 12 months, the Jaffar Express has become a repeated target for insurgent groups, particularly the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).In March, BLA militants hijacked the train with 380 passengers on board, triggering a two-day standoff in a mountainous tunnel. Twenty-six people were killed before security forces rescued more than 350 passengers. Authorities said 33 militants also died in the rescue operation.Security officials say insurgent groups are increasingly targeting railways to cripple movement and signal the state’s inability to secure critical transport arteries. Analysts note that the frequency of attacks shows “a collapse of basic security control” across parts of Balochistan’s rail corridor.Political leaders in the province argue that Islamabad has ignored decades of local grievances. Balochistan National Party chief Akhtar Mengal recently warned that the state has “lost control” of the region, saying: “There is not a single inch of Balochistan left where the government can claim authority.”The suspension comes as Pakistan faces one of its most dangerous security challenges in years. Not only has the BLA intensified operations across Balochistan, but attacks linked to Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Islamic State Khorasan (ISK) and cross-border militants have surged.According to the latest Global Terrorism Index, Pakistan recorded a 45% jump in terrorism-related deaths this year. Security officials warn the country is now battling “four fronts at once”—an insurgent network straddling provincial, sectarian and cross-border lines.Diplomatic efforts have yielded little. Peace talks this week between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement, with both sides blaming each other for breakdowns in the ceasefire. Pakistan accuses Kabul of sheltering TTP fighters; the Taliban dismisses the allegations.","Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday.
