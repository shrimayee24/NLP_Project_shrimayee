7 armed ultras of Valley groupfired at

police commandos

GUWAHATI: Unidentified gunmen killed two migrant labourers from Bihar, while police shot an 18-year-old militant dead following a brief exchange of fire in violence-hit Manipur Saturday.Police said the labourers - identified as Sunalal Kumar, 18, and Dasharat Kumar, 17 - were travelling on bicycles when they were shot in the evening at Keirak in Kakching district. Both were residents of Rajwahi village in Gopalganj district of Bihar.The killings marked the second fatal attack on migrant workers since ethnic violence erupted in Manipur on May 3 last year. In May this year, unidentified assailants shot a 41-year-old migrant labourer dead and wounded two fellow workers in Imphal. They were from Godda district in Jharkhand. The gunfight in Thoubal district occurred near Salungpham High School at Salungpham Maning Leikai.Seven armed militants of the banned Imphal valley-based group PREPAK fired at a team of police commandos. Police overpowered the group and rounded up the seven, one of whom was found with a bullet wound. Laishram Prem died in a hospital in Imphal.The youth was missing since Aug 13 and his family had lodged a police report. He had joined PREPAK and was staying in Kakching Khunou, police said. Two Insas rifles, an Amogh rifle, a .303 rifle, an SLR rifle, 135 assorted bullets, and five mobile phones were seized from the militants. Police suspect the seized weapons were part of those stolen from their armouries during the initial stages of the ethnic unrest.More than 250 lives have been lost since the strife broke out, nearly 60,000 people displaced, and deep divisions have emerged between the Kuki-Zo tribal communities in the hill districts and the Meitei population in Imphal valley.",Unidentified gunmen killed two migrant labourers from Bihar.

NEW DELHI: After TMC and Samajwadi Party expressed their unease over disruptions in Parliament because of Adani issue, Nationalist Congress Party Sharad Pawar ) has also distanced itself from Congress's efforts to attack the govt over its alleged links to the conglomerate.In Lok Sabha, NCP (SP)'s Amol Kolhe said there was no need to remain stuck on the relations between an industrialist and a political leader, a clear attempt by the party to distance itself from Congress, whose protests over Adani's indictment in the US has paralysed Parliament's winter session. ""I feel it is more important to raise issues relating to farmers, youth and the common people, & to see that these issues are resolved,"" Kolhe said.The MP from Shirur added that they want debate and discussions on basic issues instead of political sloganeering. ""This should be ensured by both governing party and the opposition,"" Kolhe added.Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule, MP from Baramati, was sitting next to Kolhe and nodded in support all through his speech Friday.Trinamool and SP have already voiced their concerns about Congress's stubbornness over raising Adani issue, saying it is stopping them from raising other important issues like Sambhal riots and those related to Bangladesh.Congress had initiated protests inside and outside Parliament on the Adani issue at the beginning of the winter session. But, following misgivings of its allies, it corrected course, and has since been holding protests only outside Parliament.Also, the issue found scant mention during the debate on Constitution, though Rahul Gandhi, LoP in Lok Sabha, made a brief remark during his speech: ""When you give Dharavi to Adani, you chop off the thumb of the small and medium businesses there...You have fired tear gas shells on farmers outside Delhi, the farmers are asking for fair prices...You are cutting the thumb of that farmer.""",Nationalist Congress Party distanced itself from Congress's efforts to attack the govt over its alleged links to the conglomerate.

Allu Arjun spends night in jail despite bail in stampede case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/allu-arjun-spends-night-in-jail-despite-bail-in-stampede-case/articleshow/116301333.cms,"Allu Arjun

Actor's arrest unwarranted, says family who filed plaint



HYDERABAD: Actor Allu Arjun was arrested Friday from his home in Hyderabad's Jubilee Hills and charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder for the death of a 39-year-old mother of two in the Dec 4 stampede at a city theatre hosting the premiere of his new film, Pushpa 2: The Rule , a blockbuster.Telangana high court granted Arjun interim bail till Jan 21 on a bond of Rs 50,000 after a local court remanded him in judicial custody for 14 days. Justice J Sridevi said it was ""unfair"" to hold the actor to account for the stampede when the film's distributors had intimated cops about his presence at the premiere.However, Chanchalguda jail authorities told TOI that the actor would not be released in the night. Amid protests by fans outside, a jail official said Arjun would be released Saturday morning as the bail order had arrived late.The family of Revathi, who died in the stampede, said Arjun was not to blame and they were ready to withdraw the complaint that led police to register a criminal case.Allu Arjun couldn't be legally held responsible for the December 4 stampede at Sandhya Theatre, in which a woman was killed, as police had been duly informed about his presence at the premiere and should have taken adequate precaution, the actor's counsels argued in a packed courtroom in Nampally on Friday.DCP (central zone) Akshansh Yadav had denied on the morning after the stampede that they received an intimation from the theatre on Dec 2. On Dec 8, ACP (Chikadpally division) L Ramesh Kumar iterated that there was ""no prior information "" about Allu Arjun being invited to the theatre.The public prosecutor sought Allu Arjun's judicial remand on the ground that despite police turning down Sandhya Theatre's request, the actor and his entourage turned up, leading to what he said was ""an uncontrollable situation"". Police also accused Allu Arjun of arriving at the theatre in a cavalcade for which there was no prior permission. ""Waving to the people from the open-top car got the crowd excited, with more people joining in and rushing into the theatre,"" the prosecutor said.The prosecution took a similar line during arguments at HC hearing of Allu Arjun's interim bail plea. Prosecutor Palle Nageswara Rao argued against any relief to the actor and requested that he be asked to file for regular bail on December 16.Justice J Sridevi ruled that none of the charges - negligent act leading to death and prior knowledge about the likelihood of such a death, among others - was applicable in this case as police could not present proof of having rejected the theatre's bandobast request.Allu Arjun's counsel Niranjan Reddy cited a Gujarat HC order granting ""instant relief"" to Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan when he was charged with causing a person's death in a stampede during a publicity event for his 2017 film Raees.Justice Sridevi also granted interim bail to the four co-owners of Sandhya Theatre. She asked police to continue their investigation and directed the actor to cooperate with them.The criminal case was filed against the actor, his security team and the management of Sandhya Theatre on the basis of a complaint filed by the family of the victim, Revathi. But the family said the actor's arrest was unwarranted. ""My son wanted to watch 'Pushpa 2', so I took them to the theatre. Allu Arjun was not at fault. I came to know about his arrest from a news portal,"" Revathi's husband Mogadampalli Bhaskar said. Revathi was with her nine-year-old son Sritej when police tried to disperse the swelling premiere-evening crowd jostling for a glimpse of the actor. The boy, a fan of Arjun, was seriously injured in the resultant stampede.The day of drama began around 11.30am when police arrested Allu Arjun from his Jubilee Hills residence. He was taken to Chikadpally police station, by which time hundreds of fans had assembled there. The actor's father, Allu Arvind, a film producer, and other family members trailed the police convoy.The actor waved to his fans and smiled while being taken to Gandhi Hospital later for a medical examination. At 3.30pm, Allu Arjun was produced before the ninth additional chief metropolitan magistrate at Nampally criminal court.The HC relief came moments after Allu Arjun entered Chanchalguda Central Jail, clad in a white hoodie with the film's dialogue, ""flower nahi, fire hei mein"", emblazoned on it. Late Friday, city police said, ""It is beyond our resources to provide bandobast for every event. In specific cases where a heavy crowd is expected or some popular personality is visiting, the organiser personally visits the police station/ACP/DCP office and briefs about the programme, depending upon which we provide the bandobast.""","Actor Allu Arjun was arrested Friday from his home in Hyderabad's Jubilee Hills.

Stampede took place due to alleged poor crowd management, which led to lathicharge.""The theatre management did not make any additional provisions regarding security to manage the crowd nor was there any separate entry or exit for the actors team though the theatre management had information about their arrival,"" the police had said.The authorities had previously arrested three individuals, including a co-partner of the theatre, in connection with this incident.The police had registered a case against Allu Arjun, his security team, and the theatre management under sections 105 and 118(1) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) at the Chikkadpally police station based on the complaint lodged by the deceased woman's family.Arjun had also filed a plea to quash the FIR and requested a stay on all further proceedings, including arrest.","Telangana High Court granted 4 weeks interim bail to actor Allu Arjun on Friday.

From when drones are spotted in New Jersey sky?



Are drones allowed in New Jersey?



Were drones seen in other areas?



Drones spotted over ocean



Growing panic and limited answers



Calls for FAA restrictions and accountability



Theories and speculation



Legal concerns and state action



A national mystery with local consequences



New Jersey State Senator Jon Bramnick is sounding the alarm after a series of mysterious drone sightings near military installations and sensitive sites in the Northeast. Frustrated by the lack of transparency from the US department of defense and state authorities, Bramnick described the situation as escalating into a ""near insanity"" level of uncertainty.Appearing on NewsNation’s Morning in America, he expressed his concerns about the government's response, or lack thereof, saying, ""You think about a United States senator who has to go out with the local police to look for drones . That’s where the United States senator is getting information.""Drone sightings have been a source of growing anxiety among New Jersey residents, with numerous reports of unmanned aerial devices hovering near military facilities, including Picatinny Arsenal, a sensitive research center, and President-elect Donald Trump 's Bedminster golf course. These observations spread across the state, including coastal regions and near critical infrastructure.Despite frequent reports, the department of defense has remained tight-lipped, only stating that the drones do not pose a direct threat to public safety or national security. Bramnick, however, questioned whether the government is withholding information. ""My guess is there is information, but they’re holding it back,"" he said, adding, ""And now what you have is panic… at the next point, somebody is going to do something stupid, so the Department of Defense has to come clean with the American public.""On Thursday, White House national security spokesman John Kirby informed journalists that available evidence indicated many reported drone sightings were actually conventional aircraft. Several politicians have expressed dissatisfaction with the government's response and limited public disclosure.Numerous drone sightings have been documented in New Jersey since November 18, according to regional authorities. Initial observations occurred near the Raritan river, which connects to New Jersey's largest water body, the Round Valley Reservoir, as reported by the Associated Press.Sightings subsequently expanded across the state, including coastal regions. Objects were noticed near sensitive locations, including Picatinny Arsenal and President-elect Donald Trump's Bedminster golf facility.Drones are permitted in New Jersey for both recreational and commercial purposes, though operators must comply with local regulations and FAA guidelines, including specific flight restrictions, AP news agency reported.In New York City, unmanned aircraft operators need a permit for takeoff and landing operations, and FAA certification is mandatory for all drone pilots.Drone sightings have occurred in multiple locations, including Virginia. Near Virginia Beach, two witnesses observed an unusual aircraft on Thursday night. In neighbouring New York City, police confirmed multiple drone sightings over the Bronx on December 12, as reported to CBS News.Law enforcement witnessed the objects overhead, though they quickly vanished. Additional sightings occurred across New York State, according to state police reports.Connecticut authorities confirmed ""suspicious drone activity"" across various locations, implementing detection systems near Groton and New London.Former Maryland Governor Larry Hogan reported witnessing what appeared to be numerous drones above his Davidsonville residence, situated 40km from Washington DC.""Like many who have observed these drones, I do not know if this increasing activity over our skies is a threat to public safety or national security,"" he wrote on X. ""But the public is growing increasingly concerned and frustrated with the complete lack of transparency and the dismissive attitude of the federal government.""One observer, John Knight, recorded footage of what he described as a truck-sized drone moving above the ocean and an Army National Guard facility.Knight noted the aircraft's unique characteristics, stating it moved similarly to a helicopter but produced no sound. The Virginia National Guard confirmed no aircraft operations that night, with spokesperson A.A. ""Cotton"" Puryear indicating an ongoing investigation.Naval Air Station Oceana Dam Neck Annex and NAS Oceana's public affairs officer, Katie Hewett, confirmed on Friday they are working with federal and state agencies regarding the sightings. Knight subsequently submitted his video evidence to the FBI.In Harwich, Massachusetts, residents reported 10 to 15 luminous drones hovering above a residence on Thursday night, with one witness observing them for over an hour. That same evening, an off-duty officer noticed similar activity near a public safety complex. These incidents were reported to the FBI and Massachusetts State Police.Recent drone activity was also documented in the United Kingdom, where the US Air Force identified several small unmanned aircraft near four American-operated military bases in England.The sightings first appeared near the Raritan River, which feeds into New Jersey’s largest water body, Round Valley Reservoir. The drones, described as flying with lights off and in a coordinated manner, have been difficult to track, as confirmed by both local police and state officials. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has imposed temporary flight restrictions in these areas, including over Bedminster and Picatinny, but the sources and operators behind these drones remain unidentified.In a Thursday briefing, White House national security spokesman John Kirby dismissed the claims of drone threats, suggesting that many reported sightings were, in fact, conventional aircraft. However, this has done little to quell public unease. U.S. officials have repeatedly downplayed concerns, asserting that the drones do not appear to be a national security threat, yet the lack of conclusive information is fueling public frustration.Bramnick has called for stricter airspace regulations in New Jersey, urging the FAA to impose comprehensive restrictions on drone operations. He is not alone in his concerns—politicians from various states have criticized the federal government’s lack of transparency. ""The public is growing increasingly concerned and frustrated with the complete lack of transparency and the dismissive attitude of the federal government,"" said former Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who reported seeing drones near his residence.In addition to the mystery in New Jersey, drone sightings have been reported across the US, including in Virginia, New York, Connecticut, and even in the U.K., where drones were seen near American military bases. Former Governor Hogan also questioned whether these sightings were linked to foreign actors, particularly China or Iran, though US officials have dismissed these claims as unsubstantiated.As per reports by BBC, while federal officials continue to insist that there is no evidence to suggest foreign involvement, some lawmakers, like New Jersey Representative Jeff Van Drew, have speculated that the drones could be launched from an Iranian ""mothership"" in the Atlantic. However, the Pentagon swiftly denied these assertions, saying ""There is no truth to that."" Illinois Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, on the other hand, hinted at the possibility of Chinese involvement, noting the high likelihood of data being collected by the drones.While the origins remain unknown, the increasing frequency of sightings has led to calls for stronger measures, including potentially shooting down the drones for investigation. President-elect Trump also suggested shooting down the drones if their operators refuse to identify themselves, stating, ""Let the public know, and now… otherwise, shoot them down.""As the drone mystery deepens, state officials are urging the federal government to take action. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy has called for greater cooperation between federal agencies and local law enforcement to address the growing threat. In a December 13 letter to President Joe Biden, Murphy also pushed for Congress to grant local law enforcement expanded counter-drone capabilities.However, some residents have voiced frustration with the lack of progress and even suggested taking matters into their own hands. Online discussions have seen suggestions that citizens use firearms to disable drones, a notion that authorities strongly discourage as illegal and dangerous.As the investigation continues, the uncertainty surrounding the drone sightings shows no signs of abating. While the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI have emphasized that there is no immediate risk to public safety, the lack of answers is leaving residents and lawmakers increasingly agitated. Until the origins of these mysterious flying objects are determined, the skies over New Jersey—and potentially other parts of the US—will remain a source of both intrigue and concern.","Numerous drone sightings have been documented in New Jersey since November 18.

Syria's Jolani Sends First Direct Message To Putin; 'Rebels Did Not Attack You Because...'

Rebel takeover

In the final, chaotic hours before rebel forces stormed Damascus and ended Bashar al-Assad 's iron-fisted rule, the Syrian president had already fled the country. His departure, shrouded in secrecy, marked the abrupt collapse of his 24-year regime and his family’s 50-year hold over Syria. As the clock ticked towards Sunday morning, Assad had already abandoned his seat of power, leaving behind a disoriented government. His aides were kept in the dark about his plans, with some learning of his departure only after the fact.The final days of Assad’s rule were marked by confusion and secrecy. Rebel forces had launched an offensive in the north of Syria on November 27, and by the end of the month, the regime had lost control of Aleppo . As the rebels moved south, capturing Hama and Homs, Assad remained in Moscow, where his wife was receiving cancer treatment. During this time, he falsely assured his aides that Russian support would come, misleading them into thinking that military assistance would halt the rebels' advance. Meanwhile, a crucial meeting between Assad and his intelligence chiefs was marked by his absence, further fuelling uncertainty among the regime's senior officials.The following Saturday, on the eve of Damascus’s fall, preparations for a speech were made in the presidential palace, news agency AFP reported. Assad’s media adviser was tasked with drafting a speech for a political meeting that was expected to take place the next morning. But by evening, the situation had taken an unexpected turn. Assad, who had requested the speech, stopped answering calls, and his media director, Kamel Sakr, also went silent. By 2am on Sunday, as rebel forces neared the capital, Assad’s government apparatus began to disintegrate. Security forces and top officials abandoned their posts, with soldiers fleeing the capital, leaving Damascus eerily empty. The government had lost control.As panic set in, a palace official recounts the chaos of the final hours: ""We didn’t even know if the president was still at the palace. It was unimaginable that he had already left,"" a palace official told AFP.Assad's sudden departure, alongside the collapse of his military forces, paved the way for the insurgents’ swift entry into Damascus. By Sunday morning, the rebels had taken control of the capital, marking the end of Assad’s decades-long dictatorship. Despite the speed of their victory, the insurgents were conscious of the need to reassure a population scarred by years of war. As crowds gathered in the streets, some insurgent fighters sought to calm fears of extremist rule. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the group leading the charge, has promised to create an inclusive government, but concerns over their past ties to extremist groups lingered among many Syrians.Meanwhile, international powers quickly scrambled to shape Syria’s transition. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken held talks with regional allies, urging the formation of a non-sectarian interim government.","Bashar al-Assad fled the country in the final hours before rebel forces stormed Damascus.

Mystery Drones Spotted Over Trump's Golf Course, U.S. Military Research Site In New Jersey

Federal officials revealed on Saturday that most recent drone sightings across the Northeast are actually manned aircraft , according to their investigations. The White House, FBI, and Department of Homeland Security have also stated there is no evidence of a national security threat .An FBI official briefed reporters, explaining the agency is collaborating with 50 local, state, and federal partners to investigate the increased reports. Of over 5,000 reported sightings, less than 100 warranted further investigation. All large, fixed-wing sightings investigated so far have been identified as manned aircraft.""The combination of efforts so far ... to include technical equipment, tip line information and noted consults has ... not found any evidence to support large-scale (unmanned aerial systems) activities,"" the official said, as quoted by Reuters, noting many sightings occurred along established flight paths. Officials continue to investigate remaining cases using interviews, radar analysis, and intelligence.""We can't ignore the sightings that have been there,"" the official added. ""We're doing our best to find the origin of those drone activities, but I think there has been a slight over-reaction.""The Department of Homeland security in a joint statement with the FBI have also took a similar stance. ""Historically, we have experienced cases of mistaken identity, where reported drones are, in fact, manned aircraft or facilities,” the agencies said.Last week, Biden's national security spokesperson John F Kirby also indicated that their investigation revealed no unlawful actions. ""To the contrary, upon review of available imagery, it appears that many of the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft that are being operated lawfully,"" Kirby had said on Thursday.Reports began in mid-November in New Jersey and spread to Maryland, Massachusetts, and other states. President Biden is receiving regular updates on the situation. Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey acknowledged awareness of the sightings and is monitoring the situation. New York Governor Kathy Hochul called for increased federal law enforcement after a local airport briefly closed Friday due to drone activity.A Federal Aviation Administration official said a temporary drone ban over Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, expiring December 26, could become permanent. A military official confirmed drone sightings over Picatinny and another naval weapons station but said there was no indication of foreign involvement or malicious intent. Another temporary ban is in effect over Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, expiring December 20, with possible extension.","Federal officials say most recent drone sightings across the Northeast are actually manned aircraft.

President-elect Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he has picked Richard Grenell , a long-term foreign policy expert, as the envoy for special missions.Trump announced Grenell’s appointment on Saturday via Truth Social. “Ric will work in some of the hottest spots around the World, including Venezuela and North Korea ,” Trump said, without detailing specific responsibilities.According to Reuters sources close to the Trump transition the Balkans will also be a focus for Grenell.Grenell previously served as ambassador to Germany and special envoy for Serbia and Kosovo peace negotiations under the Trump administration. He also briefly held the position of acting director of national intelligence.After departing from his official role in 2021, Grenell maintained a strong connection with Trump, offering guidance particularly on international affairs. During Trump's meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in September, Grenell was present. He has supported a diplomatic resolution that would protect Ukraine 's sovereignty whilst establishing ""autonomous regions"" under Russian influence.Additionally, he shares Trump's stance against Ukraine's Nato membership, contending that the alliance should not welcome new members until existing ones fulfil their defence spending commitments. Despite longstanding agreements for NATO members to allocate 2% of their GDP towards defence, numerous countries have yet to achieve this threshold.Following Grenell's campaign support for Trump before the November 5 election, he was considered for secretary of state, ultimately awarded to US Senator Marco Rubio. He was also in contention for special envoy for the Ukraine war, a position given to retired lieutenant general Keith Kellogg.As a supporter, Grenell organised several gatherings centred on economic policies and national security matters for the Republican candidate. During his address at the Republican National Convention, he reinforced Trump's signature message that ""it's time to put America first"" in international affairs, whilst asserting that both China and Russia perceived President Joe Biden's leadership as ineffective.In Michigan, Grenell played a significant role in Trump's outreach to Arab American voters, a traditionally Democratic-leaning group, despite Trump's previous restrictions on immigration from predominantly Muslim nations. He coordinated several pro-Trump gatherings with Arab American communities, including an assembly in Troy, Michigan in May.Trump is set to take office next month. The creation of special envoy positions is a common presidential practice for addressing specific global issues and diplomatic efforts.","Richard Grenell is a long-term foreign policy expert.

Legal dispute and settlement terms

Context of the claims

ABC News has agreed to pay $15 million to US President-elect Donald Trump’s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over inaccurate remarks made by anchor George Stephanopoulos..The lawsuit stemmed from Stephanopoulos’ claim during a March 10 broadcast of ‘This Week’ that Trump had been found civilly liable for raping writer E Jean Carroll, a statement that mischaracterized the legal findings in Carroll’s lawsuits against Trump.The settlement, made public on Saturday, also includes a $1 million payment to cover Trump’s legal fees and a public apology from ABC News. The network will post a note on its website expressing regret for the error, according to court documents.Trump’s lawsuit, filed in March in the US District Court for Southern Florida, accused Stephanopoulos and ABC News of defamation, alleging the comments were made with malice and recklessness. The settlement specifies that ABC must publish a correction by Sunday, reading, ""ABC News and George Stephanopoulos regret statements regarding President Donald J Trump made during an interview by George Stephanopoulos with Rep Nancy Mace on ABC's This Week on March 10, 2024.""In its statement, ABC News said: “We are pleased that the parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing.”The controversy centres on Stephanopoulos’ assertion, made during an interview with Rep Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), that Trump was “found liable for rape.” The claim misrepresented the findings in two civil lawsuits brought by Carroll.In 2023, a jury held Trump liable for sexually assaulting Carroll and defaming her, awarding her $5 million in damages. Earlier this year, he was found liable on additional defamation claims and ordered to pay $83.3 million. Trump has denied the allegations and is appealing both verdicts.As per Reuters, neither case involved a finding of rape under New York’s legal definition. Judge Lewis Kaplan clarified that the jury determined Carroll had not proven rape “within the narrow, technical meaning of a particular section of the New York Penal Law.”However, Kaplan acknowledged the term “rape” is often understood more broadly in common usage and other contexts.",ABC News has agreed to pay $15 million to US President-elect Donald Trump’s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over inaccurate remarks made by anchor George Stephanopoulos.

How Donald Trump sent his son's 'ex-fiancée' Kimberly Guilfoyle to Greece as Bettina Anderson sparks love triangle gossip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-donald-trump-sent-his-sons-ex-fiance-kimberly-guilfoyle-to-greece-as-bettina-anderson-sparks-love-triangle-gossip/articleshow/116203694.cms,"Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle

US President-elect Donald Trump made a flurry of job announcements on Wednesday, including the selection of Kimberly Guilfoyle as ambassador to Greece . However, the timing of this appointment was anything but ordinary, coming amid a storm of tabloid gossip surrounding his son Donald Trump Jr 's relationship status.Guilfoyle, who had been dating Trump Jr since 2018 and got engaged to him in 2020, found herself in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. The day earlier, British tabloid The Daily Mail published photos of Trump Jr with socialite Bettina Anderson , igniting rumors that he had moved on with a new love interest.The outlet described the images as ""incontrovertible proof"" that Trump Jr had ""moved on"" with the ""stunning 'it girl.'""And so, as his son’s rumored new romance heated up, Donald Trump reportedly sent his son’s 'ex-fiancée' to Greece. The timing of Guilfoyle’s appointment as ambassador could hardly be more dramatic, adding layers to the gossip surrounding the love triangle.Despite the swirling rumors, Guilfoyle’s appointment was met with a glowing endorsement from Trump, who called her ""a close friend and ally"" with “extensive experience and leadership.” However, his Truth Social post made no mention of her relationship with his son, nor did it address the tabloid storm brewing around her and Trump Jr’s alleged breakup.The whispers about the love triangle have been brewing for months.As per the report by NYT, in July, Anderson raised eyebrows at the Republican National Convention , where she sat conspicuously close to Trump Jr and Guilfoyle, clad in a striking red dress. And just last September, reports surfaced of Trump Jr and Anderson sharing a kiss during brunch — adding fuel to the speculation, especially since Anderson was once friends with Trump Jr’s ex-wife, Vanessa Trump.Further intrigue followed when Guilfoyle was notably absent from a postelection family photo, which featured Vanessa, her five children with Trump Jr, and even Elon Musk. The missing fiancée fueled chatter about the couple’s relationship status.Meanwhile, Anderson stirred the pot this week with an Instagram post showcasing a lavish bouquet and a note reading, ""Many have said that you're aging out but I think you're perfect."" Her caption? ""Tough but fair."" Observers were quick to spot Trump Jr's Instagram handle tagged in the post.Anderson, who hails from a prominent Palm Beach family and leads a conservation nonprofit, poked fun at her public image, describing herself online as a “typical stay-at-home mom” who “doesn’t do household chores … or have a husband … or have kids,” reported NYT.When asked about the love triangle rumors , a spokesperson for President-elect Trump dismissed them as “very sexist,” emphasizing that Guilfoyle’s selection was based on her qualifications.Guilfoyle herself shared her excitement about the role, saying she looks forward to “delivering on the Trump agenda, supporting our Greek allies, and ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity.”Trump Jr also chimed in, saying he was “so proud of Kimberly” and confident she would “be an amazing leader.” Whether he’ll join her in Greece remains unanswered, leaving the tabloids to speculate further.For now, all eyes are on Guilfoyle as she steps onto the global stage, carrying both her new diplomatic role and the weight of swirling headlines.","Kimberly Guilfoyle was named ambassador to Greece on Wednesday.

What is the Luigi Mangione '286 Conspiracy Theory'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-luigi-mangione-286-conspiracy-theory/articleshow/116176938.cms,"The Case: The Murder of Brian Thompson



Details of the Crime



Mangione’s Arrest



Key Connections to the Number 286







Timeline of Events



The ""286 conspiracy theory"" centers on the alleged connections between Luigi Mangione—a suspect in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson—and the number 286. Internet sleuths have identified several supposed links between this number and various aspects of Mangione’s life, actions, and the murder, fueling speculation about deeper meanings or intentions.On December 7, 2024, Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was fatally shot outside a Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan. Surveillance footage captured a masked gunman fleeing the scene, described by witnesses as wearing dark clothing and carrying a concealed weapon. The attack occurred at approximately 9:15 PM as Thompson exited a private dinner event. The gunman fired multiple shots, striking Thompson in the chest and abdomen. Despite immediate emergency response, Thompson was pronounced dead upon arrival at a nearby hospital.Thompson was a significant figure in the corporate healthcare industry, known for leading cost-cutting measures and streamlining insurance policies. While these efforts were celebrated by some in the corporate world, they also attracted criticism from activists and patients who felt neglected by the healthcare system.The weapon used in the murder was a ghost gun, an untraceable firearm assembled from unregulated parts. This type of weapon, favored by those seeking to avoid detection, was later discovered among Mangione’s possessions. Witness accounts and surveillance footage showed the suspect fleeing north on foot in a calculated manner, leading authorities to believe the crime was premeditated. Investigators connected Mangione to the murder using ballistic evidence, digital footprints, and his documented animosity toward the corporate healthcare sector.Two days after the murder, on December 9, 2024, Mangione was arrested at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He was found in possession of a ghost gun similar to the one used in the murder, a three-page handwritten manifesto detailing his grievances against corporate America, and forged identification documents. Investigators determined that Mangione had fled Manhattan immediately after the crime, using cash and burner phones to evade capture.The number 286 has emerged as a recurring element in the investigation, with internet sleuths drawing various connections. One notable link is the Pokémon Breloom, which holds the Pokédex number 286. This Pokémon featured prominently in Mangione’s X (formerly Twitter) account banner, leading some to speculate that it was chosen intentionally.Some have tied the number to Proverbs 28:6, a Bible verse stating, “Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity than a rich man who is crooked in his ways.” This verse has been interpreted as reflective of Mangione’s disdain for corporate greed and figures like Thompson. Furthermore, in healthcare billing, denial code 286 refers to claims denied due to failure to meet appeal deadlines—a symbolic connection given Mangione’s documented criticism of the healthcare system.On December 7, 2024, Brian Thompson was fatally shot outside the Hilton hotel in Manhattan. Surveillance footage captured the gunman fleeing the scene. The following day, police identified Mangione as a person of interest based on digital evidence and previous anti-corporate statements. On December 9, Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where he was charged with weapons possession and forgery. Authorities began preparing murder charges based on ballistic evidence and Mangione’s manifesto. On December 10, Mangione appeared in court, and prosecutors revealed his potential motivations and ties to the healthcare industry.The Luigi Mangione ""286 conspiracy theory"" hinges on the idea that a single number ties together various elements of a murder case, reflecting either deliberate symbolism or an unusual string of coincidences. While the significance of 286 remains speculative, the case has captivated public interest, demonstrating how patterns—real or imagined—can influence the narratives of high-profile investigations.","The ""286 conspiracy theory"" centers on the alleged connections between Luigi Mangione and the number 286.

The runways reopened at 10:45 pm, and, according to a spokesperson, no flights were impacted during the brief closure.Governor Kathy Hochul , who confirmed the closure on Saturday, expressed frustration over the frequent disruptions caused by drones in the state.

Hochul also urged the Biden Administration to address the increasing frequency of drone sightings in New York, as concerns mount about their potential impact on public safety and infrastructure.The ongoing investigations into the drone sightings, which have been reported across New York and surrounding states, have prompted a joint statement from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).On Thursday, the agencies confirmed that they had found no evidence suggesting that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or public safety threat. The statement emphasized that there have been instances of mistaken identity, where reported drones were later confirmed to be manned aircraft.""We have not corroborated any of the reported visual sightings with electronic detection,"" the joint statement read. ""Upon review of available imagery, it appears that many of the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft, operating lawfully."" The statement also noted that there were no confirmed drone sightings in restricted airspace.Despite this, authorities continue to investigate the situation with the help of local law enforcement and advanced detection methods. The agencies reaffirmed their commitment to investigating the reports but stressed that no malicious activity has been uncovered at this stage.The drone sightings have raised alarms, particularly in neighboring New Jersey, where the State Police have been investigating similar reports since November 18. Governor Phil Murphy has called for additional resources to support the investigation and urged Congress to renew the federal government’s counter-UAS powers to improve the response to such incidents.In response to the growing number of incidents, President-elect Donald Trump also addressed the issue on Friday night, calling for greater transparency in the ongoing investigations. He suggested that if the drones posed a threat, they should be shot down, accusing the Biden administration of withholding crucial information.","Stewart International Airport in New York was temporarily closed on Friday night after a reported drone sighting. The Federal Aviation Administration reported the sighting around 9:40 pm, prompting the Port Authority to shut down the airport's runways.

Did Donald Trump salute too soon? US President-elect's gesture during Anthem at Army-Navy game sparks debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-donald-trump-salute-too-soon-us-president-elects-gesture-during-anthem-at-army-navy-game-sparks-debate/articleshow/116329255.cms,"A salute that divided opinion



Supporters rally behind Trump



Tradition of saluting at Army-Navy



A symbolic moment for Trump



US President-elect Donald Trump sparked a heated debate online after saluting during the national anthem at the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium in Landover, Maryland, on Saturday. Attending the game with vice president-elect JD Vance, house speaker Mike Johnson, and defence secretary nominee Pete Hegseth, Trump’s gesture quickly went viral, with social media users questioning whether it was appropriate.As the anthem began, Trump raised a salute from the VIP box, while others around him, including Vance and Hegseth, placed their hands over their hearts. Military protocol dictates that saluting is typically reserved for those in uniform or active-duty personnel. As the President-elect, Trump remains a civilian until his inauguration on January 20, 2025. Critics argued that the gesture was out of place, while supporters hailed it as a sign of patriotism.One user on X (formerly Twitter) remarked, “All persons NOT in uniform should stand at attention, face the flag, and place their right hand over their heart. Trump isn’t in uniform. Read the flag code!” Another pointed out that President Joe Biden , the current Commander-in-Chief, is the one with authority to salute the military, adding that Trump’s action blurred the line between civilian and military roles.On the other hand, Trump’s supporters flooded social media with praise. A video shared by a user read, “DonaldTrump salutes during the national anthem. Joe Biden didn’t go for the past four years. Great to have the president back at Army-Navy.”Another user quipped, “I’m surprised Biden never went. According to his speeches, he probably claims he played for both Army and Navy in the same game!”Military tradition holds that civilians should place their hand over their heart during the anthem, reserving salutes for those in uniform. While there is no legal prohibition against civilians saluting, it is considered unusual and, by some, disrespectful to military personnel.The Army-Navy game has historically been a stage for presidents and public figures to honor the military. Trump, no stranger to using high-profile appearances to energize his base, appeared to frame the event as a symbolic nod to his upcoming presidency. His presence at the game, alongside Republican heavyweights, was part of a broader effort to project unity and strength ahead of his inauguration.","US President-elect Donald Trump sparked a heated debate online after saluting during the national anthem at the 125th Army-Navy football game.

Pakistan's federal investigation agency (FIA) has initiated legal action against over 150 individuals, including journalists and vloggers, for allegedly spreading false information about a recent protest crackdown and maligning security agencies. The investigation focuses on claims regarding the November 26 protest involving Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters in Islamabad.“The FIA has registered a case against dozens of suspects, including journalists and vloggers, for their involvement in maligning security agencies over the Nov 26 incident. Harmeet Singh, a Sikh journalist, is also among them,"" an FIA official confirmed to Pakistani outlet Dawn.Over 20 individuals have been arrested so far, accused of sharing controversial social media posts about alleged deaths during the crackdown.

The accused are alleged to have spread false information about the events between November 24 and 27, inciting violence against state institutions. Those named include journalists Harmeet Singh, Ahmad Noorani, and several social media activists.The government said that law enforcement did not open fire on protesters and has vowed to take action against anyone spreading misinformation.Amnesty International has called for a transparent investigation into the incident, saying, “Yet again, protesters in Pakistan have faced a brutal and lethal crackdown shrouded in callous opacity by the authorities.” They added, “Urgent and transparent investigation is needed into the deadly crackdown on protesters. We demand a prompt, thorough, impartial, effective, and transparent investigation into the deaths and injuries of protesters.”The PTI organised the November 26 march in Islamabad to protest against former Pakistan PM Imran Khan's detention, defying a ban on public gatherings. Clashes broke out between protesters and security forces, with authorities using tear gas to disperse the crowd.","Pakistan's federal investigation agency has initiated legal action against over 150 individuals, including journalists and vloggers.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in last year’s May 9 riots when protesters linked to the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) had stormed govt and military installations.A seven-member SC constitution bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin, specified that the military court verdicts would be subject to its final decision on appeals against its Oct 23, 2023 ruling barring the army from trying PTI protesters, saying military trials of civilians were unconstitutional.Local and international human rights organisations have expressed concern about the military trials, claiming that they do not adhere to the same evidentiary and due process norms as civilian courtsHundreds of PTI workers were arrested after they purportedly stormed military and govt buildings, and even torched a top commander’s house, following the former PM’s brief arrest by paramilitary soldiers on May 9, 2023 in a graft case. Among the detainees, the army initiated military trials against 103 accused on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military. Though Khan was released after three days, he was rearrested two months later in another corruption case and has been in jail since. There have been widespread reports that the military also plans to prosecute him under the same charges. He, however, has already been indicted by an anti-terrorism court over charges linked to the May 9 riots.The seven-member SC constitution bench was formed as a result of a controversial amendment to the constitution in Oct this year.“The final judgment of 85 persons who are under custody and facing trial before the military courts be announced and remissions admissible to the said persons be granted, and persons who can be released after remissions they be released forthwith, and persons who have to yet undergo the sentence awarded to them, their custody be handed over to the concerned jail authorities,” Friday’s court order read.The Pakistan Army Act of 1952 had established military courts, which function under a separate legal system, primarily for trial of military personnel or enemies of the state.The decision to use military courts for civilians was taken by Imran’sadversary, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during his first term in office, and was backed by the powerful military establishment.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in May 9 riots.

Bin Laden, Tehran and the Taliban



'Murdered my dreams'



PARACHINAR: Once again, Ali Ghulam receives mourners at his home -- his brother and nephew killed 40 years apart in the same sectarian conflict that was reignited this year in northwest Pakistan, claiming 200 lives since July alone.Thousands of residents are stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district, which borders Afghanistan, as the government struggles to end clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stemming from decades-old tensions over farmland.""Our generations yearn for peace,"" 72-year-old Ghulam told AFP at his home in Parachinar, the main town and a Shiite bastion of the restive district.The latest flare-up of violence has ""reopened wounds"" he said, recalling how his brother was killed in an attack in 1987 that also wounded another three of his brothers.Kurram, known as the ""Parrot's Beak"" for its protrusion into neighbouring Afghanistan, is bounded by dizzyingly high mountains, the northern flank of which includes the Tora Bora caves where Al Qaeda founder and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden once hid.Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for various militant groups, with militants and weapons able to flow largely unchecked in and out of Afghanistan.""I have never experienced peace in my life and have no hope my coming generations will live free of fear,"" Ghulam said.Tribal and family feuds are common in Pakistan.But they can be particularly protracted and violent in the mountainous tribal northwest, where communities live by traditional codes of honour and revenge.The latest round of violence in Kurram erupted in May and intensified in July, when gunmen opened fire on a council of elders attempting to settle the latest round of disagreements over land.Various truces announced since then have held for only weeks or days at a time.More than 300 shops and over 200 homes in Sunni areas have been destroyed, often by fire, and hundreds of families have fled.Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country with Shiites making up 10 to 15 percent of the population, or at least 25 million people.Members of the two sects have periodically clashed in Kurram, where Shiites are particularly vulnerable as they must pass through Sunni-majority neighbourhoods to access essential services.Kurram's location on the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan put it at the heart of the religious and political upheavals of the last five decades.In 1979, Shiites led a revolution in Iran and later that year the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, prompting Sunni hardliners there to rise up against them.Pakistan's military ruler Zia-ul-Haq aligned with them, funnelling thousands of Sunni militants into Afghanistan through Kurram.""It became a hub for arms supply to Afghanistan, including landmines, mortar shells, and weapons of all kinds. Every household in Kurram had a stockpile of weapons,"" Malik Attaullah Khan, a local tribal elder told AFP.Khan, who signed a 2007 agreement aimed at bringing peace to Kurram, criticised the government for failing to ""fulfil in its responsibilities"" in enforcing land settlements.The ethnic Pashtun heartland was merged into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in 2018, but the Pakistani state maintains limited control in the merged districts.In rural areas of Pakistan, villages often bypass the formal justice system and men-only ""jirgas"" or councils made up of respected village elders resolve disputes, sometimes in the form of fines or land reallocation.Ghulam's nephew was killed along with at least 42 others last month, when Sunni gunmen opened fire on a convoy of Shiites being escorted by the police to their homes.In retaliation, a market in a Sunni-dominated area was set on fire.Syed Ghani Shah told AFP his cousin was burned to death inside his shop.""When we buried him, he was so unrecognisable that we couldn't even let his parents see his face,"" Shah said.""Can we ever make peace after all this? Never, if we ever get the chance, we will surely avenge our blood,"" he warned.Authorities have enforced curfews and road closures to reduce the chances of violence breaking out, providing escorts through high-risk areas and using helicopters to deliver supplies.But Akbar Khan, a representative of Pakistan's independent Human Rights Commission told AFP that the state needs to do more to resolve the issue.""In the past, jirgas were successful because they had the full support of the state. Now, the authorities don't even provide the expenses needed to hold a jirga,"" he said.Fatima Ahmed's husband was killed last month while travelling to Islamabad to arrange her admission to medical college.""I don't want to live a life without him. I've lost my will to exist,"" the 21-year-old told AFP.""They haven't just martyred my husband -- they've also murdered my dreams with him,"" she said, bursting into tears.",Violence in northwest Pakistan has killed 200 people since July.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges, including engaging in political activities and violating a law on official secrets, during field general court martial (FGCM) proceedings against him, military's media affairs wing said Tuesday.Army's media arm ISPR said FGCM also charged Hameed with compromising state security and interests, abusing authority and resources and causing undue harm to individuals. ISPR said proceedings against Hameed were initiated on Aug 12 under provisions of Pakistan Army Act.Hameed, who served as ISI director-general from June 2019 to Oct 2021, was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. He was arrested over accusations about his involvement in land grabbing and snatching valuables and property from the owner of a private housing society. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable in a country where powerful generals have long wielded unparalleled influence in state affairs.""During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (Retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading up to multiple incidents including but not limited to the May 9, 2023 incident for fomenting instability, at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,"" ISPR said. The May 9 incident referred to countrywide protests when PTI supporters stormed army installations and govt buildings following the arrest of party chief and ex-PM Imran Khan for alleged graft. To many, Hameed's close association with Khan was the reason behind his arrest. Khan wanted to continue with Hameed as ISI head but then army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had been adamant on replacing him. Bajwa eventually succeeded and Khan could serve only a few months in office; he was later removed through a no-confidence.Independent observers say action against Hameed could put Khan under pressure and pave the way for the ex-PM to face a military court on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military.","Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries.

Growing threat from Baloch separatists

Sectarian violence fuels instability

Border tensions and counterterrorism efforts

What lies ahead

Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month, according to a report by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). The number of fatalities also surged by 69%, climbing from 100 in October to 169, with 225 others injured.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a banned group, carried out 12 attacks in November, including three high-impact incidents that resulted in 45 deaths. These figures surpassed the fatalities caused by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), indicating a shift in the BLA's operational strategy. Experts suggest this escalation requires a reassessment of counterterrorism tactics.The majority of these attacks in Balochistan targeted security forces and civilians. Notable incidents included an assault on the Quetta railway station, an attack on a police van in Mastung, and a strike on a security check-post in Kalat, which collectively accounted for 91% of the province’s fatalities.Sectarian violence added another layer to the country's security challenges, particularly in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Seven incidents, including two terror attacks and five sectarian clashes, claimed 115 lives and left 137 injured. The violence was triggered by an attack on passenger buses on November 21, which spiraled into broader sectarian unrest.KP remained the most affected province, with 41 terrorist attacks leading to 114 deaths and 95 injuries. The TTP, Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-i-Islam, and other local factions were linked to most of these incidents.The report also highlighted six incidents of border violence along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, resulting in 25 terrorist deaths and 11 injuries. This underscores the ongoing instability in the region and the challenges posed by cross-border insurgents.Security forces conducted 19 counterterrorism operations in November, killing 53 terrorists. Most of these operations were concentrated in KP and Balochistan, the epicenters of recent violence.The PIPS report paints a grim picture of Pakistan's security landscape, with 98 conflict-related incidents causing 338 deaths and 411 injuries in November alone. Experts suggest that the evolving nature of terror threats, including the increasing lethality of BLA operations and persistent sectarian tensions, requires urgent and innovative policy responses.As Pakistan grapples with these challenges, the question remains: can the state adapt quickly enough to address the multifaceted threats destabilizing the country?","Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month. The number of fatalities also surged by 69%, climbing from 100 in October to 169, with 225 others injured. Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a banned group, carried out 12 attacks, including three high-impact incidents that resulted in 45 deaths.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116040661,imgsize-12402,width-400,resizemode-4/116040661.jpg"
Ousted Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina involved in forced disappearances: Interim government's commission,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/ousted-bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasina-involved-in-forced-disappearance-interim-governments-commission/articleshow/116329897.cms,"""Unfolding the Truth,""

(With agency input)

NEW DELHI: An inquiry commission in Bangladesh said on Saturday that deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, along with high-ranking officials of her government, were involved in alleged incidents of enforced disappearances. The commission, set up by the interim government of Muhammad Yunus, implicated Hasina in as many as 3,500 cases of forced disappearances.""The commission has found evidence of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's involvement as the instructor in the incidents of enforced disappearances,"" Muhammad Yunus' government said in a statement on Saturday.The report, titledpresented preliminary evidence against Hasina, who fled the country following a student-led uprising.The statement also claimed that many high-ranking officials, including former military and police personnel believed to be involved, fled abroad after the fall of Hasina's Awami League government on August 5.The investigative commission, informed the interim government that their inquiries uncovered a ""systematic design"" that enabled incidents of enforced disappearances to occur unnoticed.Further, it said that the elite anti-crime unit, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB)—comprising personnel from the army, navy, air force, and regular police—along with other law enforcement agencies, had collaborated to detain, torture, and hold victims in secret facilities.On these lines, the commission recommended abolishing the RAB and called for either repealing or significantly amending the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2009 .In a prior press briefing, the commission disclosed the existence of eight secret detention centers in and around Dhaka. They informed Yunus that they would issue another interim report in March and estimated it would take at least another year to thoroughly investigate all the allegations received.""You are doing an exceptionally important job. We are fully prepared to offer you any support you need,"" Yunus was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.","An inquiry commission in Bangladesh said on Saturday that deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, along with high-ranking officials of her government, were involved in alleged incidents of enforced disappearances.

Taliban minister killed in Kabul suicide bombing in ministry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-minister-killed-in-kabul-suicide-bombing-in-ministry/articleshow/116223724.cms,"Khalil-ur-Rehman Haqqani (Reuters file photo)

ISLAMABAD: Afghan Taliban acting minister for refugees and repatriation Khalil-ur-Rehman Haqqani was killed along with four others in a suicide bombing inside his ministry’s building in central Kabul on Wednesday, Taliban authorities said.This is the first time a high-profile sitting minister has been killed since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in August 2021. Khalil (58) was a key member of the Haqqani network , which led a violent insurgency against the US and its allies before the American withdrawal in 2021. He was the brother of the late Jalaluddin Haqqani, founder of the Haqqani network, and the uncle of incumbent interior (home) minister Sirajuddin Haqqani.No group had claimed responsibility for the attack at the time of going to press but Taliban officials face opposition from ISKP (Islamic State Khurasan Province), and from the National Resistance Front, an anti-Taliban movement led by former officials of the previous toppled Afghan government.CNN quoted a ministry spokesperson as saying a suicide bomber disguised as a visitor had gained access to the building and had detonated the bomb while Haqqani was signing paperwork.In the early days of the takeover, Khalil was one of the key figures who had engaged with other Afghan leaders, including former president Hamid Karzai, ex-chief executive Abdullah Abdullah and Hizb-e-Islami chief Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.“We have received with great sadness the news that the minister of refugees of the Islamic Emirate, Khalil-ur-Rahman Haqqani, was martyred this afternoon in a barbaric attack by the Kharijites (enemies),” said a statement issued by Kabul police, adding that four others were also killed in the explosion. According to reports from Kabul, the death toll could escalate as several people have been admitted to local hospitals.Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban administration’s chief spokesman, said Haqqani was killed in an explosion at the ministry of refugees and repatriation in Kabul. Mujahid said that “infidels” who claim to be Muslims were responsible for Wednesday’s attack. In a post on ‘X’, he called the killing an “irreparable loss to the Islamic Emirate”, using the Taliban’s official name for Afghanistan.Speaking to TOI, Afghan journalist Nur Rehman Sherzad said Haqqani’s assassination took place in one of the most secure places under his supervision. “Since it would be difficult to break the ministry’s strong security, it is likely that someone from his inner circle, or with their participation, carried out the attack,” Sherzad added.Mujahid cited a US reward of up to $5 million for information on Khalil Haqqani, who it had classified as a specially designated global terrorist in 2011, but he did not explicitly blame the US authorities for his apparent assassination. The Taliban spokesperson vowed that such cowardly acts would not weaken the resolve of Muslims nor help the conspirators achieve their “evil goals” against their Islamic system. Instead, he said, such actions only darken the faces of the enemies of Islam and expose their malicious intentions.Although the Haqqanis have long held sway inside the Taliban, they recently seemed to lose ground due to rumours of a falling out between Sirajuddin Haqqani and Taliban regime head Hibatullah Akhundzada.",Khalil-ur-Rehman Haqqani was killed along with four others in a suicide bombing inside his ministry’s building in central Kabul.

He also criticized Western nations for not accommodating halal food in their restaurants, which he described as a double standard.The rally comes amid heightened communal tensions in Bangladesh.

His final official photograph captured him attending a meeting led by deputy prime minister Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar earlier that day.Khalil Haqqani was related to Sirajuddin Haqqani , the acting interior minister, as his uncle. Sirajuddin leads an influential network within the Taliban structure.Since the Taliban's return to power, Haqqani has been the highest-ranking casualty and the first Cabinet member to lose his life. No organisation immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.Zabihullah Mujahid, the government's primary spokesperson, posted on X that Haqqani's passing represented a significant loss, describing him as a dedicated religious warrior who devoted his life to defending Islam.According to Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center's South Asia Institute, Haqqani's death could be the most substantial setback for the Taliban since regaining power, considering his position and influence. This incident occurs whilst the Taliban attempts to establish legitimacy through maintaining peace after years of conflict.""The killing of a top Haqqani leader inside one of its own ministries undercuts that core narrative,"" he said.Former president Hamid Karzai and the minister's nephew, Anas, expressed their condolences. Taliban security forces restricted access to the explosion site and prohibited photography.Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar denounced the incident as a ""terrorist attack.""""Pakistan unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,"" Dar said, noting his government's communication with Kabul for additional information.The Islamic State group's affiliate, a significant Taliban adversary, has previously conducted attacks throughout Afghanistan.In early September, their suicide bomber killed at least six people and injured 13 others in southwestern Kabul.Since the Taliban's August 2021 takeover and the withdrawal of US and Nato forces, suicide attacks have become less frequent. These attacks have primarily targeted Shiite Muslim minorities, particularly in the capital.Ibraheem Bahiss, an analyst with Crisis Group's South Asia programme, noted the attack's timing coincided with Sirajuddin Haqqani's recent speech criticising the Taliban leader's authoritarian approach and lack of consensus, particularly regarding women's and girls' policies.Although the timing might suggest internal involvement, Bahiss dismissed the likelihood of Taliban civil conflict.""They don't want to ruin their hold on power. They are the most unified political force in Afghanistan and have been able to manage their differences."" Bahiss anticipated increased support for Sirajuddin Haqqani, potentially strengthening the Haqqani network 's position.",Taliban refugee minister Khalil Ur-Rahman Haqqani killed in suicide bombing.

He previously served as director of sharia education in Salvation Govt's ministry of religious endowments, and held a senior role in the ministry of development and humanitarian affairs.
