"‘It was Indian military action’: Jaishankar denies US role in ceasefire with Pakistan, says 'draw your conclusions' on China link",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/it-was-indian-military-action-jaishankar-denies-us-role-in-ceasefire-with-pakistan-says-draw-you-conclusions-on-china-link/articleshow/121423798.cms,"NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar has firmly rejected claims that the United States played a decisive role in brokering the recent ceasefire between India and Pakistan, asserting instead that it was India’s military response that forced Islamabad to halt hostilities. In an interview with German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Jaishankar also raised concerns over Pakistan’s close defence ties with China, encouraging observers to ""draw your own conclusions.""“The cessation of firing was agreed between the military commanders of both sides through direct contact,” Jaishankar said. “The morning before, we effectively hit and incapacitated Pakistan's main airbases and air defence system. So who should I thank for the cessation of hostilities? I thank the Indian military because it was the Indian military action that made Pakistan say: We are ready to stop.”Pushing back against suggestions that the standoff during Operation Sindoor brought the nuclear-armed neighbours close to atomic conflict, Jaishankar called such claims baseless and alarmist.“Very, very far away. I’m frankly astonished by your question,” he said when asked how close the world was to nuclear war.“We had terrorist targets. Those were very measured, carefully considered and non-escalating steps. After that, the Pakistani military opened fire on us. We were able to show them that we could disable their air defence systems. Then the firing stopped at their request.”He criticised what he called the West’s persistent tendency to frame South Asian conflicts as potential nuclear flashpoints. “Anything that happens in South Asia is promptly linked to a nuclear crisis by the West,” he said, calling the narrative “disturbing” and warning that it inadvertently “encourages terrible activities like terrorism.”On Pakistan’s continued support for terrorism, Jaishankar said: “Anyone who is not blind can see that the terrorist organisations are openly operating from the cities and towns of Pakistan... In Pakistan, terrorism is a very open business. A business that is supported, financed, organised and used by the state. And by their military.”When asked about China's involvement in the India-Pakistan dynamic, Jaishankar pointed to Islamabad’s defence dependency on Beijing. “Many of the weapons systems that Pakistan has are of Chinese origin and the two countries are very close. You can draw your own conclusions from that,” he said.Jaishankar’s remarks were part of a wide-ranging conversation on India’s evolving foreign policy, its relationship with Germany and the European Union, and its longstanding strategic partnership with Russia. Defending New Delhi’s ties with Moscow, he criticised what he described as European double standards.“You sound as if you can do business with states that are different, but we cannot... My neighbour Pakistan has caused every conceivable problem under the sun... But doesn't Germany also do business with Pakistan?” he asked.On Europe’s changing approach to global affairs, Jaishankar said the continent was beginning to move away from the assumption that its concerns automatically translate into global priorities. “I see big changes in Europe and Europe’s thinking... that it feels it should be more independent and more resilient,” he said.He welcomed Germany’s increasing role in global security, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, and expressed hope for stronger India-Germany defence cooperation. However, he acknowledged that “the conditions are not yet perfect” and India continues to press for deeper technological collaboration.Regarding the long-pending India-EU Free Trade Agreement, Jaishankar struck an optimistic tone. “Prime Minister Modi and EU Commission President von der Leyen have made it clear that the project should be completed by the end of the year... The agreement has strategic importance.”He also expressed confidence in Germany’s growing engagement with the Indo-Pacific and its understanding of India’s concerns over China. “When I look at Germany ten years ago, I see an enormous evolution... I see much stronger prospects for our partnership,” he said.","S Jaishankar rejects claims that the United States played a decisive role in brokering the recent ceasefire between India and Pakistan.

Pakistan was told of Operation Sindoor after May 7 strikes: EAM Jaishankar to parliament panel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-was-told-of-operation-sindoor-after-may-7-strikes-eam-jaishankar-to-parliament-panel/articleshow/121423489.cms,"EAM on info-share row: Never used word 'before'

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar Monday termed LoP Rahul Gandhi 's charge that Pakistan was told of Operation Sindoor in advance ""utter misrepresentation of facts and events"" that amounted to questioning the version of the armed forces.Briefing members of Parliament's consultative panel on external affairs, Jaishankar cited press briefings to say that armed forces had clearly stated that Pakistan was informed about Op Sindoor only after nine terror bases had been destroyed; a reference to the press briefing by DGMO Lt General Rajiv Ghai, who had said Pakistan was informed after India had struck the targets.Some reports said Jaishankar had informed Pakistan about the strikes 30 minutes after they commenced but this could not be confirmed.Sources said Jaishankar dismissed talk of US ""interference"", saying the decision to halt military operations was made bilaterally following a request from Pakistan, and on a ""you shoot, we shoot; you stop, we stop"" understanding.Jaishankar also said govt had responded to the US's suggestion that it engage with Pakistan by making it clear that ""terror and talks cannot coexist"".Rahul Gandhi has alleged that Jaishankar said he informed Pakistan ahead of the Indian strikes on terror targets and this made him an informant of Pakistan. ""I never used the word 'before' while talking about information sharing with Pakistan,"" a source quoted the minister as telling members of the parliamentary committee.Jaishankar never personally spoke with Pakistani officials and emphasised that India's DGMO notified Pakistan about the strikes on terror camps only after they were executed. The minister asserted the importance of unity at this juncture and said the govt needed the support of all. He also told members to reach out to him for any clarifications and not go by the media, sources said.Sources confirmed that the DGMO was the only line of communication with Pakistan during the conflict.Jaishankar said India had made it plain that it was prepared to counter any escalation, in what appeared to be a reference to PM Narendra Modi's response to US vice president J D Vance when the latter called on the night of May 9 to convey Pakistan's preparation for a massive retaliation.He told members that developments were in the works as far as the Indus Waters Treaty issue was concerned and the govt would share that with the committee when things materialised.He was asked to take measures to address the concerns of Punjab where young lives are being lost to narcotics terrorism. He heard the concerns and assured members that these would be discussed and addressed.He also addressed the geopolitical alignments that surfaced during the standoff. ""Only Turkiye and Azerbaijan stood openly with Pakistan,"" he told the committee.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri presented details of Operation Sindoor to the MPs, while Jaishankar addressed their queries.","S Jaishankar calls Rahul Gandhi's charge that Pakistan was told of Operation Sindoor in advance ""utter misrepresentation of facts and events"" He tells members of Parliament's consultative panel on external affairs: ""I never used the word 'before' while talking about information sharing with Pakistan""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121423568,imgsize-431889,width-400,resizemode-4/121423568.jpg"

'Delulu Land PM...': Pakistan Frames Its Fakery; Passes Off Chinese Drill Pic As India Strike

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army on Monday released a photo of the operations room from the night Operation Sindoor was under way against terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) on May 7.In the photo, top military brass, including Army chief Gen Upendra Dwivedi, Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi and Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal AP Singh, could be seen monitoring the operation.Under 'Operation Sindoor', the Indian Army targeted nine terror hideouts belonging to banned organisations Jaish-e-Mohammed Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen in Pakistan and PoJK.The strategic operation involved striking four locations within Pakistan's territory, while other five targets were situated in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. The military strikes were carried out two weeks after the deadly Pahalgam terror attack that claimed 26 lives.'Operation Sindoor' was executed through coordinated efforts of the Army, Navy and Air Force, conducted from Indian territory. The defence ministry described the operation as ""focused, measured and non-escalatory"", deliberately avoiding Pakistani military installations.On Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated that Operation Sindoor should not be treated as a one-off initiative and civil defence preparedness must be institutionalised by the states.During the Governing Council meeting of Niti Ayog, PM Modi said that the states must modernise their approach to civil preparedness. He also added that the recent mock drills have reignited our attention to civil defence states should institutionalize Civil Defence preparedness.Meanwhile, external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday chaired a meeting of the Consultative Committee of Parliament on External Affairs to discuss cross-border terrorism and the military strikes carried out under Operation Sindoor.The meeting addressed concerns raised by the opposition and shed light on diplomatic, military and international aspects of the operation.According to ANI sources, the panel was briefed that the government deliberately chose high-value terror targets early to deliver a strong message and expose the inability of Pakistani forces to protect the epicentres of terrorism. The strikes, officials said, had a major psychological impact on the Pakistani military. The EAM also highlighted India’s diplomatic strategy.Following Operation Sindoor, the Modi government deployed seven multi-party delegations across capitals to convey India’s zero-tolerance approach to terrorism. Most countries welcomed India’s action, with only Turkey, China, and Azerbaijan withholding support.","The Indian Army on Monday released a photo of the operations room from the night Operation Sindoor was under way against terrorist camps.

Else, the perpetrators will have to face consequences,"" Shah said.Condemning the Pahalgam terror attack as a cowardly act by Pakistan-sponsored terrorists, Shah recalled Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s firm stance in Patna following the incident.""Pakistan forgot that 11 years ago, there was a Congress government, which has now changed. We responded to the Uri, Pulwana and Pahalgham strikes and struck terror bases,"" he said.Highlighting the swiftness of India’s counter-offensive, Shah noted that nine terror camps were taken out in just 22 minutes during Operation Sindoor on May 7.

Nagpur woman's statements raised cops' suspicion about motive of Pak visit

NAGPUR/AMRITSAR: A 43-year-old Nagpur woman who had been detained in Pakistan for nine days after illegally crossing the LoC in Kargil district of Ladakh to meet a ""pastor"" she befriended online now stands accused of spying. A zero FIR has been filed against her in Punjab under the Official Secrets Act.SSP (Amritsar Rural) Maninder Singh said Monday Pakistan Rangers handed over the woman, a former nurse and mother of a 12-year-old boy, to BSF at the Attari border last weekend. Sunita Bholeshwar Jamgade had previously made two unsuccessful attempts to enter Pakistan through Attari. On both occasions, BSF intercepted her.Sunita, a resident of Kabir Nagar in Nagpur's Uppalwadi, is divorced. She had told her family that she knew a pastor in Pakistan with an adopted Muslim name. On May 14, she left her son in a lodge near Hundermaan, a frontier Kargil village, and asked him to wait there till she returned.After villagers informed the police about the stranded boy, he was put in the care of the Kargil Child Welfare Committee.Punjab Police said that although Pakistan Rangers decided not to detain Sunita further, her statements had raised suspicion of a motive that goes beyond meeting an online acquaintance in Pakistan.While Sunita maintained she travelled to Pakistan only to meet the person she was seemingly besotted with, the former nurse couldn't explain how she dodged security amid India-Pakistan hostilities to cross the LoC undetected.Initial findings suggest she traversed unfamiliar mountainous terrain to meet two Pakistani contacts - a man named Zulfikar and the unidentified ""pastor"". Sources in Nagpur Police said that security agencies found in her phone messages hinting at ties that may extend beyond a personal relationship.When she was first stopped at Attari while trying to enter Pakistan in March, the authorities let her off thinking she had a mental health problem. This time, officials suggested, they had enough reason to invoke the stringent Official Secrets Act against her.Nagpur zonal DCP Niketan Kadam said a team from Kapil Nagar police station would bring Sunita back to the city for a thorough probe into her background and possible motive.Kargil Child Welfare Committee chairperson Niyaz Ali said that the Ladakh administration had given it permission to escort Sunita's son back to Nagpur.","Sunita Bholeshwar Jamgade had previously made two unsuccessful attempts to enter Pakistan through Attari.

Basavaraju's death due to 'betrayal' by some in core formations: Naxals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/basavarajus-death-due-to-betrayal-by-some-in-core-formations-naxals/articleshow/121422461.cms,"Cops deny Reds' claim Basavaraju was caught alive

NEW DELHI: CPI (Maoist) blamed the death of its chief Basavaraju on betrayal by some within its 'core' Naxal formations active in the Maad area, including the PLGA Company No. 7 that was tasked with his proximate security cover.The statement holding ""compromised elements within"" accountable for the killing of Basavaraju in Narayanpur, issued via its Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC), came even as the Chhattisgarh Police conducted the last rites of the CPI(Maoist) general secretary and seven others on Monday in Narayanpur, citing the ""lack of any clear legal claimant"" to their bodies.CPI(Maoist) also admitted that 28, and not 27, ""comrades"" were killed in the operation, and pointed out mistakes in identification of two slain Maoists by police.TOI had exclusively reported on Monday that the Chhattisgarh Police was not keen to hand over Basavaraju's body to his kin or acquaintances for last rites in Srikakulam in Andhra Pradesh, fearing that a public funeral would glorify the mastermind behind the killing of hundreds of civilians and security personnel.The bodies of the remaining 19 Maoists killed in the May 21 operation by the District Reserve Guard wing of the Chhattisgarh Police were, however, handed over to their family members.The DKSZC statement, dated May 25, and signed by 'Vikalp', blamed the ""compromised"" and ""surrendered"" leaders and cadre of units active in Maad for feeding the Chhattisgarh Police and intelligence agencies with constant updates on Basavaraju's movements over the past six months. ""The cadre from different units in the Maad area turned traitors and would share our secret messages with police. Operations based on their leaks were conducted in Jan and March to get to Basavaraju. Six more surrenders over the past one and half months, including by a top cadre in Basavaraju's security detail, made the job of police easier,"" it said.The CPI(Maoist) press note, while corroborating how DRG personnel cornered Basavaraju by breaching and neutralising his protection team, said the Maoist general secretary was captured alive and then killed, a claim rubbished by Bastar IG P Sundarraj. ""The lie is a face-saver. The statement literally certifies our precise and perfectly-timed strike, how 28 of the 35 Maoists engaged ended up neutralised, and how it were the Maoists who killed a DRG personnel in the 'first round of fire' and another in an IED blast after the operation had ended,"" he told TOI.","CPI (Maoist) blamed the death of its chief Basavaraju on betrayal by some within its 'core' Naxal formations active in the Maad area.

PRAYAGRAJ: Draped in white coats and wielding scalpels, two brothers with only school-level education carved out roles as surgeons in UP's Kaushambi, performing operations inside a self-run hospital where no licensed doctor was in sight. Their bravado ended in tragedy when a six-year-old boy died after they removed a surgical rod from his leg - a procedure they had no legal or medical right to attempt.Vikas Kumar, 26, and Vishesh Kumar, 25, were arrested Sunday evening after investigation into the March death of the child. The boy's father Ram Asre of Siriyawa Kala village had filed an FIR on March 16, accusing the duo of causing his son's death through reckless treatment in a facility masquerading as a hospital.Anmol Hospital operated for nearly four years on Charwa-Manauri road.The facility's registration was in the name of the brothers' elder sibling Sanjay Kumar, a farmer with no medical background. Health authorities sealed it in July last year, but the facility resumed operations.The boy had earlier undergone legitimate surgery at a different hospital after suffering a leg fracture. But when time came to remove the implanted rod, his family returned to the local facility - unaware it was run by two men with class 12 education who never went to medical school. The brothers allegedly promised to arrange for a qualified surgeon but chose instead to perform the operation themselves. When the boy's condition deteriorated, one of the imposters rushed him to another hospital, but he died.The brothers confessed during police interrogation that money motivated their decision to conduct the surgery without expert help.","Vikas Kumar, 26, and Vishesh Kumar, 25, were arrested Sunday evening after investigation into the March death of the child.

The student has also challenged her rustication from college as being ""arbitrary and unlawful"". She is currently lodged in Yerwada central prison in Pune.The woman's advocate, Farhana Shah, on Monday appealed for urgent hearing citing her ongoing semester examinations, saying the student's liberty was snatched. Shah said the action for ""a social media post expressing personal opinions"" was taken without affording her any hearing. ""This was in gross violation of principles of natural justice and her fundamental rights to equality, freedom of expression, and life,"" the advocate said. Shah argued that it was only a repost with any intention, which she later deleted.On May 7, the student had reposted a social media post that was critical of Indian govt in the then-ongoing hostilities with Pakistan following Pahalgam terror attack.

Annabelle Doll Missing: ‘They lost Annabelle?’ Internet meltdown over haunted doll - here’s what really happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-lost-annabelle-internet-meltdown-over-haunted-doll-heres-what-really-happened/articleshow/121392274.cms,"Annabelle doll (Screengrab from FB video posted by Ryan D. Buell.)

The haunted doll that terrifies millions

From horror icon to internet meme





The infamous Annabelle doll, known as one of the most feared haunted objects in the world, became the center of an internet firestorm in the past few days after social media users claimed it had mysteriously vanished during a paranormal tour in the US. The doll, currently touring the country as part of the “Devils on the Run” exhibit, reportedly wasn’t visible to visitors at a recent stop, sparking fears, conspiracy theories, and viral panic online.The speculation intensified after a fire broke out at the historic Nottoway Resort in White Castle, Louisiana- just days after Annabelle had been displayed in the state. While officials confirmed that no injuries occurred and dismissed any supernatural link to the blaze, social media users quickly pointed to the doll’s presence as a chilling coincidence.“So the streets are saying after they moved the Annabelle doll out of the Warren museum (when they explicitly said never to move it) she's now gone missing.” one user posted on X (formerly Twitter), echoing the sentiments of thousands who feared the worst. Another exclaimed, “WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN THEY LOST THE ANNABELLE DOLL??? ONE OF THE MOST HAUNTED POSSESSIONS?? THAT ANNABELLE?""Despite the viral meltdown, the panic was short-lived.Dan Rivera of the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR), which oversees the Warren Occult Museum’s collection, released a video showing the doll safe and sound in its protective glass case back in Connecticut.“Some wild and crazy internet rumours this morning claiming that we lost Annabelle. She/it is NOT lost,” read the caption alongside the video, posted by Ryan D. Buell.The Annabelle doll’s legend dates back to the 1970s, when it was reportedly given as a gift to a nurse in Hartford, Connecticut. What appeared to be a harmless Raggedy Ann doll soon exhibited disturbing behavior- moving on its own, leaving handwritten notes, and allegedly attacking one of the occupants.The case caught the attention of famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, who concluded that the doll wasn’t possessed by a child’s spirit, but manipulated by a demonic entity. The Warrens took the doll into their care and placed it inside a sealed glass case in their Occult Museum, where it has remained under lock and key- until recently.Though the museum in Monroe, Connecticut, remains closed to the public, Annabelle is currently on a national tour, part of the “Devils on the Run” exhibit. The event showcases haunted artifacts from the Warrens' collection and has drawn massive interest across the country. In May, the doll made headlines after appearing at the former Moundsville State Penitentiary in West Virginia- a notoriously haunted site. A video of the doll being moved into the penitentiary racked up over 9 million views on TikTok, reigniting public fascination with the paranormal.Annabelle’s legend exploded into the mainstream with the 2014 release of Annabelle, the horror film that spun off from The Conjuring franchise. The series has since grossed more than $800 million globally, turning the doll into a pop culture icon—and a consistent source of real-world fear.Following its West Virginia appearance, Annabelle’s tour has included stops in New Orleans and is scheduled to continue in San Antonio, Texas, and other cities, including locations in Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky.In the meantime, whether the doll ever left the museum or whether the sightings were part of a promotional stunt remains unclear. What is certain, however, is that Annabelle continues to captivate and terrify the public imagination.(This is a top Google Trends topic)","The Annabelle doll is currently touring the country as part of the “Devils on the Run’ exhibit.

Who is Brigitte Macron? France's First Lady who allegedly slapped husband Emmanuel Macron,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/who-is-brigitte-macron-frances-first-lady-who-allegedly-slapped-husband-emmanuel-macron/articleshow/121413864.cms,"Early life and family background of Brigitte Macron

The Hanoi incident

Personal life





Brigitte Macron, the First Lady of France and wife of President Emmanuel Macron , is back in the spotlight after a viral video appeared to show her shoving or slapping the president aboard a plane in Vietnam. Emmanuel Macron later told reporters the moment was simply “bickering, or rather joking” with his wife and “nothing,” cautioning that such clips are often twisted by what he called “crackpots. ” He cited another instance where social media users falsely claimed a tissue he picked up during a train trip to Ukraine was cocaine. While the clip drew curiosity and controversy, Brigitte Macron is no stranger to headlines; her personal life, public image, and role in French politics have long sparked discussion and debate.Brigitte Macron was born Brigitte Marie-Claude Trogneux on 13 April 1953 in Amiens, France. She is the youngest of six children in a well-established family known for their chocolate business, Chocolaterie Trogneux, founded in 1872. The company is now run by her nephew, Jean-Alexandre Trogneux. Raised in a prominent and entrepreneurial household, Brigitte’s early life was grounded in traditional values and a close-knit community.Before entering the political spotlight, Brigitte Macron built a respected career in education. In the 1980s, she taught literature in Strasbourg and later worked at Lycée la Providence in Amiens, where she taught French and Latin. It was at this school that she met Emmanuel Macron, then a 15-year-old student and classmate of her daughter. From 2007 to 2015, she taught at the prestigious Lycée Saint-Louis de Gonzague in Paris, where she instructed the sons of luxury magnate Bernard Arnault.Brigitte’s relationship with Emmanuel Macron has long drawn public attention, largely due to their 25-year age difference and the circumstances of their meeting—he was a teenager and her student. Despite early criticism and media scrutiny, Macron has often described their bond as a powerful love that defied convention and was misunderstood by many. The couple married in 2007, following her divorce from banker André-Louis Auzière.Among the more bizarre and persistent conspiracy theories surrounding Brigitte Macron is the claim that she was born male and later transitioned. This theory originated in far-right and anti-government circles online and gained traction in 2021 when a woman named Natacha Rey published unsubstantiated claims alleging that Brigitte was born ""Jean-Michel Trogneux."" The rumour was widely circulated on social media and promoted by some outlets, particularly those opposing Emmanuel Macron.The Élysée Palace and Brigitte Macron’s legal team have categorically denied the claims, calling them defamatory and baseless. In December 2021, Brigitte Macron announced she would be taking legal action against those spreading the false narrative. Fact-checkers and reputable media outlets have debunked the story, emphasising that no credible evidence supports the accusation. The episode is now cited as a textbook case of digital misinformation aimed at undermining public figures through personal attacks.Though she holds no official title, Brigitte Macron plays a significant role in her husband’s presidency. She was an active participant in his 2017 campaign and has remained a visible presence in state affairs and international events. Macron initially proposed an official ""First Lady"" designation with a dedicated staff and budget, but public backlash led to a transparency charter instead, outlining her responsibilities without formal powers.Brigitte’s fashion sense and high-profile connections—such as her close relationship with Bernard Arnault's family—have frequently made headlines. She has been dressed by Louis Vuitton for official functions, a practice that has drawn criticism for perceived elitism. Commentators have both praised and mocked her style, with comparisons ranging from chic to controversial.A video showing what appeared to be Brigitte Macron slapping or shoving her husband on a plane in Hanoi surfaced online. The Élysée initially denied its authenticity but later described it as a ""moment of decompression"" between the couple. While Brigitte’s face was not visible, her arms were seen pushing the president’s face in a moment now dubbed by critics as ""awkward."" The First Lady also notably avoided taking the president’s offered arm upon disembarking. The episode has fuelled online rumours but was dismissed by insiders as harmless.Brigitte was previously married to banker André-Louis Auzière, with whom she had three children. After their divorce in 2006, she married Emmanuel Macron the following year. The couple currently resides at the Élysée Palace. She continues to be a central figure in Macron’s personal and political life.Despite facing waves of speculation and online attacks, Brigitte Macron remains a prominent figure in French public life—often navigating the intersection of political duty, personal identity, and public opinion under intense scrutiny.","Brigitte Macron was born Brigitte Marie-Claude Trogneux on 13 April 1953 in Amiens, France.

Gogoi vs Himanta

'Wait for knockout punch'

Congress vs BJP

Assam 2021 assembly election results

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Monday set the stage for a Gaurav Gogoi versus Himanta Biswa Sarma contest in the Assam assembly elections due next year. On Monday, Gogoi was elevated as president of the Assam Congress despite BJP's all-out offensive against the Congress leader over his British wife's alleged connection with the Pakistan spy agency ISI.Gogoi, the son of former Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi, has been engaged in a bitter, and often personal, war of words with Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma for the last several months.With this move, the Congress has sent out a clear message to the BJP that it will not go on the backfoot over Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma's unrelenting attacks against Gogoi.Hours before this Congress announcement today, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had fired a fresh salvo against Gogoi and claimed that a senior leader of the grand-old-party had made a ""startling confession"" that Gogoi's British wife was on the ""payroll of the Pakistan government"".The Assam CM was referring to the statement of Congress leader and former Rajya Sabha MP Ripun Bora that Gogoi's British wife Elizabeth Colburn works in an international NGO, which has a network in Pakistan, along with other countries.""She might have visited Pakistan or got a salary for her work, what's the problem with that? Likewise, many Pakistani people are working in India legally,"" Bora had said at a press conference.The Congress leader had also cited the examples of S Jaishankar and Ajit Doval to buttress his point.""Our external affairs minister S Jaishankar's wife is a Japanese citizen and their second child is a British citizen. Does it mean that we should doubt Jaishankar's patriotism?"" asked Bora.The Congress leader also took the example of National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval's younger son and brother, who have connections with Pakistan in their professional career.Himanta Sarma had last week alleged that Gaurav Gogoi had visited Pakistan on the invitation of ISI. ""Whether he had gone to Pakistan or not, what is his children's citizenship, whether his wife took salary from Pakistan or not, why he is waiting for the SIT, he can tell this to journalists. Himanta Biswa Sarma can tell a lie, but the Chief Minister of Assam cannot lie. If the Chief Minister of Assam lies, then a resolution should be taken out in the assembly, and the court can summon the Chief Minister. Wait till September 10,"" the Assam CM had said.Gogoi is yet to give a direct reply or any clarification to these allegations. However, the Congress leader has questioned the mental health of Himanta Sarma and also attributed the chief minister's offensive to ""problems at the family front"". When asked for his reactions, Gogoi said the people should be patient as a ""knockout punch is delivered at the end"" of a boxing match.In a series of posts on X, Gogoi had said Sarma's recent remarks were ""insane and nonsense"" and that he was behaving like an ""IT cell troll"" without talking with facts.""For some reason best known to him, I have been on his radar since my entry into Assam (politics). He has made many baseless remarks about me in the past 13 years. The most recent one borders on insanity and the absurd,"" the Congress Deputy Leader in Lok Sabha said.Gogoi also claimed that Sarma's ""inability"" to provide evidence to back ""Pakistan link"" charges against the opposition leader is his ""weakness"".Responding to a query about Sarma's recent remarks that every proof will be presented before the public by September 10, the Congress leader questioned, “Is this a movie where the release date is pre-fixed? Are we watching Singham 1 or Singham 2?”The rivalry between the two leaders started when Himanta Sarma was in the Congress and was the favourite to take over the party’s reins from Congress veteran Tarun Gogoi, who was then the chief minister of Assam. However, then Gaurav Gogoi entered active politics under his father and started to get prominence in the party. This led to the exit of Sarma, who went on to join the BJP.The BJP stormed to power in Assam in 2016, winning 60 of the 126 assembly seats. While the BJP gained 55 seats compared to 2011, the Congress lost 52 seats. In 2021, the BJP maintained its score of 60 while the Congress made a marginal improvement of 3 seats and increased its tally to 29.As the two parties gear up for the 2026 battle, the stakes are high for both the parties. The Congress, which has lost two consecutive assembly elections in the state, will be desperate for a win this time around. Gaurav Gogoi will hope to ride on anti-incumbency against the BJP and help the Congress make a comeback in the state after a gap of 10 years.Himanta, who had quit the Congress in 2015, played a key role in helping the BJP conquer the northeast region. However, it was only in 2021 that he was made the chief minister by the BJP. The 2026 elections will be a test of his popularity as it will be fought on his five years of rule. He will be keen to lead the party to a third consecutive victory in the state.",The Congress on Monday set the stage for a Gaurav Gogoi versus Himanta Biswa Sarma contest in the Assam assembly elections due next year. The Congress has sent out a clear message to the BJP that it will not go on the backfoot over Assam chief minister Himanta Sarma's unrelenting attacks.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121419546,imgsize-51728,width-400,resizemode-4/121419546.jpg"

CHENNAI: MNM leader and actor Kamal Haasan is all set to enter Rajya Sabha following a poll deal with DMK . PMK MP Anbumani Ramadoss may find it an uphill task to retain his seat considering he has no backing from either of the big Dravidian parties. The upcoming Rajya Sabha elections are generating significant political buzz in Tamil Nadu, with DMK and AIADMK expected to secure four and two seats respectively. Election to Rajya Sabha will be held on June 19 and counting of the votes will take place at 5pm the same day.The election was necessitated after vacancies caused by the terms of M Shanmugam, M Mohamed Abdulla and P Wilson (all from DMK), Vaiko (MDMK) and Anbumani coming to an end. Kamal Haasan is poised to become an RS member, thanks to a poll agreement with the DMK leadership during the 2024 LS elections. His party MNM is preparing to formalise his candidature. “The central governing body and executive committee of MNM led by Kamal Haasan will meet on Wednesday or Thursday to endorse his candidature,” said an MNM leader. “A committee set up by the leadership will engage in talks with the DMK allies for the next course of action,” said an MNM leader.Securing an RS seat requires 34 votes in the 234-member legislature. The DMK alliance commands a strong position with 159 seats. AIADMK, led by Edappadi K Palaniswami, with 62 MLAs, is expected to comfortably win two seats, bolstered by its renewed alliance with BJP, which has four MLAs.O Panneerselvam faction’s four MLAs, who technically remain AIADMK members in the state assembly, are expected to back the party. Sources indicate that MLAs are required to show their ballot paper after marking votes to the authorised agent of that party for verification as per Conduct of Election Rules. “The AIADMK leadership is all set to nominate a candidate belonging to dalit and a minority community,” said a senior leader.Anbumani’s prospects appear dim due to the absence of an alliance with either DMK or AIADMK. Despite this, some PMK functionaries remain hopeful that the party leadership can devise an electoral strategy to gain the support of AIADMK. “I have nothing to say,” said PMK spokesman K Balu. AIADMK has received several requests from party aspirants, including several former ministers.As for BJP, it is not clear yet if it would seek a seat from AIADMK. In reply to questions by reporters, BJP state president Nainar Nagenthran said, “It will be decided by the national leadership.” Within MDMK, some members have requested DMK leadership to retain Vaiko’s seat. DMK may not yield to pressure this time.Speculation within the DMK camp suggests that sitting MPs P Wilson and M Mohammed Abdulla may be re-elected. Wilson was recently recognised for his successful handling of the case involving the governor’s assent to bills passed by the legislature. Other potential candidates include former MPs T K S Elangovan and R S Bharathi, as well as party headquarters secretary for media relations J Constatine Ravindran.","Kamal Haasan is poised to become an RS member, thanks to a poll agreement with the DMK leadership during the 2024 LS elections.

Samoa's leader seeks an early election after opponents reject her budget,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/samoas-leader-seeks-an-early-election-after-opponents-reject-her-budget/articleshow/121426496.cms,"Samoan Prime Minister Afioga Fiamē Naomi Mataʻafa (left) (Image credit: AP)



Warnings about election readiness:





Samoa 's Prime Minister said she would seek to dissolve Parliament, prompting an early election, after a vote on her government's budget for the next year failed Tuesday.Fiamē Naomi Mata'afa's admission of defeat followed months of political havoc in the South Pacific island nation, during which the leader survived two votes of no confidence and struggled on with a minority government. Her budget was rejected during a swift vote in the capital Apia, with 34 lawmakers against it, 16 in favor and two abstaining.An election must be held within 90 days. Samoa, a country of about 200,000 people, was due to go to the polls next April.Samoa's first woman leader Fiamē has led Samoa since 2021, when she ousted her predecessor of 22 years. She is the country's first woman prime minister and in 1991 was the first woman appointed to Samoa's Cabinet.The daughter of a former prime minister, Fiamē is one of the region's longest-serving politicians. She came to power after splitting with the previous leader's party over constitutional changes that she said would undermine the rule of law.Fiamē holds a chiefly rank as a village leader, rare for women in Samoa. She remains an outlier, too, in Pacific island politics, where only 8 per cent of parliamentarians are women, according to January figures from the Inter-Parliamentary Union.Politics roiled for months Tuesday's budget defeat capped months of political turmoil after Fiamē in January sacked a Cabinet member who faced a raft of criminal charges and is also her party's chairman. He in turn expelled Fiamē from the FAST party and forced her into a minority government.She beat two no-confidence motions since. Debate over the efforts to unseat her provoked outrage among some in Samoa when Fiamē's opponents derided her for being unmarried and suggested she needed a husband's advice.Earlier this month Fiamē told reporters she would contest the election next April. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.In Parliament Tuesday morning, the leader warned lawmakers that rejecting the budget would provoke operational problems for the government, according to Pacific news outlet PMN. Fiamē also cautioned that a re-registration process for Samoa's voters, which was expected to conclude before next April's vote, had only captured 52 per cent of Samoans in the new system so far.The old registration system was obsolete, her government said last year.Fiamē has drawn attention outside Samoa for urging larger powers, such as Australia, to do more to curb the effects of climate change, which have been ruinous for low-lying Pacific island nations. She also took a more cautious approach than her predecessor to Beijing's bankrolling of infrastructure projects in Samoa, which is heavily in debt to China.Samoa has this year faced severe electricity shortages that Fiamē warned in April could seriously hamper the country's economy.","Fiamē Naomi Mata'afa's admission of defeat follows months of political havoc in the South Pacific island nation.

Brush fire burning near Fort Stanton, New Mexico





A fast-moving wildfire swept through the historic Fort Stanton site in southern New Mexico on Monday, burning more than half a square mile (1.4 square kms) of land and prompting evacuations of nearby campgrounds and a horse ranch.The blaze damaged three structures at the Fort Stanton historic site, a civil war-era landmark, and spread across surrounding federal conservation lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), reported AP.The cause of the fire is still unknown, and a BLM investigator is expected to begin assessing the origin on Tuesday.Ground crews, helicopters, and air tankers worked together to contain the fire, which remained uncontained as of Monday. Firefighters focused on clearing vegetation lines to the north and dropping water on smoldering hotspots from the air, said Laura Rabon, spokesperson for the multi-agency response team.While fire activity had eased somewhat due to mild weather, with temperatures around 75 degrees (24 Celsius) and 10 mph (16 kph) winds, the threat remained.On Sunday, air tankers dropped fire retardant around the edges of the fire to help slow it down.A nearby horse ranch was also evacuated, and a family of four along with their horses were moved to safety. They have now returned home.Highway 220 near Fort Stanton was closed to ensure fire crews had access, and three nearby campgrounds were evacuated and remain closed.The fire has sparked concern in a region still recovering from devastating wildfires last year that destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses in nearby Ruidoso, located about 15 miles (24 kilometers) away. Those fires were followed by severe flooding and erosion.","A fast-moving wildfire swept through the historic Fort Stanton site in southern New Mexico on Monday.

WASHINGTON: US President Trump said on Monday he is considering taking $3 billion of previously awarded grant money away from Harvard University and giving it to trade schools across the US.His comments, which were made on Truth Social, come less than a week after his administration sought to block the Ivy League school from enrolling foreign students. Trump has frozen some $3 billion in grants to Harvard in recent weeks, leading the university to sue to restore the funding.Most of that grant money is appropriated by Congress for the National Institutes of Health to disburse to fund biomedical research, however, which is not typically done at trade schools. Harvard did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House did not immediately comment on what specific funds Trump wants to repurpose.On Friday, a US judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students, a policy the Ivy League school said was part of Trump's broader effort to retaliate against it for refusing to ""surrender its academic independence"".The order provides temporary relief to thousands of international students, who were faced with potentially having to transfer under a policy the university called a ""blatant violation"" of the US Constitution and other federal laws. It said the move would have an ""immediate and devastating effect"" on the university and more than 7,000 visa holders. Harvard enrolled nearly 6,800 international students in its current school year, representing 27% of total enrollment.The move was the latest escalation in a broader battle between Harvard and White House, as Trump seeks to compel varsities, law firms, media, courts and other institutions to align with his agenda.(This is a Reuters story)",Trump has frozen some $3 billion in grants to Harvard in recent weeks.

The property was sold in 2022 and is now owned by the Waldorf Astoria chain. So Executive Branch will be his break zone when he can't travel to Mar-a-Lago.The club is not for any Saudi businessman, as they can visit any of the other clubs in the capital.

Making a political comeback, Donald Trump won the 2024 US presidential election, defeating Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. Trump secured 312 electoral votes, while Harris finished with 226, making Trump the first US president since Grover Cleveland to return to office after a gap.Trump’s win was powered by key victories in battleground states such as Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. His campaign focused heavily on economic issues, immigration, and crime, themes that resonated with large sections of the electorate, particularly in suburban and rural areas.He also made notable gains among Latino and Black voters compared to previous Republican performances.Kamala Harris, who had served as vice president under Joe Biden, ran on a platform of protecting democracy, healthcare access, and abortion rights, but struggled to overcome economic concerns and voter fatigue with the Democratic administration.The Republican Party also regained control of the Senate and held onto the House of Representatives, giving them a full legislative majority.This GOP trifecta marks a significant shift in US politics and is expected to shape future policy directions on immigration, taxes, and foreign affairs.Voter turnout was strong, crossing 63 per cent, reflecting the deep national interest in the high-stakes election.","Trump secured 312 electoral votes, while Harris finished with 226, making Trump the first US president since Grover Cleveland to return to office after a gap.

With the benefit of hindsight—and hindsight is always immensely beneficial—one can say that when Derek Chauvin decided to press his knee into George Floyd’s neck, he not only committed an act of brutality that shocked the world but inadvertently triggered a political chain reaction that broke the Democratic Party as we know it and made America apathetic to dissent, thanks to the faltering Black Lives Matter movement.For those who need a trip down memory lane, on May 25, 2020, a white police officer in Minneapolis knelt on the neck of a Black man for over nine agonising minutes because a store clerk alleged he had used a counterfeit $20 bill at a convenience store. The horrifying footage, showing Floyd pleading for his life, calling for his mother, and then going still, became an enduring political image of our time, igniting both America and the world.Millions took to the streets as it became the largest civil rights protest in American history.From Andheri to Amsterdam, activists across the world, who wouldn’t be able to name a single victim of police brutality in their own cities—even with a gun to their head—made placards for George Floyd. Black Lives Matter became a rallying call of global justice against racial injustice, police brutality, and every form of tyranny.America, which till 2008 held the record for the highest percentage of individuals incarcerated (it’s now number five behind El Salvador, Cuba, Rwanda, and Turkmenistan), looked like it would have to reckon with its history of police brutality and intolerance—and the movement that was at the heart of this reckoning was Black Lives Matter.The movement had been around since 2013, but in 2020, it became the litmus test of political morality. Corporates wrote “Black Lives Matter” on their social media profiles. Sports teams and celebrities said it with pride. Even Mitt Romney joined a march, and it appeared that Black Lives Matter was an absolute vote-winner, a chance for Democrats to finally be on the right side of history and wash their racist past of supporting slavery.Statues of Lincoln, Roosevelt, and even Frederick Douglass were defaced or toppled in a frenzy that felt more therapeutic than political.Meanwhile, murals of George Floyd sprang up across the world—not as a symbol of state brutality, but elevated as a near-messianic icon. Yet Floyd was not Malcolm X, nor was he Martin Luther King Jr. He was not a philosopher of resistance or a tactician of civil disobedience. He was just a man caught in the wrong moment, a victim of America’s original sin whose tragic death was contorted into sainthood by a movement too thirsty for symbols and too shallow for substance.BLM became the moral edifice of the post-Obama era, as Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer kneeled in kente cloths to show they were listening and learning.“Defund the police” went from fringe activist language to main theme song. Voices of concern that suggested putting all eggs in this basket could portend troubling times were silenced, among them House Majority Whip James Clyburn, who forewarned that BLM could do as much damage as “Burn, baby, burn” during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.The Dems were also not helped by the internal scandals of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, which raised $90 million in 2020, of which only one-third reached local chapters or other charitable causes. Most was instead used for self-enrichment and self-adducent through consulting fees, salaries, and questionable real estate purchases.Co-founder Patrisse Cullors faced public scrutiny after purchasing four properties worth over $3 million. One, a $6 million mansion in Los Angeles, was described as a ""creative campus"" but appeared more suited to influencer content creation than grassroots organising. $1.6 million was paid to her brother for security services, and $2.1 million went to a board member’s consulting firm. And in 2024, when BLMGNF sued the Tides Foundation for mismanagement of $33 million in donations, it further clouded the narrative.Families of victims whose names powered the movement were among the harshest critics. Breonna Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer, accused BLM of profiting from her daughter’s death. Samaria Rice, mother of Tamir Rice, called the group ""a fraud.""As the Democrats coped with the fallout of the Black Lives Matter movement, the Republicans—always making up in message discipline what they lack in moral urgency—branded themselves the party of rule of law, order, security, and anti-wokeness, while placing their bets on an ex-con and reality TV star best known for wheeling and dealing.Cities with BLM protests like San Francisco, Portland, and Chicago were painted as lawless dystopias where rioters could walk out with any shopping item they needed. Despite the fact that most police budgets grew or remained intact, and that violent crime rates were actually down, perception became reality.In 2022, Republicans had spent over $50 million on crime-related ads, with over half targeting BLM or ""defund the police"" talking points. It was at the heart of Marco Rubio’s re-election to the Senate, as he managed to make his Democratic opponent Val Demings—a former police chief who explicitly called “defunding” crazy—still fend off the attack. The GOP’s framing was ruthlessly effective: Democrats were lifeless, cowardly, and captive to radicals.BLM also became a dog whistle—then a bullhorn—for the Republican cultural offensive that painted Democrats as out-of-touch priests and priestesses of elite academia.For anxious middle Americans, BLM was the main course of liberal overreach, with sides of trans-obsession in schools and sports, Critical Race Theory in classrooms, drag shows, gender pronouns, cancel culture, and ESG mandates.Interestingly, Trump’s popularity dipped in the aftermath of the George Floyd protests, helping swing voters towards the Dems. The aftereffect handed the GOP the initiative.By 2023–24, with Trump staging his comeback, Republicans had tied BLM to everything from crime and inflation to classroom politics. Trump’s “law and order” brand benefited from the perception—if not the reality—of rising urban crime. While FBI data showed violent crime declined in 2022 and 2023 after a 2020 spike, the public felt otherwise: Gallup found 63% of Americans in 2023 believed crime was a “very” or “extremely serious” problem. Perception had overtaken data, and the GOP was quick to exploit it.What the numbers say is this: while BLM initially sparked a wave of sympathy and demands for change, the long arc of public opinion—and electoral data—suggests a backlash that cut deep into Democratic coalitions. Trump’s approval dipped during the height of protests, but by 2024, his support among young Black men and Latino men under 45 had significantly risen, doubling in some cases from 2020 levels. Asian-American support for Democrats slipped by 7 percentage points. Meanwhile, Gallup showed crime concerns hitting a two-decade high, with 77% of Americans believing crime had worsened.FBI data showed crime falling, but perception had become political reality. Democrats, divided over identity politics and slogans like “defund the police,” found themselves losing support from working-class, suburban, and minority voters who had once formed their backbone. In the final tally, these shifts didn’t just help Trump win—they redrew the battleground map, helping Trump become the first Republican since George Bush in 2004 to win the popular vote.BLM's impact on Harris’s 2024 campaign was especially acute. Harris, once seen as a future-facing icon of multiracial America, was dragged down by her past support for bail funds during the protests and her association with reformist messaging. Her lifeless interviews and townhalls, often with vacillating accents punctuated with a laughter track, didn’t really assuage voters.When the DNC moved to coronate her as nominee following Biden’s exit, BLM activists publicly objected, demanding a “virtual snap primary,” accusing the party elites of ignoring grassroots voices. Harris failed to explain whether she was pro- or anti-BLM or how her campaign would be any different from Biden’s, and Trump, on the other hand, used every opportunity to use BLM’s legacy to call out Dems for the disorder and chaos.The cultural reckoning that began with Floyd’s murder had, five years later, helped bring Donald Trump back to the White House—where he and his merry band of Peter Principle apostles returned. The first African-American Supreme Court Justice, Thurgood Marshall, had argued that democracy couldn’t flourish amid fear, not when one played ostrich. Liberty could never bloom amid hate, and justice could never take root amid rage.He had said in 1992: “We must dissent from the apathy. We must dissent from the fear, the hatred and the mistrust. We must dissent from a nation that has buried its head in the sand, waiting in vain for the needs of its poor, its elderly, and its sick to disappear and just blow away. We must dissent from a government that has left its young without jobs, education or hope. We must dissent from the poverty of vision and the absence of moral leadership. We must dissent because America can do better, because America has no choice but to do better.”Sadly, Black Lives Matter didn’t just become an albatross around the Democratic Party’s neck. It also ended up making Americans so cynical that instead of dissenting from apathy, they ended up becoming apathetic to dissent.","In May 2020, a police officer in Minneapolis knelt on the neck of a Black man for over nine agonising minutes because a store clerk alleged he had used a counterfeit $20 bill at a convenience store.

Poll Do you believe that climate change is contributing to extreme weather events in Pakistan? Yes No





At least 14 people were killed and more than 100 injured after powerful windstorms swept across central and northern Pakistan following a days-long heatwave, officials confirmed on Sunday.The storms, described as “particularly destructive” by authorities, battered the provinces of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa as well as Islamabad on Saturday afternoon and evening.Mazhar Hussain, spokesperson for the Punjab disaster management authority, was quoted by news agency AFP as saying, “This windstorm was particularly destructive. The wind speed was very high. There was so much dust in it that visibility was greatly reduced.”According to him, the extreme weather followed several days of intense heat, with temperatures exceeding 45°C. “There were three to four days in the recent heatwave where temperatures went up quite a lot,” he added, attributing the sudden storm to the intense build-up of heat.The majority of casualties were caused by collapsing roofs and walls, while at least two people died after being struck by solar panels dislodged by high-speed winds.In one tragic incident, lightning claimed the life of one man and injured three others.The storms uprooted trees, knocked over electric poles, and caused significant damage to vehicles and infrastructure. Social media was flooded with dramatic videos showing the aftermath, including a viral clip filmed inside a passenger plane struggling to land in Lahore before being diverted to Karachi amid severe turbulence.Islamabad and surrounding areas have also seen multiple unusual hailstorms over April and May, damaging vehicles and solar panels—marking a growing trend of erratic and extreme weather events in the country.Pakistan is widely recognised as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, with early summers and intense heatwaves becoming increasingly common.India is also battling extreme temperatures. According to news agency ANI, Rajasthan's Jaisalmer hit 48°C, forcing locals indoors. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) warned that severe heatwave conditions will continue in Rajasthan until May 27 and in Punjab, Haryana, and Jammu and Kashmir until May 26.Meanwhile, heavy monsoon rainfall has already arrived on India’s west coast, with IMD forecasting intense downpours over Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Goa in the coming week.Back in Pakistan, the Meteorological Department has predicted more storms on Sunday, raising concerns about further damage and casualties.","Powerful windstorms swept across central and northern Pakistan following a days- long heatwave.

Poll Do you believe that the assassination of journalists in Balochistan is a systematic issue? Yes, it is a systematic issue. No, it's an isolated incident.





Abdul Latif Baloch, a well-known journalist in Pakistan's Balochistan province, was shot dead inside his home in Mashkay, in the wee hours of Saturday.The Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), a local rights group, confirmed that he was shot by state-backed armed groups at around 3 am, in front of his wife and children, reported news agency ANI.Latif was respected for his fearless coverage of human rights abuses and military operations in Balochistan. His work focused on enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and the struggle of ordinary Baloch citizens. His death underlines the extreme risk faced by reporters in Pakistan.This incident comes just months after his son, Saif Baloch, and seven other family members were reportedly abducted by security forces and later found dead. Activists describe these patterns of violence as part of Pakistan’s “kill and dump” policy, used to silence dissent and suppress the Baloch identity.Shalee Baloch of the Baloch Women Forum described the killing as part of “systemic violence” against the Baloch people. She urged international organisations and media to intervene, saying silence from the global community is enabling further bloodshed.Human rights groups and press freedom organisations have condemned the assassination and are calling for urgent international pressure on Pakistan with regard to Balochistan. The region has been the site of persistent and grave human rights violations, including enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and the suppression of dissenting voices.","Abdul Latif Baloch, a well-known journalist in Pakistan's Balochistan province, was shot dead inside his home in Mashkay.
