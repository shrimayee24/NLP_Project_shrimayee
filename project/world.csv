Sahar had described her victory as a demonstration of the party's growing influence at the grassroots.Sahar's aggressive victory speech was aimed at NCP (SP) MLA Jitendra Awhad. She had entered the electoral fray after the NCP(SP) declined to field her as its candidate. She said the election results had shattered the ego of political opponents who, according to her, believed they could dominate the people of Mumbra.However, her remarks stoked controversy as rivals accused her of giving communal colour to AIMIM's victory in the civic body polls. The Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM registered significant gains in the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) elections, bagging five of the 131 seats and outperforming parties like Congress, which failed to open its account, and Shiv Sena (UBT) which secured just 1 seat.Reacting to Sahar's remarks, Shiv Sena leader Shaina NC said she should clarify whether she was talking about a green and clean environment or about dividing people on the basis of religion.With her remarks leading to a controversy, Sahar Shaikh clarified today and said: ""We are promoting green colour, because the colour of my flag is green. Had the colour of my flag been orange or saffron, I would have promoted it ... This was party-level politics, but the opposition turned it into communal politics.

5 traffic offences in a year could bar you from driving,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-traffic-offences-in-a-year-could-bar-you-from-driving/articleshow/127055072.cms,"Traffic offences will not be carried over beyond one year

NEW DELHI: Five or more traffic offences in a year and you could be barred from driving for 3 months. This provision - disqualification or revocation of driving licence (DL) - has been added by the road transport ministry through a fresh amendment to the Motor Vehicles Rules to rein in habitual errant drivers, reports .The licensing authority - RTO or district transport office - has the power to decide on suspension of DL. The rules also state that licensing authority must give the licence holder an opportunity of being heard. The notification published Wednesday said the condition of five or more offences in a year for disqualification of DL commences from Jan 1.The new notification said that ""no offence or contravention recorded in any previous one-year period shall be taken into account for determining offences or contravention in any subsequent one-year period"".Till now, there were 24 provisions in the rules that could trigger the licencing authority concerned to initiate disqualification of DL. These included theft of vehicle, assault on passenger(s), abduction of passenger(s), driving beyond permitted speed limit, overloading and abandoning vehicle in a public space.These provisions have been made considering that these ""constitute nuisance or danger to public"".Now, going by the new provision of five or more traffic offences, such as not wearing helmet, seat belt and jumping red signal, can result in suspension of DLs.The new provision drew mixed reaction from experts in road traffic laws.Former Delhi deputy transport commissioner Anil Chhikara said that while disqualification after five offences is a step in the right direction, but ""the conflict is that people driving dangerously are not caught by traffic police"". He added that in absence of a standard operating procedure (SOP), traffic offences recorded using CCTV cameras are often challenged in courts.Rohit Baluja, who teaches police, transport and judicial officers on laws related to motor vehicles, termed the amendment ""draconian and conceptually flawed"".The ministry's notification also specified the procedures for issuing, managing and paying traffic challans, or fines. It said that any police officer in uniform or any other officer authorised by state govt will issue a challan and there can be auto-generation of e-challans. The violator can pay the challan or contest it within 45 days.

Donald Trump Cites India Pakistan Ceasefire While Defending Nobel Gesture But Facts Raise Questions

Also read |

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Wednesday stepped up its attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi after US President Donald Trump once again claimed that he was responsible for ending the India-Pakistan conflict last year. The opposition party said the count of such assertions has now risen to 70.The swipe came after Trump highlighted ending the India-Pakistan conflict as one of the major accomplishments of the first year of his second term in the White House. He claimed the two countries “were going to go nuclear” and said millions of lives were saved because of his intervention. The US president said he ended “eight unendable wars in 10 months”.Reacting to Trump’s remarks, Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X, “Before yesterday the count stood at 68. Yesterday itself the count shot up not to 69 but to 70 - once in the opening statement of his White House Press Conference and later in the Q&A.”“That is the number of times the PM's ‘good friend’ and the recipient of his many forced hugs has declared that he was responsible for the sudden and unexpected halt of Operation Sindoor on May 10, 2025,” Ramesh said.At a press conference in Washington, Trump said, “These were unendable wars - Cambodia and Thailand fighting for years, Kosovo and Serbia, the Congo and Rwanda. Pakistan and India, they were really going at it. Eight planes shot down. They were going to go nuclear in my opinion.”Addressing a packed White House press briefing room, Trump said “the prime minister of Pakistan, who visited him in Washington last year, said that ‘President Trump saved 10 million people, and maybe much more than that’. They’re both nuclear countries.”Later in the 105-minute press conference, Trump again claimed credit for ending the war between India and Pakistan.Responding to a question on how winning the Nobel Peace Prize would have improved the lives of everyday Americans, Trump said he had saved probably tens of millions of lives by ending eight wars across the world.“If you add up the numbers, just if you look at any one of those wars, you're talking about millions of people. You multiply it eight times. But when you look at India and Pakistan, that could have been 10,15,20 million people. It could have been more than that. So I saved millions of people. So that to me is the big thing,” Trump said.Trump has repeatedly claimed that he stopped the conflict between India and Pakistan, making the assertion on various platforms in the US and around the world since May 10 last year, when he announced on social media that the two countries had agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire after talks mediated by Washington.India has consistently denied any third-party intervention.Trump also said that he should have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for ending wars, including conflicts between Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Armenia and Azerbaijan.",The Congress stepped up its attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Omar invokes Jinnah’s two-nation theory to taunt calls for separate Jammu state,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/omar-invokes-jinnahs-two-nation-theory-to-taunt-calls-for-separate-jammu-state/articleshow/127038477.cms,"SRINAGAR: Breaking his silence on demands for separation of Jammu and Kashmir, chief minister Omar Abdullah on Wednesday accused BJP MLAs of echoing Pakistan founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s two-nation theory.“Why are BJP legislators demanding a separate Jammu state? They do not have the interests of the people of Jammu in mind,” Omar said while addressing National Conference workers in Jammu.The CM mounted a sharp attack on leader of opposition Sunil Sharma, accusing him of pursuing his personal ambition to become chief minister. “…For that, he is using some people in Jammu and a few yes-men in Kashmir. They are promoting Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s two-nation theory that Hindus and Muslims cannot live together,” Omar said, adding: “Be straightforward. Why don’t you say ‘separate Hindu Jammu’?”Taking further potshots at the BJP leader, he said Sharma’s demand would limit him to being the CM of “two-and-half districts”, suggesting that the Muslim majority areas of Jammu — the Pir Panjal region comprising Rajouri and Poonch districts, and the Chenab Valley comprising Doda, Kishtwar and Ramban districts — would not support Jammu’s separation from Kashmir. “If you want to divide Jammu and Kashmir on the basis of religion, you will end up being chief minister of Kanak Mandi and Raghunath Bazaar,” Omar taunted, referring to two markets in Jammu city.He also targeted Mehbooba Mufti-led PDP, calling it an “old ally” of BJP. “They have now started talking about separate divisions for Rajouri-Poonch and the Chenab Valley. But remember, as long as the National Conference’s flag is flying in J&K, this conspiracy will not succeed,” the CM said.Mehbooba had on Monday demanded carving out separate divisions from Jammu to make governance accessible in hilly regions.Reacting to Omar’s jibes, Sharma said neither he nor BJP had made any official statement on further bifurcation of J&K. He also rejected claims that he desired to become CM, saying he came from a poor family and his only aim was to work for humanity and the nation. “In contrast, it is people in the Abdullah family who desire to be chief minister as they want to have protocol in place even when skiing, so that no one else should be around when he plays,” he retorted.A debate over the issue started earlier this month after BJP legislator Sham Lal Sharma pitched for a separate Jammu state, alleging discrimination against the region by “Kashmir-based rulers”. Several BJP legislators, including Vikram Randhawa, have since accused the CM of imposing “Kashmiri sentiment” on Jammu. Randhawa said Ladakhis sought separate UT because of Kashmiri dominance, and the same reason had spurred the calls for a separate Jammu state.","Omar Abdullah accuses BJP MLAs of echoing Pakistan founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s two-nation theory. “Why are BJP legislators demanding a separate Jammu state?

Are those from Delhi or Gujarat not our brothers? Thousands come here, and they are welcome. In the same spirit, the people of Jammu will remain our brothers tomorrow as well. God willing, even after separation, brotherhood will remain,” he said.On Farooq’s statement that a division would be against secular ethos, Lone said: “India has a population of 1.5 billion. We are barely six or seven million. Aren’t we speaking far beyond our weight? Did we ever sign a contract to safeguard secularism?” Kashmiri leaders routinely claimed the moral high ground of secularism, while students from the Valley continued to be beaten, humiliated and targeted across the country, he alleged.Kashmiris had never consented to bear this disproportionate burden of unity, he asserted. Lone said while Kashmiri Muslims remained on the frontline in the fight against terrorism, with nearly 90% of police martyrs being from the community, a “relentless campaign of hatred”, he alleged, was emanating from Jammu.As a debate rages on over the issue, with Jammu repeatedly alleging discrimination by Kashmir-centric govt, the People’s Conference chief had recently reacted strongly after BJP and a section of the high court bar association raised a demand that the National Law University proposed in Budgam be shifted to Jammu. “Maybe, the time has come for an amicable divorce.

Ladakh was represented by the LAB and the KDA, which are amalgam of political and religious groups from the Leh and Kargil regions, respectively.The first round of the talks took place after the Centre’s ordered an inquiry into the Sept 24 police firing on protesters in Leh who were demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status for the region. Four protesters were killed in the firing. After the commission of inquiry was set up, the LAB and the KDA agreed to begin talks with the Centre, leading to the Oct 22 meeting.Later, on Nov 14, the LAB and the KDA submitted a 29-page joint draft proposal to the home ministry seeking statehood and Sixth Schedule. The proposal also sought a general amnesty for LAB member and climate activist Sonam Wangchuk and others detained after the Sept 24 protests.","A delegation from Zanskar region of Kargil on Wednesday evening met Union minister of state for home Nityanand Rai.

It is imperative that we continue to work with renewed vigour to strengthen Manipur’s development trajectory. I assure you of the Centre’s full and steadfast support in this endeavour.”“Since 2014, our govt has worked with the resolve of ‘Act East, Act Fast’ to empower the region, unlock opportunities for progress and fulfil the aspirations of the people,” he said.Writing to Tripura CM Manik Saha, Modi said it was an undeniable reality that the people of the Northeast, including Tripura, had for decades felt distant and isolated from national mainstream.The PM said that govt’s vision of ‘Purvodaya’ is transforming the Northeast.While Tripura once faced insurgency and unrest, the 2024 peace accord with NLFT and ATTF has ushered in a new dawn of hope, he said.The Prime Minister told Meghalaya CM Conrad Sangma that development in the Northeast had stagnated before NDA govt got a historic mandate in 2014 and began working extensively to transform the region.","PM Narendra Modi wrote separate letters to heads of govt of Manipur, Tripura and Meghalaya.

It has video grabs of the CM and her aides allegedly taking away documents and digital devices from the premises of I-PAC on Jan 8 when it was being searched by the central probe agency in connection with a coal smuggling case, which can be used in a separate case of destruction of evidence.I-PAC is under investigation for suspected laundering of unaccounted cash regarding which a few hawala dealers have also been questioned and their statements recorded by the agency.Banerjee has been made respondent No 2 in ED’s criminal writ petition before Supreme Court demanding action against those indulging in obstruction of its Jan 8 search operation. SC has already issued notices to the CM and her officers, including the state DGP Rajeev Kumar, respondent No 3, commissioner of Kolkata Police Manoj Verma, respondent No 4, Priyabrata Roy, DCP South Kolkata and CBI. The ED’s plea has also made Union home secretary and DoPT secretary besides Bengal’s chief secretary other respondents in the case, which has been scheduled for next hearing in the apex court in the first week of Feb.The ED’s money laundering probe is linked to its coal scam case in which the prime accused Anup Majee is accused of illegally excavating coal from ECL leasehold areas of West Bengal and selling them to factories/plants located in Bankura, Bardhhaman, Purulia and other districts of Bengal.In a press release issued immediately afterwards its search and seizure operation was disrupted by Banerjee and senior state officials, the anti-money laundering agency said it had visited I-PAC’s office to follow up its finding that “one hawala operator linked to layering of proceeds of crime of coal smuggling had facilitated transactions of tens of crores of rupees to Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC)”.The agency said the search covered persons linked to generation of coal smuggling proceeds, hawala operators and handlers. “I-PAC is also one of the entities linked to hawala money,” it added.“Ms Banerjee entered residential premises of Pratik Jain and took away evidence, including physical documents and electronic devices.

"Activist in jail for 7 years sans trial, SC steps in to hasten proceedings",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/activist-in-jail-for-7-yrs-sans-trial-sc-steps-in-to-hasten-proceedings/articleshow/127058692.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Wednesday said it would pass an order to expedite proceedings against lawyer-activist Surendra Gadling in the 2016 Surajgarh arson case after he pressed for bail on the ground that he has been in jail for seven years without trial and there is also no judge in the special court to hear the matter.A bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and Vijay Bishnoi said it will talk to the chief justice of Bombay HC for the appointment of a judge and pass an order to expedite the hearing. Senior advocate Anand Grover said the activist is in jail for seven years and proceedings in the case are not moving forward as video conferencing facility is not working and there is no judge to preside over the special court. Though he said it was a fit case for bail, the bench said it would fast-track the hearing in the special (trial) court.As the case is based on the same set of evidence that is being used in the Koregaon Bhima Elgar Parishad case, the evidence, including documentary and digital, have to be brought to the trial court in Gadchiroli from the NIA court in Mumbai. But Grover said the evidence has not been placed before the court concerned. SC said that it would pass an order for bringing the evidence and would grant one month to both the prosecution and the accused to examine the evidence and argue the case for framing of charges.The senior advocate said the liberty of his client was being violated, which is a serious matter. But SC was not inclined, and the lawyer then asked the bench to allow him to press for bail after a month.Amid inconsistent stands taken by SC on the issue of grant of bail due to delay in trial and long incarceration, the issue hangs in balance. A three-judge bench in 2021 had said in the K A Najeeb case that stringent conditions under Section 43-D(5) of the UAPA ""melt down"" as time passes and it does not oust the ability of the constitutional courts to grant bail on grounds of violation of fundamental rights. This ruling was followed in other cases, including in Manish Sisodia's case in which the court said long period of incarceration - running for around 17 months - and the trial even not starting, amounts to violation of right to speedy trial under Article 21 of the Constitution, making a fit case for bail.A division bench recently, while rejecting bail pleas of Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam held that delay in trial and long incarceration cannot be the sole ground to grant relief. But later, SC in another judgment held that an accused has fundamental right to speedy trial and it is not eclipsed by the nature of the offence.Gadling's bail plea is pending in SC since Oct 2023 when he filed an appeal against the Bombay HC order of denying him bail. The Surajgarh arson happened in Dec 2016 when around 39 vehicles engaged in transporting iron ore from the Surajgarh mines in Maharashtra's Gadchiroli were allegedly set on fire by Maoists. He has been booked for various offences under IPC and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).",Surendra Gadling has been in jail for seven years without trial and there is also no judge in the special court to hear the matter. The case is based on the same set of evidence that is being used in the Koregaon Bhima Elgar Parishad case. SC said that it would pass an order for bringing the evidence and would grant one month to both the prosecution and the accused.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127058963,imgsize-1302024,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

‘Protecting Rohingyas And Bangladeshis’: BJP MP Sambit Patra Slams Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee

slams parties protecting

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress leader Manirul Islam on Wednesday said the Election Commission will be ""hunted down from the netherworld"" and ""taught a lesson"" as the impasse continues between the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government and poll body over the Special Intensive Revision (SIR).Manirul Islam, threatening the Election Commission of India , is not his first brush with controversy, as the Farakka MLA was accused of leading a mob to the Block Development Office (BDO) in his constituency and ransacking the space, leaving officials injured last week.After the incident, BJP MLA Gouri Sankar attacked Mamata Banerjee for instigating her party cadres across the state to commit riots and violence.Lashing out at the ruling TMC over its MLA threatening the EC, the BJP on Wednesday accused CM Mamata Banerjee of ""asking her MLA to intimidate officials"".""Manirul Islam, a sitting TMC MLA, openly threatens the Election Commission of India, saying it will be “taught a lesson” and “hunted down from underground.” Mamata Banerjee as Home Minister is asking her MLA to intimidate officials! TMC protects illegal infiltrators!"" BJP's national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari posted on X.Manirul Islam's remark comes days after tension was reported over the submission of Form 7 across Bengal districts on Tuesday as Trinamool and BJP workers blocked roads and staged protests.The violence prompted Trinamool to appeal to people not to be ""provoked"".""The anger and frustration is understandable. But the fight has to be fought in courtrooms and on EVMs. CM Mamata Banerjee is fighting for you. Do not fall for provocation,"" said party spokesperson Kunal Ghosh.Leader of the Opposition in the West Bengal Assembly Suvendu Adhikari accused the TMC of unleashing ""statewide anarchy"" to derail the SIR exercise.At Mogra in Hooghly, BJP workers blocked GT Road and demanded they be given an opportunity to submit Form 7 in the presence of the central security force.Meanwhile, Mamata Banerjee personally addressed concerns over the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, urging district magistrates to ensure that voters face no inconvenience over ""logical discrepancies.""Banerjee made the remarks during an unexpected meeting with district magistrates at the state secretariat, Nabanna, which was chaired by chief secretary Nandini Chakraborty.""The CM made it clear that all hearings related to SIR must be conducted strictly in accordance with the apex court's directives. She specifically instructed officials to ensure that people are not put to inconvenience under the pretext of logical discrepancies,"" a senior official said.The Supreme Court had on Monday directed the Election Commission to display the names of those on the ‘logical discrepancies’ list at gram panchayat bhavans and block offices, where documents and objections can also be submitted. The apex court also granted electors an additional 10 days to submit documents to confirm their inclusion in the state electoral roll.The latest directions have brought relief to several voters in Kolkata who were summoned for hearings after discrepancies were found in their voter records.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday doubled down on his government's ambition to detect and deport illegal immigrants in the country, while strongly criticising the political parties ""protecting or covering up for illegal immigrants for the sake of vote bank politics"".Addressing the party workers after the new BJP chief Nitin Nabin took charge, PM Modi said: ""Illegal immigrants pose a great threat to the country's security. Identifying them and sending them back to their countries is absolutely essential.""""No country in the world accepts illegal immigrants. India, too, cannot allow illegal immigrants to steal the rights of our poor and our youth. Illegal immigrants pose a great threat to the country's security. Identifying them and sending them back to their countries is absolutely essential,"" PM Modi said during an address at the BJP headquarters.Without naming any political party, but in an apparent attack on Trinamool Congress (TMC), which rules the poll-bound West Bengal, PM Modi lashed out at parties ""covering up for illegal immigrants"" and said: ""We must expose them to the public"".","Manirul Islam, a sitting TMC MLA, openly threatens the Election Commission of India, saying it will be “taught a lesson” and “hunted down from underground” Mamata Banerjee as Home Minister is asking her MLA to intimidate officials!

Allow newspaper to function and take out editions, SC orders Punjab



NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed Punjab Kesari to continue operating one of its printing presses which was closed by the state pollution control board, allegedly for publishing an adverse report against the state government.Seeking urgent remedy from a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi asked for a stay on the order to close the press and a hotel run by the group. For Punjab govt, advocate general Maninderjit Singh Bedi and additional AG Shadan Farasat said liquor bottles were found in the printing press while the hotel had violated the pollution law.The bench said while it wasn’t excessively concerned about the hotel, the printing press can’t be shut down.Bedi said the newspaper had filed a writ petition before Punjab and Haryana HC, which heard the matter at length Monday and reserved its order. Rohatgi said the newspaper approached SC as the HC had refused to stay the closure of the printing press and the hotel at Jalandhar and Ludhiana.The bench said, “Don’t hamper publishing of the newspaper by closing one of its printing presses. Hotel being a commercial concern, we are not unduly bothered about it as law will take its course.Allow the newspaper to function and take out its editions.”When Farast reiterated that liquor bottles were found in the printing press, Rohatgi said the alleged recovery of two liquor bottles had led to the closure order. “The main reason ostensibly is the publication of a not favourable article in the newspaper,” he said.The bench allowed the printing press to continue operating while directing status quo with regard to the hotel.","Supreme Court allows Punjab Kesari to continue operating one of its printing presses.

PM Modi Signals Generational Shift As Nitin Nabin Becomes New BJP President, Calls Him His Boss

It may seem to people that Narendra Modi is the third-term PM of the country, he became CM at only 50 years of age and has been head of a govt for 25 continuous years. But above all this in my life is the fact that I am a BJP worker. This is my biggest pride, PM Modi said.He chose the occasion to emphasise the role of BJP’s organisational strength and discipline behind its rise, contrasting this with decline of Congress from the all-time high of over 400 parliamentary seats and nearly 50% votes in 1984 — the largest mandate for any political party — to its current struggle to win even 100 seats.“Congress can never introspect over its decline because it will raise questions over the family which has captured it. They keep looking for excuses. They have lost courage to look for even correct reasons behind their fall,” he said. LoP in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi has repeatedly blamed an alleged collusion of EC and BJP for “vote chori” behind Congress’s string of dismal poll shows.“This family rule is an enemy of democracy,” Modi said and recalled after BJP’s big win in 2002 Gujarat polls, when he was CM, he was at a meeting to review reasons for its loss in some seats.BJP started as a party with a difference and has become the preferred party of governance, he said, in a nod to its “unprecedented” strike rate in recent assembly and civic polls.Raising the issue of infiltration and demographic imbalance, which he had flagged at a recent rally in assembly poll-bound West Bengal, Modi said even rich and strong countries are deporting infiltrators. “The world does not question them for expelling infiltrators,” he said, adding that these nations would claim to be flag-bearers of democracy and act like “nawabs (lords)” of the world. No country accepts infiltrators, he said, without naming any nation. While US has launched an expansive crackdown on infiltrators, several wealthy countries are also tightening measures against them.Asserting that India, too, cannot allow illegals on its soil, he called them a big threat to national security. “We will have to expose parties that are shielding them for vote-bank politics,” he said.In the same breath, he also slammed “urban naxals”, saying they are acquiring international dimensions and conspiring to harm India. They must be defeated by the party’s organisational and ideological strength, he said. Maoism is in its last breath in the country, he said.Modi touched on a host of his govt’s welfare measures and said he is giving an account of his work to the new chief who will write his confidential report, drawing good cheers from the audience.","PM Narendra Modi visited Motihari, Siwan, Madhubani and Patna since April.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump has invited India to be part of a proposed international “Board of Peace” aimed at overseeing post-war governance and reconstruction in Gaza. The initiative forms a key pillar of Trump’s broader Gaza ceasefire plan and is now beginning to take shape, with the White House confirming the involvement of several global figures.In a letter, shared by US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor, Trump framed the initiative as part of a sweeping 20-point “Comprehensive Plan” to end the Gaza conflict, first announced in September last year. He said the plan had since received wide backing from global leaders across the Arab world, Israel and Europe, and was formally endorsed by the United Nations Security Council through Resolution 2803 in November.Trump wrote that the moment had come to “turn dreams into reality”, with the centrepiece of the initiative being the creation of an international “Board of Peace”. The body, Trump said, would be established as a new international organisation and transitional governing administration, tasked with delivering what he called “lasting peace” through governance reform, reconstruction and economic investment.""Now it is time to turn all of these Dreams into reality. At the heart of the Plan is The Board of Peace, the most impressive and consequential Board ever assembled, which will be established as a new International Organization and Transitional Governing Administration,"" the letter read.The invitation places India among a growing list of countries and global figures being courted by Washington as Trump seeks to operationalise a 20-point “Comprehensive Plan” aimed at ending the Gaza conflict and managing the transition to long-term stability.According to the White House, the Board of Peace will serve as the central strategic body overseeing Gaza’s post-war transition. Chaired by Trump himself, it is expected to focus on governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment mobilisation and large-scale funding.Confirmed members include US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump’s special negotiator Steve Witkoff, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, former UK prime minister Tony Blair, billionaire financier Marc Rowan, World Bank president Ajay Banga and senior National Security Council aide Robert Gabriel. More appointments are expected in the coming weeks.Alongside the main board, two additional structures have been announced. The National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), led by Palestinian technocrat Dr Ali Sha’ath, will oversee the restoration of public services, rebuilding of civil institutions and stabilisation of daily life in Gaza. The White House has described this as a key step in implementing Phase Two of Trump’s plan.A separate Gaza Executive Board will support governance delivery on the ground and includes international diplomats and regional figures from Turkey, Qatar, Egypt, Israel and the UAE, as well as UN humanitarian coordinator Sigrid Kaag.Apart from India several countries including Argentina, Canada, Egypt, Turkey, Albania and Cyprus have been invited. Pakistan has also been invited to join the Board of Peace. Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that the prime minister received the invitation, adding that Pakistan will continue supporting international efforts for peace and security in Gaza.As per a report by Bloomberg, a draft charter proposes of the Trump-led “Board of Peace,” allegedly requires nations to contribute $1 billion to secure long-term membership.

Iran Broadcast Breached: State TV Hacked As Opposition Airs Reza Pahlavi Protest Message Nationwide

State TV satellite broadcast disrupted

Crackdown death toll rises sharply

Fears of executions and a police ultimatum

International backlash and Davos snub

US aircraft carrier movement raises tensions





Iran is facing one of its gravest crises in decades as nationwide protests, a deadly crackdown by authorities, cyber disruptions to state television and rising international pressure converge amid an ongoing internet shutdown.Activists say the death toll from the unrest has crossed 4,000, while tensions between Tehran and Washington remain elevated.Hackers disrupted Iranian state television satellite transmissions, briefly airing footage supporting exiled crown prince Reza Pahlavi and urging security forces not to “point your weapons at the people,” online videos showed early Monday, as per news agency AP.The footage appeared across multiple satellite-broadcast channels of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting and included clips of security personnel, claiming some had laid down their weapons.The semiofficial Fars news agency acknowledged the signal disruption in “some areas of the country,” but did not specify what was broadcast.Pahlavi’s office confirmed the appearance of the footage but did not comment on the hacking.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said at least 4,029 people have been killed in the crackdown on protests, with fears the toll could rise further as information emerges despite the internet shutdown, according to AP.Of those killed, 3,786 were demonstrators, 180 security personnel, 28 children and 35 non-protesters. The agency also said more than 26,000 people have been arrested.Iranian officials have not released an official death toll. Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the protests had left “several thousand” people dead and blamed the United States.Concerns have grown over possible executions of detainees. Iran’s top police officer Ahmad-Reza Radan issued an ultimatum to protesters deemed “deceived,” asking them to surrender within three days for leniency or face severe punishment, reported news agency AFP.A joint statement from Iran’s president, judiciary chief and parliament speaker said that while “killers and seditious terrorists will be punished,” leniency would be shown to those misled into participating.Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi had his invitation to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos withdrawn due to the killings. “It is not right for the Iranian government to be represented at Davos this year,” the forum said, as per AP.Araghchi denounced the move, alleging political pressure. The Munich Security Conference also withdrew invitations for Iranian officials.Amid rising tensions, ship-tracking data analysed by AP showed the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier entering the Strait of Malacca, potentially en route to the Middle East.The USS Abraham Lincoln was stationed in the South China Sea with its strike group to deter China amid rising tensions with Taiwan.Now, the tracking data shows that the USS Frank E Petersen Jr, USS Michael Murphy, and USS Spruance, all guided missile destroyers, are accompanying the Lincoln through the strait.Multiple US media reports from anonymous officials say the Lincoln, which is based in San Diego, is heading to the Middle East. It will take several days before its aircraft are within range of that region.Currently, the Middle East does not have an aircraft carrier group or an amphibious ready group, which complicates any talks about a military operation against Iran, especially since Gulf Arab states generally oppose such an attack.Earlier, US President Donald Trump warned Tehran against killing peaceful protesters or carrying out mass executions following the unrest.

Barron Trump helped save a woman’s life after witnessing her being attacked during a FaceTime call and alerting British police, according to a London court.The youngest son of US President Donald Trump contacted UK emergency services after receiving a late-night call from a woman he knew, during which he allegedly saw her ex-boyfriend assaulting her. The call to police was made at 2.23 am on January 18, 2025, reports Metro UK.The woman cannot be named for legal reasons. She said that her ex-boyfriend, Matvei Rumiantsev, had been attacking her when she managed to reach Barron Trump. Prosecutors said 22-year-old Rumiantsev was jealous of her friendship with the US president’s son.In the emergency call played to the court, Barron Trump dialled a 999 operator and said: “I just got a call from a girl I know. She’s getting beaten up.” After giving her address, he added: “It’s really an emergency, please. I got a call from her with a guy beating her up.”Bodycam footage from police officers arriving at the address was also shown to jurors. She later told them: “I am friends with Barron Trump, Donald Trump’s son.”One officer was heard saying to a colleague: “So apparently this informant from America is likely to be Donald Trump’s son.”He added: “This female is friends with Donald Trump’s son.

I picked up the phone expecting a nice hello or something,” he said.He added: “I just saw a ceiling and could hear screaming. I could see a guy’s head on the phone, and then the camera turns to her crying and getting hit.”He said the call lasted 10 to 15 seconds. “I called you guys – that was the best thing I could do. I wasn’t going to call back and threaten things to him because that would just make the situation worse,” he added.Giving evidence, the woman described the call as “a sign from God”. She told the jury: “He helped save my life. That call was like a sign from God at that moment.” She said she had been “on my knees begging” before managing to get back up.The woman had been in a six-month relationship with Rumiantsev and later accused him of assault, rape, intentional strangulation and attempting to pressure her into withdrawing her complaints.

KOZHIKODE: Police on Wednesday arrested Shimjitha Mustafa, who is facing suicide abetment charges in connection with the death of 41-year-old Govindapuram-native U Deepak after she posted a social media video alleging sexual harassment on a private bus.Medical College police in plain clothes apprehended Mustafa, 35, a resident of Valachukettiyil house, Chorode in Vadakara, from a relative's house on Wednesday afternoon. She had been absconding since Monday when police registered a case against her for abetment of suicide.The woman, former member of Areekode panchayat in Malappuram, had filmed Deepak, a sales executive with a textile firm, during a bus journey last Friday and later shared the video on social media. She alleged that he touched her inappropriately during the journey at Payyanur in Kannur.

BHUBANESWAR: More than two weeks after a pastor was allegedly assaulted and publicly humiliated on allegations of forced religious conversion in Dhenkanal district, police on Wednesday detained four persons.Dhenkanal SP Abhinav Sonkar said the suspects were being interrogated and added that ""further inquiry into the matter is on,"" without elaborating.In a complaint submitted to the superintendent of police on Jan 13, the pastor's wife alleged inaction by local police in connection with the Jan 4 incident, in which a mob of 15-20 people allegedly assaulted her husband, smeared sindoor on his face, garlanded him with footwear and paraded him through the village.She further alleged that the group forced him to drink drain water and bow before a temple against his will, while accusing him of involvement in forced religious conversion.According to the complaint, the pastor had gone to a local resident's house on Jan 4 after being invited to offer prayers for his good health.While the prayers were underway, the mob allegedly arrived armed with sticks, assaulted him and subjected him to public humiliation.The accusations of forced conversion were termed baseless by the complainant, who also alleged that police reached the spot much later.The pastor's wife told police that although she had lodged a complaint at Parjang police station on the day of the incident, no action followed for several days, prompting her and the victim to approach the SP. An FIR was subsequently registered on Jan 13.The incident triggered sharp political reactions. Congress, in a post on X, termed the episode ""a new low"" and alleged that the victim was compelled to eat cow dung. However, SP Sonkar said there was no allegation of cow dung being fed to the man.BJD also described the incident as unfortunate. Party spokesperson Lenin Mohanty said it was not reflective of Odia Asmita and warned that such incidents in a peaceful state like Odisha were damaging its image and amounted to serious human rights violations. He urged the double-engine government to act promptly.Responding, BJP state media in-charge Sujit Das accused the opposition of politicising the issue. ""Law enforcement agencies will act as per law, without fear or favour. They should be allowed to work without such politicization,"" he said.The Rashtriya Christian Morcha, Odisha unit, also demanded immediate action against the accused.

A quiet protest aimed at a big demand

Greenland Deal DONE, Europe Blindsided? Trump Drops Bombshell Details After Talks With NATO Chief

Growing tensions and public pushback

A simple protest that keeps going





Every morning before sunrise in Nuuk, when the streets are still quiet and the sky is only beginning to lighten, Jens Kjeldsen turns up outside the small wooden US Consulate building with a simple but striking message. In the biting mid-winter cold, he stands with three flags, Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands, protesting against President Donald Trump’s renewed push to bring Greenland under US control.Kjeldsen, a 70-year-old retiree, has become an unexpected face of resistance in Greenland’s capital. His protest is not loud or chaotic. It is deliberate, routine, and deeply symbolic. By showing up daily, before most people even begin their day, he is making the point that Greenland’s future cannot be decided by external pressure or political power games.Greenland, the world’s largest island with a small population, has once again been pulled into international headlines after Trump revived his long-running interest in the territory. He has framed Greenland as strategically vital for US security in the Arctic, at a time when global powers are paying increasing attention to the region.For Kjeldsen, that shift in rhetoric is exactly why he believes his daily presence outside the consulate matters.He has positioned his protest as a peaceful refusal to accept the idea that Greenland can be treated as an asset to be acquired.The flags Kjeldsen carries are central to the message. Greenland and the Faroe Islands are part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and the three flags together represent that political structure and shared sovereignty. Kjeldsen has repeatedly emphasised that the three parts of the kingdom are meant to stand as equals, not as territories to be bargained over or pressured into a new arrangement.By bringing all three flags, he is signalling unity while rejecting any suggestion that Greenland can be separated from its people’s will through outside political demands.Trump’s Greenland rhetoric has added strain to Denmark’s relationship with Washington, raising fears of deeper disagreements among long-standing allies. For many in Greenland and Denmark, the issue is about more than territory. It is about national dignity, sovereignty, and the principle that political futures must be decided by the people who live there.In Nuuk, the protest mood has extended beyond one man. Wider demonstrations have taken place, with crowds gathering to show opposition to Trump’s claims and to reinforce the message that Greenland is not for sale.Kjeldsen’s protest stands out because of its simplicity. The setting is harsh, the cold is intense, and the hour is early. But he keeps coming back, turning his personal routine into a daily reminder that Greenland’s sovereignty is not a bargaining chip.In the pre-dawn darkness, with snow underfoot and flags moving in the wind, his message remains consistent and clear. Greenland’s identity and future belong to Greenlanders, not to foreign leaders looking for leverage or control.","Jens Kjeldsen, a 70-year-old retiree, has become an unexpected face of resistance in Greenland’s capital.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has condemned an anti-ICE protest that disrupted a worship service at Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota, saying the incident reflects what she described as growing hostility towards religion in US politics. In a post on X, Gabbard said one of the main reasons she left the Democratic Party was “their hostility towards God” and people trying to practise or strengthen their faith.Gabbard accused the protesters of trying to “intimidate and terrorise” churchgoers, including families, and called their behaviour “demoniac”. She said the demonstrators who entered the church during the service should be condemned and held accountable, describing the disruption as an attack on the right to worship freely.The incident took place on January 18, 2026, when protesters entered the sanctuary during a service, chanting slogans and holding signs. Church leaders said the interruption created fear among attendees and disrupted the service. The protest was tied to anger over immigration enforcement activity in the area, with demonstrators calling for ICE to leave the community.Following the disruption, the US Department of Justice launched an investigation into the incident, citing potential violations of laws meant to protect religious freedom and prevent intimidation at places of worship.Officials said they were reviewing whether federal civil rights statutes apply and whether charges could be brought.Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman who left the party in 2022, used the incident to renew her criticism of Democratic leaders, accusing them of undermining religious freedom and trying to remove faith from public life. Her comments have circulated widely online, with supporters calling the church disruption an unacceptable escalation, while critics argue the incident must be viewed in the wider context of public anger over immigration raids and federal enforcement tactics.The protest has become the latest flashpoint in a wider national debate over immigration enforcement, religious freedom, and how political activism is carried out in sensitive spaces such as churches.","Tulsi Gabbard condemned an anti-ICE protest that disrupted a worship service.

BENGALURU: A South Korean businesswoman has accused an airline ground-handling employee of sexually assaulting her at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport, allegedly under the pretext of “manual frisking”.The 32-year-old woman was returning to South Korea on Monday when the incident occurred in the international departures area of Terminal 2, shortly after she had cleared immigration and security checks.According to the woman’s complaint, the incident took place around 10.45am.A man approached her after she had completed Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) frisking and immigration formalities, identified himself as airport staff and asked to see her boarding pass.He then claimed there was a problem with her checked-in baggage, saying a beeping sound had been detected and that resolving the issue would take time.He allegedly suggested an alternative — what he described as “manual frisking” — and asked her to accompany him.Police said the woman was taken to an area near the men’s washroom. There, under the guise of inspection, the man allegedly touched her chest multiple times, asked her to turn around and then touched her private parts.When the woman objected, he allegedly hugged her, thanked her and told her she could leave.The Kempegowda International Airport police said the accused has been identified as Mohammed Affaann Ahmed, 25, a ground-handling staff member with Air India SATS.Police said he had no authority to physically inspect passengers.According to investigators, the woman later reported the incident to airport security staff, who immediately detained the accused and alerted airport police. CCTV footage from the terminal is said to corroborate key aspects of her account.A case has been registered against Ahmed under Section 75 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), which deals with sexual harassment. He was arrested and remanded to judicial custody, and has been lodged in Central Jail at Parappana Agrahara.Airport authorities said frisking and physical checks are conducted only by authorised CISF personnel and in the case of female passengers, by female staff.They said any airport employee who suspects an issue with a passenger or baggage is required to alert CISF or immigration officials and has no right to carry out physical checks.Police said the investigation is ongoing.","The 32-year-old woman was returning to South Korea on Monday when the incident occurred in the international departures area of Terminal 2.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday hit back at Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, saying Canada “lives because of the United States.”His comments came a day after Carney, speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Switzerland's Davos, criticised American “hegemony.”Trump, also speaking at the WEF in Davos, said Carney “wasn't so grateful” despite the US providing “many freebies.”“Canada gets many freebies from the US and should be grateful. His (Carney's) speech showed he wasn't so grateful. Canada lives because of the United States, remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements,” he remarked.The 2026 edition of the WEF Annual Meeting began on January 19 and will end on January 23. The summit is taking place against the backdrop of Trump’s threats to take control of Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory in the Arctic Ocean, citing national security concerns. Washington’s European allies have rallied behind Greenland and Denmark. In response, Trump announced 10% tariffs on Denmark and seven other European countries supporting Greenland and Denmark. The tariffs will take effect on February 1 and rise to 25% starting June 1.Trump, who began his second and final White House term in January last year, has also spoken about ""annexing"" Canada, America’s northern neighbour, and making it the “51st state” of the United States. He also imposed tariffs that have hit key Canadian sectors such as steel, aluminium, autos, and lumber, with Ottawa imposing retaliatory tariffs.","US President Donald Trump hit back at Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, saying Canada “lives because of the United States” His comments came a day after Carney, speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Switzerland's Davos, criticised American “hegemony” Trump said Carney “wasn't so grateful” despite the US providing “many freebies”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127005486,imgsize-199788,width-400,resizemode-4/donald-trump-at-wef.jpg"
Kalyan civic drama: UBT Sena cries 'betrayal of voters' as MNS extends support to Shinde Sena,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/ubt-sena-cries-betrayal-as-mns-backs-shinde-in-kdmc/articleshow/127096270.cms,"





KALYAN: The UBT Sena's Kalyan district chief Sharad Patil Wednesday accused MNS of betrayal after it extended its support to Shiv Sena in KDMC.Sena MP from Kalyan Shrikant Shinde said MNS had extended support in the interest of the city's development. Asked if Shiv Sena would form the local govt without the support of BJP which had won 50 seats, he said that Sena and BJP had contested the civic polls together as Mahayuti and that the mayor would be from Mahayuti. A final decision on the mayoral post would be taken by deputy CM Eknath Shinde and BJP state president Ravindra Chavan, he added.BJP state president Ravindra Chavan said the mayor in Kalyan-Dombivli, Ulhasnagar and Thane will be from the Mahayuti. He said a final decision will be taken after CM Devendra Fadnavis returns from Davos.All 53 Sena corporators in KDMC visited the Konkan divisional commissioner's office on Wednesday to complete the process of group registration. At the same venue, the five MNS corporators formed a separate group. While this process was on, MNS' Raju Patil held a meeting with Shrikant Shinde, after which MNS officially declared its support to Sena.Explaining MNS's stand, Raju Patil said the BJP had 50 seats and the Shinde-led Sena had 53, and for days, KDMC had witnessed political manoeuvring, including number games and alleged poaching. He said similar confusion could arise during formation of civic committees. ""To ensure stability and to facilitate development work, we have decided to extend support,"" Patil said.UBT Sena's Sharad Patil told TOI his party and MNS had contested the elections together and voters had voted against Shinde Sena and BJP. ""We sacrificed several of our Shiv Sainiks by denying them tickets to accommodate MNS candidates. By supporting Shinde Sena now, MNS has betrayed not only our party but also the voters who supported them,"" he alleged.He said that of the 11 UBT Sena corporators elected, four were not reachable. According to his information, he said, two of them were in touch with the MNS and two with the Shinde-led Sena. He said the party would initiate disqualification proceedings against them.Political observers said Wednesday's developments have raised questions over whether Sena is trying to gain a majority in the KDMC House independently or is seeking to strengthen its bargaining power within Mahayuti, especially after BJP's demand that it should get the mayor's post for a two-and-a-half-year term.Analysts also said that with Kalyan LS seat being with Shrikant Shinde and BJP demonstrating growing strength in the region-evident from its win in the council president's election in Ambernath and emergence as the single largest party in Ulhasnagar-the Sena leadership may be working to consolidate its position in the various contests over the mayor's posts and other important posts in civic bodies.",UBT Sena's Kalyan district chief Sharad Patil accused MNS of betrayal after it extended its support to Shiv Sena in KDMC.

Several people, including a young girl, are missing after a landslide struck a popular camping site at the base of Mauao, Mount Maunganui, in New Zealand’s North Island on Thursday morning, triggering a major emergency response.The slip occurred around 9.30 am (local time) at the Beachside Holiday Park, about 230 km south-east of Auckland, sweeping through campervans, cars, tents and an ablution block. Emergency services said sniffer dogs were deployed as rescuers searched for anyone trapped under the debris, reported ABC News.Fire and emergency commander William Pike said first responders heard voices from beneath the rubble when they arrived, but no further sounds since. “Nobody has been rescued yet,” he said, adding that crews would continue searching despite difficult conditions.Police district commander assistant commissioner Tim Anderson said the number of missing was still unclear but believed to be in single figures. Emergency management minister Mark Mitchell confirmed that a young girl was among those unaccounted for, with RNZ reporting that other children may also be missing.He added that parts of the east coast looked like “a war zone”, with helicopters deployed to rescue families sheltering on rooftops from flooding, and local states of emergency declared in five regions across Northland and the East Cape due to days of record-breaking torrential rain, reported The Guardian.Addressing reporters on Thursday afternoon, Mitchell said the operation remained focused on rescue. “We're still in a response phase, there is still a lot of activity going on, there's still a lot of work being done to understand exactly what damage has occurred,” he said.“We know that we've had multiple slips, infrastructure down, working hard to get power restored. “Obviously, a real priority is the recovery of people and the rescue operation that is happening.”Mitchell said geoscientists would carry out a full assessment before the area was reopened to the public, citing ongoing safety concerns due to unstable ground.Tauranga Mayor Mahé Drysdale described the situation as evolving, noting challenges in accounting for everyone at the campsite. “We're having to work through all the lists of those who are checked in. We don't know the exact number,” he said. He added that some campers may have left without formally checking out, complicating efforts to confirm who is missing.A local resident, Robyn, who lives near the campground, said she saw emergency crews digging through mud for about an hour before pausing. She said ambulances left the scene empty, while police remained on site.Witness Nix Jaques said she heard a loud noise just before seeing the hillside collapse. “I turned around, and I could see the land coming down onto some structures,” she said, adding that an ablution block and a nearby campervan were hit.St John Ambulance declared a major incident, with police, firefighters and paramedics responding. Fire and Emergency shift manager Paul Radden said about 40 firefighters, including an urban search and rescue team, were deployed.The Mount Maunganui Surf Life Saving Club has been set up as a triage and evacuation centre. The rest of the holiday park has been evacuated, and authorities have urged the public to stay away to ensure clear access for rescue teams.","Several people, including a young girl, are missing after a landslide struck a popular camping site at the base of Mauao, Mount Maunganui, in New Zealand’s North Island.

Reitz’s post drew angry reactions and accusations of targeting a specific community.According to the Community Note referenced in replies, Reitz’s donor list includes contributions linked to Anosh Ahmed, a Pakistani-American doctor who has been indicted in a Covid-era healthcare fraud case and is reported to have left the US and is currently living in Dubai.The note added fuel to the backlash, with users arguing that Reitz’s anti-immigration messaging was undermined by questions surrounding his campaign funding.Reitz has previously faced scrutiny over donations, including reports that he accepted nearly $100,000 from a Houston doctor accused by federal authorities of involvement in a medical fraud scheme worth nearly $300 million. Some users also circulated posts citing campaign finance records, claiming the donor was among Reitz’s top contributors.The episode has revived debate in Texas over immigration policy, legal work visas, and the role of highly skilled workers in the state’s economy, particularly in fast-growing tech hubs such as Austin and Dallas.Community Notes became a major embarrassment for the candidate, exposing what critics described as hypocrisy behind his post. Instead of a serious policy argument, Reitz’s remarks were widely seen as inflammatory identity politics, and the focus quickly shifted from his attacks on Indians to questions about why a fraud-linked Pakistani donor was among his biggest backers.","Aaron Reitz, a GOP candidate for Texas Attorney General, came under scrutiny after a screenshot of his remarks circulated widely on X.Community Notes.

‘Go back to your country’: 8-year-old Texas boy’s tearful video after anti-immigrant bullying goes viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/go-back-to-your-country-8-year-old-texas-boys-tearful-video-after-anti-immigrant-bullying-goes-viral/articleshow/127075988.cms,"Europe's 1st Big Retaliation Against U.S. On Greenland After Trump Speech At Davos | 'No Talks...'





A video of an eight-year-old boy breaking down in tears as he describes the anti-immigrant harassment he faced while playing football has gone viral online, prompting debate about bullying and the language children absorb from those around them.The clip, shared by CBS News on January 21, shows the boy, identified as Max, speaking to his mother after a youth match in Texas. In the footage, Max says another child called him an “illegal immigrant” and told him to “go back to your country”, despite the fact that he was born in the US.His mother, who filmed the moment, said she did not record or post the video to stir controversy, but to highlight how deeply words can affect children. She said she wanted people to reflect on the impact of what they say and do, particularly when young people are affected.In the video, Max appears overwhelmed as he explains what was said to him during the game. His mother can be heard trying to comfort him, encouraging him to express his feelings while reassuring him that he belongs.The clip quickly spread across social media and attracted a wave of comments. Some users expressed sympathy for Max and praised his mother for sharing the video, while others criticised the post and questioned her reasons for publishing it.The incident has gained attention amid heightened political tensions in the US around immigration enforcement and border policy. While the boy’s experience took place during a local youth sports match, many viewers linked it to wider discussions about immigration rhetoric and its effects on communities.Max’s mother said she understood that reactions would vary, but maintained that her goal was straightforward. She said she wanted the video to serve as a reminder that words spoken casually, including by children repeating what they hear, can have a lasting impact.As the clip continues to circulate online, she has urged people to focus on the message she intended to highlight: how bullying and hostile language can affect children, and the importance of addressing it.","Boy, 8, breaks down in tears as he describes anti-immigrant harassment he faced while playing football in Texas.

'Trump Still A Friend': Netanyahu Publicly Opposes U.S. Board Of Peace For Gaza Governance





Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday issued a stern warning to Iran’s Khamenei-led regime, vowing an “unprecedented” response if Tehran attacks Israel, Xinhua reported.Addressing the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, Netanyahu said, “If it makes a mistake and attacks us, we will act with a force it has not yet known.”He said Israel was “closely” monitoring Iran, cautioning that “no one can predict what the future holds for Iran, but it will not return to what it once was,” a remark suggesting irreversible consequences for Tehran in the event of a conflict.The comments came as the United States was reportedly moving the nuclear-powered USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group toward the Middle East amid escalating tensions with Iran.Separately, Netanyahu addressed US-led proposals for Gaza’s post-war governance, under which Turkish and Qatari officials have been cited as potential participants in the US President Donald Trump-chaired “Board of Peace.”“We have a certain disagreement with our friends in the United States over the composition of the advisory board that will accompany the processes in Gaza,” Netanyahu said, adding that neither Turkish nor Qatari soldiers would be permitted to operate in the enclave.Israel has consistently opposed any Turkish role in Gaza and maintains uneasy ties with Qatar, despite Turkey and Qatar being among the key mediators between Israel and Hamas.","'If it makes a mistake and attacks us, we will act with a force it has not yet known,' Netanyahu says.

Trump’s Greenland 'Military Takeover’ Ignites MAGA? Johnson Says 'Not Appropriate' As NATO Panics





Has MAGA found a new meaning? Protesters in Denmark have taken to the streets to oppose US President Donald Trump ’s rigid push to acquire the Arctic island -- Greenland, wearing red baseball caps spoofing his iconic MAGA hats -- this time emblazoned with the slogan “Make America Go Away.”MAGA hats have become symbolic of Danish and Greenlandic defiance against the US president’s threat to seize the Arctic territory.The caps reading “Make America Go Away,” a parody of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, have gained popularity on social media and at public protests, including a weekend demonstration in freezing weather in the Danish capital.Several European countries have also joined Denmark and Greenland in pushing back against Donald Trump, stressing the need to defend the Arctic and warning that threats to Greenland undermine Western security.Protesters, however, have been far more blunt.“I want to show my support to Greenland and also show that I don’t like the president of the United States,” ABC news quoted a 76-year-old Copenhagen resident Lars Hermansen, who wore one of the red caps at a protest on Saturday.The mock hats were created by Jesper Rabe Tonnesen, a vintage clothing store owner in Copenhagen. At first, the idea failed, with early batches last year drawing little interest.That changed after the Trump administration recently stepped up its rhetoric over Greenland. Since then, the caps have appeared widely at protests and online.“When a delegation from America went up to Greenland, we started to realize this probably wasn’t a joke -- it’s not reality TV, it’s actually reality,” said Tonnesen, 58. “So I said, OK, what can I do? Can I communicate in a funny way with a good message and unite the Danes to show that Danish people support the people of Greenland?”Demand quickly jumped from almost nothing to selling out within a single weekend. Tonnesen said he has now ordered “several thousand” more.The first version of the cap designed by Tonnesen carried a wordplay slogan, “Nu det NUUK!” a twist on the Danish phrase “Nu det nok,” meaning “Now it’s enough,” replacing the word with Nuuk, Greenland’s small capital.At Saturday’s rally, protesters waved red-and-white Danish and Greenlandic flags and held handmade signs mocking US claims over the territory, which is slightly larger than Saudi Arabia","Protesters in Denmark have taken to the streets to oppose US President Donald Trump’s push to acquire Greenland.

— Mel (@Villgecrazylady) January 18, 2026 A casual lunch turned into a frightening ordeal for five software engineers in Minneapolis last week after they were mistakenly labelled as federal immigration agents and confronted by an angry crowd outside the restaurant where they were dining. The incident, which took place at Clancy’s Deli near 38th Street and Grand Avenue South, highlights the heightened tensions over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in the Twin Cities as protests and community unrest escalate.According to accounts obtained by Alpha News, the group of software engineers, all white males dressed casually, were quietly eating lunch when one of the men received a message on an anti-ICE Signal chat group claiming that plainclothes ICE agents were inside the restaurant.

In this climate, misinformation and real-time alerts from activist networks can spark rapid, sometimes volatile public responses, as seen in the Clancy’s Deli episode. Anti-ICE protester groups have been mobilising quickly via encrypted messaging apps to track and confront perceived federal agents but incidents like this highlight the risk of misidentification and escalation when tensions run high.

The software engineers involved described mixed political views within their group, with some identifying as anti-ICE and others as neutral or supportive of immigration enforcement, underscoring the unpredictable consequences of such confrontations. Lee said the incident has forced some in the group to rethink their positions amid the volatile local climate.

What comes next

As Minneapolis grapples with ongoing protests, federal enforcement actions and community divisions, this episode serves as a stark reminder of how quickly everyday situations can spiral into dangerous confrontations. Local authorities have been balancing enforcement with public safety protocols, including a recent federal court ruling limiting the arrest powers of DHS agents against peaceful protesters, underscoring both legal and social complexities in the region.

What began as a quiet lunch for a group of tech workers has become another headline in a city struggling with deep divisions over immigration policies, law enforcement presence and citizen activism. Whether viewed as a cautionary tale about misinformation or a symptom of escalating public distrust in federal agencies, the incident has captured public attention and sparked debate over protest tactics, civil liberties and community safety.





The incident is not isolated; it comes amid a broader wave of anti-ICE activism and backlash in Minneapolis triggered by increased federal immigration enforcement. Earlier this month, the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent during an enforcement operation drew national attention, intensifying community anger and protest activity throughout the city.Social media reaction to the incident was swift and sharply divided, with the story igniting fierce debate across X (formerly Twitter), Reddit and conservative and progressive forums alike. Critics of the protesters described the confrontation as a chilling example of “mob justice”, warning that viral Signal alerts and online callouts are increasingly putting ordinary civilians at risk based on assumptions alone.Many users expressed alarm at how quickly a false accusation escalated into public harassment, with some calling it a failure of crowd restraint and accountability in activist spaces. On the other side, some anti-ICE voices argued that heightened vigilance was a byproduct of aggressive immigration enforcement and mistrust of authorities, though even among them, several conceded that misidentification and intimidation crossed a line.While one X user commented, ""Five random White guys eating lunch in Minnesota get reported as “undercover ICE agents” to an anti-ICE Signal chat by the restaurant’s owner and the next thing they know a mob has showed up to accost them. And because Minneapolis has a “no cooperation with ICE policy” the local police are avoiding situations like this altogether- leaving regular citizens to fend for themselves and deal with these psychotic gangs of social justice warriors (sic)"", another wrote, ""It is a Maoist cultural revolution. Citizens forced into struggle sessions by the Democratic Red Guard (sic)"" and yet another tweeted, ""“…the encounter left some of them reconsidering their positions.” I would certainly hope so. If not, I don’t know what it would take (sic).""The episode has since become a flashpoint in the broader online debate over protest culture, misinformation, and whether social media–fuelled rapid-response activism is eroding basic norms of due process and personal safety.Minneapolis has become a flashpoint in the nationwide debate over immigration enforcement. Federal operations known as Operation Metro Surge have deployed thousands of immigration agents in the region, resulting in widespread protests, legal battles, and public safety concerns. The broader atmosphere has become fraught, with immigrant communities and local residents voicing strong opposition to ICE tactics and federal intervention.","Five software engineers were mistakenly labelled as federal immigration agents and confronted by an angry crowd outside the restaurant where they were dining.

NATO Surrenders Before Trump? ‘Only 34 Troops To Defend Greenland From US…’ | Shock Announcement





US President Donald Trump has written a blunt letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, linking the Nobel Committee’s decision not to award him the Nobel Peace Prize to his hardened stance on Greenland, saying he no longer feels bound to “think purely of Peace”.According to a copy of the letter obtained by Bloomberg, Trump’s message to the Norwegian leader — first reported by a PBS journalist on X — was circulated by the US National Security Council (NSC) to several other European governments, underscoring Washington’s intent to make the communication widely known.“Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a “right of ownership” anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.Thank you! President DJT,” Trump wrote according to Bloomberg.Reacting to the letter, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said Trump’s message was sent in response to a brief text message he had earlier conveyed to the US President.“Trump’s message came in response to a short text message to President Trump from me earlier in the day, on behalf of myself and the President of Finland, Alexander Stubb,” Støre said.Støre underlined that Trump had been repeatedly informed that the Nobel Peace Prize decision does not rest with the Norwegian government.“I have repeatedly clearly explained to Trump that it is an independent committee that awards the Nobel Peace Prize,” he said.Norway had expressed disbelief last week after Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado handed her medal to US President Donald Trump, who has long coveted the award. Trump, who has repeatedly claimed he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for resolving multiple conflicts during his second term, accepted the medal during a meeting with the Venezuelan opposition leader at the White House.The move prompted a swift clarification from the Norwegian Nobel Committee.“The Nobel Prize and the laureate are inseparable,” the committee said in a statement on Friday. “Even if the medal or diploma later comes into someone else’s possession, this does not alter who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.”Trump’s letter to Norway PM follows a series of public statements in which he has accused Denmark of failing to counter what he describes as a Russian security threat in the Arctic.Earlier on Sunday, Trump said Denmark had not been able to do anything to remove the “Russian threat” from Greenland and added, “Now it is time, and it will be done!!!”“NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that ‘you have to get Russian threat away from Greenland.’ Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it,” Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social.Trump has repeatedly said he will settle for nothing less than ownership of Greenland, an autonomous territory that remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark.Leaders in both Denmark and Greenland have firmly rejected Trump’s position, insisting the island is not for sale and that Greenlanders do not wish to become part of the United States.The pressure campaign has also taken on an economic dimension. On Saturday, Trump vowed to impose a wave of escalating tariffs on European allies until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland.","US President Donald Trump has written a blunt letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.
