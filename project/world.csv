'Invitation to Patkar our main objection': BJP

'Never experienced anything like this': Medha Patkar

NEW DELHI: Objecting to the presence of social activist Medha Patkar , BJP MPs, including former Union minister Parshottam Rupala, stormed out of a parliamentary committee meeting on Tuesday, prompting the committee head to end the session.Some of the BJP MPs called Patkar an ""anti-national,"" and one wondered if the ""prime minister of Pakistan"" could also be called at such a meeting. She has long been accused by the ruling party of ""working against the country's development interests in the name of public and environmental causes.""The Standing Committee on Rural Development and Panchayati Raj, headed by Congress' Saptagiri Sankar Ulaka, had invited Patkar to present her views on the implementation and effectiveness of the land acquisition law enacted by Parliament when the Congress-led UPA government was in power in 2013.Defending his decide to invite Patkar, Ulaka told news agency PTI that as a standard practice, parliamentary panels hear civil society members and other stakeholders on various issues.He added, ""We wanted to hear their views on the land acquisition law. We wanted an opinion from everyone, but they (BJP) didn't allow it.""On his decision to cancel the session, the Congress parliamentarian stated that this was done as there was a lack of quorum.""As per rule, a quorum of 10 members is required. When the BJP MPs walked out, there was no quorum, and the meeting ended,"" Ulaka explained.A BJP member said their primary objection was to calling Patkar, who was the face of the 'Narmada Bachao Andolan' protest against a determined push by the Gujarat government, headed by the then-chief minister Narendra Modi, to raise the height of the Sardar Sarovar Dam.The Gujarat government finally prevailed, and Modi, who later took over as prime minister in 2014, has often spoken about the efforts to stall the project since its foundation was laid in the 1960s.According to a source, those invited before the panel included officials from the environment and forest ministry. Activists, including Patkar and actor Prakash Raj - he is a vocal BJP critic - were also asked to appear before the committee.When the meeting started, opposition members were of the opinion that Patkar should be heard. However, the saffron party did not agree.Asked about the incident, Patkar replied she was invited to appear before the panel, and while she and others were waiting, they saw some MPs leave.Later, they were informed that the meeting had ended, she added, and noted that she has appeared before parliamentary committees earlier as well.""I have never experienced anything like this before. It is important to talk about the land acquisition law,"" Patkar said.","BJP MPs stormed out of a parliamentary committee meeting on Tuesday, prompting the committee head to end the session.

Jaishankar’s Savage Declaration Of War At QUAD Meeting: ‘India Will Defend Its People’ | Watch

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday (Tuesday in the US) held a bilateral meeting with American secretary of defence Pete Hegseth at the Pentagon, where he underlined the strategic importance of India-US defence ties, describing them as ""one of the most consequential pillars"" of the bilateral relationship.During the meeting at the Pentagon, the foreign minister said: ""I am here for the QUAD meeting... just had a good session with our colleagues from Australia, Japan. I am here with you at the Pentagon because we believe that our defence partnership is today truly one of the most consequential pillars of our relationship.""The meeting came on the heels of the Quad Foreign Ministers' Meeting (QFMM) in Washington, marking another key engagement in a series of high-level India-US interactions.Hegseth expressed enthusiasm about the growing defence partnership between the two countries. He said the integration of US defence systems into India's armed forces and outlined the goal of expanding industrial cooperation and co-production networks.""The US is very pleased for the successful integration of many US defence items... building on this progress, we hope we can complete several major pending US defence sales to India, expand our shared defence industrial cooperation and co-production networks, strengthen interoperability...and formally sign a new framework of US-India major defence partnership,"" Hegseth said, according to news agency ANI.Hegseth said Washington was eager to work with New Delhi and that Jaishankar's visit was an ""important milestone in the ongoing series of high-level engagements""""We are eager to work alongside you to realise our shared goals. They are deep and ongoing. The visit today marks an important milestone in the ongoing series of high-level engagements between our two great countries,"" Hegseth said.Jaishankar also met with US state secretary Marco Rubio on the sidelines of Quad Foreign Ministers' Meeting (QFFM) in Washington and discussed bilateral partnership between both countries in the field of security, critical technologies, connectivity, energy and mobility.During Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the United States in February, he and President Donald Trump unveiled plans to formalise a new decade-long framework for the US-India major defence partnership.The two leaders hailed the growing integration of American-made defence systems into India’s arsenal, a list that now includes C-130J Super Hercules and C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft, P-8I maritime patrol planes, CH-47F Chinook and MH-60R Seahawk helicopters, AH-64E Apache attack helicopters, Harpoon missiles, M777 howitzers, and MQ-9B drones.Looking ahead, both nations also agreed to fast-track procurement and co-production deals for Javelin anti-tank guided missiles and Stryker infantry combat vehicles within India, aiming to swiftly bolster New Delhi’s defense capabilities this year.","S Jaishankar held a bilateral meeting with American secretary of defence Pete Hegseth at the Pentagon.

70% dip in Indians caught trying to enter US illegally in Jan-May 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/70-dip-in-indians-caught-trying-to-enter-us-illegally-in-jan-may-2025/articleshow/122191308.cms,"Anticipating Trump's return, many syndicates paused ops from late 2024

AHMEDABAD: The number of Indians caught crossing illegally into the US in the first five months of 2025 fell a whopping 70% over the same span last year following Donald Trump's return as President and his take-no-prisoners immigration policies. The number fell from 34,535 in Jan-May 2024 - when President Joe Biden was in office - to 10,382 in the same period of 2025.Yet, the fact that 10,382 Indians risked life and limb to sneak in even as the route becomes more perilous indicates the desperation to chase the American dream remains just as fierce. The count included at least 30 unaccompanied minors, many from Gujarat. The numbers have been released by US Customs and Border Protection (USCBP).The sharp drop coincides with the Trump administration's renewed crackdown on illegal immigration, which allegedly disrupted long-standing smuggling networks that cater to hopeful migrants from Gujarat.US Customs and Border Protection (USCBP) data shows a dramatic reversal in border encounters, with daily arrests of Indians dropping to around 69 from 230. Many of these syndicates paused their operations from late 2024, anticipating Trump's return.""The moment it became clear Trump would likely win again, routes started drying up,"" a source connected to a Gujarat-based human smuggling ring told TOI. ""People still want to go, but smugglers have either scaled back or raised costs, and the fear of stricter deportation is real. ""The broader impact is also visible in USCBP's overall data, which show the number of illegal immigrants (across all nationalities) apprehended dropped sharply over the same five-month period of 2025. Such arrests fell from 81,492 in Jan to 28,617 in Feb, 29,021 in March, 29,218 in April, and 29,502 in May.Yet for many Indians, especially from Gujarat, the dream of a better life across the border remains irresistible, and often fatal. On May 9, a boat carrying illegal migrants capsized near Del Mar, California, killing 14-year-old Prince and 10-year-old Mahi.Their parents, Brijesh and Sangita Patel, survived the wreck with grievous injuries. The deaths are not isolated. At least nine people from Gujarat are confirmed to have died while trying to cross the US border since Jan 2025.Of the at least 30 unaccompanied minors caught this year, agents said some were probably abandoned by adult companions during the perilous journey. In some cases, smugglers encouraged families to separate in hopes that minors would be treated more leniently under US immigration rules.According to officials, Gujarat continues to be one of the main sources of such illegal migration. ""Over the past decade, networks of agents have established overland routes through Central America,"" an official said.","The number fell from 34,535 in Jan-May 2024 - when President Joe Biden was in office - to 10,382 in the same period of 2025.

'Cops not bhagwan': CAT quashes IG's suspension for RCB stampede,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cops-not-bhagwan-cat-quashes-igs-suspension-for-rcb-stampede/articleshow/122191329.cms,"RCB invite drew '3-5L people' to B'luru stadium, says tribunal

BENGALURU: Central Administrative Tribunal Tuesday quashed the suspension order of senior IPS officer Vikash Kumar Vikash and held Royal Challengers Bengaluru responsible for the ""unexpected congregation"" outside Chinnaswamy Stadium, which led to the death of 11 fans on June 4.CM Siddaramaiah said there's scope for appealing against the order, indicating the government would pursue legal options.Also read: Bengaluru stampede: Tribunal says police not 'Aladdin ka Chirag'; blames RCB for chaos Following the stampede and public outcry, state govt had on June 5 suspended Vikash (inspector general & additional commissioner of police, west, Bengaluru City) and four other officials, including Bengaluru (City) police commissioner B Dayananda.CAT, a quasi-judicial body that redresses officers' grievances, said govt passed the suspension order in ""a mechanical manner"" and added that police personnel were only human and not 'bhagwan' or 'magicians'The tribunal observed that due to RCB inviting people through social media posts, ""3 to 5 lakh people"" gathered outside the stadium, which has a capacity of 35,000. Prima facie, it appeared RCB was responsible for the gathering of lakhs of people without seeking permission or consent from police. ""Due to shortage of time on June 4, police were unable to make appropriate arrangements.

He further added that the order was issued without a show-cause notice and contended that suspension is an extreme measure imposed in cases of grave misconduct.Also read: Suspension of IPS officer Vikash Kumar Vikash revoked; tribunal urges review of action against others officers State govt had said, as per police manual, the primary duty of the police is to prevent crime.

The tribunal noted that KSCA had submitted only a letter, which didn't contain any request seeking permission or for making arrangements. Therefore, it was not expected that police would make all arrangements suddenly. At the time of passing the order, there was no material suggesting negligence of the police officers concerned, CAT said.","Central Administrative Tribunal quashes suspension order of senior IPS officer Vikash Kumar Vikash.

NEW DELHI: In a disturbing detail that has emerged from the gangrape case at South Calcutta Law College, police said CCTV footage confirmed that one of the accused, Zaib Ahmed, left the crime scene briefly to buy an inhaler for the victim. He went to a medical store to buy inhaler after she pleaded for relief from breathlessness during the alleged assault.According to investigators, the footage from a nearby medical shop showed Zaib purchasing the inhaler at the victim's request, following her deteriorating condition inside the security guard’s room where the assault took place on the evening of June 25.“The victim said she had begged for medical help after falling ill during the torture. The accused denied taking her to a hospital but did get her an inhaler from a pharmacy. She felt better temporarily, but the torture continued,” a senior officer told news agency PTI.The pharmacy owner told police that Zaib attempted to split the payment, partly in cash and partly through UPI, but eventually paid the full amount online. Investigators have documented the transaction and matched it with the time of the assault.Meanwhile, medical reports have revealed fresh nail scratch marks on the body of the prime accused, Monojit Mishra, indicating the victim put up resistance during the attack. “Such injuries are consistent with a struggle,” a police source told PTI.The Special Investigation Team (SIT) has uncovered that Monojit contacted the college's vice principal, Dr Nayna Chatterji, the morning after the incident. The two have since been questioned regarding their conversation.Investigators are also questioning 16 individuals, mostly students, seen in the college premises via CCTV footage after class hours on June 25. Six were interrogated on Tuesday.Kolkata police commissioner Manoj Verma confirmed that digital, circumstantial, and medical evidence gathered so far aligns with the victim’s official complaint. “The matter is extremely sensitive. But I can confirm that arrests were made within 12 hours of the FIR,” he said.Three men, Monojit Mishra, Zaib Ahmed, and Pramit Mukhopadhyay, are in custody, along with a security guard, Pinaki Bandyopadhyay, who was on duty during the assault. Police have sought a 10-day extension of their remand.Additionally the police custody of the three acussed has been extended till July 8.","CCTV footage shows one of the accused, Zaib Ahmed, buying an inhaler for the victim.

"Expect Quad to appreciate India stand, says EAM",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/expect-quad-to-appreciate-india-stand-says-eam/articleshow/122191923.cms,"Won't deal with terrorists as proxies: EAM

NEW DELHI: India will exercise its right to defend its citizens from terrorism , and it expects Quad partners to understand and appreciate that, external affairs minister S Jaishankar told his Quad counterparts in Washington. Going into the Quad foreign ministers' meeting - ahead of the summit that India will host later this year - the minister drew attention to the recent Pahalgam terrorist attack, saying the world must display zero tolerance.""Victims and perpetrators must never be equated. And India has every right to defend its people against terrorism, and we will exercise that right. We expect our Quad partners to understand and appreciate that,"" the minister said in his opening remarks.Victims and perpetrators must never be equated, EAM Jaishankar said while speaking alongside American secretary of state Marco Rubio and his Australian and Japanese counterparts, Penny Wong and Takeshi Iwaya, respectively.Jaishankar's comments about India's expectations from Quad partners on the issue of terror are significant in the light of recent remarks by US President Donald Trump that seemed to draw an equivalence between India and Pakistan.Also, while Quad countries individually condemned the attack, India would have ideally liked them to do so in a joint statement.Earlier, in a conversation with US magazine Newsweek, the minister bluntly said India would not let the West's fear of a nuclear conflagration constrain its response to future Pakistan-backed terror attacks. ""We are very clear there will be no impunity for terrorists, that we will not deal with them any longer as proxies and spare the govt which supports and finances and, in many ways, motivates them. We will not allow nuclear blackmail to prevent us from responding,"" he said.""We've also heard this for too long... therefore the other guys will come and do horrible things, but you must not do anything because it gets the world worried. Now, we are not going to fall for that. If he is going to come and do things, we are going to go there and hit the people who did this. So no yielding to nuclear blackmail, no impunity to terrorists, no more free pass that they are proxies. And we will do what we have to do to defend our people,"" Jaishankar said. Speaking about Quad, the minister said it was committed to ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific. ""To that end, our endeavours are devoted to promoting a rules-based international order. It is essential that nations of the Indo-Pacific have the freedom of choice, so essential to make right decisions on development and security,"" he said.Even as India and others deny that Quad is a security alliance, both Beijing and Moscow see the grouping's primary objective as containment of China. In his remarks, The EAM highlighted progress in Quad initiatives, including in the maritime domain, logistics, education and political coordination. ""India plans to host the next Quad summit. We have some proposals on how to make that productive. I am sure, so do our partners,"" he added.","India will exercise its right to defend its citizens from terrorism, external affairs minister S Jaishankar told Quad counterparts in Washington.

NEW DELHI: The death of Ajith Kumar, a temple guard who allegedly died in police custody in Tamil Nadu's Sivaganga, has sparked concerns across the city.Relatives of Ajith Kumar, employed as a security guard at the Madapuram Kaliamman temple in Tirupuvanam, have alleged that the 28-year-old man died after being beaten and tortured during interrogation by police. .Ajit Kumar was initially detained for questioning regarding a theft at the Madapuram Kaliamman temple, the district Superintendent of Police said.Actor turned politician Vijay demanded for special investigation team in the Kumar's custodial death case. In a post on X he said that the Ajith kumar custodial death case has raised numerous questions in the minds of the public and starkly highlights the extent to which the Tamil Nadu Police Department, operating under the direct supervision of MK Stalin, ""acts in a cruel, utterly inhumane, and unjust manner"" toward ordinary citizens, functioning as an unethical institution.""It is widely known that the Tamil Nadu government initially tried to protect the culprits. Only after pressure from various political parties, including the Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam, and the intervention of the Madurai Bench of the High Court did the police department begin taking action,"" he said.""That is the current status of the various custodial death cases that have occurred during this regime? Has this government ensured that murder charges have been filed against all those accused in these cases and delivered justice to the victims? In a situation where the judges of the Madurai Bench of the High Court have expressed dissatisfaction, noting that 24 people have died in police custody over the past four years, the Tamil Nadu Home Minister must immediately release a white paper regarding the deaths of these 24 individuals,"" he added.He recalled the Anna University student sexual assault case and said that because a special investigation team was formed under the direct supervision of the High Court, an inquiry was conducted, and a swift judgment was delivered, and so will happen in this case as well.""I solemnly warn that in the 2026 Assembly elections, the people will gift the anarchic regime led by Mr. M.K. Stalin, which oppresses ordinary citizens through the abuse of power, a defeat so unprecedented that the DMK could not even imagine it in Tamil Nadu’s history,"" he said.The Tamil Nadu administration has removed Sivaganga District Superintendent of Police, Ashish Rawat from his position and placed him on ""compulsory wait"" at the DGP's office in Chennai.The action follows the alleged custodial death of Ajith Kumar, who worked as a temple security guard in Tamil Nadu's Sivagangai district.The authorities have assigned Ramanathapuram SP, G Chandeesh, additional responsibility as the Superintendent of Police for Sivagangai district.The investigation of the custodial death case in Sivaganga district has been handed over to CB-CID (Crime Branch, Crime Investigation Department) for further probe.The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court convened to examine a suo motu case regarding the suspected custodial death of Ajith Kumar, a temple security guard in Tamil Nadu's Sivagangai district.At the proceedings, advocate Henri Tiphagne presented photographic evidence suggesting that Ajith Kumar had been subjected to assault with plastic pipes and iron rods. The court viewed video footage depicting police personnel assaulting Ajith Kumar.A previous petition filed by advocate Marish Kumar in this matter remains under consideration.Additionally, advocate Henri Tiphagne has submitted a petition requesting to join as a petitioner, which is also under consideration.During the proceedings, the court questioned the failure of police authorities to register a case despite receiving a jewellery theft complaint.Following the alleged custodial death of Ajith Kumar, the state government has confirmed the arrest of five police officers.""In connection with the alleged custodial death of Ajith Kumar, who died during an inquiry conducted on 28th June in Sivaganga district, six police personnel were immediately suspended from duty on the same day. Based on the findings of the post-mortem, the case has now been converted into a criminal case, and five police personnel have been arrested in connection with the incident. The case has been officially registered at the Tirupuvanam Police Station under Section 196(2)(a) of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) Act, and has been forwarded for judicial investigation,"" the Tamil Nadu government said.","Actor turned politician Vijay demands for special investigation team in custodial death case.

“Their body language suggest something…”: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's subtle body language during NYC dinner hints at their true connection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/their-body-language-suggest-something-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelces-subtle-body-language-during-nyc-dinner-hints-at-their-true-connection/articleshow/122148909.cms,"Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's recent Manhattan outing has sparked discussions about their relationship's potential (TheImageDirect.com)

Body language expert says Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are showing signs of lasting love

Over the weekend, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce lit up Manhattan with what many are calling the ultimate display of youthful, romantic energy. But it wasn’t just the cute outfits and dinner date that had fans talking—it was the way they moved, dressed, and interacted. According to body language expert Judi James, their coordinated style and subtle affection hint at something deeper than celebrity chemistry: the belief that they may have truly found “the one.”Taylor Swift looked radiant in a flirty pale pink mini dress with gold buttons, while Travis Kelce kept it sleek in cropped black trousers, white socks, loafers, and a crisp white shirt. While this might seem like standard celebrity datewear, Judi James sees it as far more intentional. “Taylor and Travis’s styling and their body language suggest something of a time-warp,” she noted, pointing to their classic prom-queen and king aesthetic.This wasn’t just a fashionable night out. Judi James observed that Kelce’s wardrobe choices are starting to mirror Swift’s romantic style. “Travis's short-cropped black pants and white socks suggest he's gradually and happily style-twinning with her,” she said.But it was his subtle movements that said even more. “Travis sucks his lips in at one point to show he's taking the date very seriously and his large paw of a hand encases Taylor's hand in a clasp of macho protection. ”From their body positioning— Kelce confidently leading while Swift walked demurely behind—to the way she held her small handbag close, everything about their presence suggested a couple relishing that new, enchanted stage of romance. “Taylor's body language epitomizes 'demure' here, with her head lowered, her elbows pulled into her waist and that dinky little bag held in one hand,” James added.Judi James believes this ""first-date college look"" may not be accidental. “It could be a desire to stoke the idyllic romantic side of their relationship or a mutual wish to present each other as 'The One', going back to a teen-date state to delete any high-profile and sometimes less than agreeable relationships they've each had with others in the past,” she explained.Also Read: Why Taylor Swift’s love life feels louder with Travis Kelce than it ever did with Joe Alwyn Taylor Swift has long built her brand on emotional storytelling, and this softer, sweeter public persona may be a reflection of a new, more intentional chapter.

A new portrait of Donald Trump, this time with his approval, now hangs in the Colorado Capitol after the last one drew his ire for not being to his liking.The new portrait, which Trump reportedly requested to be printed with a golden border to make it “glimmer” in the light, closely resembles his official second-term photo displayed in over 1,600 federal buildings and many more by choice across the US, according to the Guardian.""Thank you to the Highly Talented Artist, Vanessa Horabuena, and the incredible people of Colorado — Now on display in the Colorado State Capitol!"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.This comes as a great relief for the administration as, last time, Trump lashed out at artist Sarah Boardman for making a “purposely distorted” portrait of him.“Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves, but the one in Colorado, in the State Capitol, put up by the Governor, along with all other Presidents, was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before. I would much prefer not having a picture than having this one,” he had said.The Horabuena portrait, donated by the White House about a month ago, was installed this week following a decision by Lois Court, former state lawmaker and chair of the Capitol Building Advisory Committee, which oversees artwork selection for the Denver Capitol.""There was a blank on the wall. It seemed inappropriate. We knew that the White House had sent us this replacement and it simply made sense to put it up,” Court said.The portrait, along with those of other past presidents, may not stay up for long as the advisory committee is weighing a plan to replace them with portraits of former governors for Colorado’s 150th statehood anniversary next year.","The new portrait, which Trump reportedly requested to be printed with a golden border to make it “glimmer” in the light, closely resembles his official second- term photo displayed in over 1,600 federal buildings and many more by choice across the US.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122194207,imgsize-811594,width-400,resizemode-4/122194207.jpg"

BENGALURU: A group of friends' temple visit turned tragic Tuesday as the MUV in which they were travelling in toppled at least seven times in Doddaballapur, causing the death of five people and leaving three injured.Eight friends were heading to a temple in Gauribidanur taluk, Chikkaballapura district, in a rented Toyota Innova. Police said the accident happened around 10.45am between Nayakarandanahalli and Makali village of Doddaballapur on the state highway connecting to Gauribidanur.The victims are Eshwarappa, 75; DN Kalappa, 69; Purushottam, 62; Gopinath, 52; Narasmiha Murthy, 50, driver of the Innova. The injured are Kumara, 50; Srinivas, 55; Narayanappa, 60. Police said the friends were weavers, farmers and small-time businessmen. They would regularly go for morning and evening walks together.They decided to visit Shri Bheemeshwara Temple near Manchenahalli, Gauribidanur taluk, and hired the MUV.Murthy, who was driving the vehicle, overtook a truck on the curve of a narrow road and found a bus coming from the opposite direction. He tried to avoid the bus and pulled the steering to the left side, losing balance. As a result, the Innova rolled upside down at least seven times, according to police.

NAVI MUMBAI: A day after a newborn was found abandoned on a street outside an orphanage in Panvel, the biological parents were traced on Sunday. The police identified the child's father as a 23-year-old Bhiwandi resident, Aman Kondkar, an engineer who is currently unemployed. He told the police that he was in a relationship with a 20-year-old distant relative woman from Mumbra.The two-day-old girl had been placed in a plastic basket which was left on a pavement outside an orphanage in Takka Colony early Saturday morning.Even as family members of the couple were opposed to the marriage, the woman got pregnant and delivered the child at a private hospital in Mumbra. ""At the private hospital where the baby was born, the couple had claimed they were married...,"" said assistant commissioner of police (crime) Ajay Landge.The couple had arrived at the spot in a car. The vehicle registration number helped the police track them down. Footage from CCTV cameras in the locality helped the police zero in on the couple. ""One of the recordings showed a burkha-clad woman carrying the basket and placing it on the pavement outside Swapnalay Girls' Orphanage,"" said the officer.The infant was found in the basket, with a note that the person who had left the newborn felt ""sorry for abandoning"" the infant.The couple had left the newborn at the spot early Saturday.The infant is currently in the custody of a charitable organisation. The state child welfare committee will decide whether or not to hand over custody of the child to the parents.The mother has claimed that she ""repented her act and decided to bring back the baby the next day"", said senior inspector of Panvel police station, Nitin Thakare. The police said they are still to ascertain if the couple were married.The couple has been booked for abandoning a child. They have not been arrested, but served with a notice, directing them to participate in the investigation.A psychiatrist from Masina Hospital, Dr Priyanka Mahajan, said that if a baby is born out of wedlock, there can be immense societal and psychological pressure on a young mother to ""get rid"" of the child due to the stigma attached to it.Dr Mahajan pointed out that a mother does feel guilt and remorse due to the natural human bond between a mother and her baby.","Two-day-old girl had been placed in a plastic basket which was left on a pavement outside an orphanage in Takka Colony early Saturday morning.

'Hang Your Heads…’: Elon Musk’s STARTLING Warning To Pro-Trump Brigade Over ‘Big Beautiful Bill’

Elon Musk teases formation of the “America Party”



What’s in the “One Big, Beautiful Bill”



Elon Musk’s public criticism of Republican leadership

Tech billionaire Elon Musk has launched a pointed critique of President Donald Trump ’s sweeping legislative proposal known as the “One Big, Beautiful Bill.” The bill, which includes a record $5 trillion debt ceiling increase along with major federal spending adjustments, has passed the House and is currently under Senate review. Musk, who previously aligned with Trump on multiple issues, has now emerged as one of the proposal’s loudest critics.He warns that the legislation threatens long-term fiscal stability and undermines conservative promises to limit government spending. According to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the bill could add approximately $3.3 trillion to the national deficit over the next decade. Musk has voiced concern that both major parties are failing to serve the public interest, calling the bill emblematic of a political system that he believes is fundamentally broken. His response has gone beyond criticism, with a new political initiative now on the table.In a post on X, Elon Musk announced that if the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” passes in the Senate, he will immediately move forward with launching a new political party called the “America Party.” Musk argued that the United States currently functions as a one-party system dominated by financial self-interest. His post read, “If this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day. Our country needs an alternative to the Democrat-Republican uniparty so that the people actually have a VOICE.”This proposed party would represent a formal departure from Musk’s earlier alignment with the Republican establishment. The idea of forming a new party comes after Musk sharply criticised the bill’s size and content, particularly its massive increase to the debt ceiling. He suggested that the political elite had abandoned fiscal conservatism and no longer represented the interests of ordinary Americans.The legislation includes provisions for increased spending in areas such as defence, border security, and energy, while also proposing significant cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. It raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, the largest in U.S. history. While the House narrowly passed the measure, it must now undergo rigorous debate and potential amendments in the Senate. Should the Senate version differ, the bill will return to the House for a final vote before reaching Trump for signing.According to the Congressional Budget Office, the legislation is projected to add roughly $3.3 trillion to the federal deficit over ten years. Fiscal conservatives have raised concerns over the long-term economic implications, arguing that the bill deviates from campaign promises to rein in government spending.Musk’s objections extended beyond the bill itself. He directed his frustration toward the House Freedom Caucus and specific Republican lawmakers, including Representative Andy Harris, the current chair. “How can you call yourself the Freedom Caucus if you vote for a DEBT SLAVERY bill with the biggest debt ceiling increase in history?” Musk posted. He warned that lawmakers who supported the measure risk political consequences. “Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame! And they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.”",Elon Musk says to form ‘America Party’ if Donald Trump’s ‘insane’ Big Beautiful Bill passes.

Chinese parts in US defense



'US not prepared for war with China'







Despite years of warnings and efforts to decouple, the United States defense industrial base remains alarmingly reliant on China, the very nation it might one day have to confront in battle. A new report from data analytics firm Govini paints a sobering picture of America’s war readiness, raising the question: could the US actually sustain a conflict with China, or is it too entangled in its rival’s supply chains?The report reveals that Chinese firms supply nearly one in ten critical components for major US defense programs, including missile defense, nuclear systems, and space technology. It highlights how deeply Beijing’s industries are woven into America’s military supply chains, with particular reliance on Chinese-made parts in missile defense, and on critical minerals dominated by China’s production.According to Govini’s National Security Scorecard, released this week, Chinese firms made up 9.3% of primary contractors, known as Tier 1 suppliers, for major US defense programs across nine critical sectors in 2024. These sectors include aviation, maritime, command and control systems, nuclear, missile defense, and space.The report further noted how deeply Chinese suppliers were embedded in vital military supply chains.The missile defense sector, key to protecting the US from attack, had the highest reliance: 11.1% of Tier 1 suppliers were Chinese.Even the nuclear sector, where security stakes are at their highest, counted on Chinese suppliers for 7.8% of its components, more than any other foreign country.“The United States is not prepared for the war that we may have to enter if China said, ‘today is the day’,” South China Morning Post quoted Tara Dougherty, Govini’s CEO saying.While the dependence is clear, fully eliminating Chinese suppliers is not so simple. Dougherty cautioned against viewing decoupling as a silver bullet.“I’m not even sure that eradicating China from the supply chain is the right goal,” she said, adding, “I think it’s about dissecting these platforms into what’s critical and what’s not.”One area of particular concern was critical minerals, as per the report. It noted that hundreds of weapon systems, from jets to ships to missiles, depended on minerals like antimony, gallium, germanium, tungsten and tellurium.China dominates global production of these materials. In fact, Govini found that 78% of US weapon systems could be affected by Chinese export curbs on these minerals. This vulnerability was highlighted by Beijing’s recent restrictions on rare earth exports as part of its broader tech and trade tensions with Washington.","Chinese firms supply nearly one in ten critical components for major US defense programs.

North Korea opens massive beach resort: state media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-opens-massive-beach-resort-state-media/articleshow/122195945.cms,"Representative image





SEOUL: North Korea opened a massive resort area on its east coast, state media said Wednesday, with the tourism pet project of leader Kim Jong Un reportedly set to welcome Russian guests this month.Dubbed ""North Korea's Waikiki"" by South Korean media, the Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist area can accommodate nearly 20,000 people, according to Pyongyang, which previously described it as ""a world-class cultural resort"".Kim showed a keen interest in developing North Korea's tourism industry during his early years in power, analysts have said, and the coastal resort area was a particular focus.The tourist zone opened to domestic visitors Tuesday, Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency reported, publishing images of tourists in colourful swimsuits enjoying the beach.North Koreans of all ages from across the country flocked to the site this week ""filled with joy at experiencing a new level of civilization"", KCNA reported.The visitors were ""astonished by the grandeur and splendor of the tourist city, where more than 400... artistically designed buildings lined the white sandy beach in ideal harmony"", it added.According to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, a group of Russian tourists is set to visit the zone in North Korea for the first time on July 7.South Korea's unification ministry, which manages relations with the North, said the site's operations are ""expected to gradually expand"", including to Russian tourists.Kim said last week the construction of the site would go down as ""one of the greatest successes this year"" and that the North would build more large-scale tourist zones ""in the shortest time possible"".Previously released images showed him sitting in a chair, alongside his teenage daughter Ju Ae and wife Ri Sol Ju, watching a man flying off a water slide in the resort.But given the limited capacity of available flights, international tourism to the new beach resort is ""likely to remain small in scale,"" according to Seoul's unification ministry.""It is estimated that tourists will travel via Pyongyang, and that the number of visitors may be limited to around 170 people per day,"" the ministry said.North Korea sees tourism as a key source of foreign currency, it said, and Pyongyang may have received aid to complete the site from Russia in exchange for joining its war in Ukraine.The nuclear-armed North reopened its borders in August 2023 after almost four years, having closed them because of the Covid-19 pandemic, during which even its own nationals were prevented from entering.But foreign tourism was limited even before the pandemic, with tour companies saying around 5,000 Western tourists visited each year. Significantly more Chinese tourists were allowed at the time.The North last year permitted Russian tourists to return for the first time since the pandemic and Western tour operators returned in February this year. No Chinese tourists are known to have returned to the country.","The Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist area can accommodate nearly 20,000 people.

Dubai Misdemeanours Court has sentenced five Asian men to one month in jail, followed by deportation, for impersonating police officers and defrauding an Arab national of Dh9,900 ($2,700). The court also issued a combined fine of Dh9,900 ($2,700) against the group for their involvement in the scam.The incident occurred in March, when the victim received a phone call from one of the scammers claiming to be a Dubai police officer. The caller falsely informed him that his bank account would be frozen unless he immediately updated his information.Panicked by the warning, the man provided his bank details. Shortly afterward, he realised that Dh9,900 ($2,700) had been withdrawn without his consent.Dubai Police traced the call to an apartment in Deira, where the suspects had been operating. During the raid, officers seized multiple smartphones, some of which were hidden in shoes and plastic bags to evade detection. Forensic analysis confirmed that one of the confiscated phones had been used to contact the complainant.During questioning, the defendants admitted to acting under the orders of a man who had rented the apartment and later left the country. He gave them instructions remotely, used stolen bank information to withdraw funds, and paid each of them a monthly salary between Dh1,800 and Dh2,000 ($490–$545).The court found all five men guilty of:In addition to serving a month-long jail sentence, the convicts will be deported after completing their term.Dubai Police issued a strong reminder to the public to stay alert against such scams.“Dubai Police do not request banking information over the phone under any circumstances. Any such call should be considered suspicious,” a police spokesperson said to a local media outlet.“If you receive such a call, do not engage. End the conversation and report it immediately through the Dubai Police app or by calling 901,” the spokesperson added.","Dubai Misdemeanours Court has sentenced five Asian men to one month in jail, followed by deportation.

Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska made a critical call on Tuesday, casting a vote for President Donald Trump’s massive tax-and-spending bill.For much of the all‑night session, Senate Minority Whip John Thune was uncertain whether he could secure Murkowski’s support. The Alaska senator spent hours in public and private discussions, pressing colleagues to soften provisions she said would burden her state’s most vulnerable residents.Murkowski at the end provided the 50th Republican “yea”, paving the way for Vice‑President JD Vance to break the tie and pass the measure 51‑50.Three Republicans—Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky—joined all Democrats in opposing the bill.“I advocated for my state’s interests, and I will make no excuses for doing that,” Murkowski told reporters just after the vote. “Do I like this bill? No. But I tried to take care of Alaska’s interests.”Her support was unsure after the Senate parliamentarian struck down two attempts to boost Medicaid payments for Alaska and Hawaii, ruling they violated reconciliation rules. A further bid to increase Alaska’s Medicaid funding was also rejected early Tuesday, dealing another blow to Thune’s efforts.“I held my head up and made sure that the people of Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ could cost thousands of lives, say University researchersAlaska are not forgotten in this,” Murkowski said. “I think there is more that needs to be done, and I’m not done.

NAGPUR: Saying “I love you” does not amount to sexual harassment unless accompanied by conduct suggesting sexual intent, Bombay high court’s Nagpur bench ruled Monday while overturning a 2017 conviction under the Pocso Act Justice Urmila JoshiPhalke acquitted a 25-yearold man from Katol in Nagpur district, nearly eight years after he was sentenced to three years’ rigorous imprisonment for harassing a 17year-old girl. He appealed the session court verdict in HC and was out on bail.“If somebody says that he is in love with another person or expresses his feelings that in itself would not amount to an intent showing some sort of sexual intention” the judge said in her order. “Words expressed as ‘I love you’ would not by themselves amount to ‘sexual intent’ as contemplated by the legislature,” she added.The case dated back to Oct 2015, when a class 11 student accused the man of stopping her and her cousin , grabbing her hand and saying: “I love you”. Based on her complaint, police charged him under sections 354A (sexual harassment) and 354D (stalking) of IPC, along with Section 8 of Pocso Act.Two years later, the sessions court convicted him. His counsel Sonali Khobragade said his actions did not meet the legal threshold for sexual assault or stalking as there was no repeated contact or physical act indicating sexual intent.Justice Joshi-Phalke agreed. “There should be something more that must suggest the real intention is to introduce the angle of sex…,” she said. “The offence under Pocso Act is not made out as there is no allegation that the accused touched the girl with sexual intent.”"," Bombay high court’s Nagpur bench ruled Monday while overturning a 2017 conviction under the Pocso Act. “Words expressed as ‘I love you’ would not by themselves amount to ‘sexual intent’ as contemplated by the legislature,” she added.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122195113,imgsize-87616,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/122195113.jpg"

CAIRO: Four people died and 22 others were injured after a barge in the Gulf of Suez sank, the Egyptian government said Wednesday.The barge Adam Marine 12 sank on Tuesday night, the health ministry said, without providing details of the cause of the capsizing.The four people who died were brought to Egypt's Hurghada hospital on the Red Sea coast, the ministry said on social media.Four injured people were airlifted and 18 others were transported by ambulance to another local hospital, it added.Egypt's petroleum ministry said on Facebook it had received a report from Offshore Shukheir oil Company (Osoco) that the barge capsized in the Gebel El-Zeit area in the Gulf of Suez.The area is around 300 kilometres (190 miles) south of the Suez Canal, a key waterway linking Europe and Asia.The canal accounted for about 10 percent of global maritime trade before Yemen's Huthis began attacking vessels transiting the Red Sea in late 2023.The Huthi rebels say their attacks are committed in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, where Israel and militant group Hamas have been at war since October 2023","Four people died and 22 others were injured after a barge in the Gulf of Suez sank.

The US on Tuesday announced that it would suspend certain crucial arms deliveries to Ukraine, previously pledged under President Biden's administration, potentially impacting Kyiv's defence against Russian aggression.""This decision was made to put America's interests first following a DOD (department of defense) review of our nation's military support and assistance to other countries across the globe,"" White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement, AFP reported.The Biden administration's previous commitments of munitions to Ukraine have been paused under President Donald Trump's leadership, following defence department assessments of US stockpiles and shifting priorities.This follows Trump's recent directive for US missile strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.A US official, speaking anonymously, revealed that Pentagon reviews found insufficient stocks of certain promised weapons, leading to the cancellation of some planned deliveries. The specific weapons affected remain undisclosed.Spokesman Sean Parnell emphasised US military readiness, noting that pending legislation would enhance defence capabilities against contemporary threats.This suspension of US weapons support impacts Ukraine during intensified Russian aerial attacks, complicating Trump-backed peace initiatives.

Recall of probe report 'abnormal'







The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) blocked probe into the allegations of Chinese Communist Party meddling into the 2020 US presidential elections to benefit Joe Biden , aiming to shield then-FBI Director Christopher Wray as it would ""contradict"" his congressional testimony, Fox News Digital reported citing newly declassified FBI documents.The documents, containing exchanges between FBI officials prior to the 2020 election, were recently declassified by FBI director Kash Patel and sent to senate judiciary committee chair Chuck Grassley of Iowa.According to the report, Chinese government created “a large amount” of fake US driver’s licenses, generated using data from millions of TikTok users, “tens of thousands of Chinese students and immigrants sympathetic to the Chinese Communist Party to vote for US Presidential Candidate Joe Biden, despite not being eligible to vote in the United States,” the New York Post reported.Moreover, the FBI’s Albany field office reported the plot from a credible source, but FBI headquarters ""suppressed"" the report, partly because it would ""contradict"" director Wray’s congressional testimony claiming no coordinated national voter fraud.Internal communications showed Albany staff protested the suppression, warning that political motives were influencing intelligence handling and that the suppression prevented other agencies from vetting the information.Details of the alleged meddling were shared in an FBI Intelligence Information Report (IIR) on September 25, 2020, just a day after Wray told Congress the bureau had no knowledge of any “coordinated national voter fraud effort”. The report, however, was withdrawn within minutes of being released.Calling the move ""abnormal"", FBI assistant director Marshall Yates, in a letter to Chuck Grassley earlier this year said, “Based on conversations with key individuals involved, it was conveyed that the recall of the IIR was abnormal.”Yates had said that the probe report had ""prompted significant attention throughout FBI Headquarters"" and ""the recall was issued to 'reinterview' the source.""""The rationale provided to Albany staff for the recall was that Headquarters deemed the report not 'authoritative,' but this characterization was met with disagreement by those in the Albany office. Internal emails reflect that Albany staff had concerns that suppressing the IIR would be 'dangerous if we cite potential political implications as reasons for not putting out our information,' emphasizing that it was not the role of analysts to align intelligence with public testimony,"" he wrote in the letter.","Recall of probe report 'abnormal' says FBI assistant director Marshall Yates.

20-year-old Wess Roley who lured firefighters after starting a brush fire intentionally in Idaho and then killed two firefighters when they responded to the fire, had a disturbing childhood, CNN reported, citing court documents. As soon as the shooter was identified as Wess Roley, social media was abuzz with a purported photo of his parents (mother and stepfather) sporting MAGA hats. While the veracity of most of the social media claims are not known, Wess Roley's grandfather spoke to CNN and said he was not a loner and had no reason to be involved in something like this.Wess Roley who was found dead at the fire scene himself wanted to be a firefighter, his grandfather said. “He wanted to be a fireman – he was doing tree work and he wanted to be a fireman in the forest,” Dale Roley said. “As far as I know, he was actually pursuing it.”Dale Roley said he typically spoke with his grandson on a weekly basis, but they hadn’t spoken in the last month because Wess Roley had lost his phone. He said the suspect had loving family and friends, and he vacationed in Hawaii with his mother last year, according to social media posts.He said he was holding out hope that his grandson was not the actual shooter.CNN cited court documents claiming that Roley's mother filed for divorce in 2015 when Roley was 10 years old. In court documents, she wrote that Roley's father threatened her, pushed her to the ground and ""pinched several holes in the walls"".“He threatened to sit outside my house with a sniper rifle or burn my house down,” she wrote.The divorce was granted in two months and Roley's mother became the primary residential parent.

Middle East conflict: Donald Trump announces Israel's agreement to 60-day ceasefire plan; urges Hamas to take deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/middle-east-conflict-donald-trump-announces-israels-agreement-to-60-day-ceasefire-plan-urges-hamas-to-take-deal/articleshow/122192167.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Tuesday claimed that Israel had agreed to the key terms of a proposed 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, raising hopes for a temporary halt to the ongoing conflict that has killed over 58,000 Palestinians since October 2023.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, “My Representatives had a long and productive meeting with the Israelis today on Gaza. Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions to finalize the 60 Day CEASEFIRE, during which time we will work with all parties to end the War. The Qataris and Egyptians, who have worked very hard to help bring Peace, will deliver this final proposal. I hope, for the good of the Middle East, that Hamas takes this Deal, because it will not get better — IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”Also read: Iran-Israel conflict: Iran's top clerics issue 'fatwa' against Donald Trump, Benjamin Netanyahu; calls them 'warlords' Trump’s statement comes amid rising international pressure to stop the violence, which began after the October 7, 2023, attacks when Hamas gunmen stormed southern Israel, killing over 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. Israel responded with a large-scale military offensive that has devastated much of the Gaza Strip.Trump did not clarify the exact terms of the proposed truce.However, he suggested that the ceasefire would provide a window to negotiate a broader end to the war, with Qatar and Egypt playing a key role in delivering the final offer to Hamas.Also read: Ceasefire next week?

The US also joined the assault by dropping bombs on Iran's top nuclear sites, which was condemned by Supreme Leader Khamenei.","US President Donald Trump claims that Israel has agreed to the key terms of a proposed 60-day ceasefire in Gaza.

'Arrest': Trump's fresh threat to Mamdani if he interferes with ICE deportation as 'NYC mayor',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/arrest-trumps-fresh-threat-to-mamdani-if-he-interferes-with-ice-deportation-if-he-becomes-nyc-mayor/articleshow/122189832.cms,"Donald Trump threatens that if Mamdani becomes NYC mayor and stops ICE from doing its work, he will be arrested.





Donald Trump said as the president he will have to arrest Zohran Mamdani if he becomes the New York mayor and then blocks ICE from doing its work. Mamdani has won the democratic primary and to become the New York mayor, he will have to win the general election in November. But Trump has already threatened that he will cut federal funds to NYC, arrest Mamdani -- if the socialist does not cooperate with the Trump administration, if and when he becomes the NYC mayor.Trump was asked about Zohran Mamdani's election promise that he would defy ICE and would not allow ICE to arrest criminal aliens in New York City. ""Well then we'll have just to arrest him. Look, we don't need a communist in this country but if we have one, I'm going to be watching over him very carefully on behalf of the nation. We send him money, we send him all the things that he needs to run a government and by the way, they get already about three times what you get. If you look at per capita, Florida gets one-third of what New York gets,"" Trump said as he hosted an immigration roundtable at New Florida Detention Facility.""A lot of people are saying he (Mamdani) is here illegally. You know we are going to look over everything. And ideally, he's going to turn out to be much less than a communist but right now he's a communist.That's not a socialist,"" Trump said.Mamdani earlier reacted to Donald Trump calling him a communist and said the president wants to distract from what he's fighting for. ""I've already had to start to get used to the fact that the president will talk about how I look, how I sound, where I'm from, who I am,"" Mamdani said on Mee the Press on June 29.""He wants to distract from what I'm fighting for,"" Mamdani said. ""I'm fighting for the very working people he ran a campaign to empower that he has since then betrayed.""Trump earlier said Mamdani would be ""very unsuccessful"" if he tries to keep New York a sanctuary city. ""If he does get in, I'm going to be president and he's going to have to do the right thing or they're not getting any money. He's got to do the right thing,"" Trump said. Trump said he would not publicly back a candidate in the race, which along with Mamdani, Cuomo and Adams includes a third independent candidate and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa.""Whoever is the mayor of New York is going to have to behave themselves or the federal government is coming down very tough on them financially,"" Trump said.","Donald Trump threatens to arrest Zohran Mamdani if he becomes NYC mayor and then blocks ICE from doing its work.

‘Go Back To Third World’: Zohran Mamdani MOCKED For Eating With Hands By Trump Aide

What is the row over eating rice with hands?







Without naming NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, Harmeet K Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights at the US Department of Justice, waded into the rice controversy as she shared a photo of rice and lentils in two different pots with spoons in both of them. ""Mom sent me home from the weekend with daal and rice...which I'm hearing and eating with a spoon -- not like some like some performance artist LARPing philistine!"" Dhillon, who was born in India (Punjab) wrote.A major controversy broke out as a video of Zohran Mamdani eating rice with his hand went viral. The anti-Mamdani sentiments soon turned into anti-India as eating with hands is an accepted form of eating in India.GOP leader, Congressman Brandon Gill called Mamdani uncivilized as he pointed out that civilized people in America don't eat with their hands. ""If you refuse to adopt Western customs, go back to the Third World,"" Gill wrote. The Congressman was reminded that his wife is of Indian-origin and she definitely eats with her hand.Brandon Gill's wife Danielle D'Souza Gill joined the debate and said she did not grow up eating rice with her hands and always used a fork.""I did not grow up eating rice with my hands and have always used a fork. I was born in America. I’m a Christian MAGA patriot. My father’s extended family lives in India and they are also Christian and they use forks too,"" Danielle wrote.Danielle's father Dinesh D'Souza, a Conservative commentator who was born in India, said eating with hands is gross in America, but not in India. Reating to a now viral photo of him eating with his hand, D'Souza wrote: ""My culture lesson for Mamdani: Eating with your hands is acceptable when it’s bread, naan or pizza. Not when it’s soup, meatloaf or mashed potatoes. Indians sometimes eat rice with their hands in India, but it’s much more common in rural areas. In America, it’s considered gross.""Mamdani's video grossed many Americans out but a section of social media users debated that it was not eating with hand that disgusted them but Mamdani choosing to do so for a video while he definitely does not use his hands always for eating came across as performative modesty that Mamdani was aiming at.","Harmeet K Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights at the US Department of Justice, shared a photo of rice and lentils in two different pots with spoons in both of them.

Major reports about how climate change affects the US are removed from websites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/major-reports-about-how-climate-change-affects-the-us-are-removed-from-websites/articleshow/122189311.cms,"



WASHINGTON: Legally mandated US national climate assessments seem to have disappeared from the federal websites built to display them, making it harder for state and local governments and the public to learn what to expect in their backyards from a warming world.Scientists said the peer-reviewed authoritative reports save money and lives. Websites for the national assessments and the US Global Change Research Program were down Monday and Tuesday with no links, notes or referrals elsewhere. The White House, which was responsible for the assessments, said the information will be housed within NASA to comply with the law, but gave no further details.Searches for the assessments on NASA websites did not turn them up. NASA did not respond to requests for information. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which coordinated the information in the assessments, did not respond to repeated inquiries.""It's critical for decision makers across the country to know what the science in the National Climate Assessment is. That is the most reliable and well-reviewed source of information about climate that exists for the United States,"" said University of Arizona climate scientist Kathy Jacobs, who coordinated the 2014 version of the report.""It's a sad day for the United States if it is true that the National Climate Assessment is no longer available,"" Jacobs said. ""This is evidence of serious tampering with the facts and with people's access to information, and it actually may increase the risk of people being harmed by climate-related impacts.""Harvard climate scientist John Holdren, who was President Obama's science advisor and whose office directed the assessments, said after the 2014 edition he visited governors, mayors and other local officials who told him how useful the 841-page report was. It helped them decide whether to raise roads, build seawalls and even move hospital generators from basements to roofs, he said.""This is a government resource paid for by the taxpayer to provide the information that really is the primary source of information for any city, state or federal agency who's trying to prepare for the impacts of a changing climate,"" said Texas Tech climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, who has been a volunteer author for several editions of the report.Copies of past reports are still squirreled away in NOAA's library. NASA's open science data repository includes dead links to the assessment site.The most recent report, issued in 2023, included an interactive atlas that zoomed down to the county level. It found that climate change is affecting people's security, health and livelihoods in every corner of the country in different ways, with minority and Native American communities often disproportionately at risk.The 1990 Global Change Research Act requires a national climate assessment every four years and directs the president to establish an interagency United States Global Change Research Program. In the spring, the Trump administration told the volunteer authors of the next climate assessment that their services weren't needed and ended the contract with the private firm that helps coordinate the website and report.Additionally, NOAA's main climate.gov website was recently forwarded to a different NOAA website. Social media and blogs at NOAA and NASA about climate impacts for the general public were cut or eliminated.""It's part of a horrifying big picture,"" Holdren said. ""It's just an appalling whole demolition of science infrastructure.""The national assessments are more useful than international climate reports put out by the United Nations every seven or so years because they are more localized and more detailed, Hayhoe and Jacobs said.The national reports are not only peer reviewed by other scientists, but examined for accuracy by the National Academy of Sciences, federal agencies, the staff and the public.Hiding the reports would be censoring science, Jacobs said.And it's dangerous for the country, Hayhoe said, comparing it to steering a car on a curving road by only looking through the rearview mirror: ""And now, more than ever, we need to be looking ahead to do everything it takes to make it around that curve safely. It's like our windshield's being painted over.""","Scientists say the peer-reviewed authoritative reports save money and lives.

"Zohran Mamdani defeats Andrew Cuomo in NYC Democratic Mayoral Primary, advances to general election; could become first Muslim, Indian-American to hold post",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/zohran-mamdani-defeats-andrew-cuomo-in-nyc-democratic-mayoral-primary-advances-to-general-election-could-become-first-muslim-indian-american-to-hold-post/articleshow/122188514.cms,"



NEW YORK: Zohran Mamdani has officially secured victory in New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary, with a final vote count on Tuesday confirming his upset win over former Governor Andrew Cuomo. He now advances to the general election.Since Mamdani took a decisive lead following the polls closing a week ago and narrowly missed the 50 per cent of the vote required to prevent a second count under the city's ranked choice voting system, his victory had been anticipated, news agency Associated Press reported.If a voter's favorite candidate withdraws from the race, the method permits their alternative preferences to be taken into consideration.In the general election, Mamdani, who announced his victory on the evening of the June 24 primary, will compete against incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, Republican Curtis Sliwa, and independent Jim Walden.On the evening of the primary on June 24, Cuomo admitted defeat, but he is still debating whether to run on an independent ticket in the general election.Mamdani, a democratic socialist who is 33 years old and a member of the state Assembly, was almost unknown when he ran for office with a daring list of populist policies.However, as the elder, more moderate Democrat attempted to recover from the sexual harassment crisis that forced his departure four years ago, he created a dynamic campaign that ran circles around Cuomo.The political world was rocked by the results even before they were confirmed.Mamdani's campaign, which aimed to reduce living expenses, says it has discovered a new path for Democrats who have occasionally seemed lost during President Donald Trump's ascent to power.The Democratic establishment has been cautious in its attitude to Mamdani.Although many of its major players praised his campaign, they don't appear prepared to fully support the young progressive. For some in the party, his previous criticisms of law enforcement, use of the word ""genocide"" to describe the actions of the Israeli government in Gaza, and designation as a ""democratic socialist"" are like landmines.Mamdani would be the first mayor of Indian American descent and the first Muslim in the city if elected. He would be among its youngest as well.Mamdani has already given Republicans a fresh line of attack. Ahead of important elections later this year and next, Trump and other GOP figures have started to take aim at Mamdani, portraying him as the pinnacle of socialist excess.According to Syracuse University political science professor Grant Reeher, ""I want this guy to win if I'm a Republican."" ""Because I want to be able to compare and contrast my campaign as a Republican with the notion that the Democratic party is in this position in a national election.""The ranked choice voting system in New York City enables voters to rank up to five candidates on their ballots. A candidate is declared the winner of the race if more than 50% of voters select them as their first choice.On the night of the primary, no candidate was able to clear that hurdle; therefore, the ranked-choice voting method took over. On July 15, the board is expected to certify the election.Since joining the state Assembly in 2021, Mamdani has described his lack of experience as a possible strength.In exchange for taxes on the wealthy, his campaign promised free city buses, free child care, government-run grocery shops, a rent freeze for rent-stabilized apartments, and more.His plan has been criticized for being politically unfeasible.Cuomo launched a campaign that focused on his wealth of experience, positioning himself as the one contender who could turn around a city that had gotten out of hand.He prioritized fighting antisemitism during the campaign and relied more on his well-known brand and successful fundraising effort than on engaging with voters.He denied any misconduct when confronted with the sexual harassment accusations that brought an end to his term as governor, arguing that the issue was motivated by politics and that voters were prepared to move on.Ahead of a procedural deadline to do so, Cuomo did not take his name off the November ballot last week. He has stated that he is still unsure about whether to run for government.Adams is an independent candidate in the November election, despite still being a Democrat. After being seriously hurt by his now-dismissed federal bribery case, he withdrew from the Democratic primary in April.In the days following Mamdani's declaration of victory, he rekindled his reelection campaign, despite having done little before. He referred to it as a contest between a candidate with a ""blue collar"" and one with a ""silver spoon.""","Zohran Mamdani defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary.

"Flash floods sweep Pakistan’s Swat Valley, kill 32",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/flash-floods-sweep-pakistans-swat-valley-kill-32/articleshow/122146687.cms,"



MINGORA, SWAT: Torrential rain triggered flash floods that tore through Pakistan’s northwestern Swat Valley over the weekend, killing at least 32 people and laying bare gaps in disaster preparedness in a region once ravaged by Taliban.Twelve members of one family were swept away while picnicking along the river in Swat, witnesses said. Phone videos showed relatives clinging to rocks, screaming for help as waters surged around them. “We kept dialling the emergency numbers, but no one came. By the time they did, it was too late… we were pulling out bodies,” local vendor Kabeer said.The family had travelled from Mardan and remained trapped for over an hour with no rescue teams arriving. “This valley has lived through terrorists, military operations, and devastating floods. Every time, we’re promised lessons will be learned, but nothing ever really changes,” said Khan Sher, a resident of Mingora, recalling Taliban control before the 2009 army offensive and the devastation of the 2010 floods.Heavy rain pounded Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Balochistan, causing widespread destruction. “Flash floods caught us off-guard in Swat.We’ve retrieved 16 bodies so far from the river. Rescue operations are ongoing,” a rescue official said.Swat, now a bustling tourist hub, largely escaped the catastrophic 2022 floods that killed over 1,700 nationwide. This time, towns like Bahrain and Kalam, packed with riverside hotels, had little buffer when waters surged. Entire stretches transformed into danger zones within minutes.Pakistan has championed climate justice on global stages, yet its domestic disaster response remains stretched thin. “Each year we mourn our dead, patch up the roads, and brace for the next disaster,” said Liaquat Bacha, a farmer whose fields were washed away.","Torrential rain triggered flash floods that tore through Pakistan’s northwestern Swat Valley over the weekend.
