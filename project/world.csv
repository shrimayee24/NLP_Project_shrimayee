2 arrested for pouring water at Taj Mahal, Hindu outfit says 'Gangajal' offered to 'Tejo Mahalay'

Agra Police arrested two youths for pouring water at the Taj Mahal, claiming it to be a Hindu temple. The suspects entered as tourists and were reported by the CISF. A local group, ABHM, later claimed that the two were their members who offered holy 'Gangajal' inside the premises. A detailed investigation is underway.

AGRA: The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) on Tuesday banned visitors and guides from carrying water bottles into the Taj Mahal ’s main mausoleum after repeated incidents of ‘ jalabhishek ’ (religious water ritual) by members of various right-wing groups . Carrying water bottles has been prohibited from the Taj’s Chameli Farsh to the main dome area.Two members of the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha were arrested on Saturday for offering Ganga water at the mausoleum, claiming the monument was a Shiva temple before being converted to a mausoleum by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan.Additionally, on the third Monday of Sawan, Meera Rathore, the district president of the Mahasabha’s women’s wing, performed ‘jalabhishek’ and hoisted a saffron flag at the Unesco World Heritage Site. The move to ban water inside the Taj has come in for criticism from some quarters.Deepak Dan, president of the Tourist Guides Welfare Association, said: “Tourists cannot remain in the Taj Mahal without water during hot and humid weather. Instead of being vigilant, authorities are imposing restrictions on water bottles. The association opposes this move.” He added, “Multiple cases of tourists passing out due to adverse weather conditions have surfaced in the last three months. Without water, visitors, especially children and the elderly, will suffer. The decision will also present a bad image among foreign tourists.”ASI superintending archaeologist Rajkumar Patel assured that visitors would not face inconvenience. He said, “Staff stationed at the main mausoleum have been provided with small water bottles.”","Two members of a right-wing group were arrested for pouring Ganga water at the Taj Mahal, believing it to be a Shiva temple.

"Gujarat judge, investigating officer draw SC ire, held in contempt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarat-judge-investigating-officer-draw-sc-ire-held-in-contempt/articleshow/112356229.cms,"NEW DELHI: Acting tough against an additional chief judicial magistrate and investigating officer of Gujarat Police for not honouring its order and taking a person in custody despite its order granting him anticipatory bail, Supreme Court Wednesday convicted both for contempt of court and directed them to personally appear before it for deciding punishment.A bench of Justices B R Gavai and Sandeep Mehta refused to accept their defence that they did not intend to violate the order, that it was done due to a misunderstanding of the order, and because of a prevalent practice in Gujarat permitting custody even after bail is granted. SC patiently heard the duo but came to the conclusion that the action of the investigating officer seeking custody of the accused, and of the judicial magistrate granting custody, are clearly in the teeth of its order and held them guilty of contempt of court.Though SC had issued notice to brass of Surat Police , including the commissioner along with the judicial magistrate and additional chief secretary of Gujarat’s home department for contempt, it convicted only the investigating officer who filed an application seeking custody and the magistrate who allowed the plea, and let off the rest saying they were not involved.“The portrayal made by the investigating officer in the remand application to claim the accused-petitioner was not cooperating in the investigation was totally cooked up and a clear attempt to draw wool over the court’s eyes... We are, therefore, inclined to hold that there was not even a shred of bona fide in the actions of the investigating officer while seeking police custody remand of the accused on the purported ground of non-cooperation in investigation,” the bench said.Slamming the ACJM , SC said a magistrate must not allow a plea of police without application of mind. “The courts are not expected to act as messengers of investigating agencies and remand applications should not be allowed in a routine manner.”SC, during the hearing, had said it was high time the people holding posts learn a lesson and had made it clear that they would be sent behind bars if needed.

In response, Israel's air force struck two Hezbollah facilities in southern Lebanon.

Asif Merchant: Who is Asif Merchant? Pakistani man with ties to Iran charged in assassination plots in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-asif-merchant-pakistani-man-with-ties-to-iran-charged-in-assassination-plots-in-us/articleshow/112328009.cms,"Who is Asif Merchant?

Asif Raza Merchant was charged in a complaint unsealed in federal court in Brooklyn with murder-for-hire as part of a scheme to assassinate a politician or US government officials on its soil. Law enforcement said they foiled the charged plot before any attack could be carried out. Merchant, who has stated that he has a wife and children in Iran and a wife and children in Pakistan, is in federal custody in New York. US Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York said that working on behalf of others overseas, Merchant planned the murder of US government officials on American soil. According to court documents, Merchant orchestrated a plot to assassinate a politician or US government officials on US soil. FBI director Christopher Wray said the ""dangerous murder-for-hire"" plot allegedly was orchestrated by a Pakistani national with close ties to Iran and is straight out of the Iranian playbook. In April 2024, after spending time in Iran, Merchant arrived in the United States from Pakistan and contacted a person he believed could assist him with the scheme. That person reported Merchant's conduct to law enforcement and became a confidential source. In early June, Merchant met the confidential source in New York and explained his assassination plot. Merchant told the individual the opportunity he had for the person was not a one-time opportunity and would be ongoing. Merchant then made a ""finger gun"" motion with his hand, indicating that the opportunity was related to a killing. Merchant stated that the intended victims would be ""targeted here"", meaning in the United States. Merchant instructed the individual to arrange meetings with others whom he could hire to carry out these actions. Merchant explained that his plot involved multiple criminal schemes including stealing documents or USB drives from a target's home; planning a protest; and killing a politician or government official. Merchant at the meeting began planning potential assassination scenarios and quizzed the individual on how he would kill a target in the various scenarios.

The plot by Asif Merchant

A 46-year-old Pakistani man, Asif Merchant , has been charged by the US Department of Justice for plotting to kill politicians, government officials on the US soil. Prosecutors in Brooklyn announced criminal charges against Asif Merchant, accusing him of travelling to New York for the purposes of trying to hire a hitman for the assassinations. The plot was disrupted before it could be carried out.The document did not name any potential target but CNN reported that former president Donald Trump and other current and former US government officials might be the targets of the plot.Trump was shot at by Thomas Crooks at a Pennsylvania rally last month in which the shooter was killed. This attempt was unrelated to the life threat that Trump had from Iran. US officials have warned for years about Iran's desire to avenge the 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force. That strike was ordered by Trump.Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement: ""The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would seek to carry out Iran's lethal plotting against American citizens and will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to target American public officials and endanger America's national security.""Merchant said, as revealed by the document, that the assassination would occur after he left the United States and he would communicate with the individual from overseas using code words. The source asked whether Merchant had spoken to the unidentified ""party"" back home with whom Merchant was working. Merchant responded that he had and the party back home told him to ""finalize"" the plan and leave the United States.In mid-June, Merchant met with the purported hitmen, who were undercover US law enforcement officers in New York. Merchant advised the undercover officers that he was looking for three services from them: theft of documents, arranging protests at political rallies, and for them to kill a ""political person"".Merchant said the hitmen would receive instructions on who to kill either the last week of August or the first week of September after he had departed the United States.On June 21, Merchant met with the undercover officers in New York and paid them the USD 5,000 advance. Merchant subsequently made flight arrangements and planned to leave the United States on July 12 when law enforcement agents placed him under arrest before he could leave the country.(With agency inputs)","A 46-year-old Pakistani man, Asif Merchant, has been charged by the US Department of Justice for plotting to kill politicians, government officials on the US soil.

‘She’s in shock, we will wait till she settles’

India seeks normalcy for its missions after law restored

NEW DELHI/LONDON: After reports that deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina was headed West, or London in all likelihood, it emerged Tuesday that she might have to stay put in India for days, if not longer. With India tight-lipped about how long it can allow her to stay here and the UK effectively ruling out asylum for her, Hasina was said to be exploring other options, including the US and Finland .While London is Hasina’s first choice for asylum, she hasn’t officially approached authorities yet, as confirmed by her son Sajeeb Wazed. Wazed was quoted as saying the US and the UK, where she has extended family, would be possible choices.Foreign minister S Jaishankar made it clear in Parliament that Hasina had sought approval to come to India only “for the moment”. India remains apprehensive about her opponents in Dhaka, with whom it needs to work now, using her extended stay to sow doubts about India’s intentions.Despite the setback caused by Hasina’s exit, India has said it wants its missions in Bangladesh to function normally once law and order is restored.Foreign minister S Jaishankar told an all-party meeting Tuesday that ousted Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina was in shock at the turn of events and the govt would discuss with her about her future course once she is settled down. Hasina, who landed in Hindon in a BAF aircraft with her sister on Monday, has been moved to a safehouse.Despite the setback caused by Sheikh Hasina’s exit, India has said it wants its missions in Bangladesh to function normally once law and order is restored.The UK Home Office would not officially comment on the asylum claim as such claims are confidential but Home Office sources told TOI, “It is not possible to apply for asylum from outside UK. The UK has a proud record of providing protection for people who need it. However, there is no provision within our immigration rules for someone to be allowed to travel to UK to seek asylum or temporary refuge. Those who need international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach, that is the fastest route to safety.”Strongly hinting Hasina should apply for asylum in India, the source added, “Each asylum claim is carefully considered on its individual merits on a case-by-case basis.”Hasina, 76, arrived at Hindon air base in Ghaziabad on Monday with her younger sister Sheikh Rehana (68) in a C-130 military plane and shifted to Delhi.Rehana already has political asylum in the UK and holds British citizenship. She took refuge in the UK after the assassination of her father, Bangladesh’s founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in 1975. The sisters had planned to move swiftly to London but will now have to rethink their next destination.Hasina’s niece Tulip Siddiq, who is Rehana’s daughter, is a Labour MP and is economic secretary to the Treasury in the new Labour govt.On Monday, UK foreign secretary David Lammy said, “The people of Bangladesh deserve a full and independent UN-led investigation into the events of the past few weeks.” He also said the UK wants to see action taken to ensure a peaceful and democratic future for Bangladesh.Bangladeshis made up the fifth largest nationality of main applications seeking asylum in the United Kingdom in 2023 numbering 4,300.The UK can also grant other forms of humanitarian protection to people who the Home Office decides need protection but who do not meet the criteria for refugee status. Hasina could apply for discretionary leave outside the immigration rules. Or she could go to the UK on a visa but it would be illegal to later apply for asylum unless she could prove a change in circumstances.","Sheikh Hasina is said to be exploring other options, including the US and Finland.

Anti-Immigrant Riots: Thousands of anti-racism demonstrators take to UK streets after week of far-right violence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/thousands-of-anti-racism-demonstrators-take-to-uk-streets-after-week-of-far-right-violence/articleshow/112362036.cms,"Britain braced for potential unrest on Wednesday as thousands of police officers were deployed across the country, fearing violence from far-right groups following a series of anti-immigrant riots in recent days. While the anticipated anti-immigration protests did not occur, thousands of anti-racism demonstrators gathered in cities with some demonstrations taking place near areas identified as potential riot targets.As the evening passed without major incidents, many people expressed relief that widespread violence had been avoided.The violent unrest that occurred in more than a dozen towns and cities across Britain over the past week was partly fueled by far-right agitators and an online disinformation campaign aimed at inciting chaos following a deadly knife attack on a children's dance class in northwestern England. False information spread online claimed that the teenage suspect, who was born in Britain, was an asylum seeker.The BBC reported that the suspect's parents were from Rwanda, though the police have not disclosed a motive for the attack due to strict reporting restrictions in Britain once legal proceedings begin.In response to heightened tensions, authorities deployed about 6,000 specialist public-order police officers across the country, increased patrols in several cities and towns, and granted police extended powers to arrest individuals suspected of intending to cause unrest, even before riots could begin.Among the few arrests on Wednesday night was a 40-year-old man from Eastleigh, detained by Hampshire police in Southampton for suspected violent or threatening behaviour following a small gathering of anti-immigration protesters who were outnumbered by counter protesters. In Bristol, there was one arrest after a brick and a bottle were thrown at a police vehicle, but overall, the demonstrations remained peaceful. Police dispersed a small group of anti-immigration protesters blocking a road in Portsmouth, and additional officers were deployed in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where unrest had persisted for at least four nights.Many businesses in the affected areas closed early, and parents were asked to pick up their children from nearby childcare centres. On Wednesday evening, protesters chanted ""Fascists out!"" and held signs reading ""Love Not Hate"" as a helicopter circled overhead. Although there was a significant police presence, the anticipated anti-immigration crowd did not appear. Instead, the diverse gathering included local residents surprised by the demonstration in their neighbourhood, union groups, and others condemning the recent violence in Britain.British Prime Minister Keir Starmer issued a warning late on Tuesday, stating that anyone involved in the violence would face ""the full force of the law.""

'Mindless killing changed everything': How Bangladesh's quota protests ended Sheikh Hasina's 15-year reign,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/mindless-killing-changed-everything-how-bangladeshs-quota-protests-ended-sheikh-hasinas-15-year-reign/articleshow/112295042.cms,"Driving the news

In a broadcast to the nation on state television, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, the army chief of Bangladesh, announced that Hasina had resigned and that the military would form a caretaker government .

. Dressed in military fatigues, Waker said, ""The country has suffered a lot, the economy has been hit, many people have been killed -- it is time to stop the violence.""

This announcement came shortly after jubilant crowds stormed and looted Hasina's residence.

In Dhaka, demonstrators scaled a monument dedicated to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of the current Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, and the founding father of Bangladesh. Once atop the statue, the protesters proceeded to use an axe to forcefully remove and damage the sculpted head of the revered figure.

External affairs minister S Jaishankar met PM Narendra Modi and briefed him developments in Bangladesh.

Meanwhile, Hasina reached India aboard a Bangladesh Air Force C-130J military transport aircraft, PTI reported quoting sources.

It remains uncertain whether the military transport plane will carry her onward from India or if she will switch to another aircraft for her journey to London, the PTI report said.

Why it matters

With over 32 million young people out of work or education in Bangladesh, the protests have tapped into widespread frustration over limited opportunities and economic challenges.

The absence of Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh's political landscape may exacerbate the country's already precarious situation.

Bangladesh, one of the world's most densely populated countries, faces high levels of unemployment, pervasive corruption, and the dire consequences of climate change. These crises have already placed a significant strain on the nation, and the departure of its leader could further compound these issues.

Zoom in

The unrest began in July 2024 when students initiated demonstrations demanding the abolition of a government job quota system that allocated a significant percentage of positions to the descendants of war veterans from the 1971 independence conflict.

The protests intensified after the high court reinstated a 30% job quota for the families of freedom fighters, sparking widespread outrage among students and young professionals who argue that the quotas perpetuate inequality and hinder merit-based hiring.

The government's attempt to reduce the quota to 5% failed to quell the unrest, with demonstrators demanding the complete abolition of the quota system.

The situation escalated dramatically on August 4, 2024 as violent confrontations erupted between protesters and supporters of the ruling Awami League , Chhatra League, and Jubo League activists.

, Chhatra League, and Jubo League activists. The protesters were mainly organized by the Students Against Discrimination, with the sole demand of Hasina's resignation over the job quota system.

So far, over 300 have died in these protests since July.

'Mindless killing changed everything'

What they are saying

""The country is going through a revolutionary period. ""I promise you all, we will bring justice to all the murders and injustice. We request you to have faith in the army of the country. I take full responsibility and I assure you to not get disheartened,"" the Bangladesh army chief said.

""I request you all to be a little patient, give us some time and together we will be able to solve all the problems,"" Zaman added. ""Please don't go back to the path of violence and please return to non-violent and peaceful ways.""

""15 consecutive years of power have been shattered by a people’s revolution. In the end, the Iron Lady had feet of clay,"" said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center.

""Bangladesh has achieved its second independence now,"" Abu Sayem told Reuters in Whitechapel, a London neighbourhood home to a large Bangladeshi community . ""We actually got our independence first in 1971 but autocrat Sheikh Hasina was ruling the country forcibly. She has snatched away our rights. She has killed thousands of children.""

What it means for India

Under Hasina, Bangladesh has emerged as one of the most trusted allies of India in South Asia.

Harsh Vardhan Shringla, the former foreign secretary of India, expressed concerns that an unstable Bangladesh could contribute to instability in certain regions of India.

""An unstable Bangladesh can add to instability in parts of our country, which we do not want to see. So, a peaceful, prosperous, stable Bangladesh is India's best. It is very important that we work with all concerned to ensure that our interests and those of Bangladesh are secured,"" Shringla told ANI.

Shringla expressed confidence that Indian representatives would engage with the relevant individuals in Bangladesh to protect India's broader interests and constructively promote peace and stability in the region.

""We have strong ties across the board in a multifaceted manner in Bangladeshi society. And, we will engage any political or any other organization that we need to in the furtherance of our larger interests and those of Bangladesh,"" he said.

What's next

The Hasina chapter seems to be over for Bangladesh. Sajeeb Wazed Joy, Hasina's son, told BBC that there would be no political come back for her. She was ""so disappointed that after all her hard work, for a minority to rise up against her,"" Joy said.

Hasina's departure ""would leave a major vacuum"" and that the country was in ""uncharted territory"". ""The coming days are critical, as it moves toward what will hopefully be a peaceful transition,"" Kugelman said.

""The key now is to move the process along, to create the interim set-up, to ease uncertainty and reduce the risk of more volatility.""

Now, all eyes will now be on the army chief.

Bangladesh was thrown into turmoil on Monday as Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina stepped down from her position and left the nation. Her resignation followed a brutal suppression of protests that had escalated from demonstrations against employment quotas into a full-scale movement calling for her removal from power. The crackdown resulted in the deaths of hundreds of individuals.The violent crackdown on protesters, which resulted in hundreds of deaths, fueled anger and resentment.""The killings definitely stand as the most brutal retaliation by a government on any civic movement in the post-liberation Bangladesh history—and may be that of the subcontinent. We shudder at the thought of how a civilian government could allow its law enforcers to attack its own people with such brutality. The killing was not just an event, but one that took place over several days. Wasn't there any reflection, any afterthought and reassessment at the end of the first, second or third day that such heartless and continuous killing of one's own people must stop,"" said Mahfuz Anam in column ""Mindless killing changed everything"" published in Daily Star.(With inputs from agencies)","Bangladesh's army chief announced that Hasina had resigned and that the military would form a caretaker government.

Imprisonment and education

After release

Hamas announced Yahya Sinwar as its new political leader on Tuesday, following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran .In a statement, the group said, ""The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas announces the selection of Yahya Sinwar as the head of the political bureau of the movement,"" reported AFP.Notably, Israeli military officials accuse Sinwar of being one of the masterminds behind the October 7 attack on Israel, making him one of Israel's most wanted militants.Minutes after the announcement, Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, reported firing a barrage of rockets from the Gaza Strip toward Israel.Born in Gaza in 1962 during the tumultuous period surrounding the creation of the state of Israel, Sinwar’s experiences influenced his decision to join Hamas in the 1980s.Recruited by Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, Sinwar became the head of an internal security unit known as Al Majd. His role involved punishing those suspected of violating Islamic laws or collaborating with Israel, which eventually led to his arrest by Israeli authorities, according to the New York Times.Imprisoned in 1988 for the murder of four Palestinians accused of apostasy or collaboration with Israel, Sinwar spent over two decades in an Israeli prison. During this time, he learned Hebrew, studied Israeli culture, and translated extensive Hebrew-language materials about Israeli security practices into Arabic.Israeli dentist Yuval Bitton, who treated Sinwar in prison, noted that Sinwar used his translated materials to educate fellow inmates about counterterrorism tactics. Sinwar, who described himself as a ""specialist in the Jewish people's history,"" focused his conversations on Hamas rather than personal matters.While imprisoned, Sinwar wrote a novel titled ""The Thorn and the Carnation,"" a coming-of-age story reflecting his own experiences. The novel depicts the life of a Gaza boy under Israeli occupation and the resistance's demands for sacrifice.Sinwar told an Italian journalist that prison is a crucible. ""Prison builds you,"" he said, adding that it gave him time to reflect on his beliefs and the price he would be willing to pay for them.Released in 2011 as part of a prisoner swap, the new Hamas political leader remarked that capturing Israeli soldiers was the most effective strategy for securing the release of Palestinians held by Israel. ""For the prisoner, capturing an Israeli soldier is the best news in the universe, because he knows that a glimmer of hope has been opened for him,"" Sinwar said at the time.Post-release, Sinwar married and started a family, though he has remained private about his personal life. He once mentioned that his son's first words included ""drone,"" highlighting his ongoing focus on conflict.Sinwar’s hard-line position suggests he is unlikely to support a cease-fire with Israel that would end the fighting in Gaza and resolve the situation of around 115 hostages still held by Hamas. According to Israeli and US intelligence sources, Sinwar aims to prolong the conflict to undermine Israel's international standing and its relationship with the United States.","Hamas announced Yahya Sinwar as its new political leader on Tuesday.

'Rocket man'

Former US President Donald Trump on Wednesday minced no words to stoke a conspiracy theory about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 's family roots. The republican nominee in an interview to a social media personality insinuated that the Canadian leader ""could be the son"" of the late communist leader Fidel Castro .After being shown the photo of the Canadian prime minister, the 45th president said, ""Trudeau turned very liberal actually.They say he’s the son of Fidel Castro and, uh, could be. I mean anything’s possible in this world, you know,” he said.Trump added that he ""got along very well"" with Trudeau, but suggested that he didn't approve of his policies.""He seems to be going very progressive and the people of Canada are not liking it,"" he said.Trump, who has taken a convenient liking to conservative leaders around the world, said that a conservative candidate in Canada could win the next election, referring to Pierre Poilievre leading Trudeau in recent opinion polls. ""If they had a good conservative person — maybe they do, maybe they don't. I don't know. But somebody that's a strong conservative would win in Canada,"" Trump said.The conspiracy had previously been shared widely on social media after Castro's death in 2016 and Trudeau calling him a “legendary revolutionary and orator”. Trudeau was born on Dec. 25, 1971, to Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and his wife Margaret more than four years before Margaret reportedly made a much spoken about trip to Cuba and met Castro.The Feb. 1 suicide of Castro’s oldest son in 2018 also added fuel to the fire with several reports claiming that Fidelito left a suicide note referring to Justin Trudeau as his half-brother. However, Trudeau at the time outright denied the claims and said his parents never visited Cuba until several years after he was born.In the interview with Adin Ross, Trump also went about his relationships with other world leaders and public figures, including a number of Democrats, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who he called a “genius” and “a very good person,” and Chinese president Xi Jin Ping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who he said has a “good relationship with him.""Donald Trump, who claimed he received a beautiful note from the Chinese leader Xi Jinping after he survived an assassination attempt by a whisker, reiterated that he gets along with him very well.“I will have a very good relationship with him. There’s no, there’s no going to war with him. He doesn’t want to go to war. We’re not going to war…. He loves his country and he’s very strong and powerful.”Trump also claimed that unlike the Biden administration, he shared a ""relationship like nobody else."" However, he also added that he exposed China during the Covid and vowed to not let China let take advantage, which he said is in the best interests of America.Referring to the Chinese president's visit during his tenure, Trump belittled the Biden administration for not working enough with China and against, when the situation demanded.Trump, often not backing off from showing his strange affection for the North Korean leader yet again in the interview with the controversial internet personality said, Kim Jong Un is ""very smart"" and ""a real power."" The 45th president said he played Elton John’s hit song “Rocket Man” for the dictator when they met in Singapore in 2018, after he had nicknamed Kim “Little Rocket Man” over his nuclear claims.Trump said his administration checked ""closely"" and determined that Kim had ""tremendous nuclear capability.""Trump, who to much attention of the world community paid visit to North Korea during his tenure said, ""I got to know him very well, and I got along with him great,"" he explained. ""He's very strong. He's the absolute leader. You know, a lot of people say, oh, maybe he's not the leader. He's the absolute. When he's around, his people are standing up at attention.""Trump also said the North Korean dictator had an opinion about vice president Kamala Harris. ""He doesn't know her, but he forms opinions, and he doesn't like her,"" he asserted. ""And he thought that Biden was a stupid man, a very stupid man.""""But I say the same thing. So at least we agree on something.""","Former US President Donald Trump stoke a conspiracy theory about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's family roots.

Uricchio was dressed in a dark blue shirt and boxer shorts at the time of his arrest, according to the police report obtained by the Hour.Uricchio, whose hands appeared to be covered in blood, was directed by the police to approach them with his arms outstretched. After checking Uricchio for any weapons, the authorities asked about his father, Marc Uricchio. Uricchio confessed, ""I murdered him,"" further stating that he had killed his father “really, really badly.”According to New York Post, upon entering the residence, investigators reportedly discovered blood drops on the stairs and walls.

Jeffrey Raines told the News-Times that this was Ridgefield's first murder case since 2003. He expressed his concern, stating, the killing “shakes the town up. This is a very safe community,” he added.Shortly after being taken into custody, Uricchio informed the officers that he was experiencing stomach issues due to consuming a significant amount of Advil earlier. Authorities said that Uricchio was then taken to Danbury Hospital, where he underwent an evaluation by medical staff while restrained to a hospital bed with handcuffs.During his time at the hospital, Uricchio told the doctors that he had been prescribed medication which he had not taken ""in a month or two,"" and that he frequently used cannabis.Uricchio was released from medical care and returned to the Ridgefield police station, where he was placed under close observation on suicide watch.During his court appearance at Danbury Superior Court on Monday, Uricchio appeared to be in a nearly unresponsive state, requiring physical assistance to enter the courtroom, according to the News-Times.He remained slumped over, with his head resting on the defense table, until instructed by the judge to stand up, at which point a nearby officer had to practically lift him to his feet.Willie Dow, Uricchio's defense attorney, informed the court of his client's ""significant mental health history."" Dow concurred with the prosecution's request for an evaluation of competency, provision of mental health treatment, and continued monitoring for potential suicide risk, all of which were granted by the presiding judge.Uricchio is scheduled to return to court on September 4th and is currently being held on a bail amount of $1.5 million.","Steven James Uricchio, 31, charged with murder in the death of his 83-year-old father in Ridgefield, Connecticut.

Several political parties have extensively used X to present their case.The most notable is the Pakistan-Tehreek-e-Insaaf, whose jailed leader former PM Imran Khan has used X to present his point of view on various cases against him. The PTI has also used X to call for rallies and protests against the Shehbaz Sharif government. Even on Saturday, the PTI X timeline was abuzz with calls for the national protest rally in Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Khan has also been able to address election rallies using Artificial Intelligence and pushed his cause effectively on social media.In a statement posted by the PTI's Canada office, the party criticised the move saying the government was scared of informed voices.""First they ban X on flimsy 'national security' grounds, now they're coming for VPNs.

Jailed former Pak PM Imran Khan's party vows to form 'grand opposition alliance' against ruling PML-N govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/jailed-former-pak-pm-imran-khans-party-vows-to-form-grand-opposition-alliance-against-ruling-pml-n-govt/articleshow/112222202.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Jailed former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan has approved the formation of a ""grand opposition alliance"" by expanding the existing platform, Tehreek Tahafuz-e-Ayin-e-Pakistan, to act as a powerful anti-government movement, a senior party leader has said. Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, who addressed reporters alongside the party's secretary-general Omar Ayub Khan outside Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail where the 71-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician is lodged since last August, said that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has decided to expand the opposition alliance in a meeting with Imran Khan on Thursday, Geo News reported.Qaiser announced that the former ruling party would gather all opposition parties to run a powerful anti-government movement. He said that the party's forthcoming power show in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Swabi was aimed at raising a ""strong voice"" for the release of the PTI founder and other detained leaders.""This country will only be governed in accordance with the law and the Constitution,"" Qaiser emphasised.During his address, Qaiser also rebuked the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz-led coalition government over skyrocketing power bills. He said the bloated electricity bills were ""unacceptable"" for the inflation-hit masses.The PTI leader also said that they support Jamaat-e-Islami's (JI) sit-in - underway on Rawalpindi's Murree Road since July 26 - against the massive hike in power bills.However, JI Emir Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman has said that his party would not become part of the PTI proposed grand alliance as history suggests that the opposition parties use such platforms for self-interest.""We will have the same stance as the opposition parties on some issues and hold meetings with them, but we will not become part of any alliance,"" Naeem said on Thursday.Ayub, while addressing the same press conference, appealed to the masses to attend the public gathering in Swabi on August 5 in large numbers from across the country to show solidarity with the former premier.Responding to criticism against the PTI founder for demanding negotiations with the Pakistan Army, Ayub said that they did not hold any discussion regarding the dialogue, however, he added that Khan made it clear that the military belongs to the nation and vice versa.He further said that the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) were trying to drive a wedge between the military and the nation.Commenting on the cases against the jailed ex-prime minister, the opposition leader said that they were fighting a legal battle for Khan's release. Ayub blamed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) for stopping the release of former first lady Bushra Bibi despite having no connections with the Toshakhana corruption case.The PTI secretary general demanded Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa and Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Aamer Farooq to recuse themselves from hearing the PTI founder's cases, Geo News reported.The PTI believes he is being arrested in more cases at the behest of the powerful military establishment to make sure that he does not come out of jail.Khan was first arrested by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in a 190-million-pound corruption case. He faces over 200 cases and has been in jail since August last year.","Imran Khan has approved the formation of a ""grand opposition alliance"" by expanding the existing platform.
