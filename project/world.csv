An inquiry by the director of the state Directorate of Industrial Training revealed that the allegations against the superintendent could not be substantiated as the accusers could not provide any proof.The school superintendent then filed a criminal defamation case against the mass petitioners, claiming they had not only maligned him but tarnished his image in the eyes of all concerned, including teachers, students, staff members, guardians and locals.The main contention before Justice Ajay Kumar Gupta was whether the mass complaint could be punishable as defamation, criminal intimidation, and criminal conspiracy. Justice Gupta ruled out defamation, observing that the mass complaint was on a matter of public interest that was submitted to an authority, and was never made public as per the claims of the mass petitioners.""This mass petition is for the protection of the institution or the students or their own rights and interest and cannot be construed as malice and imputation of reputation in public or society as such, cannot be said to have been made with intent to defame the complainant,"" the court said.",Calcutta high court quashes defamation case against 287 people.

What Elon Musk said on Donald Trump’s 25% import tariff announcement on auto parts

US President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on auto imports and parts. “What we're going to be doing is a 25 percent tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States,” Trump said, as he signed the order in the Oval Office on March 26. The tariffs take effect on April 3 and apply to foreign-made cars, light trucks, and key auto parts. Responding to the development, Tesla CEO and Trump ally Elon Musk said that “this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries”. Musk quoted a post by Tesla Owners Silicon Valley @teslaownersSV which said that “Trump imposes 25% tariff on all cars not made in the United States. Tesla could benefit the most on this.”Clarifying the post, Musk wrote: “To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries. The cost impact is not trivial.”President Donald Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on additional goods, including pharmaceuticals, noting that most drugs available in the U.S. are manufactured abroad, primarily in China and Ireland.Regarding reciprocal tariffs, Trump stated that the U.S. wouldn’t match exact levels set by trading partners but stressed that no country would be exempt.“We're going to make it to all countries, and we're going to make it very lenient,” he said. “I think people are going to be very surprised. It'll be, in many cases, less than the tariff that they've been charging us for decades.”He added that the U.S. would be “very fair” and “very nice” in its approach, despite what he described as unfair treatment by other nations.","US President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on auto imports and parts.

Students claim that police arrested them arbitrarily and entered academic spaces while they protested the deployment of earth movers on university land.

Cyberabad police reported that 52 protesters were taken into preventive custody and are considering filing criminal charges against some students for obstructing officials and assaulting police officers.

"We want our guardian back, says RPP, calls for Hindu Rashtra",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/we-want-our-guardian-back-says-rpp-calls-for-hindu-rashtra/articleshow/119834327.cms,"KATHMANDU: Swati Thapa , central committee member of Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), weighs her words carefully. “The people want the king back,” she says. “Not as a ruler. As a guardian. A stabilising force. And they want Nepal restored as a Hindu rashtra . These are not political slogans anymore — they’re the people’s survival instincts.”RPP was formed in 1990 following the restoration of multi-party democracy. It began with four seats in the 1991 parliamentary elections and has remained a fluctuating but persistent presence in Nepali politics, often playing the role of kingmaker. In 2022, RPP secured 14 of 275 seats in the federal parliament, marking a modest resurgence. The party was part of the current coalition government until Feb 2023, when it withdrew support.Her party – from which several senior leaders have been arrested or detained – has long championed these demands: the return of a constitutional monarchy, the removal of the country’s “expensive” federal structure, and reinstatement of Nepal as a Hindu state. The return of Nepal as a Hindu rashtra is central to RPP’s vision. “This country became secular without asking its people. That’s the truth,” she said. “We believe more than 80% of Nepalis still want a Hindu state.”Thapa brushes off the concern that RPP’s agenda might alienate moderates or minorities. “This doesn’t mean discrimination (against other communities). It means protection of what’s ours. We respect every religion. But we will not lose ourselves in the process. Why must we keep apologising for our roots?” she said.She alleges that “coerced” conversions — particularly in remote and poor areas — are altering the cultural fabric of the country. “Foreign aid is being used to change who we are,” she said, naming Western agencies as enablers. “We respect all faiths. But this cannot come at the cost of Nepal’s soul.”.Former king Gyanendra Shah’s re-emergence has been a flashpoint in the country. His recent ""return"" to Kathmandu saw enormous crowds — but he remains silent. Is that silence a strategy or a missed moment? “He is not responsible for this movement. He is above all that is happening,” Thapa insisted. “And we don’t want to drag him into daily politics. But the people still revere him. They see him as someone who didn’t steal from them. Someone they can trust. So even his silence has weight.”She confirmed that RPP maintains contact with the royal family and said ""monarchy must remain above political manoeuvring"". On the tricky subject of succession — especially given public unease with Gyanendra’s son, Paras — Thapa is straightforward. “We’ve said clearly: succession should not be automatic.Thapa said, “We've been saying clearly: succession will be from the king's linage. Gyanendra might skip a generation as his has publicly said that he has no interest to rule the country. But it could be his son, grandson or someone from their family. Whatever decision will be taken that will be later after restoration of the monarchy.’When prodded that it's not really how monarchies work, she said that a member of the royal family would always wear the crown, but it would not necessarily be the eldest son. “The bloodline would be at the bottom of our list of what makes our king,” she said. “We’re not talking about bringing back direct rule. The king would be symbolic. The executive power would rest with a directly elected prime minister. But we need a figure above the fray. Someone the country can rally around.”Even if RPP succeeds, the road to restoring a monarchy, even a constitutional one, would take some time. And if not the king, then who? “There is no Plan B,” she said. “That is our honest answer. We see no other figure who can command the trust of the people. That’s why we want the monarchy — not for nostalgia, but because the republic has failed to offer us a credible alternative.”That sentiment has long existed within the party. But in recent weeks, it has found unexpected traction beyond it.What was once a political platform has spilled onto the streets. The slogans once confined to RPP rallies are now the chants of thousands. On March 28, these protests turned violent. Two people, including a journalist, died. Over a hundred were injured. More than 50 — including RPP veterans Rabindra Mishra and MP Dhawal Shumsher Rana — were arrested.“We are not leading all these protests,” Thapa clarified. “But we have given moral support to those that share our goals. This is a joint effort, driven by the public. We are not claiming ownership, and we don’t want to. That would be missing the point.”She said RPP’s movement has been non-violent, with a set calendar of demonstrations. “Our programme has always been peaceful. What happened on March 28 wasn’t who we are.” Thapa blamed state provocation. “We have footage of tear gas fired from rooftops by police in civilian clothes. The crowd was unarmed.” The party has called for a thorough investigation and continues to protest in all 77 districts.Thapa described the surge in support as driven by a profound loss of direction. “People aren’t just angry. They’re exhausted. Corruption, inflation, political instability...”When asked about the absence of political flags at rallies, she said she views it as an affirmation rather than a threat. “We’re proud to see the national flag. Even in our own programmes, we use it. It’s not about RPP. It’s about Nepal.”One of the more visible faces during the recent mobilisation has been controversial figure and former Maoist Durga Prasai, whom some have criticised for inflammatory rhetoric. “We supported the agenda he stood for,” Thapa said. “That doesn’t mean we support everything about his style. Our commitment is to peaceful protest. Anyone who wants the same future for Nepal is welcome — but not at the cost of our principles.”As the protests evolve and the govt continues its crackdown, Thapa said she and her party remain firm. “This is not a passing storm. It’s a reckoning. And it’s just beginning.”","Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) was formed in 1990 following the restoration of multi-party democracy.

Shivangini Rana

KATHMANDU: Rumours swirled in Kathmandu on Monday that two senior Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) leaders could face treason charges — a crime punishable by life imprisonment in Nepal — after police produced them in court for involvement in the March 28 pro-monarchy violence in which two persons, including a journalist, were killed. The passports of current MP Dhawal Shumsher Rana and Rabindra Mishra have been revoked, and demands to impound former king Gyanendra Shah ’s passport were raised in parliament, Rana’s family members told TOI on Monday evening.RPP senior vice-president Mishra and general secretary Rana, a member of the lower house, were remanded in custody for five days by Kathmandu district court judge Taradevi Maharjan. The court permitted further investigation under charges related to crimes against the state. The duo were among 11 people presented in court on Monday, said court information officer Deepak Kumar Shrestha. Mishra was handcuffed; Rana was not.Rana’s daughter Shivangini told TOI that her father had been diagnosed with cancer in Nepal and treated at the Head and Neck Cancer Institute of India in Mumbai in September. He had just completed a round of radiation therapy and was due to return to India for follow-up treatment, but was not allowed to leave. “I won’t be surprised if they (govt) slap ridiculous charges against him,” she said. “Their passports have also been impounded. Neither he nor Mishra can leave the country now. He was due for treatment in India, but it is now clear that he cannot leave Nepal anytime soon.”Shivangini added that the family had been informed verbally by officials that the passports of both leaders were being held “until further notice”, but no formal communication had been received.Meanwhile, during a session of the federal parliament on Monday, lawmakers from the ruling coalition demanded that former king Gyanendra Shah’s passport also be impounded in connection with the violent demonstrations. Rastriya Janamorcha MP Chitra Bahadur KC said that a thorough investigation into the former king’s role was “essential to protect the republic”.Ramhari Sharma Kafle, chief of the Kathmandu district public prosecutor ’s office, said Mishra, Rana and others may be charged with crimes against the state after preliminary investigation. Of the nearly 200 persons – locals, members of various political parties – arrested and detained so far, police have produced 42 people in court, including those held under charges of criminal mischief and organised crime. The rest are under further investigation, police said.According to officials, the March 28 ‘ Janadolan ’ — led by Durga Prasai’s Nepal Royalist Movement — turned violent and led to widespread vandalism in Kathmandu. Protesters allegedly damaged homes, a hospital, vehicles, and a political party office, and looted a shopping mall. They also reportedly seized a weapon from the armed police. The aam sabha was led by Prasai. Rana was called in as a moral supporter and guest. Businessman-activist Prasai was appointed its ""people’s commander"".Police said Prasai has been on the run since Friday’s protest. On Sunday, he released a video on Facebook saying he was staying in a temple in the capital. Meanwhile, police arrested Gopal Malla, 38, from Bhimsen Gola for allegedly stealing a gas gun from an armed police officer during the violence. The gun has not yet been recovered. Malla, originally from Sainamaina municipality in Rupandehi, now resides in Tarakeshwar-10, Kathmandu.In another development, Kathmandu Metropolitan City has fined Gyanendra Shah Nepalese Rs 793,000 (INR 4 lakh) for protest-related damage. Officials issued the fine over multiple infractions, including littering streets, breaking public railings and damaging fire engines used during the protest. The city police attempted to deliver the letter at Gyanendra’s estate Nirmal Niwas but were turned away by his staff. The notice was subsequently sent by post.Shivangini added that Rana was among the few MPs to oppose foreign influence in Nepal’s political affairs. “In Parliament, he was the only MP who spoke against over 100 million dollars that came into Nepal to promote secularism and conversion,” she said, referencing remarks made by former US president Donald Trump.According to Shivangini, her father supports restoring Nepal as a Hindu kingdom. “He believes bringing back the monarchy and Hindu Rashtra can restore dignity and unite the people. The current democratic system and elected parties have failed the country. He always says, ‘To change the situation, we must change the system.’”On the day of the protest, she said Rana was not the organiser but attended as coordinator of the Janandolan committee. “It was organised by Durga Prasai. My father was present to speak, but before he could, tear gas shells landed on the stage. Everyone ran,” she said. “There were others who provoked the crowd. My father wasn’t one of them. He was unarmed, standing in the middle of the road.”Shivangini showed TOI the video footage that she said showed Rana urging protestors not to resort to violence. “Even after police began firing tear gas, he was asking people not to throw stones and trying to manage the crowd,” she said. “Yet they are talking about charging him with treason.” She said Rana’s driver was shot twice during the protest. “He was just standing next to my father. That bullet could have hit him.”She also alleged the police action was premeditated. “Officers were stationed on rooftops. As soon as we started the national anthem, tear gas rained down. The crowd hadn’t even fully gathered yet. It was all staged,” she said. “We’ve always said our protest will be peaceful, like Mahatma Gandhi’s. We don’t believe in violence.”Shivangini said the govt is deliberately building a case against her father. “There’s fear in the govt. This movement has shaken the country. People are fed up with corruption and political failure. That’s why they want to silence voices like his.”",RPP senior vice-president Mishra and general secretary Rana remanded in custody for five days by Kathmandu district court judge Taradevi Maharjan. The court permitted further investigation under charges related to crimes against the state. Rana’s daughter Shivangini told TOI that her father had been diagnosed with cancer in Nepal and treated at the Head and Neck Cancer Institute of India in Mumbai.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119841022,imgsize-48508,width-400,resizemode-4/119841022.jpg"

Trump Flips On Putin After SURPRISE Criticism; ‘He’ll Live Up To…’ | Big U-Turn Jolts Zelensky

Three of the four US soldiers who went missing in Lithuania last week have been confirmed dead after rescuers retrieved their armored vehicle from a peat bog, the US Army announced. The fourth soldier remains unaccounted for.The soldiers disappeared during a tactical training exercise on a large military range near Pabradė, an area located close to the Belarusian border. Lithuanian authorities were alerted to their disappearance on Tuesday, prompting an intense search operation.Maj. Gen. Christopher Norrie , commander of the 3rd Infantry Division, expressed deep sorrow for the fallen soldiers, saying, “We stand in grief with the families and loved ones of these extraordinary ‘dogface soldiers’ during this unimaginable time. But the search isn’t finished until everyone is home. Words cannot express our gratitude to those still working around the clock during these extensive search and recovery efforts and your unwavering commitment not to rest until all are found.”A six-day recovery mission, involving US, Polish, and Lithuanian military personnel, ultimately led to the discovery of the three soldiers' bodies after their armored vehicle, an M88 Hercules, was found in the bog. The recovery process involved the use of heavy equipment and excavators to remove the thick silt and water surrounding the vehicle before it was pulled out early Monday morning.According to US Army Europe and Africa ’s public affairs office, the soldiers were assigned to the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division.“Three US Army soldiers assigned to 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division were found deceased in Lithuania today, 31 March,” the statement read, adding that their identities would be withheld until their families were notified.The recovery operation was extensive, with hundreds of local and foreign personnel involved, including engineers, divers, and rescue workers. The Lithuanian Armed Forces contributed military helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, unmanned aerial systems, and specialized personnel. Heavy construction equipment and technical experts were also mobilised to assist in the effort.US Navy divers played a crucial role, maneuvering through thick layers of mud and sediment with zero visibility to attach steel cables to the 63-tonne vehicle. Despite challenges, including the vehicle losing traction during the extraction, additional bulldozers were brought in to assist. The vehicle was finally freed after two hours of intense work.As the search continues for the fourth soldier, Maj. Gen. Curtis Taylor , commander of Task Force Iron and the 1st Armored Division, thanked all those involved in the operation, describing their efforts as “heroic.” The US Army and Lithuanian authorities are investigating the cause of the incident.Lithuania, a Nato and EU member, hosts more than 1,000 US troops stationed on a rotational basis, strengthening the alliance's presence in the region.","The soldiers disappeared during a tactical training exercise on a large military range near Pabradė.

What do experts say?

Is there a timeline for lifting the freeze?

What is the broader impact of this policy?

The Trump administration has paused the processing of certain green card applications, intensifying concerns among Indian immigrants, one of the largest migrant communities in the United States. The move is part of a broader immigration crackdown focused on increased scrutiny and national security checks.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stated that the pause is in line with two executive orders signed by Donald Trump. These orders aim to enhance immigrant screening for potential fraud, public safety threats, and national security risks.The suspension impacts immigrants applying for permanent residency, including Indian nationals. With over 2.9 million Indian immigrants in the US as of 2023, many now face prolonged delays and legal uncertainties.Laura Collins, director at the Bush Institute-SMU Economic Growth Initiative, told NBC News, “All these people who are approved to remain in the United States have already passed government scrutiny.” She argued that further delays are unnecessary.Azadeh Erfani from the National Immigrant Justice Center told Newsweek, “This sweeping and indefinite stop on green card processing is yet another attempt for this administration to baselessly paint all immigrants as a national security risk.”The Trump administration has not provided any timeline for when green card processing will resume, leaving thousands of applicants uncertain about their future.This move aligns with Trump’s larger push to tighten immigration policies, including plans to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. Critics argue the pause unfairly targets legal immigrants and creates further bureaucratic hurdles.Recently, the Trump administration has detained individuals with ties to American universities, many of whom have supported pro-Palestinian causes, as part of a crackdown on immigrants. Among the detained is Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, arrested under accusations of supporting Hamas. Other individuals detained include Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist, Yunseo Chung, a US resident arrested at a protest, and Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown scholar accused of spreading Hamas propaganda.The US government has also taken action against several other activists, including Leqaa Kordia, Ranjani Srinivasan, and Alireza Doroudi, with many facing deportation or detention. Some of these individuals are accused of advocating for violence or engaging in political protests.","The Trump administration has paused the processing of certain green card applications.

Trump doesn't rule out seeking a third term in NBC News interview

Can Trump legally run for a third term?



America 101: Why Do We Have Presidential Term Limits? | History

Are there any alternative ways?



An effort to 'dismantle democracy' or does America 'need him'?



Donald Trump made headlines again on Sunday after he reiterated that he might pursue a third term as US president, even though such a move would challenge the constitutional two-term limit established by the 22nd Amendment .“There are methods which you could do it,” Trump said, adding, “I’m not joking,” in a telephone interview with NBC News.Later, talking to the reporters, he said that there were demands from the people for him to run for a third term.""I have had more people ask me to have a third term, which in a way is a fourth term because the other election, the 2020 election was totally rigged. I don’t want to talk about a third term now because no matter how you look at it, we’ve got a long time to go,” Trump said, who would be 82 by the end of his potential second term.Though a third term for any US president would typically be unthinkable, Donald Trump has never followed political norms. Throughout his time in office, he has repeatedly tested the boundaries of presidential power and has shown a willingness to bend or even break the law to remain in office.The 22nd Amendment, enacted in 1951 after Franklin D Roosevelt’s four consecutive terms, limits a US president to two elected terms.Any attempt by Trump to remain in office beyond this limit would be legally questionable, and it remains uncertain how seriously he intends to pursue the idea.When asked if one option could be having vice president JD Vance run for president and then ""pass the baton"" back to him, Trump acknowledged, ""Well, that’s one. But there are others too. There are others."" However, he refused to elaborate further.Nine US presidents have assumed office without being elected, all having previously served as vice presidents before stepping in due to the death or resignation of their predecessors. This historical precedent highlights alternative paths to the presidency beyond direct election. However, whether a two-term president could return to office via the vice presidency remains a legal gray area, The Conversation reported.The 22nd Amendment restricts a president to two elected terms but does not explicitly prevent them from serving as vice president. Meanwhile, the 12th Amendment states that anyone “constitutionally ineligible” for the presidency cannot be vice president. It is unclear whether this applies to a two-term president or only to basic eligibility requirements such as age, citizenship, and residency.If this issue were taken to the US Supreme Court, their ruling could determine whether a Trump-Vance ticket in 2024 might evolve into a Vance-Trump ticket in 2028. If elected under such a scenario, Vance could resign, allowing Trump to assume the presidency once again—a legal loophole that, if upheld, could redefine presidential succession.The political leaders reacted differently to Trump's remark with the right-wing leaders favouring the US president while the Democrats called it an effort to ""dismantle democracy"".“This is yet another escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy. If Congressional Republicans believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing Trump’s ambitions for a third term,” Democrat and representative Daniel Goldman said.Kayla Thompson, a 30-year-old former paralegal in Wisconsin, said she would “absolutely” like Trump to serve another term. “America needs him. America is headed in the right direction and, if he doesn’t do it, we’re probably headed backwards,"" she said.","Donald Trump doesn't rule out seeking a third term in NBC News interview.

Hope Walz , the daughter of Minnesota Governor and Kamala Harris's running mate Tim Walz, announced on Tiktok that she would not go to a graduate school because of the stand these schools have taken in the wake of Donald Trump's administration's crackdown on international students. She said she is not worried about her protection as she's a privileged white woman but she is in no rush to choose a college that doe not align with her values. Hope said she would research more and would take a gap year as she would not be going to the school that she initially decided.Hope said she would not give money to an institution that does not support students. “I applied for one school. I kind of had my heart set on it. I am not going to name the institution, but given recent events I am not going to give my money, go into debt for, or support institutions that do not support students and the right to protest and speak out for their communities,” Hope said without taking any name.“Students deserve to be protected. I am not worried about if I were to be protected or not at said institution. I am, you know, a privileged white woman. But I am not going to put myself in the position where I am giving money or supporting institutions that don’t support their students,” she added.The Trump administration has targeted Ivy League institutions for the pro-Palestine protests that took place in campuses last year. The most prominent action has been the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, who is a green card holder but the administration said his citizenship would be revoked and he would be deported to Gaza because he supports Hamas. Several other student visa holders have been arrested, deported, sending a strong message to these institutions.Columbia University agreed to change several policies adhering to the demands of the Trump administration. The university's interim president Katrina Armstrong resigned from her role. It is not only Columbia that has faced funding cuts. The Trump administration has warned 60 universities that funding may be cancelled if allegations of antisemitism on campuses are not addressed.Earlier this month, Linda McMahon, the secretary of education, announced that it was pulling federal funding because of ""relentless violence, intimidation, and antisemitic harassment"" which had been ""ignored"" by university authorities.",Hope Walz is the daughter of Minnesota Governor and Kamala Harris's running mate Tim Walz.

And it has put a lot of Americans out of business, out of work over the past several decades.

FBI director Kash Patel made the release of Epstein files his day 1 promise but the release fell short of the expectation as people speculated that Epstein's clint list was kept highly redacted because of the involvement of prominent Republicans.The demand to release the full list gained ground on Monday after Virginia Giuffre , the most prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein , made a social media post claiming that she is dying. With a battered picture of herself from a hospital bed with her face covered in bruises, she let the world know that a bus crashed into her vehicle recently and now she was suffering from kidney failure.“This year has been the worst start to a new year, but I won’t bore anyone with the details but I think it important to note that when a school bus driver comes at you driving [60 mph] as we were slowing for a turn that no matter what your car is made of it might as well be a tin can,” she wrote in the post on Sunday.“I’ve gone into kidney renal failure, they’ve given me four days to live, transferring me to a specialist hospital in urology. I’m ready to go, just not until I see my babies one last time, but you know what they say about wishes. S**T in one hand and wish in the other & I guarantee it’s still going to be s**t at the end of the day.“Thank you all for being the wonderful people of the world and for being a great part of my life,” she added.It's not known where the accident took place but Giuffre has been living in Western Australia.Guiffre is known for accusing not only Epstein but also Prince Andrew , King Charles III's oldest brother. Guiffre made bombshell claims that Andrew took part in Epstein's sex trafficking ring.Giuffre launched the legal action against billionaire financier Epstein in 2015, alleging that she was sex trafficked at the age of 16 after his ex-lover and accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell recruited her from her job as a locker room attendant at President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.Giuffre also alleged she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew on three occasions when she was 17 — including on Epstein’s Little St James island, in New Mexico and in Maxwell’s London home.Just before Epstein’s death, Giuffre released a manuscript including more than 2,000 documents of a lawsuit against Epstein and his famous associates.That same year, Prince Andrew paid Giuffre and her victims’ rights charity an out-of-court settlement reported to be around $12 million.","Virginia Giuffre, the most prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, made a social media post claiming that she is dying.

Harris told Biden 'this is important for your legacy'



A forthcoming book on Kamala Harris's presidential election which already hit the headlines because of the sensational revelations it made has claimed that Kamala Harris had to plead former president Joe Biden for a prompt endorsement for her as the presidential candidate. Biden's announcement was only about his decision to step away from the presidential fight.“You need to endorse me,” Harris begged Biden in the moments before the ticket switch-up, as reported by The Hill’s Amie Parnes and NBC News’s Jonathan Allen in excerpts from “FIGHT: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House,” which is set for release Tuesday.The book revealed that Harris knew that the nomination was coming her way but she did not want a bigger gap between Joe Biden's exit and his statement of support for Kamala Harris.“She knew that if Biden stepped aside without explicitly backing her, it would be taken as a statement that he lacked confidence in her ability to win or to do the job —­ or both,” according to the book. “That could mean crib death for a battle that she had not yet begun to fight. She also knew that a failure to throw his weight behind her would suggest that he had made the wrong decision in choosing her as his number two in the first place.”The book revealed that Harris told Biden that endorsing his straightaway would be important for Biden's legacy that he has absolute faith in his VP. When Biden suggested waiting a couple of days after his exit announcement to make the endorsement, Harris said “too much daylight” would risk “mischief and confusion"", the book said.When Biden ran his statement by Rep. James Clyburn, the South Carolina Democrat said “there’s something missing” and stressed the president couldn’t “leave the field without endorsing a successor,” Parnes and Allen reported. Clyburn had the same apprehension like Harris that if Biden leaves without endorsing a name, it would lead to a vacuum.""Obama’s going to try to rope me into some kind of mini-­ primary,’ Clyburn thought. ‘It will be easier to fend him off if I’ve already endorsed Harris.’ When Obama called that evening, the conversation lasted less than a minute. Clyburn said the party should unify behind Harris and that ‘anything else will lead to a real tough convention, which will lead to defeat at the polls.’”","Harris told Biden 'this is important for your legacy' according to a forthcoming book.

Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.The operation, in Katlang, a remote hilltop area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, was aimed at militant hideouts and resulted in the deaths of 12 suspected terrorists. However, it also led to the deaths of 10 civilians, including women and children, sparking outrage.Government spokesman Muhammad Ali Saif confirmed the casualties and said that the location was being used as a hideout and transit point for terrorists. He admitted that unarmed civilians were present at the site.""The safety of civilians is always a top priority during such operations. However, due to complex geography, terrorists using civilian populations as cover, and the urgent nature of the operation, unintended consequences can sometimes occur,"" said Saif, as quoted by the Associated Press.The provincial government has now promised an inquiry into how the operation led to civilian deaths.Local residents reported that the victims were nomads from the Swat region who had been living in the Shamozai mountains with their livestock. Their families protested by placing their bodies on the Swat Highway, demanding justice.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur called the incident “highly condemnable and tragic.” He assured that every effort is made to avoid civilian casualties but acknowledged the challenges of military operations in complex terrains where militants embed themselves among civilians.The government said medical aid is being provided to the injured, and compensation for the victims' families is being arranged. A provincial press note said the operation had ""neutralised several high-value militant targets"" but admitted that the “fog of war” sometimes leads to unintended consequences.","Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.

Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295"", a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.The case was filed after his video promoting the fragrance sparked outrage, particularly from the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which places blasphemy at the core of its political agenda.Butt, who boasts millions of followers online, announced the perfume in a now-deleted video, referencing Section 295 of Pakistan’s penal code, which deals with blasphemy. The move triggered widespread condemnation, with TLP leader Haider Ali Shah Gillani filing a formal complaint against him on Monday.""There are numerous sections in the penal code, but why did he choose blasphemy-related sections to name a perfume?"" Gillani was quoted by the news agency AFP, accusing Butt of attempting to ""normalise"" disrespect towards religious laws.According to AFP, the police charge sheet confirms that Butt has been charged under both blasphemy and cybercrime laws. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.As the controversy increased, Butt released an apology video on Sunday, holding a Quran as he sought forgiveness. ""I apologise for the words I uttered during the launch of the perfume,"" he said. He also announced the immediate discontinuation of the product.The controversy also relates to the late Indian rapper Sidhu Moose Wala ’s song ""295,"" which also referenced blasphemy laws. Butt had previously likened himself to Moose Wala, claiming they both faced persecution under similar legal provisions, according to Daily Pakistan.This is not Butt’s first legal battle. In January, he pleaded guilty to illegally owning a lion cub, which he had received as a wedding gift.A Pakistani court ordered him to create 12 educational videos on animal welfare as part of his punishment. He avoided jail time by pledging to use his platform to raise awareness about responsible treatment of wild animals.Blasphemy remains an extremely sensitive issue in Pakistan, where accusations, often unverified, can lead to mob violence and even killings.The legal provisions under Section 295 have been widely criticised by human rights groups for being used as a tool to target individuals, including religious minorities and public figures.","Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295,"" a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.

QUETTA: The Balochistan government , under the leadership of chief minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti , has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities , as reported by ARY News.In a high-level meeting chaired by CM Bugti, which was attended by the IG Balochistan and the chief secretary, the government announced that it would target individuals involved in anti-state propaganda and activism.According to ARY News, CM Bugti instructed all commissioners and district officers to act swiftly against any government employees suspected of promoting anti-state narratives or participating in activities that challenge the state's authority. The government's move appears to be a direct attempt to suppress activism and dissent within the province, especially among those critical of the state's policies. Bugti also confirmed that individuals involved in such actions would be placed under strict surveillance by being added to the Fourth Schedule for closer monitoring.ARY News also reported that CM Bugti directed all heads of educational institutions in the province to ensure the national flag is hoisted and the national anthem is recited regularly. Educational leaders who fail to enforce these directives are being told to resign, which signals a heightened crackdown on any form of resistance within these spaces.This renewed focus on stifling activism in Balochistan reflects the government's broader strategy to assert control over the region, including monitoring and potentially silencing any opposition to its policies.This comes amidst the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. Activists in the Balochistan region have frequently organised protests and campaigns, calling attention to the region's marginalisation.In response, governments have implemented harsh crackdowns, often leading to the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. These actions have sparked widespread criticism from international human rights organisations, highlighting concerns over the suppression of political expression and the stifling of peaceful advocacy for regional rights.","The Balochistan government has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities.

Arrests and political repercussions

Nepal's Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Monday accused former King Gyanendra Shah of attempting to disrupt social harmony and instigating violence during recent pro-monarchy protests . Addressing the House of Representatives, Oli said Shah was responsible for fueling unrest by aligning with individuals who refused to repay bank loans and encouraging division.""The alleged organisers attempted to drive a vehicle over the police and breached the restricted area. There were terrorist activities like setting fire to the international airport and the oil corporation's depot,"" Oli said.The protests, which took place in Kathmandu’s Tinkune area, turned violent, resulting in two deaths and over 110 injuries. Oli said that the protesters engaged in terrorist activities, including attempting to set fire to the international airport and oil corporation depot. He warned that those involved in arson, looting, and vandalism would not be spared.Oli alleged that Shah met protest leaders at Nirmal Niwas a day before the demonstration, raising suspicions about his involvement. He criticised the former king for failing to publicly clarify his stance on the unrest, adding that anyone seeking to reinstate monarchy must openly address these actions.The remarks led to strong opposition from lawmakers of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), which supports the restoration of the Hindu monarchy in Nepal. However, Oli remained firm, stating that those responsible for inciting violence would face legal consequences.Following the protests, Nepalese authorities detained over 100 pro-monarchy activists, including senior RPP leaders Rabindra Mishra and Dhawal Shamsher Rana. A Nepalese court extended the custody of 42 individuals for five days to allow further investigation.Police have charged 11 protesters with crimes against the state, while 31 others face organised crime-related charges.Among those arrested are key royalist figures, including Munindra Rajbhandari and Santosh, as well as RTF Commander Durga Prasai, who reportedly went into hiding after the protests. Authorities have vowed strict action against those found guilty of orchestrating the violence.The unrest comes amid renewed efforts by the RPP to push for the reinstatement of Nepal’s monarchy. The party, formed in the 1990s, has consistently supported the kingship and has seen fluctuating electoral success. In the 2022 elections, the RPP secured 14 parliamentary seats, marking a resurgence in its political influence.Nepal abolished its centuries-old monarchy in 2006 after King Gyanendra attempted to consolidate power. The transition to democracy, marked by widespread protests and international pressure, led to the establishment of a federal republic. However, the issue of monarchy remains divisive, with a significant portion of Nepal’s population still supporting a Hindu kingdom.","Nepal's Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli accused former King Gyanendra Shah of instigating violence during recent pro-monarchy protests. Oli claimed that Shah aligned with individuals refusing to repay loans, thereby fuelling social unrest. The protests, which took place in Kathmandu’s Tinkune area, turned violent, resulting in two deaths and over 110 injuries.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119812328,imgsize-1901605,width-400,resizemode-4/119812328.jpg"

Prince Harry-Meghan bullying case: What is going on between the Sussexes and charity chairwoman Sophie Chandauka?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/prince-harry-meghan-bullying-case-what-is-going-on-between-the-sussexes-and-charity-chairwoman-sophie-chandauka/articleshow/119807604.cms,"Meghan, Prince Harry and Sophie Chandauka.

Prince Harry 'bullying' allegations could damage future of charity he founded

'Prince Harry started to brief team against me'



'No one has courage to speak when the prince is in room'

The British monarchy has lasted not by standing still, but by knowing when to change. From the Glorious Revolution to the Netflix era, its survival has depended on the art of adaptation. But five years after breaking from the Firm, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle appear to be challenging that legacy—not by modernizing the crown, but by testing the patience of those closest to them. Once hailed as disruptors with a cause, the Sussexes now face growing criticism not just from palace insiders but from the very institutions they once claimed to uplift. The latest fallout: allegations of bullying and toxicity from inside Harry’s own charity.In another development landing a blow to already-troubled Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex,Sophie Chandauka, who chairs Sentebale, the charity Harry recently departed from, has appeared on British television accusing him of ""harassment and bullying at scale"" and stated their reputation had become ""toxic"".According to Chandauka, fundraising has declined since Megxit, with Harry being identified as the primary concern for Sentebale. She claimed that wealthy donors have withdrawn their support from his charity, citing Prince Harry's book publication of Spare.Speaking to Sky News, Chandauka said that the duchess had interrupted a charity polo event by arriving unexpectedly when the duke had already complicated matters by bringing a Netflix film crew to record his polo series that failed to deliver.""The duchess decided to attend, but she told us she wasn't attending, and she brought a friend, a very famous friend,"" Dr Chandauka said. ""The choreography went badly on stage because we had too many people on stage.""Cameras reportedly recorded uncomfortable moments when Meghan appeared to instruct Chandauka to move away from Harry, resulting in her awkwardly ducking beneath a polo trophy. Chandauka called it a 'bad day'.""The international press captured this, and there was a lot of talk about the duchess and the choreography on stage and whether she should have been there and her treatment of me,"" she added.When this unusual interaction gained attention online, the duke reportedly requested Chandauka to defend his wife - a request she declined.""I said I wouldn't. Not because I didn't care about the duchess, but because I knew what would happen if I did so, number one. And number two, because we cannot be an extension of the Sussexes,"" she said.Sentebale was set up by the prince in 2006 in memory of his mother, Princess Diana, to help young people with HIV in Lesotho and Botswana.Chandauka also accused Prince Harry of attempting to force her out of a charity established in memory of his mother, even suggesting he tried to cause the organization's failure when she refused to leave.""There were board meetings where members of the executive team and external strategic advisers were sending me messages saying, 'Should I interrupt?', 'Should I stop this?' 'Oh my gosh, this is so bad',"" she said.She revealed that the situation became so uncomfortable that strategic advisers withdrew from meetings. ""In fact, our strategic adviser for fundraising then sent me a message saying she wouldn't want to ever attend any more board meetings or bring her colleagues because of the treatment,"" she said.Dr Chandauka claimed Prince Harry attempted to undermine her position by speaking against her to sponsors. ""Prince Harry started to brief, and his team, sponsors that I had been speaking to, against me and the charity, because that is a sure way of getting me out if it's seen as though I'm not being successful in my fundraising efforts,"" she said.It has been almost five years since Megxit. On April 1, 2020, Harry and Meghan began a life without palace or official ties to the British Crown.Dr Chandauka accused Prince Harry of making additions to the board without consulting her.""Prince Harry decides, on this specific occasion, that he wants to appoint an individual to the board, with immediate effect, without having talked to me,"" she said.""His proxy on the board says, 'Yes, I second that motion'. The third proxy on the board says, 'Welcome to the board, Brian'.""And everybody's shocked and quiet, but this is what happens when the prince is in the room and no one has the courage to speak.""","Sophie Chandauka, who chairs Sentebale, the charity Harry recently departed from, has appeared on British television accusing him of ""harassment and bullying at scale"" She said fundraising has declined since Megxit, with Harry being identified as the primary concern. Chandaukas also accused Prince Harry of attempting to force her out of a charity established in memory of his mother.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119806028,imgsize-932293,width-400,resizemode-4/119806028.jpg"
