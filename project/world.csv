Poll Do you think the current approach towards Maoists reflects a fascistic mindset? Yes, it's oppressive. No, it's about maintaining order.

NEW DELHI: The CPI(M) on Thursday ""strongly condemned"" the encounter of 27 Maoists, including Nambala Kesavarao , in Chhattisgarh. In a statement, the CPI(M) Polit Bureau said repeated appeals from the Maoists for talks were ignored, and the Centre and the BJP-led Chhattisgarh government chose not to pursue a solution through dialogue.""Instead, they are following an inhuman policy of killings and annihilation. The statements made by the Union home minister, reiterating the deadline, and the chief minister of Chhattisgarh's statement that there is no need for talks reflect a fascistic mindset that appears to celebrate the taking of human lives and are against democracy,"" the CPI(M) said.Many political parties and concerned citizens have appealed to the government to consider the request for dialogue, the Left party said.""In spite of our opposition to Maoists' politics, we urge the government to immediately accept their request for talks and halt all paramilitary operations ,"" it added.CPI (Maoist) general secretary Nambala Keshav Rao alias Basavaraju was among 27 Maoists killed by security forces in Chhattisgarh on Wednesday. Union Home Minister Amit Shah called it a ""landmark achievement in the battle to eliminate Naxalism"".The CPI and the CPI(ML) Liberation have also condemned the encounter and demanded a judicial probe.The CPI said killing the Maoist leader ""instead of lawfully arresting him"" raised serious concerns about the State's commitment to democratic norms.","CPI(M) ""strongly condemned"" the encounter of 27 Maoists in Chhattisgarh.

HC took the position while faulting a trial court's move to frame rape charges against a man accused of rape by his partner of five years, reports Sanjeev Verma. HC held that such charges could not be formalised as the complainant woman had failed to adduce proof of the male partner having refused to marry her, especially when both had knowingly entered into a long-term physical relationship.The bench allowed the man's appeal against the decision of the fast-track trial court in Sirmaur's Nahan. HC noted that there was not a single clear averment in the complaint by the 30-year-old woman that the man had refused to marry her.The bench noticed that according to the complainant, the marriage was agreed upon in 2014 but put off several times till 2021 when there were alleged demands of dowry from the man's family.

In an interview in the Netherlands, Jaishankar said the fighting with Pakistan was halted after its army sent a message saying it's ready to stop firing, and India responded accordingly.The rejection of Trump's mediation claim for the first time at the political level followed repeated doubling down by Trump and his team that he brought the conflict to an end by forcing a ceasefire. Asked where the US was during the negotiations, EAM S Jaishankar said ""in the United States"", driving home his point that it wasn't American intervention that led to a pause.""They (vice-president Vance and secretary of state Marco Rubio) were talking to us and to Pakistanis as indeed were other countries. The US was not alone. When there is a conflict, it's natural for countries to call up and indicate their concerns..., but the cessation of firing was something negotiated directly between India and Pakistan. We told everybody that if Pakistanis want to stop firing, their general has to call us and say that.And that's what happened,"" Jaishankar said. He added that India is ready to discuss issue of terrorism with Pakistan and reiterated New Delhi's point on the Kashmir issue that it will only negotiate the return of POK to India.Jaishankar said Operation Sindoor continues because of its clear message that if there are more terror acts like Pahalgam, India will hit terrorists. ""If the terrorists are in Pakistan we will hit them where they are... So, there is a message in continuing the operation but continuing the operation is not the same as firing on each other,"" he said.On the religious profiling of Pahalgam attack victims, Jaishankar said, ""Pakistani leadership, especially their army chief, is driven by an extreme religious outlook... So, there is clearly some connect between the views that were expressed and the behaviour that was done.""Foreign secretary Vikram Misri, too, had earlier drawn a link between the religious profiling by terrorists and Pakistan army chief Asim Munir's anti-India speech on April 16 in which he had stressed the differences between Hindus and Muslims.The minister warned against falling for the narrative that Pakistan does not know what is going on. ""Most notorious terrorists on UN sanctions list are in Pakistan. They operate in big cities, in daylight. Their addresses are known. Their activities are known. Their mutual contacts are known.

The university has also issued show-cause notices to 20 other students in connection with the incident. The notices were issued on April 28.The disciplinary action follows a violent confrontation between two student groups on April 25 near the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Kaushal Kendra inside Gate Number 8 of the campus. According to the notices, what started as a brawl quickly escalated into large-scale violence, with students and outsiders allegedly using lathis, stones and other dangerous weapons to attack each other and disrupt peace on campus.One of the expulsion orders, addressed to a student from the diploma in civil engineering course, stated: ""The rioting groups pelted stones and bricks on each other near 'Hygenic Point' cafe... The mob shouted at the students, staff and visitors and used abusive language to inflict terror amongst them. When the security staff and university officials tried to intervene, the mob hurled abuses and used unparliamentary language and also physically assaulted some of the guards on duty.The notice further added that the rioting groups moved from the South Campus to the North Campus through Gate Number 7 and continued attacking students, staff and university property, including the central library. ""They continued their rampage for hours...put the lives of innocent students, staff, faculty members and visitors in danger...This large-scale violence and lawlessness disturbed the peaceful and tranquil environment of the campus and created panic and chaos. ..""""The violence also resulted in disturbance in the lab exams, central library functioning and classroom teachings which ultimately spoiled the academic and research environment of Jamia Millia Islamia,"" the notice stated.The six expelled students belong to different faculties, including the Faculty of Social Sciences, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, MBA and Yoga Studies.

Crossing the Rubicon: Why Op Sindoor is a turning point - and Pakistan has no playbook left,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-indias-new-normal-against-pakistan-pakistan-nuclear-blackmail-pahalgam-attack/articleshow/121343471.cms,"Why it matters: India declares strategic sovereignty

1. India has shattered the nuclear ceiling myth

Operation Sindoor demystifies the nuclear escalatory ladder and gives India a dominant perch in deterrence dynamics.

2. India now controls the escalation narrative

3. It establishes a precedent for pre-emptive punishment

“This is not a game of vengeance, but a new form of justice,” PM Modi said.

4. It sets a new model for narrative warfare

Modi’s dramatic visit to Adampur with S-400 systems in the backdrop was both theater and signal: India is not hiding; it’s owning the narrative.

Striking with precision-and restraint

The significance of Op Sindoor lies as much in what India did not do as in what it accomplished. Despite capability and provocation, Indian forces refrained from strikes in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa-regions fraught with internal dissent against the Pakistani state.

This decision denied Islamabad the opportunity to rally its fractious peripheries and helped keep the conflict confined to military and terror-linked targets.

This dual-track strategy-kinetic strikes coupled with psychological and informational warfare-signals the arrival of a matured Indian doctrine that understands escalation control and political signaling in equal measure.

Controlling the narrative

Unlike during Balakot, where India’s post-strike silence allowed misinformation to spread, this time New Delhi controlled the information war with surgical clarity. From photographic evidence to live briefings and satellite imagery, India shaped the global narrative. Pakistan’s disinformation campaigns found little traction.

A symbolic moment came when PM Modi landed at the Adampur airbase-previously claimed “destroyed” by Pakistani media-with intact S-400 systems in view. The image was defiance made visual, reinforcing India’s credibility both domestically and internationally.

Zoom in: A surgical strike across domains

India’s targeting methodology broke new ground. The list of hit sites-Bahawalpur, Muridke, Hizbul Mujahideen facilities in PoK-reads like a who’s who of anti-India terror infrastructure.

""We know who you are, where you are, and how to get you,” one senior official told TOI.

The planning was meticulous. Intelligence had narrowed down buildings within terror compounds to individual residences of top jihadi leaders. Ten members of Masood Azhar’s family died. Azhar narrowly escaped an Indian missile. This wasn’t a symbolic strike-it was personal, precise, and punishing.

India deployed loitering munitions-a class of stealth drones designed to evade radar and deliver pinpoint attacks. These drones exposed the vulnerabilities in Pakistan’s Chinese-built air defenses and took out strategic targets, including the HQ-9 system near Lahore.

Water as weapon

Operation Sindoor should be remembered not as a dogfight between airframes, nor as a stumble toward strategic instability. It was a calibrated use of force, intended to signal resolve, degrade terrorist infrastructure, and demonstrate capability – without crossing the line into broader war. In doing so, it has redefined the contours of India’s response toolkit. Dr Walter Ladwig in an article in RUSI

What’s next: Institutionalizing the 'new normal'

India’s Operation Sindoor did not just punish Pakistan for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack. It redrew the entire strategic map of South Asia. With carefully calibrated force and clear political resolve, India called Pakistan’s nuclear bluff-and shifted the regional balance of power decisively in its favour.What began as a swift retaliatory strike evolved into a wider campaign that expanded across air, cyber, naval, and informational domains. This wasn’t another Balakot or surgical strike. It was a meticulously orchestrated assertion of what Prime Minister Narendra Modi later described as “a new form of justice.”PM Modi’s declaration from Bikaner-""Ab toh Modi ki naso mein lahu nahi, garam sindoor beh raha hai""-wasn’t mere political theater. It was a warning: India’s era of strategic restraint is over.Operation Sindoor is not just a military success-it marks India’s formal entry into the league of nations that use calibrated military force as a standard policy tool to achieve national objectives. What’s revolutionary is not just the action, but the doctrine it now represents.For decades, Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal served as a protective umbrella under which it waged asymmetric warfare-sponsoring terror groups, destabilizing Kashmir, and evading conventional retaliation.That assumption no longer holds.Dr Walter Ladwig noted in his analysis for RUSI: “Operation Sindoor added a new approach to India’s strategic toolbox... calibrated force under the nuclear shadow.“By striking presumed nuclear infrastructure, including the Kirana Hills and Noor Khan Airbase, India called Islamabad’s bluff,” wrote Jyotishman Bhagawati in Asia Times.The traditional Indo-Pak cycle-attack, international outcry, de-escalation -now stands broken. India launched multi-day strikes, absorbed Pakistani retaliation, and still dictated the terms and timing of cessation.""We made one thing very clear... their general has to call up our general and say this. And that is what happened,"" said external affairs minister S Jaishankar on the ceasefire.This signals credibility, resolve, and strategic maturity-the three ingredients of sustainable deterrence.Operation Sindoor isn’t a one-off-it’s a doctrinal evolution that’s now baked into India’s response framework. The new threshold is clear: If a terror attack happens, India will hit back-with precision and at scale.Future adversaries-state or non-state-will now calculate costs differently, knowing Indian retaliation is not symbolic, but systematic and scalable.In the age of disinformation, Operation Sindoor shows that India has learned to fight and win the information war. By swiftly releasing satellite imagery, conducting transparent briefings, and openly debunking Pakistani propaganda (like the fake claim of Adampur airbase destruction), India seized the perception battlefield.In perhaps the boldest assertion of geo-strategic leverage, India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty-a pact that had survived wars and crises since 1960. Pakistan’s deepening water crisis means this act is not merely symbolic but potentially destabilizing. And it was done without triggering global condemnation.In a single move, India turned geography into a weapon, adding hydro-diplomacy to its arsenal of pressure tools.India’s message isn’t just about retaliation-it’s about sustained pressure across the spectrum.Military: All three services displayed unprecedented jointness. Navy warships patrolled off Karachi, signaling a willingness to broaden the theatre. Vice Admiral AN Pramod said the Navy ensured Pakistan’s air force stayed “bottled up” on the Makran coast.Cyber and informational: According to reports, India restored access to Baloch voices on social platforms, quietly empowering indigenous resistance to Islamabad’s control. No bombs were dropped in Balochistan or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa-avoiding giving Pakistan a unifying nationalist cause while exploiting its internal fault lines.Geo-economics: By putting the Indus Waters Treaty in “abeyance,” India introduced a powerful new lever of pressure. As Pakistan faces a deepening water crisis, this move could have long-term strategic ramifications without provoking international backlash.(With inputs from agencies)",The significance of Op Sindoor lies as much in what India did not do as in what it accomplished. India refrained from strikes in Balochistan and Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa-regions fraught with internal dissent against the Pakistani state. New Delhi controlled the information war with surgical clarity.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121344563,imgsize-459848,width-400,resizemode-4/121344563.jpg"

With inputs from agencies





In Greek myth, Icarus ignored the warnings. Armed with wings of wax and ambition, he soared toward the sun—only to plummet when the heat proved greater than the flight.In 2025, Elon Musk arrived in Washington as Trump’s Icarus. His wings weren’t feathered—they were algorithmic. His torch wasn’t divine—it was a chainsaw. And his goal wasn’t escape, but dominion: dismantle the federal bureaucracy, slash $2 trillion in waste, and bend Washington’s sluggish machinery to the tempo of Silicon Valley.But the laws of political gravity, like myth, remain unchanged. And just four months after landing with fanfare, Musk is exiting the capital—not as a conqueror, but as a case study.From the start, Musk styled himself less as a policymaker and more as a disruptor-in-chief. Leading the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), his mission was to drag federal agencies out of what he saw as a bloated malaise.His approach was rapid and aggressive. Musk and his DOGE team roamed the bureaucracy like a rogue consulting firm—demanding access, slashing budgets, implementing productivity mandates, and declaring war on “wokeness.”For a while, it worked. Headlines soared. MAGA influencers cheered.But within weeks, the backlash began.The breaking point came in March. Musk bypassed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to install a new IRS commissioner—an act that triggered one of the most dramatic hallway confrontations in recent White House memory.“F*** you! F*** you! F*** you!” Bessent shouted at Musk, loud enough for President Trump to hear. Their argument spilled through the West Wing, Musk needling Bessent’s financial record, Bessent refusing to back down.In the end, Bessent prevailed. Musk’s candidate lasted three days. The power struggle was over—and so, increasingly, was Musk’s influence.What followed was a slow-motion unraveling. Musk’s claims of saving trillions were quietly revised to $170 billion. Courts halted layoffs. Agencies reinstated programs. Cabinet secretaries pushed back on reforms they said would gut essential services.Trump’s tone shifted. After Musk theatrically wielded a chainsaw onstage, the president distanced himself: “We say the scalpel rather than the hatchet,” he posted.Inside government, civil servants ignored DOGE directives. “How many people were fired because they didn’t send in their three things a week or whatever the fuck it was?” one adviser asked rhetorically. “Everyone is ready to move on from this part of the administration.”The tipping point came at a closed-door Cabinet meeting. Musk, still riding high off his outsider bravado, walked into what turned out to be a coordinated revolt.Secretary of State Marco Rubio , still stung by DOGE’s gutting of USAID, pushed back. So did VA Secretary Doug Collins and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. Musk defended his pace and methods, citing the need to replace fired staff with better hires—but by then, the opposition had crystalised.Even Trump, sensing the tide, began cooling publicly. And with that, Musk’s centrality in the administration began to erode.Outside DC, Musk’s political instincts fared no better. In Wisconsin, he campaigned for a conservative state Supreme Court candidate, wearing a cheese hat and turning himself into the story.Democrats pounced. The liberal candidate won by ten points. The GOP stopped mentioning Musk. Fundraising emails that once name-checked him vanished. Even Trump’s Truth Social account, once brimming with Musk praise, went quiet.One Republican operative was blunt: “He polls terrible. People hate him.”Internally, Musk also clashed with the administration on policy. He pushed a zero-tariff trade model—at odds with Trump’s economic populism. He publicly insulted Peter Navarro. A proposed Pentagon briefing on China triggered backlash over conflicts of interest, forcing Trump to disavow any such meeting.Even Steve Bannon took notice. “The fever had been broken,” he texted. Musk, once seen as a strategic partner, had become a liability.Musk’s status as a “special government employee” always had a shelf life—130 working days. There was chatter about extending it. That chatter has since ended.His team, however, remains embedded. DOGE alumni now serve at the Departments of Energy and Interior. The White House insists the mission continues: “DOGE employees who onboarded at their respective agencies will continue to work with President Trump’s cabinet to make our government more efficient,” said press secretary Karoline Leavitt.But Musk’s personal imprint is fading. Even he seems ready to step back. “I think I’ve done enough,” he said at the Qatar Economic Forum.Some believe Musk’s impact, though messy, was not meaningless. “He got a few big nicks,” said Appian CEO Matt Calkins. “But we probably didn’t need the chain saw. We needed the chisel.”Others are more sceptical. “They haven’t added any value,” said Ayushi Roy of Harvard Kennedy School. “They’ve just been deleting things.”Even Musk’s much-hyped fraud detection in Social Security turned out to be a red herring. Payments to those flagged individuals had already been stopped—well before DOGE flagged the anomaly.At agencies like the FAA, where Musk’s cuts triggered operational delays, the recovery is still ongoing.Musk insists DOGE can survive him. “DOGE is a way of life,” he told reporters. “Like Buddhism.” Asked whether it needs him to function, he replied, “Is Buddha needed for Buddhism?”But myth has a way of catching up.Musk entered the capital like a force of nature—a billionaire disruptor poised to rewire the republic. He exits with some cost savings, a few loyalists, and a long list of agencies quietly reversing his reforms.The Icarus analogy remains irresistible—not because Musk fell, but because he thought he wouldn’t. In Washington, where survival depends less on vision and more on consensus, his greatest miscalculation wasn’t the budget—it was the belief that raw will could outfly process.And in the end, the wax melted. The wings failed. And the swamp, as always, remained.",Elon Musk arrived in Washington as Trump’s Icarus. Musk styled himself less as a policymaker and more as a disruptor-in-chief.

Instagram post of the Puri YouTuber

The Odisha Police have started an investigation into the alleged links between a Puri-based YouTuber and 'Pak spy' Jyoti Malhotra. On Saturday, May 17, Haryana Police arrested YouTuber Jyoti Malhotra on the charge of passing sensitive information to Pakistani intelligence operatives. Jyoti Malhotra runs a YouTube channel, Travel with JO. She is said to be in contact with an employee named Danish working at the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi. On May 13, India had expelled the Pakistani official for indulging in espionage.The Odisha Police did not disclose the identity of the Puri YouTuber for its investigation into the matter.A team of police personnel visited the Youtuber's residence in Puri for an investigation into the matter. According to Police, Jyoti Malhotra visited Puri in Odisha in September 2024 and came in contact with a woman who is also a YouTuber. The Puri SP Vinit Agrawa said that the Youtuber had also travelled to Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara in Pakistan recently. “We found that Jyoti Malhotra had visited Puri last year, and we are verifying the fact. Anything more can be shared after the verification,” Agrawal said.Asked whether the woman from Puri had shared intelligence inputs with Malhotra, Agrawal said, “The Haryana Police are investigating the matter and we are providing them the required assistance.” The police are also ""examining the objective"" of Malhotra's visit to Puri, and trying to find out ""where she stayed, whom she contacted and any possible suspicious activities"", the Puri SP said.In a social media post, Puri YouTuber wrote, “Jyoti was just a friend of mine, and I came in contact with her through YouTube. I was unaware of anything which she is accused of. I would not have been in touch with her if I knew she was spying for enemy Pakistan.” She added, “If any investigative agency wishes to cross-question, I would provide full cooperation. Nation is above all. Jai Hind.”The YouTuber has now made her Instagram account private, which means that only users she approves as followers can see the content on her Instagram page now.The Puri-based content creator does not have a huge following. She has 14,600 subscribers on YouTube and 20,000 followers on her Instagram account. The number is way less than that of Jyoti Malhotra.

A manifesto calling for armed demonstration as a response to the 'genocide' in Gaza surfaced online after 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez shot dead a young Israeli diplomat couple at the Capital Jewish Museum. It is believed that the manifesto belongs to Rodriguez, where he suggested that the murders of the diplomat couple were the only sane thing to do.Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim -- set to be engaged soon -- were leaving an event at the Capital Jewish Museum when the suspect approached a group of four people and opened fire in a major anti-semitic incident in DC.

It mentioned former soldier Aaron Bushell who set himself on fire outside the Israeli embassy in protest. The manifesto quoted the number of dead Palestinians, based on figures from the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, and suggested the total figure could be higher.“We who let this happen will never deserve the Palestinians’ forgiveness.They’re let us know as much,” the letter stated.“Inhumanity has long since shown itself to be shockingly common, mundane, prosaically human.

Haiti accused the Dominican Republic on Thursday of committing xenophobic acts and violating the rights of Haitian migrants, especially pregnant and nursing women, amid its growing deportation drive.The government of Dominican President Luis Abinader has stepped up deportations in recent months to Haiti, despite the nation's mounting insecurity from gang violence.Nearly 20,000 people were deported across the border in April, the UN said on Tuesday, including a ""rising number of pregnant and breastfeeding women.""It said UN and partner organizations had over the previous month ""assisted an average of 15 pregnant women and 15 breastfeeding mothers per day.""In a rare official response, Haiti's ministry of foreign affairs issued a statement noting broad mistreatment and saying its ambassador in the Dominican Republic would begin organizing voluntary repatriation convoys to bring citizens home ""in dignified conditions.""The ministry called for dialogue and called on civil society groups to enforce the rights of Haitians, wherever they may be.Many Haitians have fled poverty, political instability, and gang violence, which has worsened over the past year, particularly in the capital Port-au-Prince.Dominican officials have implemented a crackdown on foreigners since April 21, barring those without papers from staying in the country after receiving medical care.Since taking office in 2020 and his triumphant re-election in 2024, Abinader has toughened migration policies, and has launched the construction of a wall along his country's border with Haiti.Humanitarian organizations have voiced particular concern for the plight of pregnant women, with the UN on Tuesday denouncing the practice saying it's ""in violation of international standards.""","Dominican President Luis Abinader has stepped up deportations in recent months to Haiti.

Top 5 takeaways from the book:

1.

A first meeting with Donald Trump

Son Barron at the centre of hurtful speculation

Backing Trump’s claims about the 2020 election

Watching an assassination attempt live on TV

A rare pro-choice stance from a Republican first lady





Melania Trump is using artificial intelligence to tell her story, releasing an AI-narrated version of her memoir Melania in her own voice.The 7-hour audiobook marks a first for the US first lady. The book, initially published in October 2024, covers her personal life, political stances, and controversial moments. It includes her reflections on motherhood, marriage to Donald Trump, and her views on key issues like abortion and election integrity.The AI voice was developed under her direct supervision. While she embraces AI in this context, she has criticised its misuse in harmful digital content, particularly deepfake pornography. According to People's magazine, the audiobook is currently available only in English, with more languages to follow in late 2025.Melania in her book, recounts meeting Donald Trump at a New York club in 1988. She declined to give him her number but took his instead, later calling and going on a first date at his Seven Springs estate. She describes his charm and energy as “magnetic”.2.Melania shares her pain over rumours that her son, Barron, was autistic. She criticises comedian Rosie O’Donnell’s post suggesting this, calling it cruel and baseless. The episode, she says, inspired her anti-bullying “Be best” campaign.3.While using softer language than her husband, Melania casts doubt on the 2020 US election, questioning the extended vote count due to mail-in ballots. She explains her silence on the Capitol riot as being unaware of the situation as it happened.4.Melania describes the fear and chaos of witnessing an attempt on Donald Trump’s life during a rally, which she watched from New Jersey. She says she was most concerned about their son, who also saw the footage and was deeply affected.5.Melania makes a strong case for abortion rights in her book, saying that women must have autonomy over their bodies. Her statement drew criticism from conservative groups but was supported by her husband, who said she should share her beliefs honestly.","The 7-hour audiobook marks a first for the US first lady.

North Korea vows to arrest those responsible for failed ship launch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-vows-to-arrest-those-responsible-for-failed-ship-launch/articleshow/121351142.cms,"Kim Jong Un (File Photo AP)





SEOUL: North Korea said Friday it began steps to arrest and investigate those responsible for the failed launch of its second naval destroyer after leader Kim Jong Un expressed fury over the incident that he said was caused by criminal negligence. The 5,000-ton-class warship was damaged when a transport cradle on the ship's stern detached early during a launch ceremony at the northeastern port of Chongjin on Wednesday, state media said. Satellite imagery on the site showed the vessel lying on its side, with most of its hull submerged and draped in blue covers.North Korea's official Korean central news agency said Friday that the severity of the damage was ""not serious"" and could be repaired in about 10 days. It said the hull on the starboard side was scratched and some seawater had flowed into the stern section, though it denied an earlier assessment that the bottom of the hull had been left with holes.The extremely secretive nature of North Korea makes it almost impossible to verify the assessment. North Korea has a history of manipulating or covering up military-related setbacks, policy fiascoes and other mishaps, though it has periodically acknowledged some of such events in recent years.Observers believe North Korea's admission of the failed launch was likely meant to show Kim's resolve to advance his naval capabilities and boost discipline.The North's central military commission summoned Hong Kil Ho, manager of the Chongjin shipyard, as it begun its investigation of the failed launch, KCNA reported.""No matter how good the state of the warship is, the fact that the accident is an unpardonable criminal act remains unchanged, and those responsible for it can never evade their responsibility for the crime,"" the commission said, according to KCNA.Kim, who was present at the failed launch, had blamed military officials, scientists and shipyard operators and ordered that the warship be repaired before a high-level ruling Workers' Party meeting in late June.The damaged ship is assessed as the same class as North Korea's first destroyer, unveiled last month with great fanfare and said to be capable of carrying various weapons including nuclear missiles. Analysts say it is the North's biggest and most advanced warship to date and was likely built with Russian assistance.The North Korea-focused 38 North website had assessed last week that North Korea was preparing to launch the destroyer in Chongjin with a method it has rarely used. The report said the ship was being prepared to be launched sideways from the quay, while the previous destroyer launched at the western shipyard of Nampo used a floating dry dock.","North Korea begins steps to arrest and investigate those responsible for the failed launch of its second naval destroyer.

A 22-year-old Indian-origin tech student, Akash Banerjee, was shot in the head in the apartment he used to stay in near the Georgia Tech campus. This incident took place on May 18 and now the Georgia Police have released surveillance footage claiming that it was a targeted act, and they have the suspect's photo from the surveillance footage.The accused was looking for Banerjee, who has a criminal history, the police said without elaborating on what type of criminal past Banerjee had.In a press conference yesterday, the Atlanta Police Department said the student was identified as Akash Banerjee by the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office. He was shot in the head on the ninth floor of The Connector student apartments in posh Midtown. He was taken to Grady Hospital, where he died on Tuesday.“We’re at a point where we believe this was a targeted act,” APD Homicide Commander Andrew Smith said during the press conference, Fox5Atlanta reported.The department released a surveillance video in which the suspect was seen walking down the hallway with what seems like a gun protruding from his pocket -- 10 minutes before the shooting. Andrew Smith confirmed that the alleged shooter had been to be building previously looking for Banerjee.Banerjee's building has key card access without which nobody can enter, and it's to be investigated how the shooter got one. Police said there was an altercation between the two, following which Banerjee was shot.The shooter has not been named but identified as a person of interest. “He was in the hallway well before the victim arrived,” Smith said, “which is why we believe the victim was targeted.”A person who lives in the same building called 911 and reported hearing a loud noise and seeing someone lying on the floor outside their door.""There is someone in front of my door who is lying on the floor, and we heard a loud noise,"" the caller told the dispatcher. ""I don’t know if he’s dead, but I don’t want to open the door. I don’t want to get in trouble. I don’t know what happened.""Police said they have reasons to believe that Banerjee knew the shooter but they are yet to find out the connection between them.“We are deeply saddened by the passing of one of our students. This loss is felt across our community, and our hearts go out to the student’s family, friends and loved ones. We extend our heartfelt thanks to the medical professionals who provided such dedicated care,” Georgia Tech School said in a statement.","Akash Banerjee, a 22-year-old Indian-origin tech student, was shot in the head in the apartment he used to stay in near the Georgia Tech campus.

Judge blocks ICE from revoking international students' legal status,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-blocks-ice-from-revoking-international-students-legal-status/articleshow/121351044.cms,"



SAN FRANCISCO: A judge in California blocked the Trump administration Thursday from terminating the legal status of international students nationwide while a court case challenging previous terminations is pending.The order by US district judge Jeffrey S White in Oakland bars the govt from arresting, incarcerating or moving students elsewhere based on their legal status until the case is resolved. Students could still be arrested for other reasons and their legal status can still be revoked if they are convicted of a violent crime carrying a prison term of more than a year.Most courts hearing these types of cases have granted protections to the person suing, but White said the govt's actions ""wreaked havoc"" not only on the lives of plaintiffs but other nonimmigrants in the US on student visas.White, who was nominated by President George W Bush, a Republican, issued the nationwide injunction sought by attorneys for about two dozen students who sued after their legal status was abruptly terminated in early April by ICE.More than 4,700 international students had their permission to study in the US cancelled this spring, with little notice or explanation, as part of President Trump's crackdown on immigrants and foreign nationals. In court hearings, DHS officials said they ran the names of student visa holders through an FBI-run database that contains the names of suspects who have been arrested.","A judge in California blocked the Trump administration Thursday from terminating the legal status of international students nationwide.

Harvard 'Sets Example' By Defying Trump, Accepts $2.3 Bn Funding Freeze | Big Fight Explained





The Trump administration has stripped Harvard University of its ability to enroll international students. The decision, announced by homeland security secretary Kristi Noem , targets one of the world’s most prestigious universities and puts nearly 6,800 foreign students-over a quarter of Harvard’s enrollment—at risk of losing their legal status in the United States.The administration’s action is part of a broader political and ideological conflict between President Donald Trump and elite US institutions that his administration accuses of promoting antisemitism, harboring pro-Hamas sympathies, and enforcing discriminatory diversity policies. Harvard, in turn, has called the action “unlawful” and a serious threat to its academic and research mission, warning that it undermines not only the institution but also the US higher education system as a whole.The administration revoked Harvard's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), which means “Harvard can no longer enroll foreign students and existing foreign students must transfer or lose their legal status,” according to Homeland Security.According to homeland security Secretary Kristi Noem, Harvard failed to provide requested records about its foreign students.Noem stated the university was “perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies and employs racist ‘diversity, equity and inclusion’ policies.”Students who are graduating this semester may do so, but those who haven’t completed their degrees “need to transfer to another university,” or they risk losing their legal right to remain in the US, according to the government.Yes. Noem said Harvard could restore its SEVP certification if it complies within 72 hours by producing extensive documentation. The demands include “disciplinary records for international students, plus any audio and video recordings of protest activity.”Yes. Harvard has called the move “unlawful” and said it “undermines Harvard’s academic and research mission.” The university added it is “working to provide guidance to affected students.”No, experts say this is highly unusual. “I've never seen it revoked for any reason besides the administrative issues listed in the statute,” said Sarah Spreitzer of the American Council on Education. “This is unprecedented.”Yes. This escalation follows earlier moves by the Trump administration to defund Harvard’s research, freeze $3 billion in grants, and publicly criticize the university’s leadership. Noem stated, “This should be a warning to every other university to get your act together.”There is widespread uncertainty and fear. One student told AFP, “Everyone’s panicking a bit.” Another said, “It’s scary and it’s saddening... getting into the school has been the greatest privilege of my life.”What legal authority does the government have in this matter?The Department of Homeland Security has the authority to certify or decertify universities under SEVP. Institutions must meet certain legal and operational standards, and “it is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students,” Noem emphasized.Noem warned this could happen to others. “Absolutely, we are” considering similar actions at other institutions, she said, citing Columbia University as a possible next target.International students contribute significantly to tuition revenue. The administration has also cut billions in federal research grants. One analyst called the latest action “just another financial hit on top of several hits that have already come for big research universities.”Critics argue it’s a politically motivated overreach. Ted Mitchell of the American Council on Education called it an “illegal, small-minded” decision. A Harvard student group said, “Trump's attack on international students is textbook authoritarianism.”Harvard has already filed lawsuits over previous actions. Legal experts expect this latest move could also face court challenges, and federal judges have recently ruled that changes to student visa status must follow proper procedures.","The Trump administration has stripped Harvard University of its ability to enroll international students.

The legal arguments

(With AP inputs)





Detained pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil on Thursday held his one-month-old son for the first time, after a US federal judge overruled the Donald Trump administration's efforts to keep the father and the infant separated by a plexiglass barrier.New Jersey federal judge Michael Farbiarz issued an order allowing Khalil a ""contact visit"" by his wife, US national Noor Abdalla, and their son Deen. The Wednesday night order came after federal officials said they would oppose his legal effort to secure the contact visit .Abdalla's visit came ahead of a scheduled immigration hearing for her spouse, a legal permanent resident who has been detained in a Louisiana jail since March 8.Khalil was the first person arrested under President Donald Trump's promised crackdown on pro-Palestinian protesters. Previously, the US Customs and Immigration Department (ICE) had declined the Columbia University graduate's request to attend the birth of his child. Deen was born on April 21.Authorities have not accused Khalil of a crime, but they have sought to deport him on the basis that his ""prominent role"" in protests against Israel's war in Gaza may have ""undermined"" US foreign policy interests.The US Department of Justice (DoJ) argued that granting a family visitation to Khalil would ""effectively grant him a privilege no other detainee receives.""""Allowing Dr. Abdalla and a newborn to attend a legal meeting would turn a legal visitation into a family one,"" DoJ officials wrote in a court filing.Brian Acuna, acting director of the ICE field office in New Orleans, noted in an accompanying affidavit that it would be ""unsafe"" to allow Abdalla, a Michigan-born dentist, and the baby into a secured part of the facility.In their own legal filings, Khalil's attorneys described the government's refusal to grant the visit as ""further evidence of the retaliatory motive behind Mr. Khalil's arrest and faraway detention,"" adding that his wife and child were ""the farthest thing from a security risk.""They noted that Abdalla had travelled nearly 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) to the remote detention centre in Jena, Louisiana, in hopes of introducing their son to his father.",Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil held his one-month-old son for the first time. A US federal judge overruled the Donald Trump administration's efforts to keep the father and the infant separated by a plexiglass barrier.

Alaska's largest city has reached a USD 2.1 million settlement with the family of a 16-year-old girl who was holding a knife last August when she was fatally shot by a police officer. Anchorage Mayor Suzanne LaFrance's office said in a statement Thursday the settlement followed a meeting between police chief Sean Case and members of Easter Leafa's family. Terms of the agreement were not released.An attorney for the family, Darryl Thompson, confirmed the settlement amount announced by the city.""The Leafa family was devastated by the loss of young Easter Sally.

""They have handled their loss with dignity and grace and are grateful that this phase of the healing is behind them.""State prosecutors last fall announced they would not file criminal charges against the officer who fatally shot Leafa, concluding that the use of deadly force was legally justified.Officers had responded to a call for help placed by one of Leafa's sisters, who said Leafa was ""trying to stab her with a knife"" because she had not done what Leafa wanted, according to a report on the findings released by the state Office of Special Prosecutions.The report determined the officer ""reasonably believed"" he or another officer was about to be assaulted by the girl.The sister later told investigators ""she knew that Easter Leafa was trying to give the knife to the officers,"" the report said.Leafa was one of seven people shot by police in Anchorage in a roughly three-month span last year. She had recently moved from American Samoa and was still learning English, her family has said.""We want to protect everyone involved from having to re-live this incident in court,"" LaFrance said.

Trump's Harvard visa threat could wipe out several of the school's sports teams,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-harvard-visa-threat-could-wipe-out-several-of-the-schools-sports-teams/articleshow/121349438.cms,"Photo: AP





CAMBRIDGE: - Some of Harvard's sports teams would be virtually wiped out by a Trump administration decision announced on Thursday that would make the Ivy League school with the nation's largest athletic program ineligible for international student visas.Seven of the eight rowers on the men's heavyweight crew team that just won the Eastern Sprints title - and is headed to the national championships - list international hometowns on the school's website. Mick Thompson, the leading scorer last season, and Jack Bar, who was a captain, are among a handful of Canadians on the men's hockey roster; 10 of the 13 members of the men's squash team and more than half of the women's soccer and golf rosters also list foreign hometowns.Harvard's 42 varsity sports teams are the most in the nation, and Sportico reported last month that 21% of the players on the school's rosters for the 2024-25 seasons - or 196 out of 919 athletes - had international hometowns. The site noted that some could be U.S. citizens or green card holders who wouldn't need one of the international visas at issue in an escalating fight premised by the administration's assertions that the school failed to protect Jewish students from antisemitism.The Department of Homeland Security on Thursday revoked Harvard's ability to enroll international students, saying the school has created an unsafe campus environment by allowing ""anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators"" to assault Jewish students on campus. The move could force as many as 6,800 foreign students at the school outside of Boston - more than a quarter of its total enrollment - to transfer or leave the country.Harvard called the action unlawful and said it is working to provide guidance to students. President Alan Garber, noting that he is himself Jewish, said last month after filing a lawsuit to halt a federal funding freeze that the school ""will continue to fight hate with the urgency it demands as we fully comply with our obligations under the law. That is not only our legal responsibility. It is our moral imperative.""Harvard athletic director Erin McDermott previously declined an interview request from The Associated Press on the potential impact of the visa ban. A Harvard athletics spokesman on Thursday referred a request for comment to the school's main media information office, which did not immediately respond. The AP also requested comment from three Harvard coaches, who did not respond.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, a former Harvard hockey player, declined to comment when contacted by the AP. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, a Democrat who played basketball at Harvard, said the athletes are among 85,000 foreign students who come to the state to ""study, conduct research, start businesses, and create jobs and innovations.""""President Trump is punishing our students and hurting our economy, all as part of his agenda to silence anyone who disagrees with him,"" she said. ""The only ones who benefit from Donald Trump's actions are China and other countries who are already recruiting these students.

The White House confirmed on Thursday that a flight with eight immigrants left Texas this week, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt lashing out at a federal judge who held that the Donald Trump administration was in violation of his earlier injunction.US District Court judge Brian Murphy had barred the federal government from sending immigrants to countries other than their own.The flight, which the deportees' lawyers claimed was headed for South Sudan in Africa, will now remain in the east African country of Djibouti for two weeks to comply with a court order, Leavitt said.Those onboard are from Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cuba, Mexico, and South Sudan.Leavitt alleged that judge's order was an attempt to “bring these monsters back to our country.”“Now Judge Murphy is forcing federal officials to remain in Djibouti for over two weeks threatening our US diplomatic relationships with countries around the world and putting the agents’ lives in danger by having to be with these illegal murderers, criminals and rapists,” NBC News quoted the White House press secretary as saying during a media briefing.""The order is a massive judicial overreach. He cannot control the foreign policy or the national security of the United States of America, and to suggest otherwise is being completely absurd,"" she added.During Wednesday's hearing, Murphy also ordered that the deported individuals be provided legal counsel and an opportunity to raise their fears.Additionally, he directed that the eight individuals be given at least 15 days to reopen immigration proceedings and challenge their deportation if the federal government still aims to send them to a third country.""Without sufficient time to consult an attorney or family members, it was impossible for the immigrants to challenge their deportations to a third country. The actions of the department (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) are unquestionably violative of this court’s order,"" the judge stated.","The White House confirmed Thursday that a flight with eight immigrants left Texas this week.

Harvard barred from enrolling international students,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harvard-barred-from-enrolling-international-students/articleshow/121348229.cms,"Trump admin bars Harvard's ability to enroll international students





In a major escalation in the Trump administration's efforts to pressure Harvard to fall in line with the president's agenda, the US department of homeland security has revoked the university's ability to enrol international students, and existing foreign students must transfer or lose their legal status. Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem ordered the department to terminate Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification.""This administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,"" Noem said.The Trump administration Thursday halted Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, taking aim at a crucial funding source for the nation's oldest and wealthiest college in a major escalation in the administration's efforts to pressure the elite school to fall in line with the president's agenda.The administration notified Harvard about the decision after a back-and-forth in recent days over the legality of a sprawling records request as part of the department of homeland security's (DHS) investigation, according to three people with knowledge of the negotiations. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly.The latest move is likely to prompt a second legal challenge from Harvard, according to another person familiar with the school's thinking who insisted on anonymity to discuss private deliberations.The university sued the administration last month over govt's attempt to impose changes to its curriculum, admissions policies and hiring practices.""I am writing to inform you that effective immediately, Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification is revoked,"" according to a letter sent to the university by Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary. A copy of the letter was obtained by The New York Times.Harvard called the action illegal. The move comes after Harvard refused to provide information Noem had previously demanded about some foreign student visa holders who attend the university, the department said. ""This administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,"" Noem said. ""It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments. """"The govt's action is unlawful. We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the university - and this nation - immeasurably,"" the university said in as statement."" About 6,800 international students attended Harvard this year, or roughly 27%of the student body, according to university enrollment data. That was up from 19.7 % in 2010.The move is likely to have a significant effect on the university's bottom line. Tuition at Harvard is $59,320 for the school year that begins later this year, and costs can rise to nearly $87,000 when room and board are included. International students tend to pay larger shares of education costs compared with other students.Noem posted the letter on social media later on Thursday. In a news release confirming the administration's move, the DHS sent a stark message to Harvard's international students: ""This means Harvard can no longer enroll foreign students, and existing foreign students must transfer or lose their legal status.""The move marks a significant escalation of Trump govt's campaign against the elite Ivy League university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which has emerged as one of Trump's most prominent institutional targets.","The move is likely to prompt a second legal challenge from Harvard, according to another person familiar with the school's thinking.

Why Pakistan promoted Asim Munir after Operation Sindoor humiliation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/why-pakistan-promoted-asim-munir-after-operation-sindoor-humiliation/articleshow/121348105.cms,"



When Pakistan bestowed the honorary rank of field marshal on its army chief Asim Munir , it may have come as a surprise to many who thought Pakistan had finally been delivered a kick in the guts by Operation Sindoor for its relentless use of cross-border terrorism against India. However, to others who have followed the commentary in Pakistani media and noticed how a nationalistic frenzy has been whipped up in the country since May 10 --- the day President Donald Trump waded into the conflict, claiming he had brokered a ceasefire - it was only to be expected.Aware of the pitfalls of any military humiliation at the hands of India, the army and the civilian establishment have continued to circle the wagons against any possible criticism of the reverses suffered from Indian action. This move to honour Munir with a military rank inherited from the British for extraordinary service in wartime is a part of the same exercise to keep up the pretence of a victory over India.Former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan G Parthasarathy says Munir's promotion is the brainwave of an army chief who nurses pathological hatred for India and whose operation against India ended in a fiasco. ""This entire episode of attack on India reveals yet again that while other countries have an army, in Pakistan the army has a country,"" he said.Munir is only the second army chief in Pakistan's history to be named field marshal after Ayub Khan, who had declared himself one after the 1958 military coup. A lackey civilian establishment needed little prodding to confer the 'five-star' rank on the chief of army staff. Unlike Khan, who became president, Munir will continue to serve as the army chief.There's little doubt, at least in Pakistan's imagination, that Munir has emerged stronger from the crisis. He has been feted by a vast majority of the Pakistani people and the media for standing up to India till help arrived in the form of the ceasefire that Trump claimed to have negotiated, something India claims is not true. That is also the reason why Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif has sought to claim credit for Munir's promotion, saying it was his decision alone to elevate him to the rank of field marshal.Another former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan, Sharat Sabharwal, says the decision to honour Munir for what Islamabad described as his ""high strategy and courageous leadership"" against India reflects the hold that he enjoys on power now as a result of the recent military exchanges with India.""It shows that the national sentiment is consolidated around the army,"" says Sabharwal, adding that his main powers will continue to be drawn from his position as the chief of army staff.Munir may have consolidated his position for now but no amount of obfuscation or the spin Pakistan gave to the events of May 10 will help him or Shehbaz wish away the complex web of internal and external challenges Pakistan is faced with. A fragile economy, unsuccessful counter-insurgency operations against groups like Pakistan Taliban and Balochistan Liberation Army, collapse of ties with Afghanistan, fuelling of political instability by the army with the ousting of Imran Khan and rift within the army - one of the reasons why Munir perhaps provoked the conflict with India - will likely prove a tough row to hoe even for the resurgent army chief.Munir will also know that the global community now has little patience left for Pakistan's 'good terrorist-bad terrorist' tool kit, and efforts to play on the fears in the West of a nuclear conflict with India may not find much traction. Also, while China has welcomed the ceasefire, it's unlikely to be pleased with the way Pakistan sought US intervention to end the conflict with India and later lauded Trump's role.On top of all that, Munir now also has to contend with what India calls the new normal - Indian armed forces will actively seek out and eliminate terrorists, who target India, in both POK and the mainland, without giving in to any nuclear blackmail or global outcry. Munir will know that if he decides to walk up to the brink, India will be happy to give him company.India effectively holds Munir responsible for the Pahalgam attack, as evident from the link foreign secretary Vikram Misri drew between the religious profiling of the victims and his April 16 speech, in which the jihadi general - a sobriquet he earned for his religious zealotry - stressed the two-nation theory and ""stark differences between Hindus and Muslims"". In candidness, and deep-seated antipathy for India, Munir's remarks were next only to comments by one of his illustrious predecessors, General Pervez Musharraf, who, in 1999, said that Pakistan would continue to wage a low-intensity conflict with India even if the Kashmir issue was resolved. That perhaps explains why Pakistan has continued to use terrorism as an instrument of policy against India and the improbability of any change even if a serious attempt is made to resolve outstanding issues.As Sabharwal says, Munir is a hardliner on India and the Indian govt will closely follow how strong his hold on power remains. With a pliable govt in place, Munir is already the de facto ruler of the country but that he may be priming himself for a bigger role - like following in Musharraf's steps - is not ruled out. The challenge for India will be to keep the focus internationally on cross-border terrorism as that's the surest way of blunting Pakistan's military-nuclear narrative that the West has a tendency of buying into.","Munir is only the second army chief in Pakistan's history to be named field marshal after Ayub Khan, who had declared himself one after the 1958 military coup.

A promotion after defeat: What's behind Asim Munir's Field Marshal gambit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/field-marshal-asim-munir-pakistan-army-chief-operation-sindoor-india-and-pakistan/articleshow/121319156.cms,"Asim Munir’s grip on power may look firm, but it’s anything but secure.

Promotion or protection?

Officially, the move is being framed as a recognition of ""strategic brilliance."" PM Sharif praised Munir’s ""decisive defeat of the enemy,"" asserting that under his leadership, the military ""staunchly defended Pakistan’s sovereignty."" Munir himself called the promotion ""an honour for the armed forces and the nation.""

But few outside Pakistan’s tightly controlled media landscape are buying it.

""Field Marshal rank is usually conferred after a military victory,"" Tilak Devasher, a seasoned Pakistan watcher, told the Economic Times. ""This may be the first time it has been awarded after a defeat-it seems intended to mask that defeat.""

The timing is hard to ignore. Pakistan’s public is still reeling from the fallout of the India strikes, and internal dissent within the army is reportedly rising.

A widely circulated letter from a group calling itself ""The Guardians of Honour"" accused Munir of corruption and military incompetence. The letter reflects what some analysts say is quiet but growing discontent within senior ranks.

A shield against scrutiny

All ceremony, no strategy

The big picture: The war at home

Munir’s rise comes at a fragile moment for Pakistan. The ceasefire with India has held for now. But underneath the diplomatic calm lies a volatile domestic landscape:

Security turmoil: Over 3,700 terror incidents have claimed nearly 3,900 lives in the past 17 months, according to ISPR figures-pointing to a deteriorating internal security climate, especially in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

With rising inflation, IMF-dependency, and India's suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan's economy teeters on the edge. The military’s growing political role is being scrutinized for exacerbating the instability. Observers note that Munir is not merely defending national borders-he is navigating a labyrinth of domestic vulnerabilities that could unravel his authority.

His use of the two-nation theory and religious rhetoric to frame the India conflict was seen by critics as an attempt to rally the nation behind him. But the strategy may have backfired. ""Instead of unifying the nation, the gambit drew attention to Pakistan’s widening fractures,"" write analysts Ashok Behuria and Uttam Sinha in a joint commentary in the TOI.

The ghost of Imran Khan

What’s next

Munir’s elevation to Field Marshal is not about military strategy-it’s about political survival. It’s about shoring up a fractured command structure, muffling dissent, and projecting strength in the face of growing weakness.

Though the promotion may temporarily strengthen Munir’s position, it doesn’t erase the challenges ahead:

Internal threats persist, from Baloch separatists to the resurgent Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan.

PTI's political comeback looms, with Khan’s moral leverage growing even from prison.

Civil-military tension could intensify, especially if the rank is seen as an attempt to silence dissent or circumvent institutional checks.

There’s also talk of Munir eventually transitioning into a political role-possibly even as president. Ayub Khan set the precedent. In Pakistan’s fragile democracy, few would be surprised if history rhymed again.





In a move steeped more in symbolism than substance, Pakistan’s powerful army chief General Asim Munir has been elevated to the rarefied rank of Field Marshal . The announcement, made on Tuesday by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet, marks the first such promotion in over six decades. Only one other man-military dictator Ayub Khan in 1959-has held the title.But unlike Ayub, who awarded himself the rank amid consolidating his political power, Munir’s elevation comes on the heels of a military debacle. A bruising exchange with India, following a deadly attack in Pahalgam, resulted in India striking at least nine Pakistani air bases. The damage, while officially downplayed in Pakistan, left Munir politically exposed.So why the promotion? And why now?In a country where generals often enjoy impunity, the Field Marshal title may serve more as legal and political armor than as a mark of distinction. Some analysts see the promotion as a pre-emptive move to insulate Munir from possible court martial or early retirement, the ET report said.Legal experts point out that the Pakistani constitution makes no mention of the rank.Nor does the Pakistan Army Act. Instead, the promotion was reportedly made under Rule 199A of the Army Regulations (1998), which states that a general may be promoted to Field Marshal ""without regard to seniority or any specific appointment.""In essence, the move raises Munir above the military’s existing command structure-and, potentially, above accountability.Though technically ceremonial, the rank carries potent political meaning. In Pakistan’s civil-military power dynamic, optics often matter more than operational command.""Munir is now very much in the driving seat as the pivot of the power structure,"" said Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, former chair of the Senate defense committee. ""Given the weakness and divisions amongst the civilian politicians... all the mainstream political forces were convinced that the road to Islamabad lies through Rawalpindi.""That reality is reflected in the government’s simultaneous decision to extend the term of air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu-his second extension. Sidhu was credited with executing Operation Bunyanun Marsoos, Pakistan’s retaliatory air campaign against India's Operation Sindoor Still, in a tightly managed information environment, the military’s version of events prevails. State media declared a historic victory. Social media was flooded with hashtags like #PakistanStandsUnited. Meanwhile, dissenting voices-journalists, analysts, even former officers-vanished from screens.Munir’s political calculus also includes a rising challenge from behind bars: Former Prime Minister Imran Khan. His PTI party has labeled Munir a ""warmonger and coward,"" accusing him of dragging Pakistan into war to consolidate power. Khan’s moral authority, paradoxically strengthened by his imprisonment, continues to mobilize his base.Sharif’s civilian government, already seen as beholden to the military, risks further erosion of legitimacy. As one viral meme put it: ""War fought by Airforce. Army Chief promoted. Army’s only contribution-taking videos of tanks and hiding in bunkers.""(With inputs from agencies)","Pakistan's powerful army chief Asim Munir has been elevated to the rank of Field Marshal.

Pakistan Supreme Court upholds death penalty in beheading case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-supreme-court-upholds-death-penalty-in-beheading-case/articleshow/121300483.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Tuesday upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer , convicted of the gruesome 2021 murder of Noor Mukadam, the 27-year-old daughter of a former Pakistani diplomat.The decision, delivered by a three-member bench led by Justice Hashim Kakar, reaffirmed the judiciary’s stance on a case that has gripped the nation and exposed deep-seated issues of gender violence and privilege in Pakistan’s elite circles. The ruling, however, also raises questions about the consistency of justice in a country where systemic inequalities often shield the powerful.The case, one of the most high-profile in Pakistan’s recent history, stems from the horrific events of July 20, 2021, when Noor Mukadam was found tortured and beheaded at Jaffer’s residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4.Jaffer, a Pakistani-American and son of a wealthy industrialist, was arrested at the scene, covered in blood. Investigations revealed that Mukadam, a childhood acquaintance, was held hostage for two days, tortured with a knuckleduster, raped, and ultimately decapitated after allegedly rejecting Jaffer’s marriage proposal. The brutality of the crime, coupled with the elite status of both the victim and the perpetrator, sparked nationwide outrage and reignited debates over violence against women in Pakistan.The apex court’s verdict dismissed Jaffer’s appeal, which claimed “erroneous appreciation” of evidence and questioned the fairness of the trial due to media influence. The court upheld the death penalty for murder but converted Jaffer’s second death sentence for rape to life imprisonment, citing legal considerations.“This is not just my daughter’s case; it is a case for all the daughters of Pakistan,” said Shaukat Mukadam, Noor’s father. The ruling has been hailed by many as a victory for accountability, with social media posts on X reflecting public relief: “I hope Noor’s parents will sleep a little better tonight,” wrote one user, while another called it a “win for humanity.” Yet, the decision also exposes uncomfortable truths about Pakistan’s legal and social landscape.Critics argue that the case’s prominence owes much to the victim’s elite background, highlighting a stark disparity in how justice is pursued. “Mukadam’s status as a diplomat’s daughter shone a spotlight on her murder,” said women’s rights activist Tahira Abdullah, noting that countless similar cases involving less privileged women rarely garner such attention or swift judicial action. Pakistan ranks 153 out of 156 countries in the World Economic Forum’s 2021 gender gap index, and domestic violence remains a pervasive issue, with 28% of women aged 15-49 reporting physical violence, according to the ministry of human rights.","The Supreme Court of Pakistan upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer.
