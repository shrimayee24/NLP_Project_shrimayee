""Concerns of students will be addressed with fairness and equity. The counselling process will be underway soon and it is of utmost importance to move ahead without any confusion,"" he said.Govt sources clarified that the FIR related to NEET in Patna concerned ""solver gangs"" rather than a paper leak as claimed by Congress. Also, sources in NTA said the average score of qualifiers in Bihar was lower than the national average, with only one topper from Patna this year. If there had been a leak, there would have been more than one topper from Patna and a higher number of high scorers, an NTA official said.NTA has faced criticism amid allegations of irregularities and inflated marks in the medical entrance exam conducted on May 5, the results of which were declared on June 4.On Congress's criticism of the lapses in NEET-UG, Pradhan said, ""They have just lost the elections and are now looking for a new issue. We have the facts, and misleading students and the public based on lies is not right."" On Congress's statement that the NEET issue would ""reverberate inside Parliament as well"", Pradhan said, ""I will reply with facts in Parliament.""Explaining the rise in toppers and cut-off marks this year, Pradhan said the NEET syllabus was reduced in line with NCERT's syllabus rationalisation.This, combined with aligning questions to state board syllabi and increased competition due to more candidates, led to the higher number of top scorers, he added.","Pradhan met several candidates who took the NEET-UG exam and their parents.

"How engineer-turned-cop checkmated reel hero, jailed top Kannada film star Darshan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-murder-how-engineer-turned-cop-checkmated-reel-hero/articleshow/110982273.cms,"Unravelling mystery

BENGALURU: When Sandalwood star Darshan was arrested , the million-dollar question asked in Karnataka 's political and police circles along with the public was who was instrumental in putting one of the biggest stars of Kannada film industry with a crazy fan base behind bars.As TOI started piecing together the murder puzzle involving 17 accused, including Darshan's girlfriend Pavithra Gowda , the role of one police officer stood out: deputy commissioner of police (west division) S Girish.""If not for this dynamic officer, the truth in the case would have got buried. Daring to pick a leading and influential film star on charges of murder requires courage,"" said a senior IPS officer, while commending Girish, assistant commissioner of police (Vijayanagar) Chandan Kumar, and also police commissioner B Dayananda who backed them. In fact, both Girish and Chandan have become 'real heroes' for many young cops on the verge of getting disillusioned by the system where dedication to do good barely fetches any brownie points.""Look at the sequence of events here: there was a murdered person and four guys who walked into station owning up the crime. The station-level officers believed the cooked-up story and chose to close the case. But Girish wasn't convinced,"" said sources. Usually, surrenders in murder cases happen in rowdy-related killings for security reasons. But the four who surrendered lacked consistency in their statements and, the victim was not an anti-social element. Girish, joined by Chandan , started grilling the four and learnt that the latter are just fall guys and are not connected to Renukaswamy. They were offered money to go to jail. Girish's next question was: ""Who offered money?"". The fall guys pointed to Vinay V, owner of a restaurant in RR Nagar, and police wasted no time in securing him. During questioning, Girish and Chandan learnt one of the accused had called a sub inspector in Kamakshipalya and inquired about the surrender process.Vinay, who is a close aide of Darshan, reportedly narrated how things went horribly wrong after Renukaswamy was picked up at the actor's behest and tortured in a godown in RR Nagar. He explained how Darshan was miffed with Renukaswamy's social media comments on his girlfriend Pavithra Gowda and mentioned the names of all those who were part of the torture squad. Police also retrieved CCTV footage of a Jeep Wrangler (which was used by Darshan) moving around along with a Scorpio near the place where the body was dumped.""Next, it was showtime as the 'Sultan of Sandalwood' had to be picked up. We thought it was not going to happen given the stardom and his proximity to politicians. But Girish sir proved us wrong,"" said a cop. While the aides were secured when they were returning from Mysuru, a discreet operation was launched to get Darshan, whose Sandalwood title is 'Challenging Star'.A team led by ACP Chandan Kumar landed at a star hotel in Mysuru where Darshan was staying in the wee hours of Tuesday. When Chandan walked up to the star in the hotel gym and told him to accompany the team, Darshan reportedly said: ""I know..everything got messed up. You carry on, I will come in my car.""Darshan's Rs 3-crore Land Rover Defender was parked at the hotel entrance. However, Chandan retorted: ""Will you come with us now or should you be....?"" Darshan, who had mouthed similar dialogues in his cop-themed movies earlier, realised the seriousness and got into the police jeep. He was brought to Bengaluru. Soon, the phone lines of Girish and the commissioner started buzzing. All moves to let the star walk free were checkmated as the TV channels started screaming about the arrest.""Both the actor and his well-wishers did not expect police to act at lightning speed, else the game would have changed,"" a cop claimed.Girish and Chandan were unavailable for comments.",Sandalwood star Darshan was arrested on charges of murder. Deputy commissioner of police (west division) S Girish played a key role in the case. Girish and the police commissioner have become'real heroes' for many young cops.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110987727,imgsize-1629307,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110987727.jpg"

MUMBAI: The bones and remains allegedly belonging to Sheena Bora, recovered by police in Raigad, Maharashtra, are currently untraceable, the prosecution said to a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court during the ongoing trial.

This disclosure was made on Thursday during the deposition of a forensic expert from the state-run JJ Hospital in Byculla, Mumbai. The court is currently recording the testimony of the forensic expert who first examined the bones recovered by the Pen police in 2012 from the site where Sheena Bora's burnt body was allegedly buried, as reported by PTI.

Indrani Mukerjea, Sheena Bora's mother, is the prime accused in the murder case. According to police, the 24-year-old Sheena Bora was killed in April 2012, though the crime only came to light in 2015.

On Thursday, Special Public Prosecutor CJ Nandode informed the court that the bones and remains, which were referred to and examined by the forensic expert, could not be located despite a thorough search. Nandode added that the prosecution plans to continue the chief examination of the witness without displaying the articles, as they are untraceable.

The CBI court adjourned the matter to June 27 for further evidence recording after defense advocates raised no objections to the prosecution's request.

He was accused of passing on secret information on BrahMos missiles to Pak intelligence operatives, who contacted him on social media in the guise of girls. His defence counsel has filed an appeal in high court. TOI has access to his case papers.Deo, however, told the court he did not come across any instance of Nishant tampering, sharing or misusing information from office computers even though his workstation had more classified information. The data allegedly found in his laptop was already in public domain, Deo told the court.Deo said he headed the warhead integration and mechanical department and did not receive any negative report about Nishant from the Intelligence Bureau or other security agencies. Nishant was also recommended for the young scientist award in 2018.However, NN Kumar, executive director (production) at the BrahMos unit, told the court that Nishant was not supposed to keep departmental information in his personal computer, which had a technical description of the missile - CK-310. This was highly classified information and a draft version for approval by technical specialists, he said on record.Responding to the defence lawyer, the investigating officer of Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) which arrested him in 2018, told the court that both Nishant and his wife were not inclined to Islamist ideology or involved in anti-national activity. ATS officer Pankaj Awasthi went on to say Nishant was not investigated for any assets disproportionate to his income and it's not true that he was not in possession of secret information during his training at the Hyderabad unit.","Nishant Agrawal worked in the missile assembly unit at Nagpur.

No complaint received in last 3 yrs of hate crimes by one community against other: NCM chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-complaint-received-in-last-3-yrs-of-hate-crimes-by-one-community-against-other-ncm-chief/articleshow/111007017.cms,"NEW DELHI: Three days after minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju dismissed talk of persecution of minorities as “propaganda” by vested interest, the National Commission for Minorities chairman Iqbal Singh Lalpura said that in the last three years they have not received any complaint of hate crimes by one community against another. He said, however, that they have been receiving individual cases of crimes involving minorities which, Lalpura said can be best categorised as “criminal acts”.“We get a lot of complaints ranging from marital disputes to property and we have been taking action in these. However, where one community fights against the other community such cases are zero,” Lalpura said.To bolster confidence of minority communities, quell insecurities and to understand their expectations, the NCM will be holding inter-faith meetings and to begin with on June 20 the NMC has plans to hold a “Sarv Dharm Samvad” where prominent members of the six minority communities will be invited for discussion. The NCM chief along with the members will also be visiting Ayodhya later this month. This will be their first visit since the Ram temple consecration.On being questioned over recent statement of AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi that instances of attacks on Muslims after elections have increased, Lalpura said he would like to publicly ask Owaisi to not just make statements but to bring these instance to the notice of the commission so that they can be investigated and action taken accordingly. Owaisi in a post on X on Thursday said, “Since the election results have come, instances of attacks on Muslims from different parts of the country have been increasing. Two Muslims were killed in UP, bulldozer was run over the houses of Muslims in Akbarabad and two Muslims were lynched in Chhattisgarh. Is the Sangh parivaar taking revenge from Muslims?”Meanwhile, Lalpura also condemned the comments made by former Pakistani cricketer Kamran Akmal on Indian cricketer Arshdeep Singh.

Muslims start the Hajj against the backdrop of the destructive Israel-Hamas war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/muslims-start-the-hajj-against-the-backdrop-of-the-destructive-israel-hamas-war/articleshow/110987255.cms,"MINA: In sweltering temperatures, Muslim pilgrims in Mecca converged on a vast tent camp in the desert on Friday, officially opening the annual Hajj pilgrimage . Ahead of their trip, they circled the cube-shaped Kaaba in the grand mosque , Islam's holiest site. More than 1.5 million pilgrims from around the world have already amassed in and around Mecca for the Hajj, and the number was still growing as more pilgrims from inside Saudi Arabia joined. Saudi authorities expected the number of pilgrims to exceed 2 million this year.This year's Hajj came against the backdrop of the raging war in the Gaza Strip between Israel and Palestinian militants, which pushed the entire Middle East to the brink of a regional war between Israel and its allies on one side and Iran-backed militant groups on the other.Palestinians in the coastal enclave of Gaza were not able to travel to Mecca for Hajj this year because of the closure of the Rafah crossing in May when Israel extended its ground offensive to the strip's southern city of Rafah on the border with Egypt.Palestinian authorities said 4,200 pilgrims from the occupied West Bank arrived in Mecca for Hajj. Saudi authorities said 1,000 more from the families of Palestinians killed or wounded in the war in Gaza also arrived to perform Hajj at the invitation of King Salman of Saudi Arabia. The 1,000 invitees were already outside Gaza - mostly in Egypt - before closure of the Rafah crossing.""We are deprived of (performing) Hajj because the crossing is closed, and because of the raging wars and destruction,"" said Amna Abu Mutlaq, a 75-year-old Palestinian woman from Gaza's southern city of Khan Younis who had planned to perform Hajj this year. ""They (Israel) deprived us of everything.""This year's Hajj also saw Syrian pilgrims travelling to Mecca on direct flights from Damascus for the first time in more than a decade. The move was part of an ongoing thaw in relations between Saudi Arabia and conflict-stricken Syria. Syrians in rebel-held areas used to cross the border into neighbouring Turkey in their exhausting trip to Mecca for Hajj.""This is the natural thing: Pilgrims go to Hajj directly from their home countries,"" said Abdel-Aziz al-Ashqar, a Syrian coordinator of the group of pilgrims who left Damascus this year for Hajj.The pilgrimage is one of the five pillars of Islam, and all Muslims are required to make the five-day Hajj at least once in their lives if they are physically and financially able to do it.It is a moving spiritual experience for pilgrims who believe it absolves sins and brings them closer to God, while uniting the world's more than 2 billion Muslims. It's also a chance to pray for peace in many conflict-stricken Arab and Muslim countries, including Yemen and Sudan, where more than a year of war between rival generals created the world's largest displacement crisis.For many Muslims, the Hajj is the only major journey that they made in their life. Some spend years saving up money and waiting for a permit to embark on the journey in their 50s and 60s after they raised their children.The rituals during the Hajj largely commemorate the Quran's accounts of Prophet Ibrahim, his son Prophet Ismail and Ismail's mother Hajar - or Abraham and Ismael as they are named in the Bible.Male pilgrims wear an ihram, two unstitched sheets of white cloth that resemble a shroud, while women dress conservative, loose-fitting clothing with headscarves, and forgo makeup and perfume. They have been doing the ritual circuit around the cube-shaped Kaaba, counter-clockwise in the seven-minaret grand mosque, since arriving in Mecca over recent days.Saudi authorities have adopted security restrictions in and around Mecca, with checkpoints set up on roads leading to the city to prevent those who don't have Hajj permits from reaching the holy sites.Security authorities arrested many people who attempted to take pilgrims to Mecca who didn't have Hajj permits, said Lt. Gen. Muhammad al-Bassami, head of Hajj security committee. Most of them were expelled from the country, while travel agents faced jail for up to six months, according to the Interior Ministry.On Friday, the pilgrims made their way to Mina, officially opening the Hajj. They then will move for a daylong vigil Saturday on Mount Arafat, a desert hill where the Prophet Muhammad is said to have delivered his final speech, known as the farewell sermon. Healthy pilgrims make the trip on foot, others use bus or train.The time of year when the Hajj takes place varies, given that Hajj is set for five days in the second week of Dhu al-Hijjah, the last month in the Islamic lunar calendar.Most of the Hajj rituals are held outdoors with little if any shade. When it falls in the summer months, temperatures can soar to over 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). The health ministry has cautioned that temperatures in the holy sites could reach 48 Celsius (118 Fahrenheit). Many pilgrims carried umbrellas against the burning sun.After Saturday's warship in Arafat, pilgrims will travel a few kilometers (miles) to a site known as Muzdalifa to collect pebbles that they will use in the symbolic stoning of pillars representing the devil back in Mina.Pilgrims then return to Mina for three days, coinciding with the festive Eid al-Adha holiday, when financially able Muslims around the world slaughter livestock and distribute the meat to the poor.

US sub pulls into Guantanamo Bay after Russian warships in Cuba,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-sub-pulls-into-guantanamo-bay-after-russian-warships-in-cuba/articleshow/111009682.cms,"Washington: A US navy submarine has arrived in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba, in a show of force as a fleet of Russian warships gather for planned military exercises in the Caribbean. US Southern Command said the USS Helena, a nuclear-powered fast attack submarine, pulled into the waters near the US base in Cuba on Thursday, just a day after a Russian frigate, a nuclear-powered submarine, an oil tanker and a rescue tug crossed into Havana Bay after drills in the Atlantic Ocean.

The stop is part of a ""routine port visit"" as the submarine travels through Southern Command's region, it said in a social media post. Other US ships also have been tracking and monitoring the Russian drills , which Pentagon officials say do not represent a threat to the US. ""We've seen them do these type of port calls before,"" Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh

The exercises, however, come less than two weeks after Prez Biden authorised Ukraine to use US-provided weapons to strike inside Russia to protect Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. Russian Prez Putin then suggested his military could respond with ""asymmetrical steps"" elsewhere in the world. Singh said it wouldn't be a surprise to see more Russian activity around the US. The drills are in international waters, and US officials expect the Russian ships to remain in the region through the summer and possibly also stop in Venezuela, which is also a Russian ally.

Russian ships have occasionally docked in Havana since 2008, when a group of Russian vessels entered Cuban waters in what state media described as the first such visit in almost two decades.

His opponent Donald Trump leads a Republican Party broadly favouring blocks to abortion access.The mifepristone case was the first significant abortion case heard by the conservative-dominated Supreme Court since it overturned the previously long-held constitutional right to abortion two years ago. ""We recognise that many citizens, including the plaintiff doctors here, have sincere concerns about and objections to others using mifepristone and obtaining abortions,"" said Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote the 9-0 opinion. ""But citizens and doctors do not have standing to sue simply because others are allowed to engage in certain activities,"" Kavanaugh said.The conservative justice said the federal courts were ""the wrong forum for addressing the plaintiffs' concerns about FDA's actions"" and they could present their objections through regulatory procedures or through the ""political and electoral processes"". Abortion opponents have been seeking to restrict nationwide access to the pill, claiming it is unsafe and that anti-abortion doctors were being forced to violate their conscience by intervening on patients who suffered complications after using it.Medication abortion accounted for 63% of the abortions in the country last year, up from 53% in 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute.Some 20 states have banned or restricted abortion since the SC in June 2022 overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that enshrined the constitutional right to abortion for half a century.

President Joe Biden faces first lawsuit: All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/president-joe-biden-faces-first-lawsuit-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/110968028.cms,"Here's all you need to know about the lawsuit:

The lawsuit has been filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and others on behalf of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES).

and others on behalf of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES). Filed against Biden administration's order that came into effect on June 5, it restricts the asylum processing to 2500 per day. The imposed limitations will remain in place until the daily encounter figures, averaged over seven days, reach or fall below 1,500. However, it remains uncertain when this threshold will be met; the last instance occurred in July 2020 amidst the Covid-19 pandemic.

According to the advocates, the order is ""legally indistinguishable"" from an order passed by Trump administration. “By enacting an asylum ban that is legally indistinguishable from the Trump ban we successfully blocked, we were left with no choice but to file this lawsuit, attorney Lee Gelernt said.

Biden has employed the same legal provision utilized by the Trump administration for its asylum prohibition, which falls within Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. This provision grants the president the authority to restrict entry for specific migrants if their arrival is judged to be ""detrimental"" to national interests.

White House spokesperson Angelo Fernández Hernández justified Biden's directive. Fernández said in a statement that it became essential after bipartisan negotiations were obstructed by congressional Republicans. These negotiations aimed to secure vital resources, statutory adjustments, and additional personnel for border management.

NEW DELHI: In a first, a lawsuit was filed against the US administration on Wednesday over an order issued by President Joe Biden last week limiting the asylum processing claims to 2,500 per day on the southern border.The advocates have argued that the order is similar to the one enacted during Trump administration . However, it was later blocked by the courts.The directive became effective on June 5, with officials from the Biden administration anticipating unprecedented deportation rates of 4,000 daily.","The lawsuit has been filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and others on behalf of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services.

Clash between Pakistan judiciary & military establishment intensifies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/clash-between-pakistan-judiciary-military-establishment-intensifies/articleshow/111007675.cms,"Islamabad: The clash between Pakistan’s superior judiciary and the powerful military establishment has intensified as judges have started questioning the conduct of serving army and Inter-Services Intelligence officers over their blatant interference in judicial matters.Several high court and lower court judges have complained that since May 9, 2023 Pakistan’s powerful authorities (army, ISI) have tried to pressure them using intimidatory tactics such as secret surveillance, and even abduction and torture of their family members, to secure favourable outcomes in political cases related to Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party and its incarcerated founder, Imran Khan.Addressing an event in the garrison city of Rawalpindi on Friday, Lahore high court chief justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad claimed he has received complaints — many verbally — and letters regarding interference in judicial matters by “institutions” (a reference to the army and ISI).“But I have full faith that this interference of the (military) establishment in the judiciary will come to its end very soon,” he asserted.He said he was saying so not just because it was “part of my faith but also includes my experience”.“To get rid of the (military) establishment’s interference, we have to face it with bravery, courage, and without any fear, and with the belief that this interference, God-willing, will end soon,” the Lahore CJ said. “Temporary worries do come but you have to face them eye to eye and not be a target of any of their blackmailing. Do not be hesitant to make any kind of sacrifice,” he added.Justice Ahmad said Pakistan was currently “going through one of the longest periods of a civil government”, adding that the 2007 lawyers’ movement “closed the doors for martial law forever”.On Wednesday, the Lahore HC had summoned Punjab police chief Usman Anwar and other officials on a complaint from a presiding judge of an anti-terrorism court alleging harassment by intelligence and law enforcement agencies.On June 7, the HC registrar’s office had received a special report on district and sessions judge Muhammad Abbas wherein he had said that on May 25, the first day of his new charge, a message was conveyed to him that some ISI authority wanted to meet him in his chamber.Upon refusing to meet the said authority, Abbas alleged that ever since then he had been encountering various incidents, such as firing outside his court in Punjab’s Sargodha city and questioning of family members, among other things.Earlier, in March, six of the eight Islamabad HC judges had penned a startling letter to Supreme Court judges, regarding attempts by the ISI to pressure them through the abduction and torture of their relatives as well as secret surveillance inside their homes. Following the letter, judges from other HCs also acknowledged interference by spy agencies in judicial functions.It led the apex court to take suo motu notice of the matter, with high courts submitting their responses and recommendations as proceedings continued.","Several high court and lower court judges have complained that since May 9, 2023 Pakistan’s powerful authorities (army, ISI) have tried to pressure them using intimidatory tactics.

We already had a better offer before the formation of the present government,"" the spokesperson claimed.Maulana Rehman led an opposition alliance, namely the Pakistan democratic movement (PDM), during the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government of Imran Khan.The PDM later formed a government at the centre, led by prime minister Shehbaz Sharif, after the ouster of Imran Khan's government in a vote of no-confidence in April 2022.The fissures within Pakistan's ruling coalition government have surfaced in recent days, with the PPP, a key ally, accusing the ruling PML-N of side lining its inputs in the preparation of the annual budget and questioning if the Shehbaz Sharif-led government still values its support.The PPP expressed its reservations in its parliamentary committee meeting presided over by the party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Tuesday, ahead of the presentation of the budget for the financial year 2024-25 in Parliament.The PPP has blamed the PML-N government for not taking any inputs from the party while preparing the annual budget and wondered if it still wanted the ally's support.",Shehbaz Sharif has invited his former ally JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman to become a part of the ruling coalition.

Muhammad Abbas made the allegation in a letter to Lahore high court chief justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan.

The judge has been hearing the cases against opposition leader in parliament Omar Ayub and other workers of Imran's PTI party in connection with the May 9, 2023 violence related to attacks on military installations in May last year. Ayub had alleged last week at a hearing that the judge was ""hostage"" of the intelligence agencies.

CJ Ahmad Khan summoned Punjab IGP Usman Anwar on Thursday and asked him why the roads leading to anti-terrorism court (Sargodha), some 200 km from Lahore, were closed by police when the judge refused to meet an ISI officer. The IGP replied: ""The roads were closed as the judge was facing serious threats"". The chief justice reserved his verdict on the alleged harassment of the ATC judge by the ISI.

In March, six judges of the Islamabad high court reached out to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) informing alleged intrusion of intelligence operatives in judicial matters.

This allowed elected local representatives to continue the provision of services to their electorate. The local elections were subsequently held in August 2023 for 72 key positions in 21 districts.Commenting on the law and order situation in the province, the rights body alleged that over 160 policemen, 70 military personnel, 60 civilians, and more than 170 alleged militants were killed in dozens of targeted militant attacks and security operations in 2023.Attempting to address the situation, Pakistan forcibly deported over 1.5 million documented and 0.7 million undocumented Afghan refugees and migrants from the province following an announcement by the federal caretaker government.Shedding light on the financial issues faced by people, the rights body stated that hundreds of teachers, doctors, health workers, and sanitation workers protested against delays in payment of salaries and other dues in separate demonstrations across the province in 2023.The report also addressed the status of Public health and environmental crises which has been a major issue of concern to the citizens. The HRCP report stated, that at least 11 per cent of the population suffers from drug abuse, and around 40 fatalities from rains, flash floods, and dust storms occur in several districts.Persons with disabilities also remained deprived of essential accessibility measures in most buildings despite court orders, and 4.7 million children, 66 per cent of which included girls, remained out of school in 2023, the report added.According to HRCP's media monitoring for 2023, there were at least 20 cases of domestic violence, 72 cases of sexual violence, 49 'honour' killings, and 246 femicide-related murders that reportedly took place in the province.HRCP cited a report from the Digital Rights Foundation, which stated that 112 complaints related to cyber harassment and gender-based violence were reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.In January, women councilors from the Khyber district elected in the 2021 local government polls protested the denial of functional authority and development funds to help female constituents of their areas.While over 100 women contested in the polls and several were elected, they had neither been provided offices nor resources, unlike their male counterparts, thereby lowering their status in people's perceptions, the report added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), in its annual report, highlighted the precarious situation of human rights, law and order.

Pak PM says his China trip was successful,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-pm-says-his-china-trip-was-successful/articleshow/110919451.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday that his trip to China last week was successful, while the opposition parties took him head-on, describing the tour as one that focused mainly on the security of Chinese people in Pakistan.Sharif’s visit came as Islamabad is seeking more foreign investment and looking to boost exports in a time of economic crisis and security concerns .Accompanied by the powerful army chief, General Asim Munir, Sharif took more than 100 Pakistani businessmen with him.Apprising cabinet members of his visit, PM Sharif said that despite the security issue highlighted during engagements with the Chinese leadership and business community, his five-day visit concluded on a “positive note”.“During the conversation with the Chinese ambassador at the banquet hosted by the Communist Party secretary during my visit to Shanxi province, I got a deep feeling that the visit remained very successful,” Sharif remarked, adding that a high-powered Chinese delegation would visit Pakistan soon.A joint statement issued at the end of the visit had stated that China and Pakistan had signed 23 agreements and MoUs in different fields. The joint declaration, however, noted that Beijing would not push businesses to take unwarranted risks or make concessions to Pakistani companies. Instead, the statement said, Beijing would support businesses to invest in Pakistan in line with market and commercial principles.Observers, however, pointed out that obstacles still stand in the way of strengthening Beijing-Islamabad economic collaboration, primarily as a result of Pakistan’s misguided policies.Pakistan is currently experiencing a debt crisis and looking for new loans to pay off previous debt.The total debt that Pakistan owes just to power (electricity) plants established under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) stands at around $7.5 billion. Islamabad also owes nearly $2 billion in circular debt, or unpaid bills, to Chinese electricity producers.During Sharif’s visit, no public statement was issued on restructuring debt but experts believe the issue is crucial and cannot be ignored.Pakistan’s current foreign debt, media reports suggest, is close to $130 billion, and Chinese officials say around 13% of it is owed to China.During the visit, Sharif, along with Gen Munir, also held talks with Chinese president Xi Jinping for more than three hours, indicating that the security of its nationals in Pakistan is a key concern for Beijing. Five Chinese workers were killed in a suicide attack in Pakistan’s northwestern Bisham region in March. Pakistan had blamed Afghanistan-based terrorists for the attack. The ruling Afghan Taliban had rejected Pakistan’s claim, saying Islamabad was trying to sour Kabul’s relations with Beijing.In the joint statement, both sides urged Afghanistan to “firmly combat terrorism, including not allowing its territory to be used for terrorist acts”.","Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday that his trip to China last week was successful.

Some resistance fighters have been injured in these attacks, highlighting the junta's improved proficiency in utilizing UAVs.According to Min Zaw Oo, executive director of the Myanmar Institute for Peace and Security think-tank, the junta began procuring thousands of Chinese commercial UAVs at the start of the year, modifying them to carry locally-manufactured munitions. While the junta has not publicly addressed its recent use of UAVs, regime leader Min Aung Hlaing acknowledged last year that rebels had dropped over 25,000 bombs using drones during a major October offensive on military posts.Despite the junta's acquisition of armed CH-3 UAVs from China around 2013, resistance members report that the military is currently deploying multi-rotor commercial drones, including those designed for agriculture, in their latest sorties. The limited number of junta drones observed on the frontline suggests that the military has not yet deployed all of its newly procured aircraft.As the civil war continues, the resistance appears to have lost its early advantage of being the main fighting force using drones, according to analysts and rebel fighters. The junta's expanding UAV attack fleet is a welcome development for demoralized military forces relying on conscription to replenish shrinking frontline battalions.

"No competitive politics left in Bangladesh, says nobel laureate Yunus",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/no-competitive-politics-left-in-bangladesh-says-nobel-laureate-yunus/articleshow/110901366.cms,"DHAKA: Bangladesh has turned into a ""one-party"" state as the ruling party stamps out political competition, Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, a pioneer of the global microcredit movement, said in an interview.An election in January won prime minister Sheikh Hasina a fourth straight term, but it was boycotted by the main opposition party, whose top leaders were either jailed or in exile ahead of the poll.Yunus, who helped to lift millions from poverty by providing tiny loans of sums less than $100 to the rural poor, angered Hasina with a 2007 plan to set up a political party.The 2006 Nobel laureate accused Hasina's ruling Awami League party of being involved in rampant corruption, saying Bangladesh lacked a genuine political opposition.""Bangladesh doesn't have any politics left,"" Yunus, 83, said last week in his office in Dhaka, the capital. ""There's only one party which is active and occupies everything, does everything, gets to the elections in their way.""He added, ""They get their people elected in many different forms- proper candidates, dummy candidates, independent candidates - but all from the same party.""Law minister Anisul Huq said he completely disagreed with Yunus' comments, however.""It's not only I who disagree, but the people of the country will also disagree,"" Huq told Reuters by telephone, calling the remarks an ""insult"" to the people of the country.""Democracy is fully functional in this country,"" he added.Yunus, an economist who won the Nobel for his work on microcredit, was forced out of Grameen Bank in 2011 by Hasina's government, which said he had stayed on past the legal retirement age of 60.Hasina, 76, is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of the South Asian nation killed in an army coup in 1975, along with most of his family. She first became prime minister in 1996.As Bangladesh's longest-serving prime minister, Hasina has been credited with turning around the economy, though critics have also accused her of human rights violations and suppression of dissent.The US state department said January's elections were not free and fair while the British government's foreign office also condemned acts of ""intimidation and violence"".At the time, the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) denounced the exercise as a ""sham"" election, calling for its cancellation, Hasina's resignation and the formation of a non-party neutral government to hold a fresh one.Just before the election, a court in Bangladesh had sentenced Yunus to six months in prison for violations of labour law, which he denied.Although he is not in prison after securing bail in that case, Yunus faces more than 100 cases regarding the violations and graft accusations, which he dismissed as ""very flimsy, made-up stories"".Huq denied the accusations against Yunus were false, however, adding, ""He has gone to the highest court of the country, which found there was a case against him.""As an example, Huq cited taxes paid by Yunus after the supreme court ruled against him in a tax-evasion case, but declined comment on others as being sub-judice.Yunus' supporters say Hasina's government has sought to discredit him because he once considered setting up the political party, called ""Citizens' Power"".Hasina, who denies the contention, called Yunus a ""bloodsucker"" of the poor in 2011.""Is it a crime for a citizen to try to make a political party?"" Yunus asked, saying he dropped the idea of such a party after just 10 weeks, on realising that he was not suited to politics.Reviving a competitive political landscape in Bangladesh will be difficult, however, Yunus said.""Restarting will be very painful because we have brought it to a point where it has completely disappeared.""","Bangladesh has turned into a ""one-party"" state, Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus says. Yunus helped lift millions from poverty by providing tiny loans of sums less than $100 to the rural poor. He angered prime minister Sheikh Hasina with a 2007 plan to set up a political party. Law minister Anisul Huq says he completely disagrees with Yunus' comments.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110901607,imgsize-637270,width-400,resizemode-4/110901607.jpg"
Three Rohingyas killed in Bangladesh after clash between rival groups over dominance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/three-rohingyas-killed-in-bangladesh-after-clash-between-rival-groups-over-dominance/articleshow/110896957.cms,"(With AFP inputs)

COX'S BAZAR: At least three Rohingya refugees were killed, and seven others injured following a clash between rival militant groups struggling for control over relief camps in Bangladesh.Bangladesh shelters one million members of the stateless and persecuted Muslim community, the majority of whom arrived after a severe military crackdown in Myanmar in 2017.Most of these refugees live in vast, crowded camps. This year, there has been an increase in skirmishes between armed groups, partly due to the forced recruitment of refugees into Myanmar's civil war.On Monday, at least 100 members of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army ( ARSA ) attacked a group of refugees conducting a security patrol in a camp located in Cox's Bazar district, according to police.""They cut barbed-wire fence surrounding the camp and launched the attack on Rohingyas who were protecting the camp,"" said Mohammad Iqbal, a commanding officer of the Armed Police Battalion, which is tasked with maintaining security in the camps.""Three Rohingyas were killed and seven were injured. When police came to the spot, ARSA members also attacked police,"" he told AFP, adding that the victims had been variously shot and attacked with knives.A Rohingya community leader in the camps, speaking on condition of anonymity, has said the three slain men were members of the Rohingya Solidarity Organisation ( RSO ).""Murders and gunfights are occurring every day and night in the camp. ARSA killed three RSOs yesterday. No Rohingya are safe here. ARSA and RSO have made the camps hell for the Rohingya refugees,"" he said.Security within the Rohingya camps has been declining since April. Rival Rohingya groups have initiated campaigns to forcibly recruit young men and teenage boys to combat in Myanmar.About 1,500 Rohingya have been coerced from the camps to join the conflict, according to a confidential report circulated among UN agencies last month and viewed by AFP.Worried parents and Rohingya community leaders have organized patrol groups in the camps to prevent recruitment raids.At least 20 Rohingya have died this year in clashes between rival militant groups, as reported by the national daily Prothom Alo.Different Rohingya armed groups are individually gathering troops for Myanmar's military, responsible for their violent expulsion from the country in 2017.These groups argue that the Rohingya must ally with past enemies within the Myanmar army to confront a new threat.The recruits have been sent across the border to engage with the Arakan Army, which seeks greater autonomy in Myanmar's Rakhine state, also home to roughly 600,000 Rohingya.","Bangladesh shelters one million members of the stateless and persecuted Muslim community.

Reform UK overtakes PM Sunak's Conservatives in opinion poll,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/reform-uk-overtakes-pm-sunaks-conservatives-in-opinion-poll/articleshow/110977680.cms,"LONDON: In a recent YouGov poll conducted for the Times newspaper, Nigel Farage 's Reform UK Party surpassed Prime Minister Rishi Sunak 's Conservative Party for the first time, just weeks before Britain's upcoming election on July 4. The survey, which involved 2,211 participants and was carried out from June 12-13, revealed that Reform UK garnered 19% support, a 2% increase from their previous standing, while the Conservatives remained unchanged at 18%. The opposition Labour Party maintained its lead with 37% of the vote.

The poll results come in the wake of Sunak's pledge to reduce taxes for working individuals by 17 billion pounds, as outlined in his party's election manifesto. Meanwhile, Reform UK's popularity has been on the rise since Farage, renowned for his instrumental role in the successful Brexit campaign, announced his return to frontline politics, assuming leadership of the party and declaring his intention to run for parliament. In a video posted on X, Farage confidently stated, ""This is the inflection point, the only wasted vote now is a Conservative vote, we are the challengers to Labour and we are on our way.""

Reform UK, a small right-wing party established in 2018 under the name Brexit Party, advocates for populist policies such as stricter immigration laws. Sunak's campaign has also faced setbacks, including sharp criticism for his early departure from D-Day memorial events compared to other world leaders. It is important to note that while Reform UK has surpassed the Conservatives in this particular poll, other opinion polls indicate a more substantial lead for the Conservatives over Reform UK.

Despite Reform UK's strong showing in the nationwide vote share, the party is not expected to secure many parliamentary seats due to the nature of Britain's electoral system. The 'winner takes it all' approach, which lacks proportional representation, means that Reform UK could amass millions of votes across the country without achieving a majority in any of the 650 individual constituencies that constitute the British parliament. In contrast, support for larger and more established parties like Labour and the Conservatives tends to be more concentrated in specific geographic areas, giving them an advantage in securing seats.
