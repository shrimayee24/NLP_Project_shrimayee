MUMBAI: Four migrant workers from West Bengal died of asphyxiation on Sunday after stepping into a basement water tank at an under-construction 40-plus-storey building in Nagpada. One worker was injured while attempting a rescue. The tank had been shut for two years, leading to accumulation of sludge and toxic gases due to past chemical treatments.Workers at the site said it was common practice to step into water tanks without safety gear, but none of them was aware of the hazardous conditions inside this particular tank. “No safety kit was provided. They should have left the tank open for a while to let the gases escape,” said Bhutan Sheikh, who was injured.At the time of going to press, police were in the process of registering four accidental death cases. An FIR may be lodged if police find negligence on the part of the builder. “We are questioning the labour contractor. We are summoning all individuals concerned ,” said a police officer.",Four migrant workers from West Bengal died of asphyxiation after stepping into a basement water tank at an under-construction 40-plus-storey building.

In rape case,

prosecutrix testimony

enough to convict: Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: In an over 40-year-old incident of sexual assault of a schoolgirl by her tuition teacher, Supreme Court has confirmed his guilt and sentence while ruling that courts can record conviction even in absence of injury to the prosecutrix’s private parts, when other evidence corroborates rape.The accused had argued that rape charges could not be proved as there was no injury to the private parts of the girl and alleging that the girl’s mother, a “women of easy virtue”, was making false allegations against him.Rejecting both the arguments, a bench of Justices Sandeep Mehta and Prasanna B Varale said, “Merely because in the medical evidence, there are no major injury marks, this cannot be a reason to discard the otherwise reliable evidence of the prosecutrix.”Writing the judgment, Justice Varale said, “It is not necessary that in each and every case in which rape is alleged there has to be an injury to the private parts of the victim and it depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular case. We reiterate that absence of injuries on the private parts of the victim is not always fatal to the case of the prosecution.”The bench also said that it is a settled principle of criminal jurisprudence that the evidence of a prosecutrix in a case of rape carries the same value as that of an injured witness and conviction can be made on the basis of the sole testimony of the prosecutrix.Turning to the accused’s allegation about the character of prosecutrix’s mother, the bench said the court need not go into its veracity as it has no bearing on the case. “We find no reason to accept the contention that the alleged immoral character of the mother of the prosecutrix has any bearing on the accused being falsely roped in on the basis of a concocted story.”“The question of conviction of the accused for rape of the prosecutrix is independent and distinct. It has absolutely no connection with the character of the mother of the prosecutrix and seems to be a dire attempt at using it as a license to discredit the testimony of the prosecutrix. We find no merit in these contentions,” the bench said.The case also reflects a sad state of affairs of the three-tier judiciary system where trial courts are far more prompt in rendering decisions in criminal cases compared to constitutional courts. The incident of sexual assault by a tuition teacher is of March 1984. The trial court convicted the man in 1986. However, Allahabad high court took 26 years to uphold the trial court verdict and SC another 15 years to do the same.When the girl went for tuition on March 19, 1984, the teacher sent out the two other girls for different works and sexually assaulted the girl after gagging her and locking the room from inside. The other two girls knocked on the door, but it was not opened. Eventually, the grandmother of the girls came and rescued the girl. When the girl’s family attempted to lodge an FIR, the inhabitants of the mohalla and family members of the accused threatened them. Despite the threats, the FIR was lodged after some delay.","The incident of sexual assault by a tuition teacher is of March 1984. The trial court convicted the man in 1986.

How Manipur spiraled back to violence?

NEW DELHI: Day-to-day life came to a standstill in the Kuki-dominated areas in Manipur on Sunday after a retaliatory indefinite strike was enforced against the ""crackdown by security forces."" Although no fresh violence has been reported, the situation in the state's Kangpokpi district remained calm but tense.This comes a day after at least one person died while 40 were injured in clashes between Kuki demonstrators and security forces protesting free movement along all roads in the ethnic strife-torn state.In Manipur's Kuki-dominated areas in Churachandpur and Tengnoupal, protestors burnt tyres and blocked roads with boulders. The roads were, however, cleared later by the security forces.Meanwhile, shops and other business establishments remained closed and few vehicles were seen plying the roads in Kuki-dominated areas in the state. Protestors also asked locals to remain indoors.Additional security forces have been deployed in Gamghiphai and other parts of the district along the NH-2 (Imphal-Dimapur Road) and vehicular patrolling was being conducted to ensure law and order, a district official said.The state police recovered weapons, ammunition, explosives, and various military-grade equipment during security force operations on March 7.Manipur Police in a press release shared the details, ""Search operations and area domination were conducted by security forces in the fringe and vulnerable areas of hill and valley Districts.""""One SMG Carbine with one empty Magazine, One Single Bolt Action Rifle, One .303 modified Rifle, One local made Single Barrel, One .22 Rifle, two Revolver cartridge box containing 12 live round each, five of .36 HE grenade Indian made, One Walkie Talkie wireless set, one Chinese grenade, one MK 2 Grenade, One Tube Launching IA, 14 Tear Smoke Shell , One 38 mm cartridge Anti-Riot with Rubber bullet, One Smoke Shell (Chilli), one Stun Shell (Normal), One Bullet Proof Helmet, two Rice bags, one Cotton cloth mix colour (red and white), four black polythene from Sekmaijin Hangul under Hiyanglam-PS, Kakching District on March 07,"" Manipur police said in a statement.""Two 81mm country made Pumpi motor, two 51 mm country made Pumpi Gun, two country made motor bomb, nine INSAS empty case, seven SLR-empty case, two SBBL-empty case, Cortex wire -8m, one Baofeng set (unserviceable), Telescopic sight with cover from general area of Thawai Kuki village under Litan-PS, Ukhrul District,"" it added.On Saturday, the Kuki Zo council imposed a shutdown and called upon the Centre to ""reconsider its stance to avoid further escalation of tension"".""It is crucial for the central government to address the underlying issues to prevent further unrest and protect public safety. The Kuki-Zo Council urges the government to reconsider its stance to avoid further escalation of tension and violent confrontation,"" it said.""We cannot guarantee free movement of Meiteis across buffer zones and cannot take responsibility for any untoward incidents,"" it added.The Indigenous Tribal Leaders' Forum (ITLF), a Kuki-Zo body, extended support to the indefinite shutdown called by Kuki Zo Council (KZC) in all areas inhabited by the community in Manipur to protest the crackdown of security forces on demonstrators protesting free movement along all roads in the ethnic strife-torn state.In a statement, ITLF said, ""Yesterday, the Government of India's decision to allow the movement of Meiteis through Kuki-Zo areas led to agitation and protest in Kangpokpi... the security forces used excessive force on the protesters.""Endorsing the indefinite shutdown called in all Kuki-Zo areas, ITLF asked everyone to ""adhere to the shutdown in solidarity"".""We respect everyone who came out to protest yesterday,"" the ITLF said.Manipur Police, in a statement, said 27 security personnel were injured in the attacks by the Kuki protesters who pelted them with stones, and barricaded roads by putting up huge boulders, setting tyres on fire and felling trees.""Amid the protests, there were incidents of firing from amongst the protesters towards the security forces, to which the security forces retaliated,"" the statement said.""Due to heavy pelting of stones, use of catapults and random firing by armed miscreants from amongst the protesters, 27 security forces personnel suffered injuries, including two critical injuries,"" it said.""The security forces showed tremendous restraint while trying to control the unruly and violent mob and used minimum force to control and counter the anti-social elements. During the skirmish, 16 protesters were reportedly injured and one protester succumbed to injuries,"" it said.Security forces clashed with the protestors opposing Amit Shah's ""free movement"" directive and march by the Federation of Civil Society (FOCS), a Meitei body. The demonstrators set fire to several private vehicles while attempting to block a state transport bus traveling from Imphal to Senapati district. They also burned tyres along NH-2 (Imphal-Dimapur highway) and gathered on the roads to obstruct the movement of state government vehicles.""We are just following orders. We have been told to stop the march. If they want to go, they can go in the state buses arranged by the government,"" a policeman said.Police arrested seven members of four banned outfits in separate operations, officials informed. This comes a day after two cadres of the proscribed Kangleipak Communist Party (PWG) were apprehended in Lamphel, Imphal West district, while another member of the same outfit was caught near the gate of Bir Tikendrajit international airport, a senior officer reported.The arrested individuals were identified as Moirangthem Jiban Singh (27), Laishram Tiken Singh (40), and Thoudam Premkumar Singh (38). Authorities also recovered Rs 50,000 from those held in Lamphel. ""These members of the militant group have been identified as Keisham Naocha alias Ningsingba (38) and Ningthoujam Sanjoy (18) and handed over to the local police for necessary legal actions,"" an officer said. Additionally, on Thursday, security forces arrested two members of the banned Kanglei Yaol Kanna Lup (KYKL) near the Lokchao River along the India-Myanmar border in Tengnoupal district.According to the police, fra esh spell of violence began when a Manipur State Transport bus, traveling along the Imphal-Kangpokpi-Senapati route, was targeted by a mob at Gamgiphai in Kangpokpi district. The crowd started pelting the vehicle with stones, prompting security forces to deploy tear gas and use minimal force to disperse the protesters.The protest was also directed against a peace march organized by the Federation of Civil Society (FOCS), a Meitei organization. The procession, which involved over 10 vehicles, was stopped by security forces at Sekmai before it could reach Kangpokpi district. Police stated that the procession was halted because the organizers did not have the necessary permission.On March 1, Union home minister Amit Shah had instructed security forces to ensure free movement of people across all routes in Manipur starting from March 8. He also emphasized that strict action should be taken against those obstructing this movement.This directive was particularly significant, as uninterrupted travel throughout the state had been severely impacted since ethnic violence erupted between two communities in May 2023. The violence resulted in the deaths of over 250 people and displaced thousands.On February 13, the Centre imposed President's rule in Manipur following the resignation of Chief Minister N. Biren Singh, which led to political instability in the northeastern state.The Manipur Assembly, which is set to serve until 2027, has been put under suspended animation, as confirmed by a notification from the Ministry of Home Affairs.On February 20, Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla urged the people of the state to voluntarily surrender looted and illegally held weapons within seven days, assuring that no punitive action would be taken against those who returned arms during this period. The deadline was later extended until 4 p.m. on March 6, in response to demands from people in both hill and valley areas for more time.","The state police recovered weapons, ammunition, explosives, and various military-grade equipment during security force operations on March 7.

Mufti Shah Mir , accused of helping Pakistan's ISI in kidnapping Indian businessman and former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav from Iran, was shot dead on Friday night by unidentified gunmen in Turbat, Balochistan Mir, known to be involved in human trafficking , was leaving the local mosque after Taraweeh (night) prayers when bikers ambushed him and shot him multiple times at point-blank range. According to a report in Dawn, Mir was immediately shifted to hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.Mir, a human and arms trafficker, operated under the cover of a mufti (scholar) and was a member of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, an Islamic fundamentalist political party.Sources said he was an important conduit linked with ISI-led death squads and played a significant role in the abduction and extrajudicial killing of numerous Baloch youths. He was also instrumental in spreading religious extremism in Balochistan.In March 2016, Jadhav was abducted by a group led by Mullah Omar Irani of Jaish al-Adl from the Iran-Pakistan border and handed over to the Pakistan army through several intermediaries, including Mir. Irani was also killed, along with his two sons, in the same area (Turbat) in Nov 2020, allegedly by ISI.Mir is also suspected to have been gunned down by ISI operatives in what is believed to be an internal conflict that has been brewing for some time. Last week, two others of JUI-F -- Wadera Ghulam Sarwar and Molvi Amanullah -- were shot dead by bike-borne assailants in what the local police described as targeted killings. The security guard of one also sustained bullet injuries. Mir had also survived two attempts on his life last year and had recently restricted his movements. ""He was providing intelligence about Baloch fighters to the Pak army. In 2023, a teacher named Abdul Rauf was murdered over alleged blasphemy in Turbat. The killing was carried out on the instructions of Mir,"" a source informed.Jadhav, who was running a business in Chabahar (Iran) after a premature retirement from the Navy, was abducted and incarcerated on false charges in Pakistan. He was intercepted in the Chaman area of Balochistan on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border on March 3, 2016. In April 2017, a Pakistani military court sentenced Jadhav to death, charging him with involvement in espionage and sabotage activities. India condemned the verdict as a premeditated murder. The International Court of Justice stayed the execution while asking the Pakistan government to review the conviction process besides grant consular access to India.","Mufti Shah Mir, accused of helping Pakistan's ISI in kidnapping Indian businessman and former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav from Iran, was shot dead on Friday.

GUWAHTI: Manipur’s restive hills resonated with disquiet on Sunday amid the silence of an indefinite shutdown called by the Kuki-Zo Council in Kangpokpi, Churachandpur, Tengnoupal, Pherzawl and other tribal-dominant areas after weekend clashes with security personnel left a Kuki protester dead and over 20 injured.The shutdown since Saturday night, supported by the Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum (ITLF), was called in protest against the crackdown on Kuki tribals opposed to the resumption of civilian traffic between the hills and the valley after more than 18 months. The Kuki-Zo Council and ITLF are also sticking to their demand for a separate administration for the hill districts.The clashes occurred in Kangpokpi when protesters tried to block vehicular movement between the valley and hills, defying home minister Amit Shah 's recent directive to restore free movement.While no violence was reported on Sunday, traffic between the hills and valley remained suspended. Protesters burned tyres and blocked roads with boulders and makeshift barricades, all of which were cleared by security forces.“The Centre’s decision to allow free movement of Meiteis through the Kuki-Zo area led to the agitation in Kangpokpi. Security forces used excessive force on the protesters… ITLF extends its deepest respects to Lalgouthang Singsit, who sacrificed his life, as well as to everyone who suffered injuries. We respect everyone who came out to protest for the cause of our people yesterday,"" ITLF said. “Govt may take our lives, but they can never take away our freedom and rights,” the forum said, urging the Kuki-Zo community to remain united.Protesters allowed only emergency traffic through the hill districts. Additional security forces were deployed at Gamgiphai, the gateway to Kangpokpi, and other locations in the district where clashes broke out Saturday. Forces also patrolled NH-2 to ensure unrestricted vehicle movement. Manipur Police wrote on X that 27 security personnel were injured in Saturday’s clashes, with two of them in a critical condition.“Security forces showed tremendous restraint while trying to control the unruly and violent mob and used minimum force to control and counter the anti-social elements, including firing by armed miscreants from among the protestors,” the post said.“Further, it is to clarify that claims made in press releases of Kuki-Zo Council and Kuki Students’ Organisation dated March 8, 2025, that security forces were escorting local protesters are totally baseless.”A Manipur State Transport Corporation bus, four LPG containers and three oil tankers were escorted through the Imphal-Bishnupur-Churachandpur and Churachandpur-Bishnupur-Imphal routes.

CUTTAK: Orissa high court has acquitted a 42-year-old murder convict, out on bail after 14 years in jail, due to insufficient evidence .A bench of justices Sangam Kumar Sahoo and Chittaranjan Dash in its March 7 judgment set aside a 2008 life sentence given to Madan Kanhar by a sessions judge in Phulbani district for the murder of a 20-year-old woman in 2005. In 2008, Kanhar had appealed in HC, which granted him bail in 2019.The woman had gone to collect firewood in a jungle near her village in Phulbani but did not return. Her mother found her dead in the jungle on April 12, 2005, with injuries on the head and other parts of the body. Kanhar, a resident of the same village, was held primarily as the deceased had picked up a quarrel with him a few days ago.“Discrepancies in eyewitness testimony, inconsistencies in discovery of evidence, and the inconclusive forensic findings collectively fail to establish an unbroken chain of circumstances leading solely to the appellant’s guilt,” HC said. According to the bench, “while the postmortem report confirmed the homicidal nature of death, it does not conclusively link the appellant (Kanhar) to the crime”. “The testimony of the supposed eyewitness lacks the sterling quality required for unassailable reliance,” the HC said. The judges said “in the absence of unimpeachable and irrefutable evidence, the benefit of doubt must necessarily go to the appellant, as no conviction can be sustained on mere suspicion or weak circumstantial evidence”.“The administration of justice demands nothing less than proof beyond reasonable doubt, and in its absence, the appellant’s culpability remains unproven,” the bench observed.Kanhar’s advocate Jambeswar Pati said his client had been making a living as an agricultural labourer since being released on bail six years ago.","Madan Kanhar was given a life sentence in 2008 for the murder of a 20-year-old woman.

KOPPAL: The third suspect in the Hampi horror in which two women, including an Israeli tourist, were gang-raped and a male companion murdered was arrested Sunday from an undisclosed location in Tamil Nadu.The women — the 27-year-old Israeli and her female homestay host — were targeted late Thursday night by the three intruders while stargazing at Sanapur lake in Karnataka’s Koppal, about 25km from Unesco world heritage site Hampi.A male tourist from Odisha, part of the group of five, was beaten and fatally pushed into a Tungabhadra canal along with two others, but the two of them swam to safety.The gruesome attack drew widespread outrage and concerns over the safety of tourists at Hampi and its vicinity. Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah and deputy CM DK Shivakumar have promised a thorough probe and justice. The third suspect, identified only as Sharanappa, is being brought from Tamil Nadu, police said. Two of his accomplices were held Saturday and identified as Mallesh alias Handi Mallesh, 22, and Chetan Sai Sillekyatar, 21. Mallesh and Chetan were taken to the scene of crime Sunday for reconstruction of events. All three face charges of sexual assault and murder, police said. The two sexual-assault survivors, who had been admitted to the local Gangavathi Sub-Division Hospital early Friday, were discharged on Sunday, officials said.The attackers had also robbed the survivors, snatching two cellphones and Rs 9,500 in cash before fleeing the scene. The body of Bibash Nayak, 26, who drowned after being pushed into the canal, was brought home to Odisha and his last rites performed there.","The third suspect, identified only as Sharanappa, is being brought from Tamil Nadu.

SAD raps ‘rebels’ as Majithia show of defiance sparks row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sad-raps-rebels-as-majithia-show-of-defiance-sparks-row/articleshow/118824985.cms,"Majithia and 6 other SAD functionaries had condemned SGPC’s move to sack jathedars of Akal Takht & Takht Keshgarh Sahib

CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) announced Sunday a crackdown on “indiscipline” within the organisation and drafted show-cause notices to Bikram Singh Majithia , brother-in-law of ex-party chief Sukhbir Singh Badal , and all other functionaries who made statements or put out videos criticising Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee’s decision last Friday to sack the Akal Takht and Keshgarh Sahib jathedars.“Everyone is free to express views at the appropriate party forum, but nobody will be allowed to violate discipline as nobody is above the party. All anti-party statements and videos are being referred to the disciplinary committee. Action will be taken after consideration of their replies to show-cause notices,” SAD working president Balwinder Singh Bhunder said.Party spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema said the alleged breach of speaking out in public against the decisions of SGPC and SAD was discussed at the parliamentary board’s meeting in Chandigarh.The meeting was convened after Majithia and six other SAD functionaries issued a joint statement condemning SGPC’s decision to remove Giani Raghbir Singh as Akal Takht chief and Giani Sultan Singh as Takht Keshgarh Sahib jathedar. The group demanded Panthic unity.“There have been much bigger crises (in Akali Dal). He (Majithia) should not have made this statement. As a SAD functionary, he played the role of ‘super CM’ for 10 years and is today issuing such statements.... Given his relationship with the (Badal) family, he should have sat down with them and talked it out. This is wrong,” Bhunder told TOI.He denied that SAD’s foundation was shaken by this show of dissent. “Earlier, nine people went with Sudhar Lehar, and this is not a bigger storm than that.” Targeting Sudhar Lehar members, Bhunder said they were “using religion for personal interest”.Gurpartap Singh Wadala, who is a member of Akal Takht-constituted oversight panel for SAD’s membership drive, said Majithia’s statement proved that a section of SAD functionaries was upset over the party not implementing Akal Takht’s directions.“The churn has begun...It will intensify in the wake of none other than Majithia going against his brother-in-law and raising questions about the state of affairs in the party”.Punjab Congress chief Raja Warring wrote on X that the dispute was a “fixed match to keep power within the family”. “If Majithia is truly driven by Panthic conscience, why didn’t he oppose the removal of Giani Harpreet Singh Ji, the jathedar of Takht Damdama Sahib?”Now, Nihang groups have threatened to scuttle the installation of anew jathedar of Takht Keshgarh Sahib on Monday, while also seeking the immediate reinstatement of the sacked jathedars.","Bikram Singh Majithia and 6 other SAD functionaries had condemned SGPC’s move to sack jathedars of Akal Takht & Takht Keshgarh Sahib. “Everyone is free to express views at the appropriate party forum, but nobody will be allowed to violate discipline as nobody is above the party,” SAD working president Balwinder Singh Bhunder said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118824988,imgsize-763111,width-400,resizemode-4/118824988.jpg"

The Karnataka government has ordered a ban on sale of soaps, detergents and shampoos within 500 metres of rivers and tanks to protect the waterbodies from pollution caused by the products. State environment and ecology minister Eshwar Khandre, instructing officials to regulate its sale, also issued orders to prevent devotees from leaving behind their old clothes in the waterbodies.Referring to the use-and-throw culture, the minister said the devotees damage the ecosystem of waterbodies at holy places. “Most devotees leave behind used soaps, detergents, and shampoo packets along the bathing ghats of rivers, lakes, and temple ponds. Eventually, these are let into the rivers, which affects the quality of water,” the minister said in a letter to additional chief secretary to the environment and ecology department.A senior department official told TOI that due to these unchecked activities, waterbodies at pilgrimage centres are rich in phosphates and other chemical compounds, resulting in increased frothing of water.","The Karnataka government has ordered a ban on sale of soaps, detergents and shampoos within 500 metres of rivers and tanks.

Multiple vehicles were gutted in the fire

MUMBAI: Panic broke out after an MGL pipeline running under an Andheri East road was allegedly damaged by an excavator during unauthorised digging soon after Saturday midnight, causing a leak that sparked a 40ft-high blaze. Three motorists were injured, two of whom are critical, and multiple vehicles were gutted.The injured—bikers Arvind Kumar Kaithal (21) and Aman Saroj (22) as well as auto driver Suresh Gupta (52)—were rushed to Jogeshwari Trauma Care Hospital. Kaithal and Saroj, who suffered at least 50% burns, were later shifted to Airoli Burns Centre. “We will know in three to four days if the two are out of danger,” said Sunil Keswani, medical director of the centre.The road wears a busy look during the day but sees relatively less traffic late at night. A fire brigade official said MGL quickly disconnected the gas supply, and fire personnel contained the blaze and extinguished it in an hour.An MGL official said the road digging work was not authorised and the gas supply was restored by Sunday afternoon following repairs.ACP (Andheri division) Dr Shashikant Bhosale said an FIR has been lodged against the contractor and the earthmover operator for negligence. “We have sought an inquiry report from the fire department and BMC on the safety measures that were supposed to have been taken at the site,” he said.An eyewitness who lives in the area said two excavators were digging up the road near Sher-e-Punjab Society when one of them hit the gas line. “One of the excavator operators immediately fled. Soon, there was a blast and a fire broke out. Vehicles that were passing by caught fire, and two bikers and an auto driver were injured.” He said amid the panic, residents near the site promptly evacuated buildings. “The fire also damaged cables and traffic signals.”"," Panic broke out after an MGL pipeline running under an Andheri East road was allegedly damaged by an excavator during unauthorised digging.

Xavier Worthy Avoids Charges Following Arrest in Texas



Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Xavier Worthy will not be facing any charges following his recent arrest in Williamson County, Texas. Worthy was taken into custody on Friday under allegations of assault against a family or household member, specifically by impeding their breathing or circulation. However, after further review, the Williamson County District Attorney’s Office has decided not to proceed with the case at this time.The Austin American-Statesman reported late Saturday that District Attorney Shawn Dick made the decision after speaking with multiple witnesses. He confirmed that Worthy and his legal team were fully cooperating with the authorities as the investigation continued.“After further investigation by the Williamson County Sheriff’s Office and further discussion with a third-party witness, Mr. Worthy and his attorneys, this case is being declined at this time pending completion of the investigation by the Williamson County Sheriff's Office,"" Dick emailed the Statesman.He also clarified that the case could be revisited if additional evidence emerged. ""Mr. Worthy and his lawyers are fully cooperating with this investigation. We will continue to evaluate the case. As is our practice with all declines, should you develop additional information indicative of probable cause in this case, our office will consider that information and may present the case at that time to a Williamson County Grand Jury.”Worthy, who was arrested in Georgetown, Texas, was released from custody on Saturday following the DA’s decision.Shortly before the DA’s announcement, Worthy’s attorneys, Chip Lewis and Sam Bassett, released a statement strongly refuting the claims made against their client.""We are aware of the allegation that led to Mr. Worthy's arrest,"" the statement read. ""... The complainant was recently asked to vacate Mr. Worthy's residence upon discovery of her infidelity. She has refused to do so and made a number of extortive efforts prior to resorting this baseless allegation against Mr. Worthy.""The legal team’s remarks indicate that Worthy was dealing with a personal dispute that escalated into a legal matter. The attorneys asserted that the allegations were motivated by personal grievances rather than actual wrongdoing.The 21-year-old wide receiver was selected by Kansas City with the No. 28 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft after an impressive college career at the University of Texas. In his rookie season, he made an immediate impact, leading the Chiefs' receiving corps with 59 receptions for 638 yards and six touchdowns.

"Who are Alawites, and why are they being targeted in Syria?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/who-are-alawites-and-why-are-they-being-targeted-in-syria/articleshow/118829154.cms,"Relatives and neighbours attend the funeral procession for four Syrian security force members killed in clashes with loyalists of ousted President Bashar Assad in coastal Syria (Photo credit: AP)



Who are the Alawites?

An ambush on a Syrian security patrol by pro-Assad gunmen near Latakia has escalated into days of clashes, with over 1,000 reported dead. The violence, which marks the worst Syria has seen since December, has reignited deep-seated sectarian tensions, particularly targeting the Alawite community , a minority that once formed the backbone of Bashar al-Assad’s rule.The assault by Alawite insurgents overwhelmed government forces, briefly taking control of Qardaha, Assad’s hometown, before security forces reasserted control. While authorities have since attempted to restore order, the fighting triggered a wave of revenge killings, with Sunni militants targeting Alawite civilians. Despite interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa’s assurances of inclusivity, many Alawites fear they are being persecuted under the new Islamist-led government.The Alawites, an offshoot of Shia Islam, played a central role in Assad’s power structure, benefiting from political and military influence for over five decades. With Assad’s ousting, they have become vulnerable to retribution. Islamist factions within Syria’s new leadership view them as remnants of a regime they fought to dismantle, further inflaming the sectarian divide.Rights groups estimate that hundreds of Alawite civilians have been killed, with reports of homes looted and burned. Damascus blames rogue elements for the violence, but critics argue the government’s failure to protect the minority community exposes deep-rooted biases within the new leadership.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported widespread killings, with 745 civilians, 125 security personnel, and 148 pro-Assad fighters among the dead. The situation remains dire, as essential services such as electricity and water have been cut off in Alawite-majority areas. Some rights groups claim government forces and militants alike have committed atrocities, raising concerns that the conflict could spiral further out of control. The US and UN have condemned the violence, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio calling for accountability for “radical Islamist terrorists, including foreign jihadis.”Sharaa has responded by establishing an investigative committee to examine the killings and ensure those responsible face justice. However, his rhetoric has also included warnings against “remnants of Assad’s regime,” signaling a crackdown on Alawite insurgents. Many remain sceptical that the new government, dominated by former HTS figures, will truly safeguard Syria’s religious and ethnic diversity.Syria’s neighbours, including Turkey, Iraq, and Jordan, have expressed alarm over the escalating crisis, fearing regional instability. Meanwhile, the US and Europe remain hesitant to lift sanctions, citing concerns over Syria’s political future.","Violence reignites deep-seated sectarian tensions, particularly targeting the Alawite community.

Full: New Canada PM Mark Carney SHOCKS Trump With Big Retaliation Threat | Watch

Who is Mark Carney?

Following his tenure as Britain's central bank chief from 2013 to 2020, Carney will take over from 59-year-old Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January amidst pressure from fellow party members.

Currently serving as chairman of Brookfield Asset Management, a Canadian alternative investment firm, 59-year-old Carney must schedule a general election before or on October 20.

His historic appointment as Bank of England governor in 2013 marked the first time a non-citizen led the institution since its establishment in 1694. He guided the UK economy through Brexit and the early pandemic response, before Andrew Bailey assumed leadership in March 2020.

Post his central bank role, Carney has maintained various financial sector positions and served as an adviser to Trudeau.

Mark Carney , who has been selected as Canada 's next prime minister after Justin Trudeau announced his resignation, said that US President Donald Trump is attacking Canadian workers , and families, and Ottawa cannot let him succeed.Responding to Trump’s trade war and his talk of making Canada the 51st US state, Carney on Sunday said Ottawa will never be part of America in any way.Following his victory announcement, introduced by his daughter Cleo, Carney said, “We have made this the greatest country in the world and now our neighbours want to take us. No way.” He also said Americans “want our resources, water, our land, our country.""Carney asked people to imagine the consequences if Trump take over Canada, ""America is a melting pot. Canada is a mosaic.""""Donald Trump, as we know, has put, as the prime minister just said, unjustified tariffs on what we build, on what we sell, on how we make a living. He's attacking Canadian families, workers and businesses, and we cannot let him succeed. And we won't. We won't. I am proud. I am proud of the response of Canadians who are making their voices heard and their wallets felt. I am grateful for how our provinces are stepping up to the fight,"" Carney said.“America is not Canada. Canada will never ever be part of America in any way, shape or form.""Carney had earlier gained attention for comparing Donald Trump to ""Voldemort"", the villain in the Harry Potter films and books.Speaking at an event amid Trump making statements on making Canada the 51st US state, Carney said, ""When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments.""""Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about,"" he said last month.","Mark Carney has been selected as Canada's next prime minister after Justin Trudeau announced his resignation.

AMMAN: Syria's top diplomat and his counterparts from neighboring countries Sunday called for the lifting of Western-led sanctions on Syria and post-war reconciliation.The foreign ministers of Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon made their remarks alongside Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani following a meeting in the Jordanian capital Amman.They come following days of clashes between Syrian security forces and insurgents of the minority Alawite community loyal to the deposed Bashar Assad government in Syria's coastal province. Some rights groups say hundreds of civilians, mostly Alawite, were killed in revenge attacks after the fighting broke out. The Associated Press could not independently verify those numbers.The United States and Europe have been hesitant to lift sanctions on Syria before there is a clear political transition that is democratic and inclusive of Syria’s minorities and civil society. At the same time, the country desperately needs money to rebuild after years of war and pull millions out of poverty. The United Nations estimates that some 90% of Syria’s population lives in poverty.“We are protecting all components of the Syrian people, and we do not discriminate between them. We will not allow the repetition of the tragedies of the Syrian people,” said al-Shibani.Syria's new Islamist authorities under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa have struggled to convince the United States and Europe to lift sanctions to start rebuilding the country after 13 years of war and reconcile with the Kurds in the northeast and Druze in the south to exert state authority across the country.The weekend's violence appears likely to stymie attempts to remove sanctions in the immediate future. The U.S. and U.N. released statements condemning the killing of civilians, which U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described as being carried out by “radical Islamist terrorists, including foreign jihadis.” He called for Damascus to hold the perpetrators accountable.Also on Sunday, al-Sharaa announced the formation of a committee tasked with investigating the violence in coastal communities, including “violations against civilians” and another one tasked with “maintaining civil peace.”Al-Sharaa said in a video statement that the outbreak of violence was part of “attempts by remnants of the former regime, with foreign parties behind them, to create new strife and drag our country to a civil war, with the goal of dividing it and destroying its unity and stability.”He said the country’s new authorities “will not tolerate the remnants of Assad who committed crimes against our army forces and state institutions” and promised to “hold accountable with all firmness and without leniency anyone who was involved in the blood of civilians or harmed our people.”It remained to be seen whether those measures will succeed in calming the situation and reassuring both Syrians and the international community.Syria's neighbors fear that the country's pulverized economy and internal tensions could impact their own stability.“Stability in Syria requires dialogue with the country's various components,” said Iraqi Foreign Minister Fouad Hussein at a joint news conference.The foreign ministers were critical of what they said was foreign intervention in the region after Israeli troops conducted military operations in southern Syria and seized a U.N. buffer zone that divides Syria from the Golan Heights, which Israel seized and annexed in 1967. On Sunday, the Israeli commanding officers visited and assessed the buffer zone.Turkish Foreign Minister Fidan welcomed the “historic” meeting and called for cooperation to decrease tension in Syria, and said he alongside others will work against sleeper cells belonging to the extremist Islamic State group and affiliates of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party in Syria and Iraq.“This is a regional problem. Regardless of our ideals we should all combat IS as well as the PKK, they are both terrorist entities,” he added.Iraq's foreign minister warned that IS sleeper cells are growing in numbers.“We need to take the initiative first in exchanging views and information about (the Islamic State group's) latest operations and especially their expansion not only on the Syrian borders with Iraq and Jordan but also their expansion in the Syrian land,” said Hussein.","The foreign ministers of Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon made their remarks alongside Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani following a meeting in the Jordanian capital Amman.

SEOUL: North Korea on Monday condemned joint US-South Korean military drills as a ""provocative act"", warning of the danger of sparking war with ""an accidental single shot,"" days after Seoul's air force mistakenly bombed a village on its own territory.""This is a dangerous provocative act of leading the acute situation on the Korean peninsula, which may spark off a physical conflict between the two sides by means of an accidental single shot,"" said Pyongyang's foreign ministry, as quoted by state media.The joint US-South Korea "" Freedom Shield 2025 "" exercise was set to kick off on Monday, and will involve ""live, virtual, and field-based training"", according to a US statement.The exercise will run until March 21, the statement said.Military cooperation between Seoul and Washington regularly invites condemnation from Pyongyang, where the government sees such moves as preparation for an invasion, and often carries out missile tests in response.The latest exercise comes after two South Korean Air Force fighter jets accidentally dropped eight bombs on a village during a joint training exercise with US forces on March 6.Fifteen people, including civilians and military personnel, were wounded in that incident, South Korea's National Fire Agency said.Relations between Pyongyang and Seoul have been at one of their lowest points in years, with the North launching a flurry of ballistic missiles last year in violation of UN sanctions.The two Koreas remain technically at war since their 1950-1953 conflict ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.The United States stations tens of thousands of soldiers in the South, in part to protect Seoul against Pyongyang.The large-scale Freedom Shield exercises are one of the allies' biggest annual joint exercises.In its statement on Monday, North Korea's foreign ministry dubbed the exercises ""an aggressive and confrontational war rehearsal"".Last week, Pyongyang slammed the United States for ""political and military provocations"" over the visit of a US Navy aircraft carrier to the South Korean port of Busan.","North Korea condemns joint US-South Korean military drills as a ""provocative act"" Pyongyang warns of the danger of sparking war with ""an accidental single shot"" Comes after Seoul's air force mistakenly bombed a village on its own territory.

Hundreds of Alawite civilians killed in ‘executions’ by Syria’s security forces • FRANCE 24

A Syrian war monitor reported on Monday that security forces and allied groups have killed 973 civilians in a series of ""massacres"" in coastal areas and the Latakia Mountains since March 6.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, ""The total number of civilian martyrs who were liquidated amounted to 973, including women and children,"" adding that ""killings, field executions, and ethnic cleansing operations"" were still ongoing following deadly clashes between security forces and Alawite gunmen loyal to toppled president Bashar al-Assad.Syria has been in turmoil since Bashar al-Assad was overthrown in December. The insurgent-led government that replaced him has struggled to maintain control, and tensions have exploded into sectarian violence. Clashes between security forces and Assad loyalists have triggered widespread attacks, particularly against the Alawite community, which was the backbone of Assad’s regime.The bloodshed began on Thursday when government forces attempted to detain a suspect near Jableh but were ambushed by armed Assad supporters. In response, security forces launched crackdowns in Alawite strongholds along the Mediterranean coast. Authorities claim they were targeting remnants of Assad’s forces but admitted that ""individual actions"" contributed to the killings.Under Assad, Alawites dominated the military and security agencies. Now, they are being targeted as the new government blames Assad loyalists for ongoing attacks.In several areas, Alawites have faced retribution killings, looting, and arson. Witnesses described horrific scenes where gunmen stormed homes, executed Alawites in the streets, and set properties on fire. Thousands have fled into the mountains, fearing further attacks.One of the worst-hit towns, Baniyas, saw bodies left uncollected in the streets as residents were too afraid to retrieve them. Ali Sheha, a 57-year-old resident, told AFP that at least 20 of his neighbours had been killed, some inside their shops and homes. ""Gunmen were firing at houses, looting shops, and checking IDs to execute Alawites,"" he said.By early Saturday, the revenge killings had slowed, but the devastation was immense. Observatory chief Rami Abdurrahman called it ""one of the biggest massacres"" of the conflict.","The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, ""The total number of civilian martyrs who were liquidated amounted to 973, including women and children"" Witnesses described horrific scenes where gunmen stormed homes, executed Alawites in the streets, and set properties on fire.

What's Daylight Saving Time

?

When does it begin?

Is Daylight Saving Time worth it? Debate rages on

What Trump said

Trump Asked When He Will Get Rid Of Daylight Saving Time, Says It Is A '50/50 Issue'

Clocks in the US will jump an hour on Sunday, marking the start of Daylight Saving Time . This annual practice moves clocks forward by one hour during the summer months.It’s an yearly practice in the US and Europe to move clocks forward during summer, extending evening daylight to optimise energy use and better align daily schedules with natural light.In North America, Daylight Saving Time 2025 will begin on Sunday, March 9, at 2:00 AM local standard time and will end on November 2 at 2:00 AM.At that moment, clocks will move forward one hour to 3:00 AM local daylight time. This change extends evening daylight but shortens the morning hours. While most of the United States observes DST, some regions do not follow the springtime adjustment.In Europe, Daylight Saving Time will start on March 30, 2025, at 1:00 AM GMT, with clocks moving forward by one hour. Most European countries follow this change to extend daylight hours during the spring and summer months.After winning the election last year, Trump had said he and Republicans would work to “eliminate” daylight saving time, calling it inconvenient and costly.However, when asked in the Oval Office on Thursday about eliminating Daylight Saving Time, Trump said, “It’s a 50-50 issue, and when something is split like that, it’s hard to get excited about it.”Trump said he figured most people would prefer more daylight in the evening but acknowledged that “some people want more light in the morning because they don’t want to take their kids to school in the dark.”","Clocks in the US will jump an hour on Sunday, marking the start of Daylight Saving Time.

Britain's King Charles III made an appeal on Saturday for unity in ""uncertain times"", as the 76-year-old monarch emerges as a key figure in the UK's diplomatic drive over Ukraine.Britain and European countries have been scrambling to present a united front following US President Donald Trump 's sudden withdrawal of support for Ukraine three years into Russia's invasion.By tradition, the UK head of state's role is politically neutral. But in recent days, Charles has hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at his private estate and invited Trump for a historic second state visit.On Monday, Charles will deliver a message for Commonwealth Day , which celebrates the 56-nation club of mostly former British colonies.According to extracts published late on Saturday, Charles -- who heads the Commonwealth -- said nations' differences should be a ""source of strength"".""In these uncertain times, where it is all too easy to believe that our differences are problems instead of a source of strength and an opportunity for learning, the Commonwealth's remarkable collection of nations and peoples come together in the spirit of support and, crucially, friendship.""Earlier on Saturday, British leader Keir Starmer said that Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was considering joining a group of countries prepared to protect an eventual ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war .British officials have held talks with around 20 countries interested in being part of the so-called ""coalition of the willing,"" a UK official said on Thursday.The official refused to name the nations but said they were ""largely European and Commonwealth partners"".Charles' message is set to be published in full on Monday.","Britain's King Charles III makes appeal for unity in ""uncertain times"" The 76-year-old monarch emerges as a key figure in the UK's diplomatic drive over Ukraine.

Trump made clear ‘Elon Musk is your partner’ in Cabinet meeting, says Commerce secretary

Two senior Republicans reinforced US President Donald Trump 's recent stance on Elon Musk ’s influence, emphasising that the Department of Government Efficiency cannot override Cabinet officials or dismiss federal employees, stating that, ""he is a partner and has no power to fire people.""“Elon Musk does not have the power to fire people,” Republican Senator Rick Scott of Florida said Sunday in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper. “The president of the United States is Donald Trump, and the agency heads are the ones who manage each of their departments,” he added.Scott's remarks followed a tense Cabinet meeting where administration officials voiced concerns about Musk's interference in staffing and policy decisions within their agencies.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy subsequently described the meeting as ""productive"" in a post to X on Friday, whilst indicating his broader concerns about Musk's agenda to restructure federal bureaucracy.“The President’s approach of a scalpel versus a hatchet and better coordination between Secretaries and DOGE is the right approach to revolutionizing the way our government is run,” Duffy said, Politico reported.During the meeting, Trump instructed his Cabinet officials that Musk lacks authority to make staffing and policy decisions—marking Trump's first significant limitation on Musk's authority. Trump clarified that DOGE's role is advisory, with Cabinet officials retaining final authority over staffing, policies and implementation.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick , another GOP official, acknowledged DOGE's contributions during a Sunday interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" with Kristen Welker. When questioned about agency leadership, Lutnick characterised Musk as his ""partner.""“Elon Musk is your partner,” he said. “He’s your partner in technology, he’s your partner in thought, he’s your partner in doing. What President Trump made clear, is that Elon is your partner. That is what we like,” he added.Trump's revised guidelines for DOGE follow Musk's initiatives for extensive redundancies and proposals to eliminate numerous government agencies, causing distress amongst federal employees.Despite DOGE's controversial actions, Lutnick indicated Cabinet officials remain united in collaborating with Musk to reduce government expenditure. “You have the best technologist and richest guy in the world saying ‘I’ll help you,’ come on, we want his help,” Lutnick concluded.","GOP Senator Rick Scott says 'Elon Musk does not have the power to fire people' Scott's remarks follow a tense Cabinet meeting where administration officials voiced concerns about Musk's interference in staffing and policy decisions within their agencies.

Trump commented about Zelenskyy. ""He took money out of this country, under Biden, like candy from a baby.

We gave him 350 billion and he is talking about the fact that they have fought and they have this bravery,"" Trump added.The Republican president further emphasised his role in providing Javelin anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, asserting that the ongoing conflict would have been prevented had he been in office when it commenced in 2022.""All he (Zelenskyy) had to do is say (to Europe), you got to stay even with us (the US) ... We're not in danger, they (Europe) are ...So they're paying all this money to Russia, and we're in there for $350 billion,"" he explained.Previously, Trump had ordered a pause on all military aid to Ukraine, escalating tensions between Washington and Kyiv just days after a heated Oval Office confrontation with Zelenskyy.The move effectively halts the delivery of billions in US weaponry, leaving Ukraine uncertain about its ability to sustain its defense against Russia.When Bartiromo questioned Trump about abandoning Zelenskyy before finalising a minerals agreement, asking: ""Are you comfortable with that, the fact you walked away and Ukraine may not survive?""Trump responded: ""Well, it may not survive anyway.

'Things definitely went a bit cool in Washington after Sandringham'



King Charles' message of unity in 'uncertain times'



The photo of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy standing shoulder to shoulder with King Charles soon after Zelenskyy's public fallout with Donald Trump in the White House peeved Trump so much that he does not feel the same about Britain. Trump was extended a state visit to Britain presented by UK PM Keir Starmer but after the bonhomie between the monarch and Zelenskyy, Trump feels less special about the invitation. According to a DailyMail report, the feelings have not been kept a secret as Trump allies conveyed Trump's displeasure to the UK officials in America but they were told that no one directs the King.President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance fought with Zelenskyy on television as Vance accused Zelenskyy of not being grateful enough for all that te US has been doing to resolve the war. After Zelenskyy's humiliation, many European leaders supported Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy's meeting with King Charles was scheduled at the same time. And to 'hurt' Trump some more, outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau too met King Charles.Daily Mail reported that 10 Downing Street sources did not 'recognize' the claims that Trump was sulking over King Charles meeting Zelenskyy and Trudeau but citing a well-placed source, it reported: ""Things definitely went a bit cool in Washington after Sandringham. We told them that the King makes his own decisions about who he meets.""Sandringham is King Charles's Norfolk home where Zelenskyy met the monarch.No 10 sources, according to the report, denied any tension between the UK and the US following King Charles' meeting with Zelenskyy and said the PM spoke to Trump on Monday and there has been positive engagement -- Trump likes to call Starmer directly on his mobile phone.King Charles will deliver a message for Commonwealth Day on Monday. According to the extracts of the speech published Saturday, the king would deliver a message of unity. ""In these uncertain times, where it is all too easy to believe that our differences are problems instead of a source of strength and an opportunity for learning, the Commonwealth's remarkable collection of nations and peoples come together in the spirit of support and, crucially, friendship,"" the message reads.","Donald Trump was reportedly sulking as Volodymyr Zelenskyy was warmly greeted by King Charles.

DHS employees face lie detector tests as agency seeks to root out media leaks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dhs-employees-face-lie-detector-tests-as-agency-seeks-to-root-out-media-leaks/articleshow/118816579.cms,"AP photo

US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has launched an aggressive crackdown on media leaks by making employees take polygraph tests.DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ordered that all future lie detector tests within the department must include questions about unauthorised communication with the media and nonprofit groups. The directive, first reported by Bloomberg Government, is part of a larger effort to stop leaks that expose sensitive operations.“The Department of Homeland Security is a national security agency,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said. “We can, should, and will polygraph personnel.”Customs and Border Protection (CBP), a DHS agency, already uses polygraph tests for new hires, but expanding them to existing employees signals a major shift.Noem and President Trump’s Border Czar, Tom Homan, blame leaks for immigration raids being compromised and a drop in arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).“Their job is dangerous enough. So we are going to address this very seriously,” Homan said in early February.On Friday, Noem announced in a video on X that DHS has already found two “criminal leakers.” She said they will be referred to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for “felony prosecutions,” warning they could face up to 10 years in prison.“We will find and root out all leakers. They will face prison time & we will get justice for the American people,” Noem declared.","DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ordered that all future lie detector tests within the department must include questions about unauthorised communication with the media and nonprofit groups.

Peshawar Shooting Incident: Pakistani man kills WhatsApp group admin in anger after being removed from chat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-man-kills-whatsapp-group-admin-in-anger-after-being-removed-from-chat/articleshow/118803475.cms,"-

A man in Pakistan has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting the admin of a community WhatsApp group who removed him from the chat, police said on Saturday.The shooting took place on Thursday evening in Regi, a locality on the outskirts of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan and has a history of sectarian violence .According to police records and a local official, the suspect, identified as Ashfaq Khan, has been charged with the murder of Mushtaq Ahmed. The dispute began when Mushtaq removed Ashfaq from the WhatsApp group following an argument. Hoping to reconcile, both men agreed to meet, but Ashfaq allegedly arrived with a gun and opened fire, killing Mushtaq on the spot.The police report noted that both men were in the process of reconciliation when the suspect suddenly opened fire. The motive behind the attack was “in reaction to removal from WhatsApp group,” as stated in the report.Humayun Khan, the victim’s brother, told Arab News that he was present at the scene but was unaware of the nature of the dispute.“My slain brother Mushtaq and Ashfaq had developed some differences in a WhatsApp group, forcing my brother to remove the latter. Ashfaq got infuriated and shot my brother dead,” he said. “It was a non-issue or a very trivial matter. No one in our family even knew about the dispute at all.”Local police officer Abid Khan confirmed that Humayun had filed a complaint against Ashfaq, who fled the scene after the attack. Authorities are conducting raids to apprehend him.The incident has triggered widespread reactions on social media, with many expressing sorrow over such violence during the holy fasting month of Ramadan.Easy access to firearms, the influence of tribal customs, and weak law enforcement in the region often contribute to minor disputes spiralling into deadly confrontations.","A man in Pakistan has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting the admin of a community WhatsApp group who removed him from the chat.

KARACHI: Six members of the minority Ahmadi community were arrested by police on Saturday after it earlier provided protective custody to around two dozen of them following threats from a sectarian politico-religious party. The police registered cases against the Ahmadi community members after taking them into protective custody when Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) activists gathered outside their place of worship in Surjani town of Karachi to prevent them from offering ""Friday prayers"".""Today, we arrested six people on the complaint of a TLP activist in Surjani,"" a senior police official said.The approximately 500,000-member Ahmadi community in Pakistan is a religious minority which claims itself as Muslims but was officially declared ""non-Muslim"" in 1974 through an amendment in the constitution.They have faced prosecution from right-wing religious parties notably in the Punjab province in recent times.Amir Mahmood, a community spokesperson, said TLP activists had gathered outside their place of worship since Friday afternoon and threatened to tear it down.DIG West, Irfan Baloch, said the TLP activists demanded the arrest of Ahmadi community leaders and the sealing of their place of worship.Ahmadis have generally done their religious rites inside closed buildings to avoid trouble as their worship places have been destroyed and damaged by right-wing religious protesters in the past.Mahmood said detaining Ahmadis from their place of worship for performing their rituals ""was a grave violation of human rights and Pakistan's Constitution"".DIG Baloch said the police would get a ""legal opinion"" about the place of worship as it was a sensitive matter.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) said on Tuesday it observed a growing trend of mob-led attacks on the homes of families belonging to religious minorities and their places of worship.The HRCP in a report also mentioned the ""arbitrary"" detention of Ahmadis, the alleged desecration of their graves, and the vulnerability of Hindu and Christian women to forced conversion.The HRCP in its report ""Under Siege: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2023-24"" said about 750 persons were in prison on charges of blasphemy as of October last year.It documented at least four faith-based killings, three of which targeted the Ahmadiyya community.","Ahmadis have generally done their religious rites inside closed buildings to avoid trouble.

Taliban-linked outfit claims dozens of Pakistan soldiers killed in cantonment attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/taliban-linked-outfit-claims-dozens-of-pakistan-soldiers-killed-in-cantonment-attack/articleshow/118743228.cms,"Photo/ANI

ISLAMABAD: Anguished cries of mourners preparing to bury their dead pierced an uneasy calm in Bannu cantonment of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Wednesday, a day after 13 civilians and five soldiers were killed in a burst of mayhem caused by militants ramming two explosives-laden vehicles into a wall of the army compound.Seven of the civilian casualties in the violence late Tuesday were children while five were women. Jaish al-Fursan, a militant group linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack and declared that dozens of soldiers were killed.The army said its prompt response to the militant incursion into the cantonment city helped thwart what could have been a suicide attack with far more devastating consequences. All 16 militants involved in the raid were killed, taking the casualties to 34, the military's media wing said.Schools and shops in Bannu city didn't open the morning after and remained shut throughout the day, reflecting that gloom that descended in the area, adjacent to the restive North Waziristan tribal district bordering Afghanistan. This was the second militant attack on the cantonment within a year and the third within Pakistan since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan last Sunday.In a statement shared on social media, Jaish al-Fursan said the blasts were triggered through explosives-laden vehicles.Official sources said the militant raiders blew up the vehicles at the gate after they were intercepted by security personnel stationed at the entrance. The attack started at 6.30pm, minutes after iftar (break in fasting), and was followed by an unspecified number of militants trying to infiltrate the camp. This resulted in a gunfight that continued till the last of the militants were killed.Over a dozen people were buried in the debris of walls and roofs of multiple houses destroyed by the explosions.

ISLAMABAD: US President Donald Trump's announcement to Congress late Tuesday about the capture of most-wanted terrorist Mohammad Sharifulla – mastermind of the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing outside Kabul airport that killed 13 American military service personnel and 170-odd Afghans – came with a surprise pat on Pakistan's back for its role in the operation.""Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice,"" Trump said in his first address to Congress since returning to the White House for a second term.""I want to thank especially the govt of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster,"" he said of the prolonged search culminating in forces tracing Sharifulla to a hideout on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.According to US media reports, CIA and Pakistani intelligence worked closely to find Sharifulla, whom Pakistan described as a ""top-tier operational commander"" of the proscribed Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-KP). The terrorist outfit had claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing that followed the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan that year.Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif was quick to highlight what his govt sees as an opportunity to regain the US's faith as a strategic partner following years of friction, notably after America's exit from Afghanistan and Washington’s growing closeness with India.Within the country, it gives the Sharif govt an advantage over former PM Imran Khan's Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), whose Pakistani-American supporters in the US had campaigned for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. They would possibly be disappointed by Trump's speech to Congress, which included no reference to Imran, PTI or Pakistan's democratic process.Sharif separately announced Sharifullah's arrest through a post on X. ""We thank US President Donald Trump for acknowledging and appreciating Pakistan's role and support in counter terrorism efforts across the region,"" he wrote.""As is well-known, Pakistan has always played a critical role in counter terrorism efforts aimed at denying safe havens to terrorists and militant groups the space to operate against any other country.""In neighbouring India, the reference to ""any other country"" could well spark a debate for a different reason.",US President Donald Trump announced the capture of most-wanted terrorist Mohammad Sharifulla.

The big picture



Renewed counterterrorism cooperation: A Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan’s assistance in the arrest stemmed from “excellent cooperation” between Islamabad and Trump’s new administration. This marks a shift from recent years, where US-Pakistan security collaboration had diminished following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan.

A Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan’s assistance in the arrest stemmed from “excellent cooperation” between Islamabad and Trump’s new administration. This marks a shift from recent years, where US-Pakistan security collaboration had diminished following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan. Regional security concerns: The Islamic State Khorasan, IS’s regional affiliate, has been linked to several high-profile international attacks, including the March 2024 Moscow concert hall bombing that killed over 140 people and the deadly attack in Iran last year. The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations.

The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations. Pakistan’s domestic threats: IS-K has expanded its reach beyond Afghanistan, increasingly targeting Pakistani cities and security forces. Meanwhile, the TTP has launched numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan’s tribal regions. The government has struggled to contain these threats, making counterterrorism cooperation with the US a strategic necessity.

Between the lines



What’s next



US-Pakistan relations: If this counterterrorism cooperation continues, it could lead to a thaw in relations between the two countries, potentially reviving security assistance programs that had been cut in recent years. The US may also push Pakistan to do more against militant safe havens within its borders.

If this counterterrorism cooperation continues, it could lead to a thaw in relations between the two countries, potentially reviving security assistance programs that had been cut in recent years. The US may also push Pakistan to do more against militant safe havens within its borders. Impact on Pakistan’s security landscape: The arrest of Sharifullah may disrupt IS-K’s operational capabilities in the short term, but the group remains a potent threat. Pakistan will need to step up intelligence-sharing and military operations to prevent retaliatory attacks from IS-K and TTP.

The arrest of Sharifullah may disrupt IS-K’s operational capabilities in the short term, but the group remains a potent threat. Pakistan will need to step up intelligence-sharing and military operations to prevent retaliatory attacks from IS-K and TTP. Broader implications for Afghanistan: This arrest further highlights Afghanistan’s growing role as a sanctuary for international terrorist networks. The Taliban’s ability (or unwillingness) to suppress IS-K will be a key issue for regional stability.

Pakistani security forces played a crucial role in capturing Mohammad Sharifullah , a top commander of the Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K), who was allegedly responsible for the devastating suicide bombing outside Kabul airport in August 2021. The attack, which occurred during the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan, killed 13 US service members and 170 Afghan civilians.President Donald Trump, in his first address to Congress since his return to the White House, announced that Pakistan had helped arrest “the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity.” While he did not provide details about the operation, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later confirmed that Sharifullah was apprehended in a counterterrorism raid along the Pakistan-Afghan border.Pakistan’s involvement in this high-profile counterterrorism operation could significantly reshape its relationship with the US.By assisting in Sharifullah’s arrest, Pakistan is signaling its willingness to re-engage with Washington on security matters.This move comes as Pakistan faces increasing pressure from militant groups, including IS-K and the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which have intensified attacks within the country.The operation could help Islamabad gain favor with the US, potentially unlocking military and economic assistance at a time when Pakistan is grappling with financial instability.Pakistan’s decision to assist in Sharifullah’s arrest is not just about counterterrorism—it is also about geopolitics. The country’s strategic importance has waned since the US and Nato withdrawal from Afghanistan, but this operation could help Islamabad regain relevance in Washington’s security calculus.South Asia expert Michael Kugelman noted that Pakistan is trying to “leverage US concerns about terror in Afghanistan and pitch a renewed security partnership.”At the same time, Pakistan’s cooperation might be seen as a balancing act. Islamabad has maintained complex ties with the Afghan Taliban, and it remains to be seen how Kabul will react to this development.The US justice department has charged Sharifullah with ""providing and conspiring to provide material support and resources"" to the group.""He confessed. This was the planner of that bombing,"" White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said in an interview with Fox News.FBI director Kash Patel said Sharifullah was in US custody, in a post on X alongside a picture of agents standing in front of the plane that he was due to arrive on.""That time you delivered the sword of justice for the American people- thank you for your incredible leadership @AGPamBondi and @JohnRatcliffe.
