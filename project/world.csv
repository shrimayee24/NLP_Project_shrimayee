‘Local support’ for terrorists under scrutiny in Jammu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jammu/local-support-for-terrorists-under-scrutiny-in-jammu/articleshow/112089060.cms,"J&K Attacks: PM Modi Orders Big Action Against Terrorists After High-Level Meeting | Reasi | Jammu

JAMMU: They were awakened by knocks at their doors. Policemen armed with automatic rifles surrounded their homes, bundled them into vehicles, and sped away through the forest tracks in their villages, which are about 25km apart and 110km southeast of Jammu city.These arrests added weight to suspicions of local support in the resurgence of terrorist activities in the Jammu zone of J&K, raising questions about the region’s security dynamics and the broader socio-political underpinnings.Police released a stripped-down statement. “Through meticulous investigation, two over ground workers (OGWs) have been identified and arrested for supporting terrorism-related activities. They are Layaqat Ali, alias Pawu, son of Gammi, from Ward No. 07, Kalna Dhanu Parole, Billawar, Kathua, and Mool Raj, alias Jenju, son of Uttam Chand, from Bowli Mohalla, Malhar, also in Kathua district.”Ali and Raj are residents of sleepy hamlets deep in the Pir Panjal range that slices through J&K — Jammu to the south and Kashmir valley to the north. Residents live miles apart. Cell and internet service is inconsistent — or non-existent. Here, nightly knocks could either mean terrorist, police, or a cousin who lost his cow in the woods.The two men’s villages are within range of Badnota, where an ambush on a two-truck patrol claimed the lives of five soldiers from 22 Garhwal Rifles on July 8. From vantage points, the terrorists fired bullets downrange when the trucks were slowly negotiating a bend on Machedi-Kindli-Malhar road.The area falls under the Machedi forest belt — a remote and rugged landscape dotted with deep gorges, thick foliage, and mountain caves, providing ample cover for terrorists operating in small groups. In this treacherous terrain,security forces have struggled to neutralise the threat effectively, despite extensive seek-and-kill operations involving drones, helicopters, and military dogs.The situation raises critical questions. How do terrorists, presumed to be from Pakistan, manage to launch lethal attacks and evade capture in this challenging landscape? Do they have a local support system in place, or are they using coercion — gunpoint intimidation — and financial incentives to gain the support of impoverished villagers?Authorities have long claimed that local support is crucial for these Pakistani terrorists , who lack familiarity with the lay of the land. “Foreign terrorists, unfamiliar with the topography and security layout, cannot operate effectively without local guidance,” said a retired Army officer. “They can’t move a step outside of their hideout. But they struck at specific places of their choice (in recent attacks), which is not possible without local support and guidance.”According to security sources, more than 60 foreign terrorists, trained in jungle warfare, are active in small groups within the Jammu region. These groups are equipped with advanced technology, including iridium satellite phones and thermal imagery, and use high-end weapons like the American M4 carbine.Their capacity to coordinate attacks poses a significant challenge for security forces, evidenced by the successful ambushes and subsequent escapes, using dense foliage and darkness to their advantage. Recent attacks, such as the July 8 ambush on a military patrol, demonstrate the terrorists’ ability to strike specific targets with precision, indicating strong local knowledge.Ali and Raj were arrested for allegedly aiding the terrorists in hiding and navigating the area undetected. Earlier, police had arrested four men, including Showket Ali, who allegedly provided food, shelter, and WiFi access to three terrorists before the July 15 attack in Desa forest of Doda district, which left four soldiers dead.“Foreign terrorists might be luring locals with huge sums of money to work for them as OGWs,” said the retired Army officer. “They offer them a sense of comfort and safety in exchange for logistical support and intelligence.”On June 19, police arrested a 45-year-old man named Hakam Din, alleged to be an OGW and prime suspect in guiding and sheltering the group of suspected Pakistani gunmen who attacked a bus carrying pilgrims in Reasi district on June 9, resulting in the deaths of nine people. Din allegedly received Rs 6,000 for his assistance, which police claimed to have found in his possession.The timing of the attacks, often occurring in isolated areas and at night, further suggested a dependence on local support. “Without using GPS or other navigation aids to avoid detection, these terrorists need locals to guide them,” a security source said. Recent terrorist strikes, including the Bhangri shootout and the Chatergalla mountain pass attack, highlighted the dependency of terrorists on local operatives .In 2023, security agencies arrested 291 people associated with terrorist groups, emphasising the widespread threat of local support. J&K DGP RR Swain reported the dismantling of 89 terrorist modules, with 78 in Kashmir and 11 in Jammu. Despite these efforts, the surge in attacks this summer has raised concerns about the effectiveness of current security measures.Authorities have warned people against aiding terrorists, while also urging locals to report any “suspicious movement” in their area. Locals denied any involvement with terrorists. One villager, who preferred to remain anonymous, offered a perspective on their predicament soon after the Reasi pilgrim bus attack: “What do you do when a jihadi points an AK-47 at your head and demands food? Yield or fight back? Inform police and risk retaliation?”The escalation in terrorism-related violence has concerned locals in upper reaches, who demanded the strengthening of village defence groups (VDGs) to tackle threats. In places like Kralaan village of Doda, VDGs are assisting security forces in the counteroffensive.The key to intelligence gathering is surveillance, stakeouts, and stealth — essential for telling the bad guys from the good. However, the recent string of attacks and fatalities have raised concerns about intelligence failures.Historically, the nomadic Gujjar-Bakerwal community has been a vital intelligence source for security agencies. However, recent events have strained this relationship. The granting of scheduled tribe status to the Paharis and the deaths of three community members in Army custody last winter have caused a sense of betrayal among some Bakerwal members.Nevertheless, community leaders reaffirm their patriotism. “Our community has always supported the Army,” said Adil Khan, a Bakerwal. “We reciprocate the Army’s assistance with our cooperation.”Advocate Anwer Choudhary echoed this sentiment, stressing that the community remains focused on their safety and well-being rather than reservation issues.The attacks are particularly concerning, with the Supreme Court setting a deadline of Sept 30 for the upcoming assembly elections in J&K. Is the surge in terrorist activities a deliberate attempt to derail the democratic process? Official sources said the attacks are designed to project a sense of dominance by the terrorists despite the enhanced security grid in the region.","Layaqat Ali, alias Pawu, from Ward No. 07, Kalna Dhanu Parole, Billawar, Kathua, and Mool Raj, alias Jenju, son of Uttam Chand, from Bowli Mohalla, Malhar, also in Kathua district.

She revealed that she had made false rape allegations out of anger after a disagreement with the accused.The court noted that while women are given special privileges and protection under the law, these provisions should not be exploited for ulterior motives or to settle scores, a trend that is becoming increasingly common in society.It further stressed that false rape allegations not only ruin the life of the accused but also harm the reputation and social standing of their family members.""The men of our country have equal rights and protection under the law as enshrined in the Constitution, however, special privilege is given to women.

While the Quad summit which India was hoping to host in January has been inordinately delayed, the ministers are expected to explore the possibility of having the same on the margins of the UNGA in September.According to government sources, PM Narendra Modi won’t mind having the summit in New York and while the US and Australia are also keen, there’s still doubt about whether Japanese PM Fumio Kishida will be able to make it as the UNGA 2024 clashes with the presidential election for Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The election as of now is expected to take place either on September 20 or 27.Amid renewed China-Philippines tensions, theQuad meeting on Monday will likely see a reiteration of the 4 democracies’ joint vision of keeping the Indo-Pacific stable and secure, free from intimidation and coercion, and where sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected. The Russia-Ukraine war is also expected to figure in the meeting with the ministers likely to focus on its humanitarian consequences.Despite India’s initial reluctance to include the war in Quad’s agenda, concerns over the global food security situation have seen the grouping focus on the implications of Russia’s actions in Ukraine in a big way. Apart from the US, Japan and Australia are also likely to appreciate Modi’s decision to visit Ukraine next month. The last foreign ministers’ meeting on the margins of the UNGA in 2023 saw the participants mourning in a joint statement the “terrible and tragic humanitarian consequences” of the war in Ukraine and underscoring the need for a “comprehensive, just, and lasting peace” in accordance with international law, consistent with the principles of the UN Charter. In the context of the Ukraine war, Quad has also described the threat of use of nuclear weapons as unacceptable.The ministers will also review cooperation on Quad initiatives for the Indo-Pacific announced during the 2023 Hiroshima summit last year, including in climate change, clean energy supply chains, and infrastructure.","The leaders met in Tokyo ahead of the Quad foreign ministers’ meeting on Monday.

Tragic Rocket Strike in Golan Heights Kills 11 Children; Netanyahu Vows Severe Reprisal Against Hezbollah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/at-least-9-killed-and-several-injured-after-rocket-barrage-from-lebanon-struck-israel-annexed-golan-heights-hezbollah/articleshow/112070896.cms,"Majdal Shams Attack: Rocket Kills At Least 10 At A Football Pitch In Israeli-Occupied Golan Heights

A rocket strike on a soccer field in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights killed at least 11 children and teens on Saturday, according to Israeli authorities. This marks the deadliest attack on an Israeli target along the northern border since the conflict with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah reignited.Israel has blamed Hezbollah for the deadly strike in Majdal Shams, but Hezbollah quickly denied any involvement.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a stern warning, saying that Hezbollah ""will pay a heavy price for this attack, one that it has not paid so far.""Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesman for the Israeli military, confirmed the attack as the deadliest on Israeli civilians since the Hamas assault on October 7, which ignited the ongoing war in Gaza. Hagari reported that 20 others were wounded in the rocket strike.Foreign Minister Israel Katz declared on Israeli Channel 12, ""There is no doubt that Hezbollah has crossed all the red lines here, and the response will reflect that. We are nearing the moment in which we face an all-out war.""In a rare move, Hezbollah's chief spokesman, Mohammed Afif, categorically denied the group's involvement in the attack on Majdal Shams, calling it an unusual statement for the militant organization.The rocket strike, which occurred just before sunset, followed earlier cross-border violence on the same day. Hezbollah reported the deaths of three of its fighters, without specifying the location. In response, the Israeli air force targeted a Hezbollah arms depot in Kfar Kila, a border village, claiming militants were present at the time.Hezbollah stated that its fighters conducted ten different attacks using rockets and explosive drones against Israeli military posts, including targeting the army command of the Haramoun Brigade in Maaleh Golani with Katyusha rockets and a short-range Falaq rocket.The incident prompted Netanyahu, who was visiting the United States, to cut his trip short. His office announced he would convene the security Cabinet upon his return.Far-right members of Netanyahu's government have called for a severe response against Hezbollah. However, an all-out war with Hezbollah, a group possessing far greater firepower than Hamas, would strain the Israeli military, which has been engaged in nearly ten months of conflict in Gaza.Footage aired on Israeli Channel 12 showed a significant explosion in Majdal Shams, a Druze town in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed in 1981. Some Druze in the area hold Israeli citizenship, while others maintain sympathies for Syria. Over the years, their ties with Israeli society have grown.Ha'il Mahmoud, a resident, recounted to Channel 12 that children were playing soccer when the rocket struck. A siren was heard just seconds before the impact, but there was no time to seek shelter.Jihan Sfadi, the principal of an elementary school, confirmed that five students were among the dead. ""The situation here is very difficult. Parents are crying, people are screaming outside. No one can digest what has happened,"" she said.The Israeli military's analysis indicated that the rocket was launched from an area north of Chebaa in southern Lebanon .The White House National Security Council issued a statement expressing support for efforts to end the attacks along the Blue Line, emphasizing unwavering support for Israel's security against Iranian-backed terrorist groups, including Hezbollah.Lebanon's government called for an immediate cessation of hostilities on all fronts and condemned all attacks on civilians, without specifically mentioning the incident in Majdal Shams.The exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah has intensified since October 8, a day after Hamas militants launched an attack on southern Israel. In recent weeks, the conflict along the Lebanon-Israel border has escalated, with Israeli airstrikes and Hezbollah's rocket and drone attacks reaching deeper into each other's territories.As Israel and Hamas consider a ceasefire proposal to end the nearly ten-month war in Gaza, the situation remains volatile. The ongoing conflict has resulted in over 39,000 deaths in Gaza, according to local health authorities, and significant casualties on both sides of the border with Lebanon.","A rocket strike on a soccer field in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights killed at least 11 children and teens.

Impact and international reactions

Campaign dynamics

Venezuelans anxiously awaited the results of Sunday’s pivotal presidential election, which could signal an end to 25 years of single-party rule. As polls remained open more than three hours past the official closing time, the uncertainty heightened tension across the nation.President Nicolás Maduro , seeking a third term, faced an unexpected challenger: Edmundo González , a retired diplomat who emerged as a late stand-in for opposition leader María Corina Machado .Machado, barred from the race by the Maduro-controlled Supreme Court, saw González as her surrogate in a last-ditch effort to unseat the incumbent.Opposition supporters, buoyed by exit polls showing a strong lead for González, celebrated early victories at voting centers in Caracas. Despite Venezuelan law prohibiting exit polls, celebratory scenes unfolded with chants of “Freedom! Freedom!” echoing through the streets. Merling Fernández, a 31-year-old bank employee, expressed elation at what she perceived as a landslide win for González. “This is the path toward a new Venezuela,” Fernández said, overwhelmed with emotion.However, Maduro's campaign remained defiant. Campaign chief Jorge Rodríguez dismissed the early jubilation, stressing the need for official results. “We can’t give results, but we can show face,” Rodríguez said.Polls, originally set to close at 6 p.m., continued operating past the deadline at some centers, leading to calls from the opposition for the National Electoral Council to begin ballot counting. The delay fueled skepticism about the fairness of the process.In Caracas, voters lined up before dawn, preparing for long waits. Judith Cantilla, 52, voiced hope for change, emphasizing the need for better jobs and healthcare. “For me, change in Venezuela means jobs, security, and good pay for essential workers,” Cantilla said.The election's outcome is poised to influence not only Venezuela but also the broader Americas, with many contemplating emigration depending on the result. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris voiced support for Venezuelan voters, underscoring the importance of respecting their decision. “The United States stands with the people of Venezuela,” Harris stated on X.Maduro’s son, Nicolas Maduro Guerra, projected confidence in a victory for the ruling party. Meanwhile, González called for a peaceful transition and urged the armed forces to honor the people’s choice.Venezuela’s economic crisis and mass migration were focal points of the campaign. Maduro’s pitch included stories of economic recovery and stable currency, but many Venezuelans have seen little improvement. González and Machado's campaign promised to address the vast inequalities and reverse the economic decline.González, speaking after voting, emphasized his commitment to transformative change. “We will change hatred for love, poverty for progress, and corruption for honesty,” he declared.As Venezuelans wait for the official results, the election’s potential to reshape the nation’s future remains a subject of intense anticipation and concern.","Venezuelans anxiously awaited the results of Sunday’s pivotal presidential election.

'Scared of being booed!': Prince Harry's wife Meghan Markle has become 'British-phobic',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/scared-of-being-booed-prince-harrys-wife-meghan-markle-has-become-british-phobic/articleshow/112093316.cms,"Prince Harry 's wife and Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle has developed a phobia of Britain. A royal expert said that Meghan's reluctance to visit the UK is not due to concerns about her safety, but rather because she believes she would not receive a warm welcome from the British public.In a recent ITV documentary titled Tabloids on Trial, which focused on his battle with the British press, Prince Harry expressed his unwillingness to bring his wife to the country out of fear that she might become a victim of an acid or knife attack inspired by negative press coverage.However, the royal expert dismissed these concerns to GB News, saying, ""This is not about knives. This is not about acid. This is about Meghan's fear of booing.""""I think she is petrified that the great British public will vocalise their dislike of her. And I actually think now she's become quite Britain-phobic ,"" he added.The royal expert suggested that Meghan, being a ""California girl,"" has never truly fit into the British upper crust that Prince Harry is accustomed to. He argued that there was no valid reason for her absence from the Coronation, as the security measures in place should have been sufficient.""I don't think she actually likes this country because of all the negative associations she has with it from her time living here. I don't think she's ever really fit into this country anyway,"" the royal expert said adding, ""She's a California girl, she's not really part of that British upper crust that Prince Harry enjoys so much.""""I just don't think she really wants to come down here because there was no reason she couldn't have come for the Coronation,"" the expert said while arguing, ""The security was fine for the wife of the President. It should have been fine for the wife of Prince Harry.""The spokesperson also criticised Prince Harry for not bringing his children to visit his father, King Charles III, following his cancer diagnosis, noting that the monarch has only seen Lilibet once and Archie a handful of times.Since their relocation to California in 2020, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have rarely visited the UK together. The Duke of Sussex last visited in May for the Invictus Games, without his wife accompanying him.In the ITV interview, Prince Harry shared his concerns about the impact of media intrusion on his life, saying, ""All it takes is one lone actor, one person who reads this stuff to act on what they have read. And whether it's a knife or acid, whatever it is, and these are things that are of genuine concern for me. It's one of the reasons why I won't bring my wife back to this country.""","A royal expert said that Meghan's reluctance to visit the UK is not due to concerns about her safety, but rather because she believes she would not receive a warm welcome. Prince Harry expressed his unwillingness to bring his wife to the country out of fear that she might become a victim of an acid or knife attack inspired by negative press coverage.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112093644,imgsize-698665,width-400,resizemode-4/112093644.jpg"

Rescue details

An Edmond couple was miraculously rescue d around 1 am on Friday after disappearing while scuba diving off the coast of Texas, US. The couple, who had been feared lost at sea by their loved ones, were found alive in the Gulf of Mexico following a 36-hour search, according to Oklahoma news.Nathan and Kim Maker were last seen scuba diving with a group on Wednesday morning when a storm hit, causing chaos among the divers.According to Charles Owen, Nathan’s uncle, the couple had surfaced and were preparing to return to the boat when a large swell engulfed them.“There was a storm moving in, and the divers had all surfaced and were preparing to get back on the boat,” Owen explained. “As the 16 got in, in the meantime, the swell came in and engulfed all of them,” as per Oklahoma news.Despite taking precautions and inflating their safety devices, the storm proved too powerful, and Nathan and Kim were swept away. The search covered 1,656 square miles and lasted approximately 36 hours . Coast Guard officials were close to calling off the search when a plane made a final pass outside the designated search grid.“This plane happened to be in the air last night making its last run outside the grid, and Nathan and Kim had their diving flashlights and were signaling SOS to the plane,” Owen said. The Coast Guard aircraft spotted the flashing lights from the couple’s diving flashlights, leading rescue boats to their location.Video footage from a Coast Guard aircraft showed two figures around 20 miles offshore in the Gulf of Mexico early Friday morning. These figures were identified as Nathan and Kim Maker. The couple was found dehydrated, with jellyfish stings, and Kim had an infection, while Nathan was near a diabetic coma. They had also been swimming periodically to maintain their body temperature.“We’d already practically given up hope,” Owen said, reflecting the family’s relief and gratitude for the miraculous rescue. “This miracle was performed by the Coast Guard at God’s direction,” according to Oklahoma news.The rescue operation was a collaborative effort involving multiple Coast Guard units. Sector Corpus Christi received the initial notification on Wednesday afternoon, reporting the couple’s disappearance in unfavorable weather conditions. Air Station Corpus Christi deployed MH-65 Dolphin helicopters and HC-144 Ocean Sentry aircraft, while Station Port O’Connor dispatched a 45-foot Response boat medium. The Coast Guard Cutter Edgar Culbertson was also directed to assist.The Ocean Sentry aircraft crew spotted the flashing light in the water, which led to the divers’ location. The couple was transported to Coast Guard Station Freeport and reported to be in stable condition.Owen expressed profound gratitude for the community’s support and prayers. “We thank everybody for their concerns and their prayers,” he said. Nathan and Kim are currently hospitalized but in stable condition, and Owen hopes they can return home soon.","Nathan and Kim Maker were last seen scuba diving with a group on Wednesday morning when a storm hit, causing chaos among the divers.

Shift in campaign focus following Biden’s withdrawal

Dig at Harris’ name

'Kamala is Biden’s border czar'

Former President Donald Trump escalated his criticism of Kamala Harris on Saturday calling her a “bum” and accused her of failing in her role as Vice President. “She was a bum three weeks ago. She was a bum, a failed vice president ,” Trump said.In his first public appearance without an ear bandage since surviving an assassination attempt, Trump addressed a gathering at the Believers Summit in West Palm Beach, Florida, where he also portrayed Harris as a proponent of extreme left-wing policies and accused her of wanting to impose ""crazy San Francisco liberal values"" on the nation, citing her potential judicial appointments as a means to enforce these views nationwide.""Kamala Harris will appoint hundreds of extreme far-left judges to forcibly impose crazy San Francisco liberal values on Americans,"" Trump said.This speech marked Trump's second major campaign appearance since President Joe Biden's unexpected decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race earlier this week. The shift in the race dynamics led Trump to refocus his criticisms from Biden to Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee.The former president also declared Harris “worse than Joe Biden and, in a true sense, much more liberal.”Trump continued to take digs at President Biden, saying, ""Biden didn't want to do what he did. He said, 'I will never go out, I will never ever go out.' Two days later, 'I'm proud to go out.' Because the fascists threatened him with the 25th Amendment. They said we can do it the nice way or we can do it the hard way, Joe. That's what happened, I know. I know as many people on that side as I know on our side. But that's what happened. And now they are trying to make him a brave hero. 'He is so brave.'Trump also took aim at Biden’s recent speech regarding his decision to withdraw. ""The other night he made a speech. Look, I am not going to look into it, I am going to give people credit or no credit. It was horrible,"" Trump remarked, questioning the sincerity and quality of Biden’s address.The Republican presidential nominee also took jabs at Harris’ name, which he has been repeatedly accused of fumbling on purpose.“And by the way, there are numerous ways of saying her name. They were explaining to me, ‘You can say Comma-la, you can say Kah-mala,'” Trump said. He consistently uses the latter, which is incorrect.“I said, ‘Don’t worry about it. It doesn’t matter what I say,'” he continued. “I couldn’t care less if I mispronounce it.”Trump’s speech continued his campaign’s pattern of attacking Harris on immigration issues, despite her role not encompassing overall border policy. He described her as President Biden’s “border czar,” a designation not officially assigned but used by Republicans to criticize her handling of migration issues, reported the Washington Post.Trump's speech, aimed at a predominantly Christian audience, was notable for its direct assault on Harris's policies and beliefs. He claimed that Harris would expand the Supreme Court with “hard-core Marxists” to undermine the Constitution and religious freedoms. Trump's rhetoric also included controversial statements about abortion rights, accusing Harris of supporting extreme late-term abortions—a claim that is not supported by current laws or Harris’s actual policy positions.In addition to his abortion comments, Trump criticized Harris for her handling of immigration, broadly characterizing immigrants in a negative light and alleging without evidence that Harris and Democrats were encouraging illegal border crossings to increase voter rolls.Trump also took aim at Harris’s response to the Israel-Palestine conflict, accusing her of being “hostile to Americans of faith” and failing to support Israel adequately. He used his recent meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago estate to bolster his pro-Israel stance and further criticize Harris.James Singer, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, condemned Trump's remarks as offensive and misleading. “Trump went on and on and on, and generally sounded like someone you wouldn’t want to sit near at a restaurant—let alone be president of the United States,” Singer said in a statement.",'Kamala is Biden’s border czar' 'She was a bum three weeks ago' 'I couldn’t care less if I mispronounce it’ 'She will appoint hundreds of extreme far-left judges to forcibly impose crazy San Francisco liberal values',"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112058338,imgsize-3825983,width-400,resizemode-4/112058338.jpg"

A UAE court has jailed 57 Bangladeshi citizens to lengthy prison terms for protesting against the Sheikh Hasina government over the controversial quota decision .The Bangladeshi citizens were jailed as unauthorised protests are banned in the Gulf country.Commenting on the case, Amnesty International 's UAE researcher Devin Kenney said it was ""the second mass trial in the UAE this month, with dozens of people sentenced to huge prison terms literally overnight, on charges involving no element of violence"".In a statement to news agency AFP, Kenney said the UAE's ""extreme reaction to the mere existence of a public protest on Emirati soil shows that the state places great priority on suppressing any manifestation of dissent in the country.""Meanwhile, a Bangladeshi student leader on Monday called for a 48-hour halt to the protest against the quota decision, which embroiled the nation in deadly clashes resulting in the death of over 100 people.""We are suspending the shutdown protests for 48 hours,"" Nahid Islam, the top leader of the main protest organiser Students Against Discrimination, told news agency AFP. Nahid Islam demanded the government to ""withdraw the curfew, restore the internet and stop targeting thestudent protesters "" in the halt period.In what could be deciphered as a sign of ease, the halt comes a day after the Bangladesh Supreme Court scaled down the controversial quota decision of the Sheikh Hasina government that facilitated 30 per cent reservation in government jobs to descendants of 1971 war heroes, who fought for the Independent against Pakistani regime.As the situation appears to head towards normalcy, the Bangladesh police have arrested more than 500 people, including some opposition leaders, over days of clashes in the capital Dhaka.""At least 532 people have been arrested over the violence,"" Dhaka Metropolitan Police spokesman Faruk Hossain.""They include some BNP leaders,"" he added, referring to the opposition Bangladesh National Party.After days of deadly violence, normalcy returned to Bangladesh on Wednesday as factories, offices, and banks reopened following the easing of a nationwide curfew enforced by the army.

However, social media platforms remained suspended in the wake of student-led protests that turned violent last week.Despite the easing of restrictions, Zunaid Ahmed Palak, a junior technology minister, informed reporters that ""For now, all social media will remain shut,"" indicating that the government is still cautious about the potential for further unrest.","UAE court jails 57 Bangladeshi citizens to lengthy prison terms for protesting against the Sheikh Hasina government over the controversial quota decision.

Trump assassination attempt timeline: Text messages reveal key details of how Thomas Crooks was often a step ahead of secret service,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-assassination-attempt-timeline-text-messages-reveal-key-details-of-how-thomas-crooks-was-often-a-step-ahead-of-secret-service/articleshow/112093040.cms,"The timeline

Security lapses and missteps

Crooks’ actions being probed

In a dramatic sequence of events on July 13, 2024, former President Donald Trump narrowly escaped an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The details, emerging from text messages and surveillance reports, reveal a troubling series of security lapses and miscommunications.Around 4:19 pm, a local countersniper, who was part of the broader security detail, texted his colleagues to notify them that his shift was ending.“Guys I am out. Be safe,” he texted to a group of colleagues.As he exited his post on the second floor of a warehouse overlooking the rally site, he observed a young man with long, stringy hair sitting on a picnic table outside the fenced area of the Butler Fair Show grounds. The countersniper texted his colleagues at 4:26 pm about the person, noting that he might have seen him with his rifle and might pose a threat, reported NYT.The person, later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Crooks from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, aroused suspicion.By 5:10 pm, Crooks had moved closer to the warehouse where the countersnipers were stationed. One of the countersnipers took photographs of Crooks and sent them in a group chat, according to a law enforcement after-action report, advising that the Secret Service should be alerted. Despite these warnings, the security response failed to adequately address the threat.At 5:38 pm, text messages revealed that Crooks had been seen using a range finder to survey the stage area, prompting further concern. However, due to a shortage of volunteers and a lack of communication, the Secret Service and local law enforcement struggled to keep up with Crooks' movements. “Kid learning around building we are in. AGR I believe it is. I did see him with a range finder looking towards stage. FYI. If you wanna notify SS snipers to look out. I lost sight of him,” the text read, as reported by NYT.Crooks had been scouting the rally site even before the Secret Service conducted their first walk-through on July 8. He used a drone to survey the area and had researched past assassinations, including that of President John F Kennedy. On the day of the rally, he purchased ammunition and a ladder, which he later used to gain access to a roof about 400 feet from Trump’s podium.As Trump took the stage at 6:03 pm, rally attendees noticed Crooks on the roof. Crooks fired his first shot at 6:11 pm, narrowly missing Trump, who dived to the ground. Secret Service agents responded swiftly, returning fire and killing Crooks.Investigators are piecing together Crooks' motivations and actions leading up to the attempt. They found evidence of a plan involving rudimentary bombs and a fixation on high-profile figures. Despite the extensive security presence, the series of miscommunications and lapses allowed Crooks to get dangerously close to his target.Taken together, the text messages have revealed a comprehensive account of the hours leading up to the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. These messages indicate that the gunman attracted police suspicion more than 90 minutes before the shooting—significantly earlier than the previously reported 60-minute window discussed in congressional hearings.The messages also add to the evidence that the would-be assassin was often one step ahead of security forces, and in particular the Secret Service.Despite the presence of countersnipers tasked with monitoring the rally, Crooks managed to observe them from his vantage point. After the attack, confusion persisted among police officers about how Crooks executed his plan. ""So, on TV, they’re saying Trump was shot at, and he got hit, but I don’t believe that,"" one officer was heard saying on body-worn camera footage 17 minutes after the shooting.Authorities are still investigating Crooks’ motivations and his preparatory actions. Evidence from his personal devices and interviews with investigators have shed light on his activities. Crooks had legally acquired an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle from his father in October 2013.In the lead-up to the attack, he received packages containing fertilizer pellets and radio devices, which he used to construct rudimentary bombs—two of which were found in his vehicle and another in his home.Crooks' online searches revealed a fixation on high-profile figures, including FBI Director Christopher Wray, Attorney General Merrick Garland, President Joe Biden, and Trump. He also researched ""major depressive disorder.""Following the announcement of Trump's rally in Butler on July 3, Crooks focused his attention on the event and historical assassinations. On July 6, he searched for ""How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?"" and visited the farm show grounds the following day, where he spent about 20 minutes scouting the location. He also registered to attend the rally.The Secret Service conducted their first walk-through of the site on July 8, joined by local and state law enforcement agencies. However, they decided to exclude the AGR warehouse complex—including Building No. 6, which Crooks later utilized—from their inner security perimeter. This oversight allowed Crooks to approach the building without passing through security screening.The confusion over who was responsible for monitoring the roof persists. Kimberly A Cheatle, then the director of the Secret Service, admitted before a House committee that she was unaware of the assigned duties for roof security. Cheatle resigned the following day, adding to the ongoing scrutiny of the security failures that nearly led to a catastrophic event.","Thomas Crooks, 20, shot and killed former President Donald Trump on July 13, 2024.

How JD Vance's early missteps shake confidence in Trump campaign,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-jd-vances-early-missteps-shake-confidence-in-trump-campaign/articleshow/112092874.cms,"Unearthed remarks stir controversy

Awkward public appearances

Trump's resilient campaign momentum

Criticism from unexpected allies

Campaign's public support for Vance

Impact on female voters

Digital era amplifies missteps

Future outlook for the Trump-Vance ticket

The choice of Senator JD Vance as former President Donald Trump’s running mate initially signaled a campaign brimming with confidence and looking to solidify Trump’s legacy beyond a second term. Yet, in less than two weeks, Vance’s candidacy has faced significant hurdles, shaking the sense of invulnerability that had surrounded the Trump campaign.A slew of years-old quotes, videos, and audio clips, recently unearthed by Democrats and the media, have emerged, casting a shadow over the campaign’s efforts to appeal to women, voters of color, and blue-collar voters—key demographics Vance was supposed to win over, as reported by NYT.His past remarks, which include derogatory comments about “childless cat ladies,” advocating for a “federal response” to stop abortions in Democratic states, and suggesting higher taxes for childless Americans, have incited widespread criticism. Attempts by Vance to clarify these statements have only added fuel to the fire, exemplified by a clip where he stressed that he did not intend to insult cats: “I’ve got nothing against cats,” he said.Vance’s initial public appearances have not helped his cause. During a rally in Middletown, Ohio, he awkwardly tried to preempt criticism by joking that his preference for Diet Mountain Dew could be deemed racist, assuring the audience that “Diet Mountain Dew is good.”These issues have emerged after a dramatic period for Trump, who survived an assassination attempt and managed to unify the Republican Party and even some skeptics. The Republican National Convention, which began with calls for national unity, saw the Trump-Vance ticket gain momentum and an increased lead in the polls.However, this success has brought unintended consequences. Vance was supposed to campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris. Instead, the Republican surge led to President Joe Biden withdrawing from the race, elevating Harris and energizing Democratic support. This shift left Vance without a clear opponent, struggling under the national spotlight.Criticism has come from unexpected quarters as well. Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports and a prominent figure in the Trump movement, questioned Vance’s policies: “You want me to pay more taxes to take care of other people’s kids? We sure this dude is a Republican? Sounds like a moron,” quoted by NYT as saying.Publicly, the Trump campaign has stood by Vance. Campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung dismissed the criticism as “liberal talking points” and reiterated their determination to defeat Harris. However, Vance’s controversial comments have particularly resonated with women, a group Trump has long struggled to win over.The addition of Vance to the ticket has mobilized new opponents, including actress Jennifer Aniston, who criticized his perceived denigration of childless women. The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page lambasted Vance’s debut, comparing his remarks to Hillary Clinton’s infamous “basket of deplorables” comment in 2016.Supporters argue that the criticism is overblown, noting that Vance suggested lowering taxes for families with children rather than raising them for childless Americans. On SiriusXM’s “The Megyn Kelly Show,” Vance defended his stance, saying, “I’m proud to stand up for parents...I want to fight for your interests.”Vance has also faced backlash for a 2021 proposal to give parents more voting power and for comments on conservative podcasts that included antisemitic and racial stereotypes. His spokesperson clarified that Vance agrees with Trump that states should set their own abortion policies, dismissing the attacks as distractions.In today’s digital age, Vance’s comments have spread rapidly across social media, resonating beyond the internet. Democrats have mocked his proposals as “weird,” with Senators Brian Schatz and Chris Murphy recording a video ridiculing the idea of giving parents more votes.The Harris campaign has managed to maintain the focus on her presidential bid, successfully diverting attention from Trump. Harris aides revealed that many of the old videos circulating were unearthed by their campaign and the Democratic National Committee. They have relished defining Vance before he can establish himself.While some argue that any Trump running mate would face similar scrutiny, the Harris campaign is satisfied with the damage done to Vance.","Senator JD Vance's comments about 'childless cat ladies' and higher taxes for childless Americans have incited widespread criticism.

While acknowledging the attacks, Vance did not explicitly condemn them.Instead, he expressed his deep love and admiration for his wife, stating, ""Look, I love my wife so much. I love her because she's who she is.""""Obviously, she's not a white person, and we've been accused — attacked — by some white supremacists over that,"" said Vance. He then shifted the focus to his wife's qualities, emphasizing, ""But I just — I love Usha. She's such a good mom, she's such a brilliant lawyer and I'm so proud of her.""The Ohio senator, who faced criticism in 2021 for targeting ""childless"" Democrats in a comment he later described as ""sarcastic,"" also mentioned that his wife's experiences have provided him with insight into the challenges faced by working families in America.However, Vance's response to the white supremacist attacks has drawn criticism from several people on social media.

And that’s not a dig at him just because I’m a racist or something. But who is this guy really?
