After the recent tensions over the Khalistan separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun murder plot, the Biden administration looked to sign off on a positive note with India as outgoing ambassador Eric Garcetti Thursday welcomed the conclusion of the Indian probe into the murder-for-hire case, saying the investigation delivered 2 of the things that the US sought – accountability and systemic reforms .Garcetti told TOI in an interview that while the probe was not an end in itself, and the US would look forward to more steps, the outcome helped prove wrong the sceptics who believed there’s no way India and the United States would be able to navigate this issue and that what India was doing was mere “window dressing”.The ambassador admitted that Trump’s tariff threat could undermine the positive agenda of the relationship, but expressed confidence the relationship would continue to grow, saying he saw Trump’s tariff focus as an invitation for dialogue on the issue, and not as a threat to start a trade war.“My assessment is it’s ( Pannun probe ) a really positive first step. We welcome it. It delivered what the private interactions I had with Indian officials promised. We said changes should be made to ensure this doesn’t happen again and people should be held accountable. It’s not the destination though. The report would be first to say that. It says it’s recommending a process for prosecution. And just like in our system, facts come out and things happen. But this is substantive. It moves the ball forward and we look forward to steps in the future,"" said Garcetti, when asked about the outcome of the probe which suggested the plot might have been a ‘lone wolf’ operation.On Canada’s ongoing probe into similar cases and alleged Indian involvement, which it has linked to higher-ups including the Indian home minister, Garcetti said he didn’t have any knowledge about it at all. “I believe both of our countries have independent criminal justice systems, which are outside our intelligence systems and have to pursue facts that can hold up in a court of law. I don’t want to speak for Canada. I know it to be the case in America. My friends in Canada would say they have a similar system. I think often we see connections that don’t exist,’’ said the ambassador.Garcetti said the fact that Trump has close ties with PM Narendra Modi and the fact that he has appointed people considered pro-India as NSA and secretary of state augurs well for ties. He described Biden as the most pro-India president in US history and Modi as the most pro-US PM. “And when President Biden said this is the most important country to me when he asked me to take this position…I think he proved it. Things like ICET, envisioning IMEEC…or the work we are doing in Fiji, or southeast Asia or Africa is not just additive but also multiplicative. That legacy will be an amazing foundation for the Trump administration to further build on but will also stand on it as the brightest chapter,’’ he said.Trade war doesn’t help anybody, said Garcetti when asked about Trump’s threat to impose higher tariffs on India and others. “If we want to outcompete our main competitors…want to have a China plus one strategy, It’s not enough to have good intentions. We have to reduce tariffs further. We have to create a corridor that is trusted between our technologies. The way I hear it from the president-elect, it’s an invitation to sit down at the table, not a threat to start a trade war,’’ he said.On the US focus on human rights, minorities and freedom of speech, Garcetti said both India and the US needed to guard against misinformation and to ensure a sense of belonging for all, but added US wasn’t looking to teach or preach. “That’s for the Indians to determine. India says we will not comment on you and please don’t comment on us. America says we are going to comment on you, please do comment on us. We have a slight difference there. There have been moments when I have been blown away by the vibrancy of the Indian democracy. There are fair, free elections that are an example for others,’’ he said.Asked about some of the most challenging issues he faced during his tenure, including India’s ties with Russia and the murder-for-hire case, Garcetti said there was nothing the 2 sides could not overcome even though there were conversations that weren’t easy. “Sometimes we have to disagree on things. But we resolved our trade disputes. We are navigating through criminal cases – both what happened to Indian diplomats in San Francisco and in terms of what happened to American citizens like in the Pannun case. Democracies are complex, diverse populations are difficult to manage but it reminds me of America a few decades ago. If we put our minds together, there’s nothing we can’t do,’’ he said.","Outgoing ambassador Eric Garcetti welcomed the conclusion of the Indian probe into the murder-for-hire case. Garcetti said the investigation delivered 2 of the things that the US sought – accountability and systemic reforms. The ambassador admitted that Trump’s tariff threat could undermine the positive agenda of the relationship, but expressed confidence the relationship would continue to grow.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117307885,imgsize-890992,width-400,resizemode-4/117307885.jpg"

Are Michelle and Barack Obama getting divorced?

Social media buzz: divorce or political statement?

Public reflections on marriage struggles

The Obama love story

Whispers of a potential rift between Barack and Michelle Obama have gripped social media following Michelle's unexpected absence from two major events.Last week, the Office of Barack and Michelle Obama confirmed that the former president would attend Donald Trump’s 60th Inaugural Ceremonies alone, as Michelle had opted out. The statement, which cited no specific reason for her absence, fueled an online frenzy, especially when paired with her notable no-show at former President Jimmy Carter's funeral earlier this month due to a ""scheduling conflict.""Fans of the iconic couple, known for their seemingly unshakable bond, quickly turned to social media to voice concerns.""I'm calling it, the Obamas are getting a divorce,"" one user proclaimed on X, while another speculated, ""Her absence is no coincidence. They’re on the outs!""Others suggested that Michelle's decision not to attend was a deliberate political move rather than a sign of marital strife. ""Michelle Obama is making a political statement, not a personal one,"" a user countered, emphasizing that her choice to skip Trump's inauguration aligns with her known political stance.Despite the rumors, Barack and Michelle have openly addressed their marital struggles over the years, often framing them as a testament to their enduring commitment. From quarrels during Barack's long commutes as a young senator to the pressures of life in the White House, the couple has faced their share of challenges.In his memoir, A Promised Land, Barack revealed moments of tension during his presidency, describing an “undercurrent of tension” with Michelle that often went unspoken. Michelle, in turn, has shared candidly on her podcast about the difficulties of marriage, famously saying, ""There were times I wanted to push Barack out of the window.""However, both have emphasized the rewards of perseverance. Michelle recently reflected, “If I had given up during the tough times, I would’ve missed the beauty that came after.”While rumors swirl, the Obamas have yet to publicly address the speculation. Whether this is a moment of political strategy or personal conflict, one thing is clear: the world is watching.Barack and Michelle Obama's journey together began in 1989 at the Sidley Austin law firm in Chicago, where Michelle was tasked with mentoring a promising young Barack. What started as a professional relationship quickly grew into something deeper.After dating for a couple of years, Barack proposed to Michelle in 1991, and the couple tied the knot on October 3, 1992, at the Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago. Together, they have two daughters: Malia, born in 1998, and Sasha, born in 2001.Over the years, the Obamas have spoken candidly about the challenges they’ve faced, from balancing high-pressure careers to maintaining a strong family bond. Despite these hurdles, their love and commitment to each other have remained unshakable, inspiring millions around the world.","Barack and Michelle Obama have yet to publicly address rumors of marital strife.

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

Talk of ""Senator Ramaswamy"" is coursing through the US political arena after incoming President Donald Trump is reported to be backing his Indian-American acolyte to succeed JD Vance, who will resign his Ohio senate seat on Friday to become vice-president.Vance has served just two years of his six year term, and Ohio's governor Mike DeWine will name a successor for two years before a special election on November 3, 2026, to determine who serves until the term expires in 2029.Ramaswamy was born in Cincinnati, Ohio.Ramaswamy has previously demurred from going to the Senate, preferring to run for Governor of Ohio, but Trump, according to several media reports, is nudging him to take up the senate seat.If Ramaswamy submits to Trump's wish, he will be the first Indian-American male Senator; there are currently six Indian-American Congressmen in the House of Representatives. Kamala Harris was elected to the US Senate from California in 2016.One of several ""tech-bros"" who gravitated towards Trump in recent months, Ramaswamy is currently working with Elon Musk in the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an unofficial government body that aims to cut wasteful government expenditure and streamline the upcoming Trump administration. Although yet to be formally constituted, Musk and Ramaswamy have already begun working on the Trump agenda to right-size the government.Ramaswamy has been low-key in recent days after his remarks critiquing American education was misconstrued by MAGA radicals as calling Americans ""lazy and stupid."" More extreme MAGA radicals have called him a foreign agent, a traitor to the MAGA cause, and even asked him to ""go back to India"" where his immigrant parents hail from.","JD Vance will resign his Ohio senate seat on Friday to become vice-president.

US, Egypt, Qatar to oversee ceasefire

Credit war between Trump and Biden

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s office announced on Thursday that his Cabinet would not meet to approve the ceasefire agreement for the Gaza Strip until Hamas resolves what Israel referred to as a “last-minute crisis.”Netanyahu’s office accused Hamas of breaking parts of the agreement in an effort “to extort last-minute concessions.” Specific details about the disputed parts of the deal, however, were not provided.The Israeli Cabinet had been scheduled to ratify the agreement on Thursday.The Israel Hamas-war has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to health authorities there. The Health Ministry does not distinguish between fighters and civilians, but says women and children make up more than half the fatalities.Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza began on October 7, 2023, when militants stormed into southern Israel and killed about 1,200 people and abducted around 250. A third of the 100 hostages still held in Gaza are believed to be dead.The ceasefire agreement, reached on Wednesday, aims to pause over 15 months of conflict in the Gaza Strip. The deal also includes the phased release of hostages held by Hamas and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israel. It would allow displaced residents in Gaza to return to their homes and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to the region.Qatar, a key mediator in the deal, announced late on Wednesday that, as part of the initial stage of a ceasefire agreement to end the conflict in Gaza, 33 hostages held by Hamas would be released.Qatar’s Prime Minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani confirmed the agreement, saying that it would secure the release of hostages and prisoners and bring a return to “sustainable calm.” He added that the ceasefire is set to begin on Sunday, though some logistical issues remain to be resolved.The first phase of the ceasefire will last six weeks, during which Israeli forces will move east of Gaza, away from populated areas. Hostages will begin to be released during this phase, according to The New York Times.US President Joe Biden said that during this phase, Palestinians in Gaza would be able to return to their neighborhoods and access increased humanitarian aid.If implemented, the ceasefire will involve the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners in Israel. Around 100 hostages are believed to still be in Gaza, though Israeli authorities estimate that 35 of them may no longer be alive.Hamas leaders are seeking the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israel. According to Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, 33 Israeli hostages will be freed during the 42-day agreement, but the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released has not been specified.The agreement must be formally approved by the Israeli government. The Israeli Cabinet was set to ratify the deal Thursday. However, Netanyahu’s office said on Thursday that his Cabinet won’t meet to approve the agreement for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the release of dozens of hostages until Hamas backs down from what it called a “last minute crisis.”The ceasefire agreement will be monitored by Qatar, the United States, and Egypt, through a monitoring body based in Cairo, with Qatar's Prime Minister urging calm in Gaza ahead of the deal's implementation.Sheikh Mohammed said there was ""a clear mechanism to negotiate phase two and three"" of the agreement. He expressed hope that this would mark the end of the war and that all parties would adhere to the terms.The details of phases two and three will be determined during the execution of phase one.US President Joe Biden said that phase two aims to bring a ""permanent end to the war,"" including an exchange for the release of all surviving hostages, including male soldiers, followed by the withdrawal of all remaining Israeli forces from Gaza.Both - US President Joe Biden and US President-elect Donald Trump have claimed credit for the ceasefire agreement reached on Wednesday between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The White House confirmed that Trump’s Middle East envoy was included in the negotiations, which have been ongoing for months.Trump asserted that his role was decisive in achieving the agreement. Trump declared, ""This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies."" He also expressed satisfaction over the return of American and Israeli hostages.Trump further said that his incoming Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, had participated in the talks held in Doha, Qatar. He pledged that Witkoff would continue working with Israel and other allies to ensure Gaza would not become ""a terrorist safe haven.""Meanwhile, President Biden highlighted the role of his administration’s diplomatic efforts. Speaking from the White House, he stated, ""My diplomacy never ceased in their efforts to get this done."" He pointed to the pressures on Hamas and shifting regional dynamics, including the Lebanon ceasefire and Iran’s weakened position, as contributing factors to the agreement. Biden called the outcome the result of ""dogged and painstaking American diplomacy.""","Qatar, a key mediator in the deal, announced late on Wednesday that, as part of the initial stage of a ceasefire agreement to end the conflict in Gaza, 33 hostages held by Hamas would be released.

Implications of the deal

Qatar, Egypt and the United States announced on Wednesday that Israel and Hamas have reached a ceasefire and hostage release agreement, marking a potential turning point in one of the most devastating conflicts between the two sides.Set to take effect on January 19, the deal outlines a three-stage process aimed at achieving a ""sustainable calm."" The framework includes the release of hostages and prisoners, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas, and the resumption of humanitarian aid operations.If implemented, this agreement could end the bloodiest chapter in Israel-Hamas relations, although it leaves the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict unresolved.The following are the detailed components of the ceasefire arrangement:The first stage involves a temporary cessation of military operations between Israel and Hamas. Hamas will release 33 women and children hostages, along with hostages over 50 years old. Israel will free 30 Palestinian women and children for each Israeli hostage returned, CBS news reported.Additionally, Palestinian prisoners aged 50 or older will be released. Israeli forces will withdraw from populated areas in Gaza, and military air operations will pause for 10 hours daily, extending to 12 hours during prisoner exchanges. Large-scale aid, including food, fuel, and medical supplies, will be allowed into Gaza.In the second stage, both sides will declare a halt to all military operations. According to Arab Center Washington DC, all remaining male Israeli hostages, including civilians and soldiers, will be released in exchange for Palestinian detainees. Israeli forces will fully withdraw from Gaza.The third stage will see the exchange of the bodies of deceased hostages and combatants returned to their respective sides. A three-to-five-year plan will commence, focusing on rebuilding homes, infrastructure, and civilian facilities. The process will be overseen by Egypt, Qatar, and the United Nations. The complete blockade of Gaza will be lifted, enabling economic recovery and humanitarian relief.The agreement mirrors a proposal previously outlined by US President Joe Biden. Notably, the deal prioritizes the release of American hostages early in the process.The conflict, which began with Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, has exacted a heavy toll. Approximately 1,200 Israelis were killed during the initial Hamas assault. Over 46,000 Palestinians, including thousands of women and children, have died in Gaza, according to local health authorities.The Israeli military claims to have eliminated 17,000 Hamas fighters. Nearly 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced. The enclave’s infrastructure lies in ruins, with hundreds of thousands living in dire conditions in coastal tent camps.","Israel and Hamas have reached a ceasefire and hostage release agreement.

Fire to cover up crimes of Sean Diddy Combs?

Fact or Fiction: Hollywood sign catches fire amid LA blazes?

Cause of fire- Arson or directed energy weapons

'Government plot'



Woke politics hampered rescue and relief, claim MAGAs

As the California wildfires continue to devastate the region, a wave of conspiracy theories has emerged, sparking widespread debates and confusion.From claims linking the fires to cover-ups involving Sean ""Diddy"" Combs to accusations of government plots and mismanagement, these unverified rumors are gaining traction online. While experts emphasize environmental factors like climate change and infrastructure issues as the primary causes, the wild theories are adding to the chaos surrounding the disaster.One wild theory linked the fires to Sean ""Diddy"" Combs.Rumors suggested that the fires were deliberately set to destroy evidence connected to allegations of abuse and misconduct tied to Diddy’s infamous parties.Diddy has faced over 100 allegations of sexual misconduct, including accusations of rape and child abuse, allegedly occurring at drug-fueled gatherings at his Los Angeles estate. Some claim a “Diddy list” exists, naming high-profile celebrities who attended these parties. While the list remains unverified, its rumored existence has fueled speculation.Adding to the intrigue are bizarre claims of secret tunnels connecting Diddy’s Holmby Hills mansion to other properties, including the Playboy Mansion and Michael Jackson’s former home. Online chatter suggests these tunnels could have been used for illicit activities, though no evidence supports their existence. Some dismiss the idea as an exaggerated online joke.Former US government official Catherine Austin Fitts stoked the fire, questioning how many of those spared by the wildfires were connected to Diddy.Despite the rumors, there is no official evidence connecting Diddy to the wildfires or confirming the existence of the alleged tunnels or list.Some people claimed that the iconic Hollywood sign in LA and shared footages of the flames engulfing the sign. However, wit was later confirmed that the viral videos were AI-genrated with one even having the Hollywood sigh with 3 Ls. Also ,Jeff Zarrinnam, who serves as the chairman of the Hollywood Sign Trust, has verified that the iconic landmark remains undamaged and in its proper position, according ti LA Times.A viral video during the California wildfires led to widespread misinformation about firefighters using women's handbags to combat the blazes. However, a Los Angeles Fire Department representative quoted by CBS News clarified that the footage showed personnel utilising standard-issue canvas bags, which are routinely employed to control minor fire outbreaks.A misleading social media post on X spread unfounded allegations about Governor Newsom collaborating with developers to alter zoning regulations in Pacific Palisades' burnt areas. Newsom directly refuted this claim stating, ""This is not true.""The unsubstantiated rumour suggested that the governor was coordinating efforts to modify zoning classifications in Pacific Palisades, specifically changing single-family residential zones (R1) to multi-unit residential zones (R3) to facilitate apartment construction.Theories circulated claiming that Oregon firefighters were turned away from assisting in the L.A. firefight because their equipment failed emission tests. However, these claims were quickly disproved. Oregon firefighters actively joined the firefighting efforts. LA County fire chief Anthony Marrone addressed the rumors during a Monday news conference, stating, “The LA County Fire Department has never turned down any offers for mutual aid assistance and resources,"" adding that the equipments passed all safety check.Several people including celebrities have alleged that the recent fires in Los Angeles could be the result of arson. Actor Henry Winkler expressed his anger on X, writing, ""May you be beaten you unrecognizable!!! The pain you have caused!!!"" Meanwhile, singer Chris Brown questioned the situation, saying, ""Someone starting these fires. S— don’t add up"" TV personality Peta Murgatroyd shared a warning about men in ski masks allegedly setting fires, and Elizabeth Chambers reposted claims that the fires seemed suspicious. Podcaster Andrew Huberman also shared a video, alleging that people were lighting fires in non-burning areas of the city. Despite these claims, the Los Angeles Police Department has stated that they have not received any reports of arson.Meanwhile, a Facebook post last week claimed that directed energy weapons (DEWs) caused the wildfires in Los Angeles in 2025, referencing a McDonald's restaurant burning down in a wooded area. The image shown was actually from the 2018 Camp Fire in Northern California, not the 2025 fires in Los Angeles.According to the US Government Accountability Office, concentrated electromagnetic energy forms the basis of directed energy weapons, which are designed to cause damage or destruction to adversary targets. In recent years, numerous social media posts have incorrectly associated these weapons with significant fire incidents, despite no evidence supporting such claims.Some other theorists alleged how numerous palm trees remained intact while surrounding vehicles and residences were destroyed, using this observation to bolster their unfounded claims of ""DEW attacks"". ""Cars and homes are burned but trees are still standing,"" wrote a social media commenter, insinuating that a deliberate assault had specifically aimed at destroying personal property.Accusations emerged from conspiracy theorists who alleged government involvement in starting the Los Angeles fires. These claims extended to assertions that authorities possessed weather manipulation capabilities, supposedly using them to intensify winds and expand the fire's reach.Alex Jones, the discredited conspiracy theorist, posted on X suggesting that the fires were ""part of a larger globalist plot to wage economic warfare and deindustrialize the United States before trigger total collapse."" Musk endorsed this unfounded assertion by responding with ""True"" to Jones's post.MAGA supporters, including Elon Musk, have blamed California’s diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies for the wildfires. They argue that DEI initiatives, which prioritize diversity over qualifications, have weakened essential services like the fire department and misallocated resources. Critics say that funds spent on social programs have taken away from disaster preparedness, creating a situation where identity politics takes precedence over public safety.However, many experts disagree with this argument, pointing out that DEI hiring policies don’t compromise qualifications for critical roles. They argue that the wildfires are caused by environmental factors such as climate change, droughts, and poor infrastructure, not by diversity policies. California’s history of fire management issues, outdated infrastructure, and inadequate disaster planning are also bigger contributors to the crisis.","Theories linking the fires to cover-ups involving Sean ""Diddy"" Combs are gaining traction online. Some claim a “Diddy list” exists, naming high-profile celebrities who attended his parties. A viral video led to widespread misinformation about firefighters using women's handbags to combat the blazes. Theories circulated claiming that Oregon firefighters were turned away from assisting in the firefight because their equipment failed emission tests.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117226613,imgsize-1127666,width-400,resizemode-4/117226613.jpg"

Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Friday that a deal has been reached to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, following intense negotiations.The agreement, which includes a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of Palestinian prisoners, faced unexpected delays which Netanyahu had attributed to disputes with Hamas.Netanyahu plans to convene his security cabinet on Friday to seek approval for the agreement, after his office cited issues with Hamas reneging on parts of the deal to gain additional concessions.Despite initial optimism surrounding the announcement of the deal by the US President Joe Biden and Qatar as mediators, tensions within Netanyahu's government coalition have complicated the approval process.""Hamas is backing out of the understandings and creating a last-minute crisis that prevents a settlement,"" Netanyahu's office had said on Thursday, without specifying the exact nature of the disagreements.Israeli airstrikes have continued across Gaza, resulting in at least 72 casualties according to Gaza's health ministry. The airstrikes coincided with celebrations among Palestinians over the ceasefire deal.Under the terms of the agreement set to commence on Sunday, 33 hostages are scheduled for release over the next six weeks, in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The remaining hostages, including male soldiers, will be subject to further negotiations contingent upon a lasting ceasefire and Israeli withdrawal, conditions Hamas insists upon for their release.The agreement comes after weeks of intense violence triggered by Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, which left approximately 1,200 Israelis dead. In response, Israeli retaliatory strikes have caused over 46,000 deaths in Gaza, including thousands of women and children, according to Palestinian health authorities. The Israeli military has stated that its operations have killed 17,000 Hamas fighters.The civilian impact has been devastating, with nearly 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents displaced.

Given the timing of when it goes into effect over a holiday weekend a day before inauguration, it will be up to the next administration to implement,"" a White House official, speaking anonymously, told ABC NewsThe ban, required by a law signed by Biden last year, mandates that TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance divest the company by the day before the presidential inauguration.Trump, who previously called for a ban on the app, has since pledged to keep it available in the US, although his transition team has not provided details on how they plan to achieve this.TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew is expected to attend Trump's inauguration and be seated on the dais, signaling that the incoming administration may take steps to prevent TikTok from being shut down. According to ABC News sources, Trump also held discussions with TikTok's Chief Executive Officer Shou Chew at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida last month.Meanwhile, incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz stated that the federal law allows for an extension if a viable deal is on the table. He said, ""If the Supreme Court comes out with a ruling in favor of the law, President Trump has been very clear: Number one, TikTok is a great platform that many Americans use and has been great for his campaign and getting his message out. But number two, he's going to protect their data.""The push to save TikTok has received bipartisan support, with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer advocating for an extended deadline to find an American buyer and avoid disrupting the lives of millions of Americans and influencers.

So, amid talk that Iran and Italy were negotiating a prisoner swap that involved the US, he says, he decided to try to get a message to someone who might be in a position to help.His name was Elon Musk Not only was Musk close to Prez-elect Donald Trump, but a month before the journalist was detained, the billionaire had a secret meeting with the Iranian ambassador to the UN.Last week, the journalist, Cecilia Sala , 29, was released from prison in Iran, and days later an Iranian engineer whom Italy had detained on an American extradition request was also freed. The engineer was accused of providing material for drones used in an Iranian-backed militia attack on a US military base that killed three American service members. Musk helped secure the release of Sala by reaching out to Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani, according to two Iranian officials, one a senior diplomat at the foreign ministry, who are both familiar with the terms of the prisoner exchange . Neither Musk nor representatives of the Trump transition made comment.How Musk, an increasingly active if uncredentialed player on the world stage since the Trump victory, came to take up the journalist's cause remains unclear. He is close with Italy's PM Giorgia Meloni , who travelled to Mar-a-Lago, the Trump estate in Florida where Musk has been a regular, and met with the president-elect Jan 4.Meloni said at a news conference last week that Sala's release was the result of a ""complex work of diplomatic triangulation with Iran, and obviously also with the USA."" Her office and the Italian foreign ministry declined to comment for this article. A senior Biden official said the US govt had not been consulted, had not been given advance word about the releases and disapproved of the deal.At the presser, Meloni said she did not know what part if any Musk had played in Sala's release. ""If he had a role, I am not aware of it,"" she said. The ambiguity highlights the unusual role Musk has been playing as he sits at Trump's side, backing far-right parties in Europe even as he continues to promote his business interests abroad.Sala said in an interview that she had been held in a cell with no mattress. For weeks, she was denied her glasses, and throughout her detention she did not see a human face. She could hear sounds of other inmates crying and vomiting. What she feared the most, she said, was ""that I would go insane.""","Cecilia Sala, 29, was released from prison in Iran, and days later an Iranian engineer whom Italy had detained on an American extradition request was also freed.

A fight for credit kicks off in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-or-trump-a-fight-for-credit-kicks-off-in-us/articleshow/117315296.cms,"Washington: The long-sought, tortuously negotiated Gaza ceasefire deal announced on Wednesday came about in part through a remarkable collaboration between President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump, who temporarily put aside mutual animosity to achieve a mutual goal. The two presidents directed their advisers to work together to push Israel and Hamas over the finish line for a truce agreement.The deal is set to start Sunday, the day before Biden turns over the White House to Trump.Each president had his own interest in settling the matter before Inauguration Day. For Biden, the deal, if it holds, represents a final vindication on his watch. For Trump, the deal, for now, takes a major issue off the table, freeing him to pursue other priorities. The dramatic development cut against the natural grain in Washington, where presidents of opposing parties rarely work in tandem during a transition. But the political planets quickly returned to their normal orbits as both sides argued over who deserved credit for resolving the standoff.While Biden waited for official word to come from the region, Trump got the jump on him by disclosing the deal himself in an all-caps social media post. ""This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November,"" he added soon afterward. By the time Biden appeared before cameras at the White House later in the afternoon, he was more gracious, noting that the two teams spoke with one voice. But he bristled when asked who merited credit, him or Trump. ""Is that a joke?"" he asked. He noted that the ceasefire was ""the exact framework of the deal I proposed back in May"".Still, the partnership, awkward and prickly as it was, stood out in an era of deep polarisation. ""It really is extraordinary,"" said Mara Rudman, who was deputy special envoy for Middle East peace under President Barack Obama. ""Everybody's talking about who gets credit, but the fact is that it's shared, and part of the reason it worked is that it's shared.""However credit is ultimately apportioned, diplomats, officials and analysts said it seemed clear that both presidents had played important roles. The deal that was finally agreed to was essentially the same one that Biden had put on the table last May and that his envoys, led by Brett McGurk, his West Asia coordinator, had worked painstakingly to make acceptable to both sides. At the same time, Trump's impending return to office and his threat that ""all hell will break out"" if the hostages were not released by the time he was sworn in clearly changed the calculations of the warring parties.The coming change in political leadership in the US was not the only factor. The situation on the ground has changed dramatically: Israel has decapitated the leadership of Hamas, all but demolished its allied militia Hezbollah in Lebanon and taken out key military facilities in Iran.","The two presidents directed their advisers to work together to push Israel and Hamas over the finish line for a truce agreement.

Her team said she was vacationing in Hawaii and there was a scheduling clash. Now her office confirmed that she won't be attending Donald Trump's inauguration either -- and offered no reason.
