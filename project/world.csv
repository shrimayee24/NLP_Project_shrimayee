NEW DELHI: Eyewitnesses at the New Delhi Railway Station recounted the horrific situations that led to the deadly stampede killing at least 18 and injuring several on Saturday night. The incident occurred when a large crowd gathered at platforms 14 and 15, awaiting trains bound for Prayagraj, where the Maha Kumbh is ongoing.Talking about the stampede, an eyewitness Ravi said when people at platform 13 saw trains on platforms 14 and 15, they rushed towards these platforms. ""The platforms of the trains were not changed, but the crowd was so huge that it could not be controlled,"" he said.Another recounted the horrific scene saying that the crowd was beyond the limit. ""Such a huge crowd wasn't expected. I have never seen such a massive crowd at the railway station, even during the festivals. People from the administration and even NDRF personnel were there, but when the crowd exceeded the limit, it wasn't possible to control them,"" he said.A passenger who lost his mother in the stampede case alleged that no police were there at the moment.

Deepa Sarai has history of radical connections

BAREILLY: There was nothing for over a decade. Mohammad Usman 's whereabouts had remained a mystery. A resident of Deepa Sarai in Sambhal, he vanished in 2012 without a trace - no calls, no letters, no clue about his fate. Then, on Saturday, the silence was shattered. Police suddenly received a letter from the home department confirming that Usman, now 46, was lodged in a jail in Lahore, Pakistan.The revelation left his family in shock and prompted intel agencies to investigate whether his disappearance was part of a larger, more sinister network - terrorism.With the Pakistani foreign ministry recently informing Indian authorities that he was arrested ""last year"", the mystery surrounding Usman has only deepened.Usman had told his family he was going to Delhi before he went missing. His brother, Mohs Farman, recalled a different timeline: ""In 1995, Usman had gone to Delhi, where he learnt AC repairing. He remained in touch with the family until 2012 but vanished after security agencies began searching for him as a suspected al-Qaida terrorist.""Where was he all this while then? Caught off guard by the revelation, Indian home ministry has now tasked Sambhal police with retracing his movements and determining how he ended up in Pakistan. There is also the need to fill up gaps in the chronology.Authorities suspect Usman may have been linked to a terrorist organisation, though no concrete evidence has emerged. His wife, Razia, and other family members have been questioned, but none could explain how he reached Pakistan, by which route and showing what papers. Meanwhile, police have stepped up surveillance in the entire district, scrutinising travel records and monitoring those who have visited Pakistan in recent years.Usman's case is not an isolated one. Deepa Sarai has a history of radical connections. The neighbourhood was home to Maulana Asim Umar, also known as Shannu or Sana-ul-Haq, who became the head of al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent before being killed in a US-Afghanistan operation in 2019. Umar disappeared in the 1990s, and intelligence reports indicate that 10 to 12 young men from Deepa Sarai have gone missing since - many later surfacing in Pakistan.Sambhal SP Krishan Kumar Bishnoi confirmed Usman's arrest to TOI, adding an unexpected detail.""During questioning in Pakistan, Usman mentioned that former Sambhal MP Shafiq-ur-Rahman Barq (grandfather of current Samajwadi Party MP Zia-Ur-Rahman Barq) lived in his neighbourhood and that he also knew a certain Haji Nazeeb well. However, he was unaware that Barq had passed away. We are still trying to find out who Nazeeb is""Police have intensified their investigation, gathering data on Usman's finances, communication records, and past movements. ""His family members have been questioned, and security agencies are probing all angles,"" Bishnoi said. ""We are collecting data on mobile numbers, bank accounts, and properties. Possible hawala transactions or high-value bank transfers are also being examined,"" he added.","Mohammad Usman's whereabouts had remained a mystery.

NEW DELHI: A planeload of 119 illegal Indian immigrants from the US landed in Amritsar on Saturday making it the second deportation flight this year. This is one of the two flights of deportees expected to land in the country this weekend, news agency PTI reported, quoting official sources.It comes a day after PM Modi and US President Donald Trump vowed to address the issue during their bilateral talks. PM Modi had categorically mentioned the need to end the ecosystem that exploited people and ""fooled (them) with big dreams"" to travel to the US illegally.However, there was no discussion on the treatment meted out to the deportees, who were shackled and handcuffed on the US military aircraft, drawing criticism from the opposition leaders.Last week, a US military plane with 104 deportees landed in Amritsar drawing flak from the Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann. The CM slammed the central government and called it an effort to ""defame Punjab and Punjabis"" by turning the city into ""a deportation centre"".""This is a deliberate attempt to send out the message that only Punjabis travel illegally,"" Mann said, adding that the Centre should ""divert the aircraft to Delhi or Ahmedabad. Punjab govt will bring back Punjabis with honour. But we maintain that illegal immigration is not just Punjab's problem, but a national one.""India is the largest source of illegal immigration to the US outside Latin America, with over 7,25,000 undocumented individuals, according to US officials.Amid rising MAGA-driven opposition to immigration, which affects over a million Indian professionals and students on legitimate H-1B, L, and F1 visas, Indian officials have pushed back, emphasizing their economic contributions and the role of people-to-people ties in strengthening US-India relations .",A planeload of 119 illegal Indian immigrants from the US landed in Amritsar on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor offered a rare moment of praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi following his recent visit to the United States. Tharoor acknowledged key achievements from PM Modi ’s visit, particularly on trade negotiations and defence cooperation. He welcomed the trade deal discussions and expressed optimism over India’s diplomatic engagements.However, his remarks prompted a clarification from the Congress party , which said that individual opinions do not reflect the party’s official stance.He stressed that when someone in the government does the right thing, it should be recognised, irrespective of who's in power.“For 16 years, I have been in politics. My attitude has been that when somebody in the government, whether it’s our government or some other party’s government, does the right thing or does something well, one should acknowledge and praise it, and when they do something badly, one should criticise it.”“If I were to praise all the time, no one would take me seriously. If I were to criticise all the time, no one would take me seriously either… There’s got to be some give and take in democracy,” the Congress MP said.Tharoor also welcomed the progress on trade talks between India and the US, saying that an agreement had been reached to conduct negotiations over the next nine months. “It’s far better than Washington hastily and unilaterally imposing some tariffs on us, which could have damaged and hurt our exports. It seems to me that something good has been achieved, and I applaud that as an Indian,” he said.On illegal immigration, he questioned whether Modi had raised concerns over the treatment of Indian nationals deported from the US. “There are some questions that still remain… Why did the question of the way in which those illegal immigrants were returned to India not get addressed? Did PM Modi raise it behind closed doors?”He further elaborated, “The only thing missing from what Prime Minister Modi said was the question of the manner in which those people were treated and sent back. I think otherwise his stand was absolutely correct. These are misled youth who have been encouraged or induced to migrate illegally, and they should be taken back. If they are Indian citizens, they belong in our country, we take them back. But I hope that something was said behind closed doors, not perhaps in the press conference, but inside privately, that this manner of doing it—the handcuffs, the insults, the mistreatment, the military aircraft—all that should be avoided in future.”On Trump calling PM Modi a better negotiator than himself, the Congress MP called it an ""astonishing"" acknowledgment. He noted that Trump, known for branding himself as a master dealmaker, rarely compliments others, especially in areas he considers his expertise.""I think calling Mr. Modi a better negotiator than himself is astonishing because Mr. Trump takes pride in being this sort of art of the deal that is his strength. And his admirers, including yesterday the defense secretary of the US, had said that Mr. Trump is the greatest negotiator in the world.""""And here Mr. Trump says Mr. Modi is better than him. So I think we are looking at a very high degree of praise from a man who is not known for saying praiseworthy things. So this is good news,"" Tharoor said.Following Tharoor’s comments, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh took to social media to clarify the party’s position without directly naming Tharoor. In a post on X, he wrote, “The Indian National Congress is our country’s ONLY political party where there is absolute freedom of speech as well as freedom after speech. Members give their views on issues which are, on occasion, their own and do not reflect the opinion of the party as a collective entity. It is the party’s stance that is paramount.”","Congress MP Shashi Tharoor offered a rare moment of praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi following his recent visit to the United States.

The Telangana chief minister had claimed that PM Modi did not belong to the backward classes at the time he was born, which the BJP criticised calling it an ""irresponsible"" comment.Union minister G Kishan Reddy hit out at Reddy for the comments, saying the CM ""should make statements based on facts"".""How can he (Revanth Reddy) speak so irresponsibly? If you make a statement, it should be based on facts,"" said Kishan Reddy, who is also the president of Telangana BJP told news agency PTI.Revanth Reddy, speaking at a Congress event on Friday, also accused PM Modi of being ""anti-backward class in mentality."" The CM claimed Modi's caste was classified as a ""forward caste"" before he became Gujarat Chief Minister.Retorting to the CM's claim, G Kishan Reddy asserted that the BJP has taken several measures for the welfare of backward classes. He said the BC Commission was granted constitutional status after Modi became Prime Minister, not during previous Congress regimes.The CM was speaking after a presentation on the government's caste survey and SC categorisation exercise in the state.Revanth said the BJP was trying to portray the Congress government's caste survey in Telangana as faulty as otherwise the Modi govt would be under pressure to conduct it in the entire country and also amend the Constitution to enhance BC reservations.He also asked how the BRS and BJP could say the survey statistics were wrong when there was no official statistic available before the Congress' survey.""We did the survey scientifically and 96.9 per cent of population in Telangana gave details voluntarily. The survey forms were filled up or signed by the family member who gave details. Now, we have started a second round of survey to give an opportunity to the remaining 3.1 per cent,"" Revanth said.""It doesn't matter even if I end up as the last chief minister from the Reddy community. As a disciplined party worker and CM, I took up the caste survey to keep the promise given by our leader Rahul Gandhi. This is my commitment. The caste census was not done for my benefit or my position. The caste survey is accurate and there are no faults in its statistics.

Smugglers use TikTok to target Indians for illegal US migration: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/smugglers-use-tiktok-to-target-indians-for-illegal-us-migration-report/articleshow/118280916.cms,"New York Post

As a second US plane carrying deported Indian nationals prepares to land in Amritsar, a report has revealed that smugglers are openly using social media to facilitate illegal migration to the United States. According to the, human traffickers , known as ""coyotes,"" have been advertising their services on TikTok, offering Indian nationals a route into the US via Canada for as much as $5,000. These posts, claim to provide a ""100% safe"" journey with ""payment after reach.""The social media posts promise a hassle-free crossing from cities like Montreal, Brampton, and Surrey into the US states of New York or Washington. The New York Post contacted a smuggler who confirmed a charge of $4,500 for a journey involving a two-hour car ride and a 25-minute walk through the woods, where migrants are given a map to navigate the border. Up to five individuals are reportedly taken at a time in these ""group walks.""While smugglers continue to exploit social media for illegal migration, the US has intensified its crackdown. On Saturday, a plane carrying 119 deported Indian nationals is set to arrive at Amritsar’s Sri Guru Ramdas Ji International Airport. This marks the second batch of deportees under the Trump administration’s stricter immigration policies. Official told confirmed that 67 of those being deported are from Punjab, 33 from Haryana, eight from Gujarat, three from Uttar Pradesh, two each from Goa, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan, and one each from Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. A third flight, carrying 157 deportees, is expected to arrive on February 16.Earlier this month, a US military aircraft transported 104 deportees back to India. Many of them had attempted to enter the US using “donkey routes,” a term for the illegal and often dangerous paths taken by migrants. These individuals had reportedly paid large sums to human traffickers but were caught at the border and sent back in shackles.The deportations have sparked controversy, particularly in Punjab, where chief minister Bhagwant Mann has accused the central government of deliberately choosing Amritsar as the landing site to ""defame Punjab and Punjabis."" Addressing the media on Friday, Mann questioned the selection of Amritsar over other major airports like Delhi, alleging a political agenda behind the move. He claimed that the Centre was portraying Punjab as a hub for illegal migration, despite the issue being a nationwide problem.“The BJP-led Centre always discriminates against Punjab. It does not let go of any chance to defame the state,” Mann said. He insisted that Punjab would welcome the deportees with dignity and offer them support, including a visit to the Golden Temple’s langar. Mann also demanded action against fraudulent agents responsible for misleading youth into illegal migration.In response, BJP leader Tarun Chugh accused Mann of playing politics over the issue. He argued that the real concern should be why so many young people were forced to migrate illegally in the first place. “People of Punjab want to know who misled these youths, who forced them to sell their land and homes. Rather than catching the culprits, the AAP leader is politicising the issue,” Chugh said.","Smugglers are advertising their services on TikTok, offering Indian nationals a route into the US via Canada for as much as $5,000.

Most deaths due to suffocation amidst chaos



NEW DELHI: A stampede at New Delhi railway station on Saturday night because of an unprecedented number of passengers headed for Maha Kumbh is learned to have claimed at least 15 lives, including three children. Many people were injured in the ensuing panic and mad scramble to either board the trains or rush out of the station.The chief casualty medical officer at LNJP confirmed that 15 people had lost their lives and 10 others were injured. The casualties we- re mostly due to suffocation. “Distressed by the stampede... My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones,” PM Modi posted on X.Thousands of passengers were caught in the deadly crush that unfolded in a matter of minutes, leaving a trail of death in its wake. Frantic screams and cries for help filled the air. The chaotic situa tion began to unfold at 9.45pm. A large number of people headed for Prayagraj had gathered on platform numbers 13 and 14 to board their trains, officials said. According to railway police, a massive crowd was waiting for Prayagraj Express on platform no. 14.“Swatantrata Senani Express and Bhubaneshwar Rajdhani were delayed, and passengers of these trains were also present at platform no. 12, 13 and 14, leading to a massive build-up of crowds,” a senior officer said. According to railway police, 1,500 general tickets had been sold and that was the primary reason the crowd became unmanageable.“The stampede-like situation was mainly on platform no. 14 and near the escalator near platform no. 1,” said a senior cop. The announcement of the arrival of a special train may have added to the chaos. An FIR of causing death due to negligence was being registered and a special team formed to investigate the matter.“Situation under control at New Delhi railway station. Delhi Police and RPF have reached. The injured were taken to hospital. 4 special trains were run to evacuate sudden rush,” railway minister Ashwini Vaishnav posted on X.There has been an unfortunate and tragic incident at New Delhi Railway Station,” lieutenant general V K Saxena posted on X.“Have spoken to chief secretary & police commissioner and asked them to address the situation.

Their condition was reported to be critical and they were immediately rushed to a hospital for medical treatment,” said DCP KPS Malhotra.Delhi Fire Services had received an emergency call and promptly dispatched four fir e tenders. Additionally, ambulances were rushed to the spot.A passenger going to Prayagraj said he was travelling with his family and had a reservation with the train scheduled to leave at 10.40pm. “We reached at 8.30pm but it was too crowded.

Rest of deportees are from Gujarat (8), UP (3), Goa, Maharashtra and Rajasthan (2 each), and Himachal and J&K (1 each).There was no official confirmation of the break-up and the arrival time of the third US aircraft until late Friday.When the first flight from US landed on February 5, Congress & AAP questioned why Amritsar was picked as the destination.Mann said despite his criticism of the move, he would welcome deportees, take them to Golden Temple langar and do everything possible to rehabilitate them. ""This is a deliberate attempt to send out the message that only Punjabis travel illegally,"" he alleged, saying foreign ministry should ""divert the aircraft to Delhi or Ahmedabad.

A mourning ritual turned into community feast in celebration



PRAYAGRAJ: To the list of superstitions linked with 'unlucky' 13 has been added the lucky coincidence of a presumed Maha Kumbh stampede victim from Prayagraj trudging back home this Tuesday to find the neighbourhood commemorating his 'tehrvi' - the ritual performed on 13th day after a death.Turns out 60-something Khunti Guru , nonplussed at the fuss over his rumoured death in the Jan 29 stampede, had had one chillum of ganja too many with some sadhus and lost track of time.Almost two weeks would go by before he remembered that his 10x12 room in Chahchand Gali of Prayagraj's Zero Road was waiting for him. By then, Khunti Guru's extended family comprising almost the entire locality had organised elaborate religious rituals in memory of the much-loved local jester.""I slept rather long... could be a few days,"" the 'Dead Man Walking' said, responding to the barrage of questions and curious looks that greeted his arrival. Khunti Guru's tehrvi was quickly forgotten in the euphoria of seeing him alive, but not the food. What was meant to be a mourning ritual turned into community feasting in celebration of the popular, happy-go-lucky character's 'rebirth'.Abhai Awasthi, a social worker, said Khunti Guru, stepped out on the evening of Jan 28, telling whomever he met in Chahchand Gali that he would be back after a dip at Sangam on Mauni Amavasya .""The stampede happened early the next day and we got worried about him. We looked for him everywhere we could but there was no trace of him. Finally, presuming him dead, we organised prayers for him,"" Awasthi told TOI.Just as the rituals were nearing completion, a familiar figure alighted from an e-rickshaw. ""Our beloved Khunti Guru asked us smilingly, ""What are you people up to?' It's hard describing how we felt,"" Awasthi said.Locals say his father, Kanhaiyala Mishra, was a reputable lawyer. Not much is known about what happened to the family but Khunti Guru apparently didn't complete his education and stayed back in the area.The room he now lives in is apparently what remains of the Mishra family's ancestral home. Shopkeepers in the neighbourhood give him food and clothing in return for their daily fix of gossip, peppered with anecdotes delivered in Khunti Guru's inimitable style. ""Although he has a bed in his room, Khunti Guru prefers sleeping in the compound of a local Shiva temple,"" a resident said.",'Dead Man Walking' Khunti Guru returns home to find neighbourhood commemorating his 'tehrvi' - the ritual performed on 13th day after a death.

Elon Musk's father Errol on his parenting: “If Elon hears this he’s gonna shoot me...

Elon Musk’s father, Errol Musk, has openly criticized his son’s parenting, calling him a neglectful father who hasn’t been present for his many children. In a viral interview on the Wide Awake podcast with Joshua Rubin, Errol bluntly stated, “No, he hasn’t been a good father.” He then goes on to talk about Musk’s first child Nevada Alexander, and his death. “The first child was too much with nannies and died in the care of a nanny. What I’m saying, if Elon hears this he’s gonna shoot me or something. But anyway, that’s what I think, that’s no good,” he said.Elon Musk has fathered 12 children with different partners, including Justine Musk, Grimes, and Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis. His first child, Nevada Alexander, tragically passed away at just 10 weeks old due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).Errol Musk elaborated on his concerns, claiming that Elon’s other children were also raised with minimal parental involvement. “They were too rich, too many nannies. Then he had five children with the same woman. Five sons all bought up, each one had its own nanny. You following me”.The elder Musk went on to assert that this upbringing had lasting effects. “The result is the boys and Kimbal’s two boys grew up not able to cross a street. Even the street outside, my daughters would say, ‘Dad, you won’t believe it. Elon’s kids and Kimbal’s boys, they can’t cross the road. We have to hold their hands across the road when they’re like 14 years old, can’t cross the road.’”Errol further speculated that this detached upbringing might be linked to certain personal challenges faced by his grandchildren. “Elon’s got to deal with it. It’s, it’s a bit worrying,” he remarked, referencing one of Elon’s children and one of Kimbal’s children being transgender.Elon Musk was recently seen taking his young son X to a press conference in the Oval Office alongside former U.S. President Donald Trump. He brought X along with Azure, and Strider—to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House.However, his ex-partner, musician Grimes, has expressed disapproval of X’s increasing public exposure. “He should not be in public like this,” she wrote on Musk’s social media platform, X.","Elon Musk's father, Errol, has openly criticized his son's parenting.

NEW DELHI: A stampede at New Delhi Railway Station on Saturday night claimed 18 lives as thousands of devotees thronged the station to travel to Prayagraj for the Maha Kumbh 2025 festival. The incident occurred around 10 pm, with severe overcrowding leading to chaos.An eyewitness, an Indian Air Force sergeant, recounted that despite repeated announcements urging people to avoid gathering in large numbers, the crowd remained uncontrollable.""The administration was trying to manage the situation, but people were not listening. I also helped the injured with a friend,"" he told ANI.Another witness described the sheer scale of the crowd, stating that even personnel from the administration and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) struggled to control the surge. ""I have never seen such a massive crowd at the station, even during festivals,"" he said.A key trigger for the stampede was an announcement regarding a last-minute platform change, which led to passengers rushing from both sides. ""It was announced that the train arriving at platform 12 would now come on platform 16, causing panic and overcrowding,"" an eyewitness recalled.Among the victims was a woman who lost her life as her family of 12 attempted to navigate the packed station. Her brother, speaking from LNJP Hospital, said, ""We hadn’t even reached the platform. My sister was stuck in the crowd, and we found her after half an hour—by then, she was dead.""Railway officials reported that delays in train departures, coupled with the sale of around 1,500 general tickets, exacerbated the congestion. Four special trains were introduced to manage the rush, but the situation spiralled out of control. Some passengers fainted and required hospitalisation, while authorities temporarily blocked entry to the station to regain order.NDRF Commandant Daulat Ram Chaudhary confirmed that the situation was now under control. ""The injured have been evacuated, and train movement has returned to normal,"" he stated.Meanwhile, a two-member high-level committee has been established to investigate the incident. Railway Board official Dilip Kumar said, ""The fact-finding process is underway. We will determine the cause of the tragedy following an inquiry.""Deputy commissioner of Police (DCP) Railways KPS Malhotra acknowledged that authorities had anticipated a large crowd but said the incident unfolded within moments.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan denounced on Friday the reference against it in a joint India-US declaration, calling it “one-sided, misleading, and contrary to diplomatic norms”.The joint India-US statement called on Islamabad to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attack and the Pathankot attack and ensure that its territory is not used to carry out cross-border terrorist attacks.“We consider the Pakistan-specific reference in the Indo-US joint statement on February 13, 2025 as one-sided, misleading and contrary to diplomatic norms ,” foreign office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said at a weekly press briefing.“We are surprised that the reference has been added to the joint statement notwithstanding Pakistan’s counterterrorism cooperation with the US,” Khan said. “Such references cannot cover up India’s sponsorship of terrorism, subversion and extrajudicial assassinations in the region and beyond, nor can they shift international attention from the stark reality of India being a safe haven for the perpetrators of hate crimes against Muslims and other minorities,” the FO spokesperson said.“Pakistan is also deeply concerned over the planned transfer of military technology to India. Such steps accentuate military imbalances in the region and undermine strategic stability. They remain unhelpful in achieving durable peace in South Asia,” Khan said.“We urge our international partners to take a holistic and objective view of issues of peace and security in South Asia and refrain from endorsing positions that are one-sided and divorced from ground realities,” he said.","The joint India-US statement called on Islamabad to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attack and the Pathankot attack. “We consider the Pakistan-specific reference in the Indo-US joint statement on February 13, 2025 as one-sided, misleading and contrary to diplomatic norms,” foreign office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118257401,imgsize-34754,width-400,resizemode-4/118257401.jpg"

President Trump floated the idea of a three-way meeting with the leaders of Russia and China in which the countries would agree to cut defence spending in half.Trump, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office Thursday, suggested that he'd seek such a deal with Presidents Xi and Putin, saying the money could be spent better elsewhere. ""One of the first meetings I want to have is with President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia,"" Trump said. ""And I want to say, 'let's cut our military budget in half.' And we can do that. And I think we'll be able to do it.""The comments topped off another one of the free-wheeling press interactions that have become common in Trump's second term. Such deep cuts in defence spending would fundamentally reshape US military posture around the world and face sharp pushback from US contractors and lawmakers whose states benefit from billions of dollars in defence spending every year.Trump's views also underscored how willing he is to upend standard foreign-policy craft in Washington. He has made no secret of his desire for closer ties with Russia and China, two US adversaries. He sparked an uproar this week by having a phone call with Putin to start talks on ending the Ukraine war. US allies in Europe said any such talks must take place with Ukraine's participation.It's also far from certain that China or Russia would agree to such cuts given how US defence spending of about $850 billion dwarfs their annual outlays. China was forecast to spend about $230 billion in 2024 and is in the middle of a major military expansion. Russia's 2024 budget has grown significantly since the start of war in Ukraine but was still about half that.When asked about Trump's remarks at a regular press briefing in Beijing on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said ""the limited national defence spending of China is what is needed to defend its national sovereignty, security and development interests, and what is needed to safeguard world peace.""",President Trump said he wants to meet with the leaders of Russia and China.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called Saturday for the creation of a European army , as he insisted Kyiv and its backers on the continent must be listened to in peace talks with Russia .Speaking at a gathering of top policymakers in Munich, the Ukrainian leader said that with the return of President Donald Trump to the White House Europe could no longer count on Washington to always have its back.Trump stunned allies and upended the status quo of US support for Ukraine this week when he announced he would likely soon meet Russian leader Vladimir Putin to start truce talks.Zelenskyy's rallying cry came a day after he met US Vice President JD Vance as Kyiv scrambles to ensure it is not sidelined in Washington's push to wrap up the three-year war. ""Let's be honest - now we can't rule out the possibility that America might say no to Europe on issues that threaten it,"" Zelenskyy said. ""I really believe that time has come. The Armed Forces of Europe must be created.""The push for a joint continental force has been mooted for years without gaining traction and Zelenskyy's intervention seems unlikely to shift the balance.In the short-term, the priority for Kyiv remains ensuring its voice is heard at any peace talks involving Russia and that it doesn't get a bad deal.

He's going to say, 'Everything is on the table, let's make a deal'.""Whilst affirming Ukraine's independence as a non-negotiable element in any agreement with Putin, Vance was non-committal about the extent of Russian-occupied territory that might remain under Kremlin control.""There are any number of formulations, of configurations, but we do care about Ukraine having sovereign independence,"" the vice president explained. The specifics of security guarantees from the US or European nations would be determined during negotiations, according to Vance.He indicated that Trump might adjust negotiating terms based on how discussions progress.Vance elaborated on Trump's flexibility, suggesting items could be added or removed from negotiations depending on the parties' behaviour and Ukrainian priorities.Trump posted on Truth Social: ""[W]e want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine.""Later Thursday, Trump confirmed Ukraine's participation in Russian negotiations whilst expressing support for Russia's return to the G-7.","US Vice President JD Vance said the US might impose sanctions and consider military intervention if Russia's Vladimir Putin fails to conclude the ongoing Ukraine conflict.

Black Hawk helicopter crew may read wrong altitude before crash and missed radio communications: Investigators,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/black-hawk-helicopter-crew-may-read-wrong-altitude-before-crash-and-missed-radio-communications-investigators/articleshow/118283576.cms,"The crew of an Army helicopter, which collided with an American Airlines near Washington DC, may have read the wrong altitude before the crash and missed radio communications, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.A passenger jet and a Black Hawk helicopter that collided in midair on the night of January 29 and crashed into the Potomac River near Reagan National Airport near Washington, DC, claiming the lives of 67 people.NTSB chief Jennifer Homendy told explained that crucial instructions were possibly missed due to overlapping radio transmissions. The helicopter crew, conducting a night vision goggle certification flight, might have missed important tower communications about runway changes.“That transmission was interrupted -– it was stepped on,” she said, leaving them unable to hear the words “pass behind the” because the helicopter's microphone key was pressed at the same moment.The helicopter pilots may have also missed part of another communication, when the tower said the jet was shifting to a different runway, she said.Homendy said the helicopter was on a “check"" flight that night where the pilot was undergoing an annual test and a test on using night vision goggles. Investigators believe the crew was wearing night vision goggles throughout the flight.It will take more than a year to get the final NTSB report on the collision, and Homendy warned reporters that many issues were still being probed.“We're only a couple weeks out,” from the crash, she said. “We have a lot of work to do.”The investigation revealed the Black Hawk was flying at approximately 325 feet, exceeding its 200-foot limit. Discrepancies in altitude readings were noted, with the pilot reporting 300 feet whilst the instructor indicated 400 feet. The helicopter's radio altimeter recorded 278 feet at impact.Aviation experts, including William Waldock from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and retired pilot John Cox, provided insights about radio communication issues and visual separation protocols. Cox emphasised that the helicopter crew had accepted responsibility for maintaining visual separation with the airliner.The Army crew members were identified as Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach, Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O'Hara, and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves. The American Airlines pilot was Jonathan Campos. The passengers included hunters, students, parents, and members of the Skating Club of Boston returning from a development camp.President Donald Trump made unsubstantiated claims about the crash, initially blaming the helicopter's altitude and later criticising the air traffic control system. The NTSB's final report is expected to take over a year to complete.","Helicopter crew may have missed important tower communications about runway changes.

ISLAMABAD: At least 10 people were killed and six injured a bomb planted by the road exploded as a pickup truck carrying coal mine workers went by in Harnai district of southwestern Balochistan province on Friday, officials said.Hazrat Wali Kakar, Harnai’s top civilian official, said the bomb was an improvised explosive device (IED). “Ten mining workers were killed in the attack,” Kakar said.Saleem Tareen, another local official, said most of the victims were from the country’s northwestern Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province. “The labourers were traveling to a market in Harnai,” he added. Harnai lies some 160 km east of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province.Authorities said they were investigating the attack, with officials saying evidence was being collected and that preliminary investigation showed the explosive material had been planted on the roadside.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack yet. But the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant organisation fighting for independence, is active in the restive province that borders Afghanistan and Iran. The group usually targets security forces as well as Pakistanis from other provinces. Local media reported that most of the workers killed or injured came from KP’s Puran village.The BLA has also targeted Chinese projects in the region, arguing that foreigners are exploiting resource-rich Balochistan while the impoverished residents are left behind.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif responded to the incident by reaffirming his commitment to aggressively working to eradicate terrorism in the country.",A bomb planted by the road exploded as a pickup truck carrying coal mine workers went by.
