2 attacks revive wolf terror in Uttar Pradesh's Bahraich after 6-day lull,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/woman-saves-6-year-old-son-from-wolfs-jaws-in-ups-bahraich/articleshow/112974854.cms,"Since March, eight people, seven of them children, have died in wolf attacks in the Bahraich region of Uttar Pradesh

Lone wolf may be the killer, says expert

LUCKNOW: Two stealth attacks on people asleep outdoors broke a six-day lull in wolf terror in UP's Bahraich early on Sunday, starting with a six-year-old child being dragged away by his neck before the boy's muffled scream woke up his mother and led her to make a desperate lunge that scared away the predator.Gudiya, of Hardi village, had her son Paras next to her on a cot on the veranda of their home when the wolf sneaked up on them and targeted the child.The attack was eerily similar to the one in which a seven-year-old boy, Ayansh, was killed after being snatched from his sleeping mother in the same area on July 26.Paras was lucky to escape with bite marks in the neck region, just as 55-year-old Kunnu Lal of nearby Darhiya village, who was rescued by his family after a wolf pounced on him barely two hours after the first attack. ""I woke up to find my boy in the animal's jaws. I acted instinctively and pulled my son away with as much strength as I could muster. My cries for help alerted others and the wolf disappeared in the dark,"" Gudiya said.Since March, eight people, seven of them children, have died in wolf attacks in the Bahraich region. Over 20 people have been wounded. The attack on Paras took place around 2.30am. The child is being treated at Mahsi community health centre near the village. Kunnu Lal, who was taken to the same facility, had similar injuries. Divisional forest officer Ajeet Pratap Singh confirmed that both were wolf attacks.Over 150 provincial arm- ed constabulary personnel and 25 forest department teams have been deployed to tackle the wolf terror am- id reports the attacks might be by a single rogue animal.A lone wolf rather than a pack of six may have killed eight people — seven of them children — in Bahraich since March, biologist and ex-Wildlife Institute of India dean Yadvendradev Vikramsinh Jhala said Sunday after a resurgence of nightly attacks in two adjacent villages in district, reports Pathikrit Chakraborty. Jhala, who has extensively studied wolf behaviour, said pattern of injuries indicated a single animal was involved in the fatal attacks so far. “If a pack of wolves were involved, the bodies would have been decapitated. In all the documented cases, the bodies were found intact,” he said.","Since March, eight people, seven of them children, have died in wolf attacks in the Bahraich region of Uttar Pradesh.

KOLKATA: Sanjay Roy , the prime accused in the rape-and-murder of the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital doctor, in his first interaction with his lawyer in Presidency Jail , has told her that he wants to plead ""not guilty"" in court. Speaking with lawyer Kavita Sarkar , he also said he maintained his innocence in the polygraph test .According to lawyers in touch with Roy, during the polygraph test, he was asked about 10 questions, including what his next act was after committing the murder.Roy interrupted at this point and claimed that he had not committed the murder and such a question does not arise. He said he had entered the room and found the woman lying unconscious. His lawyers claimed that he was asked different questions, including his academic background. There were a few questions related to the incident.During this test - and in his interaction with Sarkar - Roy said he was being framed since he did not even know the woman. When he entered the room, he saw her covered in blood. He claimed that he rushed out of the spot as he panicked. When the CBI officers asked him why he did not inform the police outpost at RG Kar Hospital if he was not guilty, Roy said that he panicked and feared that none would believe his statements.Roy, who has been kept in a high-security ward in Presidency jail, has kept mostly to himself, jail officials said. ""There appears to be brooding, almost with a sense of fear, in the way he talks,"" an officer said, pointing out that he spoke at length with his lawyer under tight security.CBI officers, who have so far spoken to a number of witnesses, believe that Roy had been trying to shift focus and mislead the investigators. But Roy's lawyers claimed that his statement can be corroborated with theCCTV footage to ascertain the truth. ""If he had access to the seminar hall so easily, it shows that there was a security lapse on that night and someone else could also have taken advantage of that,"" said Sarkar, the lawyer appointed by Legal Aid Defence Counsel System for Roy.Sarkar said, ""The CBI has not shared anything related to the case with us. Roy is entitled to a free copy of the FIR. The agency has not even supplied that. Instead, we have been asked to procure a certified copy from the court.""","Sanjay Roy is prime accused in the rape-and-murder of the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital doctor.

Jeff Walz? Why doesn't he like Tim?

Amid reports that Tim Walz's elder brother Jeff Walz is a MAGA supporter and 100% opposed to all ideologies of Tim, the VP candidate of the Democratic Party, Donald Trump Sunday commented that Tim Walz's brother sounded like a great guy to him. Jeff Walz declared that he is not supporting his brother and Kamala Harris. He said Tim Walz is not the type of person who should decide America's future.Jeff is open about his differences with Tim with whom he has not spoken in eight years. The revelation was made in a Facebook post which made the Republicans jump in joy -- only to be reminded by the Democrats that Trump and Kennedy Jr too do not have much of a family support.67-year-old Jeff is Tim's elder brother with zero faith in Tim. He's contemplating publicly endorsing Donald Trump but is not sure whether he should drag the entire family in it. “The stories I could tell. Not the type of character you want making decisions about your future,” he said adding that Tim did not inform the family that he was running for the vice president.Jeff has always been a Trump supporter, a registered Republican who donated $20 to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. On March 30, 2023 when Trump was indicted by a Manhattan grand jury over hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels, Jeff wrote: ""We've just become a third world banana republic.""Jeff lives on the Florida panhandle in Freeport with his wife Laurie. He and Laurie owned So Fine Music in Inverness, a musical instrument and equipment store from 2001 to 2010, according to public records. Walz was also an assistant principal at a Citrus County middle school in the early 2000s, New York Post reported. Laurie Walz on Facebook is friends with Tim Walz and other family members.Why Jeff hates Tim is not clearly known. Like Tim, Jeff also used to work at a school -- an assistant principal at a middle school in Citrus County, Florida, in the early 2000s. They both have criminal cases -- while Tim Walz pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of reckless driving over a 2005 drunk driving arrest, Jeff pleaded guilty for allegedly stealing from a Walmart store in 2001.",67-year-old Jeff Walz declared that he is not supporting his brother and Kamala Harris.

Angry Israelis push Netanyahu’s red lines on hostage deaths,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/angry-israelis-push-netanyahus-red-lines-on-hostage-deaths/articleshow/113008482.cms,"After six Israeli hostages were found shot dead in a Gaza tunnel at the weekend, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did something he hadn’t done in 11 months of war — he apologized to the bereaved families.“I want to tell you how sorry I am and ask for forgiveness for not being able to bring Sasha back alive,” he told the parents of Alexander Lobanov in the first of a series of such phone calls.The gesture was among signs the discovery may prove to be a turning point in Israel’s long-running conflict with Hamas , after several months of inconclusive cease-fire negotiations. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis protested on Sunday to demand a truce with the Iran-backed group, while the main trade union called a strike that temporarily shut down banks, shopping malls and even the main airport on Monday morning.“Netanyahu realized that a line had been crossed,” wrote commentator Yoav Limor in the Israel Hayom newspaper, a reference to the sense among many Israelis that the government didn’t do enough to save the hostages. “As of yesterday, Israel is not the same country.”What that means for Netanyahu’s stance on the war remains to be seen. On Monday night, he gave a defiant press conference, saying Israel will not give up control of the border area between Gaza and Egypt, the so-called Philadelphi corridor, as Hamas has demanded.Israel’s control of the area is key to “defeating Hamas, returning hostages and ensuring Gaza doesn’t pose a threat in the future,” he said. He added, “If we leave, we won’t go back,” citing “immense international pressure” that would be exerted on Israel.Through that corridor, he said, Hamas has imported tons of arms that it has used against Israel. That pathway must be permanently controlled by Israel, he said.Many argue US President Joe Biden ’s administration should use the moment to press both Israel and Hamas to finally reach an agreement. The Washington Post reported on Monday that the US, alongside other international brokers Qatar and Egypt, is preparing a “take-it-or-leave-it” final deal.“We’re very close” to tabling a proposal, Biden told reporters at the White House on Monday. Asked if Netanyahu is doing enough to secure the hostages, he answered simply “no.”Israel has waged its campaign in Gaza ever since thousands of Hamas operatives swarmed into the south of the country on October 7, killing 1,200 people and abducting 250. In that time the government has pursued two often contradictory goals: destroy the group’s military and political infrastructure and bring the hostages back alive.For the duration of the conflict — in which more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to health officials in Hamas-run Gaza — Israel assumed Hamas was protecting hostages to trade for concessions, such as the freeing of Palestinian prisoners. The discovery of the dead abductees casts doubt on that thesis.“What we see in Hamas now, after 11 months of war, is a collapse of the command structure,” said Uzi Rabi, a senior researcher on Palestinian issues at Tel Aviv University. “This means that Israel’s policy of increased military pressure, which you could argue was working, may no longer serve the purpose. It’s a double-edged sword, and Netanyahu may have to shift policy.”Hostages will “go back to their families in coffins” if Netanyahu keeps insisting on securing their release through military pressure, Abu Obaida, a spokesman for Hamas’s armed wing, said on his Telegram channel.Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has been arguing that the country should accept a cease-fire proposal put forward by the US. First made public by Biden at the end of May, it calls for a three-stage process starting with the freeing of hostages in exchange for a withdrawal of Israeli troops.Netanyahu’s own position has moved around. Most recently, he’s come down on the side of his right-wing coalition partners, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who say Israel mustn’t stop fighting Hamas even for a day until total victory is achieved. The release of hostages, they say, will follow.Israeli public opinion, once on their side, has shifted. A monthly poll asking whether a hostage deal should be prioritized over destroying Hamas showed 72% in favor in July, up from 67% in June and 46% in May.Israeli media reports on the cease-fire negotiations showed that some of those found dead were on the list of hostages due to be exchanged. That made their deaths more painful for families and friends, and a key element of Sunday’s protests was that Israel failed them.“Our Hands Aren’t Clean of Their Blood,” ran a front-page headline in the centrist Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper on Monday.Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition partners retain a degree of support, including among a small number of families of those still held in Gaza. They are members of a group called the Tikva Forum, which opposes compromise with Hamas and called on Israelis not to join demonstrations or strikes. Hamas is designated a terrorist organization by the US.The mother of one of those found dead on Sunday said on the radio that “he would not be willing to have one terrorist released for him.”Micah Goodman, a public intellectual of moderate political leanings, wrote in Israel Hayom that since the military has weakened Hamas, the strategic cost of a hostage deal is much lower than earlier in the conflict. It’s vital to find a way to reach an agreement, he said, to heal the nation.“The two war objectives can be translated into two moral and Jewish aspirations: to take Hamas apart and to put Israel back together,” he said.",Six Israeli hostages were found shot dead in a Gaza tunnel at the weekend. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized to the bereaved families. The gesture was among signs the discovery may prove to be a turning point in Israel’s conflict with Hamas.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113008548,imgsize-107822,width-400,resizemode-4/113008548.jpg"
Meandering? Trump says his 'weave' is oratorical genius,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/meandering-trump-says-his-weave-is-oratorical-genius/articleshow/113008434.cms,"For weeks, ex-prez Donald Trump's advisers have urged him to be more disciplined and to stop straying off-message. But on Friday, while speaking at a rally , Trump insisted that his oratory is not a campaign distraction but rather a rhetorical triumph .""You know, I do the weave,"" he said. ""You know what the weave is? I'll talk about like nine different things, and they all come back brilliantly together, and it's like, friends of mine that are, like, English professors , they say, 'It's the most brilliant thing I've ever seen.'""Asked for examples of the technique, the Trump campaign provided what it called a ""masterclass weave"" - a four-minute, 20-second video of the candidate speaking at a rally in , North Carolina, in Aug in which he bounces from energy bills to Hunter Biden's laptop to Venezuelan tar to mental institutions in Caracas to migrant crime to ""the green new scam"" to Vice-Prez Kamala Harris.His campaign didn't identify which English professor friends of his had complimented his style. ""I highly doubt that Trump has any English professor friends,"" said Timothy O'Brien, a Trump biographer. ""What this really reflects is that he is aware of the criticism that he is publicly saying nonlinear, nonsensical word salad, and he's trying to pretend there is a strategy behind it.""The weave - a word more commonly associated with tapestry, tailoring and cosmetology - is a new formulation for Trump. Certainly, in the history of narrative, there have been writers celebrated for their ability to be discursive only to cleverly tie together all their themes with a neat bow at the end - William Shakespeare, Charles Dickens and Larry David come to mind. But in the case of Trump, it is difficult to find the hermeneutic methods with which to parse the linguistic flights that take him from electrocuted sharks to Hannibal Lecter's cannibalism, windmills and Rosie O'Donnell. James Shapiro, a professor of English at Columbia University and a renowned Shakespeare scholar, ruminated about Trump's use of the word: ""I take him at his word, as one of the Oxford English Dictionary definitions of 'weave' is 'to pursue a devious course'.""Elaborating on his own oratorical technique Friday, Trump said: ""What you do is you get off a subject, to mention another little tidbit. Then you get back onto the subject, and you go through this, and you do it for two hours, and you don't even mispronounce one word.""","Donald Trump insists his oratory is not a campaign distraction but rather a rhetorical triumph.

France confronts horror of rape and drugging case as 51 men go on trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/france-confronts-horror-of-rape-and-drugging-case-as-51-men-go-on-trial/articleshow/113008290.cms,"PARIS: For years, she had been losing hair and weight. She had started forgetting whole days, and sometimes appeared to be in dreamlike trances. Her children and friends worried she had Alzheimer's. But in late 2020, after she was summoned to a police station in southern France , she learned a far more shattering story. Her husband of 50 years, Dominique Pelicot, had been crushing sleeping pills into her food and drink to put her into a deep sleep, police said, and then raping her.He had ushered dozens of men into her home to film them raping her, too, they said, in abuse that lasted nearly a decade.Using the man's photographs, videos and online messages, police spent the next two years identifying and charging those other suspects. On Monday, 51 men, including Pelicot, will go on trial in Avignon, in a case that has shocked France and cast a spotlight on the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse and the broader culture in which such crimes could occur.The accused men represent a kaleidoscope of working-class and middle-class French society: truck drivers, soldiers, carpenters and trade workers, a prison guard, a nurse, an IT expert working for a bank, a local journalist. They range in age from 26 to 74. Many have children and are in relationships. Most are charged with raping the woman once. A handful are accused of returning as many as six times to rape her.The victim, who has divorced her husband and changed her surname since his arrest, is now in her 70s. Since his arrest, Pelicot, 71, has ""always declared himself guilty"", said Beatrice Zavarro, his lawyer. ""He is not at all contesting his role."" Other defendants have denied the rape charges, with some arguing that they had the husband's permission and thought that was sufficient, while others claimed they believed the victim had agreed to be drugged.When police showed the victim some of the photographs they say her husband had carefully classified and stored, she expressed deep shock. She and her husband had been together since they were 18. She had described him to police as caring and considerate. She had no memory of being raped, by him or the other men, only one of whom she recognised, she told police, as a neighbour in town.The trial comes at a moment of heightened scrutiny of the handling of sexual crimes in the country. Rape is defined in French law as an ""act of sexual penetration"" committed ""by violence, coercion, threat or surprise"". A number of lawmakers want to amend that wording to say explicitly that sex without consent is rape, that consent can be withdrawn at any time, and that consent cannot exist if sexual assault is committed ""by abusing a state impairing the judgment of another."" ""There is a kind of naivete on the topic of predators in France, a kind of denial,"" said lawmaker Sandrine Josso.","51 men, including Dominique Pelicot, will go on trial in Avignon, in a case that has shocked France.

Poll insights and campaign implications

The 2024 presidential race tightened as Vice President Kamala Harris narrowly led Donald Trump , according to the latest poll data . With less than two months remaining until Election Day , Harris gained momentum and held a slight edge over her Republican rival.A new ABC News/Ipsos poll, released on Sunday, revealed that Harris led Trump 50% to 46% among all adults and registered voters.Among likely voters, Harris’ lead widened to 52% compared to Trump’s 46%. This result was consistent with polling conducted before the Democratic National Convention, where Harris stood at 49% and Trump at 45%.Pollsters noted that while most numbers remained stable since August, Harris gained ground among women, now leading by 13 points (54% to 41%), up from a 6-point lead before the convention. Harris also received higher marks for her campaign, with 56% of Americans rating her performance as excellent or good, compared to 41% for Trump.Harris outperformed Trump in the battleground states, maintaining a slight advantage within the margins of error in nearly every national survey. NBC News reported that Harris fared better against Trump than Biden did before his exit, indicating growing confidence in her leadership.The concept of a margin of error, as explained by Pew Research, refers to the range within which a survey result is expected to fall relative to the true population value. While Harris' lead was within this range, it underscored the competitive nature of the race.Despite Harris’ lead, Trump maintained advantages in areas critical to voters. He outperformed Harris on trust regarding key issues such as the economy and inflation, leading by 8 points in each category. Trump also had a 9-point lead over Harris on handling the US-Mexico border. However, Harris was perceived as more trustworthy on protecting American democracy and Supreme Court appointments.The latest polling index by The Hill and Decision Desk HQ also showed Harris with a 3.8-point national lead over Trump. The ABC News/Ipsos poll, conducted from August 23-27 with 2,496 completed interviews, had a margin of sampling error of 2.1 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.Despite Harris' gains, Trump remained a formidable opponent, consistently polling at around 47% nationwide. Polls conducted by The Wall Street Journal, EPIC-MRA in Michigan, and Bloomberg/Morning Consult in Georgia and Michigan all placed Trump at this level of support. However, the overall trend showed a reversal in fortunes since Biden's departure, with Harris now holding a narrow edge.Swing state polls revealed a complex and evolving landscape. Bloomberg/Morning Consult polls indicated that Harris had overtaken Trump within the margin of error in Georgia (50%), Michigan (49%), Nevada (50%), and Pennsylvania (51%). In Wisconsin, she held a more decisive lead at 53%, while she was tied with Trump in Arizona and North Carolina. This sharply contrasted with Biden’s performance in these states, where he struggled to gain traction.Before Harris took over the Democratic ticket, Biden trailed Trump, even before the June 27 debate that further damaged his campaign. Harris, on the other hand, was now seen as a more trusted leader and was performing better across the board.Additional polls from The Wall Street Journal, Quinnipiac, and Suffolk/USA Today also showed Harris in the lead, with percentages ranging from 48% to 49%. Trump remained close behind, polling between 43% and 48% in these surveys.The ABC News/Ipsos poll reflected Harris’ ability to leverage her campaign effectively, despite the race remaining highly competitive. Trump, while maintaining a solid base, faced challenges in closing the gap with Harris, who managed to capitalize on recent Democratic momentum.As both campaigns intensified their efforts, the upcoming weeks were crucial in determining whether Harris could sustain her lead or if Trump would make a comeback. With the presidential election just around the corner, all eyes were on how these dynamics evolved.","A new ABC News/Ipsos poll, released on Sunday, revealed that Harris led Trump 50% to 46% among all adults and registered voters.

Israeli PM Netanyahu pushes back against new pressure over Gaza and hostages: 'No one will preach to me',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/israeli-pm-netanyahu-pushes-back-against-new-pressure-over-gaza-and-hostages-no-one-will-preach-to-me/articleshow/113008020.cms,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday pushed back against mounting pressure for a cease-fire deal in Gaza . This resistance follows a weekend of massive protests in Israel and a critical stance from US President Joe Biden, who indicated that Netanyahu's efforts have been insufficient.In his first public address since the discovery of six dead hostages, Netanyahu reiterated his demand for continued Israeli control over the Philadelphi corridor, a critical area along Gaza's border with Egypt.""This is the oxygen of Hamas,"" Netanyahu declared, emphasizing his commitment to ensuring Hamas cannot rearm through tunnels. He added, ""No one is more committed to freeing the hostages than me. ... No one will preach to me on this issue.""The public response to the hostages' deaths has been fierce. Thousands of Israelis took to the streets on Sunday night, leading to what is considered the largest protest since the conflict began. Many blame Netanyahu for the hostages' deaths, arguing that a deal with Hamas could have spared them. Monday saw a rare general strike across the country, disrupting major sectors of the economy. Demonstrators gathered outside Netanyahu's residence and his Likud party headquarters, chanting, ""Deal. Now."" and carrying coffins draped in the Israeli flag. Scuffles broke out as police intervened, and several protesters were arrested.Despite this, some Israelis support Netanyahu's stance, believing that continuing the campaign against Hamas is necessary to secure a long-term resolution. Netanyahu has pledged ""total victory"" over Hamas and rejects a full withdrawal from Gaza, arguing that no other party could control Gaza's borders.The United States has shown impatience with the ongoing conflict. President Biden, after a Situation Room meeting with the US mediation team, expressed frustration, stating, ""No,"" when asked if Netanyahu was doing enough. He added, ""Hope springs eternal,"" indicating that negotiators are close to a deal but progress remains slow.Hamas has accused Israel of prolonging negotiations by adding new demands, including continued control over the Philadelphi corridor. The group has proposed releasing all hostages in exchange for ending the war, withdrawing Israeli forces, and releasing a significant number of Palestinian prisoners. Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya criticized Netanyahu, saying he deemed the corridor ""more important"" than winning the hostages' release.Tensions within Israel's security apparatus are evident, with reports of a heated argument between Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Gallant, who supports a cease-fire, criticized Netanyahu for prioritizing border security over the hostages' lives. ""Netanyahu was favoring border arrangements over the lives of hostages,"" an official revealed.The conflict, which began with Hamas' attack on October 7, has resulted in a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Over 40,000 Palestinians have been killed, and the region is experiencing widespread displacement and a worsening humanitarian situation.In the West Bank, Israeli raids on the Jenin refugee camp continue, with reports of significant destruction and casualties. Palestinian officials and human rights groups have raised concerns about the treatment of detainees and the overall impact of the Israeli military operations.As the situation remains fluid, the international community watches closely, hoping for a resolution that addresses both the immediate humanitarian needs and the long-term security concerns of all parties involved.","Netanyahu reiterates his demand for continued Israeli control over the Philadelphi corridor.

A pool reporter confirmed that at least one person appeared to have broken an arm and was receiving medical treatment at the scene.Despite the severity of the crash, Governor Walz was unharmed. He continued with his planned schedule, addressing the incident at a Labor Day event in Milwaukee shortly after the crash.

Harris’s running mate campaigns separately

US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris campaigned together for the first time Monday, marking a significant moment in their joint bid for the White House. Their appearance in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania, aimed to rally support in this crucial battleground state, highlighting their collaborative effort as the November 5 election nears.At the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union hall, Biden praised Harris’s candidacy and reaffirmed his support.""We have made a lot of progress, and Kamala and I are going to build on that progress,"" Biden stated. He emphasized his continued involvement in the campaign, even as he steps back from the forefront. ""I'll be on the sidelines, but I'll do everything I can to help,"" he added.Harris, who has been energized by recent rallies and fundraising success, expressed her admiration for Biden's presidency. ""Joe Biden has been one of the most transformative presidents in the United States that we have ever witnessed,"" she said. The vice president also highlighted their administration’s pro-union stance, resonating with the crowd’s chants of ""We’re not going back!""In contrast, Republican candidate Donald Trump took the weekend off from campaigning and had no public events on Labor Day. Harris’s campaign took a jab at Trump’s absence, questioning his commitment to workers. Trump, however, defended his economic record on his Truth Social platform, claiming that Harris and Biden have undone his achievements.Harris, who has been working to define her platform, faces scrutiny for her policy shifts, such as her reversal on banning fracking—a key issue in Pennsylvania. The state remains a pivotal battleground, and the joint appearance with Biden marks the beginning of the final push toward Election Day.As Labor Day traditionally signifies the end of summer and the start of the election sprint, Harris urged supporters to embrace the upcoming challenges. ""64 days until the most important election of our lives,"" she declared. ""We have some hard work then ahead of us. But here's the beauty of us in this room — we like our work. Hard work is good work.""Meanwhile, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Harris’s running mate, was separately campaigning in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as part of the broader effort to secure key states ahead of the November election.","US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris campaigned together for the first time Monday.

Biden says Netanyahu is not doing enough to free hostages in Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-says-netanyahu-is-not-doing-enough-to-free-hostages-in-gaza/articleshow/113007443.cms,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden issued a one-word rebuke Monday to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's commitment to reaching a cease-fire and hostage release deal, the latest iteration of the White House's monthslong effort to cajole and censure the Israeli leader.As he exited Marine One on the White House lawn on the way to a meeting of his national security team, Biden was asked a series of questions by waiting reporters about whether Netanyahu was doing enough to achieve a deal to get the hostages back.The president responded simply: ""no.""But as the advisers briefed Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, whose every utterance on the Israel-Hamas war is being examined for evidence that she is ready to shift administration policy, it became clear that far more than just Netanyahu's own political calculations was getting in the way of a preliminary hostage exchange and six-week cease-fire.While administration officials say that they have locked down 90% of the 18-paragraph-long preliminary accord, Hamas has still not approved a final list of which hostages would be released and who would be released in a first phase. In return, Israel would release a large number of Hamas fighters and other prisoners.Among those who had been expected to be freed were several of the six Israeli and American hostages who were executed over the weekend, apparently after their captors feared that an Israeli rescue operation was underway. One of them was Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, a dual American and Israeli citizen who had lost an arm trying to protect others during the Oct. 7 terror attack that precipitated the Israel-Hamas war.Hamas has demanded that all Israeli forces be withdrawn from the Philadelphi Corridor, a narrow strip of land, less than 9 miles long, on the border between theGaza Strip and Egypt. Netanyahu has said Israeli troops must remain in the corridor to prevent the movement of weapons and ammunition to Hamas.The draft agreement calls for a major reduction in Israeli forces in the corridor during the first phase of the cease-fire and full withdrawal thereafter. Israeli government negotiators have agreed to the phased withdrawal, but Netanyahu has backed away from that part of the deal, triggering an open dispute with his own defense minister, Yoav Gallant.""It is too late for the hostages who were murdered in cold blood,"" Gallant said Sunday, declaring that Netanyahu had to drop his insistence on the presence of troops in the corridor. ""We must bring back the hostages that are still being held by Hamas.""White House officials are considering pushing another ""final"" draft of the agreement in coming days, after the region has cooled off from the execution of the hostages.There have been other final drafts. A week and a half ago, White House and State Department officials said there would be a meeting of the negotiators, except for Hamas, to approve a final accord. That meeting never happened after Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader, rejected elements of it, and Netanyahu insisted on the continued military presence in the corridor.After the Situation Room meeting Monday, Biden said little about his strategy over the next days and weeks, including whether there would be a presentation of another final draft. ""We're in the middle of negotiations,"" Biden said to reporters after the meeting, on the way to a campaign event with Harris in Pennsylvania.Biden ignored a question about Netanyahu's defiant stance during a news conference in Israel on Monday, when the prime minister questioned what message it would send to Hamas after the deaths of the hostages if Israel let up in the fighting. ""Slay hostages and you'll get concessions?"" the prime minister said.Biden would only say that ""we're still in negotiations -- not with him, but with my colleagues from Qatar and Egypt.""Harris did not talk about the strategy. At the Democratic National Convention two weeks ago, she strongly backed Israel, while saying more had to be done to relieve the sufferings of the Palestinian people. But she has been careful to hew closely to the administration's current policy and deflected calls from the progressive wing of the party to cut off at least some weapons shipments to Israel, a step the British took Monday.The British decision puts its government and Washington at odds on the tactics for dealing with Netanyahu. Washington suspended export of 2,000-pound bombs earlier this year, saying their use could lead to wide civilian casualties and were not needed by the Israelis. But Britain has gone further. David Lammy, Britain's foreign secretary, said that a legal review concluded there was ""clear risk"" that a number of weapons would be used in ways that would breach international law. Biden and Harris have not reached a similar conclusion.Still, Biden and Netanyahu have clashed often in the past 10 months and with particular intensity since the spring. White House officials thought they were near a hostage deal in mid-July, one of several moments in which they believed -- and Biden publicly declared -- that the negotiations mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt would result in a temporary cease-fire, with hopes of a longer-lasting one.Other obstacles to a deal have come from Sinwar, who has been engaged in the negotiations remotely as he hides out, presumably underground in Gaza. Israeli military and intelligence officials, with American help, are hunting for Sinwar, considered the lead architect of the Oct. 7 attack that killed roughly 1,100 Israelis.",Biden and Netanyahu have clashed often in the past 10 months.

There are contradictory accounts of what Queen Elizabeth II thought about former US president Donald Trump , his marriage with Melania . But now we know what Trump thought about the Queen.

Brown wrote in his book A Voyage Around the Queen that the Queen confided in a lunch guest that Trump was always looking over her shoulder as if he was looking for something more interesting. Brown claimed that the Queen also believed that Trump had some kind of an arrangement with Melania.Trump election campaign dismissed the claim and said it was a fake news intended to sell more copies of the book. ""This is nothing more than fake news intended to use made-up, salacious fabrications in order to sell copies of a book that belongs in the bargain bin of the fiction section,"" Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director said.In the wake of the 'rude' claim, Donald Trump told Daily Mail that it was just the opposite. He was her favorite president, Trump said claiming that Queen told that to many people. “We spent hours together at a state dinner. She was a fantastic woman. I think it’s a shame that a sleaze bag can write an article that’s totally false.

Arlington spat puts spotlight on Trump’s role in Afghanistan fiasco,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/arlington-spat-puts-spotlight-on-trumps-role-in-afghanistan-fiasco/articleshow/113001977.cms,"WASHINGTON: Several ""Gold Star"" military families ripped into Kamala Harris on Sunday, holding her administration responsible for the death of their beloved in the botched US withdrawal from Kabul three years ago even as the fierce controversy over Donald Trump 's visit to the Arlington cemetery last week brought attention to his role in the American debacle in Afghanistan.Pushing back at the MAGA narrative that the Biden-Harris administration alone was responsible for the fiasco that culminated in the death of 13 US military personnel in a suicide bombing, Gen H.R.McMaster, who served as Trump's National Security Advisor before resigning in 2018, underscored the former President's role in the disaster by negotiating with the Taliban, including inviting them to Camp David, and throwing the Afghan government under the bus.Compounding that mistake the Trump administration released 5000 of the most heinous people and literally handing over the country to Taliban, McMaster said in a TV interview, while other critics said his decision to reduce US troops to 2500 was an invitation to disaster.Those released in the Trump deal included Abdul Ghani Baradar, Afghanistan's current deputy Prime minister, whom Trump frequently refers to only by his first name, while claiming that his threat to bomb ""Abdool"" by sending him a satellite photo of his house prevented US casualties.Meanwhile, the Trump campaign tapped into the anger of eight of the 13 Gold Star family members to release a video in which they excoriated Harris for not reaching out to them, and said they had invited Trump for the memorial and were honoured he attended the event. ""Are you in my shoes? I invited him. My son was murdered under the Biden-Harris administration,"" Gold Star mom Kelly Hoover told NBC when asked if it was “appropriate” for Trump to visit Arlington National Cemetery.Trump surrogates also sought to pin Harris to the tragedy citing her statement that she was the ""last person in the room"" -- a vice-presidential template to assert their inclusion when crucial decisions are made.""The media tried to make a story out of Trump showing up. The real story is that these families lost their loved ones because Kamala Harris is incompetent, and they're rightfully pissed off about it,"" Trump's running mate JD Vance tweeted.But there were also family members of other military personnel killed in Afghanistan who were critical of what they saw as Trump's grandstanding on the issue. ""You can’t stand on the graves of better men who fought and died for this country while you rip apart that country with your incompetence,"" Marine Widow Kait Wyatt, who lost her husband in Afghanistan, said on an emotive issue that is dividing the US service personnel.In a counteroffensive, the anti-Trump veteran's group VoteVets released an ad listing some of Trump's most offensive and egregious comments on the military, including calling fallen soldiers ""losers"" and ""suckers,"" which Trump denies even though he has publicly disparaged war heroes and service in the military, including flippantly claiming a civilian medal is better than a military honour because it did not involve sacrifice.

It was not clear whether Walz could not hear the question like it's not known in today's video whether Kamala Harris was actually on the phone.Biden-Harris administration came under fire for the hostage crisis as they headed into the situation room. Biden blamed Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu for not doing enough to push for a hostage deal.","Kamala Harris has not addressed a press conference after becoming the Democratic presidential nominee. She gave an interview to CNN alongside her running mate Tim Walz. In the video, as Harris boarded her jet, she waved to the cameras and then went inside. She had a wired earplug attached to her phone. The Trump campaign insinuated that Harris was actually pretending to be on the phone in order to avoid answering questions from the press.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113001537,imgsize-317648,width-400,resizemode-4/113001537.jpg"
Anti-terror op turns sinister: Pakistani netizens being 'walled off' as army raises spectre of 'digital terrorism',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/anti-terror-op-turns-sinister-pakistani-netizens-being-walled-off-as-army-raises-spectre-of-digital-terrorism/articleshow/112898501.cms,"Munir's repeated attacks on social media

Imran's ouster & rise of digital activism

National internet firewall

NEW DELHI: Pakistan 's ""whole-of-system approach"" to countering militancy is evolving and may be taking a turn to the sinister as its army's new anti-terror operation ' Azm-e-Istehkam ' (Resolve for Stability) is increasingly focusing on what it calls "" digital terrorism "".Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir has over the past few months repeatedly warned that digital platforms are being exploited to disseminate misinformation and incite unrest against state institutions.He described the activities of ""inimical"" forces as a form of ""digital terrorism"" aimed at creating discord between the military and the public by spreading ""lies and fake news"".Launched in June, Azm-e-Istehkam is tackling not only traditional militancy, particularly in light of increasing attacks attributed to groups like the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), but the evolving nature of threats in the digital landscape.The shift has sparked widespread concern with some analysts suggesting that the military is carrying out ""prejudiced online surveillance"" and curbing internet speeds across the country to battle the new ""digital threat"".The characterisation of digital terrorism in Munir's speeches have been notably vague, with rights activists noting that the term lacks a clear legal definition and could be weaponised against individuals who express criticism of the military or government policies online.In recent months, Munir has repeatedly voiced ""concerns"" regarding the impact of social media on national security and public discourse.In May -- just months before launching Azm-e-Istehkam -- Munir highlighted the issue of ""negative propaganda"" on social media, asserting that it poses threats to the integrity and security of Pakistan. He emphasised the military's readiness to counter any conspiracies and condemned the spread of disinformation, urging adherence to constitutional limits on freedom of expression, particularly as outlined in Article 19 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which restricts incitement to violence and undermining national security.In August, Munir reiterated these concerns, stating that social media is being exploited to propagate ""anarchy"" and warned against campaigns targeting the military. His remarks came in the context of rising tensions and comparisons being drawn to political instability in neighboring countries.On August 14, he again criticised the misuse of social media for spreading chaos and false information, attributing ""digital terrorism"" to foreign elements. He stressed the state's responsibility to protect citizens from the adverse effects of social media-driven hysteria and urged the public to remain vigilant against misinformation.He also warned that social media was being exploited to propagate ""anarchy"". His remarks that ""anarchy is spread through social media"" followed a condemnation by the army of social media campaigns to target the Pakistan Armed Forces.""Just as terrorists use weapons to get their demands met, digital terrorists use negative propaganda and fake news on social media platforms, mobiles and computers to create despondency to get their demands met,"" Pakistani military spokesperson Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had said.Chaudhry said the military had become the sole target of digital terrorists, and blamed a ""certain"" political party without naming ousted PM Imran Khan ’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf party, which has a formidable social media presence.Imran Khan has repeatedly accused the military for orchestrating his removal from power in April 2022, and specifically named Munir as being responsible for his subsequent arrest in May 2023, claiming the Army chief harboured a ""personal grudge"" against him.Khan also alleged that Munir was behind the crackdown on his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), stating: ""It is personal. It's got nothing to do with national interest"". He also accused Munir of ""dismantling the future of this country [Pakistan] to protect himself"".Khan's arrest led to riots in May where protesters for the first time in the nation's history vented their anger on the military attacking several army installations.Digital activism in Pakistan spiked following Imran's ouster, whose party has relied heavily on social media to coordinate its activities. After TV channels were banned from covering PTI events, Khan gave several speeches online challenging the military's role in politics.These online events were often marred by internet blackouts or slowdown. Though authorities have said the drop in internet speed was due to technical issues, activists have claimed that the army is strategically using a national firewall and manipulating the country's internet infrastructure to curb any dissenting voices on the web.Pakistan has experienced a notable slowdown in internet speeds over the past few months, with reports indicating that up to 40% slower speeds have affected nearly half of the country's 241 million internet users.Users have reported difficulties in sending and receiving messages on platforms like WhatsApp and accessing social media sites, which are crucial for communication and information dissemination, especially among the youth and political activists.Information Technology minister Shiza Fatima Khawaja has confirmed that it was upgrading its ""web management system"" to cope with cybersecurity threats but did not link the development to slower internet speeds.TOI has reported that the Pakistan government tested its firewall on two occasions, once in July and a second time in mid-August. Pakistan has allocated more than $70 million for a Digital Infrastructure Development Initiative in the latest budget.The timing of these frequent slowdowns also coincides with the launch of operation Azm-e-Istehkam, raising questions about whether the internet disruptions are also linked to efforts to control information amid rising political tensions and protests against the military's actions.Technology experts have suggested that the newly implemented internet firewall could provide the government with enhanced capabilities to censor online content, drawing comparisons to China's stringent internet regulations.Countries like China, Iran, Turkiye, and Russia have employed national firewalls for years to regulate internet content, saying they aim to pinpoint and restrict sources of propaganda content.","Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir has repeatedly warned that digital platforms are being exploited to disseminate misinformation and incite unrest against state institutions.

Attacks in Balochistan bid to derail SCO summit in October: Pakistan govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/attacks-in-balochistan-bid-to-derail-sco-summit-in-october-pakistan-govt/articleshow/112974277.cms,"ISLAMABAD: A surge in daring militant attacks across Pakistan’s volatile provinces of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has raised questions about the country’s internal security situation . Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said the attacks were aimed at derailing the SCO heads of govt meeting in Islamabad on Oct 15-16.Amid heightened political polarisation in Pakistan, both Baloch separatists and Islamic militants, known as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), have intensified their attacks on security personnel and their facilities in the country’s southwest and northwest.The Baloch separatists also target people of Punjabi ethnicity in the province.On Aug 26, more than 70 people were killed in targeted killings and suicide bombings in different districts of Balochistan, while in Kulachi tehsil of Dera Ismail Khan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.In a separate incident, a senior army officer, Lt Col Khalid Ameer, and three of his relatives, were kidnapped by TTP fighters when they were meeting people on their father’s death in Dera Ismail Khan. The army’s media wing, however, said on Sunday they have been released due to the role played by tribal elders.When the separatist militant outfit, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), bombed a railway bridge linking Balochistan to the rest of Pakistan, attacked police and military posts, and targeted buses and trucks on a major highway, Pakistan’s Army chief General Asim Munir was meeting General Li Qiaoming, Commander of the People’s Liberation Army, in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. The bombings and shootings on August 25-26 were the deadliest in years in Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran.Former Balochistan chief minister, Abdul Malik Baloch, said disappointment is pushing people into insurgency. “Many Baloch are losing faith in Islamabad because of what they perceive to be its political intervention in the province. Political activists tell me that democracy here is a fraud. They feel we are wasting their time,” Baloch said.BLA’s coordinated attacks in Balochistan on Aug 25–26 demonstrated their growing strength. It is believed that US military hardware and weaponry have found their way into the hands of Pakistani militant organisations. Military equipment and weapons, worth billions of dollars, were left behind by the US and international forces following their withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. BLA’s acquisition of modern weapons, security experts believe, has enhanced its combat capabilities.Majority of BLA’s sophisticated strikes are thought to have been executed by the group’s suicide squad, known as Majeed Brigade.Islamabad blames Kabul for patronising Baloch separatists and the TTP. Qari Fasihuddin Fitrat, the military chief of Afghan Taliban , denied the accusation saying the militants plan and execute attacks from within Pakistan.","Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said the attacks were aimed at derailing the SCO heads of govt meeting in Islamabad on Oct 15-16.

Pakistan's Karachi University deems high court judge's degree invalid after 40 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-karachi-university-deems-high-court-judges-degree-invalid-after-40-years/articleshow/112966620.cms,"ISLAMABAD : The syndicate of the University of Karachi on Sunday cancelled the degree of a high court Judge at the Unfair Means Committee's recommendation, Dawn reported, quoting its university sources.The announcement came after the alleged ""illegal detention"" of a syndicate member Raiz Ahmed by three police stations on Saturday, Dawn reported.Ahmed said that he objected to an agenda which involved Islamabad high court judge Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri's degree which was issued 40 years ago, Dawn reported.After Ahmed was allegedly kidnapped on Saturday- probably to prevent him from attending the meeting- the meeting went ahead without him and the syndicate decided to cancel the judge's degree, reported Dawn.A statement by Karachi University , without naming anyone, said, ""The members also approved the recommendations of the KU UFM [unfair means] Committee which has proposed cancellation of the degree and enrolment cards of the candidate(s) who were found in unethical and immoral acts.""The fracas started after an application sought information on Jahangiri's LLB degree under Sindh Transparency Right to Information Act, 2016. The application stated that candidate Jahangiri obtained his LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968.But, one Imtiaz Ahmed enrolled in 1987 bore the same enrolment number as Jahangiri, while while the transcript for LLB Part I was issued under the name of Jahangiri. Jahangiri enrolled for LLB Part I under enrolment number 7124. The university deemed the degree invalid , claiming that they issue only one enrolment number per degree programme, making it impossible for a candidate to have multiple enrolment numbers, Dawn reported.Jahangiri had earlier complained to the Supreme Judicial Council about the Chief Justice and said that the Inter-Services Intelligence interfered in judicial affairs. He also said that spy cameras were detected in the bedroom and entrance of a judge's house and the matter was reported to Chief Justice but no action was taken in response, Dawn stated.","The announcement came after the alleged ""illegal detention"" of a syndicate member Raiz Ahmed by three police stations on Saturday.

As Pakistan grapples with a surge in terrorist strikes in the past couple of years, its restive Balochistan province was rocked this week by a wave of attacks that have left more than 70 dead. The coordinated strikes, perhaps more widespread than any such assault in the past, by the separatist Baloch Liberation Army ( BLA ), have again foregrounded Baloch insurgency fuelled by decades of neglect and exploitation of impoverished Balochistan's natural resources as the soft underbelly of Pakistan.The attacks, which saw BLA targeting police stations and taking control of major highways, coincided with the death anniversary of Baloch leader Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, who was killed 18 years ago in one of then president Pervez Musharraf's counter-insurgency operations.","Baloch insurgency fuelled by decades of neglect and exploitation of impoverished Balochistan's natural resources.
