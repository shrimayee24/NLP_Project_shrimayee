The arrests took place in the Bahraich district of Uttar Pradesh.Those arrested were Shiv Kumar Gautam, alias Shiva - resident of Gandara village, Kaiserganj, Bahraich (main shooter), Anurag Kashyap - resident of Gandara village, Kaiserganj, Bahraich (brother of shooter Dharmraj Kashyap, aide), Gyan Prakash Tripathi - resident of Gandara village, Kaiserganj, Bahraich (aide/helper) and Akash Srivastava - resident of Gandara village, Kaiserganj, Bahraich (aide/helper) and Akhileshendra Pratap Singh - resident of Gandara village, Kaiserganj, Bahraich (aide/helper).STF said that on the night of October 12, 2024, three unknown shooters killed Ziauddin Abdul Rahim Siddiqui, popularly known as Baba Siddiqui, near the office of his son, Zishan Siddiqui, in Khairnagar, Thane, Mumbai. Baba Siddiqui, a former Maharashtra minister and close associate of actor Salman Khan, was killed in a well-orchestrated attack.The murder was registered at Nirmal Nagar police station, Thane, Mumbai. During the investigation, two shooters, Dharmraj Kashyap and Gurmel Singh, were arrested, but one of the shooters, Shiv Kumar, managed to escape.The arrested shooters revealed that the murder was carried out on the orders of notorious gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who is currently serving a prison sentence. Bishnoi's associates, Shubham Lonkar from Maharashtra and Mohammad Yaseen Akhtar from Jalandhar, were identified as the handlers who provided logistics and information regarding the victim's location.On October 23, 2024, the Mumbai Police requested assistance from the Uttar Pradesh STF to arrest Shiv Kumar and other fugitives involved in the murder.It was during this operation that information surfaced that Shiv Kumar was hiding in Bahraich, planning to escape to Nepal.On November 10, 2024, the STF team, in collaboration with the Mumbai Crime Branch, gathered crucial intelligence from a tip-off and proceeded to the Nainapara area of Bahraich.According to the information, Shiv Kumar and his accomplices were preparing to flee to Nepal and were hiding near Harabhasri Nahar Pulliya. At this location, the STF and Mumbai crime branch teams arrested Shiv Kumar and four others.Deputy SP of STF Pramesh Shukla, said that during questioning, Shiv Kumar revealed that he and Dharmraj Kashyap hailed from the same village and had previously worked together in Pune in the scrap business.“Shiv Kumar also disclosed that he had been in contact with Shubham Lonkar, who worked for Lawrence Bishnoi. Through Snapchat, he communicated with Anmol Bishnoi, the brother of Lawrence, who instructed him to carry out the murder in exchange for a promised payment of Rs 10 lakh and ongoing financial support,” said ShuklaShiv Kumar further explained that he and his fellow shooters, including Dharmraj, were involved in surveillance of Baba Siddiqui for several days before executing the murder on the night of October 12, 2024. He also mentioned that the attack took place during a festival, which helped them blend into the crowd, resulting in the arrest of two of the shooters while Shiv Kumar managed to escape.After fleeing Mumbai, Shiv Kumar travelled through Pune, Jhansi, and Lucknow before reaching Bahraich. He had been in constant contact with his handlers and accomplices throughout the journey. According to Shiv Kumar, his associates, Anurag Kashyap, Gyan Prakash Tripathi, Akash Srivastava, and Akhileshendra Pratap Singh, had made arrangements for his escape to Nepal.","Baba Siddiqui, a former Maharashtra minister and close associate of actor Salman Khan, was killed in a well-orchestrated attack.

NEW DELHI: A tense situation prevailed outside the High Commission of Canada in New Delhi on Sunday as hundreds of members of the Hindu Sikh Global Forum staged a protest in Chanakyapuri against the recent attacks and vandalism of Hindu temples in Canada.Heavy security was deployed outside the High Commission and the protesters were stopped at Teen Murti Marg by the police. Several activists were seen attempting to climb over the police barricades and toppling them.""An entire generation had been destroyed during militancy. They were either killed or they migrated to other countries. Then they introduced drugs to ruin the life of our young generation. When they saw Punjab was thriving, they started with religious conversions. And now this new thing of attacking temples has started. This is wrong and unfortunate ... We are here to tell you that we are all together. A true Sikh can never be a Khalistani. If they want a separate nation, they should keep it limited to themselves. We want our Tricolour and our country to be respected at all times. India's Sikhs stand with India and do not support Khalistan,"" said Tarvinder Singh Marwah, president of the Hindu Sikh Global Forum.The protest was a direct response to a series of violent incidents targeting Hindu temples in Canada, particularly an attack on November 3 at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton. The incident allegedly involved pro-Khalistani extremists who clashed with Hindu-Canadian devotees, resulting in physical violence and injuries.The situation has drawn condemnation from both Indian officials and Canadian politicians, highlighting concerns over rising anti-Hindu sentiment in Canada.Following the attack, massive protests erupted outside the Brampton temple, with demonstrations also taking place in Mississauga. A Canadian police officer, Harinder Sohi, was suspended for participating in a pro-Khalistan protest where anti-India slogans were chanted.Canadian authorities have so far arrested four people in connection with the violence and demonstrations. Inderjeet Gosal, a top official of the Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a banned organisation in India, has also been arrested.Gosal, who was an associate of slain Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, has been charged with assault with a weapon.In response to the ongoing violence in Canada, officials of the external affairs ministry have condemned the attacks and urged Canadian authorities to ensure the safety of Indian nationals and places of worship.External affairs minister S. Jaishankar described the attacks and vandalism as ""deeply concerning"", while Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed expectations for justice from Canadian law enforcement.Bilateral relations between India and Canada came under severe strain following Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September last year of a ""potential"" involvement of Indian agents in Khalistan extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing.New Delhi rejected Trudeau's charges as ""absurd"".India has been maintaining that the main issue between the two countries is that of Canada giving space to pro-Khalistan elements operating from Canadian soil with impunity.","Hundreds of members of the Hindu Sikh Global Forum staged a protest in Chanakyapuri.

HYDERABAD: Around 15 to 20 tigers have been missing for years from Telangana’s northern tiger corridors, covering Kagaznagar, Asifabad, and Mancherial regions, claim wildlife activists.Prominent names such as Chaitra, Vaishaka, and Phalguna have not been seen since 2013, they claim. In Jan 2024, an adult tiger and a sub-adult were found poisoned to death in Kagaznagar. Two more of the same family are still missing. Wildlife activists claim only four to five tigers remain in Kagaznagar, that once had at least 15.The forest department’s response to these claims is mixed. “There’s no problem in Amrabad Tiger Reserve,” said a forest official on condition of anonymity, “but in areas outside reserves, we see tigers disappearing”.Telangana’s principal chief conservator of forests, R M Dobriyal, said, “The tigers are there. Some have migrated to Maharashtra and some have returned around Kawal. Recently, we recorded a cattle kill in Kagaznagar so we know there are at least five tigers there.”The forest department says their absence was potentially due to gaps in camera trap coverage.However, state’s chief wildlife warden Elusing Meru said, “It is a fact that there are no resident tigers at present but we are hoping that the inviolate areas created by relocation of two villages recently will make it an ideal habitat.”“In Adilabad, Tiryani, and Chennur, we saw about five tigers. But the tigers in Kawal Tiger Reserve have vanished over the years,” said an official from Aranya Bhavan.","Prominent names such as Chaitra, Vaishaka, and Phalguna have not been seen since 2013.

MUMBAI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Sunday emphasising India’s confidence in its ties with the US despite global concerns, highlighted PM Narendra Modi’s rapport with successive US Presidents and his ability to build strong relationships ranging from from Barack Obama to Donald Trump and Joe Biden.Speaking at an event in Mumbai, Jaishankar was asked about the impact of the recent presidential election in the United States on Indo-US relations, especially considering Prime Minister Modi’s strong personal rapport with President-elect Trump.“...The PM was among the first three calls I think that President Trump took. PM Modi has actually built rapport across multiple presidents. When he first came to DC, Obama was the president, then it was Trump, then it was Biden. So, you know, for him, there’s something natural in terms of how he forges those relationships. So, that’s helped hugely,” Jaishankar said in his response.The foreign minister further highlighted India’s position, noting that unlike many other countries India is not anxious about the latest outcome of the US presidential elections.“And I think, the changes in India have helped as well. I know today a lot of countries are nervous about the US. Let’s be honest about it.

Michalski, who had been vacationing in Budapest, was reported missing on November 5 after a night out in the city.Authorities identified the suspect, who police referred to by the initials L.T.M., through security footage from a local nightclub, which showed Michalski and the man interacting before heading to his rented apartment. Officials stated that the suspect later confessed to the killing, claiming it was accidental, but attempted to cover it up by concealing Michalski’s body.According to police, Michalski and the suspect met at a nightclub in Budapest, where they were seen dancing together before moving to the suspect’s apartment. Officers reported that she was killed during an ""intimate encounter,"" though further details were not provided.To hide Michalski’s body, police said the suspect placed it in a wardrobe while cleaning his apartment to remove evidence of the incident. He then purchased a suitcase, placed her body inside, and rented a car to transport it to a wooded area near the village of Szigliget, about 90 miles from Budapest. In a video released by police, the suspect, in handcuffs, is seen leading investigators to the location where he had hidden Michalski’s body, with sniffer dogs and forensic specialists aiding in the search.The suspect reportedly made a series of online searches following the killing, including phrases like, “what does a dead body smell like after it decomposes?” and “how do the police handle missing person cases?” Police also reported he searched whether pigs eat dead bodies and researched wild boar populations near Lake Balaton, a body of water close to where he had disposed of Michalski’s body. He also allegedly searched about the competence of Budapest police.A Facebook group titled “Find Mackenzie Michalski,” created on November 7, confirmed Michalski’s death in a post, expressing gratitude for the ""prompt attention, diligence, care, and consideration"" of US and Hungarian authorities. A vigil was held near the US Embassy in Budapest on Saturday to honour Michalski, who was described by friends as a nurse practitioner known for her “humor, positivity, and limitless empathy.”Michalski’s parents have reportedly traveled to Hungary following the news.

Seven deadly wins: Trump takes Arizona for a clean sweep of the battleground states,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/seven-deadly-wins-trump-takes-arizona-for-a-clean-sweep-of-the-battleground-states/articleshow/115144912.cms,"Donald Trump (File photo)

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

MAGA supremo Donald Trump has flipped Arizona, the last state to officially declare results on Saturday to sweep all seven battleground states in the 2024 presidential election . With this, Trump has chalked up 312 electoral votes to Kamala Harris ' 226 to complete a remarkable win, reversing his loss to Biden in 2020, when the outgoing President won 306-232.Trump has won 74.6 million votes (50.5 per cent) to Harris' 71 million (48 per cent) so far, with some votes still to be counted, to win by around 2.5 per cent popular votes nationwide, attesting to a still divided national despite his seemingly sweeping win. Harris has polled 10 million fewer votes than Joe Biden 's 81 million in 2020, leading to much handwringing and soul-searching among Democrats still trying to figure out if and why so many Democratic voters bailed out on Kamala Harris despite visible enthusiasm on the ground.Conspiracy theorists are still kvetching about elections that were ""stolen,"" with the hashtag ""cheated"" trending on social media amid suspicions that there was some jiggery-pokery to boost Trump's tally. MAGA principals on the other hand say the only cheating occurred in 2020 when Biden logged a fantastic 81 million votes, nearly 15 million more votes than Hillary Clinton got in 2016.The President-elect trolled Democrats for their loss despite a massive financial advantage with the Harris campaign raising more than $ 1 billion for the elections. ""I am very surprised that the Democrats, who fought a hard and valiant fight in the 2020 Presidential Election, raising a record amount of money, didn’t have lots of $’s left over. Now they are being squeezed by vendors and others. Whatever we can do to help them during this difficult period, I would strongly recommend we, as a Party and for the sake of desperately needed UNITY, do,"" Trump posted on social media, adding, ""We have a lot of money left over in that our biggest asset in the campaign was “Earned Media,” and that doesn’t cost very much.""Trump also has signaled he's going to govern differently from 2016 -- with new personnel in his cabinet and senior ranks -- when he was unprepared and surprised to find himself in the White House. Under pressure from MAGA rank and file to dispense with anyone remotely critical of him during his time out of office, he announced on Saturday that he will ""not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley , or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to join the Trump Administration, which is currently in formation,"" while thanking them for their past service. Haley, who fought him for the Republican nomination and had been critical of him before finally endorsing him, wished him success.There is also wide-spread apprehension that he will purge the Pentagon of top commanders who do not hew to his line, given his pledge to during the campaign to fire so-called ""woke"" generals. Some generals are already said to be informally discussing how to respond if Trump should order them into action against civilians or to round up immigrants, as he has sometimes promised to do. The MAGA supremo sees Washington's military and strategic establishment as perpetual war-mongers and has expressed disdain for America's endless wars, while at the same time talking up the US military in what his supporters see as a ""peace through strength"" policy.The President-elect will be in almost total control of Washington DC when he takes oath of office on January 20, 2025, with only the final tally from the elections to the House of Representatives due. Republicans lead 212-202, with 218 required for a majority, which they are expected to achieve narrowly. In that event, MAGA Republicans will control the White House, the Senate, the House, and the US Supreme Court for a full-court press to fundamentally remake the United States of America."," MAGA supremo Donald Trump has flipped Arizona, the last state to officially declare results on Saturday to sweep all seven battleground states in the 2024 presidential election.

(Picture credit: AP)

Southern Cuba was struck by two powerful earthquakes on Sunday, just days after the island was battered by Hurricane Rafael and Oscar.According to the US Geological Survey, the first tremor, measuring 5.9 magnitude, occurred at around 11 am (local time) off the coast of Bartolome Maso in Granma province. An hour later, a more intense 6.8 magnitude quake hit the same area at a depth of 14.6 miles.The quakes caused widespread panic, with residents rushing into the streets in fear, especially after enduring severe weather conditions earlier in the week.Despite the severe impact, the US Tsunami Warning System confirmed that there was no tsunami threat from the earthquakes.The earthquakes damaged homes and infrastructure, particularly in eastern and central Cuba. State media reported cracked walls, collapsed roofs, and damaged power lines in towns like Bayamo, Santiago de Cuba, and Caney de las Mercedes.According to the news agency AFP, no fatalities have been reported so far despite the damage.The quakes have compounded the difficulties for many residents who are already facing hours-long power cuts and a severe economic crisis marked by soaring inflation and shortages of basic goods.Residents of Bayamo, a city with a population of around 140,000, described the intense shaking, with street poles swaying and homes rattling. In Santiago de Cuba, the island's second-largest city, buildings trembled, and people scrambled to safety.Livan Chavez, a welder from Bayamo, told AFP, ""People got scared. Everyone came running out of the houses very scared."" Another resident, Karen Rodriguez, noted that some homes in her small town had walls and roofs collapse.These tremors come as Cuba struggles to recover from a series of natural and man-made disasters. The island was recently hit by Hurricane Oscar , which caused widespread damage, and Hurricane Rafael, which knocked out the national power grid, leaving millions without electricity.The ongoing crisis has sparked rare protests, leading to the arrest of several individuals, as residents voiced their frustration over the prolonged blackouts and worsening living conditions.Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel addressed the nation via social media, acknowledging the damage and promising that efforts to assess and repair the destruction were underway. He emphasised that the government's priority is to ""save lives"" amidst these overlapping crises.The region around Santiago de Cuba is no stranger to seismic activity, as it sits near the fault line separating the North American and Caribbean plates. Local experts reported that over 15 aftershocks were felt following the initial quakes, prompting authorities to warn residents to stay alert for further tremors.The dual disasters of hurricanes and earthquakes have left much of Cuba’s eastern region in dire need of aid and recovery efforts.","Southern Cuba was struck by two powerful earthquakes on Sunday.

Sometimes the votes can take two years, or more. This is what they did four years ago, and we cannot let it happen again. We need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!” Trump posted on X.“Additionally, no Judges should be approved during this period of time because the Democrats are looking to ram through their Judges as the Republicans fight over Leadership. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. THANK YOU!” he added.The secret ballot contest features Republican Senators John Thune (South Dakota), John Cornyn (Texas) and Rick Scott (Florida), who are competing to succeed long-serving GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who is departing after nearly 20 years.The three candidates have sought Trump's backing, each attempting to demonstrate their allegiance to the president-elect whilst campaigning for the majority leader position.Since a 2014 Supreme Court decision restricted presidential authority for recess appointments, the Senate has prevented such actions. The chamber maintains brief ""pro-forma"" sessions during extended breaks exceeding 10 days to prevent unconfirmed appointments during Senate absences.With Trump’s approval crucial to the race, each of the three candidates promptly indicated openness to revisiting the practice. Scott responded to Trump, stating, “I 100% agree. I’ll do whatever it takes to expedite your nominations.”Thune issued a statement emphasising the need for swift action regarding nominees, indicating that ""all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments.""Cornyn said: ""It is unacceptable for Senate Ds to blockade President @realDonaldTrump 's cabinet appointments. If they do, we will stay in session, including weekends, until they relent."" He referenced the constitutional provision for recess appointments, Associated Press reported.This social media interaction served as an initial assessment for the candidates following Trump's decisive re-election the previous week.Trump's initial term was marked by tensions with Congress, particularly regarding the Senate's constitutional role in confirming nominations. Following his substantial electoral victory, he has begun indicating clear expectations for Senate Republicans and their future leader regarding his Cabinet choices.Trump additionally posted about preventing judicial approvals before the Republican takeover, though this presents challenges as Democrats maintain control until January 3.The leadership contest remains uncertain with Thune and Cornyn, both former McConnell deputies, considered leading candidates despite previous Trump criticisms. Scott, though initially considered unlikely, has launched an energetic campaign seeking Trump's support.Scott has received endorsements from Trump-aligned senators Lee and Rubio, alongside Elon Musk. During his Fox News appearance, Scott said, ""We have to be the change. That's what Donald Trump got elected to do, to be the change.""The candidates have committed to greater transparency than McConnell offered, promising increased senatorial influence. They've distanced themselves from McConnell's relationship with Trump, noting McConnell's private criticism of the former president.Regarding Cabinet appointments, Trump's supporters continue their advocacy. Vivek Ramaswamy mentioned on ABC's ""This Week"" about ""a couple of great options on the table.""Former ambassador Hagerty, who supports Scott, expressed on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" his pride in representing Trump's administration, stating, ""I'll do that in whatever role necessary.”",President-elect Donald Trump urged the next Senate Republican leaders to back the use of recess appointments.

Pardon Capitol rioters:

Dismantle the ‘deep state’:

Impose tariffs on imports:

Drill, drill, drill:

WASHINGTON: In Dec last year, Donald Trump stated he wouldn’t be a dictator — “except for Day 1”. According to his own words, he’s got a lot to do on that first day in the White House. “I want to close the border, and I want to drill, drill, drill,” he said. A look at what he has said he will do in his second term:Trump has said “within two seconds” of taking office that he would fire the special counsel who has been prosecuting two federal cases against him. Trump can’t pardon himself when it comes to his state conviction in New York in a hush money case, but he could seek to leverage his status to expunge his felony conviction. A case in Georgia, on poll interference, will likely be the only case left. It would probably be put on hold until 2029.Last month, Trump said: “On Day 1, I will launch the largest deportation programme in American history to get the criminals out.” He can begin the effort the minute he arrives in office, but it’s much more complicated to deport the nearly 11 million people who are believed to be in the US illegally. That would require a huge law enforcement force, massive detention facilities, airplanes to move people and nations willing to accept them.Over 1,500 people have been charged since a mob of Trump supporters attacked the Capitol in 2021. Trump has called the rioters “unbelievable patriots”. As prez, he can pardon anyone convicted and stop prosecution.Trump could begin the process of stripping career employees of their civil service protections, so they could be more easily fired. He wants to “totally obliterate the deep state” — perceived enemies in govt jobs.Trump vowed to impose tariffs on imported goods, particularly those from China, in bid to keep manufacturing jobs in the US.He is looking to reverse climate policies. He has pledged to increase production of fossil fuels, promising to “drill, drill, drill”.","Trump has said “within two seconds” of taking office that he would fire the special counsel who has been prosecuting two federal cases against him.

Who gets to keep the ring if engagement’s off? US court rules always the buyer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-gets-to-keep-the-ring-if-engagements-off-us-court-rules-always-the-buyer/articleshow/115157619.cms,"Representative photo

That’s what the highest court in Massachusetts was asked to decide with a $70,000 ring at the centre of the dispute. The court ultimately ruled that an engagement ring must be returned to the person who purchased it, ending a six-decade state rule that required judges to try to identify who was to blame for the end of the relationship.The case involved Bruce Johnson and Caroline Settino, who started dating in the summer of 2016, according to court filings. Over the next year, they travelled together across the United States and to Italy. Johnson paid for the vacations and also gave Settino jewellery, clothing, shoes and handbags. Eventually, Johnson bought a $70,000 diamond ring and in Aug 2017 asked Settino’s father for permission to marry her.Johnson said he felt like after that Settino became increasingly critical and unsupportive, including berating him and not accompanying him to treatments when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, according to court filings. At some point Johnson looked at Settino’s cell phone and discovered a message from her to a man he didn’t know. “My Bruce is going to be in Connecticut for three days. I need some playtime,” the message read. He also found messages from the man, including a voicemail in which the man referred to Settino as “cupcake” and said they didn’t see enough of each other. Settino has said the man was just a friend.Johnson ended the engagement. But ownership of the ring remained up in the air.A trial judge initially concluded Settino was entitled to keep the engagement ring, reasoning that Johnson “mistakenly thought Settino was cheating on him”. An appeals court found Johnson should get the ring. In Sept, the case landed before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court , which ultimately ruled that Johnson should keep the ring. In their ruling the justices said the case raised the question of whether the issue of “who is at fault” should continue to govern the rights to engagement rings when the wedding doesn’t happen. More than six decades ago, the court found that an engagement ring is generally understood to be a conditional gift and determined that the person who gives it can get it back after a failed engagement, but only if that person was “without fault”.Harvard Law School professor Rebecca Tushnet, who studies engagement ring law, said she wasn’t surprised that the court rejected the fault standard, saying it really doesn’t fit with modern family law.","The case involved Bruce Johnson and Caroline Settino, who started dating in the summer of 2016.

Republicans secure control of Senate

Trump assembles new administration

Donald Trump has emerged victorious in Arizona, flipping the state back into the Republican column after it was narrowly won by Joe Biden in 2020. This decisive win in the crucial battleground state, which carries 11 electoral votes, has propelled Trump’s Electoral College total to 312, compared to Vice President Kamala Harris' 226. Arizona, historically a key swing state, had been seen as a stronghold for Democrats in recent years.The win in Arizona also marks Trump’s success in all seven battleground states, including Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, all of which he had lost in 2020. This sweeping reversal of fortunes reflects his continued strong appeal among conservative and working-class voters, including a substantial share of Hispanic voters in states like Arizona.In addition to securing the presidency, Republicans have reclaimed control of the Senate, winning 52 seats to the Democrats' 47, with strong performances in key states. The House of Representatives is also expected to remain under Republican control, with CNN reporting GOP victories in 213 seats, close to the 218 needed for a majority. NBC currently projects Republicans at 212 seats, with Democrats holding 204, though senior Democrats still hope for a narrow win to counterbalance Trump's legislative power.Democrats, meanwhile, are internally questioning the decision to replace Biden with Harris at the top of the ticket only 100 days before the election, with some, like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, suggesting an earlier withdrawal by Biden could have opened the field for stronger candidates.With victory secured, Trump is already preparing for his second term. Susie Wiles, his campaign manager, has been named White House Chief of Staff, marking a historic first for a woman in the role. Trump has ruled out appointing Mike Pompeo and Nikki Haley to Cabinet roles, instead favouring new faces like former ambassador to Germany Ric Grenell for secretary of state, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., known for his anti-vaccine stance, is also expected to play a prominent role in health policy, with Elon Musk being considered for a role in government auditing.","Donald Trump has won Arizona, flipping the state back into the Republican column.

Health officials suspect the transmission likely originated from an animal, with British Columbia Health Officer Dr Bonnie Henry stressing the unusual nature of the case.""This is a rare event,"" British Columbia Health Officer Bonnie Henry said in a statement, ""We are conducting a thorough investigation to fully understand the source of exposure here in BC""While avian flu is typically found in wild birds and poultry, recent reports have shown the virus appearing in mammals, with outbreaks impacting various species across North America, including cattle in the United States this year. Although human cases remain infrequent, health experts have raised concerns about bird flu’s potential to mutate and spread among humans, especially as animal cases increase.The risks associated with bird flu are heightened by the virus’s capacity to jump species, which could eventually facilitate human-to-human transmission—a development scientists worry could pose a significant public health risk.In another case, officials in the United States recently reported an avian flu infection in a person from Missouri, notably the first instance where no direct exposure to infected animals was identified. All previous cases in the US, beginning in 2022, involved farmworkers who had direct contact with infected poultry.While there have been occasional human cases of H5 avian flu globally, sustained human-to-human transmission has yet to be observed.Avian influenza has affected approximately 450 dairy establishments across 15 states in the United States since March, while the CDC has documented 46 human infections since April.In British Columbia, Canada, authorities have detected the virus in at least 22 poultry operations since October, with multiple wild birds also testing positive, as per provincial data.","A teenager in British Columbia has tested positive for bird flu, marking Canada’s first confirmed human case of the H5 strain.

US supreme court justice Sonia Sotomayor has no plans to resign from her position, despite some urging President Biden to appoint a successor before the conclusion of his term and the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.“She’s in great health, and the court needs her now more than ever,” said one source, according to a CNN report.Vermont senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) also said on Sunday that Sotomayor shouldn’t resign from her position. “I don’t think it’s sensible,” Sanders said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”Some progressive voices have suggested that justice Sotomayor retire to allow Biden to appoint a new liberal justice before January, when Republicans are expected to take control of the senate. However, Sotomayor has opted not to retire.The confirmation process for a supreme court nominee takes several months, making it nearly impossible to complete before January, even without complications.Born on June 25, 1954, in the Bronx, Sotomayor is the daughter of Juan Sotomayor and Celina Baez, both of whom are from Puerto Rico. The bold federal trial court judge, who prevented a damaging Major League Baseball strike in 1995, made history as the first Hispanic and third woman to serve on the US Supreme Court.Despite openly discussing her experience with type 1 diabetes, Sotomayor remains an active presence on the court. She is known for her rigorous questioning during oral arguments and has been vocal about her concerns regarding the court's increasingly conservative direction.","Sonia Sotomayor has no plans to resign from her position, despite some urging President Biden to appoint a successor before the conclusion of his term and the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.“She’s in great health, and the court needs her now more than ever,” said one source.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115153995,imgsize-1089675,width-400,resizemode-4/115153995.jpg"

Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy on Sunday backed President-elect Donald Trump ’s administration's mass deportation plans, characterising it as a ""pragmatic"" approach and suggesting it aligns with the views of many Americans.Speaking on ABC's ""This Week"" in an interview with Jonathan Karl, Ramaswamy acknowledged that the US has a broken legal immigration system but added that the first step should be to restore the rule of law in a pragmatic way.""Do we have a broken legal immigration system? Yes, we do, but I think the first step is going to be to restore the rule of law and do it in a very pragmatic way,” Ramaswamy said, as quoted by Politico.He stressed that most Americans likely agree that individuals who have entered the country illegally and committed a crime should be deported, describing it as the largest mass deportation.“A pragmatic way. I don’t think most Americans disagree with me to say those who have entered, those who have committed a crime, they should be out of the country. That would be the largest mass deportation,"" he said.While Ramaswamy did not confirm specific figures regarding the number of potential deportations, he stressed that those who entered the country illegally in recent months ""have no place in this country."" He advocated for a ""pragmatic"" approach that prioritises the deportation of individuals who have committed crimes, a move he believes would result in a historically significant mass deportation.Ramaswamy also called for a halt to all federal funding that supports illegal immigration, including aid to sanctuary cities. He believes this would encourage self-deportation. ""Not an iota, not a cent of government spending should go to subsidize this,” he said. ""Not to sanctuary cities, not to federal aid for people in this country illegally, and we’ll see a large number—by the millions—of self-deportations as well.”Although acknowledging Trump's commitment to respecting the dignity of Americans, Ramaswamy did not rule out the possibility of deporting individuals protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. ""I say this as the child of legal immigrants to this country, the proud child of legal immigrants to the United States of America,” he explained. ""If your first act of entering this country broke the law, that doesn’t allow you to remain in this country. You have no right to enter the United States.”When asked about his own political future, including the possibility of serving in the Trump administration or pursuing the open Ohio Senate seat, Ramaswamy remained open to possibilities. ""There are a couple of great options on the table,” he said. “I want to have the biggest possible impact on the country.”","Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy backs President-elect Donald Trump's mass deportation plans.

American YouTuber Johnny Somali , 24, has issued an apology for kissing a statue in Seoul, South Korea, commemorating Korean victims of wartime sexual slavery. The kissing video, posted to his YouTube channel, sparked outrage among viewers.""I want to apologize to Koreans. I didn't understand the significance of the statue,"" Somali said in a video posted Thursday on the Jcompany YouTube channel. He explained that his actions were intended to entertain his American audience. The video shows Somali bowing before the statue at the Changdong History and Culture Park and saying in Korean, ""I'm truly sorry for being disrespectful.""Despite his apology and his expressed interest in learning about the history of Japan's wartime sexual slavery, some viewers remain unconvinced of Somali's sincerity. Their skepticism arises from Somali's failure to remove other controversial content from his social media accounts.This includes a photo on his Instagram account, originally captioned ""I defeated Koreans for you, Shinzo Abe ,"" featuring Somali holding a picture of the former Japanese prime minister. While the YouTube post has been deleted, the Instagram caption was changed to ""RIP Shinzo Abe!"" as of Friday.

"'Mass deportation, purge government, pardon himself': What Trump cards will Donald play on day 1",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mass-deportation-purge-government-pardon-himself-what-trump-cards-will-donald-play-on-day-1/articleshow/115145576.cms,"Pardon himself, rioters



'Settle Russia-Ukraine war in 24 hours'



Roll back protections for transgender students



'Totally obliterate deep state' of govt workers



'Drill, drill, drill'



From pardoning himself in most of criminal cases to reversing climate policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Donald Trump's bucket list of dos and donts on day one of assuming the Oval office is all set to raise the 'temperature' of the United States of America quite literally.His agenda includes initiating mass deportations of migrants, reversing key Biden administration education policies, overhauling the federal government by dismissing thousands of federal employees he believes are undermining him, and granting pardons to individuals arrested for their involvement in the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot.“I want to close the border, and I want to drill, drill, drill,"" he said of his day 1 plans, as quoted by the Associated Press.Within ""two seconds"" of assuming office, President-elect Trump said that he would fire Jack Smith, the special counsel overseeing two federal cases against him. Smith is already considering how to conclude the cases, citing a longstanding Justice Department policy that prevents the prosecution of sitting presidents.Since the Capitol attack nearly four years ago, more than 1,500 people have been charged in connection with the violent siege by Trump supporters. “I am inclined to pardon many of them,"" Trump had said in March, adding, “I can’t say for every single one, because a couple of them, probably they got out of control.”Trump cannot pardon himself for his state conviction in New York related to the hush money case. However, as president-elect, he could attempt to use his position to have his felony conviction overturned or expunged, potentially avoiding a prison sentence. Meanwhile, his case in Georgia, where he faces charges of election interference, is likely to be the only remaining criminal case. It would probably be delayed until at least 2029, after his presidential term ends, especially with the Georgia prosecutor having just won reelection.Trump has repeatedly claimed that he could resolve the war between Russia and Ukraine in just one day. However, Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, dismissed the idea, stating that ""the Ukrainian crisis cannot be solved in one day.""“They’re dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying. And I’ll have that done — I’ll have that done in 24 hours,” Trump had told CNN in May.During his campaign, Trump promised to roll back Biden administration policies aimed at protecting transgender students from discrimination in schools, vowing to take action on his first day in office. Opposition to transgender rights became a central theme of his campaign’s final push, with a campaign ad targeting Vice President Kamala Harris. The ad featured a narrator saying, “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”“Don’t forget, that was done as an order from the president. That came down as an executive order. And we’re going to change it — on Day 1 it’s going to be changed,” Trump had said in May.In April, the Biden administration introduced new Title IX protections, making it clear that treating transgender students differently from their peers constitutes discrimination. In response, Trump pledged to reverse these changes, asserting that he would take action immediately upon taking office, emphasizing his ability to act unilaterally without needing congressional approval.Trump aims to overhaul the federal workforce by stripping tens of thousands of career employees of their civil service protections, making it easier to fire them. His goal is twofold: significantly reduce the size of the federal government, which he has long criticized as an unnecessary drain, and “totally obliterate the deep state” — the network of career officials he believes are undermining his administration.While politically appointed officials change with each administration, career employees are typically seen as nonpartisan experts who help maintain stability and continuity in government. Trump wants to convert some of these career positions into political roles, allowing him to replace them with loyalists. To do this, he plans to revive a 2020 executive order, “Schedule F,” which would strip job protections from roughly 50,000 of the 2.2 million civilian federal employees and create a new class of political appointees.Trump aims to reverse key climate policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. On his first day in office, he plans to use an executive order to roll back environmental protections, halt wind energy projects, dismantle Biden's electric car transition goals, and eliminate corporate sustainability standards.He has also pledged to boost US fossil fuel production, promising to “drill, drill, drill” on Day 1. Additionally, he seeks to open the Arctic wilderness to oil drilling, arguing that it would help lower energy costs.","'I want to close the border, and I want to drill, drill, Drill,"" he said of his day 1 plans, as quoted by the Associated Press.

A serious incident on GT Road near Kalashah Kako saw nine people injured when a van collided with a stationary truck, its driver unable to see the parked vehicle through the dense haze.The smog has also forced Lahore high court to mandate a shutdown of all trade activities by 8 pm and close markets on Sundays, aiming to minimize pollution-inducing activity.In Multan, conditions reached what experts called ""apocalyptic"" levels, with the AQI exceeding 2,000 on Friday morning. The concentration of PM2.5—a hazardous particulate matter known to cause severe respiratory and cardiovascular issues—was recorded at 947 micrograms per cubic meter, nearly 190 times above World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The WHO deems PM2.5 levels above five micrograms per cubic meter harmful.In response, the state government is on high alert, implementing emergency measures to curb pollution levels. Public parks and museums across major cities have been closed until at least November 17.Authorities have also faced criticism for failing to enforce preemptive anti-smog directives, with citizens often seen without masks despite the severe air quality.Multan, the largest city in southern Punjab, recorded an extremely dangerous Air Quality Index (AQI) of 2,135 between 8am and 9am on Friday, according to data from IQAir, as reported by Dawn.

At least 26 people — 14 soldiers, six railway employees and six civilian passengers — were killed and more than 60 injured in a suicide bombing at a railway station in Pakistan’s southwestern city of Quetta on Saturday. The proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), the most prominent militant group in the restive province, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying its suicide unit, the Majeed Brigade, had carried out the bombing to target a “Pakistani army unit” returning via train after completing a course at an infantry school.Authorities said the blast was a “suicide attack” primarily on law enforcement agencies, while civilians were also targeted. Forty-six among the injured were Pakistan army soldiers, police said. The explosion occurred as a popular morning train, Jaffar Express, was about to leave a station in Quetta for Peshawar in the northwest.Pakistan Railways had restored train services between Quetta and Peshawar last month after a suspension of seven weeks because separatist militants in Balochistan had blown up a key railway bridge in Aug.Social media videos captured Saturday’s explosion. The bomb went off when hundreds of people were at the platform. A video of the aftermath showed injured individuals and debris strewn throughout the station. The steel structure of the platform’s roof had been ripped apart.“The target was army personnel from the Infantry School,” said Muazzam Jah Ansari, police chief of Balochistan province.Wasim Baig, spokesperson for the provincial health department, said the death toll rose to 26 after two people succumbed to their injuries in hospital while 62 others were injured.The BLA has long waged an armed rebellion, driven by demands for independence and control over the province’s gas and mineral resources.Balochistan CM Sarfraz Bugti called the act deplorable and the perpetrators “worse than animals”. He said the authorities would pursue them and “bring them to their logical end”.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif denounced the bombing, saying those who orchestrated the attack “will pay a very heavy price for it”, adding that security forces were determined to eliminate “the menace of terrorism”.A decades-old insurgency has destabilised Balochistan and created security concerns for China-led projects trying to access the province’s untapped resources. In Aug at least 73 people were killed in Balochistan province after separatist militants attacked police stations, railway lines and highways.Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest province and the richest in terms of natural resources, but it is the least developed. The region shares a volatile border with Iran and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, and also boasts a vast coastline along the Arabian Sea.The govt’s military operation to suppress the separatist movement in the province has resulted in widespread human rights abuses against Baloch dissenters, including disappearances, torture and extrajudicial killings.","14 soldiers, six railway employees and six civilian passengers killed.

KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA: Front Line Defenders have condemned the arrest of human rights defender Idris Khattak, demanding his immediate release due to safety issues and deteriorating health .According to Front Line Defenders, Idris Khattak was abducted on November 13, 2019, and was later tried by the military court under the Official Secrets Act . In December 2021, he was sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment.In the 5 years of imprisonment, the human rights defender has gone through unsanitary and unsafe conditions in the jail.In a post on X, the Front Line Defenders stated, ""We urge Pakistani authorities to immediately end the persecution and incarceration of HRD Idris Khattak , especially given his age and underlying health concerns. Following his enforced disappearance , and 5 years of unjust imprisonment for his human rights work campaigning for religious and ethnic minorities , we call for his immediate and safe release to his family.""Idris Khattak is a prominent human rights advocate in Pakistan. His activism has focused on defending the rights of religious and ethnic minorities, often in the face of systematic state repression. Khattak has been particularly vocal about abuses carried out by military and intelligence agencies, especially in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region, which has experienced ongoing conflict and instability.United Nations human rights experts also lamented the conviction and said, ""Mr. Khattak's reported sentencing is an attack against the human rights community in Pakistan and sends a chilling message to civil society activists monitoring and reporting on alleged violations, committed by the military and security forces or with their consent or acquiescence, such as systematic or widespread enforced disappearances.""Pakistan is known for violating human rights by forcibly disappearing the activists and defenders. The people who are abducted by the Pakistan military forces are not given medical assistance and are not allowed to meet their families.","Idris Khattak is a prominent human rights advocate in Pakistan.
