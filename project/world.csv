NEW DELHI: A 31-member committee formed in the Haryana IPS officer Y Puran Kumar's alleged suicide case suicide, on Sunday, gave the Chandigarh administration and Haryana government 48 hours to remove state police chief Shatrujeet Kapur.Kapur is among the officers named by Kumar’s wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, for allegedly abetting her husband’s suicide.The committee made this demand during a mahapanchayat in Chandigarh on Sunday. Heavy police were deployed around the venue.“The Haryana DGP and former Rohtak SP should be arrested. The DGP must be removed from his post. We have given 48 hours, after which we will decide the next course of action,” a committee spokesperson told reporters, as quoted by news agency PTI.Six days have passed since Kumar, who was last posted as IG at the Police Training Centre in Rohtak’s Sunaria, died. His post-mortem and cremation have not been conducted, as the family is refusing consent until their demands are met.The mahapanchayat saw tension when former Haryana MP Raj Kumar Saini reportedly made a controversial remark, sparking anger among attendees. Calm was restored after organisers intervened.A message from Kumar’s family was read, appealing for support in their pursuit of justice. Committee members also demanded a judicial probe into the case, said Gurmail Singh, a committee member. “The family and dalit community fear that if the last rites are conducted, the government may not take action against the accused,” said Karamvir, a committee member. He also questioned the work done by the Special Investigation Team set up by Chandigarh police.Fifty-two-year-old Kumar, a 2001-batch IPS officer, allegedly shot himself at his Chandigarh home on October 7. In an eight-page note reportedly left behind, he named eight senior officers, including DGP Kapur and former Rohtak SP Narendra Bijarniya, accusing them of harassment and tarnishing his image. The note also mentioned caste-based discrimination.The Haryana government has transferred Bijarniya, replacing him with IPS officer Surinder Singh Bhoria.In her complaint to Chandigarh Police, Amneet P Kumar sought an FIR against Kapur and Bijarniya under Section 108 (abetment of suicide) and relevant provisions of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, demanding their arrest. She also requested amendments to the FIR to include all accused officers’ names.Haryana ministers and senior officials, including chief secretary Anurag Rastogi, recently met the family to persuade them to agree to the post-mortem and cremation.","Y Puran Kumar, a 2001-batch IPS officer, allegedly shot himself at his Chandigarh home on October 7.

Asian markets tumbled on Monday after US President Donald Trump escalated tensions with China, threatening last week to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese goods.Hong Kong's HSI traded at 25,374, down 916 points or 3.49%. Shanghai and Shenzhen also dipped 1.3% and 2.56% respectively.Japan's Nikkei also traded in red, reaching 48,088, shedding 491 points or 1.01%. Kospi, too followed the downward trajectoy, falling 1.66 points to 3,550 at 10:30 AM IST.Trump had posted on social media on Friday that he would levy an additional 100% tariff on China and warned he might cancel a summit with Xi. He cited Beijing’s export restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are used in smartphones, electric vehicles, and military hardware.The new US tariffs, along with export controls on ""any and all critical software,"" are set to take effect from November 1. Trump described Beijing’s actions as ""extraordinarily aggressive"" and said, ""There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World 'captive'.""Currently, Chinese goods face 30% US tariffs, while Beijing’s retaliatory duties stand at 10%.The announcement sent Wall Street into a tailspin, with the Nasdaq dropping more than three percent.Investors were already cautious after a recent surge in tech stocks had raised fears of a market bubble.The latest tensions came after months of fragile peace between the two economic giants, who had been negotiating a full trade deal following Trump’s tariff announcements in April. That earlier round had led to escalating tit-for-tat levies.Meanwhile, Trump’s Sunday comments gave a small boost to US futures, which rose more than one percent.Gold, often seen as a safe-haven during uncertainty, continued to climb, hitting a new record of $4,060. Oil also bounced back after Friday’s slump, which had been worsened by Trump’s remarks and eased by news of the Israel-Hamas peace deal calming supply concerns.","Hong Kong's HSI traded at 25,374, down 916 points or 3.49%.

Pakistan thought it could do anything with nuclear capability, but Operation Sindoor proved it wrong. The new normal’s impact was visible on Pakistan — we outperformed it in every field, including sports,” General Chauhan said while addressing students at the 128th Foundation Day celebrations of Scindia School in Gwalior.He emphasised that a war is not fought by armed forces alone but by the entire nation, with political leaders, diplomats and soldiers all playing critical roles.“Operation Sindoor created a new matrix of decision and timing in warfare. Many challenges still lie ahead for the armed forces. No war is fought by the armed forces alone; the whole nation fights it. Leaders, diplomats and soldiers know their roles,” he said, as quoted by PTI.General Chauhan explained that Operation Sindoor, which involved precision air strikes on terror hubs in Pakistan and PoK, established a “new normal” — that “talks and terrorism cannot go hand in hand.”He underlined the broader responsibility of citizens, saying nation-building is a collective effort. “The future belongs to India. The coming era belongs to India, and we, the 140 crore people of this country, can achieve this together,” he said, urging the youth to actively contribute during “Amrit Kaal.”Union minister and BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, foreign secretary Vikram Misri, alumni and parents of students attended the event held at the Gwalior Fort, reported PTI.","“The country cannot tolerate even the threat of a nuclear attack.

SC: Karur case has shaken nat'l conscience, deserves fair probe

NEW DELHI: Noting that the Karur stampede in Tamil Nadu shook ""national conscience"" and the case has ""political undertone"", Supreme Court Monday decided to hand over the probe into the tragedy to CBI & also appointed a three-member panel headed by its former judge Ajay Rastogi to supervise the investigation.Questioning the fairness of the investigation, a bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and N V Anjaria noted that top state police officials had made a statement that their subordinates were not at fault and said, ""Prima facie, this fact in itself creates a doubt in the minds of the public about the independence and impartiality of the investigation.""The families of those who died and got injured are in the doldrums and what they want is a free and fair probe, with the political tussle over the stampede being of little solace to them.The incident of Karur stampede has definitely left an imprint in the minds of the citizens throughout the country, wherein 41 persons died in a stampede and more than 100 were injured; it has wide ramifications in respect of the life of the citizens and in this context enforcing the fundamental rights of the families who lost their kith and kin is of utmost importance.Therefore, looking to the political undertone of the case and the fact that without having regard to the gravity of the incident, the comments which have been made before the media by the top officers of the police department may create doubt in the minds of the citizenry on impartiality and fair investigation.The faith and trust of the general public on the process of investigation must be restored in the criminal justice system, and one way to instill such trust is by ensuring that the investigation in the present case is completely impartial, independent and unbiased,"" the bench said.""Looking to the fact that the issue involved certainly has a bearing on the fundamental rights of the citizens and the incident which has shaken the national conscience deserves fair and impartial investigation. As such, by way of interim measure, direction deserves to be issued to hand over the investigation to the CBI, which would lead to fair administration of justice. There cannot be any doubt that fair investigation is the right of a citizen,"" it said.Immediately after the court passed the order, the state govt brought to its notice the fact that families of two victims, whose name was used to petition for CBI probe, had denied any role in filing the petitions. Senior advocates A M Singhvi and P Wilson, appearing for the state, said that fraud was being played on the court. Taking note of their submission, the bench said it would take cognizance of the issue but added that the controversy would not have a bearing on its order as other petitioners too had sought a CBI probe. One of the petitioners is the TVK party. Though it did not seek a CBI probe, the party had requested the court to direct that the ongoing probe be supervised by a retired SC judge.The bench also sought an explanation from the Madras high court on the manner in which a single-judge bench of the court had taken suo motu cognizance of the case and ordered SIT probe when a similar matter was pending before the Madurai bench of HC.""..it is clear that the division bench at Madurai denied the CBI investigation, holding that the investigation by the local police is not flawed, while the learned single judge at the Main Seat (Chennai), dissatisfied with the police investigation, directed for constitution of SIT. Such recourse prima facie indicates the lack of sensitivity and propriety to deal with such a matter, creating multiplicity of proceedings, for reasons best known to the Hon'ble Judges,"" the bench said.""But by taking suo motu cognizance even during pendency of writ petitions before the Madurai bench within whose jurisdiction the incident took place and also ignoring that the Hon'ble Chief Minister of the State has already constituted an Enquiry Commission comprising a retired Judge of the High Court, how far the order of the learned Single Judge was correct in taking suo motu cognizance and creating a SIT, is an issue. ""The court directed the CBI to forthwith appoint a senior officer for taking over the investigation and ordered the state police to immediately hand over the FIR and other relevant papers, evidence - digital or otherwise - collected till now to the CBI for further investigation.",Justices J K Maheshwari and N V Anjaria noted that top state police officials had made a statement that their subordinates were not at fault.

NEW DELHI: A woman from Manipur was found dead, and her alleged live-in partner was critically injured in South Delhi's Munirka on Sunday in what police suspect to be a case of murder followed by an attempted suicide.The deceased was identified as Thempi Khongsai, a beautician by profession. Her partner, Thangjam Viney Meitei, is undergoing treatment at AIIMS Trauma Centre. Both were originally from Manipur and were living together in a rented flat in Munirka for the past three years.

Taliban's Diplomatic Signal From Darul Uloom Deoband: Muttaqi Says India-Afghan Ties Look ‘Bright’

What is Darul Uloom Deoband?



The Afghan connection: How Deobandi Islam reached Afghanistan



NEW DELHI: Taliban ’s foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi visited the Darul Uloom Deoband in Saharanpur on Saturday, meeting Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind President Maulana Arshad Madani and other senior officials of the seminary.Muttaqi expressed gratitude for the warm reception and optimism about India-Afghanistan ties. “I am thankful to all of you for the warm welcome given to me by everyone in Deoband and the love showered upon me. I will pray to God that India-Afghanistan relations improve further,” he said, as quoted by news agency ANI.The Afghan leader highlighted the significance of educational and cultural ties, noting that no political discussions took place but that historical connections were celebrated.As per news agency ANI, Maulana Arshad Madani emphasised the historical role of Afghanistan in India’s independence struggle and reassured that Afghanistan would not allow terrorists to use its soil against India.This visit is part of a week-long trip to India by Muttaqi, marking the first high-level delegation from Kabul since the Taliban took power in 2021.Darul Uloom Deoband, established in 1866 in present-day Uttar Pradesh, is one of South Asia’s most influential Islamic seminaries.It was founded by scholars including Maulana Muhammad Qasim Nanautawi and Maulana Rashid Muhammad Gangohi to educate Muslim youth in a rigorous, orthodox understanding of Islam, known as Deobandi Islam.The seminary was originally part of an anti-colonial movement aimed at revitalising Islam and resisting British rule in India. Over the decades, Deobandi schools spread throughout India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other parts of South Asia.While Darul Uloom Deoband is in India, its teachings spread across the border into Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pashtun communities were instrumental in establishing Deobandi seminaries along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, according to The Conversation.The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 accelerated this process as Deobandi madrassas, supported by Pakistani authorities and funding from Saudi Arabia and the CIA, educated Afghan refugee youth who would join the anti-Soviet resistance.Many of these students later became key figures in the Taliban. The movement’s founder, Mullah Mohammad Omar, and other Taliban leaders were educated in Deobandi-inspired seminaries in Pakistan, adopting a version of the ideology that included ultraconservative Wahhabi influences, as per NPR.While the Taliban identify as Deobandis, scholars at the original Indian seminary emphasise that their interpretation diverged from classical Deobandi teachings.“The Taliban say they are doing what we did in India. The way we kicked the British out of India, that’s what the Taliban are doing in Afghanistan,” said Maulana Arshad Madani back in 2021 when the Taliban took control over Afghanistan, clarifying that there is no organisational link between the seminary and the Taliban, as per NPR.This visit of Taliban’s foreign minister comes amid efforts to improve India-Afghanistan relations, as Muttaqi emphasised hopes for increased exchanges and cooperation, including in regional projects like the Chabahar port in Iran.The visit reinforces the soft-power and cultural dimension of diplomacy between the two countries while acknowledging the centuries-old educational and religious links that connect them.",Amir Khan Muttaqi visited the Darul Uloom Deoband in Saharanpur on Saturday.

Rapid health decline and fatal complications following cosmetic procedure



Legal battle and allegations raise concerns over cosmetic procedure oversight







Brazilian social media influencer Adair Mendes Dutra Junior, widely known as Junior Dutra, has died at the age of 31 following severe, unexpected complications from a cosmetic procedure. Known for his vibrant social media presence, creative lifestyle content, and engaging personality, Junior had gained a large, loyal following on Instagram. His untimely death has sent shockwaves through the Brazilian beauty community, social media circles, and among his over 100,000 devoted followers, many of whom expressed grief, disbelief, and heartbreak across multiple platforms.The tragedy unfolded after he underwent a popular cosmetic procedure called the “fox eyes” surgery, which aims to lift, reshape, and elongate the outer corners of the eyes for a more striking, model-like appearance. What was intended as a simple beauty enhancement turned fatal, tragically highlighting the potential risks, hidden dangers, and lack of regulation surrounding trendy cosmetic procedures increasingly sought after by influencers worldwide.Junior Dutra reportedly underwent the fox eyes procedure in March, performed by celebrity dentist Fernando Simionato Garbi. The influencer had publicly shared videos documenting the procedure, later revealing significant swelling, bruising, and redness around his eyes.Following the treatment, Junior developed a serious infection, which persisted despite dermatological care. In an interview with Brazilian outlet Feed TV, just a month before his death, he shared his deteriorating health: “I didn’t expect it to get this bad.” He described frequent hospital visits as he struggled to recover from post-procedure complications.This situation underscores a critical point: even procedures that appear minimally invasive or cosmetic can carry severe health risks if complications arise.The fox eyes or cat eyes surgery has surged in popularity in recent years, inspired by celebrities like Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner. The procedure is designed to create an almond-shaped, lifted eye by raising the outer corners, giving a youthful and striking appearance.According to the American Board of Cosmetic Surgery (ABCS), several methods can achieve this look, including:Despite their popularity, these treatments are not risk-free. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) warns that complications can include:The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also cautioned against the use of PDO threads for eyebrow or eyelid lifts, noting potential for permanent disfigurement, severe swelling, and long-lasting pain.Medical experts emphasise the importance of monitoring for early warning signs of complications. Post-procedure symptoms that should not be ignored include:To minimise risks, specialists recommend:Junior Dutra’s health reportedly worsened rapidly in his final days. His close friend Gean Souza told Brazilian magazine Quem that he began experiencing shortness of breath and extreme weakness. As reported by The US Sun, on October 3, Junior was rushed to a public hospital in São Paulo after severe respiratory distress. Despite emergency care, he could not be saved. His sudden passing left fans and the online beauty community in shock, illustrating how quickly post-procedure complications can escalate.Adding further complexity to the tragedy, Junior had filed a police complaint prior to his death. Legal documents obtained by Brazilian outlet Portland Leo Dias reveal that Junior accused Garbi of performing medical procedures outside his professional license and impersonating a doctor. The complaint included charges of illegal medical practice, fraud, and causing serious bodily harm. Junior had also requested an official investigation by the 15th Police District of São Paulo.Garbi, through legal representatives, denied any wrongdoing and maintained that his procedures were performed legally and safely under proper supervision. The case highlights the need for stronger regulatory oversight in cosmetic procedures, particularly those fueled by social media trends.","Brazilian social media influencer Adair Mendes Dutra Junior, widely known as Junior Dutra, has died at the age of 31 following severe, unexpected complications from a cosmetic procedure.

CHANDIGARH: Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur, in the eye of a storm following the suicide of IPS officer Y Puran Kumar, was on Monday sent on leave.Rajiv Jaitly, media adviser to Haryana CM Nayab Singh Saini, confirmed the development but the official order was yet to be released till the filing of this report.The decision came past midnight —a few hours after a mega celebration in Sonipat on Friday to mark a year of the Saini govt was put on hold in view of the deepening tensions over Puran Kumar’s death. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to address the ‘Jan Vishwas-Jan Vikas’ rally.Pressure was mounting on govt to take action against Kapur, as Puran Kumar’s wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, had refused to allow autopsy or cremation until the DGP was removed. The stalemate dragged on for nearly a week.Dalit groups were piling on the pressure and a ‘mahapanchayat’ set up for justice to the family had handed an ultimatum of 48 hours, which expires on Tuesday.The top brass of Haryana govt, including chief principal secretary to CM Rajesh Khullar, held meetings with the family but the deadlock persisted. IPS officer Narendra Bijarniya, who too was named in Puran Kumar’s suicide was removed as Rohtak SP but Amneet stuck to her demand for action against the Haryana DGP.After a series of meetings on Monday that stretched till midnight, it was decided to send Kapur on leave.The aftershocks were felt on another front — govt’s plan to celebrate the first anniversary of the Saini govt.Protests by Dalit groups and growing support of opposition parties for the grieving family were casting long shadows on the event.According to sources, the decision to postpone it was taken after CM Nayab Singh Saini and chief secretary Anurag Rastogi chaired a meeting to review arrangements at the Sonipat venue.After a series of meetings on Monday that stretched till midnight, it was decided to send Kapur on leave. The aftershocks were felt on another front — govt’s plan to celebrate the first anniversary of the Saini govt.Protests by Dalit groups and growing support of opposition parties for the grieving family were casting long shadows on the event.According to sources, the decision to postpone it was taken after CM Nayab Singh Saini and chief secretary Anurag Rastogi chaired a meeting to review arrangements at the Sonipat venue.After the meeting, the CM set off for New Delhi by road where he would have stayed for the night and met dignitaries the next day. He was also due to attend a programme in Nuh on Tuesday.Chandigarh Police, continuing their investigation, have served a notice to IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, widow of the deceased, asking her to submit her late husband’s laptop to the Special Investigation Team (SIT).The laptop is reportedly where Kumar had drafted his suicide note, which remains saved in the device’s drafts.Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi is due to visit the family on Tuesday. So will Union minister from Bihar, Chirag Paswan.Politicians from across the country are making a beeline to visit the Kumar household in Chandigarh to console the grieving family.Union minister of state for social justice and empowerment Ramdas Athawale and Telangana deputy CM Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka met the deceased officer’s wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar, in the morning.After meeting the family, Athawale said he has assured them of all support and that the entire country’s SC community is awaiting action against the officers responsible for Kumar’s suicide. Later, Athawale also met Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini and discussed the case. Both Athawale and Paswan are allies of ruling BJP.The Telangana deputy CM criticised Haryana govt for ‘inaction’ in the case. Puran Kumar was a native of Telangana.“In his dying declaration, the deceased named Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur and SP Narendra Bijarnia, accusing them of humiliation and harassment leading to his suicide. As per law, a suicide note is treated as a dying declaration, warranting strict action. However, Haryana authorities have failed to act, which is both pathetic and inhuman. I demand that Haryana and Centre take immediate action against both officers,” Vikramarka said.K Raju, AICC in charge of Jharkhand Congress, alleged that authorities are not complying with the constitutional provision that provides for equality before law. “Action against senior officers responsible for driving the IPS officer to suicide is not being taken as they are high ranking officers. Delay in action is lowering the morale of the educated Dalit youth of the country,” he said.Punjab ministers Harbhajan Singh, Harpal Singh Cheema, Mohinder Bhagat and Dr Ravjot Singh visited the family, along with former Lok Sabha MP Prem Singh Chandumajra. Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) president Abhay Chautala also consoled the family.The Sarva Khap Maha Panchayat has also announced support to the deceased IPS officer’s family. Pawanjeet Bhanwala, spokesperson for Sarv Jatiya Sarv Khap Mahapanchayat and Jat Mahasabha, said that a meeting of Sarv Khap will be held on Tuesday at Narwana in Jind district.","Haryana DGP Shatrujeet Kapur, in the eye of a storm following the suicide of IPS officer Y Puran Kumar, was on Monday sent on leave.

Police swung into action after a video of the students was widely circulated on the internet. “The FIR was lodged based on a complaint filed by a sub-inspector,” said SHO Medical Sheelesh Yadav.However, on Sunday, a sub-inspector took a BTech student, Sumit Kumar, into police custody from the hostel premises. “The detention was unlawful. Police can’t detain any students from the hostel premises without the consent of the chief proctor, but they did. As soon as a photo of the entry-exit register page came to light on social media, the cops fined the student for breach of peace and granted him bail from the police station,” student leader Vineet Chaprana told TOI.He added, “We sought a response from the chief warden Dinesh Kumar about how a police officer could barge into the hostel and detain a student unlawfully. He replied that he wasn’t aware of it.”After the video came to light, the CCSU administration suspended eight students for one month and terminated five students.Their security deposits of Rs 2,000 have been seized by the CCSU administration.Akshay Baisla, another student leader, added, “In the video, a few students were creating a menace while others were just hooting. Still, the wardens are threatening other students as well. What were the security guards doing? Why didn’t they prevent these students from bursting firecrackers in the hostel? CCSU is just trying to hide their incompetence in governing the students by threatening those who have nothing to do with this incident. ”",An FIR has been lodged at the Medical Police Station in Meerut against a few unidentified students of Chaudhary Charan Singh University.

Shehbaz described Trump as “the man the world needed most at this point in time” and said the world would remember him as someone who “stopped seven, now eight, wars.”He added, “Suffice to say, had it not been for this gentleman, who knows, India and Pakistan are both nuclear powers, had he not intervened with his wonderful team during those four days, the war could’ve escalated to a level and who would’ve lived to tell what happened. Similarly, here in this part of the world in the Middle East, Mr president, your valuable contribution along with President Sisi, I think history will remember in golden words. ”Retaking the podium, Trump quipped, “Wow!

Former US President Joe Biden on Monday (local time) said the path to a peace deal in Gaza was “not easy” and praised his successor, Donald Trump , for achieving a successful and “renewed” ceasefire agreement.“The road to this deal was not easy. My administration worked relentlessly to bring hostages home, provide relief to Palestinian civilians, and end the war. I commend President Trump and his team for getting a renewed ceasefire over the finish line,” Biden wrote on X.The Gaza war erupted following Hamas attacks in Israel in October 2023, during Biden’s presidency.He added, “Now, with the backing of the United States and the world, the Middle East is on a path to peace that I hope endures, offering a future for Israelis and Palestinians alike marked by equal measures of peace, dignity, and safety.”The Democrat also expressed relief after Hamas, under Trump’s peace plan, released the last 20 remaining Israeli hostages from the Palestinian enclave.“I am deeply grateful and relieved that this day has come — for the last 20 hostages who have endured unimaginable suffering and are finally reunited with their families and loved ones, and for the civilians in Gaza who have faced immense loss and will finally have the chance to rebuild their lives,” Biden said.On Monday, Trump, who was also Biden’s predecessor in the White House, made a trip to Israel and Egypt to finalise the agreement. In Israel, he addressed the Knesset (parliament) while the two sides carried out a swap of hostages and prisoners. In Egypt, he signed the historic peace pact alongside several world leaders.The summit took place in Sharm el-Sheikh, just three days after a ceasefire went into effect and Israeli forces withdrew to a pre-determined line.","Former US President Joe Biden said the path to a peace deal in Gaza was ‘not easy’ He praised his successor, Donald Trump, for achieving a successful and ‘renewed’ ceasefire agreement.

Venezuela on Monday announced the closure of its Norwegian embassy in Oslo, just days after Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, a vocal critic of President Nicolas Maduro, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.The Venezuelan government, which has not commented on Machado’s win, described the move as part of a “restructuring” of its foreign service.As part of the changes, Caracas also closed its embassy in Australia while opening diplomatic missions in Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso, which it considers “strategic partners in the fight” against “hegemonic pressures,” according to an official statement.Norway’s foreign ministry expressed disappointment over the embassy closure.“It is regrettable. Despite our differences on several issues, Norway wishes to keep the dialogue open with Venezuela and will continue to work in this direction. The Nobel Prize is independent of the Norwegian government,” spokeswoman Cecilie Roang told AFP.The Nobel Peace Prize committee, which awarded Machado, is based in Oslo and is appointed by the Norwegian parliament.Machado, 58, who has been living in hiding in Venezuela, was barred from running in the 2024 presidential election, which Maduro won amid opposition protests.Several countries, including the United States, do not recognize Maduro’s government.On Sunday, without mentioning Machado’s Nobel win, Maduro referred to her as a “witch,” a term frequently used by his administration.Machado was honoured “for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,” said Jorgen Watne Frydnes, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.She dedicated her award to the “suffering people of Venezuela” and to US President Donald Trump , praising his “decisive support of our cause.”",Venezuela announces closure of its Norwegian embassy in Oslo.

As the middle peace deal is holding up for the fourth day, Hamas is set to release all the surviving hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.This comes as US President Donald Trump is making a flash visit to the region for the peace summit and to celebrate his role in brokering last week's ceasefire and hostage release deal.As per Trump's deal, Israel will begin releasing around 2,000 Gaza detainees after Hamas have handed over surviving 20 hostages. According to a spokesperson for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, Israel expects all 20 living hostages to be released to the Red Cross ""early Monday morning.""Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump brushed off concerns about whether the ceasefire would endure.""I think it's going to hold. I think people are tired of it. It's been centuries,"" Trump said.""The war is over. Okay? You understand that?"" he added.In his four hour visit to Israel, Trump is due to meet the families of the hostages seized by Hamas in the deadly cross-border attack two years ago that sparked the war. He will also deliver an address at the Knesset.Prior to his speech, Trump will meet with Netanyahu in the premier’s Knesset office. The two leaders will then meet with families of hostages in the Knesset’s Chagall HallThe timeline is limited by the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, which begins on Monday evening, and marks the second anniversary, on the Hebrew calendar, of the Hamas invasion and massacre that launched the war on October 7, 2023.After visiting Israel, Trump will head to Egypt where he and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will co-host a summit of more than 20 world leaders to back his plan to end the Gaza war and promote Middle East peace.Trump will be looking to resolve some of the huge uncertainty around the next phases of the peace plan -- including Hamas's refusal to disarm and Israel's failure to pledge a full withdrawal from the devastated territory.Trump insisted he had ""guarantees"" from both sides and other key regional players about the initial phase of the deal, and the future stages.""I don't think they're going to want to disappoint me,"" he said.Trump also said he would be ""proud"" to visit Gaza itself, but did not say when such a difficult security challenge would be possible.A new governing body for devastated Gaza -- which Trump himself would head under his own plan -- would be established ""very quickly,"" he added.Under the plan, as Israel conducts a partial withdrawal from Gaza, it will be replaced by a multi-national force coordinated by a US-led command centre in Israel.","Hamas is set to release all the surviving hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.

About the yacht photo



'Katy is very interested in him'







Canada's former prime minister Justin Trudeau faced vicious trolling after Daily Mail published a zoomed-in photo of a shirtless Trudeau kissing Katy Perry on board Katy Perry's 24-metre yacht, the Caravelle, off the coast of Santa Barbara, California. Social media users questioned whether Trudeau has left Canada like he left his family and spends most of the time in the US now, as he has been said to be dating Katy Perry for months now.""What kind of guy @JustinTrudeau is? He is not sincere to his wife and kids even. Leave the country which he left in tatters. Shameless,"" one wrote.""Justin Trudeau and Katy Perry. One pretended to be an astronaut. One pretended to be a Prime Minister,"" another wrote, taking a swipe at Katy Perry's space tour on Blue Origin.""To all of you who voted the liberals in, how ya feeling now? He doesn’t give a sh** about Canada,"" one commented about Trudeau.Trudeau stepped down earlier this year and has been far from politics since then. In 2023, Trudeau split with his wife Sophie ending their 18 years of marriage. They have two sons , Xavier, 18, and Hadrien, 11, and a daughter, Ella-Grace, 16.Trudeau, 53, and Katy Perry, 40, were earlier spotted together in Montreal in July when they were having an intimate dinner at Le Violon restaurant.Katie Perry has a five-year-old daughter, Daisy Dove Bloom, with Pirates of the Caribbean star Orlando Bloom. She was married to comedian Russell Brand from 2010 until 2012.Daily Mail reported that the photos they exclusively published were taken by a passenger on a passing tourist boat in September when Katy Perry was enjoying a brief break from her Lifetimes world tour. The witness said: ""She pulled up her boat next to a small public whale-watching boat, then they started making out. I didn't realise who she was with until I saw the tattoo on the guy's arm and I immediately realised it was Justin Trudeau""Trudeau has a 'Haida raven' tattoo on his upper left arm. The distinctive tattoo is a tribute to an indigenous Canadian people famed for their seamanship and artistry.Neither Katy Perry nor Justin Trudeau commented openly on their relationship after their much-discussed restaurant photo. However, people in their close circle apparently suggested that their relationship at that time was in the very early stages of exploring romance. ""Katy is very, very interested in him. She says he's a real catch, a high-quality guy. She clearly likes him a lot. He likes her a lot,"" a source told the Daily Mail.","Daily Mail published a zoomed-in photo of a shirtless Trudeau kissing Katy Perry on board Katy Perry's 24-metre yacht, the Caravelle, off the coast of Santa Barbara, California.

SHARM AL SHEIKH: Egyptian president told a summit of world leaders on Monday that US President Trump’s Mideast proposal represents the “last chance” for peace in the region and reiterated his call for a two-state solution, saying Palestinians have the right to an independent state.The summit in Egypt’s Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh was aimed at supporting the ceasefire reached in Gaza, ending the Israel-Hamas war and developing a long-term vision for governing and rebuilding the devastated Palestinian territory.Trump’s plan holds out the possibility of a Palestinian state, but only after a lengthy transition period in Gaza and a reform process by the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu opposes Palestinian independence.In his speech, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah El-Sissi also also awarded Trump the Order of the Nile, the country’s highest civilian honor.

President Donald Trump, in a speech to Israel’s parliament, spotlighted mega-donor Miriam Adelson’s outsized influence on US policy toward Israel, recalling her frequent White House visits with her late husband, casino mogul Sheldon Adelson.Sheldon Adelson, who died in 2021, assembled the world's largest casino empire as head of Las Vegas Sands Corp (LVS.N), opens new tab and put much of his fortune into nurturing conservative politicians and policies in the United States and Israel, Reuters reported.Both Adelsons have been known for their philanthropy and business ventures in Israel and donations to Jewish causes. “She loves Israel,” Trump told the Knesset on Monday, crediting the couple with shaping decisions like his 2017 recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, his 2018 move of the US embassy to the holy city, and his 2019 endorsement of Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights.Gesturing to Adelson, an Israeli-born physician and a major donor to his presidential campaigns, Trump said, “Stand up, Miriam,” before recounting how the Adelsons would regularly call and visit him in the Oval Office.He joked that her husband was so persistent he’d “come in through the window,” underscoring the couple’s extraordinary access and impact on his administration. With a grin, Trump said, “She’s got $60 billion in the bank,” then added, “I think she is saying, ‘No, more,’” drawing laughter.He praised her as a wonderful woman whose devotion was so deep, she once refused to say which she loved more – Israel or the United States.Miriam Adelson assumed majority control of Las Vegas Sands in 2021 following the death of her husband, casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson. The company operates major casinos in Singapore and Macau, Al Jazeera reported.Adelson had controlled a larger share of the casino company’s stock when she married Sheldon in 1991, who had built Las Vegas Sands into a gambling empire with resorts across Asia and the US.After Sheldon’s death, Miriam took over the majority stake in the business. In 2022, the family sold their iconic Las Vegas Strip properties, including the Venetian resort, for $6.25bn. The following year, in 2023, Miriam Adelson also acquired majority ownership of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team.Born in Tel Aviv in 1945 after her parents immigrated from Poland, Adelson trained as a physician specialising in addiction treatment. Sheldon Adelson was one of the top Republican Party donors, giving millions to pro-Israel candidates.","Miriam Adelson is the wife of casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who died in 2021.

Candace mocked how Erika was doing photoshoots hours after Charlie Kirk's death while Candace was raising crucial questions.Erika issued a statement without mentioning Candace but replied to the criticism, as she said she is grieving in her own way and there is no linear blueprint for grief.""…there is no linear blueprint for grief. One day you’re collapsed on the floor crying out the name Jesus in between labored breaths. The next you’re playing with your children in the living room, surrounded by family photos, and feeling a rush of something you can only attempt to define as divinely planted and bittersweet joy as a smile breaks through on your face,"" Erika wrote.""They say time heals. But love doesn’t ask to be healed. Love asks to be remembered. It’s humbling to realize that this magnitude of suffering didn’t steal my love for my husband.It amplified it. It crystallized it,"" Erika wrote.""I carry my Charlie in every breath, in every ache, and in every quiet act of day to day living as I attempt to relearn what that rhythm will be.""Candace has been spinning conspiracy theories at length with little or no evidence. Now she claimed an Egyptian Air Force plane left Utah's Provo just before the assassination. She originally claimed the plane flew out of Utah after Charlie Kirk was shot dead, but then corrected herself.Candace claimed the decision to murder Charlie Kirk was made around July 18.Candace claimed Charlie Kirk was under Israel's pressure and lost a Jewish donor before he was shot dead. He spoke of even leaving the pro-Israel cause on a group chat. Candace said Charlie was not killed by a rifle from a rooftop but by a gun from a short distance.","Conservative activist Candace Owens attacked Charlie's wife Erika for not raising the questions Candace is raising.

US President Donald Trump praised his daughter, Ivanka Trump for her love of Israel and her conversion to Judaism while delivering a speech at the Israeli Knesset on Monday.Trump was speaking following the return of hostages from Gaza and was being celebrated for his role in the deal.“Let me also give a special thanks to someone who truly loves Israel, in fact, loves it so much that…my daughter converted [to Judaism],” Trump said. “I didn’t know this was going to happen…and Bibi, you do know this wasn’t in the cards for me, you do understand that. She is so happy and they are so happy…they have a great marriage, and they get along great. They are best friends. They have a very special relationship.”Ivanka, who accompanied her father and husband Jared Kushner to Israel, converted to Judaism before marrying Kushner in 2009. Kushner has also played a key role in ending the Gaza war and securing the release of hostages. Trump thanked him in his speech for his efforts in both the peace deal and establishing the Abraham Accords.Trump told the Knesset that the day was one to “give thanks to the almighty God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” He also marked the first phase of a Gaza ceasefire, calling it an end to a ""long nightmare"" for both Israelis and Palestinians.“The forces of chaos that have plagued the region are totally defeated,” he said.The MAGA supremo received a standing ovation from members of the Knesset, though he was briefly interrupted by two left-wing politicians who were removed from the room. Trump continued, saying his administration would now turn its attention to ending the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Ivanka’s journey to Judaism began under Rabbi Haskel Lookstein of the Modern Orthodox Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun in New York, reports the Jerusalem Post. In a 2015 Vogue profile, she said she had ""always shied away from it being a public conversation because it's such a personal thing.""Trump has publicly expressed pride in Ivanka’s decision to live a Jewish life. Ahead of the birth of one of her children in 2016, he announced she was ""about to have a beautiful Jewish baby."" Ivanka has visited Israel several times, including trips to the Western Wall with Melania Trump and, recently, with Kushner and US Envoy Steve Witkoff, where she prayed for the success of her father’s 20-point Gaza peace plan.","US President Donald Trump praised his daughter, Ivanka Trump for her love of Israel and her conversion to Judaism.

Retaliatory Strike by Afghan Forces Kills 15 Pakistani Soldiers; Qatar Calls for Dialogue





NEW DELHI: Former Indian diplomat KP Fabian on Sunday described Pakistan’s foreign policy as a “failure” following its recent confrontation with Afghanistan, where Islamabad has been accused of carrying out strikes on Afghan territory.Speaking to news agency ANI, Fabian said Pakistan had acted as an aggressor and “played its hand badly,” resulting in deteriorating relations with Kabul.“This has happened when, maybe coincidentally, the Afghanistan Emirate foreign minister is in Delhi,” Fabian said, as per ANI.“The bad relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan cannot entirely be explained on the basis of the Durand Line. I think Pakistan played its hand badly, probably was overbearing. The proud Afghans resisted, and now the relationship is very bad,” he said.Fabian noted that Pakistan had carried out strikes on Kabul, prompting Afghanistan’s retaliation.“On the whole, Pakistani policy has been, more or less, a failure... It is abundantly clear that Afghanistan is keen on developing relations with India, which is the case with India too, and Pakistan is naturally upset,” he added.The Afghan ministry of defence has recently said that the armed forces of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan conducted “successful retaliatory operations” against Pakistani military positions along the Durand Line late Saturday night.In a statement cited by ANI, the ministry said the strikes were “in response to repeated violations of Afghanistan’s sovereignty by the Pakistani military and airstrikes on its territory.”According to news agency Associated Press (AP), Afghanistan claimed on Sunday that its forces had killed 58 Pakistani soldiers and captured 25 military posts in overnight operations along the border.Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said Afghan forces were in control of the “official borders and de facto lines,” though Pakistan has not confirmed any casualties.Both the Torkham and Chaman border crossings remained closed on Sunday following the escalation. Pakistan, for its part, accused Afghan authorities of harbouring militants of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a charge Kabul has denied.Tensions between the two countries have worsened in recent months, with frequent border skirmishes and airstrikes deepening distrust. Saudi Arabia has called for “restraint and dialogue” to prevent further escalation in the region.","Former Indian diplomat KP Fabian on Sunday described Pakistan’s foreign policy as a “failure” following its recent confrontation with Afghanistan.
