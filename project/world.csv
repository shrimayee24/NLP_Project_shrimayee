Magistrate Joshi ordered the cops to file the FIR under sections pertaining to promoting disharmony and communal enmity , criminal conspiracy and furthering a common agenda.After the communal violence in Balisana on July 16, 2023, Shekh filed his complaint on Sept 8, 2023 with Patan SP claiming a video showed some Patels inciting other villagers against Muslims. According to Shekh, the Patels had called for the economic boycott of Muslims by ending contracts to force them out of rented shops in the village market.After cops sat on his complaint, Shekh moved the Patan court demanding an FIR under several sections related to promoting enmity and IT Act as the alleged incitement was through a video. When the court ordered Balisana police to inquire, cops recommended closing the case. The police presented statements of the accused claiming they had called for boycott of Muslims because the latter had caused ""breach of peace and were likely to cause disturbances again"".The accused contended that while they had suggested to villagers to cancel some rent agreements, they had never forced any shop-owner to evict Muslim tenants.The court, however, did not believe the police report as the complainant's advocate, Yusuf Shaikh, placed statements by many Muslims saying they had lost livelihoods and shops around the time the boycott call was issued.","Magistrate HP Joshi asked police to register the FIRs after it emerged that many Muslims in Balisana village lost their livelihood and some had to leave.

Different Supreme Court benches hear 2 aspects of 2021 Nagaland Mon killings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/different-supreme-court-benches-hear-2-aspects-of-2021-nagaland-mon-killings/articleshow/112147699.cms,"New Delhi: In a piquant situation, two SC benches are adjudicating two aspects of an alleged botched Army operation in Dec 2021 in Nagaland - one challenging registration of FIR against Army personnel by the state police and the second, the state's challenge to Centre's refusal to sanction prosecution of the accused.A bench headed by Justice Vikram Nath was hearing petitions filed by spouses of Army personnel involved in the operation challenging registration of FIR by Nagaland Police .It had in July 2022 stayed prosecution of the personnel belonging to Alpha team of 21 Para (Special Forces) as the petitioners contended that FIR should have been registered only after taking Centre's consent.On Tuesday, with Justice Nath not persuaded by the argument that his bench should not hear the matter, Nagaland advocate general K N Balgopal sought adjournment of the hearing saying he was unwell.The sudden turn of events did not go down well with the bench which said the state AG should have informed the court about his indisposition at the start of the hearing. However, it agreed to adjourn the hearing to Aug 6.On July 15, a bench headed by the CJI had issued notice to Centre on Nagaland's plea challenging denial of sanction for prosecution of 30 Army men who were named in the FIR lodged by the state police for killing 13 civilians in a botched operation to ambush militants in Mon district on Dec 4, 2021.When the bench led by Justice Nath took up the petitions challenging registration of FIR, Balgopal said only one of the two benches should hear both the petitions, as these pertained to the same incident.However, senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi said Nagaland's writ petition challenging Centre's decision refusing sanction for prosecution concerned an issue which was completely different from the subject matter before this bench. ""We are questioning the very inception of the prosecution through registration of FIR. This bench had, during the earlier hearing, expressed its prima facie view that the FIR needs to be closed as there was no prior sanction for its registration,"" Ahmadi said.Ahmadi also accused Nagaland of suppressing facts in the writ petition before the CJI-led bench challenging a more than year-old decision of Union govt to refuse sanction for prosecution. ""None of the interim orders passed by this bench, including the one staying the FIR and prosecution of the Army personnel, was annexed to the writ petition even though the deponent was fully aware of the developments,"" he said.Justice Nath said even if the bench closed the FIRs, the prosecution could be commenced afresh if Nagaland govt succeeded before the CJI-led bench. Finding the wind blowing against the state, Balgopal sought adjournment of hearing saying he was unwell.","Two SC benches are adjudicating two aspects of an alleged botched Army operation in Dec 2021 in Nagaland.

Erdogan has previously likened Israel's actions in Gaza to those of Nazi Germany and compared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler.In response, Katz took to X (formerly Twitter) with a strong retort, saying, ""Erdogan is going down the path of Saddam Hussein and threatens to attack Israel. He should just remember what happened there and how that ended."" Katz's remarks draw a parallel between Erdogan's current stance and Saddam Hussein's downfall, which culminated in his execution by a US-backed coalition.Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid also criticized Erdogan, labeling him a ""danger to the Middle East"" and a ""wannabe dictator."" Lapid called on the international community, particularly NATO members, to condemn Erdogan's threats against Israel and to pressure him to cease his support for Hamas.The historical context of Katz's warning refers to Saddam Hussein's overthrow during the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq. Following his capture by US forces, Hussein was tried by an Iraqi court for crimes against humanity and executed by hanging in 2006. The US invasion, justified at the time by claims of Hussein's connections to Al-Qaeda and possession of weapons of mass destruction, later proved to be based on false premises, leading to widespread controversy over the legitimacy of the military action.As the situation develops, the international community watches closely, with Erdogan's provocative statements and the Israeli government's stern responses adding to the already volatile Middle Eastern landscape.",Israeli foreign minister Israel Katz has issued a stark warning to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Kamala Harris to hold first rally with VP pick in crucial Philadelphia: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-to-hold-first-rally-with-vp-pick-in-crucial-philadelphia-say-sources/articleshow/112152361.cms,"US Vice President Kamala Harris is set to hold her inaugural rally with her newly selected vice presidential nominee in Philadelphia on Tuesday, according to sources. The choice of location implies that Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro has emerged as a top contender on the shortlist of potential running mates.The Harris campaign seems to have concluded that the state, which Democrats reclaimed from Republicans in 2020, is crucial for securing victory once more, according to a report from Reuters.However, a campaign aide cautioned against overinterpreting the significance of the first city chosen for the weeklong battleground state tour, which is expected to span four days and multiple states. The decision on Harris's running mate has taken centre stage since she became the Democratic frontrunner for the November 5 election , following US President Joe Biden 's withdrawal from the race just over a week ago.The shortlist of candidates under consideration includes governor Shapiro, Kentucky governor Andy Beshear, Arizona senator Mark Kelly, Minnesota governor Tim Walz, and secretary of transportation Pete Buttigieg.If Shapiro is selected, the Harris campaign is likely banking on the popular 51-year-old governor's ability to help secure the state in November. Shapiro's popularity among Democrats surged after he decisively defeated his Republican opponent, Doug Mastriano, garnering 56 per cent of the vote in a state known for close elections.Additionally, Shapiro would become the second Jewish nominee for vice president on a major ticket in US history, following Joe Lieberman's unsuccessful bid with Al Gore in 2000.Traditionally, campaigns begin considering their vice-presidential pick after the primary race concludes in the spring, allowing ample time for candidate vetting and ensuring personal and political compatibility. However, Harris faces a compressed timeline, with the Democratic National Committee setting an August 7 deadline.Eric Holder Jr, who oversaw Barack Obama's vice-presidential vetting process in 2008, is currently vetting Harris's potential picks through his law firm, Covington & Burling.The candidates are informally showcasing their potential contributions to the Harris ticket through media appearances and campaign stops. Governor Shapiro delivered a compelling testimonial about Harris in the Philadelphia suburbs on Monday, declaring, ""She's not only ready, she's damned ready. And you know who else knows she's ready? Donald Trump knows she's ready.""Meanwhile, Minnesota Governor Walz is credited with advancing the Democrats' new criticism of Trump and his running mate J D Vance, characterising them as ""weird."" Walz said on Saturday, ""The fascists depend on us going back, but we're not afraid of weird people. We're a little bit creeped out, but we're not afraid.""",US Vice President Kamala Harris is set to hold her inaugural rally with her newly selected vice presidential nominee in Philadelphia on Tuesday.

She has also portrayed him as responsible for a wave of anti-abortion measures in Republican-led states nationwide.The scale of the Harris campaign's ad buy overshadows the $10 million advertising campaign announced by Trump's team on Monday, which is set to be launched in six battleground states this week as part of an effort to counter the surge of voter enthusiasm and donations for Harris.

Kamala Harris's 'weird' campaign strategy: How Democrats are trying to make Trump laughingstock,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harriss-weird-campaign-strategy-how-democrats-are-trying-to-make-trump-laughingstock/articleshow/112151865.cms,"As the 2024 presidential election heats up, the word "" weird "" is becoming the Democrats ' not-so-secret weapon against former President Donald Trump . The term, used repeatedly by Vice President Kamala Harris and her team, is intended to paint Trump as not just a flawed candidate but an outright oddball, a stark contrast to the formal and sometimes grandiose rhetoric of President Joe Biden.In a recent campaign statement, Harris captured the essence of this strategy, referring to Trump as “old and quite weird.” This isn’t just idle chatter; it’s part of a calculated effort to reshape Trump’s public image from a political powerhouse to an unpleasant, laughable figure.“Just plain weird,” Harris herself declared at a recent event, making it clear that her campaign aims to turn the former president into a national punchline.Trump’s response to this tactic has been predictable. Known for his ability to mock opponents with biting humor, Trump has shown visible irritation at being the subject of ridicule. “I hate when people laugh at me,” he lamented at a rally earlier this month. His discomfort with being the butt of jokes seems to play right into Harris’s hands.The Harris campaign has embraced this approach with gusto. Their recent press releases are a masterclass in modern political mockery. Descriptions of Trump include phrases like “bitter, unhinged” and “generally sounded like someone you wouldn’t want to sit near at a restaurant—let alone be president.” The idea is to minimize Trump’s stature and present him as an increasingly erratic figure.The campaign’s jabs extend beyond Trump himself to his vice presidential pick, J.D. Vance. Vance’s past remarks about “childless cat ladies,” which belittled women like Harris who haven’t had children, have earned him the label of “super weird” from Democratic senators. Adding fuel to the fire, a viral fake news story about Vance and a sofa, while entirely fabricated, has been used to fuel a deluge of memes and jokes that have further cemented his status as an oddity in the public’s eye.Hillary Clinton, ever the sharp critic, summed up the strategy succinctly: “If Republican leaders don’t enjoy being called weird, creepy, and controlling, they could try not being weird, creepy, and controlling.” Her words echo the new tone of Harris’s campaign, which is less about policy and more about poking fun at Trump and his allies.This approach has caught the Trump campaign off guard. After President Biden’s unexpected withdrawal from the race and Harris’s rapid rise, the Trump team has found itself scrambling. The former president, who has traditionally thrived on verbal sparring, now faces a different kind of battle.In response, Trump and his allies have attempted to turn the tables. Trump has labeled Harris with a series of insults including “dumb,” “nuts,” and “a bum.” His son, Donald Trump Jr., has been leading the charge to flip the “weird” narrative back at the Democrats. On social media, he’s used crude language to attack Harris’s support for gender reassignment surgery for prison inmates, suggesting that her priorities are out of touch.Trump himself has even taken to mocking Harris’s laughter, trying to brand her with a new nickname: “laughing Kamala.” He’s suggested that her laugh reveals something sinister, aiming to discredit her through her mannerisms.As the campaign trail heats up, it’s clear that the battle will be as much about perceptions and humor as it is about policies. Whether the “weird” strategy will stick or if Trump’s counterattacks will shift the narrative remains to be seen. One thing is certain: the 2024 election is shaping up to be one of the most unconventional in recent history.","Vice President Kamala Harris and her team are using the term ""weird"" to attack former President Donald Trump.

The event had over 190,000 participants, including notable figures such as 'Star Wars' actor Mark Hamill and singer Josh Groban.The 'White Dudes for Harris' event lasted over three hours and focused on the importance of white men supporting Harris in the upcoming November 5 presidential election against Republican Donald Trump.Harris is currently serving as vice president.The event was organised by Ross Morales Rocketto, founder of 'Run for Something,' who cited that over 60% of US white men voted for Trump in both the 2016 and 2020 elections.Mitch Landrieu, a Harris campaign co-chair, said ""If white guys would just show up, if we would stand up and be counted, if we would talk about what it really means to be a great partner, and a man, which is to protect, and to help, and to lift up, and to not push down, all of us are going to be better for it,"" Landrieu said during the call.The video call is part of a series of similar events hosted for Harris, which have consistently attracted large audiences and have been successful in raising significant funds since the evening President Joe Biden endorsed Harris.The event featured other high-profile guests like Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and actor Jeff Bridges. Bridges noted his connection to the event through his role as 'The Dude' in the film 'The Big Lebowski.' Other notable attendees included North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker.Actor Bradley Whitford, who starred in 'Get Out' and 'The West Wing,' commented on the diversity within the group of white men supporting Harris.""What a variety of whiteness we have here,"" said Whitford. ""We got The Dude. We got Pete (Buttigieg). It's like a rainbow of, uh, beige.""Speakers during the call highlighted the mutual benefits for white men in supporting the rights of others, particularly reproductive rights for women. This has been a key issue in Harris's and the Democratic Party's campaign.LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and filmmaker J.J. Abrams each pledged to match $50,000 in donations accrued during the call. The event generated over 60,000 individual contributions, according to Morales Rocketto.""Smash that donate button,"" 'Frozen' actor Josh Gad urged attendees.Previous video calls supporting Harris have also drawn considerable attention and funds. A call for Black women supporters had over 40,000 participants, another for Black men attracted more than 50,000. Separate calls for South Asian women and LGBTQ allies, as well as a call for white women which raised over $11 million and had more than 200,000 participants, were part of the campaign's strategy.","The 'White Dudes for Harris' event lasted over three hours and focused on the importance of white men supporting Kamala Harris.

Kim jong is reportedly suffering with conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes, according to South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS).At 40 years old, Kim has a family history of heart problems, with both his father and grandfather dying from heart-related issues. Known for his heavy drinking and smoking habits, Kim is approximately 170 centimeters (5 feet, 8 inches) tall and previously weighed 140 kilograms (308 pounds). Despite appearing to have lost a significant amount of weight in 2021, possibly due to dietary changes, recent state media footage suggests he has regained the lost weight, reported AP.Lawmaker Lee Seong Kweun stated that the NIS estimates Kim's current weight to be around 140 kilograms (308 pounds), placing him in a high-risk group for heart disease. ""Kim has shown symptoms of high blood pressure and diabetes since his early 30s,"" Lee said. Lawmaker Park Sunwon added that the NIS believes Kim's obesity is linked to his drinking, smoking, and stress.The NIS also informed lawmakers that North Korean officials have been attempting to procure new medicines from abroad to address Kim's suspected high blood pressure and diabetes.Kim's health is a topic of significant interest beyond North Korea's borders, as he has not formally named a successor, raising concerns about who would take charge of the country's growing nuclear arsenal in the event of his incapacitation.During Monday's briefing, the NIS reiterated its assessment that Kim's preteen daughter, reportedly named Kim Ju Ae, appears to be bolstering her status as her father's heir apparent. However, the NIS noted that it cannot entirely rule out the possibility that one of her siblings could replace her as the successor, given that she has not been officially designated as her father's successor.Speculation about Kim Ju Ae, who is about 10 years old, began to spread when she started accompanying her father to high-profile public events in late 2022. State media have referred to her as Kim Jong Un's ""most beloved"" or ""respected"" child and have released numerous photos and footage showcasing her increasing political prominence and her close relationship with her father. The NIS reported to lawmakers that at least 60% of Kim Ju Ae's public appearances have involved being present at military events with her father.","North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has reportedly regained weight and is now facing health issues related to obesity.

In 2021, Vance’s rhetoric found its way into fundraising emails, where he continued to target childless individuals. “We’ve allowed ourselves to be dominated by childless sociopaths – they’re invested in NOTHING because they’re not invested in this country’s children,” Vance wrote in one email. Another message described childless Democrats as “miserable in their own lives and want to make the rest of the country miserable too.”The resurfacing of these comments has fueled intense criticism and raised questions about Vance’s suitability as a vice presidential candidate. Critics argue that such divisive language and disdain for individuals without children could alienate voters and undermine the Republican ticket’s appeal.Vance has defended his remarks, claiming they were meant to critique specific left-leaning policies rather than attack individuals personally. “He was talking about politicians on the left who support policies that are explicitly anti-child and anti-family,” a spokesperson for Vance said. “The media can obsess over it all they want, but he’s not going to back down when it comes to advocating for policies that protect parental rights and encourage people to have more kids.”Despite his defense, the timing of these comments is politically sensitive. Vance’s vice presidential nomination under Trump, a figure also known for his polarizing rhetoric, has amplified the scrutiny on his past statements. The Trump campaign, already facing its own controversies, now has to navigate the fallout from Vance’s inflammatory remarks.The reaction from the public and media has been swift and sharp. Prominent voices on social media and in the press have criticized Vance’s characterization of childless individuals, with many arguing that such views reflect an outdated and narrow-minded perspective.As the 2024 election race intensifies, Vance’s remarks add another layer of complexity to the already contentious political landscape. Whether the controversy will have lasting implications for his candidacy and the Republican ticket remains to be seen, but it is clear that Vance’s comments have sparked a significant and ongoing debate.","Ohio Senator JD Vance is being considered as Donald Trump’s 2024 running mate.

Young people are channelling their 'inner brat' by using the album's chartreuse (that's French for lime green) aesthetic in different ways.Social media is filled with people sipping green drinks and dyeing their hair that fiery green.

Who feels herself but maybe also has a breakdown ... is very honest, very blunt, a little bit volatile"".Within hours of US President Joe Biden bowing out of the race, a Harris meme with the BRAT theme started doing the rounds. But it was not till Charli XCX posted ""Kamala IS brat"" that all hell broke loose. Harris's official X account, @kamalahq, then changed its banner to the avocado green colour of the album. The campaign accounts has since amassed millions of views across Instagram, TikTok and X this week by engaging with a mix of memes, video clips and jokes in which she is the star including an awkwardly dancing Harris from an old video overlaid on an image out of the ""Brat summer"" viral aesthetic, with a liberal dose of coconut trees or stepping out of Air Force One in different-coloured suits, and screenshots of news articles against the sound, popularised on TikTok, of a cash register bell and someone saying ""I can't stop winning.""Some have already made brat x Kamala Harris merch with t-shirts that include slogans such as ""the election and it's the same but kamala is running so it's not"", ""i'm so kamala,"" and ""brats 4 kamala"" The strategy is risky, experts said. Leaning too hard into a meme can drain its fun, alienate people who don't get it, or distract from messages on policy and the seriousness of voting.Source: Bloomberg, The Atlantic, The Conversation","Singer Charli XCX recently released her new album, BRAT which has become a critical and commercial success. Young people are channelling their 'inner brat' by using the album's chartreuse (that's French for lime green) aesthetic in different ways.

Did JD Vance spark another controversy? Senator's book endorsement raises eyebrows in Trump campaign's transition plans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-jd-vance-spark-another-controversy-senators-book-endorsement-raises-eyebrows-in-trump-campaigns-transition-plans/articleshow/112151866.cms,"Ohio Senator JD Vance , Donald Trump's running mate, has praised Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts in the foreword of Roberts' forthcoming book, “Dawn’s Early Light.” This endorsement could complicate the Trump campaign 's efforts to distance itself from the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 transition initiative.The Associated Press obtained a copy of the foreword on Tuesday, the same day a significant shakeup occurred within Project 2025, which has become a contentious election-year issue.Critics, including Democrats, argue that the nearly 1,000-page vision outlined by Project 2025 is extreme.“Never before has a figure with Roberts’s depth and stature within the American Right tried to articulate a genuinely new future for conservatism,” Vance writes in his foreword. “The Heritage Foundation isn’t some random outpost on Capitol Hill; it is and has been the most influential engine of ideas for Republicans from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump.”Vance’s endorsement highlights the alignment between Trump’s allies and those driving Project 2025. Despite this, Trump’s top aides have criticized the organizers of Project 2025 for creating a false impression of association with the campaign. Following Tuesday’s shakeup, Roberts has taken direct control of Project 2025 operations.Set for publication on September 24, the book outlines a vision for what the publisher describes as a peaceful ""Second American Revolution.” The subtitle is “Taking Back Washington to Save America,” though earlier versions had listed it as “Burning Down Washington to Save America.”The publisher’s description of the book includes a call to build or reclaim certain institutions, suggesting that some are “too corrupt to save.” Among those listed are Ivy League colleges, the FBI, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Department of Education, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.The AP reached out to spokespeople for Vance and the Trump campaign for comments.On Tuesday, Paul Dans, who had directed Project 2025, left the Heritage Foundation amid ongoing criticism of the plan. Roberts stated that Dans’ departure came after the project accomplished its initial goals.In his foreword, Vance advocates for a proactive approach to conservatism, beyond just dismantling past policies. “We need an offensive conservatism, not merely one that tries to prevent the left from doing things we don’t like,” he writes.Vance concludes by quoting Roberts: “When twilight descends and a person hears wolves, you’ve got to circle the wagons and load the muskets.” Vance adds, “We are now all realizing that it’s time to circle the wagons and load the muskets. In the fights that lay ahead, these ideas are an essential weapon.”DNC spokesman Alex Floyd responded, saying Vance's language “echoes the same dangerous rhetoric we’ve heard from him and Donald Trump for years.""Vance’s foreword also touches on personal themes, including his and Roberts’ challenging upbringings, influential grandparents, and shared Catholic faith. He discusses the importance of parenthood, recently a contentious topic for him following resurfaced comments where he criticized “childless cat ladies” in Democratic leadership.In the book, Vance praises the idea of encouraging marriage and parenthood, reflecting the old American Right’s belief that cultural norms and attitudes are significant.The book’s publication and the ongoing debates around Project 2025 promise to keep these issues at the forefront of political discourse as the election approaches.","Ohio Senator JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate, has praised Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts in the foreword of Roberts' forthcoming book.

Kamala Harris dares Trump: 'Say it to my face' as she challenges him to debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/say-it-to-my-face-kamala-harris-taunts-donald-trump-at-atlanta-rally-energizes-supporters-ahead-of-2024-us-election/articleshow/112151732.cms,"US Vice President Kamala Harris electrified a packed arena in Atlanta on Tuesday, rallying thousands of enthusiastic supporters and emphasizing that the next 98 days would be a fight worth winning. As she taunted Donald Trump for his indecision about participating in their upcoming debate , Harris declared, “The momentum in this race is shifting. And there are signs Donald Trump is feeling it.”Just over a week ago, Georgia seemed to be slipping from the Democrats' grasp, with President Joe Biden's campaign focusing on securing the Midwestern ""blue wall"" states, potentially at the expense of the ""Sun Belt"" battlegrounds.However, Biden's abrupt exit from the race and Harris emerging as the likely nominee has rejuvenated Democratic hopes of broadening the electoral map.In a state that handed Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020, Harris mirrored a classic Trump-style event: a raucous rally filled with supporters, who cheered her on as she criticized Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, labeling their policies as outdated and dangerous. “I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed and I will sign it and show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like,” Harris proclaimed, referencing Trump’s opposition to a bipartisan immigration bill.Trump, who had initially agreed to debate Harris, is now wavering, saying he “probably” will debate but can “also make a case for not doing it.” Harris seized on his indecision, challenging him directly, “Meet me on the debate stage ... because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face.” Trump has called for the debate, scheduled for September 10 on ABC News, to be moved to a different network, dismissing ABC as “fake news.”The 8,000-capacity arena at Georgia State University was filled to the rafters with supporters waving signs, dancing to campaign music, and enjoying a performance by Megan Thee Stallion. This vibrant scene contrasted sharply with the uncertainty that surrounded the Democratic party just 10 days ago, as doubts about Biden’s age and capabilities ultimately led to the end of his campaign.“This is like Barack Obama 2008 on steroids for me,” said Mildred Hobson Doss, a 59-year-old from suburban Lilburn. “I would have voted for President Biden again. But we are ready.”Harris' campaign asserts that her appeal to young people, working-age women, and non-white voters has altered the dynamics in Georgia and similar states like North Carolina, Nevada, and Arizona. A strategy memo from Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon, formerly Biden’s campaign chair, emphasized the necessity of winning Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania but also highlighted the new opportunities Harris brings to attract Black, Latino, and young voters in states like Georgia.“The energy is infectious,” said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams. “My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.”Harris began her day by highlighting her prosecutorial background, contrasting it with Trump’s legal troubles, while vigorously defending the Biden administration's record. She pledged to pass voting rights legislation and restore reproductive rights lost after the fall of Roe v. Wade. “America has tried these failed policies before. And we are not going back,” she declared, to chants of “we're not going back” from the crowd.Republicans argue that concerns over high consumer prices and immigration issues will impact Harris negatively in the traditionally conservative state. However, they acknowledge that the race now resembles the tightly contested 2020 more than it did a few weeks ago.“Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,” said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. “The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.”In response, Trump announced a rally in the same Georgia State arena for Saturday, underscoring the fierce competition ahead. Robinson admitted that while Harris has her weaknesses, including progressive stances from her 2020 primary campaign, she has been “in command” so far, making the race competitive in Georgia.Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed Harris as “just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden,” arguing she must explain her support for policies that allegedly harmed Georgia families. Nonetheless, Harris’ campaign and Georgia Democrats have mobilized significantly, with 24 offices across the state, including two new ones in metro Atlanta.Harris, addressing supporters post-speech, stressed the urgency of the campaign, noting that early voting begins in just 38 days. While she has yet to formally clinch the nomination or choose a running mate, these decisions are expected imminently.“This is a sprint,"" she said. ""And we know what we need to do to cross the finish line.”Harris’ campaign strategy involves winning over voters in Atlanta’s growing suburbs and exurbs, targeting moderates disenchanted with Trump. For many, her candidacy represents a fresh start.“I've voted Republican many times in my life,” said Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite from Forsyth County. “Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,"" he said, expressing disdain for Trump.Allen Smith, a 41-year-old Atlanta native, has become a first-time campaign volunteer for Harris. “I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,” he said, recounting his reaction to Biden’s endorsement of Harris.","US Vice President Kamala Harris electrified a packed arena in Atlanta on Tuesday, rallying thousands of enthusiastic supporters.

This strike, reported by Iraqi sources to have resulted in at least four deaths, is the first by American forces in Iraq since February. During that prior incident, the US military claimed to have killed a pro-Iran commander involved in attacks on US troops.""Tonight, US forces in Iraq conducted a defensive air strike in Babylon province , targeting combatants attempting to launch one-way attack uncrewed aerial systems,"" a US defense official was quoted as saying.The Central Command evaluated that the drones ""posed a threat to US and coalition forces."" The official added, ""We maintain the inherent right to self-defense and will not hesitate to take appropriate action.""The Hashed al-Shaabi, an alliance of pro-Iran former paramilitary groups integrated into Iraq's security forces, reported that apparent missile strikes had killed four people at a base in Babylon. However, they did not mention any drone launch attempts. ""Available information suggests that two patrols were targeted with missiles fired from drones,"" the Hashed said in a statement.An official from the Hashed al-Shaabi was quoted as saying that ""four people were killed and others were critically wounded in blasts that hit a base belonging to the Hashed al-Shaabi."" A security source confirmed the four deaths and noted that the death toll could rise.This air strike follows two recent attacks targeting US and allied forces in Iraq. Last week, several rockets were launched toward the Ain al-Assad base, which hosts US-led coalition troops combating the Islamic State group. On July 16, two drones were launched toward the same facility; one was ""successfully destroyed,"" while the other caused ""minimal damage,"" according to the Pentagon.US troops in Iraq and Syria had not been targeted since April before these recent incidents. However, attacks were frequent during the initial months of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, with more than 175 attacks reported. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of Iran-backed groups, claimed most of these attacks, citing solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.In January, a drone strike blamed on these groups killed three US soldiers at a base in Jordan. In retaliation, US forces launched dozens of strikes against Tehran-backed fighters. Since then, attacks on US troops have significantly decreased.Baghdad has been engaging in talks with Washington to defuse tensions and discuss the future of the US-led coalition's mission in Iraq. The US military maintains approximately 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 in Syria. The coalition was initially deployed to Iraq at the government's request in 2014 to help combat the Islamic State group, which had taken over large swathes of Iraq and Syria. Despite the coalition's efforts, IS remnants continue to carry out attacks and ambushes in both countries.","U.S. forces carried out a ""defensive"" air strike against combatants who were attempting to launch drones.

Has Kamala Harris decided on US vice presidential running mate?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/has-kamala-harris-decided-on-us-vice-presidential-running-mate/articleshow/112151648.cms,"In a whirlwind of political activity, Kamala Harris is on the cusp of announcing her choice for vice presidential running mate , with plans for a joint tour of crucial battleground states soon to follow, as per the report by CNN . This decisive step comes just days after Harris was unexpectedly propelled into the presidential candidate role, following President Joe Biden 's sudden withdrawal from the race.As per CNN sources close to the process reveal that Harris has been diligently reviewing extensive dossiers on each of the leading contenders, engaging in preliminary discussions, and seeking counsel from trusted advisers. Formal interviews with top candidates are set to begin this week.The Harris campaign faces an unprecedentedly tight schedule, having to swiftly evaluate and vet potential running mates. This effort has included scrutinizing video footage of the candidates and conducting in-depth background checks. The top names under consideration are Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Notably, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper has opted out of the race, while Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear are still in the mix, though not seen as frontrunners.Leading the vetting team is former Attorney General Eric Holder, supported by a cadre of Democratic lawyers examining financial records and personal histories of the contenders. Tony West, Harris' brother-in-law and former Associate Attorney General, is also playing a pivotal advisory role in the selection process.Strategically, the Harris campaign is keenly focused on boosting electoral prospects. Polling indicates that candidates like Shapiro and Kelly could significantly sway voters in key battleground states. Pennsylvania, with its 19 electoral votes, is deemed particularly critical, potentially being the tipping point for the election's outcome.Choosing Shapiro, who is Jewish, could also offer Harris political leverage on Middle Eastern policy, a topic on which she has taken a more assertive stance than Biden. However, Shapiro's candidacy is not without complications, including the recent scandal involving his former aide, Mike Vereb, who resigned amid a sexual harassment investigation.Despite some Democrats urging an announcement at the upcoming Democratic convention in Chicago, Harris appears intent on naming her vice presidential pick sooner. With only three months left until Election Day, the urgency to solidify the ticket and hit the campaign trail is palpable.“She, better than anyone aside from a couple other people on earth, knows what the job of VP entails, for better and for worse,” a close friend of Harris was quoted as saying, emphasizing her search for a partner who can effectively complement her and address any electoral vulnerabilities.","Kamala Harris is on the cusp of announcing her choice for vice presidential running mate.

Thousands of firefighters are engaged in a round-the-clock battle against the Park Fire , which is raging through a wilderness area north of Sacramento.More than 5,500 firefighters from across California and other states are working tirelessly to contain the fire, which is burning in the state’s Central Valley, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) north of Sacramento, the capital.The fire has grown to 385,065 acres (155,830 hectares), making it the fifth-largest wildfire in California's history.On Tuesday, the Park Fire overtook the 2020 Creek Fire in Fresno County, which burned nearly 380,000 acres. However, it remains smaller than the state’s largest fire on record, the August Complex Fire of 2020, which scorched more than 1 million acres across seven northern California counties. The Park Fire, driven by dry grass, brush, and timber, is advancing rapidly, said Fire Captain Dan Collins of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).""This fire has plenty of fuel that's highly combustible and difficult to access,"" Collins stated. ""Our fire line stretches 260 miles, which is roughly the size of three Lake Tahoes. It can take two to three hours for personnel to reach certain areas due to the challenging terrain.""The National Weather Service predicts only a slight chance of isolated thunderstorms on Tuesday, with no significant rainfall expected in the near future. Meteorologist Ashton Robinson Cook indicated that the weather would remain hot and extremely dry, with temperatures projected to reach 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8°C) on Wednesday and persist at that level through next Monday. Relative humidity levels could drop as low as 7%.The Park Fire, which was only 14% contained as of Tuesday, has led to the evacuation of more than 4,000 people and caused damage or destruction to over 192 structures. Fortunately, no injuries or fatalities have been reported.Jeremy Hollingshead, a spokesperson for Cal Fire, mentioned that heavy smoke has grounded the 41 helicopters assigned to drop water and fire-retardant chemicals on the blaze.Evacuations have included the town of Paradise, which was devastated by the 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest wildfire in California’s history.The man accused of starting the Park Fire, allegedly by pushing a flaming car down a Butte County gully last Wednesday, has been formally charged with arson. Ronnie Dean Stout II, 42, of Chico, California, denied the allegations during his arraignment on Monday, as stated by Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey during a news conference. It remains unclear if Stout has legal representation.Stout did not enter a plea but was denied bail. His arraignment has been continued to Thursday, as additional charges may be filed, Ramsey noted.","More than 5,500 firefighters from across California and other states are working tirelessly to contain the Park Fire.

If found guilty of the charges brought against him, Guzman Lopez may face the death penalty.Guzman Lopez was apprehended in an operation allegedly orchestrated by Washington without Mexico's involvement, resulting in his arrest in Texas on Thursday. The presiding judge denied bail, remanded him into custody, and scheduled a case management hearing for September 30, as stated by the assistant US Attorney's office in a statement to AFP.Many aspects of the arrest operation, which also led to the apprehension of Ismael Zambada Garcia, known as ""El Mayo,"" a co-founder of the cartel, and his subsequent transfer to US custody, remain unclear. Zambada has also pleaded not guilty and has been remanded in custody.According to US law enforcement sources cited by media outlets, Zambada was unknowingly lured across the Mexico border by Guzman Lopez, one of El Chapo's four sons. A US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) report released in May suggests that the sons were engaged in an ""internal battle"" against Zambada, their father's former partner.Court documents previously released by prosecutors reveal that a federal grand jury indicted Guzman Lopez on charges of drug trafficking, money laundering, and weapons offenses. CNN reported that Jeffrey Lichtman, Guzman Lopez's lawyer, informed reporters that his client faces the death penalty in the case. Lichtman did not respond to AFP's request for comment.Guzman Lopez, who is in his 30s, is one of El Chapo's sons collectively known as Los Chapitos, or ""The Little Chapos."" El Chapo himself was convicted of drug charges in New York in 2019 and is currently serving a life sentence in a maximum security prison.Anne Milgram, the DEA chief, stated that Zambada's arrest ""strikes at the heart of the cartel that is responsible for the majority of drugs, including fentanyl and methamphetamine, killing Americans from coast to coast.""","Joaquin Guzman Lopez is the son of former Sinaloa drug cartel leader El Chapo.

He took three bullets, in his heart, stomach and arm, and died on the spot,” a police report said, adding Rehman lived alone and his family was abroad.The assassination has mortified the persecuted community, which faced a backlash and lost several of its members since this Feb when the Supreme Court granted bail to Mubarak Sani, one of its followers, in a blasphemy case.On Sunday, the Ahmadis condemned the doctor’s murder, calling it part of a larger and intense hate campaign against them. They expressed outrage and disappointment over the govt’s lack of action against such elements.Community spokesperson Amir Mehmood stressed that the doctor was targeted merely because he belonged to a different faith. Prior to this, Mehmood said two Ahmadis, Ghulam Sarwar and Rahat Ahmad Bajwa, were killed in Punjab’s Mandi Bahauddin and Hasilpur.
