Operation Sindoor vs Balakot: India raises the stakes with deep strikes in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-pahalgam-avenged-india-strikes-terror-camp-in-pakistan-pok/articleshow/120948721.cms,"Out of the nine targets chosen by India, four were in Pakistan and the remaining five were in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

Why it matters: A quantum leap from Balakot

Hit more targets (nine vs one in Balakot)

Penetrated deeper into Pakistani territory (striking Bahawalpur and Muridke), and

Employed sophisticated precision munitions, including loitering drones.

Security analyst Aadil Mir told ANI: “India has crossed two significant thresholds… striking multiple sites and targeting Pakistan’s heartland. This goes far beyond 2019.”

Zoom in: The strikes and what they hit

Execution & technology:

The strikes were carried out entirely from Indian airspace using a mix of:

Loitering munitions (which hover before attacking),

Precision-guided missiles, and

Air Force, Navy, and Army strike coordination.

Targets included:

Markaz Subhan Allah (Bahawalpur) - JeM HQ

Markaz Taiba (Muridke) - LeT’s main base

Syedna Bilal & Shwawai Nalla camps (Muzaffarabad) - JeM & LeT hubs

Makaz Raheel Shahid & Mehmoona Joya (Kotli & Sialkot) - Hizbul Mujahideen sites

Other logistical, training and recruitment centers in Barnala and Tehra Kalan

Indian military sources confirmed the intent was to “decapitate” leadership and logistics across JeM, LeT, and Hizbul Mujahideen infrastructure.

The symbolism

Sindoor

What they're saying

Following Operation Sindoor, the Indian Army said on 'X': ""Justice is Served.""

Defence ministry: “Focused, measured, and non-escalatory… no Pakistani military sites were targeted.”

Defence minister Rajnath Singh: “Bharat Mata Ki Jai.”

Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria (Retd): “Nine terrorist sites and their infrastructure were targeted… A fitting response under PM Modi’s direction to inflict unimaginable punishment.”

US President Donald Trump said at an unrelated White House interaction with news reporters: “We just heard about it as we were walking through the doors of the Oval ... They've been fighting for a long time. ... I just hope it ends very quickly.”

Between the lines: This was not Balakot 2.0 - it’s a new doctrine

More importantly, Sindoor introduced:

Wider spatial escalation - hitting targets near Lahore (Muridke) and Sialkot.

Higher operational tempo - All nine strikes occurred within minutes.

Zero intrusion strategy - India used standoff weapons, minimizing airspace breach and escalation risk.

The big picture: Why now, and what changed?

What’s next: Escalation or deterrence?

Ceasefire violations:

India’s stance:

The takeaway: A new red line has been drawn

Operation Sindoor

Raised the cost of cross-border terrorism,

Expanded its military playbook, and

Sent a clear message: No more sanctuaries, even in Pakistan’s heartland.

India also showed its restraint and maturity by not hitting military targets, avoiding a full-scale escalation - even as it delivered a strategic blow to terror infrastructure.

As Brigadier Hemant Mahajan (Retd) put it:

""This was a world-class, precision strike. The Armed Forces must be complimented. We hit them when they least expected it - and hit them hard.""

In a bold and coordinated military action, the Indian armed forces carried out Operation Sindoor - a high-precision missile strike targeting nine terror camps deep inside Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK). The operation was launched in retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack , which killed 25 Indian civilians and a Nepali national just two weeks earlier.The targets included JeM's Bahawalpur HQ, LeT’s base in Muridke, and several key infrastructure hubs of Hizbul Mujahideen, marking India’s most comprehensive cross-border military strike in over 50 years.India's previous cross-border strikes - the 2016 surgical strikes and the 2019 Balakot airstrikes - were relatively limited in scope and geography. In contrast, Operation Sindoor:The operation's name,, is derived from the red vermillion Hindu women wear to signify marriage — a nod to the Pahalgam widows, including one whose Navy officer husband was gunned down in front of her.While both Balakot and Sindoor were retaliatory anti-terror operations:Balakot (2019): Targeted a single JeM training camp in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Sindoor (2025): Targeted multiple, geographically dispersed terror sites, including deep inside Pakistan’s Punjab.The Pahalgam terror attack on April 22 - where civilians, including security families, were massacred - generated national outrage and international concern.PM Narendra Modi, in an April 29 security briefing, gave the armed forces ""complete operational freedom"". This green greenlight, combined with high-quality intelligence and technological advances, led to the execution of a strike unprecedented since the 1971 war.India then moved swiftly to brief world powers, including the US, UK, Russia, UAE, and Saudi Arabia, explaining the non-escalatory nature of the operation.NSA Ajit Doval spoke directly to US NSA and secretary of state Marco Rubio, laying out evidence of Pakistan-based terror links to Pahalgam.Hours after the strikes, Pakistan’s army opened artillery fire along the LoC in Jammu’s Bhimber Gali area, killing three Indian civilians. India’s army said it was responding in a “calibrated manner.”New Delhi is projecting this as a deterrence-by-punishment strategy - precise, contained, and legally justified. “We only hit known terror camps,” the Indian embassy in New York emphasized.With, India has:(With inputs from agencies)","Operation Sindoor targeted nine terror camps deep in Pakistan and Pakistan- occupied Kashmir (PoK) The strikes were carried out entirely from Indian airspace using a mix of:Loitering munitions (which hover before attacking), precision-guided missiles, and air force, Navy, and Army strike coordination.

Here's what we know so far:

The Indian Armed Forces launched ‘Operation Sindoor’ on Wednesday, targeting terrorist camps in Pakistan.

The operation was carried out in response to the recent Pahalgam terror attack that claimed the lives of 25 Indians and one Nepali citizen.

A total of nine terrorist infrastructure sites were hit during the operation, according to the Ministry of Defence (MoD).

The strikes focused on areas from where attacks against India were reportedly being planned and directed.

The MoD clarified that the operation was focused, measured, and non-escalatory in nature.

The government reaffirmed its commitment to holding those responsible for the Pahalgam attack accountable.

A detailed briefing on Operation Sindoor is scheduled to take place later today.

In a post on X, the Indian Army said, “Justice is served. Jai Hind!”

Pakistan violated the Ceasefire Agreement by firing artillery in Bhimber Gali, located in the Poonch-Rajouri area of Jammu and Kashmir, hours after India launched Operation Sindoor.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh publicly expressed national pride following Operation Sindoor, declaring ""Bharat Mata Ki Jai"" in support of the armed forces.

Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath voiced support for the military by posting ""Jai Hind! Jai Hind Ki Sena!"" on social media.

Union Minister Piyush Goyal also backed the strikes, sharing “Bharat Mata Ki Jai #OperationSindoor” in a post online.

US President Donald Trump said he had just been informed about India’s Operation Sindoor as he entered the Oval Office, calling the situation ""a shame"".

Trump remarked that ""people knew something was going to happen,"" suggesting the strike was anticipated due to past tensions.

He commented on the historical India-Pakistan conflict, saying they’ve been fighting “for centuries” and added, “I hope it ends very quickly.”

NEW DELHI: India has launched a major military operation, codenamed Operation Sindoor , targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK and in a direct response to the Pahalgam terror attack that left 26 people dead, including 25 Indian nationals and one Nepali citizen.The strikes come amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan following the Pahalgam massacre, where most of the victims were reportedly tourists. The ministry of defence has stated that a detailed briefing on Operation Sindoor will be held later today to provide further clarity on the objectives, outcomes, and intelligence behind the mission.A total of nine (9) sites have been precisely targeted. Our operations have been deliberate, restrained, and non-escalatory. No Pakistani military installations were struck. India has exercised significant restraint in both the choice of targets and the manner of execution. These actions follow the heinous terrorist attack in Pahalgam, which claimed the lives of 25 Indian citizens and one Nepali national. We remain firmly committed to holding those responsible accountable. A detailed briefing on ‘OPERATION SINDOOR’ will be provided later today, the defence ministry said.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declared that Pakistan reserves the full right to deliver a firm response to what he described as an act of war by India—adding that such a response is already underway.He added that the entire nation stands united behind the Pakistan Armed Forces, with national morale and determination running high.“The Pakistani nation and the Pakistan Armed Forces know very well how to deal with the enemy,” he said. “We will never let the enemy succeed in its nefarious objectives.”The operation targeted nine locations, including Jaish-e-Mohammed’s base in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba’s hub in Muridke. Utilizing advanced precision weapons and intelligence-based targeting, the Army, Navy, and Air Force coordinated the strikes without engaging Pakistani military sites. The defence ministry called the operation “focused and non-escalatory.” Prime Minister Modi had earlier vowed a strong response to terrorism, granting the military full operational freedom. Operation Sindoor, the Army stated, was India’s answer: “Justice is Served.”","The Indian Armed Forces launched ‘Operation Sindoor’ on Wednesday, targeting terrorist camps in Pakistan.

'Cover fire for terrorists': Indian envoy blasts Irish Times over Pahalgam terror attack editorial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cover-fire-for-terrorists-indian-envoy-blasts-irish-times-over-pahalgam-terror-attack-editorial/articleshow/120938544.cms,"(PTI photo)

Poll Do you agree with the Indian ambassador's criticism of The Irish Times editorial regarding the Pahalgam terror attack? No, I think the editorial was justified. Yes, I support the ambassador's stance.

NEW DELHI: Indian ambassador to Ireland Akhilesh Mishra has issued a strong rebuttal to The Irish Times over its editorial on the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, accusing the publication of downplaying terrorism and echoing narratives that provide ""cover fire"" to its perpetrators.In a post on X, Mishra condemned the editorial for failing to unequivocally denounce the terror attack that killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in Jammu and Kashmir. Instead, he mentioned, it chose to criticise Prime Minister Narendra Modi for “rattling sabres,” and drew an equivalence between India and Pakistan, a country Mishra described as the ""global epicentre of terrorism.""“Our reply to a malicious Irish Times editorial on the terrorist attack in Pahalgam,” India envoy wrote. “Instead of condemning terror and sympathising with innocent victims, it provides cover fire for the terrorists and their sponsors by charging PM Modi of rattling sabres and equating India with Pakistan.”In a letter to the editor, Mishra called the editorial unprofessional and biased, stating that it stood in stark contrast to the support and solidarity expressed by Irish citizens and leaders, including Taoiseach Micheál Martin.He highlighted that while world leaders - including European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen - and institutions like the UN Security Council had condemned the attack in the strongest terms, the editorial omitted these facts and instead questioned India’s response.“The UN Security Council... underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers, and sponsors of this reprehensible act of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice. The Irish Times failed to mention this main operative portion of the UN statement,” Mishra wrote.Refuting the editorial's portrayal of post-2019 Jammu and Kashmir, Indian ambassador Mishra specified that the region has seen major progress since the abrogation of Article 370, with rising investments, a tourism boom, and high voter turnout in the recent Lok Sabha elections.“Contrary to The Irish Times’ misperception… the people have witnessed unprecedented economic and infrastructural development… A democratic government was elected in 2024 with 63.9% turnout,” the letter said.Mishra also pointed to national unity in the aftermath of the attack, saying the entire country, including opposition parties and Kashmiri civil society, was firmly behind the Centre's resolve to act against the perpetrators.The Irish Times editorial, published on April 28, had stated that while Pakistan denied involvement and offered to cooperate with an international investigation, India had not presented evidence beyond historical claims. It accused PM Modi of ""rattling sabres"" and warned against escalation.In response to the April 22 attack, India has taken several strong steps, including suspending long-standing Indus Waters Treaty, in a firm response to Pakistan’s continued support for cross-border terrorism.","Indian ambassador to Ireland Akhilesh Mishra has issued a strong rebuttal to The Irish Times over its editorial on the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam.

NEW DELHI: The United Nations Security Council's closed-door meeting on rising India-Pakistan tensions expectedly failed to yield any substantive outcome for Pakistan.Indian govt sources said Pakistan's efforts to internationalise the issue made little headway as UNSC advised Islamabad to resolve issues bilaterally with India and sought accountability for the Pahalgam attack , while expressing concern over Pakistan's nuclear rhetoric and missile tests.In the 90-minute meeting, the member-states are learnt to have condemned the April 22 attack and posed ""tough questions"" about the likely involvement of UN-proscribed Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba While views were expressed individually by some after the consultations, the Council didn't collectively make any statement. The least Pakistan would have hoped for is an oral statement by the Council president.Former Indian permanent representative to UN Syed Akbaruddin said Pakistan's quest to resurrect an agenda item which has not been deliberated upon formally since 1965 by Council expectedly didn't take off. Pakistan is a non-permanent UNSC member currently.""The lack of a response by the Council to Pakistan's briefing is a vindication of Indian stance,"" said Akbaruddin, who was India's ambassador to the UN when Pakistan last sought closed-door consultations through China in 2019. That was after India revoked J&K's special status in Aug 2019.The 2019 meeting too had ended without any outcome or formal statement even though China had strongly pushed for it. Closed-door meetings comprise informal discussions that are held not in Council room but in an adjacent chamber with limited number of delegates.For Pakistan, as in 2019, the latest meeting too was more an exercise in managing public perception than advancing any meaningful discussions, even though the consultations were held under the India-Pakistan Question that relates to J&K and not under, as it was meant to be initially, the generic 'Threats to International Peace and Security' agenda item.In the meeting, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, members disapproved of false flag narrative initially propounded by Pakistan and asked about the likely involvement of LeT in the attack. There were questions about targeting of tourists based on their religious identity. ""There was condemnation of the attack and recognition of the need for accountability. Some members specifically brought up the targeting of tourists on basis of their religious faith,"" said a source, adding many members expressed concern that Pakistan's missile tests and nuclear rhetoric were escalatory factors.Before the meeting, some Council members were reported to have backed the idea of an independent international investigation into the attack. According to the Security Council Report, China and Greece appeared to have already indicated - before the meeting - their support for such an investigation. Such a probe though will need the consent of both India and Pakistan.Pakistan issued a statement after the meet in which it said Council members expressed ""deep concern"" over the risk of escalation and urged restraint. It also claimed several members underscored that the J&K dispute remained the root cause of regional instability.",Indian govt sources said Pakistan's efforts to internationalise the issue made little headway.

Friedrich Merz elected German chancellor hours after first-round defeat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/friedrich-merz-elected-german-chancellor-hours-after-first-round-defeat/articleshow/120936492.cms,"Poll Do you believe the initial failure in the first ballot will affect Merz's leadership? Yes, it will create doubt. No, people will forget it.

What if Merz had lost?





Friedrich Merz was elected as Germany ’s new chancellor on Tuesday after winning the second round of voting, just hours after his unprecedented failure to secure a majority in the first ballot.His initial defeat was historic, marking the first time in post-war Germany that a chancellor candidate failed to win in the first round. The conservative leader had been widely expected to win smoothly and become Germany’s 10th chancellor since World War II.In the second round, Merz got 325 votes out of 630, enough to win a clear majority, while 289 voted against him.Despite the initial setback, analysts still believed Merz would become chancellor. “Merz will most likely still be elected as chancellor in the end,” said Holger Schmieding of Berenberg Bank. “But even so, the unprecedented failure to be elected in the first round would still be a bad start for him.”After Merz's defeat in the first ballot, AfD co-leader Alice Weidel said, “Merz should step aside and the way should be cleared for a general election,” calling the failed vote a “good day for Germany.”The 69-year-old conservative leader now takes the helm of a coalition between his CDU/CSU alliance and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) of the outgoing Chancellor, Olaf Scholz EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said she would work with Merz for a 'strong' Europe.Ukrainian President Zelenskyy congratulated the newly elected chancellor and said that he hopes for 'more German leadership' in the West under Merz.Had Friedrich Merz lost the second-round election for Chancellor, the Bundestag (German parliament) would have had 14 days to elect a candidate with an absolute majority. During this period, Merz could have run again, but other lawmakers could also have put themselves forward. There is no limit to the number of votes that could take place within these two weeks. If no candidate had secured a majority, Germany’s president could have appointed the candidate with the most votes as Chancellor or dissolved the Bundestag, leading to a new national election.Merz's biographer, Volker Resing, mentioned that if Merz won the second round, people would likely forget the first-round setback. However, Alice Weidel, co-leader of the far-right AfD party, criticised Merz's failure, saying it showed that his coalition had a ""weak foundation"". Despite the AfD’s strong showing in February’s elections, they were excluded from coalition talks due to the long-standing ""firewall"" against far-right cooperation in German politics.Also read: Who is Friedrich Merz?

NEW DELHI: A school in Madhya Pradesh turned into a scene of chaos after a heated argument between the principal and the librarian exploded into a physical fight- with slapping, hair-pulling, and smashed phones - all captured on camera.The video of the incident that occured last week, now viral on social media, shows the two women clashing inside the premises of Eklavya Adarsh Awasiya Vidyalaya in Khargone, about 300 kilometres from Bhopal.In the footage, librarian identified as Madhu Rani is seen arguing with principal Praveen Dahiya over the division of duties. The situation escalates rapidly when Dahiya slaps the librarian, grabs her phone, and smashes it on the ground.“Madam, how dare you? Aap ne mujhe thappad kaise maara? Aap ki himmat kaise hui? (how did you slap me? How dare you) ” Rani shouts, accusing the principal of breaking her phone. However, Dahiya is seen picking it up and throwing it again.The principal then begins recording on her own phone, prompting the librarian to slap her back. What follows is a full-blown altercation - the two women pull each other’s hair and trade blows. “How dare you touch me?” yells the librarian, while the principal repeatedly claims she acted in “self-defense.”In the background, a young boy - reportedly the principal’s son - pleads, “Mumma, rehne do (Mom, let it be),” but no one intervenes until a woman finally steps in and asks them to stop.The video went viral on social media with some users calling for action from women's right and child welfare commissions while some praised the lady who tried to intervene.District authorities took action soon after the incident. Khargone’s tribal welfare department assistant commissioner Prashant Arya said both women were removed from their positions and attached to his office. A departmental inquiry has been ordered, and police action will follow based on its findings.According to police, the fight reportedly began over a dispute involving the distribution of books to students. Both women later approached the Mengaon police station to file complaints against each other, and were subsequently admitted to the district hospital.Read more: MP govt school principal & teacher removed after fight over division of work on campus","A school in Madhya Pradesh turned into a scene of chaos after a heated argument between the principal and the librarian exploded into a physical fight.

AP/PTI

Trump’s pre-meeting insults set the tone







In a tense but candid first meeting at the White House, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly rejected President Donald Trump’s longstanding notion that Canada could become the 51st US state, declaring, “Canada is not for sale. ”Trump, unfazed, responded with a smirk: “Only time will tell.”The exchange came during a private Oval Office meeting followed by a working lunch, where the two leaders discussed strained trade relations, ongoing US tariffs on Canadian goods, and growing calls within Canada to reduce economic dependence on its southern neighbor.Trump later said, “It would be a wonderful marriage, Canada and the United States. Think of the possibilities,” before adding, “We’ll go over some tough points. I’d love a new trade deal. We’ll make a very, very big announcement before my trip to the Middle East.”Carney, elected last month on a platform to stand up to Trump's economic aggression, remained composed but resolute. “We’re here to protect Canadian jobs, Canadian sovereignty, and Canadian values,” he said. “That starts with drawing clear lines, Canada is not for sale, and it never will be.”Hours before Carney’s arrival, Trump soured the diplomatic mood by launching into an online tirade on Truth Social, “We don’t need their Cars, we don’t need their Energy, we don’t need their Lumber, we don’t need ANYTHING they have, other than their friendship…”He accused Canada of being a drain on the US economy, falsely claiming that America subsidizes its neighbor by $200 billion annually and provides “FREE Military Protection.”He questioned why the US should continue any trade at all.Such rhetoric is not new, Trump has often floated the idea of absorbing Canada, once calling the border an “artificial line” that splits what he described as a “beautiful country.” He has imposed tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, and other goods, calling Canada a “socialist regime feeding off America.”Carney’s camp made clear ahead of the visit that the prime minister expected “difficult but constructive” talks. However, the atmosphere remained clouded by Trump’s threats, with Canadian officials warning that no breakthroughs should be expected unless the US rolls back its hostile stance.","Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney rejected President Donald Trump's longstanding notion that Canada could become the 51st US state.

Accusing BJP of triggering the communal strife, the CM also asked “mothers and sisters” to form the bulwark against riots and rioters.“If you promise you will not participate in riots, whatever the provocation, then Didi will always be with you. But if you do, even if everyone else stays with you, Didi will not,” Banerjee said at a public distribution programme in Suti. Shortly before the event, she had met families affected by violence at the Shamsherganj BDO office.In an emotional appeal, Banerjee said, “Do not divide people on the basis of religion. If you do so, remove my heart first. I do not want to witness riots. I am against riots. The rioters were brought to the state from outside so that you fall for their provocation.” She went on to remind people that Murshidabad had not allowed riots even when the Babri Masjid was demolished in 1992.She added, “I follow only one religion, that is humanity. Maa-Mati-Manush is my gotra. I mention it whenever I offer puja. Even at Jagannath Dham, when I was asked about my gotra, I said Maa-Mati-Manush. I want blessings from temples, mosque, and churches to reach everyone. I love all religions.”Exhorting people to rise up again violence, the CM said, “Speak up, mothers, sisters, farmers and students. Say, we will not allow riots. Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians must live together as brothers.”Remember that when you donate blood, it reaches the blood bank without any label. Thus, a Hindu’s blood can save a Muslim and a Muslim’s blood can save a Christian. Blood should be used to save lives, not to spill,” she said, raising a slogan, “Danga noye, shanti chai. Dhongsho noye sristi chai (We want peace not conflict , creation not destruction).The amended waqf law that led to the violence in Shamsherganj and Suti, figured twice in Banerjee’s speech.“The Centre makes law, we do not have a hand in it. Despite our opposition, they went ahead with it. But as long as I am with you in Bengal, neither Hindu nor Muslim nor Sikh nor Christian nor farmer nor worker nor brother nor sister will be harmed.

US President Donald Trump lashed out at New York Attorney General Letitia James on Tuesday, calling her “a total crook” after the justice department received a criminal referral accusing the Democrat of mortgage fraud Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump claimed James was “a disaster for New York” and “a horrible, horrible human being,” adding, “I think she’s a total crook, there’s no question about it — but that’s just my opinion,” as quoted by theHe insisted that US attorney general Pam Bondi would “do what’s right” with the referral, though he distanced himself from the decision. “Pam’s gonna have to do what she wants... She always does. I’ve known her a long time.”Trump’s remarks came shortly after Bondi declined to confirm whether her office would act on the April 14 criminal referral sent by federal housing finance agency director William Pulte. “We don’t discuss anything pending or not within my office,” she told reporters.Pulte’s letter alleges James falsified financial documents to secure more favourable mortgage terms.According to the referral, James allegedly misrepresented a Norfolk, Virginia home as her primary residence despite listing her New York address elsewhere, a tactic that would reduce her interest rate. She also allegedly listed a five-unit Brooklyn building she owns as having only four units, a move that would qualify the property for more favourable government-backed loan terms.“Primary residence mortgages receive more favourable loan terms,” Pulte wrote, adding that multifamily buildings with more than four units face higher interest rates and stricter requirements.James has denied any wrongdoing. Her personal attorney, Abbe Lowell, told Bondi in an April 24 letter that James’ niece was intended to live in the Norfolk home, and that the “mistaken” filing shouldn’t be seen as fraud.Regarding the Brooklyn property, Lowell argued that it has functioned as a four-unit residence since James purchased it in 2001, and its basement has remained unoccupied.A spokesperson for James also dismissed Trump’s attacks and said, “AG James is focused every single day on protecting New Yorkers and upholding the law – not personal attacks, no matter who they come from,”reported.James famously led the 2023 civil fraud case against Trump, which concluded with a $364 million judgment against him and a combined $8 million penalty against his sons Eric and Donald Jr.As of last month, that figure had grown to over $500 million due to interest, as Trump appeals the ruling.As per the, the White House confirmed that no charges have been filed against James yet, but acknowledged further action could follow if the Justice Department proceeds.James’ office, meanwhile, has accused the Trump administration of using federal power for political revenge. “She will not be intimidated by bullies — no matter who they are,” a spokesperson was quoted by","US President Donald Trump lashed out at New York Attorney General Letitia James on Tuesday, calling her “a total crook” after the justice department received a criminal referral accusing the Democrat of mortgage fraud.

Trump says the US will stop bombing Yemen's Houthis after rebels say they'll stop targeting ships,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-says-the-us-will-stop-bombing-yemens-houthis-after-rebels-say-theyll-stop-targeting-ships/articleshow/120948284.cms,"Trump says US to stop strikes on Houthis in Yemen (Image credits: AP)





WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he's ordering a halt to nearly two months of US airstrikes on Yemen's Houthis, saying the Iran-backed rebels have indicated that ""they don't want to fight anymore"" and have pledged to stop attacking ships along a vital global trade route.""We're going to stop the bombing of the Houthis, effective immediately,"" Trump said at the start of his Oval Office meeting with Canadian prime minister Mark Carney.Trump said the Houthis had indicated to US officials that ""they don't want to fight anymore. They just don't want to fight. And we will honor that, and we will stop the bombings.""That likely means an abrupt end to a campaign of airstrikes that began in March, when Trump promised to use ""overwhelming lethal force"" after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing off Yemen in response to Israel's mounting another blockade on the Gaza Strip.At the time, they described the warning as affecting the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea.Trump's announcement came the same day that Israel's military launched airstrikes against the Houthis that it said fully disabled the international airport in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa. Israel's attacks were its second round of airstrikes on targets in Yemen in retaliation for a Houthi missile strike Sunday on Israel's international airport.A US official said the administration had not notified Israel of the agreement with the Houthis before Trump's announcement.Israel, according to this official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic talks, was irked by the unexpected news, particularly because the Houthis have continued to launch attacks on Israel proper and other Israeli targets.Israel does not appear to be covered by the US-Houthi agreement.Trump said the Houthis had ""capitulated but, more importantly, we will take their word that they say they will not be blowing up ships anymore. And that's what the purpose of what we were doing,"" Trump said.""I think that's very positive,"" Trump added. ""They were knocking out a lot of ships.""Asked how the Houthis had communicated that they were looking to stop being targeted by US bombs, Trump offered few details, saying only with a chuckle that the information came from a ""very good source.""A short time later, Omani foreign minister Badr al-Busaidi, confirmed that the US bombing campaign was ending, posting on X that discussions involving the US and Oman, as well as negotiators in Yemen, ""have resulted in a ceasefire agreement between the two sides.""""In the future, neither side will target the other, including American vessels, in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait, ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping,"" he wrote, calling the agreement a ""welcome outcome.""Defense secretary Pete Hegseth said on social media that Trump's ""objective from Day One: 'ensuring freedom of navigation.' PEACE THRU STRENGTH in action.""Despite Trump's framing of the deal as a way to reopen the Red Sea to commercial shipping without fear of Houthi attack, ""the Houthis have not fired on a commercial ship since December,"" Gregory Brew, a senior analyst with the Eurasia Group risk-analysis firm, said on X.""They are likely, however, to continue shooting at Israel,"" Brew noted.The Houthis had been waging persistent missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group's leadership has described as an effort to end Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.From November 2023 until January 2025, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.The Houthis paused attacks in a self-imposed ceasefire until the US launched a broad assault against the rebels in mid-March.Those strikes Trump had ordered were similar to ones carried out against the Houthis multiple times by the administration of his predecessor, democratic president Joe Biden.The Trump-ordered airstrikes gained a higher profile in the public consciousness when The Atlantic revealed that Hegseth had texted sensitive plans for a military strike against the Houthis on a group chat in the messaging app Signal that mistakenly included the magazine's editor-in-chief.Trump stood by Hegseth and downplayed the breach as a ""glitch."" But national security adviser Mike Waltz, who created the group chat on Signal, left his post last week and has been nominated by Trump to be the US ambassador to the United Nations.","President Donald Trump says he's ordering a halt to nearly two months of US airstrikes on Yemen's Houthis.

Two Indian children missing as migrant boat capsizes in California leaving 3 dead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/two-indian-children-missing-as-boat-accident-leaves-three-dead-near-san-diego/articleshow/120914888.cms,"



A small boat believed to be carrying migrants capsized off the coast of San Diego on Monday morning, leaving three people dead, four injured, and seven missing. The US Coast Guard responded promptly, deploying a helicopter and boat to search for the missing individuals. Among the affected individuals is an Indian family, with two children still unaccounted for, while the parents are receiving medical treatment at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla.The Consulate General of India in San Francisco has expressed their sorrow over the tragedy and is providing assistance to the family in coordination with local authorities.The incident occurred about 35 miles north of the Mexico border near Torrey Pines State Beach, shortly after sunrise. The boat, a panga—an open fishing vessel commonly used by smugglers—flipped in the ocean, according to US Coast Guard Petty Officer Chris Sappey. Authorities believe the passengers were migrants, noting that such vessels are often used to evade heavily patrolled land borders. Migrants frequently rely on smugglers to navigate the dangerous seas in an effort to avoid detection.The injured were taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, where they are being treated for respiratory issues.Among the injured are three adults in their 30s and one teenager. The hospital did not provide further details on their conditions. Winds in the area were light, with waves reaching approximately six feet, making the conditions hazardous but not extreme.Hikers at Torrey Pines State Beach reported seeing the boat capsize at around 6.30am (local time). A doctor hiking nearby rushed to the scene, offering assistance and performing CPR on the victims. The search continues for the remaining missing individuals, while authorities investigate the cause of the tragedy.This incident is another in a series of deadly maritime smuggling cases along the US West Coast. In 2023, eight people died when a migrant smuggling boat capsized near San Diego, one of the deadliest such incidents in recent history. Last year, the UN reported a record high number of fatalities among migrants attempting to cross borders, with nearly 9,000 people losing their lives worldwide.","A small boat believed to be carrying migrants capsized off the coast of San Diego on Monday morning, leaving three people dead, four injured, and seven missing.

US secretary of state Marco Rubio after India's Operation Sindoor on Pakistan, said that he is closely monitoring the unfolding situation between the nuclear-armed nations, expressing hope for a swift de-escalation and reaffirming Washington’s commitment to promoting peace in the region.Posting on social media platform X, Rubio said, “I am monitoring the situation between India and Pakistan closely. I echo @POTUS’s comments earlier today that this hopefully ends quickly and will continue to engage both Indian and Pakistani leadership towards a peaceful resolution.”Rubio’s remarks followed India’s launch of Operation Sindoor, a targeted military campaign against terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir. The action was in retaliation for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, which killed 26 civilians—including one Nepali national.According to a statement from the Indian embassy in Washington, “India’s actions have been focused and precise. They were measured, responsible and designed to be non-escalatory in nature. No Pakistani civilian, economic or military targets have been hit. Only known terror camps were targeted.”The embassy also confirmed that NSA Ajit Doval had briefed Rubio on the operation shortly after the strikes.The US has urged restraint from both sides. US President Donald Trump, responding to the situation, told reporters, “It’s a shame. We just heard about it as we were walking in the doors of the Oval. Just heard about it... I hope it ends very quickly.” He noted that tensions between the two nations have persisted for “many, many decades… centuries, actually”.Rubio had earlier spoken to both Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif following the Pahalgam attack .

Pete Hegseth orders 20% cut in senior generals across the Pentagon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hegseth-orders-20-cut-in-senior-generals-across-the-pentagon/articleshow/120914638.cms,"



US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced a 20% cut to the number of four-star generals and admirals across all military branches. The move, which applies across all military branches, comes amid wider efforts to reduce the federal government’s size and restructure its leadership along ideological lines.The directive, revealed in a memo signed by Hegseth, also calls for a 20% cut to top-ranking officers in the National Guard and an overall 10% reduction in general and flag officers across the military. These cuts follow a wave of firings in recent months, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. CQ Brown Jr., and the only two women serving as four-star officers. Hegseth defended the firings as necessary to align military leadership with the administration’s national security agenda The Pentagon has about 900 general and flag officers, with just 44 holding four-star rank. Congress was not given advance notification of the cuts, raising further concern. Representative Seth Moulton, a Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee and a former Marine, accused the administration of deliberately trying to politicise the military, warning it could erode confidence in the chain of command.Hegseth has been vocal in his disdain for what he calls the military’s “social justice agenda,” including diversity and inclusion efforts, transgender service policies, and climate programmes.In recent podcasts, he accused senior officers of catering to ideological trends in Washington and vowed to dismantle what he sees as “redundant bureaucratic layers.”The cuts come alongside a broader overhaul of the defence establishment. Last week, Hegseth ordered the Army to eliminate outdated equipment, shut down headquarters, and reassign thousands of Pentagon staff to frontline units. A military parade to mark Trump’s birthday and the Army’s 250th anniversary is also being planned, reportedly at significant expense.Meanwhile, intelligence agencies are facing similar downsizing. Around 1,200 CIA positions are being cut, largely through early retirements. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, led by Tulsi Gabbard, has already reduced staff by 25%.",Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced a 20% cut to the number of four- star generals and admirals across all military branches.

'Genocidal language': JD Vance blasts Ilhan Omar's call to 'profile white men',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/genocidal-language-jd-vance-blasts-ilhan-omars-call-to-profile-white-men/articleshow/120915138.cms,"



Vice President JD Vance sharply condemned Congresswoman Ilhan Omar ’s remarks calling for the profiling and monitoring of white men in the United States, labelling them as “genocidal language.” The controversy stems from a resurfaced 2018 interview in which Omar suggested that the US should be more focused on the threat posed by white men, arguing that they were responsible for the majority of deaths in the country.Omar, speaking to journalist Mehdi Hasan, explained her stance on national security, saying: “I would say our country should be more fearful of white men across our country because they are actually causing most of the deaths within this country.” She continued, “And so if fear was the driving force of policies to keep America safe, Americans safe inside of this country, we should be profiling, monitoring, and creating policies to fight the radicalisation of white men. ”Vance, did not hold back in his condemnation. He referred to Omar’s comments as “genocidal language,” adding, “What a disgrace this person is.”In response, Omar pushed back, defending her remarks in a statement. She clarified, “In this nearly 8-year-old clip, I am referring to the rise of white nationalism in an annual report issued by the Anti-Defamation League that said white supremacists were responsible for 78 percent of ‘extremist-related murders.’”Omar also took the opportunity to challenge Vance’s use of the term “genocidal,” suggesting he should “look up what ‘genocidal’ actually means when you’re actively supporting a genocide taking place in Gaza. ”This comment, which resurfaced when conservative activist Laura Loomer shared the video again, reignited the debate over Omar’s views. Loomer, who has previously criticised Omar for her alleged ties to extremist groups, posted the video with the caption: “Ilhan Omar, a jihadist member of Congress who has documented ties to HAMAS, the Muslim Brotherhood and ISIS, says jihadists aren’t a threat and we should instead be creating policies and databases here in the US to ‘profile white men,’ who she says are the biggest terror threat.”This controversy comes on the heels of a separate incident where Omar found herself under fire for an expletive-laden response to a reporter. When asked about a controversial deportee, Omar angrily told the journalist, “I think you should f**k off,” before later defending the exchange online.","Congresswoman Ilhan Omar called for the profiling and monitoring of white men in the United States.

Who is the 'owner of Canada'? Did Mark Carney stutter?

Mark Carney's expressions viral







The meeting between President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the White House was the most anticipated amid the ongoing US-Canada strife and Trump's dogged persistence to make Canada the 51st state of the US. Mark Carney was stern in delivering the message that Canada is not up for sale, but Trump added 'never say never' with a mischievous smile on his face.Social media went berserk over their conversation as MAGA commentators claimed that Carney was stuttering showing signs of panic, when he said that Canada was not up for sale. Canadian social media users pushed back and said he was not stuttering but was just speaking respectfully without being ""unnecessarily aggressive"".Carney told Trump that there are some places that are never for sale. And he gave the example of the White House, the Buckingham Palace. ""As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale,"" Carney said. ""We're sitting in one right now, Buckingham Palace that you visited, as well. And having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign the last several months, it's not for sale, it won't be for sale, ever.But the opportunity is in the partnership and what we can build together.""Social media users wondered what he meant by the owners of Canada and who are the owners of Canada. While he probably meant the people of Canada whom he met during the election campaigning and who are against dead against merging with the US, Canada js a constitutional monarchy and their head of state is King Charles III.Several expressions of Carney from the meeting went viral and Canadians praised how much restraint he showed when Trump went on 'lying'. ""Mark Carney’s brain just rebooted on live tv after Trump’s stupid comment that we don't do much business with Canada. Canada is the largest importer of U.S. goods.

Past criminal record of Mahendra Patel







After spending 49 days at the Cobb County Jail in Georgia, Indian-origin engineer Mahendra Patel was granted a $10,000 bond on Tuesday in the high-profile Walmart 'attempt to kidnap' case in which Patel was 'wrongly' arrested and incarcerated.On March 18, Mahendra Patel went to the Cobb County Walmart looking for Tylenol medicine for his mother. He asked a woman, Caroline Miller, for help. Miller was on a motorized cart with her two children. When Miller showed him the direction where he would find his medicine, Patel grabbed her two-year-old son in an attempt to kidnap him; Miller accused. But Patel said he was just making sure that the child did not fall. Patel was arrested after Miller lodged a complaint and was behind bars, but his attorney recently released surveillance footage showing that there was no force, no tug-of-war between them over the kid.The prosecution on Tuesday opposed to Patel's release citing his previous arrests for fraud and DUI. “To clarify, the defendant is not entitled to bond as a matter of right. It is entirely at the court’s discretion whether to grant bond,” assistant district attorney Jason Evans said. “However, the court is not required to grant it, and the defendant’s bond status was initially set at ‘no bond” by a magistrate judge based on the sufficiency of the evidence at the warrant stage.” The prosecution argued that Patel was previously convicted of conspiracy to defraud the US and served federal prison time, apart from being charged for reckless driving.Judge Murphy ruled that Patel would be granted bond and he was not a flight risk or a danger to the community. He also did not have history of sexual assault, the judge added and referred to the surveillance footage that he did not flee Walmart and was not running away.As part of the bond conditions, Patel is not allowed to use drugs or alcohol and cannot contact the alleged victim or her family, or visit Walmart.","Mahendra Patel, an Indian-origin engineer, has been granted bail in a high- profile 'attempt to kidnap' case in Georgia.

Major win for Trump crackdown: Lady Gaga bomb suspect was deported from US last month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/major-win-for-trump-crackdown-lady-gaga-bomb-suspect-was-deported-from-us-last-month/articleshow/120940019.cms,"Lady Gaga bomb suspect was deported from the US to Brazil last month.

Da Silva was going to perform a Satanist ritual







The suspected terrorist who allegedly planned to attack Lady Gaga 's record-breaking concert in Brazil has been identified as Luis da Silva , a 44-year-old man, who was deported from the US last month. Silva wanted to live stream the execution of children and set up bombs close to the stage during Gaga's Saturday performance on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro.Da Silva was taken into custody just hours before the concert along with a 17-year-old boy. They allegedly used Discord to plan their attack, and try radicalize others including teenagers to carry out attacks. Brazillian authorities said they planned to use Molotov cocktails and explosive backpacks.“Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks. Her team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place.”Da Silva told police that Lady Gaga is a Satanist and so he was going to perform a Satanist ritual by killing a child during the show. Da Silva was arrested on an illegal gun possession charge but was released on bail Monday.His teen accomplice was arrested for possession of child pornography in Rio de Janeiro.“It was an integrated action that saved hundreds of lives. These groups, which are organized, have goals to achieve notoriety, to gather more spectators, more participants, the majority of whom are teenagers, many of them children,” Rio de Janeiro Civil Police Chief Luiz Lima, who oversees the Department for the Repression of Computer Crimes, told reporters.The revelation that the man was deported from the US comes as a massive victory for the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigrants, which came on the radar as several lawsuits have been filed against deportations, claiming that the Trump administration deported many innocent people, calling them gangsters. Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador as the Trump administration called him a member of the MS-13 gang but the Supreme Court ordered to bring him back to the US.","Luis da Silva, a 44-year-old man, was deported from the US last month.

Gaza, Israel, and a possible deal?

Business and geopolitics







US President Donald Trump on Tuesday sparked speculation by promising a major announcement ahead of his upcoming Middle East trip , calling it “as big as it gets” but refusing to share any specifics.“We're going to have a very, very big announcement to make. Like, as big as it gets, and I won't tell you on what. And it's very positive,” Trump said in the Oval Office during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.“It'll be one of the most important announcements that have been made in years about a certain subject,” he added, offering no clues as to the content. Carney, seated beside him, responded with a dry quip: “I'm on the edge of my seat.”The statement came just days before Trump is scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates — his first major foreign trip of the term, following a brief stop in Rome earlier this year for the funeral of Pope Francis.Diplomatic sources suggest the US hopes to make progress on the situation in Gaza ahead of the trip. Israel’s ongoing siege and bombardment of the territory, now in its second month, has cut off food and essential supplies, raising concerns about humanitarian collapse.Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on Tuesday said Gaza “will be entirely destroyed,” reiterating plans to forcibly displace much of the population following Hamas’s October 2023 attacks.Trump, like his predecessor Joe Biden, has sought a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, but Riyadh has maintained it will not recognize Israel without significant movement toward Palestinian statehood . US officials believe progress on hostage releases and humanitarian access could be key to unlocking talks.Beyond diplomacy, Trump is also expected to pursue major energy and defense deals with the oil-rich Gulf states. The administration has hinted that announcements related to economic cooperation and security alignments could be on the agenda.Qatar, which has served as a critical intermediary in hostage negotiations, has indicated it will continue its mediation efforts, even as talks remain fragile.","US President Donald Trump says he will make a ""very, very big announcement"" about the Middle East.

Days after empty rhetoric that threatened bloodshed if India stopped the Indus waters, Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has struck a more conciliatory note, saying Pakistan seeks peace, not conflict.Speaking in Pakistan’s National Assembly on Tuesday, Bhutto said Pakistan is a victim of terrorism and does not export it, ANI news agency reported quoting Dawn.“If India wishes to walk the path of peace, let them come with open hands and not clenched fists. Let them come with facts and not fabrication. Let us sit as neighbours and speak the truth,” Bhutto said.His remarks mark a stark departure from his earlier outburst in Sukkur, where he lashed out at India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Pahalgam terror attack . At that time, Bhutto had accused PM Modi of making false allegations and said India had no right to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty Standing by the Indus River, he had said, “The Indus is ours and will remain ours. Either water will flow in this Indus, or their blood will.”The April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, which claimed 26 lives, mostly tourists, was carried out by Pakistan-backed terrorists, triggering one of the most serious spikes in India-Pakistan tensions in recent years.","Bilawal Bhutto said Pakistan is a victim of terrorism and does not export it.
