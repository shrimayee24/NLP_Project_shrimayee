NEW DELHI: War of words has erupted between Congress leaders Shashi Tharoor and Udit Raj following Tharoor's comments on the recent Pahalgam terror attack The controversy began when Tharoor supported the central government's position, stating that no nation could guarantee ""100 per cent foolproof intelligence.""Tharoor drew parallels with Israel's intelligence failure during the October 7 attack, suggesting that accountability should be demanded after the crisis is resolved. ""Just as Israel is waiting till the end of the war before they demand accountability, similarly, I think we too should see the present crisis through before demanding accountability from the government,"" Tharoor stated.This stance prompted Udit Raj to question Tharoor's political loyalty, asking whether he was aligned with the Congress or the BJP. Tharoor responded firmly, stating, ""I speak for myself. I am not anyone's spokesperson. I think everybody knows that I am not a BJP spokesperson.""Raj intensified his attack on Tharoor by suggesting that Tharoor's positions might be influenced by fear of central agencies like the ED, CBI, and the Income Tax department. He criticised Tharoor's limited participation in protests and questioned his praise for Prime Minister Modi's diplomatic engagements, particularly regarding the meeting with US President Trump.""Is he scared of ED, CBI and Income Tax? He continually seeks opportunities to defend PM Modi and criticise the Congress party. In how many protests has Shashi Tharoor participated, and how many times has he been arrested?"" Udit Raj questioned.The former BJP MP turned Congress leader also challenged Tharoor's apparent defence of the government, particularly when the administration had acknowledged security lapses in the Pahalgam attack that claimed 26 lives, including a Nepali citizen.Raj argued that as a Congress leader, Tharoor should be demanding stronger action against Pakistan, reminiscent of Congress governments' responses during the 1965 and 1971 wars.","Congress leaders Udit Raj, Shashi Tharoor lock horns over Pahalgam remarks.

NEW DELHI: India on Monday hit out at Pakistan at the United Nations, highlighting Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif's ""open confession"" about his country's role in supporting and training terrorists.Speaking at the UN, India's Deputy Permanent Representative Yojna Patel condemned Pakistan for misusing the international platform to spread propaganda and make unfounded allegations against India. She specifically referenced Asif's televised confession about Pakistan's history of terrorist support.""It is unfortunate that one particular delegation has chosen to misuse and undermine this forum. To indulge in propaganda and make baseless allegations against India. The whole world has heard Pakistan's Defence Minister, Khwaja Asif, admitting and confessing Pakistan's history of supporting, training and funding terrorist organizations in a recent television interview,"" Patel said.""This open confession surprises no one and exposes Pakistan as a rogue state, fueling global terrorism and destabilizing the region. The world can no longer turn a blind eye,"" she added.Also read: Pahalgam massacre: Pakistani terrorist former para commando, says probe Patel highlighted India's status as a victim of cross-border terrorism , noting that the recent Pahalgam attack resulted in the highest civilian casualties since the 2008 Mumbai attacks .

As the UN Security Council in its statement has said, perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of reprehensible acts of terrorism must be held accountable and brought to justice,"" she added.This comes days after Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif admitted on Sky News that Pakistan harbours and funds terror organisations, saying that it has been “doing the West’s dirty work for decades”. He also said the Pakistan-based terror groups are “not multiple organisations” but “one single organisation religiously organised with different faces”.He said terror groups in Pakistan were “used as proxies by the USA”, and earlier the same terror groups had been treated like VIPs in Washington. “When we were fighting the war on their side in the ’80s against the Soviet Union, all these terrorists of today, they were wining and dining in Washington. Then came 9/11. Again the same situation was created. I think our government then made a mistake.Asif also said that his country would respond “in kind” to any attack by nuclear rival New Delhi in retaliation for Pahalgam and called on US President Donald Trump to “bring sanity to the situation”.After the Pahalgam attack claiming 26 lives, the government implemented several diplomatic responses, including shutting down the Attari ICP, cancelling the SVES for Pakistani nationals with a 40-hour departure notice, and reducing diplomatic staff at both High Commissions.","India hit out at Pakistan at the United Nations, highlighting Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif's ""open confession"" about his country's role in supporting and training terrorists.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has said that 'Court of Kazi', 'Court of (Darul Kaja) Kajiyat' and 'Sharia Court' have no legal status or recognition in law and any declaration by them, including fatwa issued by them, is not binding on anyone and is unenforceable.A bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and Ahsanuddin Amanullah said SC's verdict in 2014 settled the issue of legal status of Sharia courts and reiterated its findings while allowing the maintenance plea of a Muslim woman who is living separately from her husband who invoked 'Court of (Darul Kaja) Kajiyat' to get a talaqnama .""Court of Kazi, Court of (Darul Kaja) Kajiyat, Sharia Court, etc, by whatever name styled have no recognition in law. As noted in Vishwa Lochan Madan (case), any declaration/decision by such bodies, by whatever name labelled, is not binding on anyone and is unenforceable by resort to any coercive measure. The only way such declaration/decision can withstand scrutiny in the eye of law could be when the affected parties accept such declaration/decision by acting thereon or accepting it and when such action does not conflict with any other law. Even then, such declaration/decision, at best, would only be valid inter-se the parties that choose to act upon/accept the same, and not a third party,"" the bench said.In this case, the wife had invoked the family court's jurisdiction to get maintenance which was denied on the ground that it was the second marriage of both husband and wife and she was herself responsible for living separately.Quashing the orders of the family court and Allahabad HC which, too, rejected the maintenance plea, SC said court was not an institution to sermonise society on morality and ethics. Interestingly, the state govt also opposed her plea of maintenance. ""In her application for maintenance filed under Section 125 of Criminal Procedure Code, the appellant contended that respondent No.2 (husband) had caused cruelty to her as she was not able to fulfil his demand for a motorcycle and Rs 50,000. On this aspect, the family court noted that since it was their second marriage, there is no possibility of demand of dowry by him, as he would be trying to rehabilitate his house. Such reasoning/observation by the family court is unknown to the canons of law and is based on mere conjecture and surmise,"" SC said.""The family court will do well, henceforth, to bear in mind the observation in Nagarathinam v State, that the 'court is not an institution to sermonise society on morality and ethics'. The family court could not have presumed that a second marriage for both parties would necessarily entail no dowry demand,"" it said while granting monthly maintenance of Rs 4,000 to the wife.","Court of Kazi, Court of (Darul Kaja) Kajiyat, Sharia Court, etc, by whatever name styled have no recognition in law.

As she was leaving the venue, a gunman fired at her and then detonated a suicide bomb, fatally injuring Bhutto.While the Pakistani government blamed the Pakistani Taliban and militant leader Baitullah Mehsud for the attack, serious suspicions have persisted about the involvement of elements within Pakistan’s military and intelligence services, particularly the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).Zardari, who is a former Pakistani foreign minister, threatened India days after New Delhi formally suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, following the deadly terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam that killed 26 people, mostly tourists.""India has accused Pakistan of the Pahalgam incident, with Modi making false allegations to conceal his own weaknesses and deceive his people. He has unilaterally decided to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, under which India had acknowledged that the Indus belongs to Pakistan. Standing here in Sukkur by the Indus, I want to tell India that the Indus is ours and will remain ours. Either water will flow in this Indus, or their blood will,"" Bhutto, speaking in Sukkur alongside the Indus River, had said.Before Owaisi, Union minister Hardeep Puri had flayed Bhutto, saying the PPP chief needs to get his ""mental condition checked"".“Enough is enough,” Mr. Puri said, warning that India’s patience has worn thin.“Tell him to get his mental condition checked, what kind of statements he is giving... We will no longer tolerate this. Now wait for a few days,” Mr. Puri said, while speaking to news agency ANI.Union minister for commerce Piyush Goyal also slammed Bhutto and expressed confidence that many Pakistani nationals would not even agree with the ex-Pakistan foreign minister's views.""Pakistan is a despondent country and they don’t have any priority apart from spreading terror.

KOLKATA: A Kolkata court acquitted last week a 31-year-old man who spent eight years behind bars for the murder of a friend, sharply criticising police for failing to send key evidence for forensic testing and mishandling the investigation.Kolkata resident Raja Paik , arrested in Sept 2017 for the murder of 24-year-old Chiranjib Gupta in the city, was cleared Thursday by Alipore sessions judge Surajit Mandal.Chiranjib's mother said in the police complaint that her son - a drug addict and habitual drunkard - was found dead with a pillow on his face on the first floor of their two-storey home at Eastend Park in Garfa area when she returned home at 6.30pm after buying medicine for her daughter. Her daughter, returning from school at 3pm, said Chiranjib had opened the door for her.The judge faulted police for not sending the bloodstained pillow and a cotton belt - the alleged murder weapons - for forensic examination .""That aspect creates a doubt with respect to the manner in which the investigation has been handled,"" Mandal said.

Omar: This time no politics, only condemnation & solidarity



JAMMU/SRINAGAR: J&K CM Omar Abdullah choked back tears in a charged assembly session Monday as he vowed not to exploit the Pahalgam terrorist attack that claimed 26 lives to press for restoration of the Union territory's statehood. ""Curse be upon me if I go to Centre and push for statehood at this critical moment,"" he said.His father and National Conference president Farooq Abdullah , speaking to reporters outside the assembly, said Pakistan's actions in Pahalgam had eliminated any possibility for dialogue.Omar said he felt personally responsible for the safety of the tourists, saying he as CM had ""invited"" them to Kashmir . ""I was the host of these people... It was my responsibility to send these people safely, which I was unable to do,"" the CM said.The assembly, in a special session convened at the request of ministers, unanimously passed a resolution condemning the attack and endorsing diplomatic steps taken by the Centre. It appealed to all states and Union territories to ensure the safety and well-being of Kashmiris across India.Visibly emotional as he addressed the session, Omar Abdullah rejected demands from non-BJP members to leverage the April 22 attack for political gain. ""I do not believe in cheap politics,"" he said. ""Should I have no value for the 26 lives lost and go to Centre demanding statehood now? Neither business rules nor any other thing but only remembering the 26 people who died.""The CM stressed that the horror in Pahalgam would not be reduced to a bargaining chip. ""We have talked about statehood in the past and will continue to talk about it, but not right now,"" he said. ""This time there will be no politics - only condemnation, only solidarity.""""I used to support dialogue every time. How will we answer those who died in Pahalgam and those who lost their loved ones? Are we doing justice?"" Farooq asked. ""Not Balakot, today the nation wants such action so that these kinds of attacks never happen.""His voice breaking in the assembly, Omar read out the names and home states of all the victims - 25 tourists and a Kashmiri pony ride operator. ""From north to south and from east to west, the entire country has been engulfed in the attack,"" he said.He recalled past atrocities, including attacks on Amarnath pilgrims, Doda villages, and Sikh communities, and warned that the horror of Baisaran had brought back the bloodshed people thought had ended over 21 years ago.""There were no words when I met the families... the children who saw their fathers in blood... the woman who was married a few days ago,"" the J&K CM said, adding, ""Some of them came to me and said, 'What was our fault? We had come to Kashmir for the first time'.""Omar highlighted spontaneous protests across J&K condemning the attack, calling them a turning point. ""People's outrage against terrorism... this is beginning of its end if we take proper steps,"" the CM said.","J&K CM Omar Abdullah vows not to exploit the Pahalgam terrorist attack that claimed 26 lives.

NEW DELHI: As it looks to mobilise international opinion against Pakistan’s support to cross-border terrorism, the government also briefed the Taliban regime in Afghanistan about the common neighbour’s links with the April 22 Pahalgam attack . According to sources, Taliban’s acting foreign minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi strongly condemned the terrorist attack in a meeting with an Indian delegation headed by MEA joint secretary Anand Prakash, who handles Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran, underscoring the need to punish the perpetrators.The visit by Prakash came in the middle of soaring India-Pakistan tensions over the attack. India’s ties with the Taliban dispensation in Kabul have improved dramatically in the recent past, contrary to the fear in August 2021 - after the Taliban took over Kabul – that the armed militia would act as a proxy government run by the ISI. All this while, Pakistan’s own ties with the Taliban have seen a stead deterioration, mainly because of the activities of Pakistan Taliban (TTP).The Taliban, in fact, had categorically condemned the Pahalgam attack last week too, saying such incidents undermine efforts to ensure regional security and stability. Given the current circumstances, Afghanistan is unlikely to allow Pakistan any “strategic depth” that it has always sought in the country in the event of a military conflict with India.Prakash was in Kabul on Sunday to review progress in bilateral ties and was reported to have conveyed to Muttaqi that India is ready to restart work on its projects in the country and also invest in other infrastructure projects. The Taliban have on several occasions in the past few years assured Indian officials of enough security to allow them to work fearlessly in the country.According to Kabul, the 2 sides discussed bilateral political relations, trade, transit, and recent regional political developments and Muttaqi again underlined the need for normal issuance of Indian visas to Afghan businessmen, patients and students.Muttaqi emphasized the expansion of diplomatic and economic relations between Afghanistan and India and stated that there are currently good opportunities for investment in Afghanistan. He encouraged Indian investors to take advantage of these opportunities and invest in Afghanistan, according to an Afghan readout, while seeking facilitation of movement of people between Afghanistan and India.Prakash, according to Afghanistan, said that India values its relations with Afghanistan and hopes to further expand ties in various areas.“He mentioned that India will continue its cooperation with Afghanistan and wishes to invest in some infrastructure projects, as well as resume work on some projects that have been stalled for some time,” said the readout.“In conclusion, both sides emphasized expanding relations, facilitating the exchange of delegation, easing visa issuance, and strengthening bilateral cooperation,” it added.",Taliban’s acting foreign minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi strongly condemned the terrorist attack in a meeting with an Indian delegation.

AGRA: Vrindavan 's famous Banke Bihari temple has dismissed suggestions from right-wing groups protesting against the Pahalgam attack that Muslims rendering services to the shrine be boycotted.Banke Bihari priest and member of the temple's administration committee, Gyanendra Kishore Goswami said Monday: ""It is not practical. Muslims, particularly artisans and weavers , have deep-rooted contributions here. They've played a major role in weaving the dresses of Banke Bihari for decades.

Yes, those terrorists (in Pahalgam) should be punished severely and we're totally with govt. But in Vrindavan, Hindus and Muslims live together in peace and harmony.""

""They (the protesters) came to my shop and asked us to put the name of the proprietor on the signboard. I've been running this shop for over 20 years. My father worked here as a tailor.

'Not common for rustic people to be aware of mental illness'

NEW DELHI: An anganwadi worker leading a happy family life in a Chhattisgarh village inexplicably bludgeoned her daughters, aged five and three, to death with a crowbar, cried incessantly after the act and claimed she was possessed by ""invisible powers"" at that time.She was convicted by both trial court and HC for murder and given a life term. But a Supreme Court bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and N Kotiswar Singh on Monday found that the intention to murder was completely absent.Justice Singh reasoned that being possessed by 'invisible powers' could be a temporary medical condition and converted her conviction to culpable homicide not amounting to murder . The bench ordered her release on finding that she had been behind bars for nearly 10 years.Referring to her blabbering that ""she is mata, Budhi Dai etc"" 15 days prior to the incident on June 5, 2015, and the fact that she was taken to hospital for consultation with a psychiatrist, Justice Singh said in rural settings, where superstitions run deep and mental problems often get confused with control of 'invisible powers' over a person, it was possible that she had a sudden bout of mental disorder leading to the killings.""If there were no motivating factors at all which impelled her to commit such a gruesome crime in a domestic environment which was otherwise normal in all respects, it is totally inexplicable and incomprehensible how a mother who loves her children and who had cordial relations with her husband could resort to such a violent act and be attributed with the 'intention to cause death' of her beloved children, except for coming under some influence or forces beyond her control as claimed by her,"" the bench said.""It is not common for rustic persons to be aware of various mental disorders/illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, that may temporarily impair the mental condition of an individual. Often, these disorders are unrecognised and remain untreated as it may be difficult to identify the symptoms and they do not seek proper , resulting in such medical/mental conditions which can be misinterpreted or confused with spells or influence of invisible forces based on superstitions,"" it said.","Anganwadi worker bludgeoned her daughters, aged five and three, to death with a crowbar.

It said that due to extreme temperature variations in Spain, there were ""anomalous oscillations"" in very high-voltage lines, which caused synchronisation failures between systems.The outage started around 12:30PM CET (4:00PM IST). As per a statement given by Red Electrica to Bloomberg, the power outage may take up to ten hours to fully restore.“Air traffic in Spain and Portugal is being impacted by widespread electrical outages affecting both countries.

NEW DELHI: A Kerala court on Monday sentenced a man and his mother for starving his wife to death over dowry demands .The 28-year-old victim, identified as Thushara, was reduced to a ""bag of bones"" and died due to starvation. The case, which dates back to 2019, caused significant public outrage in Kerala. The victim was also a mother of two.At the time of her death, Thushara weighed only 20 to 21 kilograms.Thushara suffered horrifying abuse at their home in Karunagappally. Denied proper food, she was forced to survive on soaked rice and sugar syrup before she collapsed and died at a government hospital on 21 March 2019.S Subash, judge of the Additional District and Sessions Court-IV, found husband Chandulal (36) and his mother Geetha (62) guilty and imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh each.Special prosecutor Mahendra K B said the court accepted the prosecution's arguments and convicted the two under Sections 304(B) and 302 of the Indian Penal Code.""This is a case which has no precedence in our country,"" said Advocate Mahendra, speaking to reporters after the verdict. While dowry-related killings have tragically been seen before, he explained this was likely the first instance where a woman was forced to die through starvation.Thushara's torture came to light during a police investigation following her death, leading to the swift arrest of both Chandulal and Geetha.Chanthulal and Geethalal were allegedly practising witchcraft and black magic, and had erected a tin barrier around the compound of the house to keep away from the outside world, said a police officer.Thushara married Chandulal in 2013.

When her family couldn't afford it, Thushara was kept locked in the house, forbidden from meeting her relatives or neighbours. She wasn't even allowed to contact her family by phone. Even after having her second child, her relatives were not allowed to see her. It was only when the Kollam East Police got involved that Thushara's family was allowed to visit her and meet the baby.Rural SP K G Simon, who supervised the investigation said that no one in the neighbourhood had any clue about the severity of the torture","A Kerala court sentenced a man and his mother for starving his wife to death.

Reason why membership is so high



President Donald Trump's eldest son Donald Trump Jr has come up with a new business venture and it is only meant for the super-rich.

Only money won't suffice as the membership is limited only to invitation.Politico, which received an invitation for the launch of the club, reported that the club in called Executive Branch, located in Georgetown. The membership fee per year in $500,000. The club's first official even was an after-party held Saturday night following the White House Correspondents' Dinner which no Trump administration officials attended.People familiar with Don Jr’s plans for the club told Politico that the goal was to create the “highest-end private club” DC has ever seen, and to cater to business and tech moguls looking to cozy up to the Trump administration.The invitation card for the first official event of the Executive Branch kept the location of the party cryptic as it said the location would be provided upon RSVP.Donald Trump Jr is not the only brain behind the super-rich club. Megadonor Omeed Malik, Zach and Alex Witkoff, the sons of Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, are among the co-owners while founding members include Trump's crypto czar David Sacks, the Winklevoss brothers and Chamath Palihapitiya.Per the Politico report, the steep membership fee and the invitation have the purpose of putting wannabes at bay. There should be no press or prying eyes, when the C-suite crowd mingles with Trump advisers and cabinet members.

European Commission Executive Vice President Teresa Ribera, a former Spanish minister, cautioned that no evidence currently points to sabotage or a cyberattack. “We are investigating with utmost caution to determine the specific causes of this incident, one of the most serious in Europe in recent times,” Ribera said.Portuguese Presidency Minister António Leitão Amaro suggested the issue stemmed from a problem in Spain’s power transportation network, though details remain unclear. Spain’s vocal opposition to Israel’s war in Gaza and its support for Ukraine against Russia have made it a prime target for cyberattacks. Spain’s Joint Cyberspace Command and National Cryptologic Center are investigating the outage.Speculation about a cyberattack persists, as power grids connected to the internet are vulnerable to hackers who could remotely manipulate systems and cause widespread chaos. A Prysmian Magazine blog highlighted the devastating impact of such attacks, noting that without electricity, “there would be no light, running water, telephone signal, internet, heating, or air conditioning,” and transportation and communication systems would collapse.","A widespread blackout struck Spain and Portugal on Monday, April 28, disrupting life for 50 million people.

A US F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jet fell into the Red Sea on Monday after slipping off the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier while being towed, the Navy said.The fighter jet slipped off the hangar deck of the USS Harry S Truman as sailors were towing it into the hangar bay, the Navy said. The aircraft, assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron 136 , fell into the Red Sea after the towing crew lost control during the move.""The F/A-18E was actively under tow in the hangar bay when the move crew lost control of the aircraft.

"'It’s the tariffs, stupid’: How Donald Trump won Canada’s election for Mark Carney",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canada-election-results-2025-mark-carney-donald-trump-liberal-party/articleshow/120715196.cms,"Driving the news

Why it matters

The big picture

Until January, the Canadian election looked like a slow-motion trainwreck for the Liberals. Justin Trudeau , burdened by nearly a decade of inflation, housing crises, and scandal, resigned. The Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, were up by twenty points. Then Trump took office again - and declared Canada should become the United States' ""51st state.""

, burdened by nearly a decade of inflation, housing crises, and scandal, resigned. The Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, were up by twenty points. Then Trump took office again - and declared Canada should become the United States' ""51st state."" The insults didn't stop. Trump slapped new tariffs on Canadian goods, froze car manufacturing plants, and flooded social media with threats. By the time Canadians went to the polls, the election was no longer a choice between stagnation and change - it was a fight for national identity.

Trump’s return to the White House unleashed a wave of Canadian patriotism, driving record early voter turnout-7.3 million ballots cast ahead of election day.

Carney, a former governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, ran on his steady-hand economic record and direct warnings about the real threat Trump poses to Canada’s independence and economy.

Conservative leader Poilievre’s Trump-style populism-emphasizing cost of living, crime, and immigration fears-was drowned out by a louder nationalistic call for unity against American pressure.

Trump’s taunts triggered boycotts of American goods, declines in cross-border travel, and a surge in visible nationalism-maple leaf flags adorned cars, storefronts, and “Never 51” T-shirts even in traditionally separatist Quebec.

“The Americans want to break us so they can own us,” Carney warned days before the vote.

Even on election day, Trump posted again on social media suggesting Canada should join the US, claiming, ""It makes no sense unless Canada is a State!""

What they are saying

At the ground level, the Trump effect was visceral. Many Canadians didn’t just dislike Trump-they saw him as an existential threat.

Reid Warren, a voter in Toronto, said he backed Carney's Liberals because Poilievre “sounds like mini-Trump to me.”

“Canadians coming together from all the shade being thrown from the States is great, but it’s definitely created some turmoil, that’s for sure,” Warren added.

As per a Politico report, Doug Ford, Ontario’s conservative Premier, tried to warn Poilievre months ago. His blunt advice echoed James Carville’s 1992 mantra: “It’s the tariffs, stupid,” Ford said.

But Poilievre never pivoted, maintaining a domestic-focused, Trump-adjacent message that increasingly alienated centrist and moderate voters.

Dan Moulton, a Liberal strategist, said it plainly: “The reason our third- and fourth parties weakened is because voters from those parties are rushing to the Liberals to stop Pierre.”

Between the lines

Trump didn’t just fuel Liberal momentum-he forced a seismic shift in Canada’s political dynamics:

The New Democratic Party (NDP) and Bloc Québécois, once essential players in Canada’s fragmented parliamentary system, were sidelined as voters rushed to larger parties.

A once multi-party election effectively became a two-party tribal contest-a rare phenomenon in Canadian politics.

And Carney, once viewed as a technocratic outsider, morphed into “Captain Canada,” a symbol of national defense against American encroachment.

At a rally, one woman even interrupted Carney’s remarks to shout: “Lead us, big daddy!”

In another twist of irony, it was Trump-the figure most associated with smashing global alliances-who pushed Canadians toward embracing a traditional collective identity anchored in independence, solidarity, and resistance.

A global pattern: Trump, the unexpected midwife of the Left

What’s next

Uniting a fractured Canada: Western provinces like Alberta and Saskatchewan, furious at another Liberal victory, are flirting with secessionist sentiment. Carney must quickly show western Canadians they are heard-or risk deepening national fractures.

Managing Trump: Canada’s $450 billion in exports to the US are under siege. Trump’s threats of auto tariffs and steel sanctions could hammer Canadian industries like manufacturing, energy, and agriculture.

Calming the US-Canada relationship: Trump’s talk of ""acquiring"" Canada has fundamentally altered perceptions. As Chrystia Freeland, a former finance minister, put it:

“One of the big projects is figuring out how does global security work when the US is not the guarantor of the free world.”

To keep relations stable, suggestions are already floating that Carney appoint a conservative ambassador, like Jean Charest, to Washington.

Economic resilience: Carney promised that every dollar collected from counter-tariffs would go back into supporting Canadian workers hit by the trade war. But broader structural challenges-high housing costs, inflation, and supply chain disruptions-remain acute.

Bottom line

In an election that was supposed to be a referendum on a tired Liberal dynasty, but it was US President Donald Trump - not Mark Carney - who turned the tide.Prime Minister Mark Carney’s Liberal Party pulled off a historic comeback, winning Canada's federal election Monday, fueled not by promises about domestic reforms-but by US President Donald Trump's tariff threats and sovereignty insults.The Liberals, written off months ago, surged back by positioning themselves as the bulwark against Trump’s economic aggression, nationalist rhetoric, and annexation threats that angered Canadians from coast to coast.“We were dead and buried in December. Now we are going to form a government,” David Lametti, a former Liberal Justice Minister, told CTV.As per the latest trends, Liberals were projected to win the most seats in Parliament, although it remains unclear whether they will govern with a majority or need support from smaller parties.This result marks the Liberals' fourth straight term and underscores how foreign policy-especially perceived threats to Canadian sovereignty-can dramatically reshape domestic politics.The left coalesced around the Liberals at a scale not seen in half a century, while Trump’s tariffs and casual talk of turning Canada into the 51st US state obliterated Pierre Poilievre’s Conservative momentum.Historian Robert Bothwell didn’t mince words: “The Liberals ought to pay him. Trump talking is not good for the Conservatives.”The moment echoes the 1988 Canadian election, when free trade with the US became the central issue-but this time it’s about keeping distance, not integration.The shock in Canada mirrors a broader phenomenon across the Anglosphere. As per a report in the Economist, Trump's tariffs and foreign policy chaos have inadvertently lifted struggling center-left leaders elsewhere - Anthony Albanese in Australia, Keir Starmer in Britain. A dynamic political scientist might call it “The Trump Bump - for Liberals.”In Canada, the center-left was flailing until Trump made sovereignty the ballot question. In Australia, Albanese's numbers soared after Trump reignited trade wars. Even in the UK, Starmer’s favorability bumped up after standing visibly apart from Trump during an Oval Office meeting.“Trump has crippled, if not destroyed, the global trade architecture that has existed for 75 years,” said Bruce Wolpe, senior fellow at the US Studies Centre. That collapse is fueling an appetite for stability - and the left is the unlikely beneficiary.Carney's victory masks daunting challenges ahead:Mark Carney didn’t just beat Pierre Poilievre-he won a battle for Canadian identity. And Donald Trump, more than any Canadian political rival, handed him the victory.(With inputs from agencies)","Until January, the Canadian election looked like a slow-motion trainwreck for the Liberals.

After about 20 seconds, I realised that it was a terrorist attack and people on the ground are being killed,"" Bhatt said while recalling the incident. ""I saw 5-6 people getting shot.""After that, he detached himself from the zipline and fled with his family.""I unlatched my belt and jumped down, took my wife and son and started running away.

BENGALURU: A 16-year-old boy was stripped, filmed and blackmailed, allegedly by a social media friend and his associates, in central Bengaluru recently.The boy was also coerced into falsely admitting on film that he had captured inappropriate images of girls and extorted money from them. After the miscreants demanded money from the boy, his mother alleged that a female friend of her son had egged on those who targeted him.The boy is a class 10 student of a private school in CBD who resides in south Bengaluru. According to the complaint lodged by his mother with Adugodi police on April 25, the incident took place between 3pm and 8pm on April 5.The boy called his mother around 1.30pm and informed her that he was going to a friend's house. He returned home around 9pm and locked himself in his room. His mother noticed he appeared disturbed and eventually managed to cajole him into opening up about what had happened.A while ago, the boy had become acquainted with one Arif (name changed) on a social media platform and even met him a few times in person. Six months earlier, Arif had allegedly borrowed the boy's earbuds and mobile phone, later returning only the phone.Their interactions ceased three months ago after the boy decided to cut ties. However, on April 5, Arif contacted the boy after spotting him riding a two-wheeler near Nimhans, and persuaded him to meet him.When they met on April 5, Arif got into the boy's vehicle and took him to the parking lot of a residential building where five of the former's friends were waiting. In the parking lot, the group allegedly threatened the boy with a stick, asking him to undress.When he refused, they forcibly stripped him. They then allegedly coerced him into falsely stating on video that he had recorded inappropriate images of girls and extorted Rs 50,000 from one of the victims. The group threatened to upload the video on social media and share it with his peers unless he paid them Rs 10,000 the following morning.The group left him only after threatening him not to inform his mother or police about the incident.The mother told police she delayed filing a complaint out of fear her son could be harmed. She also alleged that this was all planned by her son's female friend, who encouraged Arif to target him. A senior cop said, ""We aren't sure about the age of the accused.They have gone incommunicado; we're making efforts to trace them.""

Why were the opposition members arrested?

What is Hong Kong's national security law?

Four former opposition lawmakers, jailed in Hong Kong's landmark national security case last year, were released on Tuesday after completing their time in prison.They were the first among 45 convicted that were released from jail.All four individuals were transported from prison in vehicles with their curtains drawn.The four opposition figures pleaded guilty and were each sentenced to four years and two months in prison in November.Last year, authorities in Hong Kong arrested 47 individuals on charges of subversion under a national security law imposed by Beijing.The figures included some notable democracy advocates, elected lawmakers, district councilors, unionists and academics.During the trial two were found not guilty. The 45 others received sentences between four to 10 years.The four opposition members released on Tuesday were in custody since March 2021 and received the lightest penalty among the convicted.The arrests came after Beijing passed a national security law in 2020 in response to large pro-democracy protests in the financial hub.Under that law, Hong Kong democrats were accused of conspiring to subvert state power through a multi-step plan. The group organized a primary election in 2020 to secure a legislative majority and rejected the government budget.The sentences have been condemned by Western governments and rights groups. The United States labelled the penalties as ""unjust"" and the United Nations Human Rights Office also expressed grave concern.Hong Kong and Beijing assert that everyone is equal under the national security laws and that the democrats received a fair trial.Hong Kong has arrested 322 people for national security crimes and convicted 163 of them in April under the national security law.","Four former opposition lawmakers, jailed in Hong Kong's landmark national security case last year, were released on Tuesday.

'Serious disruption'

France affected

MADRID: Lights flickered back to life in Spain and Portugal early Tuesday after a massive blackout hit the Iberian peninsula stranding passengers in trains and hundreds of elevators while millions saw phone and internet coverage die.More than 80 per cent of Spain's national electricity supply had been restored by early Tuesday, the REE power operator said. Lights came on again in Madrid and in Portugal's capital.Barely a corner of the peninsula, which has a joint population of almost 60 million people, escaped. But no firm cause for the shutdown has yet emerged, though wild rumours spread on messaging networks about cyber attacks.Portuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said the source of the outage was ""probably in Spain"". Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said ""all the potential causes"" were being analysed and warned the public ""not to speculate"" because of the risk of ""misinformation"".Sanchez said about 15 gigawatts of electricity, more than half of the power being consumed at the time, ""suddenly disappeared"" in about five seconds.Sanchez was unable to say when power would be completely restored in Spain and warned that some workers would have to stay home Tuesday.
