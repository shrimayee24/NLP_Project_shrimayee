US military strategist slams Trump admin for not blocking IMF aid to Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-military-strategist-slams-trump-admin-for-not-blocking-imf-aid-to-pak/articleshow/121196427.cms,"US President Donald Trump

NEW DELHI: Michael Rubin, a military strategist with a conservative-leaning US think tank, American Enterprise Institute, has faulted the Trump administration for facilitating a $1 billion IMF bailout package to Pakistan, particularly at a time when the latter is seen as sponsoring terrorists’ as a state policy.“By sending money to Pakistan, the IMF is also effectively bailing out China. Pakistan is today a satrapy of China, its Gwadar port was the original pearl on China’s string, and its China-Pakistan Economic Corridor has put Islamabad $40 billion in the red,” said Rubin, who taught at the Naval Postgraduate School till 2021.Rubin joined other international American security experts in asserting that India scored a victory in the four-day limited conflict with Pakistan, calling out the latter’s bluff on inflicting a cost on New Delhi. Instead, he said, it was Islamabad that “went running like a scared dog with its tail between its legs” to achieve a ceasefire.“There is absolutely no spin Pak military can put on what occurred to shield themselves from the full reality of the fact that they not only lost, but they lost very, very badly,” Rubin says in a video comment, dismantling the propaganda peddled by Islamabad, still smarting from a complete defeat under Indian attack on its crucial air bases and critical military installations.In an Op-Ed on Wednesday, Rubin blasted US for not blocking IMF releasing a $1 billion bailout package to Pakistan, one of the “world’s most corrupt countries”. He further says that the IMF move came after Pak-based terrorists infiltrated India and executed non-Muslims in front of their families.The military strategist said that to release $1 billion to a terror-addled, pro-China regime at a time the White House has been seeking to de-escalate tensions between two nuclear states was not just about Pakistan; it was about the IMF thumbing its nose at President Donald Trump.","Michael Rubin, a military strategist with a conservative-leaning US think tank, American Enterprise Institute, has faulted the Trump administration for facilitating a $1 billion IMF bailout package to Pakistan.

"‘Khet mein tank, jeet ka prank’: Pakistan's Shehbaz Sharif ridiculed for airbase visit after PM Modi’s Adampur tour, netizens call it ‘TikTok war PR stunt’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/khet-mein-tank-jeet-ka-prank-pakistans-shehbaz-sharif-ridiculed-for-airbase-visit-after-pm-modis-adampur-tour-netizens-call-it-tiktok-war-pr-stunt/articleshow/121188249.cms,"NEW DELHI: A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the Adampur airbase in Punjab to boost troop morale following India's decisive Operation Sindoor , Pakistan's PM Shehbaz Sharif attempted a similar show of support by visiting troops at the Pasrur Cantonment in Sialkot. However, Sharif's move was widely mocked and criticised as an unsuccessful attempt to match PM Modi's leadership display.He visited Pasrur and Sialkot airbases (or what’s left of them) to declare an alleged “victory” under the theatrically named “Operation Bunyan al-Marsoos.”But the Pakistani PR attempt backfired. Social media exploded with memes, calling Sharif a “copycat,” mocking the barren backdrop of his speech from atop a tank, and asking whether he was addressing soldiers or scarecrows on a field.“Shehbaz Sharif’s obsession with India is unreal. Modi visits a real airbase, Shehbaz rushes to a random farm like: ‘Look! No damage here!’ From PM to PR clown, Shehbaz is the only leader who treats national security like a TikTok trend,” one user posted.In the viral video of his visit, flanked by Pakistan army chief general Asim Munir and what appeared to be borrowed tanks, Sharif boldly claimed Pakistan had “defeated India,” framing it as revenge for 1971. That’s when the memes really took off.“War khud hi announce karo, khud hi jeet jao, aur khud hi tali bhi baja lo, kya baat hai Pakistan!” a user joked.“PM Shehbaz Sharif: ‘We have won the war.’ Meanwhile, even their GPS can't find the airstrip,” quipped another.While PM Modi walked shoulder-to-shoulder with IAF personnel and was pictured beside S-400 systems and MiG-29 fighters, Sharif’s visuals featured him standing solo atop a tank in what users called a “crop field.” No runway, no radar, no aircraft — just dusty ground and declarations.“Picture of Shehbaz Sharif from Kirana Hills,” mocked one user, referencing unverified reports of a nuclear radiation leak in the region — which India has denied striking.“They will do everything India does, even if they don’t have the resources,” another added.The trolling continued with users dubbing the Pakistani leader as “PR Minister” and drawing parallels with Bollywood and sitcom characters. Clips from Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah, Gangs of Wasseypur, and Welcome were edited to mock the speech.“Udit Bhai feat,” wrote a user, referencing the viral “Welcome” meme.“Modi to Shehbaz Sharif,” another captioned a Gangs of Wasseypur clip showing a character laughing uncontrollably.The Pakistani PMO posted filtered photos of Sharif with troops but conspicuously avoided any shots of runways or airstrips, a fact not lost on online commentators, many of whom believe this confirms the heavy damage inflicted by India during Operation Sindoor.India has denied Pakistan’s counter-claims of downing jets or damaging airbases. PM Modi’s landing in a Hercules aircraft and speech from a fully operational airstrip was seen as a mic-drop moment.“Shehbaz Sharif trying to copy Modi is like a school kid copying homework but forgetting the main question,” a meme read.Notably, this isn’t Sharif’s first Modi mimicry. After Modi restructured India’s National Security Advisory Board with a former RAW chief, Sharif made headlines for appointing ISI chief Gen Asim Malik as NSA. His speeches post-terror attacks often echo PM Modi’s tone - minus the audience, impact, or airpower.“From Kirana Hills to copycat thrills, Shehbaz Sharif’s only battlefield is Twitter,” one user said.India’s Operation Sindoor, launched after Pakistan’s drone and missile attacks, reportedly damaged multiple airbases across Pakistan. International media like The New York Times and The Washington Post acknowledged India’s upper hand.PM Modi, addressing IAF personnel, declared, “Ghar mein ghus ke maarenge,” while Sharif was left fending off online laughter.","Pakistan's PM Shehbaz Sharif attempted a similar show of support by visiting troops at the Pasrur Cantonment in Sialkot.

We killed Dalla ‘aide’ in Ontario: Lawrence gang,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-killed-dalla-aide-in-ontario-lawrence-gang/articleshow/121197188.cms,"Lawrence Bishnoi

Despite warning, Dhadda helped Dalla get bail

NEW DELHI: The Lawrence Bishnoi group claimed the killing of a Sikh businessman in Ontario’s Mississauga early Thursday. The victim, Harjit Singh Dhadda , was shot multiple times near his office. Bishnoi’s aide, Rohit Godara , owned up to the killing, accusing Dhadda of furnishing a bail bond for Khalistan Tiger Force chief Arsh Dalla.“I, Rohit Godara, along with Goldy Brother, am taking responsibility. This man was close to our enemies. He got his brother Mehal Singh Uttarakhand murdered by giving money to Arsh Dalla and Sukha Dunuke. All were named in that case,” Godara said in a post.Godara’s post said Dhadda was given a warning a year ago but despite that he helped Arsh Dalla’s release on bail two months ago. “This will be the fate of whoever supports our enemy,” it added.Dhadda, a businessman in the trucking services industry, was shot dead near the intersection of Telford Way and Derry Road in Mississauga, Canada, the local police said. Dhadda was standing near his car when unidentified assailants, believed to have been lying in wait, approached and fired around 20 rounds before fleeing the scene. The gunfire caused panic in the parking lot.A staffer of a local office narrowly avoided injury when a stray bullet entered their office and hit an empty chair, just moments after they stood up. An eyewitness described the scene, saying the gunmen exited a parked car, fired many shots at close range. Dhadda was rushed to the hospital in critical condition but later succumbed to his injuries.Dalla, who replaced slain terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, fled to Canada in July 2020. He was linked to multiple heinous crimes such as murder, extortion, and targeted killings, with more than 13 FIRs registered against him. In January 2023, he was designated a terrorist by the Union home ministry for his involvement in a series of murders, extortion, terror funding, and targeted killings besides terrorist activities.Godara, on the other hand, is on Interpol’s list of wanted men. Interpol issued a red corner notice against Godara in December last year following a request from Indian law enforcement agencies. “On June 13, 2022, Godara is learnt to have fled from Delhi to Dubai on a forged passport issued in the name of one ‘Pawan Kumar’. He is learnt to have taken the same route as his associate, Sachin Bishnoi, who also went to Azerbaijan and was staying in Baku,” said an official.","Harjit Singh Dhadda was shot multiple times near his office.

'Army uniform should not be seen through casteist lens': Yogi Adityanath

NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Ram Gopal Yadav on Thursday sparked a controversy with a remark on the caste of Wing Commander Vyomika Singh of the Indian Air Force.Wing Commander Singh was a regular face in the press briefings on the Indian armed forces' ""Operation Sindoor,"" along with foreign secretary Vikram Misri and Colonel Sofiya Qureshi. Already, there is nationwide anger over the statement by a Madhya Pradesh BJP leader targeting Colonel Qureshi.Yadav made the remark while addressing a programme in Moradabad. He took a dig at the ruling BJP for its pan-India ""Tiranga Yatra"" celebrating the successful military operation.""These people (BJP) are taking out the Tiranga Yatra... They do everything only for elections. What is the need to take out the Tiranga Yatra? If there is a need, then the whole country should be taken into confidence, all the political parties should be taken into confidence. Those who fought there (in Operation Sindoor), are they from the BJP?"" news agency PTI quoted him as saying.Referring to the objectionable comment made by Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah for Colonel Qureshi, the Rajya Sabha MP added, ""One of their ministers abused Colonel Qureshi. The high court has ordered registration of a case against him again. But he did not know who Vyomika Singh was and neither did he know about Air Marshal AK Bharti, otherwise these people would have abused them too.""Yadav further stated, ""Let me tell you. Vyomika Singh is a Jatav from Haryana and Air Marshal Bharti is a Yadav from Purnia. So all three are from PDA (Picchda, dalit, Alpsankhyak or Backwards, dalits and minorities). One was abused as she is a Muslim. The other was spared as the abusers thought she is a Rajput.""Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the SP national general secretary should not see the army through ""casteist lens.""""The uniform of the army is not to be seen through 'casteist lens'.

LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party national general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav on Thursday stoked a controversy as he invoked the castes of Wing Commander Vyomika Singh and Air Marshal A K Bharti — who were part of the media briefings on Operation Sindoor — to mount an attack on BJP , with the latter shredding him for using “casteist glasses” to look at the armed forces.Talking to the media in Moradabad, Yadav accused BJP of carrying out ‘Tiranga Yatras’ to use Operation Sindoor for political mileage. He said BJP members, who had attacked Col Sofiya Qureshi — who was also part of the briefings along with Wing Commander Vyomika — because of her religion, would have done the same to the two IAF officers, too, if they knew about their castes.“They didn’t even know who Vyomika Singh was or what her caste is, nor did they know about Air Marshal A K Bharti. Otherwise, they would’ve hurled abuses at them, too. Let me tell you, Vyomika Singh is a Jatav from Haryana, and Air Marshal Bharti is a Yadav from Purnia,” he said, grouping the three armed forces officers as “constituents of the Pichhda-Dalit-Alpsankhyak (PDA) bloc”.Referring to Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah’s objectionable comment on Col Sofiya, the SP veteran said: “One was abused because she was a Muslim. One (Wg Cdr Vyomika) was thought to be a Rajput, so nothing was said.”Yadav’s comments evoked a sharp response from Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath , who hit out at the SP neta saying his statement showed his “narrow-mindedness”, and was against the honour of the armed forces. “Every soldier of the Indian Army performs ‘Rashtradharma’ and is not a representative of any caste or religion,” Yogi said in a post on X, admonishing the SP politician for confining a “veerangana (brave) daughter” within the confines of caste.Yogi said it was this “distorted casteist mentality” that divided even patriotism just for the sake of appeasement and vote bank politics.BJP national spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia called Yadav’s statement “shameful, reprehensible and criminal.”UP BJP president Bhupendra Chaudhary said Yadav’s remarks were an insult not just to Army and valour of soldiers, but also to crores of Scheduled Caste people. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and his uncle Ram Gopal Yadav could not digest Pakistan’s defeat, and that’s why “they are looking for caste in the Army”, he alleged.Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya said, “Army is beyond caste and religion. Their religion is to protect the country.

He wants its nuclear arsenal under IAEA watch. Singh says Pakistan's nuclear threats failed to deter India's response to terrorism. He calls Operation Sindoor the biggest action against terrorism. Singh adds that if Pakistan supports terrorism, it will pay a heavier price. He recalls Pakistan's past deception regarding terrorism.

Pak’s been deceiving India for long: Rajnath

NEW DELHI: Calling Pakistan a rogue nation with nukes, defence minister Rajnath Singh said Thursday its nuclear arsenal should be placed under the watch of International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ), and stressed that Islamabad’s nuclear blackmail failed to deter India’s response to terrorism under Operation Sindoor “PM Modi has redefined India’s policy against terrorism which now says that any attack on Indian soil will be considered as an act of war,” said Singh, addressing troops at Badami Bagh Cantonment in Srinagar on his first visit to J&K since Op Sindoor was launched May 7. Singh’s comments come soon after the PM drew a new red line, stressing that Pakistan’s nuclear blackmail will no longer work and India would continue to give cross-border kinetic responses to terror attacks.India has a clearly stated ‘no first-use’ nuclear weapons policy but Pakistan has deliberately left it ambiguous and often indulges in nuclear sabre-rattling. It brandishes, for instance, its short-range Nasr (Hatf-IX) and other missiles as a counter to India’s conventional military superiority.Pakistan, of course, has steadily built up its nuclear arsenal due to its well-documented proliferation nexus with China and North Korea. This nuclear option as a leverage against India came to the fore even last week when Islamabad first announced a meeting of its nuclear National Command Authority but then subsequently backed down amid global concern.At Srinagar, noting that the world has witnessed how irresponsibly Islamabad has issued nuclear threats to New Delhi several times, Singh said, “I raise this question before the world: Are nuclear weapons safe in the hands of such an irresponsible and rogue nation? Pakistan’s nuclear weapons should be taken under the supervision of the IAEA.”The defence minister called Operation Sindoor the “biggest action” taken by India against terrorism in history, and a testament to the nation’s commitment to go to any extent to eliminate the menace. “Our forces have shown to the world that their aim is precise and pinpointed, and the task of counting (the body bags) is left to the enemies,” he said.Terrorists targeted tourists in Pahalgam based on their “dharma” (religion), but the Indian forces killed terrorists based on their “karma” (deeds) in the long-range strikes conducted in Pakistan and PoK on May 7, Rajnath said. “It was the dream of every soldier that we will reach terrorist hideouts and destroy them. It was our dharma to eliminate the terrorists.” Addressing the troops, chief minister Omar Abdullah and Army chief Gen Upendra Dwivedi, Singh said India has always prioritised peace and never supported war but when its sovereignty is attacked, it is necessary to respond. “If Pakistan continues to support terrorism, it will pay a heavier price,” he said. Recalling Pakistan’s declaration about 21 years ago in front of then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee that terrorism will no longer be exported from its land, Singh said Pakistan has been “deceiving India” for long. Pakistan must stop sheltering anti-India terrorist organisations and not allow its land to be used against India, he said.Pakistan has reached an abysmal state where it seeks loans from the IMF, while India falls in the category of those countries which provide funds to the IMF so that they can help poor countries, he added.",Rajnath Singh calls Pakistan a rogue nation with nukes.

And we got it settled. I hope, I hope I don't walk out of here and two days later find out that it's not settled, but I think it is settled,” Trump said.He also again claimed that he talked to the countries about trade. “Let's do trade instead of do war.

BIJAPUR: A four-legged CRPF soldier, adept at taking the sting out of Maoist attack plans with its infantry patrolling, explosive detection and assault skills and manoeuvres, fell to a sting-assault by 200 honeybees to attain martyrhood in the biggest-ever anti-Naxal operation .K9 Rolo, a handsome Belgian Malinois who got past its second birthday only last month, was part of the 21-day operation by the CRPF and Chhattisgarh police at Karreguttalu Hills on Chhattisgarh-Telangana border. Trained at the CRPF dog breeding and training school (DBTS), Bengaluru, it was drafted into anti-Naxal duties in CRPF 228th battalion in April 2024.During the special operation at KGH, while Rolo and other CRPF troops were in the midst of an intensive search operation, a swarm of bees waylaid the dog, embedding scores of stings into his otherwise combat-trained body.Handlers of the K9 soldier moved fast, shielding it with a polythene sheet to cut off the bee attack . Unfortunately, this did not help as the bees managed to sneak inside the cover to resume their stinging assault with added force.Rolo, by then overwhelmed with pain and irritation, went berserk and shook the cover off, making itself vulnerable to even more bites. By the end of the ordeal, it had around 200 bee stings inside him, which rendered it unconscious. An immediate medical evacuation was performed by its human co-soldiers. Emergency treatment was administered by the handlers. However, Rolo succumbed to the pain and suffering while still being evacuated.K9 was declared ‘brought dead’ by the veterinary doctor. The canine martyr laid its life being a loyal soldier and assisting CRPF in busting hideouts and sniffing out explosives dumps dotting KG Hills.

Institutions like Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), Jamia Millia Islamia and Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University (CSJMU), have already suspended or terminated their academic collaborations with Turkish higher education institutions, while Delhi University is reviewing its MoUs.In a strongly worded letter, “Appeal for National Solidarity in Response to Pakistan and Its Allies’ State-Sponsored Terrorism Against India”, to all the 1,100 universities, AIU president professor Vinay Kumar Pathak condemned what he described as “state-sponsored terrorism” and criticised countries such as Turkiye and Bangladesh for supporting anti-India narratives. “These efforts aim to destabilise our democratic fabric and national unity,” the letter reads, calling on Indian universities to “review and, if needed, suspend or end” partnerships with institutions in the three nations.JNU has suspended an MoU with Turkiye’s Inonu University “due to national security considerations as JNU stands with the nation and the armed forces, many of whom are JNU Alumni,” said Santishree Dhulipudi Pandit, VC of the university. Jamia has suspended all forms of collaborations with Turkish educational and other establishments. UP govt-run CSJMU has terminated its MoUwith Istanbul University.The AIU letter frames the appeal as a patriotic duty, emphasising the need for “national solidarity” over academic convenience. It encourages institutions to put the integrity and sovereignty of the nation above global engagements where anti-India propaganda is evident. While critics may see this as a politicisation of education, AIU said the appeal is rooted in protecting India’s core values and national interest. “India’s academic institutions stand united in condemnation of terrorism,” the letter declared.","The Association of Indian Universities (AIU) Thursday wrote to vice chancellors across the country urging them to sever academic ties with institutions in Pakistan, Turkiye, and Bangladesh.

BENGALURU: Armed with nothing more than a desire to shower gifts on his girlfriend, a 27-year-old man from Assam entered a mobile store, cherrypicked costly phones in a quick operation post midnight and disappeared the way he came in: In the buff, wearing only a mask to partially cover his face.He had shed his clothes and walked stark naked into the store in Hongasandra, south Bengaluru, through a two-foot hole in the wall because of a bizarre reason: He didn't want to spoil his new dress while squeezing in.When Hanuman Telecom in Hongasandra was burgled on the night of May 9, police first suspected the involvement of an organised criminal gang. However, CCTV footage showed a figure moving inside the store with remarkable precision, picking phones worth over Rs 15,000 and ignoring cheaper models. What baffled them, though, wasn't the thief's selectivity—it was his complete nakedness.The man, later identified as 27-year-old Imranullah from Assam, had drilled a two-foot-wide hole on the wall and gained entry into the shop. His explanation, when caught, was both bizarre and sincere: he had just bought new clothes and didn't want to ruin them by squeezing through the narrow hole.The theft took place between 1.30am and 3am when shop owner Dinesh, a native of Rajasthan, was away due to a family emergency.At 4pm the next day, Dinesh checked his store's CCTV feed remotely and saw the break-in. He immediately alerted his friend Vasanaram who works at a mobile shop nearby on Hosa Road.""I rushed to the shop and saw the hole drilled into the left wall. I informed the police immediately and filed a complaint,"" said Vasanaram. When police and Vasanaram entered the shop, they found several high-value mobile phones missing from the display case.The footage clearly showed two men—one acting as lookout while the other, naked and masked, crawled through the wall and moved with purpose. He carried a bag and carefully selected the costlier phones, avoiding those of lesser value. He kept the lights off, and used the torch on his mobile for his operation.Police arrested Imranullah the next day. Investigators said he had entered the shop with only a face mask and a bag. ""He claimed he needed money to spend on his girlfriend. His plan was to sell the phones in the black market,"" a senior officer said.The shop's surveillance system provided clear footage of his actions. Forensic teams collected additional evidence at the scene. Police are now investigating the accomplice who remained outside during the burglary.While the method was crude, the execution showed planning. ""The hole was just big enough for someone with his build. He knew the store layout and the camera angles. He was focused only on the phones of higher value,"" said the officer.Dinesh, back in Bengaluru, credited the swift action of police. ""I was away for just one night, and it happened. Thankfully, the stolen items have been recovered,"" he said.Police have registered a case under sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita sections 331 (Punishment for house-trespass or housebreaking) and 305 (Theft in a dwelling house, or means of transportation or place of worship, etc). Imranullah remains in custody, while investigators continue their search for the second accused.","A 27-year-old man from Assam entered a mobile store, cherrypicked costly phones in a quick operation post midnight and disappeared the way he came in.

HYDERABAD: A video showing women washing the feet of Miss World contestants during a visit to historic Ramappa temple in Telangana has sparked controversy, news agency PTI reported.The footage circulated on social media, shows a group of contestants seated in a row at the Ramappa Temple in Mulugu district while a few women pour water on their feet and wipe them with towels.The act, described as part of a traditional welcome, took place during a cultural visit organised for the Miss World contestants, who are touring Telangana ahead of the pageant’s grand finale in Hyderabad on 31 May.The Telangana government defended the gesture, saying it was in keeping with the Indian tradition of Atithi Devo Bhava , which treats guests as divine.In a post on social media platform 'X', it said the act was meant to honour the international visitors in line with local customs.However, opposition leaders strongly criticised the event, calling it degrading and disrespectful, particularly to the women involved—many of whom, they claimed, belonged to Dalit, tribal and economically weaker backgrounds.“The Congress CM has officially lost his mind,” said K T Rama Rao, working president of the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS), who reposted the video on X.In a party statement, the BRS described the incident as “appalling” and said it had “deeply hurt the self-respect of Telangana.”Union minister and Telangana BJP chief G Kishan Reddy also condemned the act, accusing the Congress party of continuing what he called its ""legacy of making Indians kneel before foreigners.""He said chief minister Revanth Reddy had “trampled on the dignity and self-respect of Indian women in a desperate attempt to please his party high command.”BRS legislator and former minister Sabitha Indra Reddy also weighed in, saying the act dishonoured the legacy of powerful women from the region, such as Rudramadevi, Sammakka, and Saralakka. “This has not only shamed Telangana but also tarnished the image of Indian women globally,” she said.More than 100 Miss World contestants are currently visiting key tourist sites across Telangana as part of a state-led initiative to promote cultural heritage and tourism.The Ramappa Temple, where the incident occurred, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site known for its Kakatiya-era architecture.The government has not commented on whether the ritual was pre-planned or voluntarily performed by the local women.The Dignity Foundation and other women's rights groups also have also voiced concern calling for further clarification on the circumstances surrounding the event.","Video shows women washing the feet of Miss World contestants during a visit to a historic temple in Telangana.

Gaza’s only cancer hospital shuts; nearly 1 million face hunger crisis

From October 7 attack to ongoing bloodshed





Over 54 people were killed overnight in intense shelling on the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis on Thursday. This followed Wednesday’s bombings across northern and southern Gaza that claimed at least 70 lives, bringing the two-day death toll to 120.The Israeli military did not have any immediate response to the airstrikes.According to news agency AP, the Gaza health ministry said that 82 bodies had been brought to hospitals over the past 24 hours following Israeli airstrikes, including 54 from Khan Younis.The escalation comes as US President Donald Trump tours the Middle East, visiting several Gulf nations but not Israel. His trip raised hopes that it might lead to a ceasefire agreement or the resumption of humanitarian aid to Gaza, which remains under an Israeli blockade now entering its third month.Earlier this week, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to escalate Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, reiterating his goal of eliminating the Hamas militant group that governs the territory, news agency AP reported. “With great strength to complete the mission,” emphasising that the objective was “the destruction of Hamas.”Gaza’s health ministry also said that the European Hospital Khan Younis, the only hospital in Gaza still offering cancer treatments, is no longer operating.The facility was badly damaged in Israeli airstrikes, and nearby roads were also hit, making it inaccessible.According to the integrated food security phase classification (IPC), a leading authority on global hunger crises, nearly 500,000 Palestinians are facing possible starvation, and nearly 1 million are struggling to access enough food to survive.Israeli government spokesman David Mencer on Thursday denied that there is a food shortage in Gaza. He claimed that Hamas is withholding supplies, saying, “they need to open up the food to the people.”The conflict began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants launched an incursion into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people. In response, Israel launched a large-scale military offensive that has since resulted in the deaths of more than 53,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Nearly 3,000 people have been killed since Israel broke a ceasefire on March 18.Hamas is still holding 58 of the approximately 250 hostages taken during its October 7 attack on Israel. Of those, 23 are believed to still be alive, though Israeli officials have raised concerns about the condition of three of them.","54 people killed overnight in intense shelling on the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis.

'Framework'





BRUSSELS: The EU and Britain look will haggle to the wire over fishing rights and food checks as they seek a deal on closer defence ties at a landmark post-Brexit summit next week.The meeting in London on Monday between UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the EU's top officials was planned to bring the first results from London's much-vaunted ""reset"" in ties.Inking a defence and security partnership is seen as a symbolic step in turning the tide after the years of bad blood since Britain's exit from the bloc on January 31, 2020.But old habits die hard and the two sides are squabbling to the last over long-standing bugbears that threaten to stall the rapprochement.Diplomats in Brussels said negotiations were focused on getting Britain to keep its waters open for European fishermen, in return for the EU easing checks on some food imports from the UK.Other sticking points include an EU push for a scheme allowing young people to move more easily between the two sides that London fears threatens its red line on returning to free movement.""They want everything and they're giving nothing,"" one European diplomat complained of the British stance, speaking like others on condition of anonymity.EU chief Ursula von der Leyen and Starmer could look to give the talks a final shove over the finishing line at a summit of European leaders in Albania on Friday.If they can overcome the last hurdles, then the ""security and defence partnership"" to be signed would be the highlight of the London sit-down.The move is aimed at opening the door to closer cooperation as both the EU and Britain race to rearm in the face of the threat from Russia and fears US President Donald Trump will no longer help protect Europe.That should mean more regular security talks, Britain considering joining EU military missions and the potential for London to fully tap into a 150-billion-euro ($167-billion) defence fund being set up by the bloc.But the deal is expected to leave much of the detail to be filled in later -- for instance requiring a further agreement on giving the UK and its defence industry unfettered access to the EU programmes.""It's a framework for more cooperation,"" another EU diplomat said.Reaching the security pact was long seen as the lowest hanging fruit for negotiators given that Britain already has intertwined defence ties with 23 EU countries in NATO.Those bonds have only tightened as Trump has rattled Europe by pushing for a quick end to the war in Ukraine.Britain has teamed up with France to spearhead plans for possibly deploying troops to Ukraine in the event of any deal.A UK government official speaking on condition of anonymity said the defence pact is expected to be agreed.Another British official familiar with the matter stressed that Monday was just the first in a series of annual summits.""Inevitably there are things that are agreed for this summit, there will be things we agree to carry on discussing, and things we don't get over the line at all,"" they said.The defence partnership was envisioned to be inked alongside two other documents.One sets out a shared vision on global issues and another lists the thorny subjects both sides hope to make progress on in the coming months.London and Brussels are treading carefully as closer cooperation with the EU remains a politically divisive issue for Starmer who faces a growing challenge from diehard anti-EU Reform UK.","EU and Britain look will haggle to the wire over fishing rights and food checks.

Family members of a Black motorist fatally shot by a deputy in southwestern Washington state during a traffic stop have settled their wrongful death lawsuit for $3.5 million.The Clark County Council agreed Wednesday to make the payment in the 2021 death of 30-year-old Jenoah Donald , The Columbian reported.Donald lived in the city of Battle Ground, Washington, and died Feb 12, eight days after he was shot in the head by Sean Boyle, a deputy with the Clark Sounty Sheriff's Office.The family filed the federal lawsuit in 2022 in US District Court in Tacoma alleging wrongful death, assault and battery, negligence and deprivation of civil rights. Trial was set to start June 9.Attorneys for the Donald family said in a statement that the settlement provides accountability and closure.""This outcome honors Jenoah Donald's life and underscores a simple truth: When officers ignore their training and resort to needless lethal force, they will be held accountable,"" attorney Angus Lee said in the statement.The county ""continues to deny liability for this unfortunate incident,"" county spokeswoman Joni McAnally told the newspaper.Prosecuting attorneys from outside Clark County examined the shooting and found it was justified in protecting the deputies.Deputies that night responded to a call about two cars suspiciously driving around a neighborhood and pulled over Donald's car for what they described as a faulty rear light.Lawyers for Donald's family argued in the lawsuit that was an unlawful stop, citing a 1999 Washington Supreme Court case that found it is unconstitutional for police to use a traffic stop as an excuse to investigate suspected criminal activity.The family's attorneys said Donald was cooperative initially. The situation escalated after another deputy, Holly Troupe, said she saw a sharp object inside Donald's vehicle, which investigators later said was a screwdriver.A struggle ensued as Boyle and Troupe tried to pull Donald out of the car, an outside investigation showed. Boyle fired twice when Donald ignored commands to let him go as the car lurched forward with the deputy partially inside, according to investigators. One bullet hit and killed Donald.Donald was on the autism spectrum and prone to withdrawal in stressful situations, his lawyers have said.Donald was the second Black man killed by deputies in four months. On Oct 29, a law enforcement task force attempted a drug sting involving 21-year-old Kevin Peterson Jr that ended with three deputies firing at Peterson as he ran away while carrying a gun.Peterson's family, represented by the same attorneys, sued the county in 2022. The county later agreed to pay his family $1.25 million to settle the lawsuit. That shooting also was deemed justified by prosecutors.","The Clark County Council agreed Wednesday to make the payment in the 2021 death of 30-year-old Jenoah Donald.

The implications are vast: more than 150,000 newborns could be denied citizenship annually if the order is upheld, according to the plaintiffs challenging the directive, which includes Democratic attorneys general from 22 states and immigrant rights advocates.At issue is the interpretation of the 14th Amendment , which states that all “persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,” are US citizens. Trump's administration argues this language does not extend to the children of immigrants whose presence is either unlawful or temporary, such as students or visa workers. This interpretation represents a stark departure from more than a century of legal precedent.In oral arguments, Solicitor General D. John Sauer defended the order by claiming the 14th Amendment was only intended to grant citizenship to the children of formerly enslaved people.When pressed by Justice Brett Kavanaugh on how the government would determine the citizenship of newborns under this policy, Sauer admitted, “We just don’t know.”Justice Elena Kagan voiced concern over the lack of clarity and questioned why the administration was challenging a precedent so firmly rooted in history. “If one thinks that it's quite clear that the order is illegal, how does one get to that result in what time frame... without the possibility of a nationwide injunction?” she asked. Justice Amy Coney Barrett appeared sceptical of Sauer’s assurance that the issue could work its way through the lower courts without disrupting the current system.The precedent in question is the Supreme Court’s 1898 ruling in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, which affirmed citizenship for children born in the US regardless of their parents' immigration status. Wong, born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrants, was denied re-entry after a trip abroad. The court ruled in his favour, cementing the principle of jus soli citizenship by birth.There are only a few exceptions to this principle: children of foreign diplomats, enemy occupiers, and those born in unincorporated US territories like American Samoa are not automatically granted citizenship. However, the Trump administration’s order, if upheld, would mark a radical expansion of these exceptions.Critics warn that ending birthright citizenship could create a legal quagmire. New Jersey Solicitor General Jeremy Feigenbaum cautioned the court that such a change would lead to “unprecedented chaos,” creating a patchwork of legal statuses where children born on the same day in different states or even the same hospital might be treated differently. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson called the administration’s stance “a catch-me-if-you-can kind of regime,” where families would be forced to sue to assert rights that should be automatic.Protests have erupted outside the court as the case draws national attention. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi joined demonstrators, reading from the Constitution and defending the long-standing principle of birthright citizenship. “This is about birthright, it’s about citizenship, it’s about due process,” she said.Legal scholars note that overturning Wong Kim Ark would likely require a constitutional amendment, not just an executive order. Yet the Trump administration has hinted at additional measures such as limiting short-term visas for pregnant travellers as another way to discourage births by non-citizens in the US.If the court sides with Trump, it could restrict injunctions to only the named plaintiffs in the case, resulting in newborns across the country facing vastly different legal realities. In such a scenario, birth certificates might no longer suffice as proof of citizenship, creating uncertainty not just for immigrants, but for all Americans.","The US Supreme Court is deliberating a case that could fundamentally alter the definition of American citizenship.

'Can’t even buy parts on eBay': US transport secretary Sean Duffy flags deepening crisis in US air traffic control system,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cant-even-buy-parts-on-ebay-us-transport-secretary-sean-duffy-flags-deepening-crisis-in-us-air-traffic-control-system/articleshow/121199379.cms,"File photo: US transportation secretary Sean Duffy (Picture credit: AP)





US transportation secretary Sean Duffy has warned of a “crisis” in America’s air traffic control system, which is grappling with outdated equipment, severe staffing shortages and a series of high-profile failures, including deadly accidents and repeated outages.Speaking before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Thursday, Duffy revealed that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is so reliant on antiquated systems that it has resorted to searching for replacement parts on eBay and even 3D printing some components.“Sometimes, we can’t even buy it on eBay, so we’re trying to use 3D printing,” Duffy said, as per CBS News.The crisis has come under intense scrutiny following a fatal midair collision in January between a commercial jet and an Army helicopter near Reagan Washington National Airport that killed 67 people, according to WCHSTV.Additionally, equipment outages at the FAA facility responsible for Newark Liberty International Airport, along with similar issues in Denver and Atlanta, have caused severe flight disruptions.According to CBS News, Newark had just three controllers on duty at one point, compared to the target staffing of 14.Duffy insisted that “the system we currently use… is 25, 35, 40 years old in some places. We’ve let it age, and now we’re seeing the cracks play out in real time.”He urged lawmakers to support the Trump administration’s proposed multi-billion-dollar overhaul of the system, which includes replacing hundreds of radars, new telecommunications infrastructure, and over a dozen new control towers.The Government Accountability Office has already found that 76% of the FAA’s 138 control systems are unsustainable or potentially unsustainable.Despite concerns, Duffy stressed that air travel remains safe thanks to “multiple redundancies.” However, he conceded that delays and system malfunctions, like the 90-second communications blackout in Denver earlier this week, highlight just how fragile the current infrastructure is.Duffy also addressed criticism over recent layoffs, clarifying that while probationary staff were let go as part of broader federal workforce reductions, no air traffic controllers were cut.“We’ve been hiring air traffic controllers as quickly as we can,” he said, pushing back against concerns from Democrats like Sen Patty Murray, who criticised reports of mistaken buyout emails sent to FAA staff.To address the shortfall of 3,000 controllers, the department of transportation has implemented measures like expedited medical testing and retention bonuses for experienced personnel.As Rep Rick Larsen told the House during a related hearing, “The safety of the traveling public cannot continue being put at risk... We need action now.” The FAA is currently in talks with airlines to possibly reduce flights out of Newark, which has seen over 140 cancellations on Thursday alone, amid ongoing staffing challenges.",US transportation secretary Sean Duffy has warned of a ‘crisis’ in America’s air traffic control system.

Medical investigators have determined that a county sheriff in northern New Mexico died from the toxic effects of fentanyl and alcohol, according to autopsy results made public Thursday.Rio Arriba County Sheriff Billy Merrifield , 50, was found dead inside his patrol vehicle outside his Abiquiu home on Easter morning following a minor crash.The death of the popular sheriff - retained by voters in 2022 after his initial appointment - touched off investigations involving state police.

On Trump’s Nobel Prize prospects





A Pakistani journalist faced a sharp rebuff from the US state department official after attempting to question Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s stance on de-escalation talks between India and Pakistan. During a briefing on Wednesday, the Pakistani journalist portrayed former US President Donald Trump as a peace broker in the India-Pakistan standoff and claimed that India, particularly PM Modi, did not welcome Trump’s supposed ceasefire efforts.""Pakistan welcomed President Trump's efforts for bringing the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, and they believe that President Trump could win a Nobel Peace Prize if he were to bring peace between Pakistan and India on the Kashmir issue. But Prime Minister Modi did not welcome this effort... Does that disappoint this building at all, the attitude of Narendra Modi of not welcoming this peace deal,"" the reporter asked Tommy Pigott, principal deputy spokesperson at the US department of state.Sidestepping the pointed query, Pigott emphasised that the US was focused on maintaining the ceasefire. “That is what we are happy to see. That's where our focus remains. And we want to see a ceasefire be maintained, and we want to encourage direct communication.That is our focus here. Our focus is the ceasefire,” he said. Pigott reiterated that both India and Pakistan should maintain direct communication and pursue peace.While Trump has repeatedly claimed that his administration facilitated the India-Pakistan ceasefire, India has asserted that it was Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) who reached out to his Indian counterpart seeking a truce, driven by pressure after Indian strikes.Responding to the reporter’s claim that Trump deserved a Nobel Peace Prize for his role in easing India-Pakistan tensions, Pigott described Trump as a ""peacemaker.""""He's a peacemaker. He values peace. He's also a dealmaker, and he has shown that again and again and again in terms of both pursuing an America First agenda but also pursuing peace and wanting to see peace and conflicts come to an end,"" Pigott said.The journalist also brought up the use of Israeli drones by India during Operation Sindoor and questioned whether that might create complications between Pakistan and Israel, given Trump's Abraham Accords aimed at fostering ties among Jews, Muslims, and Christians.Pigott, however, steered the conversation back to Washington’s stated priorities: maintaining the ceasefire and encouraging direct dialogue between India and Pakistan. He reiterated that the US focus remains on resolving conflicts through peaceful means.","A Pakistani journalist portrayed former US President Donald Trump as a peace broker in the India-Pakistan standoff.

Poll Do you believe Robert F. Kennedy Jr. should be giving medical advice to the public? Yes, he is qualified No, he should not





US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told lawmakers on Wednesday that Americans “should not be taking medical advice” from him, reports news agency Reuters.Kennedy defended job cuts under the Trump administration and his controversial vaccine remarks during his first appearance before Congress.Being a long-time critic of vaccines, Kennedy was grilled by both the House Appropriations Committee and the Senate HELP Committee during back-to-back hearings. His remarks came amid a measles outbreak that has infected over 1,000 people and led to three deaths, mostly among the unvaccinated.When asked if he would give his children the measles vaccine today, Kennedy replied, “Measles? Probably for measles, what I would say is my opinions about vaccines are irrelevant. I don’t think people should be taking advice, medical advice, from me.”The hearings were meant to review US President Donald Trump ’s proposed 2026 health budget. Kennedy was confirmed in February and has already fired 10,000 staff across key agencies, including the FDA and CDC.He has also supported slashing $18 billion from the National Institutes of Health and $3.6 billion from the CDC, claiming the changes would “save taxpayers $1.8 billion per year.”“Our reductions have focused on aligning HHS staffing levels to reflect the size of HHS prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw around a 15% increase in the number of employees,” Kennedy told the House subcommittee.Democrats slammed the cuts as dangerous. “All while you peddle unfounded and dangerous vaccine skepticism, spread lies and misinformation about people living with autism,” said Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut.At the Senate hearing, Kennedy again declined to clearly support the MMR jab. “I’m not going to just tell people everything is safe and effective if I know that there’s issues,” he said.When asked whether Elon Musk had influenced his decisions, Kennedy denied taking orders but admitted Musk had assisted with fraud detection. “Elon Musk gave us help in trying and figuring out where there was fraud and abuse in the department. But it was up to me to make the decision,” he said.Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, who helped secure Kennedy’s confirmation, said Americans deserved clarity. “Americans need direct reassurance from the administration, from you, Mr. Secretary, that its reforms will make their lives easier, not harder.”Audience members protested during the hearing, wearing stickers reading “When Bobby lies, children die” and chanting “RFK kills people with AIDS” before being removed by Capitol police.","Kennedy defended job cuts under the Trump administration and his controversial vaccine remarks during his first appearance before Congress.

After US President Donald Trump offered to mediate between India and Pakistan on Kashmir, Tommy Pigott, principal deputy spokesperson for the US department of state, called the US president a ""peacemaker"" and underlined the importance of peace in the region.Pigott said the United States was pleased with the ongoing ceasefire between the two countries and said that the main objective was to promote direct talks between India and Pakistan.During a press briefing, Pigott said, ""What we are happy to see is a ceasefire. We want to encourage and see direct talks between the parties. Taking a step back, the President is a peacemaker, and we celebrate the advancement of peace. We hope the ceasefire will be maintained.""Earlier, on Sunday, US President Trump welcomed the end of hostilities between the two nations. He mentioned that many lives could have been lost if peace had not been achieved, referring to the risk of a nuclear conflict.In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""I am very proud of the strong and unwaveringly powerful leadership of India and Pakistan for having the strength, wisdom, and fortitude to fully know and understand that it was time to stop the current aggression that could have led to the death and destruction of so many, and so much.Millions of good and innocent people could have died! Your legacy is greatly enhanced by your brave actions. ""Trump also said that the US had played a role in helping the two sides reach peace and repeated his willingness to mediate on the Kashmir issue.""I am proud that the USA was able to help you arrive at this historic and heroic decision. While not even discussed, I am going to increase trade, substantially, with both of these great Nations. Additionally, I will work with you both to see if, after a 'thousand years,' a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir. God Bless the leadership of India and Pakistan on a job well done!!!""India has consistently rejected any outside involvement in the Kashmir issue. India has always opposed third-party involvement in the Kashmir issue. For New Delhi, it is a domestic and bilateral matter, to be addressed—if necessary—only in direct talks with Islamabad. This stance is supported by the 1972 Shimla Agreement and the 1999 Lahore Declaration. Any suggestion of external participation, particularly from a major power like the United States, is seen as interfering with India's strategic independence.External affais minister S Jaishankar also said on Thursday that India's relations and dealings with Pakistan will be ""strictly bilateral.""""To me things are fairly clear. So, let me take this opportunity to spell out our position. One, where Pakistan is concerned, our relations, our dealings with them will be bilateral, and strictly bilateral.""""That is a national consensus for many years, and there is absolutely no change in that consensus that dealings with Pakistan will be bilateral,"" Jaishankar said.","Tommy Pigott, principal deputy spokesperson for the US department of state, called the US president a ""peacemaker"" Pigott said the United States was pleased with the ongoing ceasefire between the two countries.

Criminal investigation opened in rape and sexual assault allegations against Smokey Robinson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/criminal-investigation-opened-in-rape-and-sexual-assault-allegations-against-smokey-robinson/articleshow/121199506.cms,"Smokey Robinson is under criminal investigation following allegations of rape and sexual assault made by four former housekeepers (Image: AP)





The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Thursday that it has opened a criminal investigation into rape and sexual assault allegations against Motown music luminary Smokey Robinson The department said in a statement that its Special Victims Bureau is ""actively investigating criminal allegations"" against Robinson.Last week, four former housekeepers of Robinson filed a lawsuit alleging that he repeatedly raped and sexually assaulted them, in some cases for years, while they worked for him.The suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court seeks at least $50 million in damages over the alleged assaults, which the women say took place between 2007 and 2024.Robinson's lawyer said there was no merit to the allegations against the 85-year-old musical icon who was among the biggest hitmakers of the 1960s.The attorney, Christopher Frost, said Tuesday the only reason for the suit is ""unadulterated avarice.""""We feel confident that a determination will be made that Mr Robinson did nothing wrong, and that this is a desperate attempt to prejudice public opinion and make even more of a media circus than the Plaintiffs were previously able to create,"" Frost said.John Harris and Herbert Hayden, the lawyers for the women, say they are pleased to learn that law enforcement is pursuing the allegations.""Our clients intend to fully cooperate with LASD's ongoing investigation in the pursuit of seeking justice for themselves and others that may have been similarly assaulted by him,"" the lawyers said.The sheriff's statement said the investigation is in its early stages, and no other details would be provided.Robinson's attorney said last week that the allegations ""defy credulity"" and are full of inconsistencies.The four women, whose names have not been made public, each allege that Smokey Robinson would wait until he was alone with them in his Los Angeles house and then sexually assault and rape them. One woman said she worked for Robinson from 2012 until 2024 and was assaulted at least 20 times. Another said she worked for him from 2014 until 2020 and was assaulted at least 23 times.Harris called Robinson a ""serial and sick rapist"" who must be stopped.When asked at a May 6 news conference whether the women had talked to police, Hayden said no, but felt the allegations merited law enforcement getting involved.All of the accusers said they eventually quit over the assaults. And all said they feared coming forward over fears of retaliation, public shame and possible effects on their immigration status.Robinson churned out a host of hits as a central part of the Motown Records machine - both with his group the Miracles and as a solo artist, with songs including ""Tears of a Clown"" and ""The Tracks of My Tears."" He also wrote and co-wrote songs for other Motown artists, including the Temptations' ""My Girl.""He is a member of both the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame.","The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Thursday that it has opened a criminal investigation into rape and sexual assault allegations against Motown music luminary Smokey Robinson.

Trump's Mideast trip splashes out on deals and diplomacy but is unusually quiet on human rights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-mideast-trip-splashes-out-on-deals-and-diplomacy-but-is-unusually-quiet-on-human-rights/articleshow/121199479.cms,"President Donald Trump speaks at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum at the King Abdulaziz International Conference Center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (Photo: AP)





Washington: Saudi royalty and American billionaires were in the front row for a speech in Riyadh where President Donald Trump condemned what he called past U.S. interference in the wealthy Gulf states. Gone were the days when American officials would fly to the Middle East to give ""you lectures on how to live, and how to govern your own affairs,"" Trump said at a Saudi investment forum this week.No one in the audience sat closer, or listened more intently, than Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.Ordinary Arabs listened, too, including Saudi journalists, rights advocates, businesspeople, writers and others who had fled the kingdom. Their fear: Trump's words underlined a message that the United States was pulling back from its longtime role as an imperfect, sporadic but powerful advocate for human rights around the world.""It was painful to see,"" said Abdullah Alaoudh, whose 68-year-old father, a Saudi cleric with a wide following, was among hundreds of royals, civil society figures, rights advocates and others jailed by Prince Mohammed in the first years of his rise to de facto ruler.Saudi Arabia has since freed many of those people in what groups say is the crown prince's improved human rights record following past international criticism and isolation. But Abdullah's father, Salman Alaoudh , is among the many still behind bars.Trump was speaking directly to the prince - ""the person who tortured my father, who has banned my family"" from leaving the kingdom, said Abdullah, who advocates for detained and imprisoned people in Saudi Arabia from the United States.The Saudi embassy did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.A White House spokeswoman, Anna Kelly, said Trump's speech ""celebrated the ever-growing partnership between the United States and Saudi Arabia"" and a Middle East working toward peace. Kelly did not respond to a question about whether the president had raised human rights issues with Gulf leaders.A State Department spokesman, Tommy Pigott , called Trump's discussions with Gulf leaders private.Less attention than usual on human rightsTrump's first major trip of his second term - also including Qatar and the United Arab Emirates - drew far less attention to human rights than is typical for U.S. visits to autocratic countries with spotty records on free speech, fair trials and other rights.Human rights groups posted concerns about the Gulf countries, but some refrained from more vocal objections. Saudi exiles in the U.S. also skipped the usual pointed comments on social media. And the administration faced few of the typical questions on whether a visiting president had used the trip to press for the release of detained Americans or imprisoned activists.That's partly due to human rights improvements in Saudi Arabia, groups say. But the silence also reflects what some organizations call a worsening human rights picture in the United States.Ibrahim Almadi, a Florida man seeking U.S. help getting his father home from Saudi Arabia, said he tried in vain to score a commitment from a Republican lawmaker or other official to urge Trump to raise his father's cause. His now 75-year-old Saudi American father, Saad Almadi , had been jailed over critical tweets about the Saudi government and now is under an exit ban from the country.""It is a love relationship between Trump and MBS,"" the son said. One mention of the case to Trump, then one comment by Trump to the Saudi crown prince, and ""I will have my father back.""Some voices have gone silentSome Saudis who fled to the U.S. say they are pulling back from social media and any public criticism of Saudi officials, fearing the same detentions and deportations faced by some immigrants and pro-Palestinian protesters under the Trump administration.Democracy in the Arab World Now - the nonprofit founded by Jamal Khashoggi, the U.S.-based journalist killed at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul - is advising Arabs with unsettled immigration status in the U.S. to ""be cautious when they travel, to be thoughtful about what they say,"" executive director Sarah Leah Whitson said.The U.S. intelligence community said the crown prince oversaw the 2018 plot, while he has denied any involvement. The killing of Khashoggi, who used his Washington Post column to urge Prince Mohammed to institute reforms, led then-President Joe Biden to pledge to make Saudi royals into pariahs.But soaring U.S. gasoline prices in 2022 spurred Biden to visit the oil-exporting giant, where he had an awkward fist bump with the prince.In his second term, Trump has tightened his embrace of Prince Mohammed and other wealthy Gulf leaders, seeking big investments in the U.S., while Trump's elder sons are developing major real estate projects in the region.The human rights record in Saudi ArabiaBurned by the condemnation and initial isolation over Khashoggi, Prince Mohammed has quietly released some of those imprisoned for seeking women's right to drive, for critical tweets, for publicly proposing Saudi policy changes and more. The prince also has liberalized legal and social conditions for women, part of a campaign to attract business and diversify Saudi Arabia's economy.But many others remain in prison. Thousands, including Almadi, face exit bans, rights groups say.Those organizations cite another reason that activists are staying quieter than usual during the trip: the United States' own human rights reputation.Besides deportations, Whitson pointed to U.S. military support to Israel during its 19-month offensive against Hamas in Gaza, which has killed thousands of civilians. The Trump administration says it's trying to secure a ceasefire.Americans faulting another country's abuses now ""just doesn't pass the laugh test,"" Whitson said. ""The United States does not have the moral standing, the legal standing, the credibility to be chastising another country at this moment in time.""

Former FBI Director James Comey is facing a federal investigation after sharing a controversial photo on Instagram that sparked outrage among Trump allies. The post showed seashells arranged to form the numbers “86 47,” which critics argue was a veiled threat against President Donald Trump, the 47th president of the United States.Comey captioned the image, “Cool shell formation on my beach walk,” but the numbers raised concerns, particularly the use of “86,” which can be slang for “getting rid of” someone. While Merriam-Webster notes the term can mean “to kill” in certain contexts, it has not officially adopted that definition due to its limited use.The post was swiftly deleted after backlash. Comey later clarified that he hadn’t realised the numbers could be interpreted as violent. “I assumed they were a political message,” he wrote, adding, “I oppose violence of any kind, so I took the post down.”Despite the explanation, the reaction from Trump supporters was fierce. Donald Trump Jr. accused Comey of calling for his father’s assassination, calling the post “demented.” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem went further, saying, “Disgraced former FBI Director James Comey just called for the assassination of @POTUS Trump.”Current FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed the agency is cooperating with the US Secret Service in investigating the matter. “Primary jurisdiction is with the Secret Service, and we, the FBI, will provide all necessary support,” Patel said.White House Deputy Chief of Staff James Blair also weighed in, calling the post a “clarion call to terrorists and hostile regimes” while the president is abroad in the Middle East.Comey, who led the FBI from 2013 until he was fired by Trump in 2017, is currently promoting his new crime novel, *FDR Drive*. His tenure at the FBI remains controversial, particularly over his handling of investigations into Hillary Clinton’s emails and alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election neither of which led to charges, though both drew sharp criticism from both political sides.","Former FBI Director James Comey is facing a federal investigation after sharing a controversial photo on Instagram.

The Trump administration is moving to expand its crackdown on illegal immigration, with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) requesting 20,000 National Guard troops to support enforcement operations. A DHS official toldthat the request was made to the Pentagon to help fulfil the President’s pledge to arrest and deport criminal undocumented immigrants. While the Defence Department acknowledged receiving the request, officials said it remains in the early planning stages, with legal reviews ongoing regarding the Guard’s role in interior immigration enforcement.There is uncertainty over whether the National Guard would be used for direct arrests or in a support capacity such as transportation or logistics. It also remains unclear whether President Trump would require state governors to approve the deployment or move to federalise the Guard. The last instance of federalising the National Guard was during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.The move has drawn swift backlash from Democrats. Senator Tammy Duckworth criticised the request as an unprecedented misuse of the military within the US, warning it could set a dangerous precedent.She said deploying the Guard for immigration enforcement undermines national readiness and threatens civil liberties, adding that Trump’s approach risks expanding military authority over civilians.National Guard troops have previously been used at the state level, most notably in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott authorised them to arrest migrants. However, this would be the first instance of a national-level deployment focused on deportations.Alongside the National Guard request, the administration has launched new measures to incentivise voluntary departure. Migrants who agree to self-deport using the “CBP Home” app will be offered $1,000 and free travel. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described this as the safest and most cost-effective option, with flights already departing from cities like Chicago.Critics warn that such departures could undermine legal asylum claims and complicate migrants' ability to return legally in the future. Nevertheless, the White House claims dramatic progress, boasting a 95% reduction in illegal border crossings and declaring the current state of the border the most secure in modern US history.",The request was made to the Pentagon to help fulfil the President’s pledge to arrest and deport criminal undocumented immigrants. There is uncertainty over whether the National Guard would be used for direct arrests or in a support capacity such as transportation or logistics. It also remains unclear whether President Trump would require state governors to approve the deployment.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121199149,imgsize-973336,width-400,resizemode-4/121199149.jpg"

Trump is planning a $45M military parade on his birthday





A massive military parade to mark the 250th anniversary of the US Army , coinciding with US President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday on June 14, is expected to cost between $25 million and $45 million, according to Army officials.As per CBS News, the event is expected to feature more than 100 vehicles, including M1 Abrams tanks, Stryker and Bradley fighting vehicles, and artillery units like Howitzers. It could also involve up to 50 helicopters, requiring “extensive coordination” with the Federal Aviation Administration.The day will conclude with a fireworks display and live performances.Lt Col Ruth Castro, an Army spokesperson, confirmed that around 6,600 to 7,500 soldiers will participate,according to CNBC.Many will arrive days ahead and be housed in federal buildings such as the department of agriculture and a general services administration warehouse in Washington, DC. Soldiers will receive one hot meal, two ready-to-eat meals daily, and $50 in extra pay.The celebration, which includes period uniforms and vintage aircraft flyovers from World War II-era B-17s and P-51 Mustangs, will run from Arlington, Virginia, to the National Mall.The Independent reported that the Army is still struggling to source accurate historical uniforms from the War of 1812 and the Spanish-American War.Trump said, “We’re going to have a big, beautiful parade.” He insisted the event is not tied to his birthday and brushed off concerns over the cost: “It would be peanuts compared to the value of doing it.”As per media reports, the US president’s fascination with military parades likely began after he attended France’s Bastille Day celebrations in 2017, when he said, ""we're going to have to try and top it"". Although he had attempted to organize a similar event in 2018, he cancelled it after the cost was projected at $92 million.He later blamed “local politicians who run Washington, DC, poorly” for inflating the price, as per CBS News.The National Park Service has received permit requests for both the parade and a planned counterprotest. According to The Independent, one application calls the parade “an insult to the American people,” and estimates up to 20,000 demonstrators might attend.Democratic critics, including Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee, have slammed the plan as wasteful. “The egotist-in-chief wants taxpayers to foot the bill for a military parade on his birthday,” Cohen said in a statement.Despite opposition, the event is set to be the grand finale of a weeklong commemoration, with concerts, parachute jumps, military demonstrations, and musical performances, including country music stars, reported The Independent.Fireworks are scheduled for 9:45 pm (local time) on the National Mall.","US President Donald Trump will celebrate his 79th birthday on June 14.

Harvard Law paid $27 for a copy of Magna Carta. Surprise! It’s an original,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harvard-law-paid-27-for-a-copy-of-magna-carta-surprise-its-an-original/articleshow/121198440.cms,"NYT photo





Bought for $27.50 after WWII, the faint, water stained manuscript in the library of Harvard Law School had attracted relatively little attention since it arrived there in 1946.That is about to change.Two British academics, one of whom happened on the manuscript by chance, have discovered it is an original 1300 version — not a copy, as long thought — of Magna Carta, the medieval document that helped establish some of the world’s most cherished liberties. It is one of just seven such documents from that date still in existence.“I never in all my life expected to discover a Magna Carta,” said David Carpenter , professor of medieval history at King’s College London. The manuscript’s value is hard to estimate, although it is fair to say its price tag of under $30 (about $500 today) must make it one of the bargains of the last century. A 710-year-old version was sold in 2007 for $21.3 million.Nicholas Vincent, a professor of medieval history at University of East Anglia, in eastern England, helped authenticate the text. He said the document, which bound the nation’s rulers to acting within the law, had resurfaced at a time when Harvard has come under extraordinary pressure from Trump govt.“In this particular instance, we are dealing with an institution that is under direct attack from the state itself, so it’s almost providential. ...”Providential or not, the discovery happened largely by chance. Carpenter was plowing his way through Harvard Law School’s digital images when he opened a file named HLS MS 172 — catalogue name for Harvard Law School Manuscript 172. “I get down to 172 and it’s a single parchment sheet of Magna Carta,” he said. “And I think ‘Oh my God, this looks to me for all the world... like an original.” He emailed Vincent, who was at work in a library in Brussels. “David sent it with a message saying, ‘What do you think that is?. .. ’” said Vincent. “I wrote back within seconds, saying, ‘You and I both know what that is!’”They were able to confirm its authenticity after Harvard photographed it under ultraviolet light and subjected it to various levels of spectral imaging, a technique which can enhance aspects of historical documents undetectable to the human eye. Comparing it with six previously known originals, they found the text and dimensions matched. The handwriting also tallied. Magna Carta — “Great Charter” in Latin — has been used to justify many different causes over the centuries, sometimes on shaky historical ground. First issued in 1215, the document put into writing a set of concessions won by rebellious barons from a recalcitrant King John of England.It influenced the US Constitution. Harvard bought its version from a London book dealer, which had purchased it in Dec 1945 from Sotheby’s.","Two British academics, one of whom happened on the manuscript by chance, have discovered it is an original 1300 version.

Suspected relationship with Michael B. Jordan

Kid Cudi's car 'blowing up'

'Freak-offs'





Britney Spears and Michael B. Jordan were unexpectedly drawn into Sean ""Diddy"" Combs’ sex-trafficking trial this week, as Cassie Ventura, the rapper’s former longtime girlfriend, continued her gripping testimony in a New York courtroom.Ventura, who dated Combs for more than a decade, was being cross-examined by the defence as she detailed incidents from their turbulent relationship. Her account came amid intense questioning by Combs’ legal team, who were attempting to challenge her version of events.During cross-examination on Thursday, Cassie told the court that Diddy had invited Spears to her 21st birthday party in Las Vegas, the same night he first kissed her. “Sean was there and he brought [music producer] Dallas Austin, Britney Spears,” she said, according to the New York Post. “I think those were the two people that stand out to me.”At the time, their relationship was said to be platonic. However, Cassie testified that Diddy’s sudden kiss during the celebration at Jet Nightclub in The Mirage Hotel left her in tears. “I was just really confused at the time,” she said. “I was a young, new artist who just didn’t really know the lay of the land when it came to things like that.”Photos from the 2007 party also show Paris Hilton in attendance. Rapper 50 Cent hosted another event the same night at the Hard Rock Hotel, where Diddy’s group later arrived. 50 Cent hasn’t commented on the party connection since the court proceedings began.Cassie also revealed that Combs once suspected her of having an affair with actor Michael B. Jordan. Under questioning from Combs’ lawyer, Cassie confirmed that the mogul had confronted her over alleged involvement with Jordan while she was filming in South Africa in 2016.“Mr. Combs suspected you of a relationship with whom?” the lawyer asked. Cassie answered, “Michael B. Jordan.”Just a day before these revelations, Cassie had dropped another bombshell: Diddy allegedly made threats against rapper Kid Cudi and later, Cudi’s car exploded in his driveway. “He mentioned when we were out of the country that Scott’s car would be blown up and he wanted his friends to see it,” she said in court.When they later bumped into Cudi at SoHo House in New York, Cassie said the rapper asked Combs about the threat. Combs responded casually, “What vehicle?” and moved on.Cassie described how Combs went through her phone during one of the so-called freak-offs and found out about her contact with Cudi. She said Combs became jealous, lunged at her with a corkscrew and kicked her in the back as she left his home. The court was shown photos of her bruises, taken by her mother.Cassie, who is now eight months pregnant with her third child, has accused Combs of years of abuse during their 11-year relationship. She has testified that she was coerced into sex parties involving male sex workers, which Combs referred to as “freak-offs.” She also accused him of raping her in 2018.Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and transporting women for prostitution. If convicted, he could face a life sentence.","Britney Spears and Michael B. Jordan were unexpectedly drawn into Sean ""Diddy"" Combs’ sex-trafficking trial this week.

Pakistan envoy honeytrapped in Bangladesh? Sudden exit after viral videos sparks row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-envoy-honeytrapped-in-bangladesh-sudden-exit-after-viral-videos-sparks-row/articleshow/121164452.cms,"



Pakistan’s high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof , has abruptly gone on leave after videos of his alleged honeytrap surfaced online, according to Bangladeshi daily Prothom Alo.Maroof left Dhaka on the morning of 11 May, travelling to Islamabad via Dubai. That same day, the Pakistan high commission in Dhaka formally notified Bangladesh’s ministry of foreign affairs of his departure, a senior ministry official told Prothom Alo on Tuesday.Diplomatic sources in Dhaka suggest that Maroof’s recall may be linked to controversy surrounding a personal visit to Cox’s Bazar during the recent India-Pakistan conflict, and his alleged association with a female Bangladeshi government official, Daily Sun reported.Under diplomatic protocol, when an ambassador takes leave, the host country’s foreign ministry is informed of the duration and who will assume responsibilities in the interim. While the Pakistan high commission confirmed that deputy high commissioner Muhammad Asif will serve as acting high commissioner, no timeframe for Maroof’s leave was provided in official communication, Prothom Alo noted.Maroof had played a high-profile role in Dhaka and Islamabad ties, particularly following the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government on 5 August 2024, in the wake of a student-led uprising.Rumours of the scandal escalated after photos and alleged intimate videos surfaced online, showing Maroof with a Bangladeshi woman. This also led to speculation that the envoy had been honey-trapped.","Pakistan’s high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof, has abruptly gone on leave after videos of his alleged honeytrap surfaced online.

NEW DELHI: Early in March, the US arrested in Afghanistan an ISIS-K operative involved in the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 Marines. President Donald Trump was quick to thank Pakistan for its help in nabbing the high-value fugitive from the Pak-Afghan border. ""I want to thank the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster,"" he told US Congress.But what was brushed under the carpet was an open secret in intelligence circles: The operative, Sharifullah, had been in Pakistan spy agency ISI's custody for over a year. ISI ran multiple operations using his network and ultimately handed him over to the CIA at the right time - when the regime changed in Washington.This was not the first instance of Pakistan trying to please the US by handing over terrorists that it had been using to achieve its own goals. ISI had played the same trick in 2010 when it 'suddenly discovered' Taliban military commander Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and handed him over to CIA.The case of Osama bin Laden and his courier, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, further exposed the duplicity of Pakistan and its military-industrial complex. Pakistani intelligence agencies had claimed they had no knowledge of Osama's presence in Abbottabad despite the compound where he was staying being just about a kilometre away from the Pakistan Military Academy.The Americans, it appears, didn't believe the Pakistanis and kept on hunting for the 9/11 plotter.But while his capture and killing vindicated the US's lack of trust in Islamabad, American leaders continued to allow themselves to be baited by the Pakistanis. Trump, who considers himself to be the greatest deal maker, seems to be the latest victim of Pakistan's dual game, feeling beholden to the favour that ISI did by offering Sharifullah as a trophy.Sharifullah and Osama are not standalone cases. In 2002, a bombing at nightclubs in Bali had left over 200 people dead, including several Americans. The prime suspect was Umar Patek, a suspected member of the militant group Jemaah Islamiyah. The US had announced a $1 million bounty on him.On January 25, 2011, Patek was dramatically captured by Pakistani officials in Abbottabad and handed over to the US, which then passed him on to Indonesia as a gesture which ""demonstrated the international cooperation between the US and Indonesia in addressing terrorism"". Pakistan had similarly arrested Osama's man Friday Abu Zubaydah in Faisalabad six months after the 9/11 attacks. He was swiftly transferred to CIA custody.These capture-extraditions, though seen as attempts by Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to counter-terrorism, have actually been selective and strategic, aimed at appeasing the US rather than genuinely combating terrorism, a senior officer said.","US arrested in Afghanistan an ISIS-K operative involved in the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 Marines.
