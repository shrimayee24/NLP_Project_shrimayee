Mauritius' tribute to Indian culture



Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Mauritius on Tuesday for a two-day visit, marking a return to a country he first visited 27 years ago. His arrival was met with a warm welcome from the Indian diaspora, including a traditional Bihari cultural performance known as Geet Gawai.""Deeply touched by the warm welcome from the Indian community in Mauritius.

He also met Paul Raymond Bérenger, who later became Prime Minister.PM Modi's 1998 visit also reinforced his understanding of Mahatma Gandhi’s influence in Mauritius. At a Gandhi Jayanti event, he witnessed how deeply the Mauritian people revered the Mahatma and how their independence movement was inspired by India's own struggle against colonial rule.In a speech at the World Hindi Secretariat Building in 2015, PM Modi recalled how the newspaper 'Hindustani', published in three languages—Gujarati, Hindi, and English—became a unifying force in Mauritius.""2nd October is still being celebrated in Mauritius. The kind of celebration they have, even we do not have. There is a tremendous sense of belonging,"" PM Modi said, recalling his experience.During his 1998 visit, PM Modi also visited the sacred Ganga Talao, a crater lake revered by Hindus in Mauritius. He noted how Mauritians had poured water from the Ganges into the lake, deepening its spiritual significance.Speaking at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas in 2015, PM Modi said, ""If there is one place that unites all of Mauritius, it is Ganga Sagar... Though the quantity of water may be small, the emotions and devotion associated with it have given it a different dimension.""Seventeen years later, in 2015, PM Modi returned to Ganga Talao, offering flowers to Maa Ganga once again.Such is the deep-rooted connection between the two nations that on January 22, 2024, when the consecration of the Ram Temple took place in Ayodhya, the Mauritian government granted special leave to Hindu public servants to attend prayers.Hindus comprise around 48% of Mauritius' population, and the island has long maintained close cultural and historical ties with India.PM Modi’s visit reaffirms India’s deep-rooted bond with Mauritius, extending beyond diplomacy to shared heritage, history, and emotions.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Mauritius on Tuesday for a two-day visit.

NEW DELHI: The Codava National Council has urged Union home minister Amit Shah and Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara to ensure the safety of actress Rashmika Mandanna after state-ruling Congress MLA Ravi Kumar Gowda (Ganiga) and Kannada activist TA Narayana Gowda targeted her for identifying herself as ""being from Hyderabad rather than Karnataka.""In a letter to the ministers, CNC president N U Nachappa accused the MLA that Rashmika is being ""bullied and intimidated by a legislator,"" also calling it an act of "" hooliganism "" against a member of the Indigenous Codava tribal race.Nachappa also highlighted Rashmika’s achievements in the Indian film industry, where she has worked with actors like Amitabh Bachchan and Salman Khan, crediting her success to hard work and talent. He stressed that she has the right to make personal choices without coercion.""The CNC emphasises that Rashmika's freedom to make her own choices should be respected and that she should not be forced to comply with the whims of the legislature.

Survivor asked to appear before medical board today



JAIPUR: A single-judge bench of Rajasthan high court has permitted a 13-year-old rape survivor to undergo medical termination of her pregnancy of 27 weeks and six days. The court said if the fetus survives, the hospital should make arrangements for incubation, and the child should be brought up at the expense of the state govt. In case of the fetus’s death, the court mandated preservation of the DNA test report.An FIR of rape was registered on March 3 after the girl’s pregnancy was discovered in hospital. The girl and her family said the accused threatened her to keep quiet.The rape survivor has been asked to appear before the medical board with parents on Wednesday.Justice Sudesh Bansal instructed the medical superintendent of Mahila Chikitsalya at Sanganeri Gate, Jaipur, to make arrangements for the procedure. The petitioner’s counsel Sonia Shandilya said, “The petitioner is a minor girl whose parents, too, have given consent for termination of the pregnancy. The parents are agreeable to high risk of surgical intervention. We maintained that it would be gravely injurious to her mental health if her pregnancy is not allowed to be terminated.”The petitioner added, “We told the court that there are many cases where the high courts and SC have allowed abortion even for a 28-week (7-month) pregnant woman.”Under the MTP Act , any married woman, rape survivor, disabled woman and minor girl is allowed to abort pregnancy up to 24 weeks.","A single-judge bench of Rajasthan high court has permitted a 13-year-old rape survivor to undergo medical termination of her pregnancy.

Don ‘tied’ to NTPC DGM murder killed by cops during escape bid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/don-tied-to-ntpc-dgm-murder-killed-by-cops-during-escape-bid/articleshow/118907249.cms,"Security personnel at the site where gangster Aman Sahu (inset) was killed, in Jharkhand’s Palamu on Tuesday. Sahu’s aides tried to free him by hurling bombs at the prison van taking him to Ranchi from Raipur

DALTONGANJ/RANCHI/HAZARIBAG: Three days after motorcycle-borne men gunned down a senior NTPC official in Hazaribag, a Jharkhand police anti-terrorist squad killed self-styled don Aman Sahu, whose gang was among those suspected to be behind the official’s murder.Witnesses and police said while Sahu, 30, was being brought to Ranchi from Chhattisgarh’s Raipur jail to appear in an ongoing NIA court case, a shootout ensued when his accomplices tried to free him by hurling bombs at the prison van transporting him.All MLAs, cutting across party lines, said Sahu deserved to die, while govt said in the assembly that the circumstances leading to the encounter would be investigated. “Police have the right to retaliate in self-defence. Tuesday’s encounter is also a message to other criminals that the state govt will not tolerate them,” state minister Sudivya Kumar said. Though leader of opposition Babulal Marandi backed the police and said it should not sit idle when shot at, former CM Champai Soren, however, criticised the police for failing to ensure Sahu’s security and demanded a CBI probe. “Sahu would have revealed the truth and that was why he was killed,” he claimed.Sahu’s family members, including his gangster brother Aakash who is currently in jail, countered police version through his counsel and claimed that encounter was stage-managed. The incident took place nearly 173 km from Ranchi.Palamu SP Reeshma Ramesan said the hurling of bombs at the van created an abrupt commotion and Sahu snatched a rifle from ATS havildar Rakesh Kumar and fired at him. “The cop was also injured in the grappling incident and was later admitted to Daltonganj medical college with an abrasion on his thigh. Sahu paid with his life in retaliatory action. The rear glass pane of the van ferrying Sahu was totally destroyed by the bombs,” Ramesan said.Said to be connected to gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, Sahu was also likely to be questioned about involvement in the killing of NTPC official Kumar Gaurav and shooting at a Ranchi-based coal trader last week for extortion. His operations, mainly murders, shooting warnings and extortion, stretched beyond Jharkhand to West Bengal and Chhattisgarh.Aman Sahu, who had 130 cases against him, was tied with ropes and handcuffed when his accomplices hurled two bombs at the police van at about 9.15 am at Anharee Dhounra, 16 km from Daltonganj town, Palamu district .“Aakash, who applied for bail soon after the encounter to attend his brother’s last rites, expressed fear that he, too, may be eliminated similarly. Appearing in his bail hearing online, Aakash also expressed concern for the safety of his family members,” Hemant Shikarwar, Akash’s counsel, said.Later, Ramesan said a magisterial inquiry would be conducted since Sahu was on judicial transit remand. “We will be sending a report about the encounter to the NHRCwithin two days,” the SP said.","Self-styled don Aman Sahu was among those suspected to be behind NTPC official's murder.

MUMBAI: A “professor” of a private Haryana university who was taking seven Punjab and Haryana youths with him to the UK, purportedly for a student exchange programme , was arrested at Mumbai international airport on Monday on suspicion of submitting false information to obtain visas.Police said prima facie, it appears to be a human trafficking case. The seven youths were initially detained by police but subsequently released on court orders. Three of them are minors.“We are yet to verify if the professor is associated with the Haryana-based university, as he claims. He has produced his identity card, but its authenticity needs to be verified,” said a police officer.While an FIR was registered by Sahar police, the case was later transferred to the property cell for investigation.Around 12.30am on Monday, two youths approached the immigration counter at Mumbai airport and produced their passports and visas for verification, as per routine procedure. They had visit visas for the UK.They told the officer manning the counter that they were students of a Haryana-based university and were bound for London with their professor for a student exchange programme. The officer then enquired what course they were studying at the private Haryana university and which varsity in London they were headed to. The duo couldn’t come up with a satisfactory response. The officer alerted his superiors and they found five more youths at other immigration counters also headed for London with the same “professor”.On being quizzed, the “professor” claimed he was acting at the behest of two colleagues who were vocation heads at the Haryana university. Earlier, he had a meeting at a hotel in Delhi with an agent named Bittu and the seven youths who wished to settle in the UK. Bittu had charged each of the youths Rs 20 lakh. He procured visas for the group after allegedly presenting false details about a student exchange programme in the UK, police said. The “professor” then brought the seven youths from Delhi to Mumbai and was set to fly with them to London via Jeddah. Police said the parents of the minors have been informed.","Police said prima facie, it appears to be a human trafficking case.

Mistaking a police team rushing in to nab a wanted criminal for a raid on their gambling activity, two of six gamblers jumped into Tapi River in Surat in a bid to escape but drowned on Tuesday.Unaware of the gambling, cops were raiding the area in Iqbalnagar to apprehend one Rashid Khan, who was later nabbed.A cop said, “Our surveillance team got a tip-off about Rashid Khan’s presence in Iqbalnagar. As our team reached the riverbank, we noticed commotion, with people running helter-skelter. While moving towards the noise, we spotted two men struggling in the river.”Realising that the men were stuck in the river’s thick mud, cops deployed fishermen and swimmers for rescue. “The river was at high tide and filled with heavy silt. Swimmers somehow managed to pull Md Safeda (52) and Md Amin Hotelwala (50) out. Emergency medical teams arrived promptly and rushed them to the hospital, where they were declared dead,” the police officer added.","Unaware of the gambling, cops were raiding the area in Iqbalnagar to apprehend one Rashid Khan, who was later nabbed.

Jaffar Express hijacked

NEW DELHI: Following the deadly attack on the Jaffar Express in Balochistan, former Jammu and Kashmir director general of police (DGP) SP Vaid has claimed that Pakistan's government and military have lost control over the region.""Pakistan's army and government have no control over Balochistan. In such a situation, it is not surprising that all this is happening. Pakistan is on the verge of breaking up,"" he said.He further pointed out that just days ago, various militant organisations in Balochistan and Sindh joined forces to challenge the sovereignty of the Pakistani government and army. ""I will not be surprised if Pakistan breaks into four pieces,"" he added.Speaking on the ongoing insurgency, Vaid elaborated how Pakistan’s Senate member Maulana Fazlur Rehman had earlier admitted that six to seven districts in Balochistan were entirely under the control of terrorists.Echoing similar concerns, retired Indian Army officer Major General GD Bakshi said that Balochistan had slipped out of Pakistan’s control, exposing the weakness of its military. He described the train attack as a major development that revealed deep-seated instability.""The train hijack in Balochistan is very significant. A train has 450-500 people, and they have taken them as hostages. Hostage rescue is a very delicate operation, and I don’t think the Pakistan Army can carry it out without major casualties. These are precision operations that our NSG does well, but the Pakistani army's approach is crude, often relying on heavy artillery.""Bakshi also suggested that the Baloch insurgency had reached a tipping point, with militant groups openly challenging the state. ""I think the time for the birth of Balochistan has come,"" he said, warning that the Pakistan Army may resort to drastic measures to divert attention from its failures.""We have to remain careful at our borders because the Pak Army may do anything to shift focus"", he added.The crisis in Balochistan escalated on Tuesday when the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) derailed the Jaffar Express in Bolan, attacking the train and taking over 100 passengers hostage. The group claimed to have killed 20 Pakistani soldiers and even shot down a military drone.According to a statement by the BLA, ""Among the hostages are active-duty personnel from the Pakistani military, police, Anti-Terrorism Force (ATF), and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), all of whom were traveling to Punjab on leave. If the Pakistani forces attempt any military intervention, all hostages will be executed.""The Baloch insurgency has been a long-running issue, with separatist groups demanding independence and greater control over the province’s rich natural resources. With the latest train attack, tensions have further intensified, raising concerns over Pakistan’s ability to maintain its territorial integrity.","Pakistan's army and government have no control over Balochistan, says ex-J&K DGP.

What is the row over Mahmoud Khalil? What we know so far

Right-wing commentator and writer Ann Coulter questioned the arrest and the following discussion over the possibility of deporting Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University student who was arrested for pro-Palestinian protests on campuses last year. Khalil was arrested by the ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) over the weekend and even President Donald Trump made a social media post mentioning Khalil's name -- blowing the issue out of proportion as his administration is trying to make an example out of Khalil. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said visas or green cards of such Hamas supporters will be revoked so that they can be deported.Khalil's lawyer Amy Greer said Khalil is a green card holder and he was arrested even after she mentioned the legality of his citizenship to the administration.“There’s almost no one I don’t want to deport, but unless they’ve committed a crime, isn’t this a violation of the First Amendment?” Coulter said on the social platform X in response to a report from the New York Post. The First Amendment is the right to free speech.After Ann Coulter's post, social media users noted that even Ann Coulter, known for her hard-line anti-migration stance, is uneasy with the Trump administration's plan to deport a green card holder.Mahmoud Khalil completed his master's degree from Columbia University in December. Before Columbia, he held multiple roles in international development including with the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. He studied for his bachelor's degree in computer science from Lebanese American University, Beirut. Born in Syria, Khalil is a green card holder and is a US citizen, married to an American.Khalil was at the forefront of the pro-Palestine protests that rocked the campuses last year. He was suspended by his university and was then reinstated.Trump said Khalil's arrest is the first arrest of many to come. ""Following my previously signed Executive Orders, ICE proudly apprehended and detained Mahmoud Khalil, a Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student on the campus of Columbia University. This is the first arrest of many to come. We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it,"" Trump wrote.A federal judge in New York blocked the Trump administration's effort to deport Mahmoud Khalil for the time being -- until the court's next order.",Right-wing commentator and writer Ann Coulter questioned the arrest and the following discussion over the possibility of deporting Mahmoud Khalil.

Former TV star Wendy Williams , who was diagnosed with dementia and stays at a New York assisted living facility, was taken away by an ambulance Monday after the cops were called following Williams' plea for help from the window of her room. According to reports, she tossed a handwritten note out of the window begging for help. ""Help! Wendy!"" the note said.

I can call you, but you can’t call me,"" she said during a recent interview with TMZ.""This system has failed from top to bottom regarding this guardianship and everybody involved with that. The system failed. I want my freedom back.""Williams says she had a falling out with her son, who allegedly exploited her for financial gain.""My son, he overstepped his boundaries in terms of me. He overstepped his boundaries and he was inappropriately using my money without telling me crap about it.""The Wendy Williams Show first premiers in 2008 and it ran until 2022 when the show was canceled owing to Williams' physical and mental health struggles. In an interview last month, Wendy Williams said she lives on a floor that is called the ""memory unit"" as the people who live there don't remember anything. She, however, said she does not have dementia.Earlier this year, Williams fitted her court-appointed attorney and said she regained the capacity to function on her own without her legal guardian Sabrina Morrissey. In November, Sabrina claimed in the court that Williams was permanently incapacitated by the early onset of dementia.","Wendy Williams was taken away by an ambulance Monday after the cops were called following Williams' plea for help from the window of her room.

Who are Baloch?

What is Balochistan Liberation Army?

A passenger train, Jaffar Express, was attacked in southwestern Pakistan's Balochistan province on Tuesday, injuring the train driver and leading to hundreds of passengers being taken hostage. The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist group seeking independence for Balochistan, claimed responsibility for the attack. According to a report by Reuters, the group also stated that it had killed 20 soldiers and shot down a drone.In a statement, the BLA said, ""The Baloch Liberation Army has carried out a strategic operation in Mashkaf, Dhadar, Bolan, seizing control of the Jaffar Express by derailing it.""Also read: Opened fire, blew up track: How BLA militants hijacked train in Pakistan's Balochistan The Baloch people are an ethnic group spread across Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan. The region they inhabit, covering parts of all three countries, is about the size of France. The Pakistani province of Balochistan is the largest section, followed by Iran’s Sistan and Balochistan province. The region is mountainous and arid, with a sparse population of approximately nine million Balochs, who are primarily organized into tribes rather than identifying with a single nation-state.The BLA has accused Pakistan of annexing Balochistan against the will of its people, claiming that the region's former ruler, the Khan of Kalat, was forced to sign the instrument of accession in March 1948. The group, which is classified as a terrorist organization by both the US and Pakistan, has waged a long-running insurgency against the Pakistani government, demanding independence for Balochistan, a province rich in natural resources.The militants argue that the federal government exploits Balochistan’s mineral and oil wealth while the ethnic Baloch population faces marginalization and economic hardship. Meanwhile, security forces operating in the region have been accused of human rights violations and enforced disappearances targeting the Baloch community.A decades-long insurgency in Balochistan by separatist militant groups has led to frequent attacks against the government, army and Chinese interests in the region, pressing demands for a share in mineral-rich resources. The BLA seeks independence for Balochistan. It is the biggest of several ethnic insurgent groups that have battled the South Asian nation's government for decades, saying it unfairly exploits Balochistan's rich gas and mineral resources.The recent rise in terrorism in Pakistan has been largely driven by increased activity from Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which is aligned with the Afghan Taliban. The number of deaths linked to the group nearly doubled between 2023 and 2024. In 2024, the TTP carried out 482 attacks, resulting in 558 fatalities, making it the third deadliest terrorist organization globally. This escalation follows a period of reduced activity between 2017 and 2021. The number of attacks attributed to the TTP reached a record high in 2024, with fatalities at their highest level since 2011. The group's operations are mainly concentrated along Pakistan's northern border with Afghanistan, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where 96 percent of its attacks took place.As per a report by Global Terrorism Index 2025, the four terrorist groups responsible for the most deaths globally in 2024 were Islamic State (IS), Jamaat Nusrat Al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM), Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and al-Shabaab.The Global Terrorism Index 2025 report also noted that Pakistan recorded the second-largest increase in terrorism deaths in 2024, with the toll rising by 45 per cent to 1,081.","The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack. The group also stated that it had killed 20 soldiers and shot down a drone. The BLA has waged a long-running insurgency against the Pakistani government. It is demanding independence for Balochistan, a province rich in natural resources.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118896489,imgsize-172870,width-400,resizemode-4/118896489.jpg"
US Canada Tariff War: 'I apologize to the American people': Ontario premier says as Donald Trump escalates tariff war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-apologize-to-the-american-people-ontario-premier-says-as-donald-trump-escalates-tariff-war/articleshow/118900500.cms,"Tariff vs tariff

Threats backfire but for whom



'Be 51st state'



'Canada will pay financial price so big...'

Ontario premier Doug Ford whose electricity tariff threat provoked President Donald Trump to double his planned tariffs on steel and aluminium from 25 per cent to 50 per cent for Canada apologized to the American people as he announced that he would not back down. “We will not back down. We will be relentless. I apologize to the American people that President Trump decided to have an unprovoked attack on our country, on our families, on jobs, and it’s unacceptable. Let’s work together,” Ford said appearing on MSNBC after Trump's mega tariff war.“Believe me when I say I do not want to do this, I feel terrible for the American people, because it’s not the American people who started this trade war. It’s one person who’s responsible. That’s President Trump.”Canada supplies half of US aluminium imports and 20 per cent of US steel imports. Trump announced that he would increase tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports by an additional 25 per cent for a total of 50 per cent duties on those commodities for the neighbor.Ford Monday said he would impose a 25 per cent surcharge on electricity exports to three US states New York, Minnesota and Michigan as the tariff war has been continuing since Donald Trump took office is showing no sign of de-escalating. Canada now has a new prime minister but Trump wants Canada to become the 51st state. Ford earlier said he would shut off the power to the US if this continues.Ford's threats backfired as Trump announced new tariffs but US markets too bore the brunt of the tariff war amid recession apprehension. Trump said he will be declaring a National Emergency on Electricity in those three states so that US can quickly do what has to be done to alleviate the abusive threat from Canada.The tariff war started as Trump accused Canada of doing nothing to arrest the free flow of drugs and illegal migrants through the border. But Trump in his latest threat reiterated that the solution lies in Canada becoming the 51st state of the United States -- which started as a Mar-a-Lago dinner table joke but has now become an issue of grave concern.""The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State. This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear. Canadians’ taxes will be very substantially reduced, they will be more secure, militarily and otherwise, than ever before, there would no longer be a Northern Border problem, and the greatest and most powerful nation in the World will be bigger, better and stronger than ever — And Canada will be a big part of that. The artificial line of separation drawn many years ago will finally disappear, and we will have the safest and most beautiful Nation anywhere in the World — And your brilliant anthem, “O Canada,” will continue to play, but now representing a GREAT and POWERFUL STATE within the greatest Nation that the World has ever seen!"" Trump reiterated.In his threat, Trump wondered why the United States allows Canada to supply electricity even for the three states. ""Who made these decisions, and why? And can you imagine Canada stooping so low as to use ELECTRICITY, that so affects the life of innocent people, as a bargaining chip and threat? They will pay a financial price for this so big that it will be read about in History Books for many years to come!"" Trump said.","'We will not back down. We will be relentless. I apologize to the American people that President Trump decided to have an unprovoked attack on our country, on our families, on jobs, and it’s unacceptable,' Ford said. Ford's threats backfired as Trump announced new tariffs but US markets too bore the brunt of the tariff war.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118900626,imgsize-913253,width-400,resizemode-4/118900626.jpg"

BERHAMPURBibhas Nayak was known for his kindness, faith, and adventurous spirit. The 29-year-old, who worked as an HR manager at St Stephen’s Hospital in New Delhi, had travelled across India on his bicycle.But his final act of bravery came at Sanapur village in Karnataka’s Koppal district, close to the tourist site of Hampi, where he lost his life trying to protect two women from sexual assault.Bibhas was flung into a canal on the night of March 6 while defending the women from three attackers. His body was found Saturday and Karnataka police have since arrested the suspects. His family, still in shock, called for a fair investigation.“He had last visited Kandhamal around three months ago,” said his cousin Firoz Pradhan, who runs a business in Odisha. “A travel enthusiast, he had travelled to many states on his bicycle.”Originally from Derabadi village in Odisha’s Kandhamal district, Bibhas was the son of BK Nayak, bishop of Agra diocese and moderator of Church of North India (CNI) Synod. He attended Stewart School in Bhubaneswar before moving to Chennai for higher studies. He earned a BBA from Madras Christian College and later completed an MBA in Mumbai.Unmarried and passionate about travel, Bibhas had befriended the survivors of the attack during his visit to Karnataka, according to family sources. On the night of the crime, he and four others — an Israeli woman, a man from the US, another from Maharashtra, and their female homestay operator — were stargazing near a canal.When the three men attacked, Bibhas intervened. But the attackers overpowered him and threw him into the water. While his two male companions managed to escape, he drowned.His death has left a deep void among family, friends, and colleagues.“Bibhas was not just a leader’s son; he was a true embodiment of Christian values,” said a church member who knew him well. His colleagues remembered him as a humble and god-fearing man who carried a gentle spirit and a compassionate heart.“We are all in shock. While we’re unaware of the progress of the investigation by Karnataka police, we hope justice will be served,” cousin Pradhan said.His funeral was held Sunday in Kandhamal’s G Udayagiri town, where family and community members gathered to mourn. “We can only pray that such crimes never happen again,” his brother-in-law Akash Paul said.",Bibhas Nayak was flung into a canal on the night of March 6 while defending the women from three attackers.

An Indian origin, former People's Association (PA) youth worker, received a 10-year and six-month prison sentence for sexually assaulting a 16-year-old boy in Singapore.The judgment dated March 3 revealed that the accused, Ranjeet Prasad , exploited the teenager's aspirations of becoming a performer. The incidents occurred in 2007.The court found Prasad guilty of three counts of carnal intercourse against nature's order, with the prosecution noting his complete lack of remorse.District Judge John Ng considered the accused's abuse of authority in the sentencing.The judge noted the incidents' adverse effects on the victim's life, stating: ""He had a girlfriend at that point in time, and the incidents had left him questioning his sexual orientation and prospects for marriage.""The initial meeting between Prasad and the teen occurred in 2007 at a Paya Lebar office. A gag order protects the victim's identity.At the time, Prasad managed PA's community projects in the South East and North West community development councils (CDCs), overseeing the South East CDC's youth network programme.The victim testified about his enthusiasm for joining the youth network's modelling opportunities, aligning with his entertainment industry ambitions.During a later meeting, Prasad discussed the victim's modelling potential and expressed interest in working with him.After obtaining the victim's contact details, Prasad began messaging him.Prasad enquired about the victim's boundaries and previous sexual experiences. The victim responded negatively and reported feeling confused. Later, Prasad invited him to his office. The teen accepted, anticipating potential career opportunities.The victim initially dismissed Prasad's sexual enquiries as harmless.At the office, Prasad discussed photo shoots and being 'adventurous' before taking the teen to a public toilet, where he compelled the boy to perform a sexual act.A subsequent meeting was arranged in Lavender. The victim agreed, still hoping for professional opportunities. Instead, Prasad took him to a hotel and initiated sexual activities. The victim felt compelled to comply. Prasad forced the victim to perform sexual acts and then assaulted him.On July 24, 2018, the victim contacted Prasad, then PA's head of youth and sports, via Facebook Messenger, seeking a meeting. The victim wanted to confront Prasad about the impact of his actions. After a brief phone conversation, Prasad blocked the victim on social media.On May 30, 2020, the victim emailed Prasad's work address about the sexual incidents. Receiving no response, the victim filed a police report on August 24, 2020. During proceedings, the accused, represented by Martin De Cruz, denied all charges, but Judge Ng found the victim's account credible.The judge noted the victim's detailed recollection of events.Judge Ng determined the victim had no motivation to fabricate accusations. The victim's religious background prevented earlier disclosure of the abuse. In his sentencing remarks, Judge Ng emphasised the severity of exploiting a young person.""The acts of the accused and the manner of luring the victim with the promise of a bright future revealed a highly corruptive influence being exerted by the accused to achieve his lascivious aims. This is particularly aggravating,"" he stated.Prasad is contesting both conviction and sentence.PA expressed serious concern about Prasad's offences, emphasising their staff's obligation to maintain public service standards.The organisation confirmed placing Prasad on leave immediately after his arrest.PA suspended Prasad in early September 2020 and terminated his employment on October 23, 2024, following his conviction.","Ranjeet Prasad, a former People's Association (PA) youth worker, received a 10-year and six-month prison sentence for sexually assaulting a 16-year-old boy.

Doctors confirmed she suffered from anorexia nervosa, a severe eating disorder characterized by an intense fear of gaining weight and extreme dietary restrictions.

She was hospitalized at Thalassery Cooperative Hospital for 10 days, where her condition worsened, leading to ventilator support four days before her death.

Medical reports revealed she was severely underweight, with dangerously low blood pressure, pulse, blood sugar, and electrolyte levels, causing damage to internal organs.

Her tragic death has raised concerns over the dangers of unregulated online health advice and the impact of social media on young individuals' body image and eating habits.

When Self doubled down and again referred to her as “Mr. McBride,” Keating pushed back. ""Mr. Chairman, you are out of order,"" Keating said. ""Have you no decency?""Self dismissed the objection and attempted to move on, but Keating refused, saying, ""You will not continue it with me unless you introduce a duly elected representative the right way."" Following this, Self abruptly ended the session.Later, Self defended his actions on social media, claiming his refusal to recognise McBride as a woman aligned with a Trump administration policy that says the federal government would only recognise two biological sexes.This is not the first time McBride has faced similar treatment. In February, Rep. Mary Miller (R-Ill.) referred to her as “the gentleman from Delaware” during a House floor speech.

USAID employees told to burn, shred and destroy classified documents

A USAID contractors’ union on Tuesday urged a federal judge to stop the destruction of classified documents after an internal email instructed staff to shred and burn records as the Trump administration dismantles the agency.Judge Carl Nichols has given both sides until Wednesday morning to submit arguments. The union, Personal Services Contractor Association, represents thousands of USAID contractors who were recently fired or furloughed. The group is concerned that the destruction of documents could erase key evidence related to legal challenges against USAID’s shutdown.The email, bearing the name of acting executive secretary Erica Carr, was sent to key personnel. It thanked staff for helping “clear classified safes and personnel documents” at USAID’s Washington headquarters, reported Associated Press. Employees were told to prioritise shredding but use burn bags if shredders became overloaded. Staffers were also told to write ""secret"" on the bag with a marker.The Trump administration has been shutting down USAID, slashing 83% of its foreign aid programs, firing most staff, and closing the agency’s headquarters. The move has triggered lawsuits over the sudden loss of US foreign assistance.Democratic Representative Gregory Meeks criticised the administration, saying the rushed destruction of records could be an attempt to hide wrongdoing. The American Foreign Service Association, which represents USAID employees, has also raised concerns that the documents being destroyed might be linked to lawsuits over mass firings and program terminations.Classified document access has been a contentious issue at USAID. Last month, the Trump administration placed the agency’s top two security officials on leave after they refused to grant access to classified materials for Elon Musk’s government-cutting team.With most of USAID’s staff already dismissed, only a few employees have access to agency records.","USAID employees told to burn, shred and destroy classified documents.

ICC investigation and Duterte’s defence

A plane carrying former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte departed Manila on Tuesday night, bound for The Hague, where he is set to face charges at the International Criminal Court (ICC). Duterte was arrested, and accused of crimes against humanity over his deadly war on drugs .At 11.03 pm Tuesday, Duterte’s plane took off from Manila and exited Philippine airspace, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. confirmed. Flight tracking data showed the aircraft was scheduled to make a stop in Dubai before continuing to Rotterdam, the Netherlands.Duterte is now set to be turned over to ICC authorities in The Hague, where he will face trial for crimes against humanity. His legal team continues to challenge the move.The ICC confirmed it had issued an arrest warrant against Duterte over alleged crimes against humanity during his deadly war on drugs. ""Once a suspect is in ICC custody, an initial appearance hearing will be scheduled,"" said ICC spokesman Fadi Abdullah.Duterte was taken into custody at Manila’s international airport on Tuesday morning after returning from a brief trip to Hong Kong with his family. Authorities arrested him on an ICC warrant , which alleges that his anti-drug campaign—carried out both as mayor of Davao City and later as president—led to widespread extrajudicial killings . Estimates of the death toll range from the 6,000 reported by Philippine police to as many as 30,000, according to human rights groups.Duterte appeared visibly irritated as he questioned the legality of his detention. “Show to me now the legal basis for my being here,” he said in a video posted on social media by his daughter, Veronica Duterte. His legal team swiftly petitioned the Supreme Court to block any move to send him to The Hague, arguing that the Philippines is no longer a member of the ICC.The ICC’s warrant, issued on March 7, states that there are “reasonable grounds to believe” Duterte was responsible for crimes against humanity, with the killings described as “both widespread and systematic.” It argued that his arrest was necessary to ensure he appeared before the court, citing concerns that he might obstruct investigations or influence witnesses.Duterte pulled the Philippines out of the ICC in 2019 and has repeatedly dismissed the tribunal’s authority. Speaking in Hong Kong just days before his arrest, he called ICC investigators “sons of whores” but insisted he would “accept it” if detained.The Marcos administration , which has distanced itself from Duterte’s policies, previously stated it would not cooperate with the ICC’s investigation. However, Undersecretary of the Presidential Communications Office Claire Castro acknowledged that if Interpol requested assistance, the government would be “obliged to follow.”","Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested on Tuesday.

Trump's 'maximum pressure' campaign against Iran

President Masoud Pezeshkian of Iran has refused to negotiate a nuclear deal with the United States, days after his US counterpart Donald Trump sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, expressing his willingness to negotiate a deal.In a strong remark, Pezeshkian said Iran would not negotiate while being 'threatened' by the US, and told Trump to 'do whatever the hell you want.'""It is unacceptable for us that they (the US) give orders and make threats. I won’t even negotiate with you (Trump). Do whatever the hell you want,"" Iran's state media quoted Pezeshkian as saying.The Iranian President's statement follows Supreme Leader Khamenei's declaration that they would not be 'bullied' into negotiations.Trump disclosed during a Fox Business interview last week that he had written to Khamenei, and said he hoped Iran would come to the negotiating table or 'it will be very ugly for them.'""The other alternative is we have to do something, because you can't let them have nuclear weapons,"" he added.However, the White House is yet to confirm the specifics of the letter, including whether it was directly addressed to Khamenei.While expressing openness to a deal with Tehran, Trump has reinstated the 'maximum pressure' campaign he applied in his first term to 'isolate' the Islamic Republic from the global economy, and drive its oil exports down towards zero.Iran has long denied wanting to develop a nuclear weapon. However, it has been 'dramatically' accelerating enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% weapons-grade level, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has warned.The Asian nation has accelerated its nuclear work since 2019, a year after then-President Trump ditched Tehran's 2015 nuclear pact with six world powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled the country's economy.(With Reuters inputs)","President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran would not negotiate while being 'threatened' by the US.

These actions will reduce the department's 4,100-strong workforce by half, as reported by AFP.Approximately 1,300 staff members will receive termination notices with a 90-day notice period. Beginning Wednesday, affected employees will work remotely and transition to paid administrative leave from March 21. Affected employees will telework from Wednesday until March 21 ""for safety reasons to protect the 2,183 employees that are going to remain after"" the workforce reduction concludes, according to a senior official. Severance packages will be based on length of service.These reductions follow the dismissal of 63 probationary employees under a recent White House directive. Also, over 300 staff members accepted voluntary separation incentives up to $25,000, whilst about 260 took deferred resignation packages.The department will also close several regional offices, including those in San Francisco and New York, eventually consolidating operations into a single Washington, DC location, where it currently maintains three offices.Additionally, agency representatives clarified that the previous notification to staff regarding temporary office closure, citing unspecified ""security reasons"", was actually related to these layoffs. The internal communication, which CNN accessed, had directed staff members to operate from home until Thursday.As these decisions to cutdown on Education department's workforce were announced, security personnel were observed putting lock on the Department headquarters in Washington, DC, moments before staff evacuation, expecting to resume operations on Thursday.Meanwhile, senior officials assured that federal student aid would remain unaffected, despite experts' concerns about the department's ability to function effectively with such significant staff reductions.The current round of cuts aligns with similar downsizing across federal agencies, part of Trump and Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency's initiative to reduce federal government size.""Today's reduction in force reflects the Department of Education's commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers,"" Education Secretary Linda McMahon said. ""I appreciate the work of the dedicated public servants and their contributions to the Department,"" she added.Additionally, addressing Trump's shutdown threats, she added, """"His directive to me, clearly, is to shut down the Department of Education, which we know we'll have to work with Congress, you know, to get that accomplished.""CNN earlier reported that White House officials have drafted an executive order instructing McMahon to begin dismantling the department.A senior agency official stated on Tuesday: ""The president campaigned on bringing substantial reforms to the civil service and to the federal government and this importantly, to send education back to the states and return power to students and families. We are proceeding with a piece of the substantial reforms today.""Veteran department employees told CNN they cannot recall any previous complete office closure, even during high-profile visits.Several Department of Education staff members previously expressed anxiety about potential mass redundancies and Trump's anticipated executive order.The unions representing education workers and teachers promptly criticised the cuts, highlighting concerns about workforce impact and effects on millions of students served by the agency.""What is clear from the past weeks of mass firings, chaos, and unchecked unprofessionalism is that this regime has no respect for the thousands of workers who have dedicated their careers to serve their fellow Americans,"" stated Sheria Smith, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 252.The National Education Association president, Becky Pringle, criticised Trump and Musk's federal government restructuring, stating, ""The real victims will be our most vulnerable students.""","The US Education Department is slashing about half of its workforce and ending leases for regional office properties across major metropolitan areas.

The United States agreed on Tuesday to immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume military assistance to Ukraine after more than eight hours of meetings in Saudi Arabia where Kyiv said it would support the Trump administration’s proposal for a 30-day cease-fire with Russia.The talks in the coastal city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, brought fresh momentum to cease-fire negotiations that faltered following a public confrontation at the White House between the Ukrainian and US presidents.The Trump administration had paused all military assistance and intelligence sharing in the aftermath of the meeting. The announcement came hours after Russian officials said Ukrainian drones targeted Moscow in the largest bombardment of the war. There was no immediate comment from Russia, which did not have officials at the talks.In a joint statement, the US and Ukraine acknowledged that the terms of any cease-fire would be subject Russia’s approval. They also agreed to conclude “as soon as possible” a deal to develop Ukraine’s critical mineral resources — an agreement that was put on hold after the Oval Office dust-up. That joint venture is intended to “expand Ukraine’s economy and guarantee Ukraine’s long-term prosperity and security,” the statement said.It added that the US and Ukraine also discussed humanitarian relief efforts that would take place during a ceasefire and the exchange of prisoners of war. “Representatives of both nations praised the bravery of the Ukrainian people in defense of their nation and agreed that now is the time to begin a process toward lasting peace,” the US and Ukraine said in the statement.The US delegation in Jeddah was led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Michael Waltz, the national security adviser. They met with a delegation from Kyiv led by Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. The intelligence cutoff had already impaired soldiers in combat, particularly in the Kursk region of Russia, where Russian soldiers, aided by fighter from North Korea, have been rapidly advancing, according to Ukrainian commanders in the field.Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is expected to travel later this week to Moscow, where he could meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to a person familiar with the matter but not authorized to comment publicly. The person cautioned that scheduling could change.Earlier in the day, journalists were briefly allowed in a room where a senior Ukrainian delegation met with Rubio, who smiled at the cameras and when asked about his expectations for the meeting, gave a thumbs-up and replied, “Good"".Russian officials said Ukraine attacked Moscow before dawn on Tuesday with its largest long-range drone bombardment of the war, as both sides stepped up attacks ahead of talks intended to find a way to end three years of fighting.The Russian ministry of defence claimed to have shot down at least 91 drones in the region around Moscow and more than 240 drones directed at targets across the country. The Ukrainian military said it had targeted Moscow’s oil refinery, which provides more than a third of the fuel consumed in the capital region, along with an oil production station in the Orel region.Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, called the attack was the largest against the city since the start of the war. At least three people were killed and 18 others were injured in the broader Moscow region, the Russian authorities said, and four international airports temporarily suspended operations. Railway tracks near the Domodedovo airport south of Moscow were also damaged.","Ukraine targets Russia with massive drone strike, 3 die and 18 are injured.

"Trump retreats on doubling steel, aluminium tariffs after Canada backs down on electricity surcharge",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-retreats-on-doubling-steel-aluminium-tariffs-after-canada-backs-down-on-electricity-surcharge/articleshow/118910548.cms,"AP photo

President Trump set to reverse Canadian tariff increases

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday pulled back from his decision to raise tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium from 25% to 50%, said White House trade adviser Peter Navarro , reports Associated Press.The threat was a response to Ontario’s decision to impose surcharges on electricity exports to the US. However, Trump retreated after Ontario Premier Doug Ford agreed to drop the surcharge.""He has to bounce it off the president but I'm pretty confident he will pull back,"" Ford said on Trump's steel and aluminum tariff threat. ""By no means are we just going to roll over. What we are going to do is have a constructive conversation.""The US government, however, is still proceeding with the 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports, adding to economic uncertainty.In a social media post early Tuesday, Trump justified his threat to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium, saying it was a response to Ford’s actions. He also criticised Canada for depending on the US for military protection and repeated his call for the country to become the 51st US state. Trump added that if Canada joined the US, ""all tariffs, and everything else, would totally disappear.""The trade tensions have worsened relations between the US and Canada. Mark Carney , set to replace Justin Trudeau as Canada’s Prime Minister, has pledged to keep tariffs on US goods in place until the US government shows “respect” and commits to free trade. Canada had already imposed $30 billion in retaliatory tariffs on American products, including orange juice, peanut butter, coffee, and appliances.Trump has defended tariffs as a key tool for protecting American industries, but markets have reacted negatively. The stock market has been on a downturn, with the S&P 500 dropping 2.7% on Monday and continuing to slide on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 478 points, further erasing gains from Trump’s 2024 election victory.The tariff strategy has also raised concerns about a potential recession. Harvard economist Larry Summers estimates a 50% chance of an economic downturn, while Goldman Sachs has revised its US growth forecast downward. Trump has downplayed these fears, insisting that tariffs will eventually benefit the US economy by pushing companies to relocate factories to American soil.","President Trump set to reverse Canadian tariff increases.

ISLAMABAD: Global rights organisation Amnesty International called on Pakistan Tuesday to free and drop all charges against minority Ahmadis jailed in recent weeks and ensure adequate protection of their places of worship.In the last two weeks alone, more than 60 Ahmadis, including children, have been detained and their places of worship vandalised in Punjab and Sindh provinces. Police have filed cases against them under section 298-C of Pakistan Penal Code, which bars the community from calling themselves Muslims or preaching their faith.“The disturbing pattern of arbitrary arrests , harassment and violence against Ahmadi community is in violation of their right to freedom of religion and belief. Local authorities in Pakistan must provide adequate protection to Ahmadi places of worship and officials engaged in harassment or destruction of Ahmadi property must be brought to justice,” Amnesty posted on X.In Pakistan, Ahmadis face significant and escalating threat from the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), a far-right Islamist political party known for its hardline stance on blasphemy and its targeting of religious minorities.TLP members have been linked to physical attacks on Ahmadis, desecration of their graves, and demolition of their places of worship. Since the start of this month, TLP members have reportedly attacked 27 Ahmadis in Bahawalnagar, demolished a 120-year-old place of worship in Gujranwala and gathered outside worship sites in cities like Karachi, Sialkot and Jauharabad to prevent Ahmadis from praying, often with police either unable or unwilling to intervene effectively.On March 1, police arrested 22 Ahmadis in Daska region of Sialkot for offering prayers in their religious place. On March 7, over two dozen members of the Ahmadi community, including children, were taken into “protective custody” by law enforcement personnel as a mob gathered outside its place of worship in Surjani, Karachi.Later that day, police registered a criminal case against over two dozen Ahmadi members and arrested six of them on a TLP activist’s complaint in Surjani.The previous day, police booked nine people, two of them Ahmadis, on charges of torturing a TLP activist to death during a scuffle in Bahawalnagar. However, intelligence and police sources suggest the TLP activist’s death was not a result of a fight with Ahmadis. They said the seven people who faced charges of killing a TLP worker were members of Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ). There had been a confrontation between ASWJ activists and TLP members a couple of days back.","In the last two weeks, more than 60 Ahmadis, including children, have been detained and their places of worship vandalised in Punjab and Sindh provinces.

ISLAMABAD: Unidentified gunmen shot dead three migrant barbers inside their shop in Panjgur district of Pakistan’s volatile southwestern Baluchistan province, police said on Monday.Baluchistan has in recent years witnessed a sharp increase in targeted killings of non-Baluch inhabitants, including barbers, commuters, and workers from other provinces, particularly Punjab. Ethnic Baluch separatist militants accuse non-Baluch residents of spying for the Pakistani military, against which they have waged an insurgency.The victims of the latest incident hailed from Mirpurkhas and Jacobabad districts in southern Sindh province“Three Sindhi barbers lost their lives in a targeted attack in Gowargo area of Panjgur district,” Muhammad Zaid, a police officer in Panjgur district, said. The gunmen arrived on a motorbike, entered the barber shop late Sunday evening, opened fire and then fled, police said.The victims’ bodies were moved to a local hospital for post-mortem examinations before being sent to their hometowns.Shahid Rind, Baluchistan govt spokesperson, described the attack as barbaric and intended to sow discord among provinces.No group has claimed the attack. The separatist Baluchistan Liberation Army (BLA) had accepted responsibility for similar attacks in the past. BLA is the most active group in the region; it accuses outsiders of exploiting the rich resources of their province.Last month, militants had executed seven Punjabi labourers after stopping a bus on a highway in Baluchistan and identifying where the passengers were from.Eleven Punjabi labourers were killed after being abducted from a bus in the city of Naushki in April last year, while seven Punjabi barbers were killed a month later near Gwadar Port in the restive province.","Unidentified gunmen shot dead three migrant barbers inside their shop.

A man in Pakistan has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting the admin of a community WhatsApp group who removed him from the chat, police said on Saturday.The shooting took place on Thursday evening in Regi, a locality on the outskirts of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan and has a history of sectarian violence .According to police records and a local official, the suspect, identified as Ashfaq Khan, has been charged with the murder of Mushtaq Ahmed. The dispute began when Mushtaq removed Ashfaq from the WhatsApp group following an argument. Hoping to reconcile, both men agreed to meet, but Ashfaq allegedly arrived with a gun and opened fire, killing Mushtaq on the spot.The police report noted that both men were in the process of reconciliation when the suspect suddenly opened fire. The motive behind the attack was “in reaction to removal from WhatsApp group,” as stated in the report.Humayun Khan, the victim’s brother, told Arab News that he was present at the scene but was unaware of the nature of the dispute.“My slain brother Mushtaq and Ashfaq had developed some differences in a WhatsApp group, forcing my brother to remove the latter. Ashfaq got infuriated and shot my brother dead,” he said. “It was a non-issue or a very trivial matter. No one in our family even knew about the dispute at all.”Local police officer Abid Khan confirmed that Humayun had filed a complaint against Ashfaq, who fled the scene after the attack. Authorities are conducting raids to apprehend him.The incident has triggered widespread reactions on social media, with many expressing sorrow over such violence during the holy fasting month of Ramadan.Easy access to firearms, the influence of tribal customs, and weak law enforcement in the region often contribute to minor disputes spiralling into deadly confrontations.","A man in Pakistan has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting the admin of a community WhatsApp group who removed him from the chat.

KARACHI: Six members of the minority Ahmadi community were arrested by police on Saturday after it earlier provided protective custody to around two dozen of them following threats from a sectarian politico-religious party. The police registered cases against the Ahmadi community members after taking them into protective custody when Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) activists gathered outside their place of worship in Surjani town of Karachi to prevent them from offering ""Friday prayers"".""Today, we arrested six people on the complaint of a TLP activist in Surjani,"" a senior police official said.The approximately 500,000-member Ahmadi community in Pakistan is a religious minority which claims itself as Muslims but was officially declared ""non-Muslim"" in 1974 through an amendment in the constitution.They have faced prosecution from right-wing religious parties notably in the Punjab province in recent times.Amir Mahmood, a community spokesperson, said TLP activists had gathered outside their place of worship since Friday afternoon and threatened to tear it down.DIG West, Irfan Baloch, said the TLP activists demanded the arrest of Ahmadi community leaders and the sealing of their place of worship.Ahmadis have generally done their religious rites inside closed buildings to avoid trouble as their worship places have been destroyed and damaged by right-wing religious protesters in the past.Mahmood said detaining Ahmadis from their place of worship for performing their rituals ""was a grave violation of human rights and Pakistan's Constitution"".DIG Baloch said the police would get a ""legal opinion"" about the place of worship as it was a sensitive matter.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) said on Tuesday it observed a growing trend of mob-led attacks on the homes of families belonging to religious minorities and their places of worship.The HRCP in a report also mentioned the ""arbitrary"" detention of Ahmadis, the alleged desecration of their graves, and the vulnerability of Hindu and Christian women to forced conversion.The HRCP in its report ""Under Siege: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2023-24"" said about 750 persons were in prison on charges of blasphemy as of October last year.It documented at least four faith-based killings, three of which targeted the Ahmadiyya community.","Ahmadis have generally done their religious rites inside closed buildings to avoid trouble.

Nepal King Gyanendra: Thousands rally in Kathmandu to welcome former king amid calls for return of monarchy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/thousands-rally-in-kathmandu-to-welcome-former-king-amid-calls-for-return-of-monarchy/articleshow/118821430.cms,"Thousands rally in Kathmandu to welcome former king amid calls for return of monarchy (Picture credit: PTI)

Nepal’s former King Gyanendra Shah was greeted with the chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday, amid growing calls for the reinstatement of the monarchy and Nepal’s status as a Hindu state.According to the news agency AFP, Shah’s supporters waved Nepal’s flag and chanted slogans like ""Come king, save the nation!"" as the 77-year-old former monarch stepped out of Tribhuvan International Airport following a tour of western Nepal.The crowd, which included members of the pro-monarchist Rastriya Prajatantra Party , carried placards reading ""We want our King back"" and ""Abolish federal republican system and reinstate the monarchy.""AP reported that an estimated 10,000 supporters gathered outside the airport, blocking its main entrance. Passengers were forced to walk to and from the airport due to the heavy crowd. Riot police were deployed to prevent demonstrators from entering the premises, but no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 240-year-old monarchy in 2008 after a decade-long civil war that left over 16,000 dead. However, dissatisfaction with political instability, corruption and economic struggles has fuelled a resurgence of support for the former royal family.“The country faces instability, prices are high, people are jobless, and there is a lack of education and healthcare facilities,” said Rajindra Kunwar, a teacher who joined the rally who was quoted by AFP. “The poor are dying of hunger. The law applies to the public, but not to politicians. That’s why we need the king back”, Kunwar added.Nepal has had 13 different governments since 2008, with growing frustration over governance issues. Some protesters, including those who previously supported the abolition of the monarchy, have now changed their stance. “I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken,” said Kulraj Shrestha, a carpenter. “The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind”, Shrestha added.Gyanendra, who has generally remained silent on political matters, has made several public appearances recently.

Can Gyanendra return to power?

Chants of ""Long live our beloved king"" and ""Vacate the royal palace for the king"" echoed through the streets of Kathmandu on Sunday as thousands of supporters of Nepal's former king, Gyanendra Shah , gathered to demand the restoration of the monarchy and Hinduism as the state religion.An estimated 10,000 royalists blocked the main entrance to Tribhuvan International Airport as Gyanendra returned from a tour of western Nepal. Protesters waved flags and carried banners calling for the former king’s reinstatement. The demonstration disrupted airport operations, forcing passengers to walk to and from the terminal, while hundreds of riot police prevented demonstrators from entering the airport. Despite the intensity of the protest, no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule. The country became a federal democratic republic, but since then, many Nepalis have grown frustrated with political instability and economic struggles.Since the abolition of the monarchy, Nepal has seen 13 different governments, leading many to believe the current system has failed. Corruption, economic hardship, and lack of political stability have left some citizens reconsidering their stance on monarchy.""We are here to give the king our full support and to rally behind him all the way to reinstating him in the royal throne,"" said Thir Bahadur Bhandari, a 72-year-old protester.Kulraj Shrestha, a 50-year-old carpenter, admitted he had initially opposed the monarchy but had since changed his mind. ""I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken. The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind,"" he said.Despite the growing support, Gyanendra has not commented on the renewed calls for his return. Political analysts believe his chances of regaining the throne remain slim in the near future. The republic is constitutionally enshrined, and mainstream political parties remain opposed to reinstating the monarchy.Gyanendra, who first became king in 2002 after the tragic massacre of his brother King Birendra and his family, initially ruled as a constitutional monarch. However, in 2005, he seized absolute power, dissolving the government and parliament, jailing politicians and journalists, and imposing emergency rule. His authoritarian rule led to the mass protests that ultimately resulted in the abolition of the monarchy.","Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule.

Ongoing global criticism



International pressure and Taliban's isolation



On International Women's Day, the Taliban issued a statement asserting their commitment to safeguarding the rights of Afghan women.Chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid posted on his official X account, stating that the ''Islamic Emirate assumes full responsibility for the provision and safeguarding of the rights of Afghan women.''Without directly referencing International Women's Day, Mujahid said that dignity, honor, and legal rights for women remain a priority for the Taliban government.He claimed that Afghan women ''live in security, both physically and psychologically''and that their ''fundamental rights'' — such as autonomy in marital decisions, dowry entitlements, and inheritance — are protected.The Taliban's statement comes as the United Nations continues to denounce the severe restrictions on Afghan women.Since seizing control in 2021, the Taliban have imposed sweeping bans on education and employment for women. Girls were barred from secondary education, and later, from attending and teaching at Kabul University.In August 2023, the Vice and Virtue Ministry expanded restrictions, prohibiting women's voices in public and mandating full face coverings outside the home.On Saturday, the UN renewed its call for these bans to be lifted. ''The erasure of women and girls from public life cannot be ignored,'' said Roza Otunbayeva, head of the UN mission in Afghanistan.Alison Davidian, special representative for UN Women Afghanistan, added, ""We must stand with Afghan women as if our own lives depend on it — because they do.""Mujahid emphasized distinctions in Afghan and Western notions of women's rights. He said ''Afghan women's rights are situated within the specific context of an Islamic and Afghan society, which exhibits distinct divergences from Western societies and their cultural paradigms.''The Taliban remain globally isolated, with no official recognition as running Afghanistan's government due to their policies on women. In January, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor requested arrest warrants for two senior Taliban officials for their role in repressing Afghan women.Last Friday, Unesco hosted a high-level conference on women and girls in Afghanistan, featuring activists, parliamentarians, and rights experts. They included Hamida Aman, founder of the women-only station Radio Begum, former Afghan lawmaker Fawzia Koofi and human rights expert Richard Bennett, who has been barred from entering Afghanistan.In response, Saif ul-Islam Khyber, a spokesman for the Vice and Virtue Ministry, dismissed such gatherings, calling them an ''exposure of the hypocrisy of certain organizations and European Union foundations.''","The Taliban issued a statement asserting their commitment to safeguarding the rights of Afghan women.

Bangladesh sees 'troubling' rise in cases of rape and assault on women,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-sees-troubling-rise-in-cases-of-rape-and-assault-on-women/articleshow/118809920.cms,"Representative image

DHAKA: Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus voiced strong concern over recent reports of attacks on women, calling them ""deeply troubling"" and a clear deviation from the vision of a ""New Bangladesh"" that the nation's people strive for.His comment, made at an International Women's Day event, came in the aftermath of the harrowing plight of an eight-year-old girl who is fighting for her life after being allegedly raped. This case is not an isolated incident but part of a broader, grim trend of sexual violence that has plagued the country. Reports of rape, gang rape, sexual assault and harassment have become disturbingly frequent.Addressing the situation of violence against women in Bangladesh that remained troubling since last year, with shocking numbers reported in the first two months, Fauzia Moslem, president of Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, said, ""Society is descending into chaos, where lawlessness and criminal impunity are growing. The failure of law enforcement, compromises, and lack of accountability are empowering criminals.""A report by the Manabadhikar Shongskriti Foundation (MSF) in Dhaka revealed that Feb 2025 documented 295 incidents of violence against women and children, 24 more than in Jan. It noted that Islamic fundamentalist groups, terrorists, and other extremist elements play a visible role in these incidents.A total of 21 women from various professions told local media that they experienced sexual harassment outside the home in past three months. The women, aged between 19 and 48 and residing in Dhaka, reported multiple instances.According to Dhaka-based human rights organisation Ain o Salish Kendra, in Feb, 46 women were victims of rape, 22 of whom were under 18. In Jan, this number was 39, including 15 minors.(With inputs from ANI)","Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus voiced strong concern over recent reports of attacks on women.

The organisation was termed as a ""terrorist organisation"" by India for trying to ""establish Islamic state and caliphate globally"".The ""March for Khilafat"" was joined by the thousands and the rally began from the north gate of Baitul Mukarram National Mosque in the capital city. The clashes erupted when the police intervened to stop the march, Dhaka Tribune reported.The procession initially proceeded without disruption, but tensions flared as demonstrators moved from Paltan towards Bijoynagar, where police set up a blockade. In response, Hizb ut-Tahrir members resisted, triggering a chase between both sides.To disperse the crowd, police fired tear gas shells and sound grenades, temporarily scattering the demonstrators. However, they later regrouped and attempted to resume their procession. As tensions escalated, law enforcement once again deployed tear gas, while protesters retaliated by hurling bricks and stones at officers. The confrontation intensified, resulting in the arrest of several Hizb ut-Tahrir members, Dhaka Tribune reported.The group remains a banned organization in Bangladesh, with all its activities and demonstrations declared illegal.The march comes amid rising concerns of violence against minorities and recent attacks on cultural, religious, and diplomatic properties in the south Asian nation, as raised by India at several occasions, especially after the ouster of former Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina last year.This was reiterated by a UN report released in January which revealed that members of Bangladesh's Hindu, Ahmadiyya Muslim, and indigenous communities faced human rights abuses during the anti-discrimination protests that led to the fall of Sheikh Hasina's government in 204 and its aftermath.It said that even though authorities had reportedly made 100 arrests in connection with the attacks, many perpetrators of revenge violence and targeted assaults continued to enjoy impunity.India declared Hizb ut-Tahrir a terrorist organisation last year and said that the group was ""involved in various acts of terror, including radicalising the gullible youths to join terrorist organisations and raise funds for terror activities, posing a serious threat to the national security and sovereignty of India. The Modi government is committed to securing Bharat by dealing the forces of terror with an iron fist.”“HuT is an organisation which aims to establish Islamic state and caliphate globally, including in India, by overthrowing democratically elected governments through jihad and terrorist activities by involving citizens of the country, which is a grave threat to the democratic setup and internal security of the country,” the ministry of home affairs had said.","Hizb ut-Tahrir held its first open rally in Dhaka on Friday against Bangladeshi administration's orders.

Nature rich coastline

Economic impact

GRIMSBY: Locals in the faded fishing town of Grimsby voiced fears for their livelihoods and the rich seaside environment Tuesday, a day after a cargo ship struck a tanker off England's northeast coast.There was shock Tuesday in the port town of Grimsby a day after a cargo ship struck a tanker off England's northeast coast with fears the accident could impact livelihoods and the environment.Some 13 miles (20 kilometres) out to sea, AFP images showed the Solong cargo ship, which on Monday hit the jet fuel-laden Stena Immaculate tanker , triggering a huge blaze, was little more than a smoking wreck.The still-anchored Stena Immaculate tanker was seen still anchored in the North Sea with a gaping gash to its side.In Grimsby, once the home of the world's largest fishing fleet, the port area where rescued sailors from the two ships were taken remained cordoned off.Twenty-four hours earlier the sound of helicopters and ambulances had filled the air as all but one of the crew members made it ashore.Townspeople steeped in the area's fishing and seafaring history expressed astonishment that such an accident could happen in broad daylight despite modern navigation equipment.The Stena Immaculate tanker carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel had been at anchor when the container ship Solong hurtled into it Monday morning.""(I was) very surprised,"" Raymond Todd, 71, told AFP at a local cafe, because modern equipment meant such accidents ""should not happen"".The retired fisherman, who went to sea at the age of 15 and spent his working life fishing waters around Iceland, Norway and Greenland, speculated that a ""mechanical failure with the radar or something"" might have been the cause.Otherwise, he said, ""I would think that (they) never had anybody manning the radar.""""Obviously it's thick fog out there, so they should have had extra lookouts on the bridge and if it was doing 16 knots, which I imagine is full speed why did they go so fast? In a busy shipping lane,"" he said.Todd said he feared any oil spill or release of toxic products from the ships could ""wreck"" the livelihoods of those fishermen who still ""actually go out there to earn a living"".Humberside police said Tuesday that a 59-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter following the accident.In the mid-20th century, Grimsby was one of the world's leading fishing ports but the fleets of trawlers began to disappear in the 1970s.Fishermen blamed the "" cod war "" over fishing grounds with Iceland, then EU quotas carved up the seas around Europe, reducing the catch of British boats.Locals also expressed fears for the region's bird and nature-rich coastline.Transport minister Mike Kane told parliament there was currently ""no sign of pollution"".But Andrew Vear, 54, said his wife, who works for a bird conservation group, was ""really concerned"", as he cleaned windows at a local pub.Vear said he too was worried about puffins and seals which have well-established colonies around the Humber estuary.Helen Dawson, 84, was more optimistic about the impact on the coastline. ""They'll get it cleared up somehow,"" she said.But she cautioned that if the fish were affected it would have an impact not just on local fishermen, but also local restaurants and others involved in the town's economy.""This is a fishing town, we're known for that,"" added massage therapist Amy Wilson, 34.She said she was upset about the ""human losses"" -- one missing crew member is presumed dead -- as well as ""the lasting impact on the environment"".For her, the accident was ""definitely another kick in the teeth"" for the region which has seen a decline in its economic fortunes over recent decades.Nearly a decade ago, some 70 per cent of people in the town voted for Brexit, hoping the UK's departure from the European Union would boost its flagging fortunes.But Wilson said there was little sign of any economic boost.""We keep getting promised improvements... It just isn't happening,"" she said.","Locals in the faded fishing town of Grimsby voiced fears for their livelihoods and the rich seaside environment Tuesday.

What was intended as a touching tribute quickly turned controversial, as critics accused the couple of being “irresponsible” for allowing their young daughter on a boat without a life vest.Meghan, 43, shared a photo on Instagram, showing her three-year-old daughter, Lilibet, curled up on her father Prince Harry’s lap as he gently kissed her head while they enjoyed a boat ride together.The social media post also featured more images celebrating inspiring women, including a charming selfie of Meghan with her mother, Doria Ragland, and a heartfelt snapshot of Meghan and Harry laughing and hugging on the beach.The caption read: ""Celebrating the strong women around us & the girls with dreams who will become women with vision. Also thanking those who uplift us every day.""However, numerous social media followers expressed concern regarding the absence of a safety vest on the three-year-old in the photograph.Users on X shared their opinions, with many criticising the former royal couple. Whilst some labelled it 'irresponsible', others highlighted its illegality. In California, where the couple lives with their two children, state law mandates that all children under 13 must wear a life jacket while aboard a moving vessel of any size.""Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are so good at showing the world how much they suck at being parents,"" stated one viral post on X.""Prince Harry & Meghan Markle never have the basic necessities for child safety which makes me question if they are parents. Where are the car seats? Where are the life vests? Do any children even live with them?"" another posted on X.One response noted, ""They're not even wearing seatbelts and life vests. Reckless.""""I've had boats my entire life. My children grew up to have their own boats. ALWAYS have a life jacket on your children,"" read another comment.""How irresponsible,' criticised one individual. 'Even pet owners put life vests on their pets when riding in boats.""A separate post stated: ""Meghan also had Archie on her lap without a seatbelt on herself or him in his car seat as legally required. The vehicle was going quite fast too.""","Meghan, 43, shared a photo of her daughter, Lilibet, on a boat with Prince Harry. The photo was meant to celebrate International Women's Day.
