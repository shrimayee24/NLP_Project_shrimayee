MUMBAI: Rohit Aarrya had doused the Powai studio with a petrol and rubber solution, threatening to set it ablaze if his demands were not met, according to the FIR filed by assistant police inspector Amol Waghmare, who entered the premises with three other cops to rescue the children and shot the captor in self defence after he “pointed to the pistol tucked in his waist at children’s side for a moment, and then pointed it towards me and my team, and he was about to fire”.Assistant police inspector Amol Waghmare, complainant in the hostage crisis, said in the FIR he reached the RA Studio complex around 2pm when chaos broke out. “A few parents rushed in, shouting that their children were not answering calls. Someone showed me a video circulating on WhatsApp — a man named Rohit Arryya claiming he had taken several children hostage inside the studio. He was threatening to burn the place down if anyone tried to intervene.Within minutes, police teams led by API Sohail Subedar and senior PI Sonawane reached the spot. The atmosphere was tense—parents were crying, and we could smell petrol from outside the studio. The accused doused the premises with a petrol and rubber solution, threatening to set it ablaze if his demands were not met. There were also batteries nearby. Police gained access through a duct and reached the first-floor bathroom where the children were confined.” TOI has a copy of the FIR.The children were kept hostage on the first floor. Waghmare along with sub-inspectors Rakesh Nalawade, Bade and Shinde entered through the bathroom window with the help of fire brigade. “We heard children crying in the bathroom.Then Rohit Aarrya entered and, leaving the children alone, at a distance of about two to three feet, he used a pepper spray, and then pointed to the pistol tucked in his waist... and was about to fire. To save myself, our team and children from being harmed, I fired a shot from my service pistol and he was injured. He was immediately taken to Jogeshwari trauma care hospital and the hostages were rescued and handed over to their parents. ”The FIR stated before the police team entered the studio, Rohan Aher who worked as assistant to Aarrya appeared at the window and told the cops that Aarrya had confined four children with ropes and put adhesive tapes on their mouths. “We saw a person from the window on the first floor saying his name was Rohit Aarrya and he started talking to us policemen. At that time, since his voice was not clear, Sonawane took his mobile number from one Amol Dorugade and called Aarrya on his mobile number. ” Aher is the key witness in the case, said the police.Cops requested him to release the children and promised to fulfil his demands. DCP Datta Nalawade called and tried to talk to him, but he was not stating clearly what his demand was. He threatened on phone that he would set the place on fire and may harm the children, the FIR said.","Rohit Aarrya had doused the Powai studio with a petrol and rubber solution, threatening to set it ablaze if his demands were not met.

Deadly Stampede at Andhra Pradesh After Chaos, Panic Strikes Venkateswara Temple, At Least 10 Dead





VIJAYAWADA: A stampede at a privately run temple in Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh killed nine devotees — eight women and a 13-year-old boy — and left more than 25 injured Saturday morning, after a railing collapse on a narrow staircase caused panic in a crowd of over 20,000 gathered for Karthika Ekadashi.The toll may rise as the condition of some of the injured is critical.The Venkateswara Swamy temple, located at Kasibugga under Palasa mandal and modelled on the Tirumala shrine in Tirupati, was built by 94-year-old Hari Mukund Panda from Odisha and opened just four months ago.One gate serving as both entry and exit, poor crowd control, and lack of official clearance turned the pilgrimage into chaos. “Nobody is responsible — it was an act of god,” Panda said.District police chief KV Maheswara Reddy said the main sanctum sits on the first floor with about 20 steps leading to it.“A railing along the staircase, believed to be poorly constructed, collapsed and caused a person to fall, triggering panic as the packed crowd surged forward,” he said.Calling the deaths “extremely heart-breaking”, CM N Chandrababu Naidu said: “Had police been informed in advance, they could have implemented a crowd management plan.Those responsible will face action.”Venkateswara Swamy temple at Kasibugga, visited by around 3,000 devotees on Saturdays, saw a crowd nearly seven times that number on the day of the stampede as it was the first Karthika Ekadashi since the temple’s inauguration. With no prior approval for the gathering or adequate security, the few guards were overwhelmed.District police chief K V Maheswara Reddy said temple authorities failed to alert police or the district administration about the festival and the likely crowd. Police have registered a case under section 100 (culpable homicide) of BNS and detained four temple staff for questioning.The shrine isn’t registered with Andhra Pradesh’s endowments department, which oversees thousands of temples. “Everything looked fine around 9am, but suddenly the number of devotees surged. Narrow stairway was choked. I was nearby when the railing broke and people started falling over each other,” said R Ramanamma, a devotee.The deceasad were identified as E Chinnammi (46), R Vijaya (48) from Tekkali; M Neelamma (60) from Vajrapukotturu; D Rajeswari (60), G Rupa (50), B Brunda from Mandasa; Ch Yasodamma (56) from Nandigam; D Ammulamma from Kasibugga; and L Nikhil (13) from Sompeta. Two women — B Kalavathi and R Kumari — remain critical. “I have instructed officials to ensure proper treatment for the injured,” chief minister Naidu said.PM Modi said he was “pained” by the tragedy. “My thoughts are with those who have lost their near and dear ones. I pray that the injured recover soon,” he said, announcing Rs 2 lakh ex gratia to each victim’s family and Rs 50,000 to the injured. Saturday’s crush was the third major temple tragedy in Andhra Pradesh this year — following six deaths at Tirupati’s Vaikunta Ekadashi token centre on Jan 8 and seven killed in a wall collapse at Visakhapatnam’s Simhachalam temple on Apr 30.","A railing collapse on a narrow staircase caused panic in a crowd of over 20,000 gathered for Karthika Ekadashi.

Several readers called up vendors and newspaper offices to ask why they hadn't got their day's copy.Police were vague about the reasons for the 'searches', variously saying that they had inputs about explosives / arms / drugs being smuggled in a newspaper vehicle. Later, Punjab Police issued a statement to say that ""various kinds of commercial vehicles"" were searched following ""intelligence inputs"" that drugs and weapons were smuggled in connivance with such drivers.Punjab DGP Gaurav Yadav declined calls from TOI. Special DGP Arpit Shukla said over the phone, ""I have come to know that the searches were carried out following inputs that drivers of the vehicles may have connived to smuggle drugs and illegal weapons.""The coordinated police action started around 4am on Sunday just when vehicles carrying newspapers began leaving presses.Several drivers told TOI that their phones were taken away.

""The scheme of the Act, insofar as it contemplates attachment of properties of an accused prior to conviction, is necessary because of the fact that on initiation of criminal proceedings, it is often the case that the accused transfer or alienate the properties acquired by them through commission of offences to frustrate the trial,"" it said.""In view of the covert nature of the operation of gangs, recovery of such properties, consequent to their alienation by the accused, is rendered hopeless.

'Vote For Bihar’s Future, Not Family Rule': Nitish Kumar Targets Lalu Yadav, RJD In Pre-Poll Message

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav has drawn sharp criticism from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after videos of him celebrating Halloween with his grandchildren surfaced on social media on Saturday.The BJP accused the former Bihar chief minister of hypocrisy, pointing out that he had earlier termed the Maha Kumbh festival “meaningless”.The party’s Kisan Morcha, in a post on X, said, “Don’t forget, people of Bihar, this is the same Lalu Yadav who had called the grand festival of faith and spirituality Maha Kumbh useless and is now celebrating the festival of Halloween. Those who attack faith will not get votes from the people of Bihar.”The videos were shared by Lalu’s daughter and RJD leader Rohini Acharya, who posted pictures of the family’s Halloween celebrations with the caption, “Happy Halloween to everyone.” The visuals showed Yadav posing for photos with his grandchildren dressed in costumes.Halloween, observed annually on October 31, is one of the most popular festivals in Western countries. Its roots trace back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, which marked the close of the harvest season and the onset of winter - a period once thought to dissolve the boundary between the living and the dead.In modern times, the celebration features costumes, trick-or-treating, pumpkin carving, eerie decorations, and themed parties.Lalu had sparked a row in February this year after he called the Maha Kumbh festival in Prayagraj “faltu"" (meaningless). Asked about the large crowds attending the religious gathering, he had said, “The Kumbh has no meaning… It is just meaningless.” His comment came while reacting to a stampede at the New Delhi railway station that left 18 people dead and several injured as passengers rushed to board trains bound for the religious congregation.Asked about the massive crowds travelling to Prayagraj and measures for crowd management, the RJD chief had said, “Kumbh ka kahan koi matlab hai. Faltu hai Kumbh (Is there any meaning to Kumbh? It is just meaningless).”The remarks triggered strong criticism from the BJP and several Hindu religious leaders, who accused Yadav of politicising the tragedy. Bihar BJP spokesperson Manoj Sharma said the statement reflected the RJD’s “mindset towards Hinduism”, while deputy chief minister Vijay Kumar Sinha charged the RJD leader with insulting Sanatana dharma and engaging in politics over the deaths.The fresh exchange between the BJP and RJD comes just days before the Bihar assembly elections, with polling scheduled in two phases on November 6 and 11 for the 243-seat assembly. Counting of votes will take place on November 14.","Lalu Prasad Yadav has drawn sharp criticism from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) The BJP accused the former Bihar chief minister of hypocrisy, pointing out that he had earlier termed the Maha Kumbh festival ""meaningless"" The fresh exchange comes just days before the Bihar assembly elections.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125028769,imgsize-1026852,width-400,resizemode-4/lalu-yadav-with-his-grandchildren-rohiniacharya2.jpg"

Bengaluru Road Rage Horror: Delivery Boy Chased, Crushed To Death By Martial Arts Trainer Couple

Victim Darshan

The accused, Manoj Kumar (32), a martial arts trainer from Kerala, and his wife Aarati Sharma (30)





BENGALURU: A chilling CCTV footage has emerged showing a Kalaripayattu trainer and his wife deliberately mowing down a 24-year-old food delivery agent in a fit of rage — and returning to the crime scene later to collect broken car parts.Police have arrested Manoj Kumar (32), a martial arts trainer from Kerala, and his wife Aarati Sharma (30), from Jammu & Kashmir, in connection with the October 25 incident that killed Darshan, a resident of Kembattalli.The couple, married for five years, has been remanded to 14-day judicial custody.The CCTV footage, accessed by police from Nataraja Layout in South Bengaluru, has revealed the sequence of events that turned a minor brush on the road into a murder.Also read: Delivery boy chased, crushed after road rage spat; martial arts trainer, wife arrested for murder Around 9pm, Darshan’s gearless scooter accidentally brushed against Kumar’s car, slightly damaging its right-side rear-view mirror. Though Darshan apologised and sped away — as he was on his way to deliver food — Kumar allegedly lost his temper.“Losing control of himself, he took a U-turn, chased the scooter, and rammed it from behind,” said a senior investigating officer. “The impact threw Darshan and his pillion rider Varun onto the road.The car didn’t stop.”Locals rushed the duo to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared Darshan brought dead. His sister later filed a hit-and-run case with JP Nagar traffic police.But when investigators examined the CCTV footage, they were stunned. “To our horror, we discovered it was not an accident. The driver deliberately veered left and rammed into the scooter,” a senior officer said.Further footage showed the same car returning to the accident site around 9.40pm. “The couple, wearing masks, parked nearby and collected parts of their car that had broken off during the impact. As they left again, CCTV cameras captured their faces clearly,” the officer added.The footage helped police identify the car and trace the couple to their residence. Deputy commissioner of police (South) Lokesh Jagalasar confirmed the arrests, saying, “The accused have confessed to their involvement.”While Manoj claimed he was alone during the ramming and that Aarati had only accompanied him later to retrieve the car parts, police said they are verifying his version.Darshan, a bachelor, is survived by his parents and sister.

Chirag Paswan Accuses Owaisi of Dividing Muslims Through Fear Politics

Tejashwi avoids reaction to Owaisi

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has increased his attack on the opposition Mahagathbandhan, questioning why the alliance has not named any Muslim leader as its deputy chief minister face for the Bihar elections Addressing supporters, Owaisi said, ""Sitting next to Tejashwi Yadav, Mukesh Bhai of the VIP Party, confident in his community's history, declared that the Malla community is with Tejashwi. The Malla community represents 3% of Bihar's population. He declared that if they gain power, he will become the deputy CM... If a Malla's son will become the deputy chief minister, what will the 17% minority community in Bihar do? Are they only to spread 'Dari ' (carpet)?""He added, ""If a Malla's son can become the deputy chief minister, then Mohammad's son can also become the Prime Minister or chief minister. Nothing can stop us from achieving our goals. Remember, the more you dream, the more you trust in Allah's will, and the more you strive along the way, the more you will see the clearer the path will become.""On Tuesday, Owaisi had raised a similar question. He said, ""Why cannot a Muslim, who represents 17 per cent of the state's population, become the chief minister? After all, they seem to have no problem with promising the deputy CM's post to a person who represents only three per cent of the population.""He criticised Congress, RJD and Samajwadi Party, saying these parties seek Muslim votes without offering leadership roles. Owaisi said, ""Parties like Congress, RJD and Samajwadi Party seek votes of Muslims, cashing in on the minority community's fear of the BJP. These parties have not been able to stop the BJP but are still trying to get the votes of Muslims under the same pretext.""He also targeted the BJP. Owaisi said, ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi claims to take all along and strive to work for the progress of all. But his party fails to give tickets, in elections, to a single Muslim.""RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav declined to respond to Owaisi’s remarks. When asked, he said, ""Leave it. What can I say about it?"" Tejashwi is the Mahagathbandhan’s declared chief minister candidate.In the previous assembly elections, AIMIM contested 19 seats and won five, though four of its MLAs later moved to the RJD.In the 2020 Bihar Assembly elections, AIMIM contested 20 seats and won five, all from the Seemanchal belt. Seemanchal includes Araria, Katihar, Kishanganj and Purnia, located close to the West Bengal border. The Muslim population in Bihar is around 17.7%, and Muslims form about 40% of the population in at least 11 constituencies. They have a decisive influence on around 47 seats.The four districts of Kishanganj, Araria, Purnia and Katihar have 24 seats that will go to polls in the second phase. These districts have a high Muslim population. For many years, this region was seen as a strong area for the RJD and Congress. Owaisi first contested here in 2015 but did not win.Before the 2020 elections, AIMIM won a bypoll seat in Kishanganj. In 2020, the party won five seats — two each in Kishanganj and Purnia, and one in Araria. This changed the electoral maths in multiple seats, reducing the RJD-Congress vote share. The NDA finally defeated the Opposition by a slim margin, where a difference of only 12,000 votes separated the two sides in the final seat tally.The Mahagathbandhan released its manifesto on Tuesday, titled 'Bihar Ka Tejashwi Pran'. It promises that within 20 days of forming the government, a law will be passed to give one government job per family.The 2025 Bihar assembly elections will take place between the National Democratic Alliance (BJP, JD-U, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and Rashtriya Lok Morcha) and the Mahagathbandhan (RJD, Congress, CPI-ML, CPI, CPM and VIP).Polling will be held in two phases, on November 6 and 11. Counting of votes will take place on November 14.","AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has increased his attack on the opposition Mahagathbandhan.

American rapper Nicki Minaj stirred row after publicly thanking President Donald Trump after he spoke out about the persecution of Christians in Nigeria. Minaj praised Trump’s remarks as “powerful” and “heartfelt,” but some fans accused her of aligning with the MAGA base.Trump, in a Truth Social post on Friday, claimed that “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria” and that “radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter.” He added, “The United States cannot stand by while such atrocities are happening in Nigeria, and numerous other countries. We stand ready, willing, and able to save our great Christian population around the world!”Minaj shared her response, expressing gratitude. “Reading this made me feel a deep sense of gratitude,” she posted on X. “We live in a country where we can freely worship God. No group should ever be persecuted for practicing their religion. We don’t have to share the same beliefs in order for us to respect each other.”Minaj has been vocal about her Christian faith and its impact on a global scale. “Numerous countries all around the world are being affected by this horror [and] it’s dangerous to pretend we don’t notice,” she said. “Thank you to the president [and] his team for taking this seriously.God bless every persecuted Christian. Let’s remember to lift them up in prayer.”Her comments drew praise from some conservatives but backlash from a portion of her fanbase. Others pointed out that Minaj had previously spoken about social justice and women’s rights, accusing her of inconsistency.The situation in Nigeria remains alarming, with reports of entire villages being destroyed and thousands displaced by Islamist groups. “Even being conservative, it’s probably 4,000 to 8,000 Christians killed annually,” said Mark Walker, Trump’s ambassador-designate for International Religious Freedom. “This has been going on for years, from ISWAP to Islamist Fulani ethnic militias, and the Nigerian government has to be much more proactive. ”Trump has said he directed members of the House Appropriations Committee to investigate and that Nigeria will be redesignated a “country of particular concern” under US law, a label reserved for severe violations of religious freedom.","Nicki Minaj publicly thanked President Donald Trump after he spoke out about the persecution of Christians in Nigeria.

Panic and chaos gripped passengers on a London-bound train on Saturday evening after a mass stabbing left ten people hospitalised, nine with life-threatening injuries.One passenger told Sky News he saw a man “extremely bloodied” stumble through the carriage shouting, “They’ve got a knife, I’ve been stabbed.” He said, “That person ended up collapsing on the floor. They were taken to an ambulance pretty much straight away.”Others recalled people sprinting through the train to escape as the attacker moved through carriages.Wren Chambers, who was also on board, told the BBC they ran to the front of the train after seeing a man bolt past with a bloody arm, shouting “they’ve got a knife, run.” “We were pretty scared once we knew what was happening,” Chambers said. “We were able to get off the train unharmed.”When the train came to an emergency stop in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, armed officers stormed the station. A witness described seeing police “directing their weapons at a man on the platform with a large blade.” The suspect was eventually “tasered and restrained,” said another passenger, Gavin. “He then was waving a knife, quite a large knife, and then they detained him.I think it was a Taser that got him down in the end,” he told Sky News.Passengers described “blood everywhere” and people hiding in toilets as the attack unfolded. One told The Times that others were getting “stamped on” in the rush to escape. Another described the horror as “like something from a film — really violent.”British Transport Police confirmed ten people were taken to hospital, nine with “life-threatening injuries.” Counter-terrorism officers are assisting with the investigation, though the motive remains unclear.

Los Angeles Chargers linebacker Daiyan Henley is facing a heartbreaking loss after his older brother, Jabari Henley, was shot and killed on October 31, 2025, in Los Angeles. The 34-year-old’s death has left the Henley family devastated and the NFL community rallying behind the young defender, who now carries the weight of personal grief in the middle of a demanding season. Authorities confirmed that Jabari died after being shot in what investigators believe was not a random attack.Early reports suggest the shooting may have stemmed from a personal dispute, though details remain limited as the Los Angeles Police Department continues to investigate. So far, no arrests have been made, and police have asked witnesses to come forward with any information that could help identify the suspect. The timing of the tragedy couldn’t be more difficult for Daiyan, who learned the news just days before the Chargers’ scheduled matchup against the Tennessee Titans. Still, the 24-year-old linebacker made the emotional decision to play, turning his pain into motivation.“My brother was more than his life’s mistakes. He was family. I’ll carry him with me this game,” Henley said before kickoff.The Henley family has endured multiple heartbreaks in recent years.Daiyan’s father, Eugene “Big U” Henley Jr., is currently on trial for the death of Rayshawn Williams, Daiyan’s close friend and former teammate. That case has already placed the family under intense public scrutiny, and Jabari’s murder now adds another layer of sorrow and complexity to their lives. Those close to the family say they’ve been leaning on faith and each other while navigating the dual weight of tragedy and public attention. As investigators work through leads, the family continues to plead for justice and privacy.Inside the Chargers camp, teammates and coaches have rallied around Daiyan Henley, offering him space, support, and understanding as he grieves. Those close to the rookie say he’s remained composed and focused despite the heartbreak. Henley has always been known for his toughness and perseverance — traits that helped him rise from his college days at Washington State to the NFL. But this loss has tested him in a way that goes far beyond the game.As the Chargers take the field, fans and teammates will be watching not just his performance, but the quiet strength of a player honoring his brother’s memory through determination and heart.","Jabari Henley, 34, was shot and killed on October 31, 2025, in Los Angeles.

The FBI responded to the allegation that director Kash Patel flew on a $60M FBI jet to attend his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins' performance in Pennsylvania, and said he broke no rules while he did that. The allegation came from a former FBI agent-turned-podcaster Kyle Seraphin who commented about Patel flying around the country during the ongoing government shutdown.“We’re in the middle of government shutdown where they’re not even gonna pay all of the employees that work for the agency that this guy heads,” Seraphin said. “And this guy is jetting off to hang out with his girlfriend in Nashville on our dime?”This is not the first time that Kash Patel 's use of FBI jets for personal reasons came under fire. This time, the FBI issued a detailed statement comparing Kash Patel's travels with his predecessors, like Chris Wray and James Comey.The FBI director is not allowed to travel in commercial planes and they are only supposed to travel in government planes. Following the established rules, Director Patel pays a reimbursement in advance, Ben Williamson, assistant director for public affairs at FBI, said.Williamson detailed the steps Kash Patel personally takes to minimize spending. When Patel flies, he chooses to take a government airfield instead of airport like DCA (Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport) as the government option is 2.5X cheaper.Williamson said Chris Wray, James Comey, for example, never did that and they mostly used DCA.""Kash himself has significantly limited personal travel - but he’s allowed to take personal time on occasion to see family, friends or his longtime girlfriend.

This versatile meal, with its cultural variations, represents civilization's structure holding life's chaos together. It's a testament to human ingenuity, allowing us to eat and move, a portable philosophy for our restless existence.

The Sandwich and the Soul







Somewhere in 18th-century England, a man too addicted to gambling to pause for dinner stumbled upon the world’s most democratic invention. John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich, unwilling to leave his gaming table, asked a servant to bring him roast beef tucked between two slices of bread. It allowed him to eat without interrupting his vice or dirtying the cards. His fellow gamblers began asking for “the same as Sandwich,” and thus, through an act of aristocratic laziness, the modern sandwich was born.Of course, people had been wrapping food in bread long before Montagu. The ancient Jews had lamb with matzah, the Greeks had gyros, and the Indians had parathas and kati rolls. But history rarely rewards invention; it rewards branding. The Earl didn’t invent the sandwich, he named it. And like most white people, got the credit for non-white solutions. And naming is how civilisation turns accidents into myths.Every year, on November 3rd, the world honours that glorious accident on World Sandwich Day, a celebration of the meal that lets us multitask through modernity: eat, move, scroll and survive.Defining a sandwich sounds simple until you try it.What exactly qualifies? Must it be two slices of bread? Does a burger count? A wrap? A taco? Somewhere, someone once decided this mattered. And because this is humanity, we took it to court.In 2006, a Massachusetts judge presided over White City Shopping Center v. PR Restaurants, a case in which Panera Bread tried to block Qdoba Mexican Grill from opening nearby. The lease said no other “sandwich” shop could operate in the plaza. Panera argued that burritos were sandwiches. The court disagreed. A burrito, the judge ruled, is not a sandwich, since it’s made with a single tortilla, not two slices of bread.And that’s how an American courtroom immortalised the absurdity of modern civilisation: a judge deciding, in black-letter law, that a burrito is not a sandwich.Philosophically, the question runs deeper. The sandwich isn’t just food; it’s a concept, the act of edible containment. It’s bread as architecture, filling as essence, civilisation as structure enclosing chaos. To hold a sandwich is to hold the illusion that the messy stuff of life can be neatly contained between two slices of order.The Earl of Sandwich didn’t just create a meal. He created a metaphor for existence.An estimated billion sandwiches are consumed globally each day. The United States alone devours around 300 million daily, enough to feed almost the entire population once over. The British eat twelve billion a year, most of them purchased in cling-wrapped triangles from supermarkets, a quiet ritual of lunch-hour melancholy.Every culture has its own variant. The Vietnamese bánh mì—a French baguette filled with pickled vegetables and pork—turns colonial trauma into culinary triumph. The Bombay sandwich piles potatoes, chutneys and spice into a stack that mocks the blandness of British legacy. The torta in Mexico, the shawarma roll in the Middle East, the Smørrebrød in Scandinavia—all regional responses to the same existential question: how do you hold life in your hands without letting it fall apart?Each sandwich tells a story of globalisation, trade, migration and adaptation. It’s history you can bite into, portable proof that civilisation’s progress often begins with someone saying, “I don’t have time for a plate.”If bread represents order and the filling represents chaos, then every sandwich is an edible philosophy. Between the slices lies the entire drama of human existence: structure holding together substance, convenience containing complexity.Civilisation functions exactly like that. We build institutions, laws and borders, our bread, to hold together the unpredictable filling of life. The sandwich, then, is not merely lunch. It is a metaphor for our daily compromise between stability and desire.The beauty of the sandwich is its lack of hierarchy. It belongs equally to the construction worker and the corporate CEO, the schoolchild and the scholar. It can be devoured in seconds or crafted like art. It travels well, offends no gods and adapts to every culture that adopts it.In the post-industrial world, where time is rationed and hunger is scheduled, the sandwich is our last act of autonomy. It says: I may not have an hour for lunch, but I will not go hungry.The holy trinity of breakfast rebellion — bacon, lettuce, and tomato, proving that virtue (lettuce) only exists to highlight sin (bacon). A sandwich that tastes like a lazy Sunday pretending to be healthy.An immigrant’s fever dream turned deli masterpiece — corned beef, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing in an edible Cold War. It’s what happens when America decides to pickle its guilt and serve it on rye.The bourgeoisie’s architectural marvel: three layers, two toothpicks, zero shame. It’s not lunch — it’s a real estate deal between bacon, turkey, and self-importance.Democracy between buns — the meat sweats, the cheese melts, and everyone pretends it’s not political. One bite and you understand why America will never be vegan.Colonial hangover meets street-smart swagger — buttered bread with rebellion between slices. It’s the only toast that can start a conversation and a riot at the same time.In a sense, we are all the Earl of Sandwich now, addicted to our own endless games, too busy to sit down, feeding our appetites between deadlines and dopamine hits. The sandwich is our perfect companion: functional, adaptable, endlessly customisable and quietly tragic.It lets us believe we’re being efficient while we devour the hours we’ve lost. It lets us pretend that nourishment and productivity can coexist. It’s the edible embodiment of modern life’s contradiction: we crave comfort, yet we can’t stop moving.Perhaps that’s why the sandwich endures. It’s not just convenience; it’s confession. Between those slices of bread lies a portrait of who we’ve become—civilised, restless and forever hungry.So today, on World Sandwich Day, as you bite into your BLT, your grilled cheese, your vada pav or your bánh mì, remember the unlikely philosopher who made it all possible: a gambler who couldn’t leave the table, and a civilisation still pretending it can.Because in the end, the sandwich isn’t just something we eat. It’s what we are, a fragile structure of order and chaos, held delicately together by the hope that everything won’t fall apart before the next bite.","November 3rd is World Sandwich Day, a celebration of the meal that lets us multitask through modernity: eat, move, scroll and survive. This versatile meal, with its cultural variations, represents civilization's structure holding life's chaos together. It's a testament to human ingenuity, allowing us to eat and move.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125046655,imgsize-235542,width-400,resizemode-4/125046655.jpg"
‘We will be involved’: Donald Trump says US will back Netanyahu in his criminal trial; calls charges against him ‘very unfair’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/we-will-be-involved-donald-trump-says-us-will-back-netanyahu-in-his-criminal-trial-calls-charges-against-him-very-unfair/articleshow/125046409.cms,"Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu (AP)





US President Donald Trump said Washington will “be involved” in the criminal trial of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu , claiming that the premier has been treated unfairly.“We’ll be involved in that to help him out a little bit because I think it’s very unfair,” Trump said in an interview with CBS News, suggesting that further US involvement in the Israeli prime minister’s criminal case could follow.Trump has repeatedly weighed in on the case in recent months, rejecting the bribery, fraud, and breach of trust charges against Netanyahu.“I had to push him a little bit one way or the other. I did a great job in pushing,” Trump said, adding that Netanyahu is a “very talented guy… (who has) never been pushed before.”“I didn’t like certain things that he did, and you saw what I did about that,” Trump added.Netanyahu is facing trial in three corruption cases, charged with fraud and breach of trust in Cases 1000 and 2000, and with bribery, fraud, and breach of trust in Case 4000.The prime minister has denied any wrongdoing, claiming the allegations are part of a political plot orchestrated by the police and state prosecution.In the interview, Trump also called the Gaza ceasefire “not fragile” and warned that Hamas would be “eliminated” if it did not disarm. Asked how he would make that happen, he said that if he wanted Hamas to disarm, he could get them to do so ""very quickly.""“If I want them to disarm, I’ll get them to disarm very quickly.They’ll be eliminated,"" Trump said.While Trump’s 20-point plan calls for Hamas to disarm, the ceasefire agreement signed by Israel and Hamas in Egypt on October 9 focused solely on the initial IDF withdrawal, a hostage-prisoner exchange, and the delivery of humanitarian aid, as reported by the Times of Israel.When asked whether he had urged Netanyahu to apologize to Qatar, agree to a ceasefire in Gaza, or could persuade him to recognize a Palestinian state, Trump sidestepped the question, saying only that he has worked well with the “wartime prime minister.”“That’s the kind of person you needed in Israel at the time,” Trump said.","US President Donald Trump said Washington will “be involved” in the criminal trial of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

On healthcare and the fight over Obamacare



‘I won’t be extorted’: Trump refuses to negotiate over govt shutdown







US President Donald Trump appeared on CBS’s 60 Minutes in his first interview with the network since settling a lawsuit with CBS News earlier this year.Trump had famously walked out of a 60 Minutes interview with Lesley Stahl before the 2020 election, accusing the show of bias. Trump later sued the company over the newsmagazine’s interview with Kamala Harris, and Paramount reportedly paid $16 million to settle the case this summeIn his latest appearance, Trump defended his administration’s handling of key foreign and domestic challenges, from nuclear tensions and Middle East diplomacy to immigration, healthcare, and the ongoing government shutdown.The sit-down, recorded Friday at his Mar-a-Lago residence with journalist Norah O’Donnell, aired Sunday night.President Trump alleged that both Russia and China have been secretly testing nuclear weapons underground. “Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it,” he said. Asked why he recently ordered the United States to conduct its own nuclear tests, Trump explained, “You don’t necessarily know where they’re testing. They test way underground where people don’t know exactly what’s happening with the test. ”“Well, we have more nuclear weapons than any other country. Russia's second. China's a very distant third, but they'll be even in five years. You know, they're makin' 'em rapidly, and I think we should do something about denuclearization, which is gonna be some-- and I did actually discuss that with both President Putin and President Xi. Denuclearization's a very big thing. We have enough nuclear weapons to blow up the world 150 times.Russia has a lot of nuclear weapons, and China will have a lot,” he siad.Speaking about Iran, Trump said that his administration had “blasted the hell out of them” to prevent Tehran from becoming a nuclear power. “You could’ve never had any kind of a deal if you had a nuclear Iran. And you essentially had a nuclear Iran,” he said.He described meeting the pilots who carried out the strike and inviting them to the White House. “They told me something I didn’t know. They said, ‘Sir, for 22 years we’ve been practising this route … and you were the only president that let us do our job.’”Trump praised them as “real American heroes,” adding, “When you can hit at midnight with no moon, with no vision, every single air shaft, where that bomb went deep into that mountain and exploded … they deserve to come to the White House.”During the interview, Trump acknowledged the precarious balance in South Asia, noting that the United States continues to monitor India and Pakistan closely. Although he avoided direct mention of current military developments, administration officials have said Washington remains wary of escalation in the region, especially given the ongoing nuclear concerns.Trump once again claimed he helped prevent a potential nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan. “I think we're gonna get it done, yeah. I think he really wants to do business with the US,” Trump said, adding, “If it wasn't for tariffs and trade I wouldn't have been able to make the deals... They were going to war. They were gonna have a nuclear war with Pakistan.”Trump cited comments by Pakistan’s prime minister, saying, “If Donald Trump didn't get involved, many millions of people would be dead right now.”In May, India launched Operation Sindoor, carrying out precision strikes on terrorist camps located across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir in response to the Pahalgam terror attack, which had killed 26 civilians the previous month.India has firmly denied any US involvement, reiterating that de-escalation was achieved solely through direct military communication between the two nations.Trump repeatedly attacked former President Barack Obama’s legacy, linking him to what he called “a defective plan put into line by Barack Hussein Obama, who was a lousy president.” He even ridiculed the Obama Presidential Center project in Chicago, saying, “He’s building a museum that’s, like, four times over budget … The neighbourhood doesn’t even want ‘em.”At one point, Trump hit out at New York Mayoral race front-runner Zohran Mamdani , invoking them in the context of what he sees as elite detachment from “real American” priorities.“Communist, not Socialist. Communist. He's far--far worse than a Socialist. Oh, that's so crazy. Look. When I left New York, we were at the-- the epitome of it was a great city. It was doing great. It was a great city, but there were some bad sides, because we had a guy named de Blasio, who was the worst mayor. Like I say Biden was the worst president, de Blasio was the worst mayor in history,” the 47th POTUS said.He went on to add, “I think he's probably gonna make de Blasio look great. I think he will make de Blasio look like one of our great mayors. De Blasio was the worst mayor we've ever had. Now I saw that, you know, but I was sort of leaving during that period of time.”Trump used the platform to claim success in halting illegal immigration across the US-Mexico border. “We have a closed border right now,” he said. “For five months in a row, they have zero — think of this, zero people coming into our country through our southern border.”He accused Mexico of allowing “their prisons to be emptied into our country,” calling it one of his administration’s greatest challenges. “Millions of people a year walked into our country totally unchecked, unvetted. They were criminals, murderers, drug dealers, people from jails and mental institutions,” he said.When asked if Nicolás Maduro’s days as Venezuela’s president were numbered, Trump said, “I would say yeah. I think so, yeah.”Pressed by O’Donnell about speculation that the United States might be preparing strikes in Venezuela, Trump refused to confirm or deny it. “I’m not gonna tell you what I’m gonna do with Venezuela, if I was gonna do it or if I wasn’t going to do it,” he said, calling it a matter of national security.He pointed to the rise of violent transnational gangs such as Tren de Aragua, saying Venezuela had “been bad” in exporting criminal networks.Asked about Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s upcoming visit to the White House and his insistence that the kingdom would not join the Abraham Accords without a two-state solution, Trump replied, “No. I think he’s gonna join.”He added, “We will have a solution. I don’t know if it’s gonna be two-state. That’s gonna be up to Israel and other people, and me.”Trump argued that peace in the Middle East was only possible because his administration prevented Iran from becoming a nuclear power.The president squarely blamed Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown, now in its sixth week. “Democrats’ fault,” he said flatly, accusing them of refusing to vote for an extension that would reopen federal offices. “They don’t wanna give us an extension because they used to think it was good for them, but the polls are turning around.”He said Democrats were suffering from “Trump derangement syndrome” and insisted, “All they have to do, Norah, is say, ‘Let’s vote.’ And you can open the economy during our interview.”Healthcare dominated much of the domestic discussion. Trump said Democrats were blocking progress on reform. “We almost did it. We were one vote short. John McCain made a mistake, frankly,” he said.He repeated his long-standing criticism of the Affordable Care Act, calling it “bad healthcare at far too high a price.” “It’s too expensive for the people,” Trump said. “They’re gonna get a very big increase this year.”Democrats have pushed to extend subsidies under Obamacare to prevent premiums from doubling for millions of Americans. O’Donnell noted that “three quarters of these people that will see their healthcare premiums double live in states where you won in the last election.” Trump responded, “And I’m saying we can fix it.”Trump rejected calls to compromise with Democrats to reopen the government. “I won’t be extorted,” he said, insisting that he would not “give $1.5 trillion so that prisoners, drug dealers and people from mental institutions” could receive welfare or healthcare.He also pressed Republicans to end the Senate filibuster, telling 60 Minutes, “Republicans have to get tougher. If we end the filibuster, we can do exactly what we want.”","US President Donald Trump appeared on CBS’s 60 Minutes in his first interview with the network since settling a lawsuit with CBS News earlier this year.

INSANE FOOTAGE: ICE Agents Clash With 'MEXICAN CRIMINAL' Wanted By U.S. immigration, Another Nabbed





A mayor in Mexico’s western state of Michoacán was shot dead in a public plaza on Saturday, in front of dozens gathered for Day of the Dead celebrations.Authorities said Carlos Alberto Manzo Rodríguez, who had repeatedly appealed to President Claudia Sheinbaum for more resources to combat drug traffickers in the region, was gunned down in the attack.The attack on Manzo, a former Morena lawmaker, was caught on video and circulated on social media. The footage shows residents and tourists enjoying the festivities before multiple gunshots are heard, sending people fleeing for cover.The assault was reportedly carried out by an unidentified man who shot the mayor seven times, said federal security secretary Omar García Harfuch.He added that the weapon used in the killing had been linked to two previous armed clashes between rival criminal groups operating in the region.“No line of investigation is being ruled out to clarify this cowardly act that took the life of the mayor,” Harfuch added, as cited by the Guardian.Manzo had been an outspoken critic of President Claudia Sheinbaum’s handling of organized crime and had repeatedly urged federal authorities for greater support. In recent months, he had posted videos expressing fear for his safety.Last year, a journalist was fatally shot just moments after interviewing Manzo in Uruapan, as reported by the New York Times.Michoacán has become a flashpoint for violent clashes between cartels competing for control of the drug trade.Earlier this year, President Claudia Sheinbaum rebuked Manzo after he urged local police to shoot criminals attacking civilians. Manzo, once part of her Morena party, ran as an independent in 2024.On Sunday, hundreds of Uruapan residents dressed in black and carrying photographs of Manzo joined his funeral procession through the town’s streets. The crowd chanted “Justice, justice. Out with Morena,” in a show of anger toward President Claudia Sheinbaum’s ruling party.The mayor’s killing comes months after the death of Salvador Bastidas, the mayor of Tacámbaro, another municipality in Michoacán. Bastidas and his bodyguard were shot dead in June as they arrived at his home in the town’s Centro neighborhood.","Carlos Alberto Manzo Rodríguez was shot seven times in a public plaza in Uruapan, Mexico.

Donald Trump’s nuclear push sparks confusion: Will tests include explosions?

US Energy Secy Clarifies On Trump's Nuclear Test Bombshell; ‘No Choice Left' | Watch





US President Donald Trump has ordered fresh tests of the American nuclear weapons system, sparking questions on whether the United States is preparing to resume nuclear explosions after more than three decades. The announcement was made on social media last week and followed by remarks ahead of his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea.However, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Sunday clarified that the testing would not involve nuclear explosions but would instead focus on “the other parts of a nuclear weapon” to ensure they are working properly.Wright’s comments came four days after Trump declared that he was ordering the US military to resume nuclear testing “on an equal basis” with other countries, raising the spectre of a return to the worst days of the Cold War. “I think the tests we’re talking about right now are systems tests,” Wright said in an interview on the Fox News show The Sunday Briefing. “These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions. ”Wright said Americans in places such as Nevada, where the United States has a nuclear test site bigger than the state of Rhode Island, should not expect to see a mushroom cloud. On Wednesday — minutes before he met with President Xi Jinping of China in South Korea — Trump said in a social media post that he was ordering the Pentagon to step up testing of nuclear weapons.“We’ve halted it years — many years — ago,” Trump later told reporters, referring to the last US explosive test of a nuclear weapon in 1992. “But with others doing testing, I think it is appropriate that we do also.”Wright reiterated that testing was underway on the new nuclear systems. “And again, these will be nonnuclear explosions,” he said, adding, “These are just developing sophisticated systems so that our replacement nuclear weapons are even better than the ones they were before.”The confusion over Trump’s intentions began just minutes before his key meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea. Posting on his Truth Social platform, Trump appeared to signal that he was preparing to end the decades-long US moratorium on testing nuclear weapons.Later that day, as he returned to Washington, the President remained evasive about whether he was ordering the resumption of full-scale nuclear detonations — a practice seen only in North Korea this century — or referring instead to routine tests of the systems used to deliver such weapons.Detonation tests are no longer common. The only nation that has been regularly conducting nuclear tests in the past quarter-century is North Korea, whose last test was in September 2017.China has rapidly expanded its nuclear stockpile and deployed missiles in new silos but has not tested a nuclear weapon since 1996. Russia has not conducted a confirmed test since 1990, although it recently declared that it had tested two new delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons — a nuclear-powered cruise missile and an undersea torpedo, called Poseidon, capable of crossing the Pacific to the US West Coast. The United States itself routinely tests unarmed missiles.In 1993, the Clinton administration announced plans for a treaty under which nations would forgo nuclear blasts. Although the 1996 test-ban treaty never officially entered into force, it established a global norm of not testing destructive bombs.Washington is currently undertaking a major effort to replace its warheads with updated versions. The overall cost of the sprawling programme over three decades is estimated at $1.7 trillion.",US Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Sunday clarified that the testing would not involve nuclear explosions. Wright’s comments came four days after Trump declared that he was ordering the US military to resume nuclear testing “on an equal basis” with other countries.

Birthday party turns deadly: Shooting takes place at Ohio Airbnb; juveniles among nine injured,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/birthday-party-turns-deadly-shooting-takes-place-at-ohio-airbnb-juveniles-among-nine-injured/articleshow/125045508.cms,"



Nine people, including teenagers, were injured when an unknown shooter or shooters opened fire during a party at an Airbnb rental at around midnight on the 900 block of Top O Hill Drive in Bath Township, Ohio.Bath Township Police said officers responded after multiple 911 calls reported a shooting at the home. Police believe a large group of juveniles arrived after a social media post promoted the event, which the Associated Press reported was a birthday party.Officials said the shooter or shooters fired multiple rounds inside the home, struck several people and then fled the scene. When emergency personnel arrived, they provided life-saving assistance to the victims, who were then taken to hospital.The victims’ ages range from 15 to 20. Several local agencies assisted with the investigation.Police said the current condition of the victims is unknown. Investigators from the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigations and Bath Township Police are processing the crime scene.Police Chief Vito Sinopoli said the large home had been rented out on Airbnb, which is not allowed under local zoning ordinances, and most of the people at the party were under 18.He said the victims may include a mix of juveniles and adults. Social media posts about the party drew a big crowd, he said, as per AP.It was not immediately known what sparked the shooting and how many people fired guns, he said. No arrests were announced.“The Bath Township community experienced a tragic and senseless act of violence early this morning,"" Sinopoli said.Akron Mayor Shammas Malik said, “The City of Akron will do anything needed to assist Bath officials in the investigation that is already underway.Those who perpetrate violence anywhere in our community must be held accountable for their actions. This kind of deadly behavior cannot be normalized.”Anyone with information is asked to call the Bath Township Police Department Detective Bureau at 330-666-3736.Airbnb said, “We are heartbroken by this senseless act of gun violence, and our thoughts are with the injured victims and all those affected by it. Unauthorized and disruptive gatherings are strictly prohibited on Airbnb and our Safety team acted immediately to remove the account of the individual who deliberately broke those rules by booking this stay. Our law enforcement response team is in contact with the chief of Bath Township Police Department to assist their ongoing investigation to ensure those responsible for this terrible incident are brought to justice. ”Airbnb said it is also in contact with the host, and the listing is suspended from the platform as investigations continue.

"'No, not really': Trump rules out Tomahawk missiles deal for Ukraine — is Russia behind U-turn?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-not-really-trump-rules-out-tomahawk-missiles-deal-for-ukraine-is-russia-behind-u-turn/articleshow/125044761.cms,"'Yes, We Have Secret Plans': Trump's Fiery Response To Reporter On Strikes On Venezuela | Watch

Is Russia behind this decision?

What is Tomahawk missiles?

Will not giving missiles to Ukraine weaken its fight against Russia?





US President Donald Trump said on Sunday aboard Air Force One that, for now, he was not considering a deal to allow Ukraine to obtain long-range Tomahawk missiles for use against Russia.Trump was cool to a plan for the United States to sell Tomahawks to NATO nations that would transfer them to Ukraine, saying he did not want to escalate the war. His latest comments to reporters indicated he remained reluctant.“No, not really,” Trump told reporters as he flew to Washington from Palm Beach, Florida, when asked whether he was considering a deal to sell the missiles. He added, however, that he could change his mind.He and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte had discussed the Tomahawk idea when they met at the White House on October 22.Rutte said on Friday that the issue was under review and that it was up to the United States to decide.Earlier, Russia had raised the issue of Washington supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine and warned that such military support could harm US–Russia relations and adversely affect any peace process.The US President later told journalists at the White House that he had spoken to Putin about Tomahawk missiles. “I did actually say to him, ‘Would you mind if I gave a couple of thousands of Tomahawks to your opposition?’ I did say that to him,” Trump told reporters, adding that Putin did not appear to like that idea.“What do you think he’s [Putin’s] going to say, ‘Please sell Tomahawks?’ No, he doesn’t want Tomahawks to be supplied to Ukraine,” he added.According to US defence information, Tomahawk missiles were developed in the 1970s. They are long-range cruise missiles launched from ships or submarines and are generally used for long-distance attacks. The Pentagon’s budget documents state that the missile can make “deep-strike” attacks on land and “uses a combination of inertial navigation, GPS, and terrain contour matching (TERCOM) or Digital Scene Matching Area Correlation (DSMAC) for precision guidance”.Tomahawks fly at supersonic speed at low altitudes – about 30 metres off the ground – and have a range of more than 1,250–2,500 km. They usually carry conventional warheads but can also carry nuclear ones.The US, United Kingdom, Netherlands and Australia have all used these missiles in combat.So far, the US has launched more than 2,300 Tomahawks from its ships and submarines during operations in Syria and Libya, among others.Possibly yes. The missiles’ long-range precision would allow Kyiv to strike Russia’s critical energy infrastructure, a key pillar of Moscow’s war economy, according to CSIS.A sustained campaign targeting oil and gas facilities could weaken Russia’s ability to fund and supply its war, potentially forcing it to negotiate.However, analysts caution that a handful of missiles won’t shift the balance — hundreds would be needed for meaningful impact. Even then, success would depend on consistent, focused strikes and the indirect effects trickling through Russia’s economy and public pressure.","US President Donald Trump said on Sunday he was not considering a deal to allow Ukraine to obtain long-range Tomahawk missiles for use against Russia.

He dismissed criticism of his immigration crackdown and blamed “the liberal judges that were put in by Biden and by Obama” for holding back the raids, according to a preview of the programme.CBS News anchor Norah O’Donnell said “Americans have been watching videos of ICE tackling a young mother, tear gas being used in a Chicago residential neighborhood, and the smashing of car windows,"" and asked, “You’re okay with those tactics?”Trump replied, ""I think they haven't gone far enough because we've been held back by the liberal judges that were put in by Biden and by Obama,"" and added, “Yeah, because you have to get the people out.”Trump also weighed in on the New York mayoral race, targeting “communist” front-runner Zohran Mamdani. “He’s far worse than a socialist,” the president said.O’Donnell asked, “Some people have described him as a left-wing version of you … charismatic, breaking the old rules. What do you think about that?”Trump quipped “Well, I think I’m a much better-looking person than him, right?”The “60 Minutes” interview comes weeks after Bari Weiss, a former opinion editor for the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times who founded the Free Press, became editor-in-chief of CBS News.Trump sued CBS parent company Paramount over a 2024 “60 Minutes” segment featuring then-vice president Kamala Harris.",US President Trump defended his administration’s ICE raids and argued “they haven’t gone far enough” in a “60 Minutes” interview that aired Sunday night.

The President pointed to the young girl and appeared to mouth, “Melania,” to reporters.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller were among the administration officials partaking in the festivities.Leavitt and her husband, Nicholas Riccio, brought their 1-year-old son in an adorable jack o’lantern outfit.Miller, wearing a suit and tie, was spotted trying to wrangle his young son, who appeared to be in a ghost costume, while his wife, Katie, held their other child, both dressed as skeletons.One of the most unusual costumes belonged to a boy who came dressed as a filthy toilet, with a “wide load” sign on the back. Trump seemed amused by the party pooper and gave him a chocolate bar. One of the most clever ensembles may have been a family who outfitted their wagon to look like a McDonald’s drive-thru.The Halloween event is an annual White House tradition. Last year, former President Joe Biden awkwardly pretended to bite several infants in the rope line, including one dressed up as a chicken.Perhaps the most memorable Trump Halloween moment took place in 2019, when he placed a candy bar on the head of a kid in a Minion costume during his first term. Trump did it again this year, with a youngster in an unidentified costume with particularly flat headgear.","The White House turned into a haunted mansion with a presidential twist on Thursday night.

Prince Andrew’s Royal Life ENDS: King Charles Forces Brother Out After Epstein Scandal

What happened

What is next for Andrew





King Charles III, on Thursday, has stripped his brother Andrew of his ‘prince’ title and has ordered him to vacate his Windsor residence, Royal Lodge.The move follows weeks of mounting pressure and public scrutiny over his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.“These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” the palace said, as cited by AP. “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”The announcement came amid mounting outrage after Virginia Giuffre, a key accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, reiterated her sexual assault allegations against Prince Andrew, claims that he continues to deny.The claims were detailed in her posthumously published memoir, where she recounts how Epstein allegedly trafficked her to have sex with Prince Andrew on three occasions, including twice when she was just 17.Andrew, 65, has consistently denied Giuffre’s allegations but withdrew from royal duties following a widely criticised BBC interview in November 2019, where he sought to defend himself against her claims.Also read: A look at Prince Andrew's former roles and crown perks he’s losing In 2022, he reached a multimillion-pound out-of-court settlement after Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit against him in New York. Though Andrew made no admission of guilt, he expressed regret for Giuffre’s suffering as a victim of sex trafficking.In a 2019 BBC interview, Andrew said he had known British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of media tycoon and former MP Robert Maxwell, since her university days.It was Maxwell who introduced him to her then-partner, Jeffrey Epstein, in 1999. The three maintained a close friendship, even after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for procuring a minor for prostitution and soliciting a prostitute.Andrew is also alleged to have personally invited Epstein and Maxwell to Balmoral, the Queen’s Scottish estate, that same year, as cited by The Independent.In June this year, Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison by a New York court for her role in recruiting and grooming teenage girls for Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse.In a separate development, reports this week also revealed that Prince Andrew had hosted Jeffrey Epstein at Royal Lodge during his daughter Beatrice’s birthday celebrations in 2006, just two months after a US arrest warrant was issued for Epstein over the sexual assault of a minor, as cited by the BBC.Andrew is expected to relocate to a property on the King’s private Sandringham estate in Norfolk, with the move to be privately funded by King Charles.His ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, will also vacate Royal Lodge and make her own living arrangements.Formal notice to surrender the lease at Royal Lodge was issued on Thursday, and Andrew’s move to Sandringham is expected to take place “as soon as practicable.” He will receive a private allowance from the King, while any additional income will be his own responsibility, as reported by The Guardian.Also read: King Charles boots Prince Andrew out of Windsor home, strips all titles over Epstein links Andrew’s daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, will keep their royal titles, and he remains eighth in line to the throne.It marks the most dramatic royal exit since 1936, when King Edward VIII abdicated the throne to marry twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson. The couple were granted the titles Duke and Duchess of Windsor and lived the rest of their lives in exile.In contrast, Prince Harry, despite stepping back from royal duties, moving to California, and his ongoing rift with the family, still retains his title as Prince and Duke of Sussex.","King Charles III has stripped Prince Andrew of his 'prince' title and ordered him to vacate his Windsor residence, Royal Lodge.

Thanksgiving travel at risk

What Happens if the Shutdown Continues?

Military:

Federal civilian workers:

Air traffic controllers:





Nearly a month into the shutdown, food banks across the country were straining to meet rising demand from hundreds of thousands of federal workers who were furloughed or working without pay and were bracing for an even bigger surge as benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program were set to lapse on Nov. 1.More than one in eight Americans depended on food stamps from SNAP, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Recipients received an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card to buy groceries, and many families relied on those benefits as their main source of money for food, CBS news reported.The Community Table Food Bank in Arvada, Colorado, was so inundated with people on Thursday that it had to temporarily close. Before it did, Danielle Brann, a SNAP recipient, obtained essentials including ham and crackers and cans of spaghetti sauce.“The line started at 9 o’clock this morning and I don’t remember ever seeing it this busy. I mean they’re turning people away. So it’s more of a demand for sure,” Brann said.In Delaware County, Pennsylvania, the Loaves and Fishes Food Pantry also had to turn people away on Tuesday because food was leaving the shelves faster than it could be restocked.Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that Americans could face a travel “disaster” as Thanksgiving approaches next month without an end in sight to the govt shutdown.Their comments came after Vance hosted a roundtable of aviation, travel and union leaders at the White House, during which they aired their concerns with the current state of the industry and worked out potential, temporary solutions to ease the strain on Federal Aviation Administration employees who were being forced to work without pay to ensure Americans could fly safely, two White House officials told CNN.“Look it could be a disaster. It really could be, because at that point you’re talking about people have missed three paychecks. They’ve missed four paychecks. How many of them are not going to show up for work?” Vance said.“That’s going to lead to massive delays. We want people to be able to get home for Thanksgiving. We want people to be able to travel for business,” he continued.Air traffic control staffing problems spiked over the weekend, raising concerns about growing disruption Duffy added, “Our traffic will be snarled, but it will be a disaster in aviation.”More than a million active-duty service members in the United States would have missed their pay cheques on Friday if the Trump administration will not intervene, BBC reported.About a quarter of military families were considered food insecure, and 15% relied on Snap or food pantries, according to research firm Rand. Meanwhile, the Military Family Advisory Network estimated that 27% of families had £380 or less in emergency savings.The Pentagon said it had accepted a $130m gift from a wealthy donor to help pay salaries during the shutdown, which worked out to $100 for each of the 1.3 million service members expecting to be paid.The White House planned to pay the troops on 31 October by using money from a military housing fund, a research-and-development account and a defence procurement fund, according to Axios.Earlier this month the administration made payroll by moving $6.5bn from military research. More than 160 families told the National Military Family Association that they had been underpaid during the shutdown, some by hundreds of dollars and others by thousands.If the shutdown continues, then some 4.5 million paycheques would have been withheld from civilian employees, representing about $21bn in missing wages, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.Furloughed employees were typically paid after shutdowns ended, although Trump had threatened to withhold pay and was attempting to fire thousands of workers, a move being challenged in court.Thousands of air traffic controllers missed their first paycheques this week. And if it continues, then the flight delay will also continue.Because they are considered essential workers, the workers must continue to do their jobs without pay during the shutdown. Since 1 October, numerous controllers have called in sick and now many report they are getting second jobs.","More than one in eight Americans depended on food stamps from SNAP, according to the US Department of Agriculture.

""Frankly, Andrew's name has come up many times from the victims,"" he told Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday.""So he clearly has knowledge of what happened and we just want him to come forward and tell us what he knows.""He added: ""No matter who it is - American or not - everyone should be looked at.""Fellow committee member Raja Krishnamoorthi told BBC Newsnight he would be willing to formally summon Andrew with a subpoena, although he conceded this would be difficult to enforce while he was outside of the US.","Donald Trump said he felt ""badly"" for the UK royal family after Andrew Mountbatten Windsor was stripped of his titles.

What is the Hindu-Christian row?



Dinesh D'Souza stirs controversy with his story of conversion







The Hindu-Christian row triggered by Vice President JD Vance refuses to die down as commentators unravel several aspects of what he said about his religion and his wife's religion, and then what he said in defence. Indian-origin Christian MAGA activist Dinesh D'Souza who supported JD Vance in his hope that Usha Vance one day embraces Christianity said Hindus should have no problem if Usha Vance converts to Christianity if Hinduism is truly inclusive.At a Turning Point USA event, JD Vance said he hopes to see his wife embrace his faith. “As I’ve told her, and as I’ve said publicly, and as I’ll say now in front of 10,000 of my closest friends: do I hope, eventually, that she is somehow moved by the same thing I was moved by in church? Yes. I honestly do wish that, because I believe in the Christian gospel and I hope that eventually my wife comes to see it the same way,"" JD Vance said.""But if she doesn’t, God says that everybody has free will, so that doesn’t cause a problem with me. That’s something that you work out with your friends, your family, the person you most love,"" JD Vance said.Two major criticisms followed: one, as he called his Hindu wife an agnostic and two, overall for undermining his wife's Hindu faith.JD Vance defended what he said and explained that Christians do want to share their faith with others and it is a completely normal thing. ""My Christian faith tells me the Gospel is true and is good for human beings. My wife--as I said at the TPUSA--is the most amazing blessing I have in my life. She herself encouraged me to re-engage with my faith many years ago. She is not a Christian and has no plans to convert, but like many people in an interfaith marriage--or any interfaith relationship--I hope she may one day see things as I do. Regardless, I'll continue to love and support her and talk to her about faith and life and everything else, because she's my wife,"" JD Vance said, repeating that he would love it if Usha Vance converts to Christianity.Mumbai-born MAGA activist Dinesh D'Souza, in his attempt to support JD Vance, created another controversy as he spoke about the conversion of his ancestors to Christianity. He said they must have been so oppressed because of being low cast that they chose to convert to Christianity. However, this account was proved to be false as he himself wrote in his book that his grandfather told him they were Brahmins.","Vice President JD Vance said he hopes to see his wife embrace his faith.

A preview of President Trump's interview with 60 Minutes to be aired tonight has been dropped, showing how CBS’s Norah O’Donnell presses Trump on China and Taiwan.“One potential flashpoint with China — and probably the potential flash point with China in the coming years — is over the issue of Taiwan,” O’Donnell said. “The Chinese military is encroaching on Taiwan’s sea lanes, its airspace, its cyberspace. I know you have said that Xi Jinping wouldn’t dare move militarily on Taiwan while you’re in office. But what if he does? Would you order US Forces to defend Taiwan?”“You’ll find out if it happens,” Trump replied. “And he understands the answer to that. This never even came up yesterday as a subject. He never brought it up. People were a little surprised that he never brought it up because he understands it. And he understands it very well.”“Do you mind if I ask, when you say he understands, why not communicate that publicly to the rest of us?” O’Donnell replied. “What does he understand? What does he understand?”“I can’t give away my secrets,” Trump said. “I don’t want to be one of these guys that tells you exactly what’s going to happen if something happens. The other side knows, but I’m not somebody that tells everything because you’re asking me a question, but they understand what’s gonna happen.And he has openly said, and his people have openly said at meetings, we would never do anything while President Trump is president because they know the consequences. ”Trump met Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the APEC Summit in Busan, South Korea, on October 30. ""My G2 meeting with President Xi of China was a great one for both of our countries. This meeting will lead to everlasting peace and success. God bless both China and the USA!""

Bowen Yang’s comeback as George Santos





It was a typical Saturday Night Live moment until it wasn’t. During this week’s Weekend Update, Colin Jost shocked viewers with a controversial joke about Donald Trump’s Halloween video, turning light political satire into one of the edgiest moments of the season. The segment featured a clip of President Trump and First Lady Melania walking out of the White House to a cover of Michael Jackson’s Thriller. Jost then quipped that it was “the perfect soundtrack to lure kids to a famous mansion,” drawing both laughter and audible groans from the audience.The viral moment began when SNL played a short clip from Trump’s recent Halloween event, where the former president used Thriller as background music while greeting guests outside the White House. What was intended as a playful, seasonal appearance became the setup for Jost’s risqué punchline, which referenced the late pop star’s long-standing child abuse allegations and Trump’s own controversial links to convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.The comment hit a nerve, quickly spreading across social media as viewers debated whether the joke was clever political commentary or an unnecessary low blow.Inside Studio 8H, the crowd’s response was mixed. Some viewers burst into laughter, while others groaned at the bluntness of Jost’s remark. The comedian smirked through the tension, seemingly unfazed by the divided reaction. Co-anchor Michael Che followed with his own attempt to top the joke, targeting Trump again with a line about his newly renovated White House bathroom during the ongoing government shutdown.Che later leaned into the dark humour further, joking about the New York City mayoral race and even invoking the “9/11” meme, a move that drew gasps and laughter in equal measure.For decades, Saturday Night Live has balanced satire and controversy, using Weekend Update as its sharpest political weapon. From Chevy Chase mocking Gerald Ford’s clumsiness in the 1970s to Alec Baldwin’s portrayal of Trump in recent years, SNL’s humour has often walked a fine line between wit and offence.Jost and Che, who have co-anchored Weekend Update since 2014, are known for their contrasting comedic styles: Jost’s sharp political commentary paired with Che’s darker, more provocative humour. Their chemistry often relies on pushing boundaries, and this week’s episode was no exception.The segment also featured SNL star Bowen Yang’s return as former Congressman George Santos, who recently had his prison sentence commuted by Trump. In his first appearance since the news, Yang’s Santos claimed prison had changed him and vowed to “only tell the truth.” The skit quickly spiralled into absurdity when Santos declared he was Black, a callback to his character’s history of outrageous lies.The sketch provided some levity after Jost’s edgy opener, reminding viewers of SNL’s knack for mixing political satire with over-the-top character work.","Saturday Night Live co-anchor Colin Jost shocked viewers with a controversial joke about Donald Trump’s Halloween video.

"The return of the G-2 duopoly: US, China embrace leaves India out in the cold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-return-of-the-g-2-duopoly-us-china-embrace-leaves-india-out-in-the-cold/articleshow/125036540.cms,"The TOI correspondent from Washington:

Trump In SHOCK As China First Praises Xi-Trump Meeting, Then Torches US’ ‘Brutal Blockade’ | Watch





In what appears to be a tectonic shift in American foreign policy and world order, US President Donald Trump has openly embraced China as a functional equal, heralding a new duopoly that jettisons Washington’s decade-plus view of Beijing as an existential threat, while leaving other powers like EU, Russia, India, and Japan as also-rans.Shortly after announcing “THE G2 WILL BE CONVENING SHORTLY!” ahead of his meeting with China’s President Xi Jinping last week, Trump doubled down on the formulation on Saturday, confirming that it is more than a tactical ploy. “My G2 meeting with President Xi of China was a great one for both of our countries. This meeting will lead to everlasting peace and success. God bless both China and the USA!” he posted on X.US defense secretary Pete Hegseth followed Trump’s post, saying he agreed with the President that the relationship between the US and China “has never been better.” After Trump’s meeting with Xi, Hegseth said he had an “equally positive meeting” with his counterpart, China’s minister of national defense Admiral Dong Jun in Malaysia, where incidentally he also signed a ten-year defense framework agreement with India’s defence minister Rajnath Singh.“The (Chinese) Admiral and I agree that peace, stability, and good relations are the best path for our two great and strong countries.As President Trump said, his historic “G2 meeting” set the tone for everlasting peace and success for the US and China. The Department of War will do the same — peace through strength, mutual respect, and positive relations. God bless both China and the USA!” Hegseth said in a post. A China-phobic Fox News host not so long ago, Hegseth said Dong and he agreed to set up military-to-military channels to deconflict and deescalate any problems that arise and they would have more meetings on the subject coming soon.The twin statements constituted an astonishing turnaround by an administration that held the view going back to the first Trump term that China was a hostile adversary that had “ripped off the US, “stolen” its technology, and needed to be challenged and contained if not defeated. As recently as May this year, CIA Deputy Director Michael Ellis explicitly stated, ""China is the existential threat to American security in a way that we really have never confronted before. "" Several MAGA lawmakers, notably Tom Cotton, who heads the Senate intelligence Committee, are anti-China hardliners who have gone to the extent of wanting to expel Chinese students from U.S universities for purported spying.The term “G-2” in relation to China was first coined during the Bush era by the economist C. Fred Bergsten. Also dubbed Chimerica by the historian Niall Ferguson), it proposed a hypothetical U.S.–China condominium to establish a ""systematically cooperative relationship"" aimed at addressing challenges like trade imbalances, climate change, and financial stability. The idea faded during the Obama era when China came to be seen as a belligerent power and Washington decided to support India’s rise as a counterweight to China. After Trump took office in 2017, China was subjected to bitter invective, including being blamed for the pandemic.The immediate reason for the turnaround, according to the Washington punditocracy, is the economic and diplomatic setback Trump faced after he launched a tariff war against China and found that Beijing held the aces. Despite his characteristic bravado and bluster in projecting his meeting with Xi as a win-win, almost across the board, the global commentariat is almost unanimous in concluding that Trump has made more concessions than China after unleashing a tariff war.A Financial Times report on the Trump-Xi summit ran with the headline “China emerges as a peer-rival” to the US. The Associated Press also concluded that Trump gained little in the talks, concluding, the “deal between the US and China is undoing damage from a self-inflicted trade war”.The immediate casualty of this bipolar framing is the rest of the world, including once-influential players such as the European Union, Russia, and India, which now find themselves relegated to secondary status in a US–China duopoly. In fact, Beijing’s official readout from the summit echoed the US sentiment: “China and the United States can jointly shoulder our responsibility as major countries and accomplish great things for the good of our two countries and the world. ”","US President Donald Trump has openly embraced China as a functional equal. The move jettisons Washington’s decade-plus view of Beijing as an existential threat. EU, Russia, India, and Japan are left as also-rans in the new duopoly.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125036545,imgsize-922678,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
