‘Modi can influence the end of war’: Zelenskyy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/modi-can-influence-the-end-of-war-zelenskyy/articleshow/114667946.cms,"Zelensky Questions BRICS Unity After Summit Boosts Vladimir Putin’s Image Amid Ongoing Conflict

“PM Modi can influence the end of the Ukraine war . This is the huge value of him in any conflict. This is the huge value of India,” said Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an exclusive interview to the Times of India. When asked about the possibility of PM Modi holding negotiations between Ukraine and Russia , Zelenskyy gave his strongest signal yet, “Undoubtedly it can be in India and PM Modi can really do that… but I think we need to prepare ourselves … and only according to our format because the war is in our land… we have the platform which is the peace summit.”Ukrainian forces have been under pressure in recent months with Russia making advances in the Donbas region. Add to this the uncertainty posed by the upcoming presidential elections in US where a Trump victory might see Kyiv lose vital American support. Washington is Kyiv’s biggest source of military aid and any cut in this support will be a huge setback for Ukraine. Kyiv already faces restrictions in using American supplied long-range weapons to hit Russian military targets deep inside Russia. With winter coming and Russia continuing to hit Ukrainian energy infrastructure, Kyiv is looking at another bleak few months.“This is the third hard winter for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people… We are step-by-step strengthening our energy systems and aren’t just going to allow Russia to kill our people,” said Zelenskyy. Asked about his recently revealed Victory Plan and Nato membership for Ukraine, Zelenskyy emphasised that it was a bid to strengthen Ukraine as a bridge to peace negotiations to end the war. “The Victory Plan is not a bargaining chip or a topic of negotiations with Russia… We are not asking for quick Nato membership because that is not possible during the war … What we are asking for is invitation to Nato so that in the future nobody can change their opinion.”Zelenskyy was also critical about the recent Brics summit in Russia calling it a failure and citing the absence of some countries at the leaders’ level including those from Saudi Arabia and Brazil. “Putin wants to divide the world into so-called West-plus and Brics-plus… Even the (peace) proposals of Brazil and China were not acceptable to him… This was a slap for China and Brazil.”On Modi’s statement that he is ready to work to bring peace in Ukraine, Zelenskyy called for action, not mere words. “Modi is the PM of a really huge country… Such a country cannot just say we are interested in the end of the war… PM Modi can influence the end of the war… blocking of Russian economy, blocking of cheap energy resource, blocking of defence-industrial complex of Russia will lead to the decrease in capacity of Moscow to wage wars against us.”Specifically, Zelenskyy asked Modi for help to bring back Ukrainian children forcibly deported to Russia, “You can force Putin to bring back Ukrainian children… PM Modi can use his influence and tell Putin just give me 1,000 Ukrainian children who will be brought back to Ukraine. Let PM Modi bring back at least 1,000 Ukrainian children.”",Ukrainian forces have been under pressure in recent months with Russia making advances in the Donbas region.

The three steps to digital security are: stop, think and act. If possible, take a screenshot or record the call. No govt agency issues threats over the phone or demands money,” he said, adding that investigating agencies were working in partnership with state govts to combat the scam being carried out in the name of ‘digital arrest’ but awareness was essential in protecting oneself from such fraudsters.“As soon as you get a call, stop... don’t panic, stay calm, don’t take any hasty steps, don’t give away your personal information to anyone; if possible, take a screenshot and record it for sure. The first step is ‘stop’ and the second step is ‘think’. No govt agency threatens you on the phone like this, neither inquires nor demands money on a video call like this,” Modi said.The third step was ‘take action’, the PM said and urged victims to dial the national cyber helpline 1930 and also report such incidents on cybercrime.gov.in. He urged people to inform family and police, and preserve evidence by recording the fraud call.During his broadcast, he also shared a conversation between a victim and a fraudster to highlight the ‘digital arrest’ scam.“The fraudsters of digital arrest phone calls, at times impersonate as police, CBI, narcotics, at times RBI... using such various labels, they converse as fake officers with a lot of confidence. Many listeners of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ have wished that we must discuss that,” Modi said.He reiterated that there was no system like digital arrest in the law and this was just a fraud, deceit and a lie. The gang of criminals and those who doing this are enemies of society, Modi said.Modi also said the effort for an ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ was making strides in every sector, noting that the country was exporting its defence products to over 85 countries now.","PM Narendra Modi flagged the issue of fraudsters targeting people through ‘ digital arrests ’ as he clarified that no govt agency threatened individuals over the phone or demanded money.

Recital of Urdu Ramayan heralds Bikaner’s Diwali,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/recital-of-urdu-ramayan-heralds-bikaners-diwali/articleshow/114665730.cms,"JAIPUR: Diwali in Rajasthan ’s desert city of Bikaner is a spectacle of light illuminated by an epic tradition of heralding the festival with a recital of the Urdu Ramayan , a Muslim professor’s labour of love and scholarship dating back to 1935.Over the past 12 years, this event centred on Maulvi Badshah Shah Hussain Rana Lakhnavi ’s presentation of the story of Lord Ram in Urdu has become an indispensable part of Bikaner’s annual celebration of the triumph of good over evil in more ways than one. Urdu Ramayan, seen as a testament to the spirit of Ram’s legend transcending faith, was born out of a nationwide competition organised by Banaras Hindu University (BHU) 89 years ago to commemorate Tulsidas Jayanti.Rana Lakhnavi, a professor of Urdu in Bikaner at the time, participated in the competition and won a gold medal from the university. The erstwhile Maharaja Ganga Singh arranged a ceremony at Nagari Bhandar to listen to Rana Lakhnavi’s version. Urdu litterateur Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru presented gold medal to him on BHU’s behalf at the same event.Rana Lakhnavi used to be an employee of the royal family of Bikaner between 1913 and 1919, during which time he was entrusted with the responsibility of translating orders issued by the Mughal rulers from Persian to Urdu.The erstwhile ruler of Bikaner, Ganga Singh, later appointed him as an Urdu teacher at Dungar College. He also wrote poetry and continued to be involved in literary activities until his death in 1943 in his native village of Sandli near Lucknow.Dr Zia-Ul-Hasan Qadri, an Urdu teacher and organiser of the Bikaner event, said Rana Lakhnavi’s Urdu Ramayan was the only available complete version of the epic in Urdu. Its beauty lies in the couplets that vividly describe scenes from Ramayan, including the battle against Ravan.At this year’s recitation days before Diwali, Qadri recited couplets from Rana Lakhnavi’s translation that captivated the audience.“Thode din mein jang ke bhi saaz o saman ho gaye, khoon se rangeen biyaban ho gaye/Ye bhi kuch zakhmi ho gaye, kuch woh bhi zakhmi ho gaye, katl-e-Ravan ke sab aasaar numayan ho gaye,” reads one of the couplets.Bikaner Paryatan Lekhak Sangh’s “Mehfil-e-Adab” is as much a call for amity as it is a homage to the legend of Ram and Rana Lakhnavi’s craft.Mukul Chaturvedi, a professor at Delhi’s Zakir Hussain College, has reproduced the text of Rana Lakhnavi’s book in English. It was published in Sahitya Akademi’s bimonthly journal in March-April 2022.",Diwali in Rajasthan’s desert city of Bikaner heralds the festival with a recital of the Urdu Ramayan.

""None can paint TVK with a certain colour or call us a 'B team' of another party. Because everyone knows who we are against when we declared our fundamental principle as Pirapokkum ella uyirkum (all are equal by birth),"" he said.

MUMBAI: The crime branch on Saturday said that the plot to murder NCP leader and former state minister Baba Siddiqui was coordinated from Canada by gangster Anmol Bishnoi , the brother of jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi.Police said this came out during interrogation of two accused — Ramphool Kanjoia and Nitin Sapre. Anmol Bishnoi coordinated the attack through another accused, Sujit Sushilsingh alias Dabbu, said police. According to sources, Dabbu arranged for weapons from Rajasthan and provided financial support to the attackers. He instructed the hired shooters to conduct recee of Siddiqui's residence and surroundings a month prior to the murder.

Kamala Harris McDonalds: Photo of Kamala Harris in McDonald's dress going viral. Is it real?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/photo-of-kamala-harris-in-mcdonalds-dress-going-viral-is-it-real/articleshow/114634790.cms,"The truth of Kamala Harris' McDonald's stint

What McDonald's said

A photo of a young Kamala Harris donning a blue dress apparently of McDonald's when she did a stint there has gone viral. But MAGA supporters pointed out that it was a doctored image shared mostly by pro-Kamala Harris accounts on X. They shared the original image of a McDonald's staff which they claimed had been manipulated to put Kamala Harris' face.Working at McDonald's emerged as a key flashpoint between the GOP and the Democrats as Donald Trump claimed Kamala Harris lied about working at McDonald's 41 years ago. To emulate her 'false claim', Donald Trump last Sunday worked a shift at a McDonald's outlet in Pennsylvania and said he worked 15 minutes more than Kamala Harris because Kamala Harris never worked at any McDonald's -- as there is no record of it.“We have checked with McDonald’s, and they say, definitively, that there is no record of Lyin’ Kamala Harris ever having worked there,” Trump wrote after his McDonald's shift. “In other words, she never worked there, and has lied about this ‘job’ for years.”Kamala Harris said she worked at a Bay Area McDonald's 41 years ago when she was in college in the summer of 1983. But the Trump campaign claimed that there has been no record of Kamala Harris working at McDonald's she claimed and hence she lied. But reports said it was a pre-digital era and no record found may not hint at 'never worked'.McDonald's said it is true that no records of Harris' employment exist but this is not an aberration and not a reason to think that she didn't work at a McDonald's. ""Though we are not a political brand, we’ve been proud to hear former President Trump’s love for McDonald’s and Vice President Harris’s fond memories working under the Arches. While we and our franchisees don’t have records for all positions dating back to the early ’80s, what makes ‘1 in 8’ so powerful is the shared experience so many Americans have had.""",Kamala Harris said she worked at a Bay Area McDonald's 41 years ago when she was in college in the summer of 1983.

He was very scared. To ensure he did not break down or resort to some extreme step, I kept talking to him on my personal mobile. I also collected his neighbour’s number and ensured someone reached out to his family. I hung up the call only after his family reached the lodge and picked him up,” Ganesh told TOI.Later, thanking the cons table, the victim told police it was only because of his (Ganesh) help and guidance that he didn’t lose money.Recounting the ordeal, the victim told cops he had his phone constantly plugged to the charger and was not allowed to disconnect the video for a second, even when he went to the restroom.“Though the call did get disconnected a couple of times, the fraudsters called back. It was only on Sunday morning that I managed to reach the cyber crime cops,” he said.

Now, I am running around like a fugitive with no probable future."" This sentiment reflects the struggles many BCL affiliates are experiencing.The unrest began in July when students protested against a controversial reservation system in government jobs, which they claimed favored supporters of the ruling party. Although the top court abolished the quota, the protests escalated, calling for the removal of Hasina’s government due to alleged human rights violations.Protesters stormed government buildings, including Hasina’s residence on August 5, forcing her to flee the country. Violence continued even after her departure, with Awami League members and students becoming targets. Many went into hiding or were detained.Shahreen Ariana and Saikat Raihan, BCL leaders from Rajshahi University, were arrested on October 18 on alleged “forged charges,” as reported by their families. Violence against Awami League-affiliated students spread, with incidents like the beating death of Shamim Ahmed and the mob killing of Masud.The interim government declared BCL banned under the Anti-Terrorism Act 2009, effective October 23. The law was originally enacted by Hasina's administration.For over a decade, BCL dominated campuses, while opposition student wings such as the Chhatra Dal and Islami Chhatra Shibir faced significant challenges.The Yunus government has since lifted the ban on Shibir, allowing opposition student groups to regain control of campuses.","Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) is the student wing of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League (AL) BCL members now find themselves in hiding, facing actions taken by the interim government.

That was down from the 279 seats they held previously and marked the coalition's worst election result since it briefly lost power in 2009. ""This election has been very tough for us,"" a sombre-looking Ishiba said. Komeito's Keiichi Ishii, who took over as that party's new chief last month, lost in his district.The biggest winner of the night, the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), had 143 seats so far, up from 98 previously, as voters punished Ishiba's party over a funding scandal and inflation. The outcome may force parties into fractious power-sharing deals to rule, potentially ushering in instability. A party needs 233 seats for majority.""This is not the end, but the beginning,"" CDPJ leader Yoshihiko Noda said, adding that his party would work with other opposition parties to aim for a change of govt. Ishiba said he would wait until the final results, likely due in the early hours of Monday, before considering potential coalitions or other power-sharing deals.The PM had called the snap poll immediately after being elected to head the party last month, hoping to win a public mandate for his premiership. His predecessor, Fumio Kishida, quit after his support fell due to anger over a cost of living crunch and the scandal involving unrecorded donations to lawmakers. The election also took place nine days before voters in the US - Japan's closest ally - head to the polls in another unpredictable ballot.The LDP has governed Japan for all but four years since 1955. It has held an outright majority since it returned to power in 2012 after a brief spell of opposition rule. It also lost office briefly in 1993, when a coalition of seven opposition parties formed a govt that lasted less than a year.

MAGA megaphone Donald Trump is claiming that Google CEO Sundar Pichai called him to convey accolades on his visit to McDonald's , amid reports that big-tech CEOs and billionaires are ""seeing the writing on the wall"" in the Presidential elections and therefore folding before Trump to avoid retribution.""I actually got a call from Sundar...the head of Google and he said, sir, I just want to tell you what you did with McDonald's was one of the single biggest events we've ever had at Google,"" Trump claimed at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, repeating an assertion he made hours before on the Joe Rogan podcast.Trump has previously claimed such supplicatory calls from Apple's Tim Cook and Facebook/META's Mark Zuckerberg. As with Pichai, they too have refrained from confirming or denying the calls, likely so as to not offend the tetchy former President.Claiming calls from and conversations with prominent figures, including foreign leaders, has long been a Trump tactic. Some critics see them as fictional or hyperbolic or an inaccurate or self-aggrandizing rendering of the exchanges since they remain unconfirmed and uncontested.Trump frequently relates how he warned France's President Emmanuel Macron that would impose retaliatory tariffs on French wines and champagne if France did the same to American automobile industry, forcing him to back down. He also claims to have warned a Taliban leader, whom he refers to only by the first name ""Abdul,"" that he would bomb his house if US troops in Afghanistan are attacked.He once claimed, at a White House meeting with then Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, that India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked him to mediate on the Kashmir issue, forcing New Delhi to refute the claim. Such an invitation would be a departure from New Delhi's long-standing position that it is a bilateral matter, a stand successive US administrations have embraced.Typically, foreign leaders and business honchos who Trump claims made conciliatory calls, do not confirm the conversation -- likely so as to not offend him. But Trump's MAGA acolytes see these uncontested claims as proof of Trump's impending victory.""They’re either all trying to keep up with Elon Musk or they’re trying to get ahead of something they see coming,"" Charlie Kirk, a prominent Trump supporter and MAGA talking head, said on X. Another Trump supporter noted that ""when Fortune 500 CEOs start aligning towards the end of the election cycle, that should give everyone some indication of what's coming..these people have more skin in the game and know better to align early.""Trump has been unhappy with Google for some time now and has openly complained that it illegally uses a system to show only bad stories about him while featuring only good stories about Kamala Harris. He has also called for Justice Department prosecution of Google, failing which, he has warned he will do so ""when I win the elections.""Trump's claim of Pichai's outreach comes on the heels of two of America's largest dailies, Washington Post and Los Angeles Times, owned by billionaires Jeff Bezos and Patrick Soon-Shiong respectively, spiking endorsements for Kamala Harris drafted by its editorial teams.",Donald Trump claims Google CEO Sundar Pichai called him to convey accolades on his visit to McDonald's. Trump has previously claimed supplicatory calls from Apple's Tim Cook and Facebook/META's Mark Zuckerberg. Trump's MAGA acolytes see these uncontested claims as proof of Trump's impending victory.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114643356,imgsize-893076,width-400,resizemode-4/114643356.jpg"
Sean Diddy List: Names of celebrities connected to Sean Combs viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/diddy-list-names-of-celebrities-connected-to-sean-combs-viral/articleshow/113609942.cms,"No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around.Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home compared him to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that Diddy was part of the same social circle as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Instead, he focused on developing Zip2, a software company that was eventually sold for approximately $300 million in 1999.Two immigration law experts interviewed by the Post suggested that Musk would have been required to be enrolled in a full course of study to maintain a valid work authorisation as a student.Leon Fresco, a former immigration litigator at the Justice Department, said that international students are prohibited from leaving their studies to establish a business, ""even if they are not immediately getting paid."" He explained to The Post that engaging in activities that contribute to generating revenue, such as coding or attempting to make sales, can lead to legal consequences for these students.""If you do anything that helps to facilitate revenue creation, such as design code or try to make sales in furtherance of revenue creation, then you’re in trouble,"" Fresco told The Post.Musk did not respond to requests for comment sent to four of his companies - SpaceX, Tesla, the social media company X and The Boring Company - nor did Musk's lawyer Alex Spiro.In a 2020 podcast cited by the Post, Musk said: ""I was legally there, but I was meant to be doing student work.

Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe drew ire, for his statements at a rally for President Donald Trump at Madison Square Garden . Hichcliffe on Sunday referred to Puerto Rico as ""floating island of garbage"". His statements invited criticism of Democrats and were labelled as 'racist'.Hinchcliffe, who hosts the live podcast ""Kill Tony,"" addressed the crowd and stated, ""There’s a lot going on. I don’t know if you know this, but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico.""Hinchcliffe responded to the crowd’s reaction by laughing and stating, ""okay, we’re getting there, again, normally I don’t follow the national anthem.”Hinchcliife also took aim at Latinos while addressing the crowd. Introducing the Republican party as the “party with a good sense of humour,” he began, “I welcome migrants to the United States with open arms and by open arms, I mean like this,” while signalling “no” with his hand gestures.He went on, “It’s wild and these Latinos love making babies too, just know that — they don’t do that. They come inside, just like they did to our country. Republicans are the party with a good sense of humour.”Hinchcliffe also compared Travis Kelce with OJ Simpson. He said, ""I don’t know about you guys, but I think Travis Kelce might be the next OJ Simpson,” he said at one point. “Every day, the Democrat Party looks more like a Diddy Party!""Ridiculing the MAGA speaker, Walz said, “When you have some a-hole calling Puerto Rico ‘floating garbage,’ know that that's what they think about you. It's what they think about anyone who makes less money than them… I want every Puerto Rican in Philadelphia and Reading and across the country to see this clip.”Democratic leaders condemned the recent comment made by a Comedy Central personality. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) expressed her disapproval on social media platform X. She stated, ""You’re opening for Trump by calling Puerto Rico a floating pile of garbage. 4,000+ Puerto Ricans died under him.""This criticism joins other Democrats who echoed similar sentiments about the comedian's remarks. They condemned the remarks as inappropriate and insensitive.Comedian Hinchcliffe responded to criticism on social media platform X after being accused of making a joke seen as racist. He argued that his joke was taken out of context, and commented on the involvement of a vice presidential candidate in the controversy.“These people have no sense of humour. Wild that a vice presidential candidate would take time out of his ‘busy schedule’ to analyze a joke taken out of context to make it seem racist. I love Puerto Rico and vacation there. I made fun of everyone…watch the whole set. I’m a comedian Tim…might be time to change your tampon,” Hinchcliffe wrote on X.Hinchcliffe emphasized his respect for Puerto Rico and defended his comedic style, stating that his remarks were part of a larger set that included jokes about various groups.","Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe drew ire, for his statements at a rally for President Donald Trump at Madison Square Garden.

Trump plans to invoke the Alien Enemy Act if re-elected — What powers does it give him?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-plans-to-invoke-the-alien-enemy-act-if-re-elected-what-powers-does-it-give-him/articleshow/114671733.cms,"What is the Alien Enemy Act?

What power does US President get from Alien Enemy Act?



Detention and deportation: The President can detain or deport any male over 14 years old from an enemy nation if they are considered a potential threat.

Restrictions on movement and property: The President may also impose limitations on where these individuals can travel or require them to report regularly to government authorities.

Protection measures: The Act enables measures that, theoretically, protect the US by controlling or mitigating potential risks posed by foreign nationals from hostile nations.

Former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Monday doubled down on his anti-immigration rhetoric, calling for the reintroduction of antiquated laws and the death penalty for migrants who commit violent crimes against American citizens or law enforcement officers.Speaking at a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York, Trump said that he plans to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.“I will invoke the Alien Enemy Act of 1798... think of that. That’s how far back... they had law and order… They had some tough ones. Get ready,” he told supporters.The law, dating back over two centuries, allows for the deportation of foreign nationals from enemy countries during wartime, underscoring Trump’s proposed approach to combat illegal immigration .The Alien Enemies Act, part of the Alien and Sedition Acts passed in 1798 by a Federalist-controlled Congress, aimed to regulate immigrants amidst rising tensions with France. Anticipating conflict, the act empowered the President to detain or deport foreign nationals from enemy countries during wartime, targeting recent immigrants who might align with US adversaries.Primarily directed at immigrants from France and Ireland, who were largely pro-French, the Alien laws raised the naturalization period from 5 to 14 years, authorized the detention of foreign nationals from enemy countries, and allowed the President to expel any alien deemed a security threat. Unlike other laws in the series, which restricted speech and extended citizenship requirements, the Alien Enemies Act remained in effect long-term, granting future presidents similar powers in subsequent conflicts.This act was one of the first to leverage immigration control as a national security measure.Earlier in Aurora, Colorado, Trump had announced "" Operation Aurora ,"" a proposed national initiative targeting undocumented migrants if he were to be re-elected. Addressing supporters in Aurora, Trump accused Vice President Kamala Harris of enabling illegal immigration, saying, “Kamala has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons of the Third World.” He described Aurora as ""overrun"" by Venezuelan gang members, despite local officials, including Republicans, refuting such claims.""I'm hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer,"" Trump declared to the enthusiastic crowd in Aurora. Referring to a supposed “invasion” at the southern border, he called the United States “occupied America” and pledged mass deportations if re-elected.“November 5, 2024, will be liberation day in America,” he vowed, tying his promise to the election date.The former president’s portrayal of immigration as a national crisis comes despite statistics from the Aurora Police Department showing a decline in major crime rates since last year. Trump continued to characterize migrants as a threat, using language that suggested they posed a public health risk. “They’re very sick, very sick. They’re coming into our country… very, very sick with highly contagious disease,” he claimed.This rhetoric follows unproven claims Trump made at a previous rally, where he alleged that Haitian migrants in Springfield were “killing and eating pets”—a statement state authorities have dismissed as baseless.",The Alien Enemy Act of 1798 allows the President to detain or deport foreign nationals from enemy countries during wartime. It was passed in 1798 by a Federalist-controlled Congress to regulate immigrants amidst rising tensions with France. The act was one of the first to leverage immigration control as a national security measure.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114672106,imgsize-985473,width-400,resizemode-4/114672106.jpg"
How voting before Election Day became so widespread and so political,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-voting-before-election-day-became-so-widespread-and-so-political/articleshow/114671708.cms,"(AP photo)

What is advance voting?

What are the different types of advance voting?

When did advance voting begin?

Does one political party use advance voting more than the other?

What led to the partisan split in advance voting?

What will advance voting look like in 2024?

WASHINGTON: Voters had plenty to argue about in the 1972 election, but they overwhelmingly agreed that when it came time to vote, they would do so in person on Election Day .The act of voting was largely a communal experience that year, when roughly 95% of voters went to their local polling places and completed and submitted their ballots in person on a single day, according to a census survey at the time.That number would fall gradually over the next 50 years as states provided Americans with more options on how and when to vote.By 2022, only about half of the electorate voted at the polls on Election Day. The share of people voting before Election Day spiked to more than 70% in 2020, and votes cast by mail surpassed those cast on Election Day for the first time ever. That year, many states enacted emergency measures to temporarily expand vote-by-mail options to protect voters from the spread of Covid-19.""We've been on an upward trend of early voting over time as more states have adopted early voting options and voters have embraced them,"" said University of Florida political science professor Michael McDonald , who tracks voter turnout and early voting. ""That's resulted in a greater share of early votes being cast each election cycle.""For most of that time, advance voting was a nonpartisan feature of elections, but a deep chasm formed between the parties on advance voting during and since the 2020 presidential election.Voting before Election Day is much more common today than it was roughly 50 years ago. Yet it is highly politicized as voting in the 2024 presidential election is already underway.Advance voting refers to the range of options that people have to vote before Election Day, whether by mail or in person at an election facility.The term ""early voting"" can refer collectively to all voting that takes place before Election Day. Sometimes it refers explicitly to votes cast in person at local election offices or voting centers before Election Day.To avoid confusion, The Associated Press generally uses terms like ""advance voting"" or ""pre-Election Day voting"" to refer to that broader category and ""early in-person voting"" for the narrower one. ""Absentee voting"" usually refers to ballots cast by mail.Voting before Election Day includes both voting by mail and in-person voting conducted before Election Day.Early in-person voting tends to mimic the experience of voting in person on Election Day, down to the type of voting equipment used and the locations serving as voting centers. The main difference is that the voting is conducted before Election Day. The length of early in-person voting periods varies by state.Mail voting can be further divided into at least two smaller categories: ""no-excuse absentee voting,"" where any voter may request a mail ballot for any reason, and ""excuse-required absentee voting,"" where only voters with a valid excuse as to why they cannot vote in person on Election Day may vote by mail.Requiring an excuse to vote absentee, such as travel or illness, used to be the norm in most states. Today, a shrinking handful of states still require voters to provide an authorized excuse.A third category of mail voting is a hybrid of mail voting and early in-person voting: in-person absentee voting, where a voter submits (and sometimes fills out) a mail ballot in person at an elections office.A small but growing number of states conduct their elections predominantly by mail. Those states, plus a few others and the District of Columbia, automatically send every registered voter a ballot.Variations of absentee voting and voting over multiple days have been part of American elections since the nation's founding. Today's system of mail voting and early in-person voting took root more than a century ago. In 1921, Louisiana paved the way for a formalized early in-person voting system when its constitution specified that ""the Legislature may provide a method by which absentee voting will be permitted other than by mail.""Voting by mail is even older, but relatively few voters were allowed to take advantage of it as of 1972. Just two years later, Washington became the first state in the nation to allow any voter to request a mail ballot for any reason.By 2005, more than half the states adopted no-excuse absentee voting. Today, only Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire provide neither early in-person voting nor no-excuse absentee voting.Yes, but it wasn't always that way.Voting before Election Day steadily grew more popular in both Democratic and Republican-controlled states after 1972. Although there was a partisan split in some states that sometimes varied from election to election, polling from Gallup shows that nationwide there was little partisan divide on advance voting between 2004 and 2016. But the survey showed that voters' plans to use early voting sharply diverged along party lines in the 2020 presidential election.AP's VoteCast survey of the 2020 electorate found a similar result, with additional details on how the choice of voting method divided the electorate. About two-thirds of the votes cast by mail in that election were for Democrat Joe Biden , compared with about one-third for Republican President Donald Trump . In contrast, Trump won about two-thirds of the in-person Election Day vote, compared with about one-third for Biden.When it came to early in-person voting, there was a near-even split, with Trump having only the slightest advantage.Biden overperformed among those casting votes before Election Day, especially among mail-in voters, even in many states that Trump won by a wide margin, VoteCast showed.""This is just an across-the-board, national phenomenon,"" McDonald said.These patterns continued in the 2022 midterm elections, with Democrats accounting for the bulk of the mail vote, Republicans casting most of the Election Day vote and Republicans holding a small advantage in early in-person voting.McDonald noted that party behavior on pre-Election Day voting was, if anything, the opposite before 2020.""People who voted by mail tended to be more Republican than the people who voted in-person early,"" he said, but those patterns ""were suddenly turned upside down"" during the pandemic.During the 2020 election, Trump repeatedly disparaged, politicized and undermined mail voting, going as far as to block funding to the US Postal Service to thwart its ability to process mail ballots he claimed without evidence were susceptible to widespread tampering.Trump's messaging on mail balloting has been somewhat inconsistent. At times he has said ""absentee voting"" is "" good. "" But he also has claimed that mail voting is ripe for fraud, something not borne out by decades of mail voting conducted in every state. Trump himself has cast mail ballots on multiple occasions, including in the 2020 primaries.Trump's rhetoric seems to have taken a toll on Republican confidence in mail voting. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in 2023 found that 58% of Republicans were not very or not at all confident that mail votes would be counted accurately, compared with 32% in 2018. Among Democrats, confidence in the counting of mail ballots increased, from 28% saying they were very or extremely confident in 2018 to 52% in 2023.""We need to wait and see how 2024 plays out before we make definitive statements about what the early voting is telling us"" about the election, McDonald said.Absentee voting in some states began as early as mid-September, and more than half the states had begun some type of voting by October 1.","Voting before Election Day is much more common today than it was roughly 50 years ago. Voting in the 2024 presidential election is already underway. For most of that time, advance voting was a nonpartisan feature of elections.

Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday launched a scathing attack on her opponent former President Donald Trump linked him to the far right play-book.During an interview with CBS Evening News, the Democratic hopeful said that Trumps name appears at least 300 times in Project 2025 and his running mate JD Vance has written the foreword to the book of the author of Project 2025""As you know, I am a former prosecutor.

Despite this, Trump has publicly distanced himself from the initiative, labeling some of its ideas as “seriously extreme.”The proposals in Project 2025, which include right-wing policies and a radical reshaping of the executive branch, have been frequently criticized by Democrats . A Harris campaign official stated that the campaign has deliberately associated all of Trump’s policies with “Project 2025,” believing this branding resonates with voters, reported CNN.Though the Project 2025 report was released in April 2023, opposition to the document has intensified as Trump’s polling lead has grown. In response to the increased scrutiny, Trump has distanced himself from the proposal, stating on his social media platform, Truth Social, “I know nothing about Project 2025. I have no idea who is behind it.” He further characterized some of the project’s ideas as “absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.”","Project 2025 is a 920-page document developed by the Heritage Foundation outlining potential policies and changes for a hypothetical second term of Donald Trump’s presidency.

John Kelly’s suggestion that his onetime boss fits “into the general definition of fascist.”In a recent episode of ""State of the Union,"" host Jake Tapper confronted Vance on the former president's statements about pursuing election officials accused of fraud.“You’re taking words out of context,” Vance responded to the allegations.“If you’d like to put up a clip and actually put him in context, I think the American people would realize that Donald Trump is a hell of a lot more reasonable than the people like Liz Cheney , who would like to lie us into war,"" he added.“Now, Jake, we also should remember, I mean, step back a little bit. Ask yourself a basic question about network integrity. You guys talked about the Russia hoax nonstop,"" Vance further said.Vance further accused CNN of giving credence to unnamed FBI agents and anonymous sources, arguing that viewers would have believed in a conspiracy between Trump and Vladimir Putin, which he called ""totally and preposterously false.""Tapper defended the network, insisting that they were merely covering an ongoing FBI investigation.The conversation then shifted to comments made by former Trump administration officials, including former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley.Kelly had told The New York Times that Trump ""certainly prefers the dictator approach to government"" and claimed that Trump expressed admiration for the loyalty of Adolf Hitler's generals, which Trump has denied. Milley, according to Bob Woodward's recent book ""War,"" described Trump as a ""fascist to the core.""Vance launched a scathing attack on Kelly and accused him of having a ""world view that's so oppositional to peace."" When Tapper questioned whether all the former officials, including former Vice President Mike Pence, were going after Trump because they wanted to send people to war, Vance firmly agreed, stating that they had entered office believing they could control Trump when he expressed a desire for world peace.Trump himself has expressed regrets over some of his staffing choices, telling Joe Rogan that his biggest mistake was picking ""some people that I shouldn't have picked,"" describing them as ""neocons, or bad people, or disloyal people."" He also praised several hawkish Republicans in his orbit, such as former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.Following Vance's interview, CNN aired a rebuttal from Liz Cheney, who accused Vance of going through ""unbelievable contortions"" to defend Trump, whom Vance had previously called ""America's Hitler"" during the 2016 campaign. Vance has since attributed his past criticism of Trump to a warped understanding influenced by the media.",JD Vance slammed CNN host Jake Tapper for targeting former President Donald Trump over his remarks about an “enemy from within” Vance also attacked former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley for their comments.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114663025,imgsize-1457209,width-400,resizemode-4/114663025.jpg"

The iconic venue and personal prestige

Strategic media magnet

A defiant message in blue territory

Possible boost for local races

Trump’s enduring ties to New York

Former President Donald Trump's decision to hold a rally at Madison Square Garden—well outside the typical battleground states—is leaving political observers curious. With New York heavily leaning Democratic, why would Trump stage an event here with just days left in his campaign? Here’s a breakdown of the key reasons behind this unusual choice.For Trump, the venue’s prestige is as much a draw as the potential for voter reach. Madison Square Garden , billed as “the World’s Most Famous Arena,” has hosted countless celebrities and iconic events. Trump, long drawn to the fame and legacy of such venues, likely views this rally as a significant personal milestone, underscoring his background in entertainment. From his RNC appearances to his frequent mentions of crowd size and venue stature, the rally lets Trump position himself among the notable stars who’ve graced the Garden’s stage.With New York City a media hub, Trump’s rally is designed to maximize press coverage. Even if New York isn’t in play electorally, the event will attract widespread media attention and amplify his message across states where votes are more competitive. His team anticipates heavy coverage of this high-profile location to boost visibility in the final days, capturing attention that reaches far beyond Manhattan.Holding a rally in Democratic stronghold New York isn’t just strategy; it’s a statement. For a city where Trump faced multiple legal challenges, including civil and criminal cases, a high-profile event like this serves as a defiant gesture. It’s a calculated move to reinforce his “outsider” persona and resonate with supporters nationwide by appearing bold, even on less favorable turf.Though New York is a safe state for Democrats in the presidential race, several House races in Long Island and the Hudson Valley are hotly contested. Trump’s presence could rally Republican voters, influencing turnout for down-ballot candidates in critical areas where Republicans hope to retain control of the House. The rally might not sway New York's overall vote, but it could help GOP candidates in these competitive districts.Despite relocating his residency to Florida in 2019, New York remains a city Trump frequents, partly due to his legal cases and personal ties to Trump Tower. The rally reflects his lingering connection to his hometown, even if the state’s political climate makes winning unlikely.In short, Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden is both symbolic and strategic — a unique move in a city where his support is limited but visibility is high. With the race nearing its conclusion, the rally showcases Trump’s characteristic showmanship and his team’s effort to keep him in the spotlight, especially where media coverage and turnout may benefit the broader Republican campaign.","Former President Donald Trump's decision to hold a rally at Madison Square Garden is leaving political observers curious.
