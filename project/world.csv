MEERUT : A 21-year-old Dalit woman who was allegedly raped by an upper caste man in August 2023 was later forced to ""settle"" the matter at a panchayat and paid Rs 2.5 lakh to remain silent.But that was not the end of her ordeal. Just as her family moved to another place to flee the harassment and social barbs, and quietly arranged her marriage in a place far away, the accused got wind of it and sent a video of the sexual assault to her fiance, following which the wedding was called off.What came after that was worse. The accused's family demanded the money back. It was then that the survivor's father, unable to tolerate the pressure and threats any longer, met Hapur SP Kunwar Gyananjay Singh. An FIR was lodged on Thursday, almost two years after the crime.The woman's father said: ""After my daughter was violated, a panchayat was called where we were forced to settle the matter for Rs 2.5 lakh. We left the village for another place and I arranged my child's marriage to a man recently, but the accused sent an obscene video to her fiance. Her marriage was called off. What are we to do now?""The survivor's mother said she, too, was recently assaulted and disrobed by the family of the accused. ""They came to us demanding the money back and started misbehaving with us. When my wife opposed them, she was assaulted. The accused tore her clothes,"" the girl's father told police.""The initial incident was not reported to me. Now, a written complaint has been received, following which an FIR under IPC sections 376 (rape), 354 (assault or criminal force) and 506 (criminal intimidation) has been registered against five men,"" said Hafizpur SHO Ashish Kumar.""Teams have been formed to probe the matter, and arrests will be made,"" the SHO added.","A 21-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped by an upper caste man in August 2023.

Staffer detained, then let off

BENGALURU: Stung by the way the protocol wing at KIA was misused to allegedly aid gold-smuggling operations, the state govt has decided to revise the standard operating procedures, stating family members and friends of senior bureaucrats will not be entitled to use the services of protocol staff .Additional chief secretary (home) Umashankar SR said security protocol will be provided only to officials who are travelling and not their family members or relatives. The move comes after the arrest of actor Ranya Rao , who was caught smuggling gold allegedly misusing protocol privileges.There is no provision for extending security to anyone beyond the officer (IPS or IAS). Additional security is provided only in cases where an official faces threat... then security may be extended to the officer's immediate family,"" he said.State police protocol came under scanner after DRI detained Ranya Rao on charges of gold smuggling . Sources in DRI had detained the protocol staffer and decided to make him her accomplice in the case. However, the staffer was let off after he gave a statement specifying that he had been given instructions to receive the DGP's daughter on landing and that he had no clue as to what she was carrying.","Stung by the way the protocol wing at KIA was misused, the state govt has decided to revise the standard operating procedures.

Pakistan is grappling with a severe resurgence of terrorism with its homegrown Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) emerging as one of the deadliest terrorist organisations globally, as per the Global Terrorism Index 2025.According to the report, the four terrorist groups responsible for the most deaths globally in 2024 were Islamic State (IS), Jamaat Nusrat Al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM), Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and al-Shabaab.Deaths attributed to these groups increased by 11 per cent to 4,204 deaths in 2024, or 80 per cent of deaths that were attributed to a specific group. In 2014, these four groups were responsible for less than 40 per cent of terrorism deaths that were attributed to a group, highlighting the large global shifts in terrorism over the past decade.Islamic State (IS) and its affiliates remained the world's deadliest terrorist group in 2024, and is active in 23 countries, one more than in 2023. Deaths attributed to the group and its affiliates declined by ten per cent, from 1,996 to 1,805 deaths.Of the major terrorist organisations, TTP was responsible for the largest increase in deaths, which rose by 90 per cent to 558 deaths, said the report.The report noted that Pakistan recorded the second-largest increase in terrorism deaths in 2024, with the toll rising by 45 per cent to 1,081.Terrorism has increased significantly in Pakistan since the Taliban's rise to power in Afghanistan, with the number of attacks increasing fivefold since 2021.The most recent surge in terrorism in Pakistan was primarily driven by increased TTP activity, which is aligned with the Afghan Taliban. Deaths attributed to the group nearly doubled between 2023 and 2024.In 2024, the TTP was responsible for 558 deaths across 482 attacks, marking it as the third deadliest terrorist group globally. This resurgence follows a period of reduced activity between 2017 and 2021. The number of attacks attributed to the TTP reached a record high in 2024, with deaths at their highest level since 2011.The group's activity is largely concentrated along Pakistan’s northern border with Afghanistan, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where 96 percent of the TTP's attacks occurred.TTP activity in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa more than doubled in the past year, escalating from 182 attacks resulting in 265 deaths in 2023 to 462 attacks and 545 deaths in 2024. The deadliest attack in 2024 saw TTP militants killing 16 Pakistani soldiers at an army outpost, claimed as retaliation for the killing of senior TTP commanders.The TTP's primary targets align with its anti-state objectives, focusing on police and military personnel, who accounted for 51 percent and 16 percent of attacks, respectively.Civilians were also frequently targeted, comprising 16 percent of attacks and 19 percent of terrorism-related deaths.Armed attacks remain the TTP’s most common tactic, accounting for nearly two-thirds of attacks and 72 percent of deaths. Bombings have also increased, nearly tripling compared to the previous year.The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, also known as the Pakistani Taliban, was formed in 2007.Sharing a common ideology with the Afghan Taliban, the TTP aims to overthrow the Pakistani government through acts of terrorism against the armed forces and state members. The group operates primarily along the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan, comprising numerous smaller Islamist armed militant groups.Following the TTP's deadliest attack in December 2014, where 141 people, mostly children, were killed in a school, the Pakistani government launched the National Action Plan (NAP) to combat terrorism.In June 2024, Operation Azm-e-Istehkam was initiated to accelerate the NAP's implementation, involving airstrikes targeting militants and key insurgent leaders. However, these actions have been met with controversy, including claims of civilian casualties during strikes in Afghanistan’s Paktika province.Despite not holding direct territorial control, the TTP maintains significant influence in regions such as North and South Waziristan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The group leverages the mountainous terrain to facilitate movement and sustain operational mobility across the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.","Terrorism has increased significantly in Pakistan since the Taliban's rise to power in Afghanistan, with the number of attacks increasing fivefold since 2021.

NEW DELHI: In Uttarakhand, the outrage among the hill community over cabinet minister Premchand Aggarwal remarks in the assembly continues to grow, with some BJP MLAs and netas openly condemning Aggarwal's remarks.The latest to do so was Garhwal MP Anil Baluni who, speaking at Kotdwar in Pauri Garhwal district Friday, described Aggarwal's comment on hill communities as ""inappropriate"" and ""not only painful, but also unfortunate"".In his interaction with the media, Baluni said that as the party's chief spokesperson, he has limitations on what he can say publicly. Hinting at internal discussions, he revealed that he has already expressed his dissatisfaction within the party forum.He emphasised that he has a proper platform to address these issues and that he has fulfilled his duties and responsibilities toward the hill community within the party framework.Baluni holds a significant position in national politics of BJP and his statement makes it likely that major political upheavals could be expected in Uttarakhand in coming days.Aggarwal faced significant backlash following remarks made during a legislative assembly session.He suggested that Uttarakhand was not established exclusively for 'Pahadis' (hill people), a statement perceived by many as derogatory towards the hill communities.Aggarwal expressed regret, stating that his words had been misconstrued and that he had no intention of offending any community.","Premchand Aggarwal faced significant backlash following remarks made during a legislative assembly session.

Trump insists there was 'no clash' between Elon Musk and Marco Rubio over DOGE cuts

A high-stakes White House meeting erupted into a showdown between Elon Musk and Secretary of State Marco Rubio , exposing deep rifts within the Trump administration over the billionaire’s sweeping government overhaul .According to a report by the New York Times, the tensions had been simmering for weeks, but they exploded in the Cabinet Room, where President Trump presided over a heated exchange between Musk and top officials. Rubio, long frustrated by Musk’s aggressive cost-cutting measures , pushed back hard when Musk accused him of failing to downsize his department.“You have fired nobody,” Musk scoffed, pointing out that the State Department remained bloated. Rubio fired back, reminding Musk of the 1,500 State Department officials who had taken buyouts. The billionaire was unimpressed.As the argument escalated, Trump, who had been watching with folded arms, finally intervened, reported New York Times. “Marco’s doing a great job,” he said, signaling a shift. While Trump had championed Musk’s efficiency crusade, the president now emphasized the need for a more measured approach.Trump announced a recalibration: Cabinet secretaries would take charge, with Musk’s team merely advising. The move was the first significant sign that Trump was willing to place limits on Musk’s influence.The meeting’s impact was immediate. Cabinet officials, many of whom had privately complained about Musk’s aggressive tactics, saw it as a turning point. The shift signaled that Trump was listening to concerns, particularly regarding layoffs affecting key constituencies, including veterans.Yet Musk’s influence remains formidable. His financial backing of Trump’s campaign and his grip on social media have left officials wary of crossing him. After the meeting, Trump posted that future cuts would be made with a “scalpel, not a hatchet,” a clear rebuke of Musk’s scorched-earth strategy.Musk later called the meeting “productive,” but inside the room, his frustration was evident. The battle for control over the administration’s cost-cutting efforts is far from over. While Trump has drawn a line, Musk is unlikely to retreat quietly. The question now is whether this uneasy truce will hold—or if another Cabinet clash is just around the corner.President Donald Trump, however, denied reports of the clash in a press meeting. ""There was no clash. I was there. Elon gets along great with Marco and they both are doing a fantastic job,"" he said.","Tensions had been simmering for weeks, but they exploded in the Cabinet Room.

Mayor Kevin Davis and community leaders have voiced strong endorsement of hockey great Wayne Gretzky , citing his influence on the game and his hometown. They noted his efforts to inspire young players, advance the sport of hockey, and give back to charitable causes. The community remains supportive of Gretzky, citing his enduring legacy on and off the ice.Mayor Kevin Davis, and a number of other well-known community leaders, have made public statements in favor of local hockey legend Wayne Gretzky. The great player, affectionately known as The Great One, has been a source of hometown pride for years, and his influence on the game can still be seen across the globe.Davis and others stressed Gretzky's off-ice contribution to the game and to the community, in addition to highlighting his on-ice achievements as a player and inspiration to youngsters. They touted his leadership and commitment, the legacy he's created on the ice, as well as on it.As talk of Gretzky's legacy builds, much of the community has banded behind him, acknowledging his enduring legacy on the game and the generations of players he has influenced. Such overwhelming support from Davis and others highlights just how much Gretzky is to his hometown and the wider hockey community.“I judge people on what they’ve done for our community not by their associations and Wayne and the entire Gretzky family have done a great deal for the City of Brantford,” Davis said Friday. “His contributions to the community and to Canada began years ago and continue to this day. The Gretzky family has brought immense pride and greatness to Brantford,” Davis said.Gretzky has faced criticism for supporting US President Donald Trump by attending his inauguration and wearing a Make America Great Again hat. He also served as Team Canada's honorary captain at the Four Nations Face-off in February, wearing a suit instead of a Team Canada jersey, further fueling the controversy.Davis acknowledged local dissatisfaction with the Four Nations final and Gretzky's association with the U.S. president. “They’re entitled to their opinions just like everyone else,” Davis said. “But I don’t think their views are at all representative of the city. The overwhelming majority of residents don’t support that view and those of us who have been involved with the Gretzky family over the years appreciate and respect what they’ve done for the community.”Also Read: ""Another mediocre bottom 6 player”: NHL fans fume over Scott Laughton’s addition to the Toronto Maple Leafs","Mayor Kevin Davis and community leaders have voiced strong endorsement of hockey great Wayne Gretzky.

President Trump signs executive order establishing White House Task Force for 2026 FIFA World Cup

President Donald Trump on Friday brushed off concerns that ongoing trade tensions between the US, Mexico, and Canada could affect the 2026 FIFA World Cup . Instead, he claimed the disputes would make the tournament “more exciting.”“Tension is a good thing … it makes it much more exciting,” Trump told reporters at the White House, where he met with FIFA President Gianni Infantino to announce the creation of a World Cup task force .Trump signed an executive order establishing the White House task force, which he will chair, to handle security and logistical preparations. “We’re going to make sure everything runs smoothly,” he said.Infantino, said the 2026 World Cup, along with this summer’s FIFA Club World Cup in the United States, would generate 200,000 jobs and have a $40 billion economic impact. “And more than that, we will give joy and happiness to the entire world, and this is priceless, definitely,” he added. “So thank you, Mr President, for setting up this task force, because it is important that everyone that comes to America feels safe, feels welcome, and that's why it's important that the government puts together this White House Task Force.”Despite Trump’s optimism, his trade policies have strained relations with the US's World Cup co-hosts. He has repeatedly threatened tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods, unsettling markets. His past remarks about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican leaders have also added to tensions.The 2026 World Cup will be the biggest in history, with 48 teams playing 104 matches across three nations. The US will host 78 of those matches, while Mexico and Canada will host 13 each. The final is set for July 19 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.","President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a White House task force for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Expressing concern about the deteriorating law and order situation in Bangladesh, exacerbated further by the release of violent extremists who were sentenced for serious crimes, the Indian government reiterated Friday that it's the interim government's responsibility to protect Hindus and other minorities. The govt also said it supports a stable, peaceful, inclusive and progressive Bangladesh in which all issues are resolved through democratic means and by holding inclusive and participatory elections.It also urged Dhaka to probe the perpetrators of killings and arson without making any distinction.

The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation endorsed the Arab League's counter-proposal to US President Donald Trump 's plan to seize Gaza and displace its residents, on Friday, according to two ministers who spoke to news agency AFP.""The emergency ministerial meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation adopted the Egyptian plan , which has now become an Arab-Islamic plan ,"" Egyptian Foreign minister Badr Abdelatty said.""The next step is for the plan to become an international plan through adoption by the European Union and international parties such as Japan, Russia, China and others. This is what we will seek and we have contact with all parties, including the American party."" Abdelatty added.According to the Middle East Monitor, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation ( OIC ) had convened an emergency meeting at its Jeddah headquarters to address the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the calls for displacement, and the urgent need for Gaza's reconstruction.The Arab-backed proposal, led by Egypt, calls for Hamas to relinquish control to an interim administration until a reformed Palestinian Authority (PA) assumes governance. Unlike Trump's plan, the Egyptian framework would allow nearly 2 million Palestinians to remain in Gaza.Meanwhile, the Donald Trump-led administration has rejected a long-anticipated Gaza reconstruction plan proposed by Arab leaders, reiterating its own vision for the region.According to CNN, the White House maintains that US President Donald Trump supports a plan that involves expelling Palestinian residents and transforming Gaza into a ""riviera"" under US ownership. In a statement on Tuesday night, White House National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said, ""The current proposal does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance.""“I think that it’s a big mistake to allow people, the Palestinians, or the people living in Gaza, to go back yet another time, and we don’t want Hamas going back. And think of it as a big real estate site and the United States is going to own it and we’ll slowly, very slowly, we’re in no rush, develop it. We’re going to bring stability to the Middle East soon,” Trump had told reporters in the first week of February.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, after meeting with Trump last month, had praised the proposal as a ""revolutionary, creative vision,"" claiming it had the potential to reshape the region's future. ""For an entire year, we've been told that in the 'day after,' the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) and the Palestinian Authority must be in Gaza,"" Netanyahu told his cabinet.","The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation endorsed the Arab League's counter- proposal to US President Donald Trump's plan to seize Gaza.

Ukraine’s security dilemma amid growing Russian aggression

After the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Ukraine was left with one of the world's largest nuclear stockpiles. The third-largest nuclear power, it inherited around 5,000 nuclear weapons, including intercontinental missiles that could deliver thermonuclear warheads. After having this powerful arsenal, Ukraine took the unprecedented step of relinquishing its nuclear weapons according to the ET reports. This decision, as it determined the fate of the nation, would go on to set the stage for future conflict with Russia.The denuclearization decision of Ukraine was made on the basis of myriad considerations. Although the nation had physically possessed the weapons, it hadn't possessed the control to utilize them. Russia, possessing the launch codes and control systems, possessed control over the weapons. It rendered Ukraine's nuclear arsenal meaningless as a deterrent since they couldn't utilize them by themselves.In addition, having such a large nuclear arsenal was financially unsustainable for the newly independent state of Ukraine, which was only just stabilizing its economy. The financial burden of keeping, securing, and possibly controlling operation of the weapons was too great, and to attempt to do so would have been likely to precipitate a diplomatic crisis with Russia and the West. Geopolitical risks and economic costs dissuaded Ukraine from giving up its nuclear arsenal.In response to international pressure to proliferate nuclear weapons, in 1991 the United States launched the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program, funding and technical assistance to enable former Soviet republics to dismantle nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. International pressure to dismantle nuclear stockpiles in former Soviet republics, including Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, resulted in the creation of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program in 1991.Ukraine, despite all this, in 1994 signed the Budapest Memorandum, a significant treaty, in which the United Kingdom, Russia, and the United States guaranteed Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in return for its giving up nuclear weapons. The treaty also guaranteed that these countries would not threaten or use military action against Ukraine and would call for UN action in the case of Ukraine being threatened at any time.Whereas initially the Budapest Memorandum was welcomed as a monumental step toward global nuclear disarmament, assurances laid out in the agreement began to lose legitimacy with shifts in political loyalties. Academics had long advised, nonetheless, that the preservation of nuclear weapons by Ukraine was required to protect from probable Russian attack, since Ukraine being geopolitically situated half-way between Russia and Europe. These concerns increasingly caught momentum since Vladimir Putin's return to the presidency.Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its backing of the separatists in eastern Ukraine dispelled any illusions about the validity of the Budapest Memorandum. While the memorandum was supposed to provide guarantees, Russia's move proved that commitments by nuclear powers can be unilaterally renounced with impunity. Steven Pifer, a former US ambassador to Ukraine, said there was a two-way failure by Washington and Kyiv to anticipate the ambitions of a rising Russia.The annexation of Crimea and the war in Eastern Ukraine revealed Ukraine's weakness after it had given up its nuclear status. Russia's action proved that international security guarantees, especially those offered by nuclear powers, were not reliable in the presence of aggressive actions by a great power.With the growing Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the world observed how Ukraine's sovereignty was targeted head-on by a nuclear nation. Ukraine's countermove came in the form of requesting and accepting Western military aid. It was about high-end weapons and intel sharing, but it left more questions on larger Ukrainian security concerns. The Budapest Memorandum that had provided for protection earlier hadn't managed to deter the violence it was intended to prevent.The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict illustrates the vulnerabilities of Ukrainian security in an order of the world where nuclear forces are not dependable guarantors of peace. The conflict has caused immense suffering and devastation on the human dimension, posing severe questions about Ukrainian territorial integrity and whether international assurances of security could reasonably deter future aggression.","After the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Ukraine was left with one of the world's largest nuclear stockpiles.

The organisation was termed as a ""terrorist organisation"" by India for trying to ""establish Islamic state and caliphate globally"".The ""March for Khilafat"" was joined by the thousands and the rally began from the north gate of Baitul Mukarram National Mosque in the capital city. The clashes erupted when the police intervened to stop the march, Dhaka Tribune reported.The procession initially proceeded without disruption, but tensions flared as demonstrators moved from Paltan towards Bijoynagar, where police set up a blockade. In response, Hizb ut-Tahrir members resisted, triggering a chase between both sides.To disperse the crowd, police fired tear gas shells and sound grenades, temporarily scattering the demonstrators. However, they later regrouped and attempted to resume their procession. As tensions escalated, law enforcement once again deployed tear gas, while protesters retaliated by hurling bricks and stones at officers. The confrontation intensified, resulting in the arrest of several Hizb ut-Tahrir members, Dhaka Tribune reported.The group remains a banned organization in Bangladesh, with all its activities and demonstrations declared illegal.The march comes amid rising concerns of violence against minorities and recent attacks on cultural, religious, and diplomatic properties in the south Asian nation, as raised by India at several occasions, especially after the ouster of former Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina last year.This was reiterated by a UN report released in January which revealed that members of Bangladesh's Hindu, Ahmadiyya Muslim, and indigenous communities faced human rights abuses during the anti-discrimination protests that led to the fall of Sheikh Hasina's government in 204 and its aftermath.It said that even though authorities had reportedly made 100 arrests in connection with the attacks, many perpetrators of revenge violence and targeted assaults continued to enjoy impunity.India declared Hizb ut-Tahrir a terrorist organisation last year and said that the group was ""involved in various acts of terror, including radicalising the gullible youths to join terrorist organisations and raise funds for terror activities, posing a serious threat to the national security and sovereignty of India. The Modi government is committed to securing Bharat by dealing the forces of terror with an iron fist.”“HuT is an organisation which aims to establish Islamic state and caliphate globally, including in India, by overthrowing democratically elected governments through jihad and terrorist activities by involving citizens of the country, which is a grave threat to the democratic setup and internal security of the country,” the ministry of home affairs had said.","Hizb ut-Tahrir held its first open rally in Dhaka on Friday against Bangladeshi administration's orders.

Trump’s warning on campus protests

Columbia under federal scrutiny

The Trump administration on Friday announced the immediate cancellation of approximately $400 million in federal grants to Columbia University, citing the institution’s alleged failure to prevent harassment of Jewish students amid ongoing campus protests against Israel’s actions in Gaza.In a joint statement, four government agencies said the decision was made in response to ""the school's continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students."" The cuts mark the first step in what officials warned could be broader action against the university, which currently receives around $5 billion in federal funding.Earlier this week, Trump vowed to withdraw federal funding from institutions that permit what he called “illegal protests.”In a post on Truth Social, he wrote, “All Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests.” He also threatened harsh consequences for those involved, stating, “Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students will be permanently expelled or, depending on ...the crime, arrested.”The decision to defund Columbia follows months of campus unrest, with protests intensifying after the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel. Demonstrations at Columbia and other universities have sparked accusations of anti-Semitism, particularly as clashes between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel students have led to disruptions and, at times, violence.Education Secretary Linda McMahon defended the administration’s move, stating that Jewish students have faced “relentless violence, intimidation, and anti-Semitic harassment” since October 7. “Universities must comply with all federal anti-discrimination laws if they are going to receive federal funding,” she said. “For too long, Columbia has abandoned that obligation to Jewish students. Today, we demonstrate to Columbia and other universities that we will not tolerate their appalling inaction any longer.”Columbia University has yet to respond to the funding cuts.Meanwhile, the Department of Justice last month launched a multi-agency task force to address anti-Semitism, with its first priority being to investigate and combat harassment on college campuses.","The cuts mark the first step in what officials warned could be broader action against the university.

The JD Vance meme has reached its peak. Across social media, grotesque, exaggerated images of the US Vice President flood group chats and Discord servers. His face swells, his eyes widen into a vacant, menacing stare, and his chin stretches in unnatural ways. Sometimes, he clutches a giant lollipop. Other times, he mutates into a McNugget, a nuclear explosion, or a decaying Darth Vader. And often, he simply says, “pwease.”Vance’s transformation into an internet spectacle is both a reflection of his public image and a continuation of a long tradition—Vice Presidents as figures of ridicule.Dan Quayle never escaped his infamous “potatoe” misspelling, Al Gore was mocked for his stiffness, and Kamala Harris faced relentless viral clips exaggerating her laughter. But Vance’s meme-ification feels different, more extreme, more surreal.His digital form has evolved. Early memes fixated on his smoky eyes and round cheeks, but the dominant version now is something monstrous. He has become a kind of Cabbage Patch Doll left in the sun, an uncanny, bloated figure that transcends political lines. The bizarre nature of the meme has found traction among conservatives, liberals, and even extremist corners of the internet.The phenomenon echoes the internet’s obsession with Pepe the Frog in 2016. Pepe, once a harmless comic character, morphed into a symbol hijacked by the far right. His “final form,” the Groyper, became an icon for white nationalist figures like Nick Fuentes. Vance’s meme transformation carries some of the same chaotic, shape-shifting energy—an amorphous, ever-expanding in-joke with no clear political allegiance, just a deep undercurrent of derision.Vance, who has long been a target of online ridicule, is no stranger to internet-driven humiliation. His memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, was once the subject of a parody so convincing that mainstream outlets reported a false rumor about him and a couch. The memes now tap into that same instinct: a deep, collective urge to turn Vance into a grotesque caricature, as if mocking him exposes something deeper about his nature.Vance himself has acknowledged the memes, telling The Blaze that he finds them funny. But in the endless cycle of internet culture, his amusement might not last long. Because whether he likes it or not, JD Vance has become something more than just a politician—he’s now a spectacle, a symbol, a meme whose bloated form may never fully deflate.","The JD Vance meme has reached its peak.

ISLAMABAD: Anguished cries of mourners preparing to bury their dead pierced an uneasy calm in Bannu cantonment of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Wednesday, a day after 13 civilians and five soldiers were killed in a burst of mayhem caused by militants ramming two explosives-laden vehicles into a wall of the army compound.Seven of the civilian casualties in the violence late Tuesday were children while five were women. Jaish al-Fursan, a militant group linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack and declared that dozens of soldiers were killed.The army said its prompt response to the militant incursion into the cantonment city helped thwart what could have been a suicide attack with far more devastating consequences. All 16 militants involved in the raid were killed, taking the casualties to 34, the military's media wing said.Schools and shops in Bannu city didn't open the morning after and remained shut throughout the day, reflecting that gloom that descended in the area, adjacent to the restive North Waziristan tribal district bordering Afghanistan. This was the second militant attack on the cantonment within a year and the third within Pakistan since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan last Sunday.In a statement shared on social media, Jaish al-Fursan said the blasts were triggered through explosives-laden vehicles.Official sources said the militant raiders blew up the vehicles at the gate after they were intercepted by security personnel stationed at the entrance. The attack started at 6.30pm, minutes after iftar (break in fasting), and was followed by an unspecified number of militants trying to infiltrate the camp. This resulted in a gunfight that continued till the last of the militants were killed.Over a dozen people were buried in the debris of walls and roofs of multiple houses destroyed by the explosions. A mosque next to the cantonment's entrance also collapsed, trapping a number of worshippers in the rubble. They were pulled out of the debris after the fighting ended.A few days earlier, a suicide bomber killed six people at an Islamic religious school in Akora Khattak town of the same province. Several Taliban leaders graduated from this school, infamous as the ""university of jihad"".Last year was the deadliest in a decade for Pakistan, with a surge in attacks in which over 1,600 lives were lost, according to official data.Islamabad accuses Kabul of failing to root out fighters sheltering on its soil and preparing to mount assaults on Pakistan, a charge the Taliban govt stoutly denies.Jaish al-Fursan is headed by Hafiz Gul Bahadur, a commander of what used to be regarded as the ""good Taliban"".","Jaish al-Fursan, a militant group linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack.

ISLAMABAD: US President Donald Trump's announcement to Congress late Tuesday about the capture of most-wanted terrorist Mohammad Sharifulla – mastermind of the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing outside Kabul airport that killed 13 American military service personnel and 170-odd Afghans – came with a surprise pat on Pakistan's back for its role in the operation.""Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice,"" Trump said in his first address to Congress since returning to the White House for a second term.""I want to thank especially the govt of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster,"" he said of the prolonged search culminating in forces tracing Sharifulla to a hideout on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.According to US media reports, CIA and Pakistani intelligence worked closely to find Sharifulla, whom Pakistan described as a ""top-tier operational commander"" of the proscribed Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-KP). The terrorist outfit had claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing that followed the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan that year.Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif was quick to highlight what his govt sees as an opportunity to regain the US's faith as a strategic partner following years of friction, notably after America's exit from Afghanistan and Washington’s growing closeness with India.Within the country, it gives the Sharif govt an advantage over former PM Imran Khan's Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), whose Pakistani-American supporters in the US had campaigned for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. They would possibly be disappointed by Trump's speech to Congress, which included no reference to Imran, PTI or Pakistan's democratic process.Sharif separately announced Sharifullah's arrest through a post on X. ""We thank US President Donald Trump for acknowledging and appreciating Pakistan's role and support in counter terrorism efforts across the region,"" he wrote.""As is well-known, Pakistan has always played a critical role in counter terrorism efforts aimed at denying safe havens to terrorists and militant groups the space to operate against any other country.""In neighbouring India, the reference to ""any other country"" could well spark a debate for a different reason.",US President Donald Trump announced the capture of most-wanted terrorist Mohammad Sharifulla.

A Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan’s assistance in the arrest stemmed from “excellent cooperation” between Islamabad and Trump’s new administration. This marks a shift from recent years, where US-Pakistan security collaboration had diminished following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan. Regional security concerns: The Islamic State Khorasan, IS’s regional affiliate, has been linked to several high-profile international attacks, including the March 2024 Moscow concert hall bombing that killed over 140 people and the deadly attack in Iran last year. The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations.

The Islamic State Khorasan, IS’s regional affiliate, has been linked to several high-profile international attacks, including the March 2024 Moscow concert hall bombing that killed over 140 people and the deadly attack in Iran last year. The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations. Pakistan’s domestic threats: IS-K has expanded its reach beyond Afghanistan, increasingly targeting Pakistani cities and security forces. Meanwhile, the TTP has launched numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan’s tribal regions. The government has struggled to contain these threats, making counterterrorism cooperation with the US a strategic necessity.

Between the lines



What’s next



US-Pakistan relations: If this counterterrorism cooperation continues, it could lead to a thaw in relations between the two countries, potentially reviving security assistance programs that had been cut in recent years. The US may also push Pakistan to do more against militant safe havens within its borders.

If this counterterrorism cooperation continues, it could lead to a thaw in relations between the two countries, potentially reviving security assistance programs that had been cut in recent years.

Impact on Pakistan’s security landscape: The arrest of Sharifullah may disrupt IS-K’s operational capabilities in the short term, but the group remains a potent threat. Pakistan will need to step up intelligence-sharing and military operations to prevent retaliatory attacks from IS-K and TTP.

The arrest of Sharifullah may disrupt IS-K’s operational capabilities in the short term, but the group remains a potent threat. Pakistan will need to step up intelligence-sharing and military operations to prevent retaliatory attacks from IS-K and TTP. Broader implications for Afghanistan: This arrest further highlights Afghanistan’s growing role as a sanctuary for international terrorist networks. The Taliban’s ability (or unwillingness) to suppress IS-K will be a key issue for regional stability.

Pakistani security forces played a crucial role in capturing Mohammad Sharifullah , a top commander of the Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K), who was allegedly responsible for the devastating suicide bombing outside Kabul airport in August 2021. The attack, which occurred during the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan, killed 13 US service members and 170 Afghan civilians.President Donald Trump, in his first address to Congress since his return to the White House, announced that Pakistan had helped arrest “the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity.” While he did not provide details about the operation, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later confirmed that Sharifullah was apprehended in a counterterrorism raid along the Pakistan-Afghan border.Pakistan’s involvement in this high-profile counterterrorism operation could significantly reshape its relationship with the US.By assisting in Sharifullah’s arrest, Pakistan is signaling its willingness to re-engage with Washington on security matters.This move comes as Pakistan faces increasing pressure from militant groups, including IS-K and the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which have intensified attacks within the country.The operation could help Islamabad gain favor with the US, potentially unlocking military and economic assistance at a time when Pakistan is grappling with financial instability.Pakistan’s decision to assist in Sharifullah’s arrest is not just about counterterrorism—it is also about geopolitics. The country’s strategic importance has waned since the US and Nato withdrawal from Afghanistan, but this operation could help Islamabad regain relevance in Washington’s security calculus.South Asia expert Michael Kugelman noted that Pakistan is trying to “leverage US concerns about terror in Afghanistan and pitch a renewed security partnership.”At the same time, Pakistan’s cooperation might be seen as a balancing act. Islamabad has maintained complex ties with the Afghan Taliban, and it remains to be seen how Kabul will react to this development.The US justice department has charged Sharifullah with ""providing and conspiring to provide material support and resources"" to the group.""He confessed. This was the planner of that bombing,"" White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said in an interview with Fox News.FBI director Kash Patel said Sharifullah was in US custody, in a post on X alongside a picture of agents standing in front of the plane that he was due to arrive on.""That time you delivered the sword of justice for the American people- thank you for your incredible leadership @AGPamBondi and @JohnRatcliffe. So proud of the men and women of the FBI, DOJ, and CIA.

ISLAMABAD: At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque of an Islamic religious school known as the “university of jihad” in Nowshera district of Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province on Friday.Among the dead were Maulana Hamid-ul-Haq Haqqani , head of Dar-ul-Uloom Haqqania school, the seminary in Nowshera’s Akora Khattak town where key Afghan Taliban leaders have studied. Mullah Omer, the slain founder of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, was also an alumni of this religious school.Graduates of the seminary include current Afghan Taliban leaders Amir Khan Muttaqi, Sirajuddin Haqqani, Abdul Latif Mansoor, Maulvi Ahmad Jan, Mullah Jalaludin Haqani, Maulvi Qalamudin, Arifullah Arif and Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa.The explosion occurred in the main prayer hall as people gathered for weekly Friday prayers were leaving the mosque.KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed confirmed that it was a suicide attack and that three policemen were also injured. “More than a dozen police officers were guarding the mosque when the attack occurred, and Haq’s seminary also had its own security,” he said.“It appears that Hamid Haqqani (seminary’s slain chief) was the target,” Hameed added.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, which came on the last Friday ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Yawar Zia, a police constable, who was injured in the attack, said he was on security duty at the seminary when the blast happened and splinters hit him. “After offering prayer, Hamid-ul-Haq, accompanied by his guards, was leaving the mosque when the powerful explosion occurred,” the wounded official said.Eyewitnesses described a chaotic scene, with blood and body parts scattered all over the place. They said the casualties could have been much higher had the bomber struck during the prayers.Haqqani, the son of slain prominent Pakistani cleric Sami-ul-Haq Haqqani, known as the “father of Taliban, was a vice-chancellor of the sprawling seminary, located 60 km from the provincial capital of Peshawar. Following his father’s assassination in 2018, he also became chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Sami (JUI-S) political party. He had also previously served as a member of the National Assembly from 2002 to 2007.Haq was also among the few who called on the world and Pakistan to immediately recognise the Taliban govt and establish diplomatic relations with Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul in 2021.Last year, he led a delegation of religious scholars to Afghanistan for “religious diplomacy” meetings with Taliban leaders.His seminary had faced controversy in the past as its students were accused of involvement in the assassination of Pakistan’s former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. The madrasa, however, denied any connection with the suspects.","At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque.

China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong , marking the first time a foreign national will be aboard the facility.The deal was signed in a ceremony held in Islamabad on Friday, between the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) and Pakistan’s Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO). Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was alos present during the ceremony.According to a statement by CMSA, both nations will collaborate on selecting and training Pakistani astronauts, with the chosen candidate expected to join Chinese taikonauts for a short-term mission in the coming years.""This signifies a major step in China’s international space cooperation ,"" reported Global Times, highlighting the growing partnership between Beijing and Islamabad in aerospace advancements.China’s space station, which has been operational for nearly four years, was built after the country was reportedly excluded from the International Space Station (ISS) due to concerns over the involvement of China’s military in its space programme.The station is also seen as a new frontier of competition between China and the US.As per the news agency PTI, the agreement further solidifies China’s support for Pakistan’s space ambitions, following previous collaborations such as the launch of Pakistani satellites.Pakistan’s first digital communications satellite, Badr-1, was launched aboard a Chinese Long March 2E rocket in 1990, while earlier this year, Pakistan’s CubeSat accompanied China’s Chang’e-6 probe to the Moon.According to Global Times, the selection of the astronaut is expected to take around a year, after which the candidate will undergo intensive training in China. This move, experts say, demonstrates the reliability of China's manned space technology and its willingness to lower barriers for developing countries to participate in space exploration .China has also set ambitious goals for space exploration, with plans to land astronauts on the Moon before 2030.Meanwhile, the US has its sights set on returning to the lunar surface by 2025.","China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong.

During a Business of the House session, the Chair of the Backbench Business Committee described the security breach on Wednesday evening as an affront to democracy and called on Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to make a statement in Parliament on the issue of safety of Indian visitors to the UK.It came soon after the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) had issued a statement strongly condemning the incident outside Chatham House in central London.""Yesterday, the External Affairs Minister from India, Shri Jaishankar, was attacked when he was leaving a public venue where he had been addressing an audience of Indian people in this country,"" said Blackman.""He was attacked by Khalistani thugs. That is against the Geneva Convention, and it appears that the police and the security forces failed to ensure that he was made safe. That is an affront to democracy, and an affront to our friends and allies in India,"" he said.""We need to make sure that does not happen again. Will the Leader of the House ensure that the Home Secretary or an appropriate minister makes a statement to the House about what protection we will have to ensure that visitors to this country are safe?"" he questioned.Lucy Powell, the Labour government's Leader of the House of Commons, expressed her shock at the incident and assured Blackman of a ""full response"" from the Home Secretary.""I am very sorry to hear about what sounded like a serious attack on a visitor to this country from the Indian Parliament.

It later also summoned UK Charge D' Affaires Christina Scott to register its serious concerns.The FCDO, meanwhile, said, ""any attempts to intimidate, threaten, or disrupt public events are completely unacceptable.""""The Metropolitan Police acted swiftly to address the situation, and we remain fully committed to ensuring the security of all our diplomatic visitors, in line with our international obligations,"" a spokesperson said.The Met Police stressed that the protester who ran in front of the minister's stationary car waving a flag was ""quickly intercepted by officers and moved out of the way"".""He did not get close to the minister who was able to leave the area without further incident. There were no arrests,"" a police spokesperson said.Jaishankar, who is on a tour of the UK and Ireland this week, is to hold bilateral talks with his Irish counterpart, Simon Harris, in Dublin on Thursday.","Opposition Conservative Party lawmaker Bob Blackman raised the issue of the ""attack"" on External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in London by "" Khalistani thugs "" in the House of Commons.
