‘Is Trump dead?’: Rumors quashed as US president spotted golfing in Virginia with grandkids,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-trump-dead-rumors-quashed-as-us-president-spotted-golfing-in-virginia-with-grandkids-see-pics/articleshow/123604017.cms,"The internet frenzy

Health speculation lingers

Still firing on Truth Social





The internet’s strangest political rumor of the week, that Donald Trump had secretly died, was put to rest on Saturday when the President was photographed teeing off at his Virginia golf club.Dressed in a white polo, black slacks, and his trademark red MAGA cap, Trump appeared relaxed as he left the White House with his grandchildren before heading to the links. The White House press pool confirmed his departure in the presidential motorcade at 8:49 am, providing definitive proof that the 47th President is alive and well.For much of Saturday, Trump was the top trending search on Google and across social media platforms, with phrases like “Is Trump dead?” and “Trump is dead” flooding timelines. The rumors, though baseless, spread rapidly, fueled in part by his recent absence from the public eye and lingering speculation about his health.Trump’s last major appearance was on August 26, when he chaired a televised cabinet meeting. Before that, he was spotted on August 24 golfing in Virginia alongside former MLB pitcher Roger Clemens.Concerns about Trump’s health have persisted for weeks after photos surfaced of him with a large bruise on his right hand and visible swelling around his ankles.The White House did not address the images directly but last month released a letter confirming Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a condition linked to age and prolonged standing. Doctors have suggested the ankle swelling may be connected to routine aspirin use.Adding fuel to the rumor mill, Vice President JD Vance recently told USA Today that he was “ready to step in” if a “terrible tragedy” struck, though he emphasized that Trump remained in “great health.”Despite skipping public events this weekend, Trump has remained active online. Hours before his golf outing, he posted on Truth Social lashing out at a US appeals court for striking down most of his tariffs, a reminder that, contrary to internet whispers, the President is still very much at the helm.","The internet’s strangest political rumor of the week, that Donald Trump had secretly died, was put to rest on Saturday when the President was photographed teeing off at his Virginia golf club.

Farmer In Village, Sewadar In Delhi: Singh Handled 2 Jobs To Help Family





NEW DELHI: A 35-year-old sewadar was on Friday brutally beaten to death with sticks by a group of men inside the premises of southeast Delhi's Kalkaji Temple following a dispute over the distribution of chunni prasad.Police have arrested five people so far, including the father of one of the men for harbouring him.The victim, Yogendra Singh , hailed from Fattepur in Uttar Pradesh's Hardoi district, where he used to work as a farmer.

He recalled how Yogendra worked relentlessly and without complaining driven by the single goal of securing a better future for his children. His daughter, who has problems performing basic tasks with her arm and leg, has been undergoing treatment for over a year, costing the family over Rs 1.5 lakh.Yogendra, the youngest of three brothers, last met his wife, mother and two children when he left home two months ago.

""I was going to Puri in Odisha for work and he asked me to travel safely and take care of myself. He was such a simple man, who never hurt anyone and only ever cared for others,"" he said.Eyewitnesses to the horrible attack on Yogendra at the temple described the scene as ""complete chaos"", with the attackers using sticks to brutally assault the victim while cursing at him.

The mob had iron rods and sticks in their hands and beat him to death."" Another 21-year-old sewadar, who was a close friend of Yogendra for over a decade, was filled with fear and anxiety: ""We get into minor arguments with devotees all the time but such issues can be resolved with conversation.

‘No power to impose’: US court declares most tariffs illegal; Trump says 'total disaster for country',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/no-power-to-impose-tariff-us-court-declares-most-trump-tariffs-illegal-judge-cites-overreach/articleshow/123592775.cms,"Donald Trump (File -AP)

India’s ‘Befitting Response’ To Trump’s 50% Tariffs; Sets Russian Oil 'Import Record' | Report





A US federal appeals court on Friday ruled that most tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump under emergency powers were illegal, striking at the heart of his trade policy and setting up a likely battle in the Supreme Court The ruling by the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington, DC, covered two sets of tariffs - Trump’s “reciprocal” duties imposed in April as part of his trade war and another set announced in February against China, Canada and Mexico. It does not affect other tariffs Trump imposed under separate statutes, including those on steel and aluminum imports.In a 7-4 judgement the court observed: “The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax,” as quoted by Reuters.The decision also said Trump had exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).Trump had invoked IEEPA, a 1977 law historically used for sanctions and asset freezes, to justify tariffs by declaring a national emergency over persistent US trade deficits and cross-border drug flows. The administration argued that the law’s power to “regulate” imports extended to tariffs.The appeals court rejected that view, saying: “It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs. The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President’s power to impose tariffs.”The appeals court put its ruling on hold until October 14, allowing the Trump administration time to seek a reversal from the Supreme Court.Minutes after the ruling, President Donald Trump sharply criticised the judgement, saying if allowed it would be a “ total disaster for the Country”.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, he attacked the appeals courts as ""Highly Partisan"" and asserted that the Supreme Court would rule in his favour.“If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country,” Trump wrote in his post. “If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America.”“The President’s tariffs remain in effect, and we look forward to ultimate victory on this matter,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a separate statement, as quoted by CNBC.Trump has relied heavily on tariffs in his second term, using them as a central tool of US foreign policy to pressure trading partners and push for revised trade agreements. While the duties have helped his administration secure economic concessions, they have also added to uncertainty in financial markets.The lawsuits were filed separately by five small US businesses and a coalition of 12 Democratic-led states, who argued that under the Constitution, the power to issue taxes and tariffs lies with Congress and any delegation of that authority must be both explicit and limited.Trump had defended the tariffs as a way to rebalance global trade and protect US industries. He said the April tariffs were necessary because the US had imported more than it exported for decades, undermining manufacturing and military readiness.He also said the February tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico were justified because those countries were not doing enough to curb the flow of illegal fentanyl into the US - an assertion those governments have denied.The New York-based US Court of international trade had earlier ruled against Trump’s tariff policies on May 28, saying the president had exceeded his powers when imposing both sets of challenged tariffs. That three-judge panel included one judge appointed by Trump during his first term. Another court in Washington also found that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs, with the government appealing that decision.According to Reuters, at least eight lawsuits have been filed against Trump’s tariff measures, including one brought by the state of California.While the latest decision restricts tariffs imposed under IEEPA, it leaves intact those imposed under other legal authorities. The Justice Department is expected to appeal, with the case likely headed to the US Supreme Court.","US federal appeals court rules that most tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump under emergency powers were illegal.

NEW DELHI: A man killed his wife and mother-in-law with a pair of scissors in northwest Delhi's KN Katju Marg area following a heated argument over a birthday gift for their son.The accused, Yogesh Sehgal, was later arrested in Rohini, where he was detected roaming around with his two sons.On Saturday, around 3.50 pm, police received a PCR call reporting the murder of the caller's mother, Kusum Sinha, 63, and sister, Priya Sehgal, 34, both residents of Rohini.Read also: ‘No gifts from your family’: How a birthday remark sparked Delhi double murder with scissors A police team rushed to the third floor house in Rohini Sector 17, where they found two female bodies lying in a pool of blood. The crime team and forensic experts were summoned to the scene.According to Sinha's son, Megh Sinha, his mother visited Priya's house on Aug 28 to celebrate the birthday of Priya's son, Chirag. Megh alleged that Yogesh killed his mother and sister and fled with the children. Sehgal was arrested and the cops seized his blood-stained clothes and a pair of scissors, the alleged weapon of offence.The murder is attributed to domestic disputes and frequent quarrels.""A dispute erupted between Priya and her unemployed husband, Yogesh, over gifts exchanged between the two families and Kusum stayed at Priya's residence to help resolve the issue,"" said Rajeev Ranjan, DCP (Rohini).When Megh couldn't reach his mother by phone on Saturday, he visited Priya's house and found the flat locked and spied bloodstains near the door. When they broke the lock, they discovered the bodies of Kusum and Priya inside.Megh told the media that when the house was in complete disarray, with belongings scattered all over. When he lifted his mother, he noticed deep injuries on her throat and abdomen, with blood flowing from the wounds. "" I called the police control room. I came to know that Yogesh had gone to the police station and accused Priya and his mother-in-law of beating him,"" Megh claimed.The accused was caught in Rohini with his two children. During interrogation, he revealed that the family was celebrating their youngest son's 15th birthday. He told the cops that his wife made an uncharitable comment about his family not bringing gifts, which triggered his anger. Around 11.30pm, he allegedly stabbed Priya in the neck with a pair of scissors and then attacked his mother-in-law.After committing the crime, Yogesh attempted to clean up the blood. He then locked the door and waited for his sons to return from school. When they arrived, he informed them about the murder and said he would take them somewhere before the police caught up with him. However, he was apprehended before he could execute his plan. According to the investigators, the couple's frequent arguments, coupled with the comment about gifts, seemed to have triggered the violence.","A man killed his wife and mother-in-law with a pair of scissors in northwest Delhi.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi landed in Tianjin Saturday evening for what is his first visit to China in 7 years, amid global trade disruptions and shifting alliances. The visit follows an almost year-long effort by both sides to narrow down their differences on the contentious border issue and normalise the relationship in the form of steps already taken like resumption of Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage for Indians and tourist visas for Chinese nationals.As has been reported earlier, Modi will have a bilateral meeting with President Xi Jinping on Sunday, the first of his many engagements over the next 2 days. However, among the highlights on the first day will also be a likely meeting with Myanmar’s acting president and military chief Min Aung Hlaing.“Landed in Tianjin, China. Looking forward to deliberations at the SCO Summit and meeting various world leaders,” said Modi in a post on X, after arriving in China.India has had limited high-level contacts with Myanmar since the military took control of state power in 2021 but this will be Modi’s second meeting with the Myanmar leader this year, after their talks on the margins of the BIMSTEC summit in Thailand. Ahead of a planned election in December, as announced by the military, Modi is likely to stress the importance of an early restoration of democracy in the country torn by ethnic violence through inclusive and credible polls and dialogue.Myanmar under its military has struggled to shed its pariah status in the West but continues to maintain strong ties with both China and India. For India, which has a 1600 km land border with Myanmar, it’s imperative to work with the military rulers to deal with the persistent challenge of border insurgency.While Modi is in China for the SCO summit, his most crucial engagement will likely be the meeting with Xi that is expected to cement the recent progress in ties after an almost 5-year-old military standoff. According to sources, the PM will approach the meeting with the intention to take the relationship forward with a long-term and strategic perspective. The meeting will take place at a time India’s relationship with the US is at its lowest ebb in decades. While both sides have not indicated signing of any big-ticket agreement, the leaders are expected to endorse efforts to resume direct air services between the 2 countries.There will be focus on trade and economic cooperation with Modi likely to underline the need for a fair trade partnership and seek a reaffirmation of the Chinese commitment to address India’s needs in critical areas like rare earths, fertilisers and equipment. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi recently assured his counterpart S Jaishankar Beijing will lift curbs on export of some of these items. Modi is also likely to raise the issue of cross-border terrorism in the context of the recent Pahalgam terrorist attack.","PM Narendra Modi landed in Tianjin Saturday evening for what is his first visit to China in 7 years, amid global trade disruptions and shifting alliances.

Donald Trump's immigration crackdown: Chicago mayor signs order blocking police role in raids; vows city won’t 'take orders',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trumps-immigration-crackdown-chicago-mayor-signs-order-blocking-police-role-in-raids-vows-city-wont-take-orders/articleshow/123609517.cms,"File photo: Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson and US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)





Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order directing city agencies and police to resist US President Donald Trump’s planned federal immigration enforcement surge, which could begin within days.The order, issued on Saturday, bars the Chicago Police Department from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement, patrols, traffic stops, checkpoints, or arrest operations.Johnson said the measure was necessary to “guard the constitutional rights of Chicago residents amidst the possibility of imminent militarised immigration or National Guard deployment by the federal government,” according to news agency AP.When asked whether he would follow instructions from federal agents, Johnson replied, “Yeah, and I don’t take orders from the federal government.”The order also requires Chicago police, including undercover officers, to wear uniforms and prohibits them from covering their faces, contrasting with federal immigration officers, many of whom now wear masks since Trump took office. At the same time, Johnson urged federal officers deployed in Chicago to identify themselves with names, badge numbers and body cameras, Politico reported.Two US officials cited by AP said the immigration crackdown could start as early as September 5 and last for 30 days. The officials said the operation was part of a wider Trump administration strategy to expand federal law enforcement in Democratic-led cities, similar to earlier actions in Los Angeles.At a news conference, Johnson accused Trump of using federal power for political retribution, calling him ‘reckless and out of control.’“He’s the biggest threat to our democracy that we’ve experienced in the history of our country”, he added.Trump, in a Truth Social post on Saturday, pointed to Chicago’s recent gun violence and attacked Illinois Governor JB Pritzker. “Six people were killed, and 24 people were shot, in Chicago last weekend, and JB Pritzker, the weak and pathetic Governor of Illinois, just said that he doesn’t need help in preventing CRIME. He is CRAZY!!! He better straighten it out, FAST, or we’re coming!”The White House described Johnson’s executive order as a “publicity stunt.” Spokeswoman Abigail Jackson was quoted as saying by CNN, “If these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticise the President, their communities would be much safer. Cracking down on crime should not be a partisan issue.”Illinois governor Pritzker also condemned Trump’s plan, accusing the administration of trying to “circumvent our democracy, militarise our cities and end elections,” CNN reported.Vice President JD Vance, however, defended the administration’s approach, saying during a visit to Wisconsin, “Chicago has had a lot of crime problems. Why is it that you have mayors and governors who are angrier about Donald Trump offering to help them than they are about the fact that their own residents are being carjacked and murdered in the streets?”","Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order directing city agencies and police to resist US President Donald Trump’s planned federal immigration enforcement surge.

India ‘Laughs’ As Trump SCREAMS ‘Disaster’ At US Court’s Ruling Against Tariffs | ‘No Power To...’

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump ""no longer has plans"" to visit India later this year for the Quad Summit, The New York Times reported on Saturday, detailing how ties between Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have ""unravelled"" in recent months.In a report titled The Nobel Prize and a Testy Phone Call: How the Trump-Modi Relationship Unravelled, the NYT, citing people familiar with Trump's schedule, said: ""After telling Mr Modi that he would travel to India later this year for the Quad summit, Mr Trump no longer has plans to visit in the fall.""There was no official comment from either government on the report.India is scheduled to host the Quad Summit later this year. Earlier in January, the Trump administration had hosted the Quad foreign ministers' meeting, a day after Trump took the oath of office for a second term.The article linked the souring ties to Trump's repeated assertions that he had resolved the four-day conflict in May between India and Pakistan -- claims denied by New Delhi.""President Trump's repeated claims about having 'solved' the India-Pakistan war infuriated Prime Minister Narendra Modi. And that was only the beginning,"" it said, adding that PM Modi was ""losing patience"" with Trump.On June 17, PM Modi and Trump spoke for 35 minutes as Trump returned to Washington from the G7 Summit in Canada, which PM Modi also attended.The two were due to meet on the sidelines of the summit in Kananaskis, but Trump left early, prompting PM Modi to speak to him over the phone before his departure.During that call, Trump invited PM Modi to stop over in Washington, but the request was declined as PM Modi had a scheduled visit to Croatia.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri later said in a video message from Kananaskis that PM Modi told Trump ""at no point during the days following Operation Sindoor was there any discussion, at any level, on an India-US trade deal, or any proposal for a mediation by the US between India and Pakistan.""Misri added that talks to end military action were initiated by Pakistan and handled directly through existing channels between the two armed forces.According to the NYT, during the June 17 call, Trump again claimed credit for ending the escalation and noted that Pakistan intended to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize . ""The not-so-subtle implication, according to people familiar with the call, was that Mr Modi should do the same,"" the paper reported.PM Modi, however, ""bristled. He told Mr Trump that US involvement had nothing to do with the recent ceasefire. It had been settled directly between India and Pakistan,"" the report said.""Trump largely brushed off Mr Modi’s comments, but the disagreement — and Mr Modi’s refusal to engage on the Nobel — has played an outsize role in the souring relationship between the two leaders, whose once-close ties go back to Mr Trump’s first term,"" it added.The White House did not acknowledge the call, and Trump made no mention of it online, though he has repeated his claim of halting the conflict ""over 40 times since May 10.""The NYT framed the episode as ""the tale of an American president with his eye on a Nobel Prize, running smack into the immovable third rail of Indian politics: the conflict with Pakistan.""The report also tied Trump's recent tariffs on India -- an additional 25% duty on Russian oil purchases -- to frustrations with Prime Minister Modi. It described the ""colossal penalties on India in particular” as “punishment for not falling in line rather than any kind of cohesive effort to reduce the trade deficit or cut off funding for"" Russia’s war.Richard Rossow, chair on India at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, was quoted as saying: ""If this was a real change in policy in trying to squeeze Russia, Trump could have put his weight behind legislation that would have imposed secondary sanctions on countries that buy Russian hydrocarbons. The fact that they have uniquely targeted India says this is about more than just Russia.""The NYT added that Trump, ""frustrated by the tariff negotiations,"" tried reaching out to PM Modi several times, but the Prime Minister Modi ""did not respond to those requests.""","US President Donald Trump ""no longer has plans"" to visit India later this year for the Quad Summit, NYT reports.

LoC shootout ends decades-long run of ‘human GPS’ terrorist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/loc-shootout-ends-decades-long-run-of-human-gps-terrorist/articleshow/123607511.cms,"SRINAGAR: Bagu Khan knew every trail, every ridge, every hidden path across the LoC. The terrorist guide dubbed “human GPS” was killed in a gunfight with security forces in north Kashmir’s Gurez sector on Aug 28, officials said Saturday.Security officials said Khan had facilitated nearly 100 infiltration attempts over decades, often slipping across the LoC himself. A resident of Bandipora in north Kashmir, he allegedly crossed into PoK in 1995 for arms training and first joined Hizbul Mujahideen. He later shifted between groups but earned his nickname for navigating treacherous mountain passes with uncanny precision.Khan was one of two terrorists gunned down during an alleged infiltration attempt in Naushera Nar of Bandipora. Soldiers spotted suspicious movement along the LoC and challenged the intruders. “They opened fire. Troops responded with counter-fire, neutralising two terrorists,” the Army said. The second slain man is believed to be a Pakistani.Officials said Khan’s death could deal a blow to infiltration networks along the LoC. His mastery of terrain made him indispensable for Pakistan-backed banned groups. “Loss of such an experienced guide can limit the ability of infiltrators to negotiate high-altitude routes and escape detection,” a source said.Official sources estimated 70 Pakistani terrorists are currently active in J&K, aided by guides like Khan to cross rugged terrain — deep gorges, dense forests, mountain caves, and natural hideouts offering ample cover. These highly trained intruders typically move in small groups of three to four, carry sophisticated weapons, including M4 carbines, and use iridium satellite phones and thermal imagery to coordinate and avoid detection. Their capability to exploit terrain and technology remains a serious challenge for security forces.This year, forces have killed 16 terrorists in Kashmir region, including three top Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives linked to the April 22 Pahalgam attack. The trio was shot dead in Srinagar on July 28.In a separate action Saturday, J&K police said they attached immovable property worth lakhs of rupees in Pulwama belonging to Gulzar Ahmad Dar, father of “designated terrorist” Arjumand Gulzar alias Hamza Bhai of banned outfit Al-Badr.Police warned civilians against aiding terrorists. “Police once again appeal to the general public not to provide shelter or support to terrorists, failing which they shall face strict legal action,” the statement read.","Bagu Khan was one of two terrorists gunned down during an alleged infiltration attempt.

'Less than 50 weapons to end conflict': IAF on Op Sindoor; details why Pak asked for ceasefire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/less-than-50-weapons-to-end-conflict-iaf-on-op-sindoor-details-why-pak-asked-for-ceasefire/articleshow/123600869.cms,"After Operation Sindoor, IAF Pushes For More Rafale Jets To Stem Depletion Of Fighter Squadrons

NEW DELHI: Vice Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal Narmdeshwar Tiwari on Saturday said that fewer than 50 weapons were fired at targeted Pakistani military locations, compelling Islamabad to request the cessation of military hostilities by mid-day of May 10.Recounting the Operation Sindoor , Air Marshal Tiwari, during the NDTV Defence Summit, said that the IAF achieved ""complete domination"" over the Pakistan military through strikes executed following Pakistan's attack on the night of May 9 and 10.""I must tell you that it was a key takeaway for us that in less than 50 weapons, we were able to achieve complete domination. It has not happened before,"" Tiwari said.The senior IAF officer, who played a key role in Operation Sindoor, mentioned that some Pakistani targets ""taken out"" during the mission were not hit even during the 1971 war. ""We made every weapon count and that is a tacit acknowledgement of the capability of our planners and people who executed the missions,"" he added.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in territories controlled by Pakistan in response to the Pahalgam terror attack . The strikes led to four days of intense clashes, culminating in an agreement to halt military actions on May 10.The Vice Chief of Air Staff further elaborated on the sequence of events related to Operation Sindoor and presented graphic details of India's response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack.Air Marshal Tiwari stated that India was not inclined to escalate the situation following its strikes on Pakistani terror infrastructure on the early morning of May 7.""We expected a response and still kept it calibrated, and we engaged only military targets. But when the main attack came on the night of May 9-10, that was the time we decided that we needed to go and send the right message. We hit them pan-front,"" he remarked. ""There were targets which were taken out, which were not even taken out during the 1971 war. That is the kind of extent and damage to capability that we had caused to them,"" he said, adding that the IAF limited its strikes to only military targets.The senior IAF officer explained that the purpose behind the strikes was to eliminate Pakistan's capability and convey the ""right message"". He acknowledged that employing long-range vectors to target enemy positions involves risks, but the IAF executed the mission flawlessly.""The precision targeting from this range is very very essential as it is very risky because the longer the vector, you feel that there are more chances of collateral damage."" ""But to the credit of our planners and credit of people who executed the missions, we were able to take out each target precisely. We were able to ensure there was no collateral damage. This is not an easy game,"" he added.""You may have a long-range vector, but the work that goes behind making that vector or that weapon hit a target accurately is actually an effort of the whole team, not only the pilots who fired them. There are a lot of people on the ground who make that happen,"" he noted. Following the strikes on terror infrastructure, India informed Pakistan of its desire not to escalate the situation, clarifying that the strikes targeted terrorist bases. However, as Pakistan initiated a military retaliation, India responded strongly.","India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in territories controlled by Pakistan.

Ahead of PM Narendra Modi ’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday in China, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dialled Modi to say that while Ukraine was ready for a meeting with Putin, Russia continued to carry out “cynical strikes” killing dozens of civilians. He also sought an immediate ceasefire saying peace talks were not possible while fighting was still on.Zelenskyy briefed Modi about his meeting with President Donald Trump and European leaders in Washington this month and later said he had spoken to Modi to “coordinate” position with India ahead of the SCO summit in Tianjin, suggesting he expects the PM to stress ceasefire when he meets Putin on the margins of the summit. He in fact said Modi seemed ready to convey the “appropriate signal” to Putin.“We exchanged views on the ongoing conflict, its humanitarian aspect, and efforts to restore peace and stability. India extends full support to all efforts in this direction,” said Modi in a post on X. Capitals across the Western world, particularly Washington, will closely follow Modi’s meeting with Putin for the message he conveys to Putin on the war.Shortly before Zelenskyy and Modi spoke, external affairs minister S Jaishankar told his Finland counterpart Elina Valtonen in a phone conversation India should not be unfairly targeted over the Ukraine conflict. Jaishankar said in a post on X that the discussions centered around the Ukraine conflict and recalled that India has always advocated dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the conflict. Valtonen said just and lasting peace in Ukraine requires more pressure on Putin to engage in real negotiations.Both the conversations came against the backdrop of repeated and hostile targeting of India by senior Trump administration officials for its trade links with Russia. The US has imposed an additional 25 percent tariffs on India for its crude purchase from Russia and Trump’s trade advisor Peter Navarro last week went to the extent of calling the Ukraine situation Modi’s war.While the government has made it clear to the US it won’t budge on the red lines it has drawn in trade negotiations, and that its oil procurement will continue to be guided by national interests and strategic autonomy, it has also so far avoided a public spat with Washington, exercising what many have described as strategic restraint. “Almost two weeks have passed (since his meeting with Trump in White House), and during this time, when Russia should have been preparing for diplomacy, Moscow has given no positive signal – only carried out cynical strikes on civilian targets and killed dozens of our people,” said Zelenskyy in his readout of the conversation with Modi.He said the end of this war must begin with an immediate ceasefire and that this position is understood and supported by everyone. “It is impossible to speak meaningfully about peace while our cities and communities are under constant fire. India is ready to make the necessary efforts and to deliver the appropriate signal to Russia and other leaders during the meetings on the sidelines of the summit,” said Zelenskyy, adding he will be glad to meet the Prime Minister in the near future.","Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dialled Modi to say that while Ukraine was ready for a meeting with Putin, Russia continued to carry out “cynical strikes” killing dozens of civilians.

JAMMU/SRINAGAR: Torrential rain and back-to-back cloudbursts unleashed flash floods and landslides in J&K Saturday, killing 11 people in Ramban and Reasi districts and pushing the monsoon death toll across Jammu division this Aug to 122. Among the dead: a couple and their five children buried alive in a mountainside home.In Ramban, floodwaters tore through remote Rajgarh village, flattening two family homes and a school. Additional DC Varunjeet Charak said: “Bodies of four people were pulled out from debris.

India’s Languages Must Not Divide: Vice President Dhankhar | Strong Message Amid Rising Polarisation

,

NEW DELHI: Senior lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi, while making his arguments on the scope of a governor’s powers in assenting to bills, read out a passage from one of Justice Krishna Iyer’s judgments and compared the judge’s prowess in English with that of Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , incidentally both hailing from Kerala.Singhvi said unlike Justice Iyer’s English, which was lyrical and not difficult to understand, to fathom Tharoor’s English one would require a dictionary, a prowess which the MP uses to flummox many while responding to tricky or difficult questions. CJI B R Gavai said a Kerala HC judge is attempting to emulate Justice Iyer these days.After lunch break, Singhvi issued a clarification about his comments“I mentioned Tharoor in admiration and not in derogation.” The CJI in a lighter vein said, “Neither can we adjudicate that nor can we stop what will be said (about Singhvi’s remarks) on social media.”The bench, headed by CJI Gavai and comprising Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, PS Narsimha, and AS Chandurkar, focused on questions surrounding gubernatorial discretion. The bench noted that the Constituent Assembly had replaced the six-week timeline for a governor to act on a bill with the phrase “as soon as possible.”Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, argued that a state government cannot invoke Article 32 to seek a writ against a governor.Singhvi countered that a governor has no discretionary power to negate a bill passed by the assembly. He cautioned, “If a governor’s decisions are made non-justiciable, he could, rather than the people’s elected representatives, become the supreme law-making authority by merely consigning a bill to his cupboard. ”Singhvi explained that withholding a bill must be followed by returning it to the House for reconsideration. “If the House does not repass the bill, it falls through. This is the intended meaning of Article 200 regarding a governor’s power to withhold assent. Otherwise, the democratic will of the people could be subverted,” he said.The bench further asked whether a governor could reserve a bill for the President if it conflicted with central law. Singhvi replied that a governor may reserve a bill for the President when first presented. “If the House approves it again, with or without amendments, the governor has no option but to give assent,” he clarified.Concluding, Singhvi emphasised that a governor is merely an 'ornamental head' of the state.Arguments from states opposing presidential references are expected to continue on Tuesday.","Senior lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi compared the judge's prowess in English with that of Congress MP Shashi Tharoor.

'Using our dollars to buy Russian oil': Navarro attacks India again; takes 'laundromat' jibe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/using-our-dollars-to-buy-russian-oil-navarro-attacks-india-again-takes-laundromat-jibe/articleshow/123575327.cms,"Trump's Trade Advisor Blames PM Modi for Ukraine War, Peter Navarro Targets India Over Russia Oil

Poll What should India prioritize in response to US tariffs? Adjust trade strategy Maintain independent policy

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump’s trade advisor Peter Navarro on Friday renewed his attack on India, accusing New Delhi of using American trade dollars to finance Russia’s war in Ukraine.Justifying Washington’s newly imposed 50 per cent tariffs on Indian imports, Navarro said that Indian refiners, working with “silent Russian partners,” were making huge profits by refining Russian oil and selling it in international markets while “Russia pockets hard currency to fund its war on Ukraine.”In a post on X, Navarro said, “India uses our dollars to buy discounted Russian crude. This isn’t just about India’s unfair trade—it’s about cutting off the financial lifeline India has extended to Putin’s war machine.”According to Navarro, “Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian oil made up less than 1% of India’s imports. Today? Over 30% -- more than 1.5 million barrels a day. This surge isn’t driven by domestic demand—it’s driven by Indian profiteers and carries an added price of blood and devastation in Ukraine.”Also read - 'Trump won't budge' : US says Russia-Ukraine conflict is 'Modi's war' “India’s Big Oil lobby has turned the largest democracy in the world into a massive refining hub and oil money laundromat for the Kremlin,” he claimed, adding that India now exports more than 1 million barrels a day in refined petroleum, over half of the Russian crude it imports.Navarro said the Biden administration “largely looked the other way at this madness,” while President Trump was confronting it directly. “A 50% tariff -- 25% for unfair trade and 25% for national security -- is a direct response. If India, the world’s largest democracy, wants to be treated like a strategic partner of the US, it needs to act like one. The road to peace in Ukraine runs through New Delhi.”Also read - Western voices back India against Trump's tariff war Expanding on the criticism, he remarked, “While the United States pays to arm Ukraine, India bankrolls Russia even as it slaps some of the world’s highest tariffs on US goods, which in turn punishes American exporters. We run a $50-billion trade deficit with India—and they’re using our dollars to buy Russian oil. They make a killing and Ukrainians die.”“It doesn’t stop there. India continues to buy Russian weapons—while demanding that US firms transfer sensitive military tech and build plants in India. That’s strategic freeloading,” he added.The remarks follow Donald Trump’s decision earlier this week to double tariffs on Indian imports, citing both trade imbalances and national security concerns.Navarro told Bloomberg TV that it was “real easy” for India to get the penalty removed by halting Russian oil purchases, but accused New Delhi of being “arrogant” in insisting it was their sovereign right.“India, you’re the biggest democracy in the world, okay? Act like one... side with the democracies...(instead) you’re getting in bed with the authoritarians,” he said, reminding India of its long-standing border dispute with China. “These are not your friends folks, okay? And the Russians. I mean, come on!”Navarro also controversially referred to the Russia-Ukraine conflict as “Modi’s war,” insisting India’s purchases were funding Moscow’s aggression. When an anchor corrected him, saying “you mean Putin’s war,” Navarro doubled down, repeating it was “Modi’s war.”While Navarro praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi as “a great leader” and India as “a mature democracy with intelligent people running it,” he maintained that New Delhi’s oil deals with Moscow undermined its claim to be a trusted US partner.His comments have drawn criticism within US policy circles, with some analysts pointing out that Washington has not penalised China or the European Union for continuing to buy Russian energy. Others noted that the US itself imports Russian nuclear fuel and precious metals.",US President Donald Trump’s trade advisor Peter Navarro on Friday renewed his attack on India.

Israeli airstrikes in Yemen’s capital Sanaa have killed Ahmed al-Rahawi, prime minister of the Houthi-controlled government, the Iran-backed rebels said Saturday.According to the Houthis, al-Rahawi and several ministers died in a Thursday strike while attending a government workshop. The Israeli military confirmed it had “precisely struck a Houthi terrorist regime target” in Sanaa, AP reported.Al-Rahawi, in office since August 2024, was a key figure in the rebel administration. The Houthis, who have fired missiles and drones at Israel and targeted Red Sea shipping in solidarity with Palestinians during the Gaza war, remain undeterred despite most attacks being intercepted.The Houthis have repeatedly launched missiles against Israel throughout Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. The group says the attacks are in solidarity with the Palestinians. Though most of the missiles launched by Yemen are intercepted by Israel or fragment mid-air, this has done little to deter the attacks.Earlier in the week, Israeli strikes hit multiple areas across Sanaa, killing at least 10 people and wounding 102 others, according to the Houthi-run health ministry and govt officials.The Houthis have launched missiles and drones toward Israel and targeted ships in the Red Sea throughout Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza.

Melania Trump for Nobel Peace Prize?

Melania Trump Hit With Vanity Fair Humiliation AND Newsom’s Savage Parody | WATCH





Could Melania Trump soon find herself in the company of Nobel laureates like Nelson Mandela and Malala Yousafzai ? One of Donald Trump ’s closest Republican allies thinks so.Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna has floated the idea that the former First Lady may be nominated for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, not just her husband.Luna told Fox News that Melania has been “very instrumental” in quiet discussions with Russia and could be “a key reason” why peace in Ukraine eventually takes shape.Trump has already received multiple nominations for the prize from the governments of Rwanda, Israel, Gabon, Azerbaijan, and Cambodia, along with various individuals. Bookmakers currently place his odds of winning at nearly 29%, on par with Russian activist Yulia Navalnaya.Adding intrigue, earlier this month, Trump carried a personal letter from Melania to Vladimir Putin during a summit in Alaska. The message, released by her office, urged the Russian leader to “protect the innocence of children” and painted a sweeping vision of “a dignity-filled world for all.”While some reports suggested the note referenced kidnapped Ukrainian children, the letter stayed vague, focusing instead on humanity’s duty to future generations.The meeting ended without progress, and Russian strikes on Ukraine continue. But Trump’s allies remain adamant that both he and Melania deserve global recognition.Steve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, even told the president at a Cabinet meeting, “You are the single finest candidate since this Nobel award was ever talked about.”The Nobel Peace Prize can be awarded to up to three people or groups. The 2025 winner will be announced on October 10.","Florida Rep.

Trump's Rival Democrats Blast Tariff on India, Call Out Move 'Hurting Americans', Sabotaging Ties

'Total disaster for US'



Trump went too far



What next?





US President Donald Trump on Friday said that he would ""fight back"" after a US federal court in a significant ruling found his global tariffs ""illegal.""The US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington ruled that many of Trump's tariffs were illegal; however, it allowed them to remain in place for now, giving the US president time to take the matter to the Supreme Court.A furious Trump termed the court ruling ""incorrect,"" saying that ""ALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT!""""Today, a Highly Partisan Appeals Court incorrectly said that our Tariffs should be removed, but they know the United States of America will win in the end,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Blown by the decision, Trump flagged that if tariffs ever went away, it would be a ""total disaster"" for US, adding that the country ""will no longer tolerate enormous Trade Deficits and unfair Tariffs and Non-Tariff Trade Barriers imposed by other Countries, friend or foe.""""The USA will no longer tolerate enormous Trade Deficits and unfair Tariffs and Non-Tariff Trade Barriers imposed by other Countries, friend or foe, that undermine our Manufacturers, Farmers, and everyone else,"" he added.""If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,"" Trump wrote further.The US president underlined that the tariffs imposed by him on several countries, which resulted in a trade war, are ""best tool"" for US workers and ""support Companies that produce great MADE IN AMERICA products.""Trump said that for many years tariffs were used against US but now he will approach Supreme Court to make America ""Rich, Strong, and Powerful Again.""The 7-4 ruling by the US court observed: ""The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax,"" as quoted by Reuters.The decision also noted that the US president had exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).Federal court's ruling has thrown a roadblock to Trump's path after he audaciously claimed unlimited power to bypass Congress and imposed tariffs on several countries, friends and foes.The decision was centred on tariffs Trump imposed on almost every country on earth on April 2, calling it 'Liberation Day,' as well as levies on China, Mexico, and Canada.The court stated that he overstepped when he declared national emergencies to justify imposing tariffs on several countries.If tariffs are struck down, the US administration argued that it will have to refund some of the import taxes that were collected. It will be a major financial blow for US treasury. According to news report from AP, by July the revenue from tariffs totalled to $159 billion, more than expected. The justice department earlier had said that revoking the tariffs could mean ""financial ruin"" for America.""While existing trade deals may not automatically unravel, the administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy, which may embolden foreign governments to resist future demands, delay implementation of prior commitments, or even seek to renegotiate terms,"" Ashley Akers, a former justice department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court decision, as quoted by AP.Meanwhile, Trump declared on his social media platform that he will take the fight to the Supreme Court. ""If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,"" he wrote.While the president still has other legal tools to levy import taxes, they are far more limited. The Trade Act of 1974, for example, allows tariffs of only up to 15% and for a maximum of 150 days against countries with which the U.S. runs large trade deficits.Another option is Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 — the basis for past tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos. But that route requires a formal Commerce Department investigation and cannot be triggered at the president’s discretion.","US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington ruled that many of Trump's tariffs were illegal.

US President Donald Trump is all over X as a trend, and it has nothing to do with his infamously spontaneous comments, a new round of tariffs, or a fiery campaign address. Rather, the term ""Trump Is Dead"" swept the social media platform, causing a viral storm that sent users scrolling frantically for clarification.Vice President JD Vance's open interview with USA Today on August 27 sparked the discussion. His comments about being prepared to assume the presidency in case of a ""terrible tragedy"" befalling President Trump set tongues wagging. The timing of these remarks drew attention within the political landscape as keyboard warriors started connecting dots to the prominent bruise on Trump's right hand that went viral.Stemming from that, Trump faces enhanced scrutiny regarding his health condition. While manageable, it has added another layer to ongoing discussions about presidential health.The vice president's statement has become a notable point of discussion in political circles. Though he emphasised that Trump is ""in incredibly good health,"" his statement, intended to demonstrate leadership preparedness, backfired.The media coverage of this event has expanded beyond the initial interview, becoming a significant topic of discussion across various platforms.The story has generated substantial engagement on social media platforms, particularly on X.Below are some tweets that hit off:Some even went back to a statement by The Simpsons creator Matt Groening. Groening quipped, ""The show would keep running until somebody dies. When you-know-who dies, The Simpsons predicts there will be dancing in the streets. Except President Vance will ban dancing,"" while speaking at San Diego Comic-Con in July. Longtime believers of Simpson's prophecies found it to be yet another unsettling addition to the show's history of making scary predictions, which also included Trump's 2016 triumph, his presidential campaign, and even a plot regarding his reelection years in advance.Naturally, this is not the first time that erroneous claims of Trump's passing have caused a stir on the internet. Hackers momentarily took over Donald Trump Jr's X account in September 2023 and posted a false statement stating the president had passed away. Trump, who was still alive and willing to make fun of the situation, debunked the hoax on social media within hours.","Vice President JD Vance's open interview with USA Today on August 27 sparked the discussion.

INDORE: A missing case in Indore that kept police and family members on edge for nearly a week took a dramatic turn with a twist straight out of a film script.Twenty-two-year-old Shraddha Tiwari, who went missing from her home on August 23, returned on Friday morning, but not alone. She arrived at MIG police station with a man named Karan Yogi, claiming he was now her husband.Shraddha stated that she initially stepped out of her house to meet her boyfriend, Sarthak Gehlot. But, when he failed to turn up at railway station where they had planned to meet, she boarded a train to Ratlam in anger.There, she allegedly attempted to end her life by jumping off the moving train, but was stopped by Karan, an old acquaintance who once worked as an electrician at the college where Shraddha studied, said MIG police station in charge CB Singh.Singh said that Karan told them that when he stopped Shraddha, she told him that if he really wanted to save her, he should marry her.He agreed and the two went on a tour to Khargone and then Maheshwar, where they exchanged vows in a temple. Later, they went to Karan's family home in Palia, but after facing opposition from his relatives, they reached Mandsaur before finally returning to Indore.Singh said, ""While the story seems fabricated since she is not a minor, she can marry anyone.It is suspected that she knew Karan beforehand.""Additional DCP Amrendra Singh said that the case has been closed. The story has sparked controversy within Shraddha's family.

US President Donald Trump has expressed uncertainty over arranging direct talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, though he suggested trilateral discussions involving himself could still take place.In an interview with the Daily Caller published Saturday, Trump said he doubted a one-on-one meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy would happen anytime soon. “A tri would happen. A bi, I don’t know about, but a tri will happen,” he said.Trump added that sometimes conflicts need to “fight for a little bit before you can get them to stop.”Trump also told the outlet he was willing to consider limited US air support as part of security guarantees to help Europe secure an end to the war. “They’re not our soldiers, but there are, five to 7,000, mostly young people, being killed every single week. If I could stop that and have a plane flying around the air every once in a while, it’s going to be mostly the Europeans, but we’d help them,” Trump said, while ruling out “boots on the ground. ”Speaking to the Daily Caller, Trump defended the approach against critics who argue it undermines his “America First” stance.“We sell equipment to Nato. They pay for the equipment. We’re not spending any money in the war,” he said.According to CBS News, Zelenskyy on Friday voiced frustration at Russia’s delays, accusing Moscow of avoiding serious talks. He said the Kremlin’s demand to settle issues through lower-level officials before a summit was “artificial … because they want to show the United States that they are constructive, but they are not constructive.”Zelenskyy insisted leaders “must urgently be involved to reach agreements.”Despite these efforts, fighting has intensified. Russia’s military chief Valery Gerasimov said Moscow’s forces had seized more than 1,351 square miles of Ukrainian territory since March and were pressing deeper into the Dnipropetrovsk region.Over the weekend, Ukraine reported Russian airstrikes killing at least one civilian and wounding 28, including children, in Zaporizhzhia.While Trump maintains he still hopes to mediate, Moscow has so far resisted a direct meeting with Kyiv, even as Russian forces continue large-scale assaults across Ukraine.",US President Donald Trump has expressed uncertainty over arranging direct talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

NEW DELHI: A birthday celebration in northwest Delhi’s KN Katju Marg turned into tragedy after a quarrel over gifts escalated into a double murder, police said.According to investigators, Priya Sehgal (34) allegedly made an uncharitable remark about her husband’s family not bringing gifts during their younger son’s 15th birthday celebrations.Enraged, her husband Yogesh Sehgal attacked her with a pair of scissors, stabbing her in the neck, before turning on his mother-in-law Kusum Sinha (63).Both women died on the spot.The killings came to light when Priya’s brother, Megh Sinha, reached her Rohini flat and found the house in disarray.“When I lifted my mother, I noticed deep injuries on her throat and abdomen, with blood flowing from the wounds,” he told reporters.Megh later learnt that Yogesh had gone to the police station, accusing his wife and mother-in-law of assaulting him.Police said Yogesh attempted to clean the scene, locked the flat, and waited for his sons to return from school. He later roamed around with them until he was arrested in Rohini.Investigators added that the couple’s frequent domestic disputes had worsened in recent months, and the birthday-related remark appeared to have triggered the fatal violence.Brother of Priya, told PTI, ""My mother had gone to my sister's house a day before and told us she would return the next day. When we called her in between, she said there was a fight going on between my sister and her husband, and that she would help sort it out and then come back. But she never returned. We kept calling her the next morning around 11,00 am, 11.30 am and again at 12, but neither she nor my sister picked up. We thought maybe they were asleep. By afternoon, we decided to go and check. When we reached the house and knocked, we saw blood stains on the lock.""He said that when they went in, they found his mother and sister lying soaked in blood.""We went to their house around 3.30 pm. My brother-in-law had killed them and fled with the children. Who does this? Everybody has fights in a marriage, they have been married for 17 years. But who kills their wife and mother-in-law like this?

‘Stay tuned!’: White House pushes plan to revive ‘department of war’; to mark a shift from ‘woke ideology’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/stay-tuned-white-house-pushes-plan-to-revive-department-of-war-to-mark-a-shift-from-woke-ideology/articleshow/123610336.cms,"Donald Trump (AP)





The Donald Trump administration is considering renaming the Department of Defense to its former title, the Department of War, according to a White House official.Speaking to Fox News on Saturday, deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said the potential rebrand is part of a broader effort to ""restore traditional US military values.""“As President Trump said, our military should be focused on offense, not just defense,” Kelly stated. “That’s why he has prioritized warfighters at the Pentagon instead of DEI and woke ideology. Stay tuned!"" Kelly said.The name change would typically require Congressional approval, though the White House is reportedly exploring alternative routes to implement the change unilaterally.Earlier, the Republican Party's Florida representative, Greg Steube, introduced an amendment to the annual defense policy bill that would formally rename the department. While no concrete path has been outlined by the administration, Trump has repeatedly emphasized the importance of projecting military strength.At a Nato summit in June, Trump referred to defense secretary Pete Hegseth as “secretary of war” and publicly floated the idea of returning to the department’s original name.""The Department of Defense. It didn’t sound good to me. It used to be called the Department of War, and it had a stronger sound,” Trump said at a White House event earlier this week.“Defense? I don’t want to be defense only—we want offense too.”He continued: “We won World War I and World War II. It was called the Department of War. That’s really what it is. I’m talking to the people. Everybody likes that. We had an unbelievable history of victory when it was the Department of War. Then we changed it to the Department of Defense.”The Department of War was the original name of the executive branch body responsible for US military affairs until the National Security Act of 1947 restructured the military command and created the National Military Establishment.A subsequent 1949 amendment renamed it the Department of Defense, consolidating the Army, Navy, and newly established Air Force under a single civilian-led structure headquartered at the Pentagon.Then-US president Harry Truman championed the shift to strengthen centralized authority - especially over the Navy - under the Pentagon. The Navy had maintained significant independence through World War II.","Deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said the potential rebrand is part of a broader effort to ""restore traditional US military values"" The name change would typically require Congressional approval, though the White House is reportedly exploring alternative routes to implement the change unilaterally.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123610663,imgsize-934433,width-400,resizemode-4/donald-trump-ap.jpg"
‘Use paper ballots only’: Donald Trump vows executive order on voter ID; seeks mail-in voting only for ill and military,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/use-paper-ballots-only-donald-trump-vows-executive-order-on-voter-id-seeks-mail-in-voting-only-for-ill-and-military/articleshow/123610120.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)





US President Donald Trump announced plans on late Saturday to issue an executive order that would make voter identification mandatory and restrict mail-in voting.“Voter ID must be part of every single vote. No exceptions! I will be doing an executive order to that end!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.He added, “Also, No Mail-In Voting, except for those that are very ill, and the far away military. Use paper ballots only!!!”.The post builds on Trump’s repeated pledges to overhaul US voting systems. A few days ago, he said the order was being prepared “by the best lawyers in the country” to eliminate mail-in ballots, reported The New York Times.Trump argued that Republicans needed to “get tough and stop it” because, in his view, Democrats benefited disproportionately from the practice.Mail-in and absentee voting accounted for just over 30 per cent of ballots in the 2024 elections, according to news agency AFP. Although Trump and his allies have repeatedly claimed the system is open to fraud, experts and officials have stressed there is no evidence postal voting is less secure than in-person voting.Pro-democracy groups have also warned that scrapping it could disenfranchise millions of Americans, particularly those with disabilities or other barriers to reaching polling places.Constitutionally, the president does not have the authority to unilaterally change election rules. The power to regulate the “times, places and manner” of elections lies with state legislatures, and only Congress can override those laws. As The New York Times noted, any executive order targeting mail-in ballots or voting procedures would face immediate legal challenges.Trump has previously relied on absentee voting himself, including during Florida’s 2020 primaries. His critics argue the push to end mail-in voting is politically motivated, pointing out that Democrats have historically outnumbered Republicans in using postal ballots.","US President Donald Trump announced plans on late Saturday to issue an executive order that would make voter ID mandatory and restrict mail-in voting.

Haunting Yearbook Photo Emerges of Minnesota Mass Shooter Robin Westman Living as a Woman





Weeks before a gunman opened fire at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, killing two children and injuring 18 others, the Trump administration cut funding for a Minnesota program intended to prevent acts of mass violence, according to documents cited by the New York Times.In July, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced $18.5 million in spending cuts from the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (CP3).About $700,000 of that funding had been allocated to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety (DPS) for roles aimed at preventing targeted violence and terrorism.DPS Commissioner Bob Jacobson wrote to the state’s congressional delegation at the time that “without this funding, our capacity to protect our communities from targeted violence and terrorism will be significantly diminished.”DPS spokesperson Jill Oliveira was quoted as saying by the New York Times that since the cuts, the agency had cancelled a statewide training conference and redirected resources to cover costs.Previous CP3 funding, she said, supported training for law enforcement, schools, and faith institutions in threat prevention.The Trump administration argued the program was misused. In its letter to Minnesota authorities, DHS said CP3 grants were “no longer in line” with its priorities, citing immigration enforcement, border security and combating antisemitism.A Homeland Security official said in a statement that CP3 had been used for “left-wing ideologies and did next to nothing to combat actual threats.” The official also said that many grants had gone to groups that “celebrated and encouraged transgenderism in children,” a remark that drew criticism from Democrats.The cuts also impacted the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office, which had received about $100,000 for multidisciplinary threat-assessment work, according to CNN. A former DHS employee told the outlet the Minneapolis attack was “100% preventable. This was exactly the kind of event we could have stopped.”The assailant, Robin Westman, left behind journals expressing surprise at evading detection. “Should be harder for people like me to carry out these attacks,” he wrote, as reported by CNN.In one journal entry, he wrote, “I have been showing signs for a while. I need to be stopped! … If I did something, they would say it was obvious in hindsight.”Jacob Ware, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, was quoted as saying by CNN that “the capacity to combat domestic terrorism is eroding. It seems like the focus on prevention has slipped in this country.”Minnesota lawmakers criticised the decision. Sen. Tina Smith said, “This shooting was horrific, and to think we had a strategy in place aimed at preventing this type of violence is tragic.”Rep. Betty McCollum added that cancelling the grant “limits our state law enforcement from access to vital federal counterterrorism partners and resources and leaves Minnesota communities more vulnerable.”The attack followed an earlier June assassination plot that killed a state representative and her husband and wounded a senator and his wife, events that further fuel concerns about weakened prevention efforts.After the shooting, US First Lady Melania Trump urged more proactive measures, posting on X, “To prevent future tragedies, it is crucial we look into behavioural threat assessments across all levels of society … Being aware of these warning signs and acting quickly can save lives and make American communities safer.”","In July, the Department of Homeland Security announced $18.5 million in spending cuts from the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (CP3) About $700,000 of that funding had been allocated to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety for roles aimed at preventing targeted violence and terrorism.

Netanyahu's Gaza Plan Faces Opposition By Hostages Kin; Massive Rallies Across Israel | Watch





Israeli security forces have recovered the remains of two people killed in the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s office confirmed.As per The New York Times, the bodies were identified as 56-year-old Ilan Weiss and 28-year-old Idan Shtivi.The Israeli military and domestic intelligence agency Shin Bet said the operation was a “complex rescue mission,” without disclosing when or where it took place.Weiss, a civilian emergency team leader, was killed in his home community of Be’eri during the attack in which militants raided southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and abducting around 250, according to Israeli officials. His wife, Shiri, and teenage daughter, Noga, were taken hostage but later freed during a ceasefire in November 2023, the NYT reported.Shtivi was killed near the Nova music festival, where 360 people lost their lives and several others were abducted. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said he had gone to the festival grounds to photograph friends.According to The Sun US, Shtivi was abducted from the Tel Gama area, “brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists after acting to rescue and evacuate others” from the site. His body was taken to Gaza and held for 693 days before being returned.Netanyahu vowed Israel would not stop its efforts to bring back both living hostages and the dead. “We will not rest or be silent until we return all of our hostages home, both the living and the dead,” he said Friday, as quoted by The Sun US.The recovery of the two bodies comes as Israel intensifies its Gaza offensive. According to the NYT, the Israeli security cabinet has approved a plan to expand operations into Gaza City, where several hundred thousand Palestinians remain.Israeli defence minister Israel Katz’s office said, “We will not rest until everyone returns home — this is the objective of the upcoming maneuver.”Palestinian health officials say more than 63,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of Israel’s military campaign. On Saturday, Israeli airstrikes killed at least 17 people in Gaza City, while targeting what officials described as a “key” Hamas figure.The war, which began after Hamas’ October 7 assault, has left Israel still holding that around 20 hostages are alive in Gaza, with the bodies of roughly 30 more captives also believed to remain there.","Ilan Weiss, 56, and Idan Shtivi, 28, were killed in Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023.

In a major development of the H-1B row, the US President Donald Trump-led administration is taking action against companies which are discriminating against American workers.The programme, which allows foreign workers to fill roles in the US, has long been criticised for limiting opportunities for native-born Americans.Assistant attorney general for Civil Rights, Harmeet Dhillon, confirmed to Patrick Reports that the department of justice’s (DoJ) civil rights division is actively investigating civil rights complaints linked to the H-1B programme.“Through our Protecting US Workers Initiative, the Civil Rights Division’s Immigrant and Employee Rights section has numerous open investigations into hiring practices that discriminate against American citizens, and the list continues to grow,” InfoWars quoted Dhillon.She further added, “We encourage anyone aware of such practices to notify the Civil Rights Division so we can determine if an investigation and enforcement action is needed.”The Indian-American Trump aide took to social media platform X calling out people to send leads against employers.“We have several open investigations and have taken action against some employers already! Send us your leads!”Dhillon has long criticized the H-1B system.""The H1B system is broken and needs reform. What does that have to do with medical education? Nothing, and it’s lazy to conflate the two broken systems,"" she had said earlier.The H-1B visa programme is capped at 85,000 new visas per year, excluding renewals for existing holders. Workers on these visas are often dependent on their employers for legal status, allowing companies to treat them more harshly than American employees and giving them an advantage in the hiring process.The Trump-era department of labour (DOL) also faced scrutiny from the Office of Inspector General over its handling of H-2B applications.While critics argue that the system continues to favour foreign workers, the DOJ’s renewed focus on protecting American employees offers a potential turning point. Citizen activists and job-seekers are now calling for continued pressure to ensure cases of H-1B-related discrimination are prosecuted and legal precedents are set to protect non-visa workers.","The US President Donald Trump-led administration is taking action against companies which are discriminating against American workers.

‘Forcibly removed’: Senator Ron Wyden warns against Trump admin's plan to deport over 600 Guatemalan children,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/forcibly-removed-senator-ron-wyden-warns-against-trump-admins-plan-to-deport-over-600-guatemalan-children/articleshow/123593917.cms,"Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon (Pic credit: AP)

Guatemala willing to take back minors

‘Forcibly removed’ without asylum

Advocacy groups slam move





The Trump administration is preparing to deport nearly 700 Guatemalan children who entered the United States without their parents, according to a letter sent Friday by Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, reported AP.In his letter to Angie Salazar, the acting director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) under the Department of Health and Human Services, Wyden warned that such removals would violate the ORR’s “child welfare mandate” and America’s long-standing obligation towards unaccompanied minors.“This move threatens to separate children from their families, lawyers, and support systems, to thrust them back into the very conditions they are seeking refuge from, and to disappear vulnerable children beyond the reach of American law and oversight,” Wyden wrote, urging the administration to scrap the plan.The planned deportations are part of the Trump administration’s broader immigration crackdown, which includes surging enforcement officers to Chicago, escalating deportations, and rolling back protections for migrants who had been allowed to live and work in the US.Guatemalan Foreign Affairs Minister Carlos Martínez said his government had informed Washington that it was prepared to take in several hundred children currently held in US facilities.He noted particular concern for minors who risk being transferred to adult detention centres once they turn 18.The number under discussion is a little over 600—almost double the 341 minors the country had previously agreed to repatriate, officials confirmed. Danilo Rivera, director of Guatemala’s Immigration Institute, had earlier said the aim was to bring the children back before they reached adulthood. He added that the process would be managed at Guatemala’s expense and would be classified as “voluntary return.”President Bernardo Arévalo has backed the plan, stressing that the government has both a legal and moral duty to advocate for the children. His comments followed a visit to Guatemala by US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.Wyden’s letter, citing whistleblowers, claimed that children without a parent or legal guardian as a sponsor, or without an active asylum case, “will be forcibly removed from the country.”“Unaccompanied children are some of the most vulnerable children entrusted to the government’s care,” he wrote. “In many cases, these children and their families have had to make the unthinkable choice to face danger and separation in search of safety.”Neither the White House nor the Department of Health and Human Services commented on the matter, which was first reported by CNN.The proposal has alarmed immigrant rights advocates. “We are outraged by the Trump administration’s renewed assault on the rights of immigrant children,” said Lindsay Toczylowski, president and CEO of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center. “We are not fooled by their attempt to mask these efforts as mere ‘repatriations.’ This is yet another calculated attempt to sever what little due process remains in the immigration system. ”Children traveling to the US without parents or guardians are typically handed over to ORR upon apprehension at the border. They are placed in government-supervised shelters or foster care until a sponsor—often a family member—is identified. Many also seek asylum, juvenile immigration status, or visas reserved for victims of exploitation.Advocates have already challenged in court the Trump administration’s tougher vetting procedures for unaccompanied children, arguing that the changes are inhumane and prolong family separations.",Guatemala willing to take back hundreds of children who entered the US without their parents.

‘You can’t mimic the king’: JD Vance again mocks Gavin Newsom’s Donald Trump-style posts; calls it ‘cheap imitation’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/you-cant-mimic-the-king-jd-vance-again-mocks-gavin-newsoms-donald-trump-style-posts-calls-it-cheap-imitation/articleshow/123580503.cms,"JD Vance again mocks Gavin Newsom’s Donald Trump-style posts (Picture credit: AP)

The Chaos That Erupted Just Moments Before Vance Was Booed At Union Station Revealed





US Vice President JD Vance has again criticised California Governor Gavin Newsom’s new social media strategy, saying his attempt to copy President Donald Trump ’s style lacks authenticity.In an interview with Fox News host Will Cain, Vance argued that Newsom cannot replicate Trump’s appeal. “He's trying to be a fake copy of Trump and it just doesn't work. You can't mimic the king. You can’t mimic the master; you ought to just go and be yourself. And I think the people would like that a lot more than a cheap imitation of the president of the United States,” he said.The comments follow a string of posts from Newsom’s press office in August that mirrored Trump’s online persona — using capital letters, mocking nicknames and emphatic sign-offs.One viral post declared, “WOW! TOMORROW HISTORY WILL BE MADE… DONALD ‘THE FAILURE’ TRUMP BE WARNED, TOMORROW MAY BE THE WORST DAY OF YOUR LIFE. LIBERATION DAY FOR AMERICA!!! — GCN.”Cain noted that the approach may be resonating with Democrats, pointing to a Morning Consult poll showing Newsom’s support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents rose by eight points between June and late August.However, Vance dismissed the tactic as inauthentic. “When I see Gavin Newsom trying to act like Donald Trump, that’s the opposite of authenticity.He’s not trying to be Gavin Newsom — whoever that is. He’s trying to be a fake carbon copy of Donald Trump, and it just doesn’t work,” he said.Vance emphasised that Trump’s enduring influence comes from being genuine. “The lesson of President Trump in American politics is you’ve got to be authentic to yourself,” he added. “People liked his posts because they spoke to his authenticity. With Newsom, it’s a cheap replication.”Newsom defended his approach earlier this month, saying he wanted to highlight the double standards around Trump’s social media behaviour. “I’m sort of following his example,” he said in a press conference, according to The Wrap. “If you’ve got issues with what I’m putting out, you sure as hell should have concerns about what he’s putting out as president.”In an earlier interview, Vance has also warned Democrats more broadly against drawing the wrong lesson from Trump’s success. “This idea that Gavin Newsom is somehow going to mimic Donald Trump’s style — I think that ignores the fundamental genius of President Trump’s political success, which is that he’s authentic,” he said on Fox News’s The Ingraham Angle.Vance went further, offering blunt advice, “The autopsy for the Democrats… is stop sounding like crazy people. Don’t be a crazy person. Be authentic.”","JD Vance again mocks Gavin Newsom’s Donald Trump-style posts. ‘He's trying to be a fake copy of Trump and it just doesn't work.
