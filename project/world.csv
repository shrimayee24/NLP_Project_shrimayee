Rahul Gandhi heads to Hathras amid Sambhal row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-gandhi-heads-to-hathras-amid-sambhal-row/articleshow/116234547.cms,"NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi on Thursday headed to Hathras in Uttar Pradesh, a day after the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha along with Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi paid a visit to the families of five people who died in the Sambhal violence on November 24.Security arrangements were amped up in Boolgarhi village as he might meet the family of the 2020 rape victim.Reacting to his visit, state deputy chief minister Brajesh Pathak said, ""Rahul Gandhi, you have a feeling of despair, you are a victim of frustration. You do not even know that the CBI has investigated Hathras case. The case is going on in the court...Today Uttar Pradesh is moving ahead rapidly to become the number 1 state in terms of infrastructure, in terms of law and order. The law and order of Uttar Pradesh is discussed in the whole nation. Today we can say that industrial revolution is coming in Uttar Pradesh.""""Whereas you want to throw Uttar Pradesh into the fire of anarchy, in the fire of riots, you want to incite people. Please do not do this, I request you that Uttar Pradesh is getting ready to become the number 1 state in the whole nation,"" he added.Rahul had met the family in 2020 and had also accused the Yogi Adityanath-government of ""exploitation"" and unleashing ""atrocities"" on the victim's family.""See, #Hathras what kind of exploitation and atrocities the victim's family had to face at the hands of the UP government. It is very important for every Indian to know the truth about the injustice done to him,"" he had said in a post on X.Exactly four years after the brutal murder and alleged sexual assault of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras on September 14, 2020, her family has yet to immerse her ashes, stating they are still waiting for justice. In an interview with TOI, the family expressed their frustration, saying they continue to live in ""jail-like conditions"" with restrictions on their movement and social interactions, while being surrounded by security personnel 24/7.The family also highlighted that promises made by the government, such as providing a job for a family member and a house, have remained unfulfilled. They further expressed their disappointment over the legal proceedings, with three of the accused being acquitted and only one sentenced to life imprisonment. According to the family, the release of the alleged perpetrators has denied them justice.","Rahul Gandhi on Thursday headed to Hathras in Uttar Pradesh, a day after the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha along with Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi paid a visit to the families of five people who died in the Sambhal violence.

Can kin be prosecuted for abetting bigamy? SC says proof holds key,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-kin-be-prosecuted-for-abetting-bigamy-sc-says-proof-holds-key/articleshow/116225880.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Can relatives of a man or woman, contracting a second marriage during the subsistence of his/her first marriage, be prosecuted for abetting the offence of bigamy under Section 494 of IPC/ Section 82 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita?Rajasthan HC took cue from SC's 2018 judgment in Joseph Shine that decriminalised adultery punishable under Section 497 of IPC, and had ruled ""the ambit of bigamy is narrow and limited to erring spouses alone. It cannot be expanded or said to have a wider connotation by way of abetment"".The woman, whose husband had contracted second marriage, had challenged this ruling of HC, which had quashed the case lodged against the brother and mother of the second wife of the husband.Adjudicating whether abetment would accompany the crime of bigamy, a bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar said there cannot be presumption of non-involvement of other persons in the abetment of the crime as that would depend on the facts and evidence of each case. In the case in hand, the bench said no case of abetment is made out against the brother and mother of the second wife of the husband.However, it clarified that if during the trial on production of additional evidence, the first wife felt a case of abetment to bigamy is made out against other persons, she would be free to move the trial court under Section 319 of CRPC seeking to make them face trial as abettors .On HC's observations - ""the fact that bigamy is a compoundable, bailable and non-cognisable offence, reveals the peculiar nature of an offence"" - hinting that bigamy is a not a serious crime, the bench said SC has repeatedly ruled bigamy is a serious offence.","Rajasthan HC took cue from SC's 2018 judgment in Joseph Shine that decriminalised adultery punishable under Section 497 of IPC.

UP boy pushes mom to death

, hides truth from TN-based dad for 5 days

GORAKHPUR: The 17-year-old son of an assistant scientist with Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (Barc) was arrested in UP's Gorakhpur Wednesday after he allegedly confessed to fatally injuring his mother and keeping the news from his father, who is based at Kalpakkam in Tamil Nadu, for five days.Investigators quoted the Class 11 student as saying that he pushed his mother in a fit of rage while arguing with her over something. She had purportedly scolded him in front of his classmates and teachers after learning during a visit to school on Dec 1 that her son hadn't been attending classes regularly.Additional SP (North) Jitendra Kumar Srivastava said that on Dec 3, the boy's mother asked him to go to school, but he refused. ""He asked for some money afterwards, and his mother allegedly threw cash at him. The boy told us he was furious and pushed his mother, resulting in her head crashing against a wall. She became unconscious and the boy left her like that.""On returning from school, the teenager found his mother dead. He allegedly locked the house and went to stay with a friend who lives in the neighbourhood.The Barc scientist didn't know about it until he telephoned his wife repeatedly, only to find his calls going unanswered. When he spoke to his son, the latter misled him into believing that his wife was busy with something. The boy then stopped taking his father's calls.On Dec 7, the scientist asked his sister-in-law to visit their home and find out what the matter was. She found out that her sister had been dead for five days.The teenager initially claimed that his mother accidentally fell and died, after which he left the house in panic. The autopsy report contradicted the claim, police said. ""CCTV footage confirmed that no outsider entered the house. While searching the boy's room, we found currency notes in denominations of Rs 500, Rs 200, and Rs 100,"" an investigator said.Gorakhpur SSP Gaurav Grover said the arrested boy was being kept in a shelter for juveniles.","17-year-old son of an assistant scientist with Bhabha Atomic Research Centre was arrested in UP's Gorakhpur Wednesday.

AMRITSAR: Panthic organisations, not aligned with Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), have rallied to oppose the demand for excommunicating Narain Singh Chaura , who tried to assassinate SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal on December 4 at the Golden Temple .The Panthic factions met here on Wednesday to discuss Sikh sentiments, political situation in Punjab, and the honour and dignity of religious places. The group is expected to announce their next course of action on Thursday.It is learnt that Panthic functionaries have urged the acting Jathedar of Akal Takht , Bhai Dhian Singh Mand, to lead the movement and announce the conferment of ""Panth Rattan"" title upon Chaura, in consideration of the broader sentiments of the Sikh community.""Chaura's action largely reflects the prevailing sentiment and the deep dismay and utter disappointment felt by the people of Punjab, especially Sikhs, towards SAD,"" Bhai Jarnail Singh Sakhira, one of the functionaries present at the meeting, said. ""Many believed SAD represented their interests, but over time, the party became more focused on safeguarding the future of a select few, promoting nepotism, while neglecting Panthic sentiments. This was evident when SAD functionaries themselves admitted to committing sins and mistakes during their tenure. People are increasingly resentful of the lenient punishments given to those responsible,"" Sakhira added.Meanwhile, Chaura's son, Baljinder Singh Bajwa, said his father had met Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Harjinder Singh Dhami on the day he attempted to assassinate Sukhbir.J S Randhawa, Chaura's counsel, said police have filed a petition that SGPC was not cooperating and had not yet provided CCTV footage.He said the court has sent Chaura to police remand till Dec 14.

Sibal eyes judge's impeachment, seeks PM's support

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday took note of a controversial speech by Allahabad high court judge Shekhar Kumar Yadav, in which he reportedly said the country would function as per the wishes of the ""bahusankhyak (majority)"" and expressed a term used to describe rigid clerics, which is considered pejorative by many. Amid protests that his remarks were unconstitutional and were aimed against the minority community, the apex court also sought a report from HC.The judge made the remarks while speaking on the Uniform Civil Code at a function organised by Vishwa Hindu Parishad on Sunday.As reports of his speech made headlines and a complaint was filed against him in the apex court, the SC administration headed by CJI Sanjiv Khanna sought details about the speech from HC.""SC has taken note of newspaper reports of a speech given by Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav, a sitting judge of HC of judicature at Allahabad. The details and particulars have been called from HC and the matter is under consideration,"" stated a brief statement issued by the apex court.Meanwhile, NGO Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reforms, whose patrons include retired SC judge P B Sawant, filed a complaint with CJI Khanna against the judge, seeking an in-house inquiry and suspension of his judicial work. A strong institutional response is needed as his speech creates doubts about the independence and neutrality of judiciary, it said.Senior advocate and Supreme Court Bar Association president Kapil Sibal appealed for the HC judge's impeachment and sought the support of the PM, home minister and BJP MPs to support the process of impeachment.In his speech, Justice Yadav reportedly said that the children of Hindus are always taught about being kind and non-violent, but such is not the case in the Muslim community. When there is one country and one Constitution, then why should not there be one law for all citizens, he said, supporting UCC.He said many bad practices, which were earlier prevalent among Hindus, such as Sati and female foeticide, have been done away with, and Muslims should also take steps to stop the practice of triple talaq and polygamy.Justice Yadav then said, ""I have no hesitation in saying that this is Hindustan, this country will function as per the wishes of the 'bahusankhyak (majority)' living in Hindustan. This is the law... You cannot say that you are saying this being a high court judge. The law works according to the majority, look at the functioning of family or society, it is the majority which decides.""In its complaint to the CJI, CJAR said, ""Such communally charged statements at a public event, by a sitting judge of HC, not only hurt religious sentiments, but completely erode faith of the general public in the integrity and impartiality of the judicial institution. Such a speech is also a brazen violation of his oath as a judge, where he had promised to uphold the Constitution and its values impartially.""","Allahabad high court judge Shekhar Kumar Yadav reportedly said the country would function as per the wishes of the ""bahusankhyak (majority)"" Yadav made the remarks while speaking on the Uniform Civil Code at a function organised by Vishwa Hindu Parishad.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116190499,imgsize-1008256,width-400,resizemode-4/116190499.jpg"

He in a statement broadcasted on television said that he will continue to be in this role until March 1, 2025.He has called for peace and order in the nation following his appointment. ""Now it is time for this people to enjoy stability and calm,"" said Bashir in an interview.Bashir had earlier served as the head of the rebel administration's ""Salvation Government"" in Syria's Idlib, having previously held the position of ""development minister"".This administration, established in 2017, operated its own ministries, departments, and authorities to support residents disconnected from government services.The engineering graduate in his early forties faces the task of governing a nation fractured by 13 years of conflict from Damascus, the traditional centre of power.Born in 1983 in Idlib province's Jabal al-Zawiya, an area predominantly controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allied groups, Bashir completed his education at Aleppo and Idlib universities, studying engineering and law respectively, and previously worked for Syria's state gas company.Following the rebels' successful offensive beginning November 27, which resulted in the capture of significant territory including Aleppo and the capital, the administration has expanded its support services. However, governing a nation of divided populations presents significantly greater challenges than managing a rebel region of five million people.Various groups are competing for influence in former government strongholds, adding to the complexity of the situation. Abu Mohammed al-Jolani acknowledged to the outgoing prime minister that despite Idlib's limitations, its authorities possess valuable experience, while emphasising the need to retain expertise from the previous administration.Bashir made his first appearance outside Idlib in a video released Monday, dressed formally and meeting with Jolani and the outgoing premier. Radwan Ziadeh, from the Arab Center Washington DC, identified Bashir as closely aligned with Jolani and the rebel command structure, whilst acknowledging the significant challenges ahead.""Just as the revolution was a revolution for all Syrians, the transitional process will be the responsibility of all Syrians in order to ensure it succeeds and guarantees the peaceful transition to democracy,"" he stated.","Mohamed al-Bashir appointed Syria's caretake prime minister. He will continue to be in this role until March 1, 2025. He has called for peace and order in the nation following his appointment.

Israel Strikes Syria: 480 Airstrikes in 48 Hours After Assad’s Fall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-targets-syria-480-strikes-in-48-hours-after-assads-ouster/articleshow/116191385.cms,"Israel has ramped up airstrikes across Syria and carried out significant ground operations, targeting critical military infrastructure in the wake of President Bashar al-Assad's government collapse, according to a war monitor on Tuesday.

The Israeli military announced on Tuesday that it conducted approximately 480 airstrikes over the past 48 hours, targeting key military installations across Syria. This escalation comes days after the removal of President Bashar al-Assad from power.""Within the last 48 hours, the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) struck most of the strategic weapons stockpiles in Syria, preventing them from falling into the hands of terrorist elements,"" the Israeli military said.The strikes reportedly destroyed naval vessels, anti-aircraft systems, and weapons production sites across major cities, including Damascus, Homs, Tartus, Latakia, and Palmyra.According to the IDF, 350 of the strikes involved manned aircraft targeting critical assets such as airfields, drones, missiles, tanks, and fighter jets. The remaining strikes supported ground operations, focusing on weapons depots, launchers, and firing positions. Additionally, Israeli naval forces hit two Syrian naval facilities, destroying 15 docked vessels and sea-to-sea missile stockpiles.The strikes come amidst a broader regional shift, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu describing Assad's ouster as a turning point. “The collapse of the Syrian regime is a direct result of the severe blows with which we have struck Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran,” Netanyahu said during a press conference on Monday. “As I promised, we are changing the face of the Middle East.”Israeli leaders have expressed concern about the uncertainty following Assad’s downfall. While celebrating the removal of an ally of Iran and Hezbollah, officials worry about the potential rise of radical Islamist factions governing Syria.Foreign minister Gideon Sa’ar emphasized the importance of immediate action to safeguard Israel’s security. ""We are targeting military facilities housing chemical weapons and long-range missiles to prevent them from falling into the hands of extremists,"" he said on Monday.","Israel conducted 480 airstrikes over the past 48 hours, targeting key military installations across Syria.

Judge laughed when estranged wife told Bengaluru techie Atul to commit suicide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/judge-laughed-when-estranged-wife-told-bengaluru-techie-atul-to-commit-suicide/articleshow/116234749.cms,"(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: A 34-year-old techie allegedly died by suicide in Bengaluru, prompting his family to seek justice and demand strict action against those they accuse of harassing him. The deceased, Subhash Atul, who worked for a private firm in the city, reportedly left behind a 24-page death note detailing years of alleged emotional distress due to marital discord, multiple legal cases filed against him, and alleged harassment by his wife, her family, and a judge in Uttar Pradesh, police said.Following Subhash's death, authorities registered a case of abetment of suicide against his wife, Nikita Singhania, her mother Nisha, father Anurag, and uncle Sushil, a police official confirmed.Speaking to PTI in Bengaluru, Subhash's brother Bikas stated, ""I want my brother to get justice. I want this country to have a legal process through which even men can get justice. I want strict action against those who are sitting on a legal chair and doing corruption because if this continues then how will people expect justice.""Bikas raised concerns about corruption within the legal system, emphasizing that justice can only be achieved in a system free from corruption, where every party is heard, and arguments are based on facts.""....can expect justice only when decisions are made on the basis of facts and if it does not happen, then people will slowly start losing faith in judicial system. It may lead to a situation where people may get afraid to get married. Men may start feeling that if they get married, they will just end up being an ATM machine for vending money,"" he said.Subhash's body was discovered hanging in his residence at Manjunath Layout, under Marathahalli police station limits, on Monday. In the room where he allegedly died by suicide, police found a placard reading ""Justice is due.""Before taking the extreme step, Subhash recorded an 80-minute video on Rumble, explaining the reasons behind his decision. The video has since gone viral on social media platforms.""I feel that I should kill myself because the money I earn is making my enemies stronger. That same money will be used to destroy me, and this cycle will keep going,"" Subhash is heard saying in the video.Subhash's uncle, Pawan Kumar, claimed his nephew was being harassed and tortured for money, alleging that he was also humiliated by his wife and the judge.""What has happened is very unfortunate. He was losing the case (filed by his wife). He was being tortured. They (wife and family) were constantly demanding money from him. To the best of his capacity, he was giving her money for child maintenance,"" Kumar said.According to Kumar, the family initially demanded Rs 40,000 per month, which was later doubled. Eventually, they asked for Rs 1 lakh.He accused Subhash's wife and her family of ""minting"" money under the guise of child maintenance for their four-year-old son, questioning how much money was genuinely needed to raise a child of that age.""His wife even said that he should commit suicide if he cannot pay the amount to which the judge also laughed. This really hurt him,"" Kumar alleged.Kumar revealed that Subhash had been grappling with suicidal thoughts for the past six months, but his family had no idea he might take such a drastic step. ""He had made a timetable for everything,"" Kumar said.Subhash's cousin, Bajrang Agarwal, alleged that his wife and her family constantly demanded money from him. ""Till the time he was giving money, things were fine. When he stopped paying exorbitant amounts as per their demands, the dispute started again and she started living separately with the child. Divorce case was going on. They filed so many cases against him that he broke down and he ended his life,"" Agarwal told PTI in Samastipur.Agarwal demanded that those responsible for Subhash's harassment be punished to ensure his soul finds peace.In response to the allegations, Nikita's uncle, Sushil Kumar, declared his innocence and claimed that neither he nor his family was present at the scene of the incident.""I came to know that I am also named in the FIR. I am innocent. I wasn't even there. We got to know about his suicide through media. None of our family members were present at the scene of incident. There's a case going on in the court for the last three years and in this duration, we did not have any communication with him or his family. We are not at fault. Case is going on... Court will decide and give the verdict,"" Sushil told PTI in Jaunpur.He also denied the allegations made by Subhash, stating that Nikita would soon address them.Meanwhile, a police team investigating the case has reached Uttar Pradesh to question Subhash's wife and her family members. ""We are looking into all the allegations and the matter is being investigated from all angles,"" said a senior police officer.Preliminary investigations by police revealed that Subhash had been experiencing marital discord with his wife, who had also filed a case against him in Uttar Pradesh. Before his death, he emailed the 24-page death note to several people and shared it in a WhatsApp group linked to an NGO he was associated with, according to the officer.The death note reportedly mentions that Subhash got married in 2019 and that the couple had a son the following year.","Techie Subhash Atul, 34, allegedly died by suicide in Bengaluru on Monday.

Syria's new prime minister , Mohammad al-Bashir , has pledged to protect minority rights following the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad . He also called on Syrian refugees to return home, according to an interview published Wednesday in Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.Bashir, appointed Tuesday as transitional head of government until March 1, leads a country facing significant challenges after nearly 14 years of war. He told Corriere della Sera, ""Precisely because we are Islamic, we will guarantee the rights of all people and all sects in Syria.""Syria's war has displaced half the population, with six million seeking refuge abroad. Bashir urged their return, saying, ""Syria is now a free country that has earned its pride and dignity. Come back."" Damascus's main airport is expected to reopen soon.Bashir also expressed willingness to collaborate with anyone who doesn't support Assad.The new leadership also claims that they aim to reassure minorities they won't face similar treatment while promising justice for victims of Assad's regime. HTS leader, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, now using his real name Ahmed al-Sharaa stated, ""We will not pardon those involved in torturing detainees."" He urged countries to extradite any officials who fled Syria to face justice. In Damascus hospitals, families searched for missing loved ones, seeking closure after years of uncertainty.The appointment marks a transition for Syria after decades under the Assad family. The Islamist-led alliance, spearheaded by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), rapidly defeated Assad's forces, ending five decades of family rule.Celebrations erupted across Syria and internationally. Soon after it was revealed that Assad govenrment was overthrown, people thronged the streets to celebrate the fall of a regime that had ruled the country with an iron fist for decades. Many in Damascus and elsewhere in Syria poured onto the streets dancing and chanting slogans like ""freedom"", ""its over"", ""Assad is gone,"" and ""Long live Syria and down with Bashar al-Assad"". People also gathered to celebrate in the central squares of Damascus, chanting anti-Assad slogans and honking car horns.However, in Aleppo, residents expressed mixed feelings. While some expressed a sense of emerging safety, others voiced concerns about daily life uncertainties and rising prices.In Assad's ancestral village, his father's tomb was burned. The Baath party announced a suspension of activities and the handover of assets.The international reactions also vary. The UN urged an inclusive transition, while its Secretary-General expressed support for a smooth power transfer. Russia called for Syrian stabilization and criticized Israeli airstrikes targeting Assad's military sites. Germany and other countries cautioned against foreign military intervention.Qatar plans to reopen its Damascus embassy. Former US ambassador to Syria, Robert Ford, suggested testing Jolani's promises, including international monitoring of any discovered chemical weapons.The rebel offensive began on November 27, coinciding with a ceasefire in the Israel-Hezbollah war.","Mohammad al-Bashir, appointed Tuesday as transitional head of government until March 1.

Bin Laden, Tehran and the Taliban



'Murdered my dreams'



PARACHINAR: Once again, Ali Ghulam receives mourners at his home -- his brother and nephew killed 40 years apart in the same sectarian conflict that was reignited this year in northwest Pakistan, claiming 200 lives since July alone.Thousands of residents are stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district, which borders Afghanistan, as the government struggles to end clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stemming from decades-old tensions over farmland.""Our generations yearn for peace,"" 72-year-old Ghulam told AFP at his home in Parachinar, the main town and a Shiite bastion of the restive district.The latest flare-up of violence has ""reopened wounds"" he said, recalling how his brother was killed in an attack in 1987 that also wounded another three of his brothers.Kurram, known as the ""Parrot's Beak"" for its protrusion into neighbouring Afghanistan, is bounded by dizzyingly high mountains, the northern flank of which includes the Tora Bora caves where Al Qaeda founder and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden once hid.Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for various militant groups, with militants and weapons able to flow largely unchecked in and out of Afghanistan.""I have never experienced peace in my life and have no hope my coming generations will live free of fear,"" Ghulam said.Tribal and family feuds are common in Pakistan.But they can be particularly protracted and violent in the mountainous tribal northwest, where communities live by traditional codes of honour and revenge.The latest round of violence in Kurram erupted in May and intensified in July, when gunmen opened fire on a council of elders attempting to settle the latest round of disagreements over land.Various truces announced since then have held for only weeks or days at a time.More than 300 shops and over 200 homes in Sunni areas have been destroyed, often by fire, and hundreds of families have fled.Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country with Shiites making up 10 to 15 percent of the population, or at least 25 million people.Members of the two sects have periodically clashed in Kurram, where Shiites are particularly vulnerable as they must pass through Sunni-majority neighbourhoods to access essential services.Kurram's location on the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan put it at the heart of the religious and political upheavals of the last five decades.In 1979, Shiites led a revolution in Iran and later that year the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, prompting Sunni hardliners there to rise up against them.Pakistan's military ruler Zia-ul-Haq aligned with them, funnelling thousands of Sunni militants into Afghanistan through Kurram.""It became a hub for arms supply to Afghanistan, including landmines, mortar shells, and weapons of all kinds. Every household in Kurram had a stockpile of weapons,"" Malik Attaullah Khan, a local tribal elder told AFP.Khan, who signed a 2007 agreement aimed at bringing peace to Kurram, criticised the government for failing to ""fulfil in its responsibilities"" in enforcing land settlements.The ethnic Pashtun heartland was merged into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in 2018, but the Pakistani state maintains limited control in the merged districts.In rural areas of Pakistan, villages often bypass the formal justice system and men-only ""jirgas"" or councils made up of respected village elders resolve disputes, sometimes in the form of fines or land reallocation.Ghulam's nephew was killed along with at least 42 others last month, when Sunni gunmen opened fire on a convoy of Shiites being escorted by the police to their homes.In retaliation, a market in a Sunni-dominated area was set on fire.Syed Ghani Shah told AFP his cousin was burned to death inside his shop.""When we buried him, he was so unrecognisable that we couldn't even let his parents see his face,"" Shah said.""Can we ever make peace after all this? Never, if we ever get the chance, we will surely avenge our blood,"" he warned.Authorities have enforced curfews and road closures to reduce the chances of violence breaking out, providing escorts through high-risk areas and using helicopters to deliver supplies.But Akbar Khan, a representative of Pakistan's independent Human Rights Commission told AFP that the state needs to do more to resolve the issue.""In the past, jirgas were successful because they had the full support of the state. Now, the authorities don't even provide the expenses needed to hold a jirga,"" he said.Fatima Ahmed's husband was killed last month while travelling to Islamabad to arrange her admission to medical college.""I don't want to live a life without him. I've lost my will to exist,"" the 21-year-old told AFP.""They haven't just martyred my husband -- they've also murdered my dreams with him,"" she said, bursting into tears.",Violence in northwest Pakistan has killed 200 people since July. Clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stem from decades-old tensions over farmland. Residents stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district.

Drones in New Jersey: What Homeland Security said about mysterious sightings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/drones-in-new-jersey-what-homeland-security-said-about-mysterious-sightings/articleshow/116232357.cms,"Drones in New Jersey

Mystery Drones Spotted Over Trump's Golf Course, U.S. Military Research Site In New Jersey

The mysterious drones spotted across New Jersey recently seem to evade conventional tracking techniques, including helicopter surveillance and radio monitoring, according to information shared by US state lawmaker briefed Wednesday by the Department of Homeland Security .The New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, along with the NJ State Police, provided a briefing regarding the recent reports of drones flying in the state. Local government officials including mayors and state legislators received updates from federal authorities regarding current intelligence about the unexpected drone sightings and the potential operators responsible for these aerial activities.Additionally, based on the distributed DHS document shared by Montvale's Mayor Mike Ghassali during the meeting, the identity of those controlling the drones is still unknown. The handout contained a direct FBI statement, ""At this time, according to the FBI, there are no known specific or credible threats related to these sightings,"" as quoted by ABC News.Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was also part of the briefing, shared on X that these drones measure up to 6 feet across and operate without lights. The Morris County Republican participated in discussions with state police and Homeland Security officials regarding sightings spanning from New York City through New Jersey into Pennsylvania, including Philadelphia. Fantasia also indicated these devices appear to be operated by entities other than hobbyists.Erik Peterson, a Republican Assembly man representing areas where drone sightings occurred, also participated in the 90-minute meeting at a West Trenton state police facility. He claimed that while Department of Homeland Security officials were accommodating during the discussion, they seemed to downplay certain worries, noting that not every reported sighting had been verified as an actual drone incident. Talking about Homeland Security's understanding of the identity, origin, and purpose of these aerial objects, Peterson said, ""My understanding is they have no clue.""The nocturnal flights, which began last month, have sparked concerns, particularly due to their proximity to sensitive locations like the Picatinny Arsenal and President-elect Donald Trump's Bedminster golf course. Whilst drone operation is permitted in New Jersey for both leisure and business purposes, operators must comply with local regulations, FAA guidelines and obtain proper certification.The observed drones typically exceed the dimensions of standard hobby models.Officials note that whilst sighting reports have increased, some observations may actually be aircraft rather than drones, with possible duplicate reports of the same drone.The FBI is investigating and has asked the public to submit any photos, videos, or information related to the sightings. The Coast Guard confirmed observing multiple low-altitude aircraft near one of their vessels near Island Beach State Park but stated they weren’t perceived as an immediate threat. They are assisting the FBI and state agencies in the investigation.Despite calls from some officials for military intervention, the Pentagon has stated its initial assessment is that these drones are not from a foreign adversary. Governor Phil Murphy and law enforcement officials have emphasized that the drones do not appear to pose an immediate threat to public safety. However, the ongoing mystery has prompted calls for stricter drone regulations .Meanwhile, US Representatives Chris Smith and Jeff Van Drew advocate military intervention to neutralise the drones. Smith referenced a Coast Guard report of multiple drones pursuing a lifeboat near Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park. Additionally, Smith's letter to Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin requested military assistance, citing Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst's drone countermeasure capabilities.Coast Guard Lt. Luke Pinneo confirmed ""multiple low-altitude aircraft were observed in vicinity of one of our vessels near Island Beach State Park."" The aircraft posed no immediate threat or operational disruption, according to Pinneo. The Coast Guard supports the ongoing FBI and state investigation.Governor Phil Murphy and law enforcement officials have emphasized that the drones do not appear to pose an immediate threat to public safety. He acknowledged public concerns earlier this week.In the meantime, as a precautionary measure, local legislators advocate stricter drone operation regulations, with one proposing a temporary statewide ban.Assemblyman Erik Peterson, representing affected areas, attended a 90-minute West Trenton meeting over the drone concerns. He noted that whilst DHS officials were accommodating, they appeared to downplay certain concerns, indicating not all reported sightings were confirmed drone activity. The identity, origin, and purpose of these objects remain unclear, according to Peterson.","Mystery drones spotted across New Jersey recently seem to evade conventional tracking techniques, including helicopter surveillance and radio monitoring.

FBI Director Christopher Wray to resign to make way for Kash Patel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fbi-director-christopher-wray-to-resign-to-make-way-for-kash-patel/articleshow/116226101.cms,"Christopher Wray sai he intends to resign at the end of Biden's term.

FBI Director Christopher Wray is expected to resign before his term ends making way for Donald Trump's FBI pick Kash Patel . Fox News Wednesday reported that the announcement can come any moment before the Donald Trump administration takes over in January.

I love this place, I love our mission, and I love our people — but my focus is, and always has been, on us and doing what’s right for the FBI,” he added.“What absolutely cannot, must not change is our commitment to doing the right thing, the right way, every time,” Wray also said. “Our adherence to our core values, our dedication to independence and objectivity, and our defense of the rule of law — those fundamental aspects of who we are must never change.Trump and his hardline allies turned on Wray, and the FBI more generally, after agents conducted a court-approved search of Trump’s Florida resort in 2022 to recover classified documents that he had retained after leaving office.",FBI Director Christopher Wray is expected to resign before his term ends making way for Donald Trump's FBI pick Kash Patel. Fox News reported that the announcement can come any moment before the Donald Trump administration takes over in January.

How Donald Trump sent his son's 'ex-fiancée' Kimberly Guilfoyle to Greece as Bettina Anderson sparks love triangle gossip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-donald-trump-sent-his-sons-ex-fiance-kimberly-guilfoyle-to-greece-as-bettina-anderson-sparks-love-triangle-gossip/articleshow/116203694.cms,"Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle

US President-elect Donald Trump made a flurry of job announcements on Wednesday, including the selection of Kimberly Guilfoyle as ambassador to Greece . However, the timing of this appointment was anything but ordinary, coming amid a storm of tabloid gossip surrounding his son Donald Trump Jr 's relationship status.Guilfoyle, who had been dating Trump Jr since 2018 and got engaged to him in 2020, found herself in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. The day earlier, British tabloid The Daily Mail published photos of Trump Jr with socialite Bettina Anderson , igniting rumors that he had moved on with a new love interest.The outlet described the images as ""incontrovertible proof"" that Trump Jr had ""moved on"" with the ""stunning 'it girl.'""And so, as his son’s rumored new romance heated up, Donald Trump reportedly sent his son’s 'ex-fiancée' to Greece. The timing of Guilfoyle’s appointment as ambassador could hardly be more dramatic, adding layers to the gossip surrounding the love triangle.Despite the swirling rumors, Guilfoyle’s appointment was met with a glowing endorsement from Trump, who called her ""a close friend and ally"" with “extensive experience and leadership.” However, his Truth Social post made no mention of her relationship with his son, nor did it address the tabloid storm brewing around her and Trump Jr’s alleged breakup.The whispers about the love triangle have been brewing for months.As per the report by NYT, in July, Anderson raised eyebrows at the Republican National Convention , where she sat conspicuously close to Trump Jr and Guilfoyle, clad in a striking red dress. And just last September, reports surfaced of Trump Jr and Anderson sharing a kiss during brunch — adding fuel to the speculation, especially since Anderson was once friends with Trump Jr’s ex-wife, Vanessa Trump.Further intrigue followed when Guilfoyle was notably absent from a postelection family photo, which featured Vanessa, her five children with Trump Jr, and even Elon Musk. The missing fiancée fueled chatter about the couple’s relationship status.Meanwhile, Anderson stirred the pot this week with an Instagram post showcasing a lavish bouquet and a note reading, ""Many have said that you're aging out but I think you're perfect."" Her caption? ""Tough but fair."" Observers were quick to spot Trump Jr's Instagram handle tagged in the post.Anderson, who hails from a prominent Palm Beach family and leads a conservation nonprofit, poked fun at her public image, describing herself online as a “typical stay-at-home mom” who “doesn’t do household chores … or have a husband … or have kids,” reported NYT.When asked about the love triangle rumors , a spokesperson for President-elect Trump dismissed them as “very sexist,” emphasizing that Guilfoyle’s selection was based on her qualifications.Guilfoyle herself shared her excitement about the role, saying she looks forward to “delivering on the Trump agenda, supporting our Greek allies, and ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity.”Trump Jr also chimed in, saying he was “so proud of Kimberly” and confident she would “be an amazing leader.” Whether he’ll join her in Greece remains unanswered, leaving the tabloids to speculate further.For now, all eyes are on Guilfoyle as she steps onto the global stage, carrying both her new diplomatic role and the weight of swirling headlines.","Kimberly Guilfoyle was named ambassador to Greece on Wednesday.

What is the Luigi Mangione '286 Conspiracy Theory'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-luigi-mangione-286-conspiracy-theory/articleshow/116176938.cms,"The Case: The Murder of Brian Thompson



Details of the Crime



Mangione’s Arrest



Key Connections to the Number 286







Timeline of Events



The ""286 conspiracy theory"" centers on the alleged connections between Luigi Mangione—a suspect in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson—and the number 286. Internet sleuths have identified several supposed links between this number and various aspects of Mangione’s life, actions, and the murder, fueling speculation about deeper meanings or intentions.On December 7, 2024, Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was fatally shot outside a Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan. Surveillance footage captured a masked gunman fleeing the scene, described by witnesses as wearing dark clothing and carrying a concealed weapon. The attack occurred at approximately 9:15 PM as Thompson exited a private dinner event. The gunman fired multiple shots, striking Thompson in the chest and abdomen. Despite immediate emergency response, Thompson was pronounced dead upon arrival at a nearby hospital.Thompson was a significant figure in the corporate healthcare industry, known for leading cost-cutting measures and streamlining insurance policies. While these efforts were celebrated by some in the corporate world, they also attracted criticism from activists and patients who felt neglected by the healthcare system.The weapon used in the murder was a ghost gun, an untraceable firearm assembled from unregulated parts. This type of weapon, favored by those seeking to avoid detection, was later discovered among Mangione’s possessions. Witness accounts and surveillance footage showed the suspect fleeing north on foot in a calculated manner, leading authorities to believe the crime was premeditated. Investigators connected Mangione to the murder using ballistic evidence, digital footprints, and his documented animosity toward the corporate healthcare sector.Two days after the murder, on December 9, 2024, Mangione was arrested at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He was found in possession of a ghost gun similar to the one used in the murder, a three-page handwritten manifesto detailing his grievances against corporate America, and forged identification documents. Investigators determined that Mangione had fled Manhattan immediately after the crime, using cash and burner phones to evade capture.The number 286 has emerged as a recurring element in the investigation, with internet sleuths drawing various connections. One notable link is the Pokémon Breloom, which holds the Pokédex number 286. This Pokémon featured prominently in Mangione’s X (formerly Twitter) account banner, leading some to speculate that it was chosen intentionally.Some have tied the number to Proverbs 28:6, a Bible verse stating, “Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity than a rich man who is crooked in his ways.” This verse has been interpreted as reflective of Mangione’s disdain for corporate greed and figures like Thompson. Furthermore, in healthcare billing, denial code 286 refers to claims denied due to failure to meet appeal deadlines—a symbolic connection given Mangione’s documented criticism of the healthcare system.On December 7, 2024, Brian Thompson was fatally shot outside the Hilton hotel in Manhattan. Surveillance footage captured the gunman fleeing the scene. The following day, police identified Mangione as a person of interest based on digital evidence and previous anti-corporate statements. On December 9, Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where he was charged with weapons possession and forgery. Authorities began preparing murder charges based on ballistic evidence and Mangione’s manifesto. On December 10, Mangione appeared in court, and prosecutors revealed his potential motivations and ties to the healthcare industry.The Luigi Mangione ""286 conspiracy theory"" hinges on the idea that a single number ties together various elements of a murder case, reflecting either deliberate symbolism or an unusual string of coincidences. While the significance of 286 remains speculative, the case has captivated public interest, demonstrating how patterns—real or imagined—can influence the narratives of high-profile investigations.","The ""286 conspiracy theory"" centers on the alleged connections between Luigi Mangione and the number 286.

The beginning of a contentious relationship

Escalating tensions

The final decision

FBI Director Christopher Wray 's resignation, announced just as Donald Trump prepares to take office again, is the culmination of a tumultuous relationship marked by intense political pressure and public feuding. Wray's tenure, which began under Trump's administration in 2017, has been characterized by a series of conflicts that ultimately led to his decision to step down at the end of Biden's term.The backdrop to Wray's resignation is a series of events that have strained his relationship with Trump. Trump's dissatisfaction with Wray reportedly culminated in his recent nomination of Kash Patel , a staunch Trump ally, as Wray's successor.Key events leading up to Wray's resignation include:Trump nominates Wray after firing James Comey amid investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election.The FBI conducts a search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate for classified documents, intensifying Trump's criticism of Wray and the agency.Trump wins re-election and announces Patel as his choice for FBI director.Wray announces his resignation, clearing the way for Patel to take over 789.In response to Wray's resignation, Trump celebrated on social media, calling it ""a great day for America"" and claiming it would end what he termed the ""Weaponization"" of the Justice Department. Meanwhile, Attorney General Merrick Garland praised Wray for his honorable service during a challenging period.Wray was appointed by Trump following the controversial firing of FBI Director James Comey, who had been overseeing investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Initially praised by Trump as a ""model of integrity,"" Wray’s position quickly became precarious as investigations into Trump's conduct began to unfold. In December 2017, Wray defended the FBI against Trump's accusations that the agency was biased and had a tarnished reputation, saying, ""The FBI I see are tens of thousands of men and women who are hard-charging people of integrity"".As Trump's presidency progressed, tensions escalated significantly. The FBI's investigation into Russian interference and subsequent inquiries into Trump's actions during and after the 2020 election led to increasing criticism from the former president, as reported by US Today. In August 2022, the FBI's search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate for classified documents provoked a furious backlash from Trump, who labeled it an example of ""weaponization"" against him. He claimed that Wray had presided over an agency that was part of a ""Deep State"" conspiracy aimed at undermining his presidency.By late 2024, as Trump prepared for a return to the White House following his electoral victory, he had already nominated Kash Patel—a staunch ally and vocal critic of Wray—as his successor. This nomination signaled Trump's intent to replace Wray upon taking office, further intensifying the pressure on the FBI director, as reported by US Today.Wray's announcement on December 11, 2024, that he would resign at the end of Biden's term was framed as a strategic move to keep the FBI focused on its mission without becoming embroiled in political controversies. ""After weeks of thoughtful consideration,"" Wray said, ""I believe the best course for the Bureau is for me to fulfill my duties until the end of the administration... while avoiding dragging the Bureau deeper into the fray"".Trump responded swiftly to Wray's resignation, declaring it ""a great day for America,"" asserting that it would help end what he described as the ""Weaponization"" of the Justice Department 25. This culmination of years-long tensions reflects not only personal animosity but also broader political dynamics that have increasingly politicized law enforcement agencies in America.","FBI Director Christopher Wray announced his resignation on December 11, 2024.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges, including engaging in political activities and violating a law on official secrets, during field general court martial (FGCM) proceedings against him, military's media affairs wing said Tuesday.Army's media arm ISPR said FGCM also charged Hameed with compromising state security and interests, abusing authority and resources and causing undue harm to individuals. ISPR said proceedings against Hameed were initiated on Aug 12 under provisions of Pakistan Army Act.Hameed, who served as ISI director-general from June 2019 to Oct 2021, was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. He was arrested over accusations about his involvement in land grabbing and snatching valuables and property from the owner of a private housing society. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable in a country where powerful generals have long wielded unparalleled influence in state affairs.""During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (Retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading up to multiple incidents including but not limited to the May 9, 2023 incident for fomenting instability, at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,"" ISPR said. The May 9 incident referred to countrywide protests when PTI supporters stormed army installations and govt buildings following the arrest of party chief and ex-PM Imran Khan for alleged graft. To many, Hameed's close association with Khan was the reason behind his arrest. Khan wanted to continue with Hameed as ISI head but then army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had been adamant on replacing him. Bajwa eventually succeeded and Khan could serve only a few months in office; he was later removed through a no-confidence.Independent observers say action against Hameed could put Khan under pressure and pave the way for the ex-PM to face a military court on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military.","Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries. According to the data, he has been booked in 99 cases in Punjab, 76 in Islamabad and two in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.",Imran Khan has asked his supporters to converge in Peshawar on Dec 13.

Growing threat from Baloch separatists

Sectarian violence fuels instability

Border tensions and counterterrorism efforts

What lies ahead

Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month, according to a report by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). The number of fatalities also surged by 69%, climbing from 100 in October to 169, with 225 others injured.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a banned group, carried out 12 attacks in November, including three high-impact incidents that resulted in 45 deaths. These figures surpassed the fatalities caused by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), indicating a shift in the BLA's operational strategy. Experts suggest this escalation requires a reassessment of counterterrorism tactics.The majority of these attacks in Balochistan targeted security forces and civilians. Notable incidents included an assault on the Quetta railway station, an attack on a police van in Mastung, and a strike on a security check-post in Kalat, which collectively accounted for 91% of the province’s fatalities.Sectarian violence added another layer to the country's security challenges, particularly in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Seven incidents, including two terror attacks and five sectarian clashes, claimed 115 lives and left 137 injured. The violence was triggered by an attack on passenger buses on November 21, which spiraled into broader sectarian unrest.KP remained the most affected province, with 41 terrorist attacks leading to 114 deaths and 95 injuries. The TTP, Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-i-Islam, and other local factions were linked to most of these incidents.The report also highlighted six incidents of border violence along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, resulting in 25 terrorist deaths and 11 injuries. This underscores the ongoing instability in the region and the challenges posed by cross-border insurgents.Security forces conducted 19 counterterrorism operations in November, killing 53 terrorists. Most of these operations were concentrated in KP and Balochistan, the epicenters of recent violence.The PIPS report paints a grim picture of Pakistan's security landscape, with 98 conflict-related incidents causing 338 deaths and 411 injuries in November alone. Experts suggest that the evolving nature of terror threats, including the increasing lethality of BLA operations and persistent sectarian tensions, requires urgent and innovative policy responses.As Pakistan grapples with these challenges, the question remains: can the state adapt quickly enough to address the multifaceted threats destabilizing the country?","Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month.
