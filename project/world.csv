FBI’s Kash Patel Stumbles After Charlie Kirk’s Assassination; ‘Botched’ Updates Trigger Backlash

Who is Andrew Bailey? 'I am not...'



Kash Patel's series of wrong moves in the Charlie Kirk incident



Patel announced that the suspect was in custody hours after Charlie Kirk was shot. Then he took back his statement and said the suspect was released. They actually got a wrong person. A day later, Patel flew from New York to Utah to join a press conference where he was seen with an FBI jacket like a field agent. It was called unprecedented for the FBI director. Despite his presence, which delayed the Thursday press conference, Patel did not speak as the suspect was not identified. Patel was present at the press conference where they announced the arrest of Tyler Robinson, but Utah Governor Spencer Cox spoke about the details of how he was caught, not Patel.





Amid speculations that Kash Patel should be removed as the FBI director, insider chatter claims that former Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who will be sworn in as a new deputy director of the FBI in a power-sharing role with Dan Bongino, will eventually replace Patel. Patel is believed to be on thin ice, though President Donald Trump praised his leadership and the FBI's investigation into the assassination of Charlie Kirk.Inside reports claim Trump is not thrilled with Patel, and the wrong arrest in connection with the Charlie Kirk murder was not the only reason. Patel's fallout with Pam Bondi over the Epstein case is where it all began. The White House, Bondi and her deputy, Todd Blanche, have no confidence in Kash Patel and Pam Bondi, in particular, cannot stand Patel, Fox reported, citing a source.Andrew Bailey was reportedly Trump's original choice to lead the FBI. As he will be sworn in today as the co-deputy director, there is speculation that he is a part of a broader plan that will place him in the position of Patel. Bailey issued a statement to Fox clarifying that he is not replacing Patel. ""Any suggestion that I was brought in to replace anyone in leadership at the FBI or spin my appointment into a sign of division, is simply false - I am honored to serve the FBI and Department of Justice as we work together to keep our nation safe,"" he said.Meanwhile in a separate but related development Kash Patel on Monday revealed a key development in the investigation into the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Patel said the agency has recovered a “text thread” in which the alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson, wrote that he had the chance to kill Kirk and planned to act out of “hatred that cannot be negotiated with.”","Andrew Bailey will be sworn in as co-deputy director of the FBI today.

NEW DELHI: Close on the heels of his two-day tour of the North-East last week, PM Narendra Modi appears to be preparing for another tour of the region. He is likely to visit Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh later this month, his back-to-back trips, which hardly featured on the travel plans of his predecessors, being another instance that demonstrates his relentless travel zeal, which he has shown since his days as an RSS pracharak, has not dimmed with age or changes in role.These excursions have provided opportunities for him to disseminate his messages, expedite the implementation of schemes, and gather feedback.On Wednesday, he will mark his 75th birthday in MP, launching welfare schemes, in keeping with his plank of inclusive development.Modi's journeys have been an integral part of his politics. In 1990, he helped organise the Somnath-Ayodhya Rath Yatra, igniting pride amongst Hindus that laid the foundations for BJP to emerge at the national level.The Ekta Yatra (1991-92), which he led along with former BJP chief MM Joshi, and which culminated in hoisting the national flag at Srinagar's Lal Chowk, symbolised defiance of terrorism.As Gujarat CM, Modi's Gujarat Gaurav Yatra (2002) restored hope after a devastating earthquake, while the Swarnim Gujarat Yatra (2010) celebrated the state's progress. ""Each journey was a bridge to the people, rooted in their aspirations,"" said BJP national media head Anil Baluni.""From his days as an RSS pracharak to his role as India's PM, Modi's travels have always been about more than speeches. They are about meeting people where they are, listening to their dreams, and turning their stories into national pride,"" the BJP functionary said.The effort has been supplemented by his monthly radio address, ' Mann Ki Baat ', an innovation that he has skillfully used to weave individual feats into his larger message of Viksit Bharat.Whether celebrating a tribal woman reviving Santhali handlooms in Odisha or cheering at Pulwama's first night cricket match, the PM has been actively involved in celebrating such achievements.The Covid pandemic saw him utilise addresses and app-based outreach to transform a public health crisis into a mass movement, fostering unity.His words during security crises, like ""ghar mein ghus ke marenge"", have been the vehicles of signaling collective resolve and rally spirits during crises. He stood in solidarity with K Sivan and other Isro scientists when the Chandrayaan-2 mission failed, and has been playing the understanding patriarch-cum-counsellor to anxiety-filled students during his 'Pariksha Pe Charcha'.","PM Narendra Modi appears to be preparing for another tour of the North-East.

Chhewang to front Ladakh talks as Wangchuk’s fast deepens divide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chhewang-to-front-ladakh-talks-as-wangchuks-fast-deepens-divide/articleshow/123929206.cms,"SRINAGAR: Former MP Thupstan Chhewang will head a Buddhist delegation in talks with Union govt on Ladakh’s demand for Sixth Schedule status and statehood after climate activist Sonam Wangchuk pressed on with his hunger strike.Leh Apex Body (LAB) announced Tuesday that all political parties will step aside, leaving religious representatives led by Chhewang to head the talks. Chhewang resigned as LAB chairman on July 5 and was succeeded by Wangchuk two days later, fueling speculation he would front the talks.Wangchuk began a 35-day fast on Sept 9, accusing Centre of stalling dialogue “on restoring Ladakh’s democratic rights”.Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, crafted for tribal areas in the Northeast, grants special protections over land, culture, and resources through autonomous councils. Since the 2019 bifurcation of J&K into two Union territories, Ladakhis have demanded similar safeguards, warning of demographic and industrial pressures.Union home ministry set up a high-powered panel in Jan 2023 following prolonged protests. Its last meeting with LAB and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA) on May 27 yielded a domicile policy but no progress since.Kargil Autonomous Hill Development Council chairman M Jaffar Akhoon urged Wangchuk to call off his strike.“Whatever we are to achieve, it has to come from govt, be it statehood, Sixth Schedule, or any other benefit. These issues will be decided at the talks. If you go on a hunger strike before dialogue even begins, it will not be a good move,” Akhoon said.BJP functionaries also appealed for an end to the fast, warning that “outside activists with radical views” had joined the protest. The party also blamed LAB’s internal rifts for stalled talks, alleging Chhewang was sidelined.Wangchuk has linked his protest to Leh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) elections due in Oct — calling it a test of BJP’s credibility. “In the previous elections, the party listed Sixth Schedule for Ladakh as its first priority in its manifesto. But now, after five years, they want to bury that point,” he had said.BJP swept the 2020 LAHDC-Leh polls, winning 15 of 26 seats. The council was created in 1995 under then PM PV Narasimha Rao, with a parallel body for Kargil set up in 2003 by then J&K CM Mufti Mohammad Sayeed.","Former MP Thupstan Chhewang will head a Buddhist delegation in talks with Union govt on Ladakh’s demand for Sixth Schedule status and statehood.

Political tempers rise in Kashmir over highway closure; netas allege conspiracy to choke Valley’s economy as fruit-landed trucks stranded,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/political-tempers-rise-in-kashmir-over-highway-closure-netas-allege-conspiracy-to-choke-valleys-economy-as-fruit-landed-trucks-stranded/articleshow/123928245.cms,"SRINAGAR: As Jammu-Srinagar national highway, a lifeline for Kashmir, has remained closed to heavy traffic for the past 20 days, leaving thousands of fruit-laden trucks stranded, both the Centre and the Omar Abdullah govt have come under fire from political parties in J&K.Although the highway was partially reopened on Tuesday, with authorities permitting one-way traffic from Jammu to Srinagar, videos of distressed truckers stranded on the roads have sparked fury in Kashmir Valley. Some politicians alleged the prolonged NH closure in the peak fruit harvest season was part of a conspiracy to hit Kashmir’s economy.PDP’s Iltija Mufti met LG Manoj Sinha on Tuesday and sought his intervention to expedite the highway repair work. She also appealed for an interim package for fruit growers.While PDP and some other parties blamed Omar govt for the crisis that fruit growers in the Valley are facing due to the NH closure, the CM had on Monday expressed displeasure with NHAI’s failure to restore the road in 20 days.A cornered Omar has held several meetings since Monday, seeking a solution to the crisis. At his initiative, Union minister for road, transport and highways Nitin Gadkari convened a meeting on Tuesday to review the restoration of the highway.“The meeting deliberated on immediate steps required to fully restore NH-44 for the urgent movement of fruit-laden trucks and uninterrupted supply of essentials,” said the CM, who joined through virtual mode.The highway had suffered major damage in several stretches, particularly in Udhampur, after heavy rains on Aug 26-27, which triggered flash floods and landslides. The restoration work is still ongoing.On Tuesday, authorities permitted traffic movement from Jammu to Srinagar, while trucks carrying essential commodities were allowed from Udhampur to Kashmir Valley, bringing some relief to people facing shortage of essentials. However, no vehicle movement from Srinagar towards Jammu was allowed.This prompted Srinagar MP Aga Ruhullah Mehdi of governing NC to allege it was a deliberate attack on Kashmir’s economy. Horticulture and agriculture contributed 75% to Kashmir’s GDP, and allowing fruits worth crores to rot in stranded trucks was intended at making the Valley’s economy dysfunctional, he alleged.Awami Ittehad Party, too, alleged that Kashmir’s economy was being deliberately choked, and staged a protest.Peoples Conference chief and Handwara MLA Sajad Lone urged Omar to travel to Delhi and ensure expeditious clearance of the highway.CPM legislator M Y Tarigami and Congress J&K president Tariq Hamid Karra blamed the Centre for the crisis. Karra described the widening of Jammu-Srinagar highway as a “failed project”, alleging that the Union govt’s approach of blasting the mountains to widen the roads lacked scientific basis and was responsible for the widespread destruction in the Himalayan states, with nature taking its revenge.Jammu Chamber of Commerce and Industries president Arun Gupta, too, wrote to Gadkari, urging that concrete steps be taken to make the highway fully operational at the earliest.","Jammu-Srinagar national highway has remained closed to heavy traffic for the past 20 days, leaving thousands of fruit-laden trucks stranded.

""Incidentally, when the ceasefire offer came through Rubio to me on May 10... I was told that there would be a dialogue between Pakistan and India at an independent place... When we met on July 25 during a bilateral meeting with Rubio in Washington, I asked him 'What happened to those dialogues?'

India has categorically denied that there was any third-party intervention, stating that the ceasefire was achieved through direct talks between Directors General of Military Operations of the two nations.The Pakistani foreign minister also stressed Islamabad's willingness to engage in talks, but added that Pakistan refused to ""beg"" for an engagement with India. ""It takes two to tango,"" he said.""We don't mind, but India has categorically been stating it's bilateral. We don't mind bilateral.

FBI Uncovers SHOCKING DNA Proof Against Charlie Kirk Assassin Tyler Robinson; Chilling Note Exposed

DNA match, new evidence in the Charlie Kirk assassination case







Tyler Robinson has not confessed to his crime of shooting Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University to the police but he reportedly admitted it at a group chat, The Washington Post reported. “Hey guys, I have bad news for you all. It was me at UVU yesterday. im sorry for all of this,” Tyler apparently posted on Discord, the report said. The message was sent from Robinson's account to a small group of online friend Thursday night, about two hours before he was taken into custody.Discord also provided a copy of the message to authorities and told the Post that it is providing the FBI and local authorities with information about Robinson’s online activities to help their investigation.Tyler Robinson is currently being held at the Utah County Jail on special watch to determine whether he is a risk to himself or others. He is set to appear virtually for his first court appearance on Tuesday. FBI director Kash Patel made some revelations about the investigation and said FBI found a screwdriver on the rooftop from where the bullet was apparently shot and a towel in which the gun was wrapped. The DNA samples on the towel matched with Robinson, the FBI director said.""I can report today that the DNA hits from the towel that was wrapped around the firearm and the DNA on the screwdriver are positively processed for the suspect in custody,"" Patel said.Patel also confirmed that Robinson's family members collectively told the law enforcement that Robinson was influenced by left-wing ideologies.There was a chilling note before the shooting was carried out in which Robinson told someone that he had an opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and he was going to do it. Patel said he can't speak on ideologies but the fact is that Tyler did what he did because of his hatred for what Charlie stood for.The written note was destroyed, Patel said, adding that they found forensic evidence to show what that note was.","Tyler Robinson reportedly confessed to have killed Charlie Kirk in a Discord group chat two hours before his arrest.

A second hanging fuels speculation



What's next?







The family of 21-year-old Demartravion “Trey” Reed, a Delta State University student, is demanding an independent autopsy after his body was found hanging from a tree on campus. Reed’s death, discovered early on Monday, 15 September, has triggered widespread outrage, with civil rights leaders, politicians and community members calling for a full and transparent investigation.Delta State University police said there was no evidence of foul play, but Reed’s family remain unconvinced. At a press event on Tuesday in Grenada, Mississippi, their lawyer said the family were left in the dark by officials and were still waiting for answers.Reed’s body was found at 7:05 a.m. near the pickleball courts at Delta State University, Cleveland, Mississippi. The 21-year-old had only recently started his studies at the university. Police Chief Michael Peeler confirmed during a press briefing that there was “no evidence of foul play.” The Bolivar County Coroner’s Office echoed that finding, saying Reed’s body showed no signs of assault. Classes were cancelled, and centennial celebrations were suspended, as the university community was left shaken by the news.At a press event in Grenada, family lawyer Vanessa J. Jones said: “The family does not know exactly what happened on September the 15th of 2025. We are seeking answers from Delta State University. We’re seeking answers from the coroner’s office.” Jones insisted that surveillance footage from the campus should show Reed’s final movements. “Bring the surveillance, bring the cameras so that we’ll know exactly what happened,” she said, pressing for clarity.Jones condemned how officials handled communication with the family. “The media knew about Trey’s death before the family did,” she said, adding that information had been relayed second-hand and inaccurately. At one point, Grenada County deputies told Reed’s family he had been found dead in his dorm room, only for them to later learn he had died hanging from a tree in the centre of campus. Jones said such confusion deepened the family’s mistrust in the authorities’ handling of the case.Speaking at the same event, Pastor Jerry Reed, Trey’s uncle, remembered his nephew as ambitious and cheerful. “When I talked to him, he always told me that he had a plan for his life, and many things he wanted. He wanted to go to college. He wanted to be a truck driver. Because that’s what I was, for nearly 30 years, and that’s what he wanted to be.” Family members described Reed as “our little quiet light” who was “sweet, well mannered, and would give you the world if he could. ”Civil rights attorney Ben Crump has joined the Reed family in demanding an independent investigation. “His family and the campus community deserve a full, independent investigation to uncover the truth about what happened. We cannot accept vague conclusions when so many questions remain,” Crump said. He promised to lead a team of civil rights leaders and organisations to pursue transparency and accountability. The NAACP also expressed scepticism, writing on social media: “Our people have not historically hung ourselves from trees.”Congressman Bennie Thompson, whose district covers the area, urged the U.S. Department of Justice and FBI to investigate. “We must leave no stone unturned in the search for answers,” he said, citing Mississippi’s “painful history of lynching and racial violence against African Americans.” The Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus also issued a statement, vowing to press officials for full transparency. The FBI said it stood ready to assist if evidence of a federal crime emerged.Bolivar County Coroner Rudolph Seals released a statement denying social media rumours that Reed had broken bones or injuries consistent with an assault. “Based on the preliminary examination, we can confirm that the deceased did not suffer any lacerations, contusions, compound fractures, broken bones, or injuries consistent with an assault. At this time, there is no evidence to suggest the individual was physically attacked before his death. ” However, Deputy Coroner Murray Roark described the death as “self-done,” while declining to elaborate.News of Reed’s death quickly went viral, with many users linking it to Mississippi’s history of racist violence. One widely shared post declared: “A Black student lynched in 2025, not 1925. Do not let them bury his story.” Others wrongly claimed his body showed signs of a beating. Civil rights groups, community leaders, and ordinary citizens echoed concerns that the official narrative was incomplete. The widespread speculation has intensified calls for transparency, highlighting a deep mistrust of official accounts in cases involving Black victims.Just hours after Reed’s body was discovered, police in Vicksburg, 100 miles away, found the body of a homeless white man, also hanging from a tree. The coincidence fuelled rumours online that the two cases were linked. However, Vicksburg Police Captain Curtis Judge confirmed there was no connection. Still, the timing added to online suspicion and reinforced calls for federal involvement. Authorities emphasised that both cases were being investigated separately and urged the public not to spread misinformation.Delta State University President Dr Dan Ennis said the institution was “deeply saddened” and had offered condolences to the family. A campus vigil was held on Monday night to honour Reed’s life. Yet, Reed’s family insist they have received no direct answers. “We’re not going to point fingers at anybody. We’re not going to call anybody any names. All we want is answers,” lawyer Vanessa Jones said. With investigations ongoing, the family’s demand for an independent autopsy ensures the case will remain under close national scrutiny.","Demartravion ‘Trey’ Reed, 21, was found hanging from a tree on campus.

Tyler Robinson in court today: What to expect







The FBI announced a $100,000 reward for any information in connection with the person who shot Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University -- before the arrest of Tyler Robinson. While the manhunt was on, several private individuals, including Trump advisor Alex Bruesewitz, conservative activist Robby Starbuck and billionaire Bill Ackman, offered to increase the amount.But it was Tyler's father, Matthew Robinson or Matt Robinson who turned him in after he identified his son from the videos and photos that the FBI released. Tyler threatened his father that he would end his life rather than getting arrested but his father convinced him and they got in touch with the law enforcement, making Tyler's arrest possible.In custody, Tyler has not yet confessed to the crime and will make his first court appearance today.But questions are being raised as to what will happen to the reward money. Tyler's father is officially eligible to get the money as FBI guidelines allow rewards for tips from family members if the information directly aids the investigation.But claims are floating on social media that he refused to take the money and offered to donate it to Charlie Kirk's Foundation. However, there is no confirmation of the same and it is not yet confirmed whether he got the money or not.Matt Robinson received praise for his brave act to hand his son over to the law enforcement at a time when he could face the death penalty for killing Charlie Kirk. Matt is a registered Republican and a Trump supporter. The family cooperated with the investigation and told cops that Tyler had become more political in recent years and hated Kirk.Utah Governor Spencer Cox earlier said that Tobinson would be formally charged today. ""There will be much more information that is released in the charging documents as they're bringing that together. I'd just like to remind people that press conference on Friday, we had been up all night trying to get as much as we could in a very short amount of time. We're collecting much more, including forensic evidence that is coming back from Quantico that will help us tie the shooter to the weapon and everything else. That is all being processed right now, and there will be much more information on Tuesday when that document is filed with the courts,"" Cox said.","Tyler Robinson, the suspected shooter of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, will make his first court appearance today.

Is there any connection between them?



Same day, two hangings: Officials refute internet rumors







Amid rumors swirling around the mysterious death of a Black student of Delta State, Trey Reed, another similar incident came to be reported from a different part of Mississippi. Inside the university, Demartravion “Trey” Reed, 21, was found hanging from a tree. In Vicksburg, the body of another person, Cory Zukatis, 36, a white male and a Brandon resident, was found hanging in a wooded area.No, there was no connection between them. They did not know each other. Autopsies are going on both bodies, but preliminary investigation ruled out any foul play in either case.Internet rumors claimed Trey Reed was lynched to death and his bones were broken. And Internet sleuths connected his death with the other as it's strange for two similar suicides to take place on the same day.The Bolivar County Coroner released a statement regarding Trey's death. “At this current time, we are conducting a thorough death investigation,” said the release from Bolivar County Coroner Randolph Seals Jr. “Based on the preliminary investigation, we can confirm that the deceased did not suffer any lacerations, contusions, compound fractures, broken bones, or injuries consistent with an assault. At this time, there is no evidence to suggest the individual was physically attacked before his death.On Zukatis' death, Warren County coroner Doug Husket said the body will be sent for autopsy but there are no immediate signs that Zukatis’ death and Reed’s death are connected.The timing and imagery of the hangings caused random speculation, with many recalling the racist lynchings of mostly Black people—something Mississippi, and the greater American South, has dealt with for centuries. The Delta State community has been especially disturbed, as Reed’s body was found on campus during the week of the school’s centennial celebration.","The body of Cory Zukatis, 36, a white male and a Brandon resident, was found hanging in a wooded area in Vicksburg, Mississippi.

FBI Uncovers SHOCKING DNA Proof Against Charlie Kirk Assassin Tyler Robinson; Chilling Note Exposed

Poll Do you think social media platforms should monitor and restrict violent content more strictly? Yes, stricter monitoring is needed No, it violates free speech

Who is Tyler Robinson?







FBI director Kash Patel on Monday revealed a key development in the investigation into the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk . Patel said the agency has recovered a “text thread” in which the alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson, wrote that he had the chance to kill Kirk and planned to act out of “hatred that cannot be negotiated with. ”In an appearance on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends,” FBI director Patel said investigators believe Tyler Robinson also wrote a physical note stating he had the “opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk” and would do so. Patel said the note was destroyed, but investigators have gathered forensic evidence proving it once existed and confirmed its contents through interviews.“I will say what was found in terms of information, a text message exchange where he, the suspect specifically stated that he had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and he was gonna do that,” FBI director said.He added, “When he was asked why, he said some hatred cannot be negotiated with.”“I can report today that the DNA hits from the towel that was wrapped around the firearm and the DNA on the screwdriver are positively processed for the suspect in custody,” Patel told Fox & Friends.Investigators have not yet publicly disclosed a motive in the case. Law enforcement officials say they believe Robinson acted alone in the shooting of Kirk but are still examining whether anyone else may have been involved in planning the attack.Separately, the Washington Post reported Monday that Robinson had sent a message on the online platform Discord apparently confessing to the crime on Thursday night, just before his arrest.“It was me at UVU yesterday. im sorry for all of this,” read a message from Robinson’s account, according to the newspaper, which cited two people familiar with the chat and screenshots it had reviewed.Kirk, 31, a MAGA star, was shot dead last week during an outdoor event at Utah Valley University. He had been speaking and taking questions about the long-running culture of mass shootings and gun violence in America when the attack took place.US President Donald Trump , visibly affected by the death of his young ally, confirmed Kirk’s killing on Truth Social.He also posted a four-minute video calling the murder “an assassination” and remembering Kirk as “a patriot who devoted his life to open debate and the country he loved so much.”The suspect, arrested and identified by authorities for Kirk's assassination is a 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, a Utah resident.Robinson is a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship programme at Dixie Technical College in St. George, Utah.State records show Robinson is a registered voter but unaffiliated with any political party. He did not vote in the two most recent general elections, despite being of voting age.","FBI director Kash Patel revealed a key development in the investigation into the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Victim rescued







NEW DELHI: Police in Maharashtra are searching for members of the family of dismissed IAS probationer Puja Khedkar after her father and his driver allegedly abducted a truck helper in a road rage incident near Navi Mumbai.The victim, Prahlad Kumar, 22, was bundled into an SUV after it brushed against a concrete mixer truck on the Mulund-Airoli Road last Saturday, police said.He was later rescued from the family’s bungalow in Pune.Officials identified the accused as Dilip Khedkar, a retired state government officer and Puja Khedkar’s father, and his bodyguard, Praful Salunkhe.The Navi Mumbai crime branch, running a parallel probe, is monitoring the family’s financial activities, checking ATM withdrawals, railway stations, toll booths and the family’s farmhouse in Pune. Immigration authorities have also been alerted.Rabale police said three teams have been camping in Pune for the past three days to track the suspects.Officials from Chatushrungi and Rabale police stations also visited the residence of Puja Khedkar on Tuesday to question her mother, Manorama. But she was not found.Senior inspector Uttam Bhajnawale of Chatushrungi police station told TOI, “None of the family members was present in their bungalow on Baner Road.Their caretakers answered our questions.”Police have accused Manorama Khedkar of helping the two men escape. According to officials, she refused to cooperate, promised to produce the accused at a police station but later backed out, ensured the car used in the abduction was removed, and unleashed “ferocious” dogs to scare a police team.“A Rabale police officer rang the bell and asked the watchman to call someone from the house. Manorama Khedkar came out but didn't open the gate. Police explained the purpose of their visit and sought her cooperation in tracing the two individuals and the car involved in the abduction case. However, she refused to open the gate,” an officer said.Instead, she allegedly photographed the FIR and told police she would bring the accused to Chatushrungi police station by 3pm.“Believing her, the police team left the spot. However, when they called her around 3 pm, she refused to come and told them to do whatever they wanted to,” the officer added.A case has since been registered against her under Section 221 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita for obstructing a public servant in the discharge of duty.Police said Kumar was released from the bungalow shortly after officers arrived on Sunday. “Knowing that police were outside, Kumar was released, and the gate of the bungalow was slammed shut,” a Chatushringi officer said.When police returned later, both the suspects and the car involved in the abduction were gone.On Monday, Pune and Navi Mumbai police visited the bungalow again but did not find Manorama there. “Since no one was present to open the main gate, police personnel jumped over the iron gate and entered the premises. However, Manorama Khedkar was not found inside,” said Inspector Bhajanawale.No arrests have been made so far.","Police in Maharashtra are searching for members of the family of dismissed IAS probationer Puja Khedkar.

ABC News chief national correspondent Matt Gutman has drawn fierce backlash after describing the text messages exchanged between accused assassin Tyler Robinson and his partner as “very touching. ” Critics online branded his remarks “disgusting,” accusing him of romanticising a confession to murder.Speaking on ABC News Live, Gutman reflected on the details revealed in court about Robinson, who is accused of fatally shooting conservative activist Charlie Kirk. “It’s heartbreaking on so many levels, Kyra. Obviously, Charlie Kirk was murdered brutally in front of a crowd of thousands,” Gutman said. “On the other hand, there is this duality of a very portrait of a very human person, a very human experience from this entire family. .. the kid who had got a 34 out of 36 on the ACT, who had a 4.0.”He continued: “I don’t think I’ve ever experienced a press conference in which we’ve read text messages that are A, so fulsome, so robust, so apparently, allegedly self-incriminating and yet, on the other hand, so touching — right — with the suspect reaching out to his roommate, who was allegedly his boyfriend, who we understand, you know, identified as male at birth, now identifies as female.And the terminology he used, he was trying to protect him. He kept calling him ‘my love.’ ‘My reason for doing this is to protect you,’ you know, but also asking him to delete the messages and not speak to law enforcement.”Gutman added that he was not sure “if we have seen an alleged murder with such specific text messages” that offered “a very intimate portrait into this relationship between the suspect’s roommate and the suspect himself, with him repeatedly calling his roommate, who is transitioning, calling him ‘my love.’ And ‘I want to protect you, my love.’”Gutman is ABC News’ chief national correspondent and has been with the network for nearly two decades.

Britain rolls out the red carpet for US President Donald Trump, only to troll and mock him. As the Republican leader is all set for his UK visit, protestors on Tuesday projected images of him with his alleged friend and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein onto Windsor Castle in England, where he is expected to stay.Donkey group, which is famous for its viral stunts mocking and targeting politicians, broadcast a video montage on Trump and Epstein for a few minutes on one of the towers of the castle.The video montage included shots of Trump - his mugshot, portraits of Epstein, newspaper headlines and footage of the two men dancing together.According to news agency AFP, four people were arrested ""on suspicion of malicious communications"" following the stunt.""We take any unauthorised activity around Windsor Castle extremely seriously,"" said chief superintendant Felicity Parker of Thames Valley Police. He added that officers ""responded swiftly to stop the projection"".Trump has long struggled to distance himself from stories about his ties to Epstein, who died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking and exploitation charges.The renewed spotlight comes at an awkward moment for both Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who last month dismissed his ambassador to Washington over revelations about the envoy's personal links to Epstein.Dozens of anti-Trump demonstrators gathered at Windsor Castle to protest against Trump even before he touched down.According to AFP, thousands more are planning to demonstrate in London.Hosted by King Charles III and Queen Camilla, Trump and his wife Melania, will stay at Windsor Castle as their guests.On Thursday, he is scheduled to hold political and economic talks with Prime Minister Starmer at Chequers, the PM's country residence, before returning to the United States.","Donkey group broadcast a video montage on Trump and Epstein for a few minutes on one of the towers of the castle.

Charlie Kirk assassination: Leftist ideology the motive?

‘Charlie Kirk’s Shooter Was Radicalised Online’: Trump Slams Social Media For Protecting Extremists

Here are 10 key facts about Charlie Kirk assassination case:

Robinson allegedly confessed and left a chilling note



Was the attack premeditated?

Discord at the centre of investigation



A ‘leftist ideology’ and online radicalisation



What we know about his partner

Details from Tyler Robinson's childhood

Electronic devices and ammunition offer further clues



Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty



The Fallout: National mourning and political repercussions



Security questions and a nation on edge







Six days after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at Utah Valley University, investigators are piecing together a clearer picture of the man accused of carrying out the assassination. Tyler Robinson, 22, was arrested soon after the rooftop attack and now faces the prospect of a capital murder charge.As the FBI and local authorities continue to piece together Robinson’s motive and movements, new revelations paint a chilling portrait of a quiet, intelligent young man whose ideology reportedly turned extreme.FBI Director Kash Patel revealed that Tyler Robinson allegedly sent a text message before the shooting, stating: “I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I was going to do that.” When asked why, he reportedly said: “Some hatred cannot be negotiated with.” According to Patel, Robinson also made online admissions and “essentially admitted” to the shooting through witness interviews. Investigators recovered remnants of a destroyed note in which he claimed he was going to carry out the attack.Robinson allegedly shot Kirk from a rooftop hundreds of yards away from Utah Valley University’s campus, where Kirk was addressing a large crowd. Law enforcement found a rifle wrapped in a towel and a screwdriver near the scene. DNA evidence on both items matched Robinson, according to FBI Director Patel. Investigators also recovered engraved bullets containing taunting messages, including one that read: “Hey, fascist! Catch!”Discord, a messaging platform popular with gamers, has become a focal point of the investigation.Authorities say Robinson communicated with others via Discord about retrieving a weapon from a “drop point” and had conversations involving bullet engraving. However, Discord officials told Fox News Digital that these messages did not take place on their platform and that they found no evidence Robinson used Discord to plan the attack. Nonetheless, the FBI is examining Robinson’s entire digital footprint, including chat logs, phone messages, and social media activity.Utah Governor Spencer Cox said Robinson's family and friends described him as politically shifting “to the left” in recent years and spending increasing time in the “dark corners of the internet.” Authorities believe his ideology played a role, although a clear motive remains unconfirmed. “There clearly was a leftist ideology,” said Cox on NBC’s Meet the Press, noting that Kirk’s controversial stances, particularly on transgender issues, may have made him a target.Robinson's romantic partner is transgender, a detail some political figures have pointed to as a possible reason behind the assassination, given Kirk’s vocal stance against transgender rights. However, authorities have not confirmed any direct connection between Robinson’s personal relationship and the motive for the killing. Utah’s public safety commissioner said the partner has been “incredibly cooperative” and had no knowledge of the plan.Robinson grew up in St. George, Utah, in what appears to be a stable and outdoors-oriented family. He was a high school honours student, scoring in the 99th percentile nationally on standardised tests. He was accepted into Utah State University on an academic scholarship but only completed one semester. At the time of the shooting, he was a third-year student in an electrical apprenticeship programme at Dixie Technical College. His family has not commented publicly.FBI agents seized multiple electronic devices from Robinson’s home, including laptops, gaming systems, and mobile phones. According to Director Patel, investigators are conducting a “reverse daisy chain analysis” of everyone Robinson contacted. Ammunition found at the scene featured anti-fascist engravings and meme-culture references. Prosecutors have not ruled out additional federal charges, depending on what further evidence is uncovered.Utah prosecutors are expected to indict Robinson for first-degree murder and other felonies, including obstruction of justice and unlawful discharge of a firearm. State Attorney General Pam Bondi has stated her office will pursue the death penalty, describing it as “very real in Utah,” where firing squads remain a legal form of execution. Federal prosecutors are also weighing potential charges.Kirk’s assassination has triggered a wave of grief across the country. Vigils were held in Washington D.C., Arizona, and Utah. At Utah Valley University, students created a makeshift memorial of flowers and flags. Vice President JD Vance, a personal friend of Kirk, hosted an emotional tribute on The Charlie Kirk Show. Meanwhile, public workers, teachers, and even media commentators have faced consequences for mocking or criticising Kirk’s death, sparking a national conversation about free speech and political civility.The attack has raised serious questions about the adequacy of security at political events, especially on college campuses. Kirk often insisted on being close to students and the public, with varying levels of protection. As more details emerge, officials and security experts are reviewing protocols. FBI Director Patel stressed that authorities are still investigating whether Robinson acted entirely alone or had support. Utah officials said they are examining every possible contact Robinson had in the lead-up to the assassination.","Tyler Robinson, 22, allegedly shot conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University.

Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, has been left reeling after the body of a student, Demartravion “Trey” Reed, was found hanging from a tree on campus, Fox News reported. The 21-year-old, from Grenada, Mississippi, was discovered on Monday morning in the central part of campus near the pickleball courts, according to University Police Chief Michael Peeler. He confirmed that Reed’s death is under investigation but said there is no evidence of foul play and no ongoing threat to campus safety.In a statement, Delta State President Dr Dan Ennis said the community was “deeply saddened by this loss” and that he had spoken to Reed’s family to express the university’s “heartbreak.” He added that counselling services were being made available to students, faculty and staff. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, the Bolivar County Sheriff’s Office, Cleveland Police Department, and the Bolivar County Coroner are all involved in the inquiry, with an autopsy set to be conducted.Fox 13 Memphis reported that Reed’s body was discovered around 7am on September 15. Chief Peeler told reporters that while the circumstances were tragic, students should know the campus remains safe.“I just want to confirm, this is a safe campus. Delta State University is a beautiful place to be. It’s just unfortunate this loss that comes heavily to our campus,” he said.The discovery prompted the immediate closure of the campus, with all classes and events cancelled. The Independent reported that celebrations marking the university’s 100th anniversary, scheduled for Monday, were also called off. Officials said further updates would be shared “when appropriate” and urged compassion for Reed’s loved ones during what they described as a “difficult time.”The university has not confirmed when normal operations will resume. Authorities said the investigation remains active and urged the public to direct all questions to University Police.","Demartravion ""Trey"" Reed, 21, was found hanging from a tree on campus.

US Vice-President JD Vance has said that national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk , warning that such behaviour fuels further political violence.Speaking as guest host of The Charlie Kirk Show on Monday, Vance said: “Call them out, and hell, call their employer. We don't believe in political violence, but we do believe in civility.”The vice-president took over presenting duties from his ceremonial office at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, with the programme livestreamed into the White House press briefing room. It was the first episode of the podcast since Kirk, 31, was fatally shot in the neck while moderating a debate at Utah Valley University last week.Vance, who flew Kirk’s body home to Arizona aboard Air Force Two, said he was “filling in for somebody who cannot be filled in for”. He recounted conversations with Kirk’s widow Erika, describing him as “a kind, loving husband”, and admitted her words had inspired him to “be a better husband and… a better father”.In his remarks, Vance directly challenged those making light of Kirk’s assassination. “There is no unity with the people who celebrate Charlie Kirk's assassination,” he said.“There is no unity with someone who lies about what Charlie Kirk said in order to excuse his murder… And there is no unity with the people who fund these articles, who pay the salaries of these terrorist sympathisers who argue that Charlie Kirk, a loving husband and father, deserved a shot to the neck because he spoke words with which they disagree. ”He added: “I’m desperate for our country to be united in condemnation of the actions and the ideas that killed my friend. I want it so badly that I will tell you a difficult truth. We can only have it with people who acknowledge that political violence is unacceptable.”Other Republicans have echoed calls for accountability. Florida congressman Randy Fine said he would “demand their firing, defunding, and licence revocation”, while South Carolina’s Nancy Mace urged federal funding to be cut from universities that refuse to act.Vance, who described Kirk as a close friend and mentor, credited him with helping President Donald Trump’s re-election and with shaping the administration. “If it weren't for Charlie Kirk, I would not be the vice president of the United States,” he said.","US Vice-President JD Vance said national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Matt Robinson, believed to be the father of 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, was hailed as the 'father of justice' as he reportedly turned his son in after Tyler allegedly killed Charlie Kirk.

He even threatened to kill himself rather than surrender to the authorities when his father wanted to call the police.

Even as floodwaters began to recede in parts of south Punjab, the scale of destruction remains staggering, nearly 2.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes and at least 101 lives have been lost, the Dawn reported.The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has called the ongoing evacuation and relief drive one of the largest in recent memory. More than 1,500 boats were deployed to rescue stranded families, with 12,427 people evacuated from villages along the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers.Multan, Muzaffargarh and Rahim Yar Khan districts bore the brunt of the floods. Entire villages were submerged — including the union council of Lati Mari in Alipur tehsil, home to 40,000 people.“Nearly 15,000 people from our basti had to leave on their own as water rose,” said Syed Kausar Shah, a local resident. “Homes and crops were destroyed, and people escaped on a hired boat. Some now live in relief camps, others under the open sky.” He added that two villagers drowned while attempting to flee.Officials declared Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur tehsils safe after a major flood wave passed through Head Panjnad.Multan Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu confirmed that 100,000 people had been evacuated from Jalalpur Pirwala alone in three days.Breaches in Shujabad and Jalalpur Pirwala are now being filled, while helicopters and drones drop food and medicine into cut-off areas. Boats continue to ferry supplies into rural belts.At a press briefing in Bahawalpur, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said Panjnad Headworks still faced a “high flood” but levels had dropped from 700,000 cusecs earlier this week to 575,000 cusecs on Saturday. By evening, the Flood Forecasting Division reported further decline to 492,695 cusecs.“There is no threat to Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur cities,” Kathia assured, adding that water in Bahawalpur would also recede within 24 hours.

The sons of jailed former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said their father “will not be broken” by his “unlawful” imprisonment, as his legal team lodged an appeal with the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture.The elder son, Sulaiman Khan, condemned Khan's treatment in a statement attached to the appeal:Our father is being kept in conditions that no human being should endure. These are violations of his rights, and they amount to torture.”The younger son, Kasim Khan, said:The UN has already recognised that our father’s imprisonment is arbitrary and unlawful. What he is enduring now shows how far the regime will go to break him. But he will not be broken.”Sulaiman and Kasim are the cricketer-turned-politician’s sons with British filmmaker Jemima Goldsmith, with whom he was married for nine years until 2004. They live in the UK with Goldsmith.The appeal, filed by the US-based law firm Perseus Strategies on behalf of Khan’s legal team, alleged a “systematic pattern of abuse, including prolonged solitary confinement, denial of medical care, contaminated food, and restricted access to legal counsel and family visits.”His lawyers argued that these conditions breach Pakistan’s obligations under the UN Convention against Torture (CAT) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). They urged the UN to press authorities to safeguard the former PM’s physical and mental well-being.Khan has been in prison since August 2023 after being charged in multiple cases.","The sons of jailed former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said their father “will not be broken” by his “unlawful” imprisonment.

A Pakistani Taliban ambush in northwest Pakistan on Saturday resulted in the deaths of at least 12 soldiers, as confirmed by local government and security officials to AFP.During a military convoy's passage through South Waziristan district at 4:00 am, ""armed men opened fire from both sides with heavy weapons"", resulting in 12 security personnel deaths and four injuries, according to a local government official.The area's security officer verified the casualties and reported that the assailants captured the convoy's weaponry.The Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban, took responsibility for the attack via social media.This incident ranks among the most severe attacks in recent months within Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where the TTP previously controlled significant territories until a 2014 military operation forced their retreat.Since the Afghan Taliban's return to power in Kabul in 2021, militant activities have intensified in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border regions. Although distinct organisations, the TTP maintains close ties with the Afghan Taliban.Pakistan contends that Afghanistan fails to remove militants who use Afghan soil to attack Pakistan, whilst Kabul authorities reject these claims.Local residents across various Khyber Pakhtunkhwa districts have recently reported TTP-branded graffiti appearing on buildings, expressing concerns about a potential return to the group's previous control during the height of the US ""War on Terror"".A high-ranking local government official recently informed AFP about increased TTP fighter presence and attack frequency.Since January 1, approximately 460 individuals, predominantly security forces personnel, have lost their lives in attacks by anti-state armed groups in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces, according to AFP's records.Pakistan experienced its most lethal period in nearly ten years during the previous year, with over 1,600 fatalities, including almost half being soldiers and police officers, as reported by the Islamabad-based Center for Research and Security Studies.","Pakistani Taliban ambush in northwest Pakistan kills at least 12 soldiers.

The firewall, known as WMS 2.0, inspects internet traffic and can block 2 million active sessions at once.The human rights watchdog said it reviewed licensing agreements, trade data, leaked technical files, and Chinese records linking the firewall supplier to state-owned firms in Beijing.Amnesty said the firewall uses equipment from US-based Niagara Networks, software from Thales DIS — a unit of France's Thales — and servers from a Chinese state IT firm. An earlier version relied on Canada’s Sandvine.""The two monitoring systems function in tandem: one lets intelligence agencies tap calls and texts, while the other slows or blocks websites and social media across the country,"" the report said.""Mass surveillance creates a chilling effect in society, whereby people are deterred from exercising their rights, both online and offline,"" it added.The report further said that Pakistan is currently blocking about 650,000 web links and restricting access to platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and X.It also accused agencies of spying on at least 4 million mobile phones at a time through LIMS, while WMS 2.0 can block 2 million active sessions at once, Amnesty said.Amnesty noted that its findings draw on a 2024 Islamabad High Court case filed by Bushra Bibi, the wife of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, after her private calls were leaked online.In court, Pakistan's defense ministries and intelligence agencies denied running or even having the capacity for phone tapping. However, under questioning, the telecom regulator admitted it had already ordered phone companies to install LIMS for use by ""designated agencies.""Crackdowns have tightened in recent years, particularly after the military broke with then Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022. Khan was later jailed, and thousands of his party activists were detained.","Amnesty International: Pakistan using Chinese-built internet firewall that censors social media.

Poll Should politics focus on respectful dialogue instead of personal attacks? Yes, respect should come first No, conflict is part of politics





Aleema Khan, sister of Pakistan 's jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , was attacked with an egg while addressing reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Friday.A video of the episode has gone viral on social media, showing the egg hitting Aleema as she spoke to the media.Supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party quickly apprehended two women accused of throwing the eggs and handed them over to police, news agency PTI reported.Rawalpindi police said the arrested women were PTI party supporters who had travelled with members of the All-Government Employees Grand Alliance to protest against unmet demands.The statement added that the egg was thrown after Aleema did not respond to questions from the two women. Both were later taken into custody and moved to the Adiala checkpoint.PTI condemned the act as “shameful,” alleging the women were planted for political motives and accusing police of helping them escape in a car. “The women were sent to Aleema's media talk as part of an agenda,” the party said.Leaders across the political spectrum criticized the attack.Balochistan National Party-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal condemned the act, calling it “the lowest form of politics.”He said, “Even in enmity, a woman deserves dignity. Targeting women is the lowest form of politics, and this cheap stunt must be condemned in the strongest words.”Federal minister for development Ahsan Iqbal said, “Politics must remain a contest of ideas, not of violence or hatred. We should all work to keep it healthy and respectful.”Meanwhile, PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique described the incident as “shameful, vile and crude.”Imran Khan has been in prison for more than two years facing multiple charges. In January 2025, a Pakistani tribunal sentenced the former prime minister to 14 years in prison, while his wife, Bushra Bibi, received a seven-year sentence in connection with a corruption case involving land graft.The allegations centred on the acceptance of land from a property magnate in exchange for facilitating money laundering during Khan’s tenure as prime minister.Prior to this verdict, Khan had received three separate convictions related to corruption, disclosure of state secrets, and violations of marriage laws, carrying sentences of 10, 14 and seven years respectively.","Aleema Khan was attacked with an egg while addressing reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Friday.

IuM-Pakistan claims suicide bomb attack on army convoy in KP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/ium-pakistan-claims-suicide-bomb-attack-on-army-convoy-in-kp/articleshow/123688414.cms,"



A relatively unknown militant group, Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.The outfit claimed the attack, which involved a car rigged with IED, killed more than two dozen members of the Frontier Corps but Pakistan acknowledged only six fatalities. Predictably, it blamed India for the attack. Pakistan claimed to have neutralised five operatives in a 12-hour counter operation but the group asserted that its 'fidayeen' blew themselves up after carrying out the attack. One of the suicide bombers was identified by the group as Abdul Aziz alias Qassid Mohajir, a resident of Afghanistan's Paktika province.The Pakistan army camp suffered massive destruction in the suicide attack. Pakistan military's ISPR played down the incident, the latest in a series of attacks on Pakistani military personnel. ""During early hours of Sept 2, Indian proxy 'Fitna al Khwarij' targeted the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Bannu district. The Indian-sponsored Kharjis attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by vigilant and resolute response.In their desperation, the Kahrjis rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. The suicide blast resulted in the partial collapse of the perimeter wall and damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, inflicting injuries to three innocent civilians,"" ISPR said.IuM Pakistan, active since April, comprises fighters from outfits like Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-e-Islam and Jamaat-Ul-Ahrar. In the last few months, it has claimed multiple attacks in areas like North Waziristan, Miranshah and Tirah Valley. Its strikes included sniper, rocket launcher and grenade attacks, and ambushes on convoys, besides drone strikes. Its formation had attracted criticism from groups like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan which termed itself as the most structured and legitimate jihadi group in Pakistan.","Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.

Netizens came up with more suggestions to utilize flood waters in Pakistan after defence minister Khawaja Asif shared a bizarre flood mitigation measure for those affected asking them to consider ""storing"" the water in ""tubs"".""You can even make a milkshake out of that water and sell it, export ideas by the minister.

Moreover, he also suggested building dams for storing flood waters.The TOI could not independently verify the authenticity of this video.Similar claims were made by him while speaking on the floor of the national assembly. “In my own district, seasonal streams have wreaked havoc because people have built homes right on the drains,” he said, adding that powerful groups have even set up housing societies on river land. “Everyone knows who these people are; some of them are sitting in the Upper House,” Dunya News quoted him saying.“We are letting water go down the drain. We must store it,” he added.Pakistan’s Punjab is reeling under an intensifying flood crisis as the Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers swell to “exceptionally high” levels, inundating large areas.
