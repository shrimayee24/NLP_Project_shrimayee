NEW DELHI: Manipur CM N Biren Singh on Saturday condemned ""indiscriminate firing by Kuki militants"" in two villages in Imphal East district that left civilians and security personnel injured. Calling for calm and unity in the face of fresh violence, Biren Singh said all necessary measures have been put in place to handle the situation.""Strongly condemn the indiscriminate firing by Kuki militants at Sanasabi and Thamnapokpi in Imphal East, which injured civilians and security personnel.

Security forces responded, leading to a fierce exchange of fire.In Sanasabi village , two individuals sustained injuries during the clash. A 37-year-old police officer, K Haridash, suffered a bullet wound to his left shoulder and was rushed to Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences around 3:30 PM.Additionally, a ""village volunteer"" sustained minor hand injuries and was treated at a private hospital, where his condition was reported to be stable.

Another attack was reported in Thamnapokpi village around 11:30 AM, creating further panic among residents. Security forces, including CRPF personnel, managed to rescue several women, children, and elderly individuals trapped in the crossfire.Since May last year, ethnic violence between the Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities in Manipur has claimed over 250 lives and displaced thousands."," Manipur CM N Biren Singh condemns ""indiscriminate firing by Kuki militants"" in two villages in Imphal East district.

The Warrior Monk: Lessons in Courage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-warrior-monk-lessons-in-courage/articleshow/116712424.cms,"Thirukkural

with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

""Be assured that they shall not last long, those who do not humble the

Pride of the enemies who defy them""

Viduthalai, a recent movie by Vetrimaaran, had the couplet above as its tag line. These ancient words of Thiruvalluvar also serve as a commentary to the theme of the movie, the eternal dance between power and resistance.The film weaves its narrative around Perumal, whose journey becomes a lens through which we examine whether ideological conviction can bring justice.The screenplay draws from Jayamohan's short story ‘Thunaivan’ ­. A young constable is accompanying his superior officer and a handcuffed prisoner -- a revolutionary leader whose hands are stained with the blood of two policemen. Through the prisoner's sardonic jokes and casual conversation, a darker truth emerges: this journey's destination is not a courtroom, but an execution ground. An encounter is the plan but will later be guised as an escape attempt by the prisoner.The narrative takes a turn as we learn the revolutionary's motive -- retribution for a police ambush that left innocent villagers dead and women violated. “I don't know the two policemen I killed,” he says. ""But I know they represented power. No agent of power will do this again. I have planted fear in them.”In the story's climactic moments, the young constable's hands tremble around his weapon, the prisoner welcomes death as an honourable exit. Butas the prisoner's body grows still, he lights a cigarette with steady hands, a symbolic passing of the torch of violence.This narrative serves as the foundation for ‘Viduthalai’, which explores revolutionary movements, their ideological underpinnings, and the complex role of police officers as instruments of power. The choice of Thiruvalluvar's couplet raises provocative questions: Who truly embodies the enemy? The police, the power structures they protect or the revolutionaries who target them.The answer perhaps lies in the universal truth that human conflict often stems from pride -- both personal and collective. When the collective pride supports power, revolutionaries emerge. There are martyrs on both sides.Warriors throughout history have sought honourable deaths at the hands of enemies. Tamil culture has long honoured such warriors through consecrated tombstones. Time's relentless march has erased many of their stories, leaving only silent stone testimonies to their courage.That, Thiruvalluvar, known for his wisdom and spiritual teachings, chose to speak in the voice of a military commander is intriguing. His words echo through the ages, resonating with Churchill's famous exhortation, ""Be ye men of valour, for it is better to perish in battle than to look upon the outrage of our nation."" This same spirit lives in countless battlefield speeches and locker room talks, where commanders or coaches synergise the energy of the team through a warrior’s call to overcome enemies.That a monk could teach the art of war should not surprise us. For in the end, war and peace are not opposites but complementary faces of humanity's eternal struggle for justice and dignity. Like the young constable in ‘Thunaivan’ we all must eventually confront the moment when our trembling hands must choose between action and acquiescence, between the peace we desire and the conflict we cannot avoid.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116719178,imgsize-41014,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/116719178.jpg"
Key 26/11 plotter Makki dies of 'heart attack' in Lahore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/key-26/11-plotter-makki-dies-of-heart-attack-in-lahore/articleshow/116724852.cms,"NEW DELHI: A declassified document recovered from Osama bin Laden 's Abbottabad hideout described the 2008 Mumbai attack as a ""heroic Fidai operation"". A year before the attack, al-Qaida chief Ayman al-Zawahiri made a clandestine visit to Islamabad to confer with the outfit's former leader Osama. The meeting was arranged by Hafiz Abdul Rehman Makki , who died of a reported heart attack in Lahore early on Friday.Jamaat-ud-Dawa said Makki was undergoing treatment for ""high blood pressure"" at a hospital there. The perpetrator of numerous terr attacks, also brother-in-law of Lashkar-e-Taiba chief Hafiz Saeed, Makki's notoriety fetched him the tag of "" global terrorist "". As the chief fundraiser for Lashkar, Makki's role was pivotal not only in orchestrating the 26/11 attacks , which claimed 166 lives. His terror rapsheet included several attacks, such as the one on Red Fort in 2000. Unlike other terrorists who like working on their own, Makki believed in forging collaborations, even with those following a different school of fanaticism.His alliances with Taliban founder Mullah Omar and other key figures in the terror hierarchy only served to amplify his agenda. Makki's meetings with al-Zawahiri, Osama and other connected intermediaries along the Af-Pak border between 2005 and 2007 laid the groundwork for a series of devastating attacks. The 2007 meeting between al-Zawahiri and Osama, orchestrated by Makki, was a chilling precursor to the horrors that would unfold in Mumbai a year later.Last year, the UN Security Council placed him on its sanctions list, prompting him to go into a life of self-imposed exile. ""As Makki, a resident of Muridke, spearheaded fundraising operations for Lashkar, he forged robust alliances with Mullah Omer, prompting the US to recognise the threat he posed. Between 2005-10, Makki convened multiple India-focused meets on the Af-Pak border with Omar, al-Zawahiri and other conduits, drawing the attention of India's external intelligence agency,"" a top intelligence officer said.Makki also cultivated a pseudonym, taught at a university in Saudi Arabia, and authored a book distinguishing fidayeen operations from suicide attacks, reads a dossier on him. Makki's reported demise brings to a close a chapter in the complex web of global terrorism, but his legacy as a mastermind of mayhem will continue to haunt.","Hafiz Abdul Rehman Makki died of a reported heart attack in Lahore early on Friday.

For Centre, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said ensuring Dallewal's health is priority. Defusing the situation is secondary: ""It is state govt which must act to comply with the unambiguous order of the highest court.""The bench agreed with SG and told Punjab govt that it must first ensure the health of the fasting farmer and thereafter the court would do everything possible to hear Dallewal's point of view.",Supreme Court asks Punjab govt why contempt proceedings not initiated against them.

The city crime branch has ruled out the dispute over Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) projects in Bandra East as the motive. The police are likely to submit the chargesheet against 26 arrested accused in a week.Siddique was shot dead on Oct 12 near son Zeeshan Siddique's office in Bandra East. The Bishnoi gang had fired at Salman Khan's bungalow on April 14 for his alleged involvement in killing of a black buck in Rajasthan.A police officer said, ""Prima facie, we have not found any evidence to link the murder to SRA dispute as alleged by Siddiqui's son Zeeshan. Though we recorded statements from a few developers, nothing came out. We are relying on whatever one of the suspects, Shubam Lonkar alias Shubbu, uploaded in a post on social media claiming responsibility two days after the firing."" Lonkar, who is on the run, had claimed the Bishnoi gang was behind the killing. Anmol Bishnoi is holed up in Canada and police are in the process of trying to get him to India.The SRA angle was initially explored after a post on X from Siddiqui's son Zeeshan. Zeeshan had raised the SRA issue with govt officials and in his post, he claimed that his father died protecting the lives and homes of the poor.Sources said that the chargesheet is almost ready and will be filed in the first week of Jan 2025 before Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime (MCOCA) court against 26 arrested accused.

British-Indian writer says he had a chat with Luigi Mangione: 'His major concern was...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/british-indian-writer-says-he-had-a-chat-with-luigi-mangione-his-major-concern-was-/articleshow/116656189.cms,"Luigi Mangione was concerned about 'non-playing characters' and identified himself as one, a writer revealed.

Agency was a major concern of Luigi's

'I was sickened. Vigilantism is always wrong'

'I didn't know he had spinal or mental issues'

British-Indian writer Gurwinder Bhogal has claimed that long before the shocking murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, he had a video call and a chat with accused Luigi Mangione around April-May when Mangione was vacationing in Japan.The author described how Luigi Mangione reached out to him through membership of his blog and was warm and gregarious. Mangione told him that he was on holiday in Japan and loved the culture there -- its sense of honor. ""One morning in Japan, he saw a man having a seizure in the street, so he ran to the nearest police station for help. They followed him back to the man, but refused to cross any street if the stoplight was red—even if the road was empty—as the man was seizing on the ground. Mangione lamented what he called “a lack of free will” in Japan, by which he meant a lack of agency,"" Bhogal described an anecdote from his interaction with Mangione.""I quickly realised that agency was a major concern of Luigi’s,"" the writer added.""Luigi believed people everywhere were becoming NPCs (Non-player characters -- people who don't think for themselves), increasingly living their lives as a series of reflex reactions rather than consciously choosing their behaviours.

Silenced expertise

Renewed calls for transparency

Spy chiefs allegedly silenced US defense department and FBI researchers who uncovered evidence supporting the theory that Covid-19 leaked from a Chinese lab, sources told The Post. These findings were excluded from an August 2021 report presented to President Joe Biden, which concluded the virus was ""probably not genetically engineered.""Three scientists—John Hardham, Robert Cutlip, and Jean-Paul Chretien—investigated the origins of Covid-19 and uncovered compelling data favoring the lab leak theory, including:Despite the findings, intelligence officials excluded them from the report to Biden and barred the researchers from sharing their analysis with Congress or the FBI, the latter being the only agency to conclude with confidence that a lab leak was the likely origin.“The scientists with subject matter expertise were silenced,” a source familiar with the investigation claimed, adding that Biden and senior officials were unaware of the withheld evidence. Additionally, federal grant documents detailing a “blueprint” for engineering viruses like SARS-CoV-2 were improperly classified, according to whistleblower Lt. Col. Joseph Murphy.FBI scientist Jason Bannan, whose team supported the lab leak theory, criticized the lack of transparency in the intelligence community’s findings. “What ended up on the cutting-room floor needs to be re-examined,” Bannan told The Wall Street Journal.The suppressed findings have reignited demands for a deeper probe into Covid-19’s origins, as the virus has claimed over 1.2 million American lives since 2019.","Spy chiefs allegedly silenced US defense department and FBI researchers who uncovered evidence supporting the theory that Covid-19 leaked from a Chinese lab.

Who was Robert Brooks? Handcuffed New York inmate brutally beaten to death by correctional officers; Shocking video of final moments released,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-was-robert-brooks-new-york-inmate-brutally-beaten-to-death-by-guards-shocking-video-of-final-moments-released/articleshow/116729254.cms,"According to James, the body cameras were activated, but the guards did not turn on the audio, leaving the recording eerily soundless during the violent confrontation.

'Haunting moment of Brooks being dragged from the bed'

Governor Hochul's response to the incident

In a release that has sent shockwaves through the public, law enforcement in New York has unveiled devastating body-worn camera footage from the night of December 9, capturing the final moments of 43-year-old Robert Brooks ’ life. Brooks, a Black inmate serving a 12-year sentence for assault at a northern New York prison, was brutally beaten by multiple prison guards.The chilling video showed one of the officers use a shoe to strike Brooks in the stomach, another yanks him up by his neck and drops him back on the table. The officers then remove the man’s shirt and pants as he lies motionless and bloodied on the table.Tragically, Brooks was pronounced dead later that night.Watch the full footage here-The footage, though harrowing, was released by New York Attorney General Letitia James to ensure “transparency and accountability” in the aftermath of Brooks’ death. The video, however, was shockingly silent. According to James, the body cameras were activated, but the guards did not turn on the audio, leaving the recording eerily soundless during the violent confrontation.In the grainy, silent footage, Brooks can be seen lying on a hospital bed, pinned down by several guards. At one point, he is dragged off the bed by his collar, his body limp and bloodied. A preliminary autopsy report confirmed the cause of death as “asphyxia due to compression of the neck,” although full results are still pending.Brooks was serving a 12-year sentence for first-degree assault, according to the Associated Press. He had been transferred to Marcy from the nearby Mohawk Correctional Facility on the same day as the incident.Brooks’ family, understandably shaken, has expressed outrage and sorrow over the release of the footage. In a statement, they called the video ""devastating"" and said watching the ""horrific and violent final moments"" of Robert’s life was a painful experience for them. They vowed to seek justice, saying, “We will not rest until we have secured justice for Robert's memory.”New York Governor Kathy Hochul condemned the incident, declaring in a statement, “We have no tolerance for individuals who cross the line, break the law, and engage in unnecessary violence or targeted abuse.” She emphasized that such actions would not be tolerated in New York.The release of this footage comes as the nation continues to grapple with issues of police and prison brutality, particularly toward Black individuals. The tragic events surrounding George Floyd’s death in 2020 sparked national protests demanding racial justice and accountability, and this latest incident is likely to fuel further calls for change.The video has already become a rallying point for those demanding reforms within the U.S. prison system, and the investigation into Brooks' death is expected to be a focal point for ongoing debates about systemic violence and racial injustice .","Robert Brooks, a Black inmate serving a 12-year sentence for assault, was brutally beaten by multiple prison guards.

China's assertive stance

Taiwan's stand

Taiwan's ministry of national defence (MND) reported the operation of seven Chinese military aircraft and five naval vessels near its territory early Saturday, as tensions in the Taiwan Strait persist.""Seven PLA aircraft and five PLAN vessels operating around Taiwan were detected up until 6 am (UTC+8) today. One of the aircraft crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's northern Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). We have monitored the situation and responded accordingly,"" the MND stated on X.This marks a continuation of increased Chinese military activity in the region, following reports of similar operations in the preceding days. On Friday, Taiwan's MND noted the presence of five Chinese aircraft and five naval vessels, and on Thursday, five PLAN vessels were detected operating near the island.The Taiwan Strait remains a focal point of geopolitical tensions. Japan, a close neighbour and key ally of Taiwan, has expressed concern over the rising military activities in the region. Japanese foreign minister Iwaya Takeshi, in a meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Wednesday, reiterated the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, emphasising its critical role in regional and global security.Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte also voiced criticism of China’s actions, accusing Beijing of “bullying Taiwan” and seeking control of critical infrastructure in ways that could destabilise societies. He highlighted China's expanding military capabilities, including its nuclear arsenal, as a cause for global concern.“We need to be clear-eyed about China's ambitions. China is substantially building up its forces, including its nuclear weapons with no transparency and no limitations. From 200 warheads in 2020, China is expected to have more than 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030,"" Rutte said.China views Taiwan as an integral part of its territory and has not ruled out using force to achieve reunification. Chinese military activities around Taiwan have been a consistent point of contention, with Beijing justifying its actions as necessary to safeguard national sovereignty and counter what it perceives as foreign interference, particularly from the United States.In response to recent US military aid and arms sales to Taiwan, China imposed sanctions on seven American companies. The Chinese foreign ministry denounced the arms deals as violations of bilateral agreements and interference in China's domestic affairs.Taiwan has consistently condemned China's military manoeuvres, asserting its right to self-defence and sovereignty. Officials argue that such actions threaten regional peace and disrupt international trade routes.The island has garnered support from the US and other democratic allies, who advocate for maintaining the status quo and opposing unilateral changes through force.","Taiwan's ministry of national defence (MND) reported the operation of seven Chinese military aircraft and five naval vessels near its territory.

However, he previously said that nearly 3,000 North Korean soldiers had been ""killed or wounded"" while supporting Russia’s military, particularly in the western Kursk border region, where Ukraine launched a surprise incursion in August.South Korea's spy agency had earlier estimated the number of North Korean casualties at 1,000, attributing the high death toll to unfamiliar battlefield conditions and an inability to defend against drone attacks. The White House corroborated these figures on Friday, with officials describing North Korean troops as being sent on futile missions by Russian generals who view them as ""expendable.""National Security Council spokesman John Kirby added that some North Korean soldiers have reportedly taken their own lives rather than face capture, fearing potential reprisals against their families in North Korea.In recent days, North Korea and Russia have deepened their military ties following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.A significant defence agreement between Pyongyang and Moscow, signed in June, took effect this month.

Canada Flagpoling Ban: Canada flagpoling policy 2024: Canada Ends Flagpoling for Work and Study Permits: Key Implications Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canada-ends-flagpoling-for-work-and-study-permits-what-it-means/articleshow/116657872.cms,"Representative image

Reasons behind ban

Limited exemptions

Citizens or permanent residents of the United States.

Professionals and technicians under free trade agreements with countries such as the United States, Mexico, Chile, Panama, Peru, Colombia, and South Korea.

Spouses or common-law partners of professionals under these agreements.

International truck drivers leaving Canada for work who held maintained status due to a timely renewal application.

Individuals with pre-existing CBSA appointments for permit processing.

Canada has officially ended the practice of flagpoling for work and study permits at its ports of entry.Effective from December 23 at 11.59 pm ET, foreign nationals holding temporary resident status in Canada must submit renewal applications through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) instead of re-entering Canada after briefly leaving for expedited immigration services, according to a statement by the Canada Border Services Agency .Flagpoling has long been used by temporary residents to bypass typical processing wait times for work and study permits. However, Canadian authorities now aim to streamline port operations and enhance border enforcement.“This change will enable us to further streamline activities at our ports of entry and allow Canadian and American border officers to focus on what they have been expertly trained to do – border enforcement,” public safety minister David McGuinty said in a statement, reported CBC News.Flagpoling has placed a significant burden on Canadian and American border services. Between April 1, 2023, and March 31, 2024, the CBSA processed over 69,300 flagpolers, primarily in regions like the Pacific, southern Ontario, and Quebec, according to CIC News.The CBSA emphasised that border services are intended for individuals entering Canada rather than those already in the country. Diverting resources for flagpolers has added congestion and hindered critical border enforcement activities.“A strong Canada-US relationship keeps people and goods moving safely while protecting both sides of the border,” immigration minister Marc Miller said, adding that the policy shift would enhance fairness, ease border congestion, and improve overall border efficiency.Certain groups will still qualify for port-of-entry processing under specific circumstances:Those who attempt to flagpole without meeting these criteria will be redirected to IRCC for their applications.The policy is likely part of a broader initiative to bolster Canada-US border security . The Liberal government's fall economic update allocated $1.3 billion over six years for measures like drones, helicopters, and improved monitoring of the shared border. The changes also come amid concerns over potential US tariffs.Flagpoling, once a viable option for expediting permits, is now phased out to prioritize border security and efficient management. Applicants are being urged to use IRCC’s online services for work or study permit renewals moving forward.","Canada has officially ended the practice of flagpoling for work and study permits at its ports of entry.Effective from December 23 at 11.59 pm ET, foreign nationals holding temporary resident status in Canada must submit renewal applications through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.

Victim identified; argument escalated to gunfire

Investigation underway, suspect sought

Recurring issue of illegal alcohol sales

Calls for increased patrols

A deadly shooting at an illegal ""shot house"" in Macon, Georgia, has left one man dead and six others injured, with local authorities highlighting the dangers of bootlegging operations . The incident occurred early Thursday morning at a residence on Macon's south side, marking the second fatal shooting at the location this year.Bibb County Sheriff ’s deputies reported that Jawasiki Deuventa Guyton, 34, succumbed to his injuries at a hospital. Another man remains in critical condition, while five other victims are expected to recover. Sheriff David Davis explained at a press conference that an argument among attendees escalated when someone pulled out a gun and began firing indiscriminately.“There was a mix of alcohol, guns, and tempers flaring, which is a dangerous and, in this case, deadly combination,” Davis said.Deputies are seeking to identify a suspect but have not yet released a name. While there were many witnesses, Davis noted that some are reluctant to cooperate due to their involvement in illegal activities or alcohol consumption. Investigators have a blurry image of a dark vehicle linked to the scene and are requesting additional photos or videos to aid the investigation.Authorities may also pursue charges against the property owner for permittingillegal alcohol sales . Sheriff Davis emphasized that the location had been targeted previously in efforts to crack down on bootlegging.The residence has a troubled history. A person was fatally shot at the same house in January, and deputies have been working to shut down “shot houses” in the neighborhood for over a year. In November 2023, multiple arrests were made at the site and another nearby residence. Although activity at the house subsided for several months, Davis confirmed that illegal alcohol sales had resumed in recent weeks.“It’s like playing Whac-A-Mole,” Davis remarked. “We shut it down in one place, and they pop up somewhere else.”The shooting has prompted calls for more visible police presence in the neighborhood. Jake Fincher, owner of a nearby business, told WMAZ-TV, “The more you see patrols, the less crime there is. Out of sight, out of mind doesn’t work.”Authorities continue their investigation as residents express concerns over recurring violence tied to illegal alcohol sales in the area.","Jawasiki Deuventa Guyton, 34, was killed in a shooting at an illegal ""shot house"" in Macon, Georgia.

Gruesome bodycam footage reveals handcuffed inmate fatally beaten by New York prison guards,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gruesome-bodycam-footage-reveals-handcuffed-inmate-fatally-beaten-by-new-york-prison-guards/articleshow/116724902.cms,"A gruesome body camera footage released by Attorney General Letitia James shows a handcuffed inmate, being brutally beaten by correction officers at Marcy Correctional Facility. The December 9 incident, now under investigation, left the inmate unconscious and stripped to his underwear in an examination room. He died due to his injuries the following day. Robert Brooks , 43, was serving a 12-year sentence for first-degree assault. The footage, captured by four body cameras, reveals three guards repeatedly punching, kicking, and stomping on him while others stood by.Blood streamed down the right side of Brooks’ swollen face as he endured the attack, which spanned approximately 30 minutes. At one point, a guard appeared to choke him before Brooks was left unconscious on an exam table.The Onondaga County medical examiner attributed Brooks’ death to asphyxia caused by neck compression. The videos, released without audio due to the cameras being in standby mode, were shared by Attorney General James during a press conference.In the conference on Friday, James said, “My deepest condolences to out to Mr. Brooks’ family,” adding “I do not take lightly the release of this video especially in the middle of the holiday season.”She said that it is her “duty” and “responsibility” to provide the video to the public.State corrections commissioner Daniel Martuscello III described the incident as “vulgar” and “inhumane,” adding that such acts “senselessly took a life.” He confirmed the suspension of 13 staff members without pay, while one employee has resigned.At Governor Kathy Hochul’s request, steps to terminate those involved are underway. Martuscello pledged systemic changes to prevent similar incidents, as per the New York Post.“This was a killing, and people will be held accountable,” Martuscello stated. “These individuals are not representative of the culture of DOCCS nor anything that DOCCS stands for.”Reverend Al Sharpton condemned the attack, calling for criminal charges. “These officers clearly acted as though they had the right to treat a handcuffed man with unimaginable cruelty,” Sharpton said.Meanwhile, concerns of unrest have arisen and increased security measures were implemented at Rikers Island after social media posts by the Gorilla Stone Bloods gang voiced support for Brooks. Law enforcement clarified that Brooks was not affiliated with the gang.The Attorney General’s office continues its investigation, with James meeting Brooks’ family to review the footage. “This senseless act of violence demands justice,” she affirmed.","The December 9 incident, now under investigation, left the inmate unconscious and stripped to his underwear in an examination room.

At least 10 people were killed and hundreds injured during the May 9 riots, while approximately 40 public buildings and military installations were damaged, including the Lahore corps commander’s House (Jinnah House) and Askari Tower in Lahore, the army’s general headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) office in Faisalabad, the Radio Pakistan building in Peshawar, a toll plaza on the Swat motorway, and a PAF base in Imran’s hometown of Mianwali.Imran and his party have called for a judicial probe into last year’s events, claiming that violence on May 9 was a “false flag” operation aimed at crushing PTI.

Convictions and legal process

May 9 Riots and aftermath

International outcry

Pakistan's response

Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots that targeted military sites and other facilities following the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan This brings the total number of convictions related to the unrest to 85, according to announcements from the military’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).Among those sentenced is Hassan Niazi , Khan’s nephew, who received a 10-year prison term for his alleged role in the attack on the Lahore Corps Commander’s residence, also known as Jinnah House.The ISPR stated that the Field General Court Martial handed down the sentences after reviewing evidence and ensuring due process. “Sequel to the announcement of the May 9 punishments... the Field General Court Martial has promulgated the punishments to the following remaining 60 culprits after examining all evidence, ensuring the provision of all legal rights to the convicts, completion of due process, and the appropriate legal proceedings,” the ISPR announced.The convicted individuals face sentences ranging from two to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment. They have the right to appeal the decisions under Pakistan's Constitution.The unrest on May 9 erupted after Imran Khan’s arrest in a corruption case. Supporters of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party allegedly attacked key military installations, including the Army General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, the Corps Commander’s House in Lahore, and an ISI office in Faisalabad.In response, authorities detained hundreds of individuals, and 103 were handed over to military courts for trial, sparking widespread criticism of the opaque judicial process.The convictions have drawn sharp rebukes from international entities, including the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union. Critics argue that the use of military courts to try civilians undermines judicial independence and transparency.“These military courts lack judicial independence, transparency, and due process guarantees,” the US State Department said. Similarly, the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCO) criticized the lack of transparency and independent oversight in the trials, emphasizing the importance of adhering to fair trial standards under international law.The European Union also expressed concern, highlighting that Pakistan’s actions contradict its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and commitments tied to the GSP+ trade program.The Pakistani government has defended the use of military courts, citing the Supreme Court’s decision that allowed the military to proceed with trials of civilians involved in the riots. The Foreign Office reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to international human rights obligations, asserting that the trials were conducted in accordance with national laws.The ISPR emphasized that the convictions reflect the military’s resolve to uphold justice and maintain the authority of the state, stating, “The Nation, Government, and Armed Forces remain steadfast in their commitment to upholding justice and ensuring that the inviolable writ of the state is maintained.”","Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots.

This has been the fourth time in the past few years that Pakistan has conducted airstrikes inside Afghanistan, and the second time since March 2024.“Last night (Tuesday), Pakistan bombarded four points in Barmal district of Paktika province. The total number of dead is 46, most of whom were children and women,” said Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesperson for the Afghan Taliban govt. He added that six others, mostly children, were wounded.Condemning the airstrikes, the Afghan defence ministry called them “barbaric” and a clear “aggression”. It stated that several refugees, including women and children, were killed and injured. “The Pakistani side should understand that such arbitrary measures are not a solution to any problem,” Enayatullah Khowarazami, spokesperson for Afghanistan’s defence ministry, wrote on social media platform ‘X’. “The Islamic Emirate (Afghan Taliban regime) will not leave this cowardly act unanswered, but rather considers the defence of its territory and sovereignty to be its inalienable right,” he added.The strikes took place hours after Pakistan special representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq met interim Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul, intending to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long gap. The deteriorating ties, however, are likely to worsen following Tuesday night’s airstrikes, analysts said.Pakistan alleges the Afghan government harbours armed groups, particularly the TTP, which conducts cross-border assaults against Pakistani security forces. In one of the worst recent assaults on security forces, the TTP had claimed responsibility for the killing of at least 16 Pakistani soldiers in South Waziristan last week.Kabul, however, denies providing shelter to armed groups or allowing their territory to be used for cross-border attacks.Border tensions between the two countries have surged since the Taliban regime took control in 2021, with Pakistan experiencing a revival of militant activity along its western border. Deadly air attacks by Pakistan’s military in Afghan border regions in March, which the Taliban claimed killed eight civilians, had sparked confrontations along the the disputed border between the two countries.","Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province.

He clarified that military courts only handle cases involving attacks on defence establishments, citing incidents such as the attack on the Corps Commander's House in Lahore.The minister also criticised the PTI for changing its stance regarding trials of civilians in the military courts, recalling that during Khan's tenure, military court trials were praised.""The statements praising the military courts from PTI's leadership are still available on social media. Yet now, the same individuals are lobbying internationally against these courts,"" Tarar said.He assured that military trials adhere to fair trial principles and dismissed claims of injustice in military trials.The military courts tasked to hear cases of suspects involved in the attacks on military facilities on the May 9, 2023 protest last week sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from 2-10 years.Khan's party criticized the verdicts, arguing that military courts have no jurisdiction over civilians.",Information minister Attaullah Tarar says military courts are competent to deal with cases related to attacks on army facilities.

Tensions have grown since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021, with Pakistan accusing Kabul of harbouring militants responsible for attacks on Pakistani soil. Kabul has denied the allegations.The latest strike follows a recent raid claimed by the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) near the Afghan border, which Islamabad intelligence said killed 16 soldiers.On the same day as the air strikes, high-ranking Taliban officials were meeting with Pakistan's special envoy for Afghanistan in Kabul.

Pakistan has repeatedly accused the Afghan Taliban of providing shelter to TTP fighters, who have increased attacks on Pakistani forces in recent months. In response, the Afghan Taliban denies these allegations, asserting that civilians, not militants, were targeted in the latest strikes.“The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan considers this a brutal act against all international principles and blatant aggression and strongly condemns it,” said the Afghan ministry of defence. “The Islamic Emirate will not leave this cowardly act unanswered but rather considers the defense of its territory to be its inalienable right.”Islamabad contends that many TTP leaders and fighters have fled to Afghanistan, finding refuge in border provinces under Taliban protection. Afghan officials, however, have refuted these claims, stating that the victims of the bombings were primarily displaced civilians.The strikes came just after Mohammad Sadiq, Pakistan’s special representative for Afghanistan, visited Kabul for discussions on trade and bilateral relations. The timing has fueled speculation about a deterioration in diplomatic ties between the two neighbors.The TTP, which ended a ceasefire with the Pakistani government in November 2022, has intensified its attacks on Pakistani security forces.

It is just intended for deterrence purposes and nothing else,” Sharif told cabinet members during a meeting.Noting that his foreign affairs ministry had given a “comprehensive response” to Washington on the matter, Sharif said, “This programme is not mine, nor any political party’s; it belongs to the 240 million people of this country, and it is dear to them. There will be no compromise on this programme, and the entire nation is united on this issue.”According to a US state department factsheet, the Islamabad-based NDC had sought to obtain components for Pakistan’s long-range ballistic-missile programme and missile-testing equipment.

However, during their indictment, they pleaded guilty and requested to record their confessional statements. Judge Tanveer Ahmad Sheikh ensured the accused understood the implications of their confessions, allowing them 30 minutes to reconsider before recording their statements.Nazia Naheed, a former stewardess from Karachi, admitted to using a fake BA degree to gain a promotion.

This decision has heightened concerns among Khan’s supporters that military courts may increasingly handle cases tied to the former leader.The US State Department expressed ""deep concern"" over the verdicts, stating, ""deeply concerned that Pakistani civilians have been sentenced by a military tribunal for their involvement in protests on May 9, 2023.""Similarly, the British foreign office raised issues of fairness, saying, ""trying civilians in military courts lacks transparency, independent scrutiny and undermines the right to a fair trial.""The European Union echoed these concerns, noting the sentences were ""inconsistent with the obligations that Pakistan has undertaken under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.""The protests erupted after Khan’s arrest by paramilitary forces, during which his supporters targeted military installations. The military court ruling came on Saturday, just days after Khan was indicted by an anti-terrorism court.Khan, who was briefly released after his May 2023 arrest, was detained again in August and has remained in jail since. He faces numerous legal cases after being ousted as prime minister in 2022. Following his removal, he launched a protest movement against the coalition government led by current Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.Khan has claimed the cases against him, which disqualify him from contesting the 2024 elections, are politically motivated. He attributes his downfall to a rift with the military, which he accuses of orchestrating his ousting.While candidates backed by Khan secured the most seats in recent elections, his rivals formed a coalition government. Meanwhile, a United Nations human rights working group has stated that Khan's detention breaches international law.The Pakistani military denies any political interference, and the government insists its treatment of Khan and his supporters has been fair. The Pakistani embassy in Washington has not commented on the matter.",25 civilians were sentenced to between two and ten years for attacks on military facilities during protests in 2023 following the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan. The decision has heightened concerns among Khan’s supporters that military courts may increasingly handle cases tied to the former leader.

Copying Cirus

MUMBAI: A little-known incident in the history of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme is a purported attempt made by the country in the early ’70s to copy the design of India’s Cirus reactor — a 40 MW thermal neutron research facility, which first achieved criticality at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Trombay, near Mumbai, on July 10, 1960. An acronym for Canada India Reactor Utility Services, Cirus was constructed with Canadian assistance at a shared cost of $14.14 million, according to news reports.Pakistan’s attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H. Khan , a man who played a role in the neighbouring country’s nuclear weapons programme. In his book “Eating Grass: The Making Of The Pakistani Bomb”, published in 2012 by the Stanford University Press, Feroz wrote, “Munir Ahmed Khan, later chairman of the PAEC [Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission], recalled that in October 1965 he had met Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto [the then Pakistan foreign minister] in Vienna. Munir explained to him that he had been to India’s Cirus facility at Trombay in 1964 and saw for himself that India was well on its way to making the [nuclear] bomb. Bhutto asked Munir to meet Ayub Khan in December during Ayub’s upcoming visits to the United Kingdom and the United States and try to convince the president of the urgency of a weapons programme.” The country eventually carried out its first nuclear weapons tests on May 28 and 30, 1998.Feroz’s disclosure, though now 12 years old, assumes immediate significance in the context of the US last week announcing fresh sanctions on Pakistan’smissile development programme. For the first time, the measures target Pakistan’s state-run National Development Complex, for its role in the country’s mission development programme. US deputy NSA Jon Finer has said, “Pakistan has developed increasingly sophisticated missile technology… If these trends continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States.”Feroz’s writing about the Cirus reactor is important because the plutonium for India’s Smiling Buddha project — the country’s first nuclear weapons test at Pokhran on May 18, 1974 — was from this reactor.According to Feroz, “Pakistani leadership wanted the rights to copy technological designs for its indigenous programme without incurring penalties and while remaining on the ‘good side’ of the international system.” He recalled: “While work to commission KANUPP [Karachi Nuclear Power Complex] went on, Munir Ahmed Khan said that there would be a secret team headed by a nuclear official, Sardar Ali Khan, to work on replicating India’s Cirus reactor.The author quotes Pervez Butt, who was purportedly part of the secret “copying’’ team and was chairman of PAEC between 2001 and 2005, as telling him, “Our team worked tirelessly, I did the mechanical part. When we merged our work and presented, Munir Khan could not believe it.”Feroz, however, has questioned Pakistan’s decision to copy the design of the Cirus reactor because there were some fundamental differences between Cirus and Kanupp.The team had modified the basic Cirus design.","Pakistan's attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H. Khan. Cirus was constructed with Canadian assistance at a shared cost of $14.14 million. Pakistan eventually carried out its first nuclear weapons tests on May 28 and 30, 1998.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116608587,imgsize-760319,width-400,resizemode-4/116608587.jpg"
Pakistan government forms committee to negotiate with jailed former premier Imran Khan's party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-government-forms-committee-to-negotiate-with-jailed-former-premier-imran-khans-party/articleshow/116570205.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Shehbaz Sharif-led Pakistan government on Sunday formed a negotiation committee to start formal talks with jailed former prime minister Imran Khan 's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party after it threatened to give a call for civil disobedience.According to a government statement, the committee includes deputy Prime Minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, the prime minister's political aide Rana Sanaullah, education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, minister for privatisation Aleem Khan, minister for religious affairs Chaudhry Salik Hussain and Senator Irfan Siddiqui among others.The PTI welcomed the formation of the government committee for negotiations, calling it a ""positive step"".""We consider the committee's formation a constructive step. Meaningful dialogue based on positive intentions should be held,"" PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said.He stressed that the potential talks should have a defined timeframe, adding that the dialogue must progress positively considering the sensitivity of the situation.National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq had taken the lead by offering on Wednesday that he was ready to host the two sides and facilitate their parleys.He welcomed the newly constituted committee and invited the government and opposition for talks, saying ""the speaker's office is always open for members"", according to a statement issued by the NA Secretariat.The speaker called on members of both committees to meet on Monday morning, adding that he would meet them at his chambers in Parliament House.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram said his party accepted the speaker's invitation to meet. He said their committee will attend the meeting on Monday.Akram said the PTI founder will be informed about the progress of the meeting and he will decide whether to cancel the civil disobedience movement .The talks are being held after the PTI had threatened to give a call for civil disobedience.The party posted on X from the account of the jailed former prime minister regarding the call for civil disobedience movement, which was initially shared on December 19, stating that the campaign will be launched if the government doesn't make progress on the party's demands by Sunday.""I had presented two demands to the government, the release of under-trial political prisoners and the establishment of a judicial commission for a transparent investigation into the events of May 9, 2023 and November 26, 2024,"" the post quoted PTI founder Khan. It further stated that both of these demands ""are legitimate"".""If the government fails to take any action on them by Sunday, the first phase of the civil disobedience movement - 'remittance boycott' - will be launched,"" it said.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram also reiterated that the civil disobedience drive would be launched tomorrow (Monday) if the party's demands go unmet.However, the issue of civil disobedience has been apparently put on hold for some time while allowing the two sides to address the differences through political means.Khan, 72, on December 5 had warned of a civil disobedience movement from December 14 if his demands about the release of political prisoners facing trial and the formation of a judicial commission to probe the events of May 9, 2023, and November 26 this year were unmet.Meanwhile, Pakistan's military courts sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for attacking military installations during riots which erupted following the arrest of Khan in May last year, the Army announced on Saturday.On May 9, 2023, Khan's PTI supporters allegedly attacked several military installations, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi and the ISI building in Faisalabad, to vent their anger against the arrest of their party founder in a corruption case.Hundreds of suspects were arrested in the countrywide swoop and at least 103 were handed over to the military authorities for trial due to their involvement in attacks on military installations.Khan's party has launched multiple protests through 2023 and 2024 demanding the release of their supreme leader, the latest being in November 2024.The former prime minister, currently lodged at the Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, was arrested in August last year and faces multiple cases since his government was toppled in April 2022.","The committee includes deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, the prime minister's political aide Rana Sanaullah, education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, minister for privatisation Aleem Khan.

"1,566 terror attacks killed 924 in Pakistan over past 10 months",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/1566-terror-attacks-killed-924-in-pakistan-over-past-10-months/articleshow/116551393.cms,"KARACHI: Ten years have passed since Ajoon Khan's son died in a ghastly attack by the Pakistani Taliban that killed about 150 people, mostly children, at a military-run school in Peshawar, in northwestern Pakistan. But the pain of loss is unrelenting - it grows only deeper with time. Khan, a lawyer, said he could never forget the parents sobbing and pleading outside the school gates.The brutal assault on the school in Peshawar led to rare political unity in support of a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy for Pakistan and a vast military operation in the country's former tribal areas near Afghanistan. The efforts forced militants to retreat across the border and brought a degree of relative peace to Pakistan. Large-scale terrorist attacks were significantly reduced, with fatalities dropping from 2,451 across 1,717 attacks in 2013 to 220 in 146 attacks in 2020. But the hard-won gains are now in jeopardy.Over the past few years, violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan. Experts attribute the increase to the Afghan Taliban's seizure of power in neighbouring Afghanistan in Aug 2021.Last week, the interior ministry reported that 924 people, including civilians and law enforcement personnel, had been killed in 1,566 terrorist attacks across the country over the past 10 months. It said 341 terrorists had been killed during the period.Early on Saturday, sixteen soldiers were killed in northwest Pakistan in an attack by Islamist militants, a senior police official in the South Waziristan region said. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistan Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack, giving a higher figure for the number of personnel killed, Reuters reported.Experts and security officials have identified a range of challenges impeding Pakistan's progress against terrorism: political instability, weak governance, dwindling public support, economic constraints and reduced US counterterrorism assistance after the end of the 20-year war in Afghanistan.""The greatest challenge lies in mobilising the necessary financial resources and manpower for operations across such vast regions,"" said Muhammad Amir Rana, director of the Pak Institute for Peace Studies, a security think tank in Islamabad. The source of the problem for Pakistan, experts say, is found across the border, in Afghanistan.The Taliban administration in Kabul, the Afghan capital, denies accusations of harbouring militants from TTP. But Asfandyar Mir, a senior expert at the United States Institute of Peace, said the TTP had been given ""a permissive safe haven in Afghanistan,"" which had allowed it to become ""resilient and lethal.""Pakistani security officials privately acknowledged that they had misjudged how the new Taliban rulers of Afghanistan would handle TTP. The officials had anticipated that the Taliban leaders would help curb the TTP in return for the covert support that Pakistan had provided them during the US-led war. Instead, the Taliban in Kabul have provided the TTP with resources and advanced American-made weapons and equipment seized after the collapse of the US-supported Afghan govt, according to a senior security official in Islamabad who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The TTP has gone on to unleash a wave of attacks inside Pakistan as it wages a campaign whose aim is to overthrow the govt. Among them was a suicide bombing in January 2023 that killed over 100 people at a mosque in Peshawar.Pakistani security forces have also been locked in a conflict with ethnic separatist groups in Balochistan, an arid province bordering Afghanistan and Iran that is home to the Chinese-run port Gwadar. nyt","Violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan.
