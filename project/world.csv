AGRA: A 14-year-old boy from Hathras in UP died hours after doctors at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital — in a complex and gruelling surgery that lasted almost five hours — removed about 65 objects , including batteries, chains, razor blade fragments and screws, from the child's stomach.“Aditya Sharma was brought to Safdarjung Hospital where doctors found all those objects in his stomach. He died due to an intestinal infection ,” said an official at the hospital on Saturday, adding, “He must have swallowed these objects in the past”. His father, Sanchet Sharma, a medical representative at a pharma firm in Hathras, said Aditya started complaining of shortness of breath and discomfort on Oct 13, prompting a visit to a hospital in Agra. His parents, in the next two weeks, took him to medical facilities in four cities — Jaipur, Aligarh, Noida and Delhi — with the hope of a proper diagnosis and cure. “But Aditya died on the night of Oct 28. All of this happened within a month... He never had any physical or mental ailments in the past,” said Sharma, who lives in Ratnagarbha colony.Aditya was Sharma’s only son. After their visit to the Agra hospital, the Class 9 student was referred to a hospital in Jaipur where following scans and tests he came back to UP on Oct 19. Two days later, Aditya’s breathing difficulties resurfaced and his parents rushed him to a hospital in Aligarh. There, a CT scan found a “nasal blockage”, which the doctors successfully removed, Sharma said.“However, Aditya started having abdominal pain and on Oct 26 after an extensive ultrasound test in Aligarh, it was found that there were 19 objects stuck inside his stomach. He was immediately referred to a private hospital in Noida, and we took him there the same day. In Noida, doctors found 42 objects in the stomach and called for urgent medical attention,” he added. Aditya was subsequently moved to Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, where a scan identified a “total of 65 objects”, and the boy’s “heart beat raced up to 280 per minute”, the family said.","Aditya Sharma was brought to Safdarjung Hospital where doctors found all those objects in his stomach.

Nate Silver on Selzer Iowa polls

Last night's polling out of Iowa threw the conservatives into a shock as the Ann Selzer polling projected Kamala Harris ahead in the ruby-red state. Donald Trump won Iowa in both 2016 and 2020 and the polling in which he was 3 percentage points behind Kamala Harris rattled the former president too. He called the polling fake and Ann Selzer a Trump-hater.""No President has done more for FARMERS, and the Great State of Iowa, than Donald J. Trump. In fact, it’s not even close! All polls, except for one heavily skewed toward the Democrats by a Trump hater who called it totally wrong the last time, have me up, BY A LOT. I LOVE THE FARMERS, AND THEY LOVE ME. THE JUST OUT EMERSON POLL HAS ME UP 10 POINTS IN IOWA. THANK YOU!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.The poll, conducted by Selzer & Co for the Des Moines Register and Mediacom, was released Saturday. It found that 47 per cent of Iowa voters supported Harris and 44 per cent supported Trump. The Emerson College poll also released on Saturday gave Trump a 9-point lead.In an email to Newsweek, Ann Selzer said: ""These are the kinds of comments seen for virtually any poll, including mine. The Des Moines Register includes a methodology statement with each story they publish. It's the same methodology used to show Trump winning Iowa in the final polls in 2016 and 2020. It would not be in my best interest, or that of my clients—The Des Moines Register and Mediacom—to conjure fake numbers.""Selzer's poll surveyed 808 likely Iowa voters between October 28 and 31. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 point, which Harris' lead is within.Nate Silver said Selzer has a history of being right but this time she is probably wrong. ""Releasing this poll took an incredible amount of guts because — let me state this as carefully as I can — if you had to play the odds, this time Selzer will probably be wrong. Harris’s chances of winning Iowa nearly doubled in our model from 9 percent to 17 percent tonight, which isn’t nothing. Polymarket shows a similar trend, moving from 6 percent to 18 percent after the survey. But that still places Harris’s odds at around 5:1 against,"" Silver wrote.","The poll, conducted by Selzer & Co for the Des Moines Register and Mediacom, was released Saturday.

In an MSNBC interview, Emhoff said he talks to young men about the real side of Donald Trump, not the 'dancing, going to the wrestling match' Donald Trump. ""I think Cardi B called this out that it's all hustle."" The Democrat presidential candidate's husband said his appeal to the young men is to do their research.""He (Trump) is not your friend. The policies that he is talking about will not help them in the economy. The policies that he's talking about have nothing to do with them. So they might think he's great, he's cool. But I talked to a mom of an 18-year-old. She was nervous and worried that he and his friends are all taken by this side of Trump . She told him just go online, listen to him, listen to his speeches...not the podcast, not him at the wrestling matches or the UFC. Just listen to his speeches, watch him and then look at her (Harris) and watch her.

Iron Beam: Israel's 'new era of warfare' defence system to use high-power lasers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iron-beam-israels-new-era-of-warfare-defence-system-to-use-high-power-lasers/articleshow/114870623.cms,"How does 'Iron Beam' work?

Israel's advanced "" Iron Beam "" laser defense system is anticipated to be operational in the next year strengthening its defense system, reports CNN citing Israel’s defense ministry. Israel invested over $500 million this week in contracts with domestic defense companies Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Elbit Systems to enhance the shield's production.The Iron Beam, developed alongside the Iron Dome, is designed to neutralize various aerial threats including missiles, drones, rockets, and mortars, according to Israel's defense ministry.Israeli officials have claimed that the development will bring a ""a new era of warfare"" as the nation confronts drone and missile threats from Iran and its allies.""It heralds the beginning of a new era in warfare. The initial capability of the ground-based laser system… is expected to enter operational service within one year,"" said Eyal Zamir, director general of the defense ministry, in a recent announcement.The system's prototype was first shown in 2021, and development has continued steadily since then.These developments occur as Israel maintains military operations in Gaza and Lebanon, following recent direct missile exchanges with Iran.Military analysts indicate that the Iron Beam could strengthen Israel's defensive capabilities while potentially reducing operational costs.A ground-based high-power laser system operates by targeting and heating vulnerable components of projectiles, such as engines or warheads, from distances ranging from hundreds of meters to several kilometers until they fail.This approach differs with Israel's current missile defense strategy, which relies on radar detection followed by launching interceptor missiles to neutralize incoming threats in the air.Defense experts indicate that a laser-based defense system would provide superior performance to the Iron Dome while being more cost-effective and responsive.According to Yehoshua Kalisky from the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, each Iron Dome interception requires two missiles, with individual missiles costing approximately $50,000 or more.The ongoing conflict with Israel's northern neighbor has necessitated frequent interceptions. The IDF reported that on Tuesday alone, approximately 50 projectiles entered Israeli territory from southern Lebanon, with only partial interception success.The company developing Iron Beam, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, said that laser interceptions have ""almost zero cost per interception.""Experts indicate that the laser system would particularly excel at countering drones, which have proven challenging for the Iron Dome to intercept.While the Iron Dome effectively counters rockets and missiles, it struggles with drones due to their small size, light weight, and minimal radar signature. Unlike missiles, drones can alter their flight paths and are harder for radar systems to detect.However, weather conditions pose significant limitations for the Iron Beam, as clouds, rain, and haze reduce its atmospheric penetration and target acquisition capabilities. The system also requires substantial power resources for operation.Various nations have developed different laser defense systems. The US Navy has tested high-powered lasers capable of destroying aircraft, while the UK has introduced DragonFire for aerial defense. According to the Pentagon, both China and Russia are working on satellite-targeting laser technology.Iran's status regarding indigenous laser defense systems remains uncertain. In 2022, Iranian state media reported the country's claimed ability to ""manufacture laser weapons to defend sensitive regions.""Reports suggest Iran may possess the Chinese-manufactured ""Silent Hunter"" laser weapon, though experts indicate it's less powerful than the planned Iron Beam system.","Israel's advanced "" Iron Beam "" laser defense system is anticipated to be operational in the next year strengthening its defense system.

Vice President Kamala Harris refrained from disclosing her stance on a significant California ballot measure aimed at reversing recent criminal justice reforms whilst campaigning in Michigan. She confirmed that her mail-in ballot was en route to California, two days before Election Day.""I am not going to talk about the vote on that. Because honestly it's the Sunday before the election and I don't intend to create an endorsement one way or another around it,"" said Harris, who previously served as San Francisco district attorney, California attorney general and US senator prior to her 2020 vice presidential election.The proposed measure would classify repeat shoplifting offences as felonies and strengthen penalties for certain drug-related charges , including those involving fentanyl. Additionally, it would empower judges to mandate treatment for individuals with multiple drug offences.Supporters argue that the initiative addresses crucial gaps in current legislation that have hindered law enforcement's ability to effectively prosecute shoplifters and drug dealers.Democratic state officials and social justice advocates oppose the measure, arguing it would unfairly imprison economically disadvantaged individuals and those struggling with substance use, rather than targeting the organisers who employ groups to steal goods for online resale.Crime management has become a central focus in California's current election cycle.San Francisco Mayor London Breed faces re-election challenges from opponents who criticise her city management.Simultaneously, Alameda County district attorney Pamela Price confronts a recall election, while Los Angeles district attorney George Gascón competes against a challenger who questions his progressive approach to crime and punishment.According to the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, data indicates consistent increases in shoplifting across San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles between 2021 and 2022.Statewide shoplifting rates increased during this period but remained below pre-pandemic 2019 levels, whilst commercial burglaries and robberies have become more frequent in urban counties, as per the study.","Kamala Harris confirmed that her mail-in ballot was en route to California, two days before Election Day.

Kamala Harris Vs Donald Trump Prediction: New polls say Trump leading Harris in every swing state amid shock Iowa finding in US election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-polls-say-trump-leading-harris-in-every-swing-state-amid-shock-iowa-finding-in-us-election/articleshow/114917698.cms,"Selzer poll says Kamala Harris ahead in Iowa, another poll says Donald Trump winning in all seven swing states.

Aftermath of the shock poll in Iowa

A new poll from AtlasIntel claimed former president Donald Trump is leading vice president Kamala Harris in each of the seven swing states though the margin is narrow. Trump is favored to win in North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The new poll comes amid Ann Selzer poll sent shockwaves that Kamala Harris is ahead in Iowa which is a reliably conservative turf that Donald Trump won both in 2016 and 2020.The AtlasIntel survey said Trump is holding the widest margin in Arizona -- with a 52.3 per cent to Harris 45.8 per cent.In Nevada, Trump has a 51.2 per cent to 46 per cent edge over Harris.In North Carolina, Trump holds a 50.5 per cent to 47.1 per cent lead.In Georgia, Trump is leading 50.1 per cent to Harris' 47.6 per cent.In Michigan, it's 49.7 per cent for Trump and 48.2 per cent for Harris.In Pennsylvania, the projection is 49.6 per cent for Trump and 47.8 per cent for Harris.Wisconsin is the closest -- 49.7 per cent for Trump and 48.6 per cent for Harris.A Des Moines Register Iowa poll claimed Kamala Harris is three points up in Iowa mostly because of the women voters. “It’s hard for anybody to say they saw this coming,” Selzer told the newspaper. “She (Harris) has clearly leaped into a leading position.” Selzer and the Register surveyed 808 likely Iowa voters from Oct. 28 to Oct. 31. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Harris’ lead in the poll is the result of a massive gender gap. She leads by 20 points among women, 56% to 36%. Trump has a lead among men, but it’s relatively smaller, 52% to 38%. It’s a pattern that’s repeated itself to varying extents nationwide, but notably, a six-week abortion ban went into effect in Iowa this summer.Daily Beast report said after the shock poll, betting markets tilted towards Kamala Harris. Kalshi's betting market on Saturday gave Trump a 55 per cent chance of winning on Saturday but on Sunday morning that fell to 50 per cent.On Polymark, Trump was at 63 per cent on Saturday but on Sunday morning, he tumbled down to 56 per cent.

Pittsburgh 'Hamas operative' arrested for vandalising Jewish buildings; donations to Squad Democrats revealed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pittsburgh-hamas-operative-arrested-for-vandalising-jewish-buildings-donations-to-squad-democrats-revealed/articleshow/114917439.cms,"This is a representational image (Pic credit: Canva)

The FBI and Pittsburgh police apprehended two local residents on Wednesday, charging them with hate crimes for allegedly vandalising Jewish buildings in July.One suspect, Mohamad Hamad, who claimed to be a "" Hamas operative"", was found to be a Pennsylvania Air National Guard member based near Pittsburgh International Airport. According to the criminal complaint, he had purchased and tested explosive materials for a potential attack.The dual US-Lebanese citizen had made donations to Squad Democrats who have labelled Israel's military response in Gaza as genocide and advocated for restricting US arms supplies to Israel during its conflict with Iran and its allied militant groups.His alleged Jewish accomplice, Talya Lubit, was charged for helping spray pro-Hamas graffiti on Jewish facilities. She had described Jews as ""enemies"" and supported a contentious cease-fire resolution against Israel. She also joined others in defending Pittsburgh's Representative Summer Lee, who recently attributed blame to Israel for the 7 October Hamas attack.Jeremy Kazzaz, who leads the Beacon Coalition, an organisation combating antisemitism in politics, told The Post, ""In Pittsburgh, we've seen an infiltration of the Democratic Party by anti-Israel extremists who frequently target the Jewish community.""These serious charges emerge amid growing concerns about antisemitism, following attacks on three Jewish University of Pittsburgh students this term, and with 62% of Jewish Americans expressing worry about antisemitism within the Democratic Party.""Imagine the terror they saw if they had cams. Hamas operative ripping off their flags in white suburbia,"" Hamad, from Coraopolis near Pittsburgh, communicated to an FBI-known contact via Signal.This encrypted platform is comparable to Telegram, which Hamas members utilised to distribute footage of their 7 October attack, when over 2,000 armed militants invaded southern Israel, resulting in more than 1,400 casualties and hostages.Hamad expressed his desire for martyrdom through Signal messages.He shared what appeared to be a self-portrait wearing a green Hamas-logoed headband and black sweatshirt stating ""RESPECT EXISTENCE OR EXPECT RESISTANCE"", writing, ""my heart yearns for being with my brothers overseas.""Records indicate his purchase of Indian Black aluminium powder and potassium perchlorate, both explosive components.Communications reveal Hamad's plans to test a ""big shell"" on 6 July as preparation for a future explosion, and his enthusiasm over footage showing ""what appears to be the detonation of an explosive device and corresponding fireball,"" according to FBI Special Agent Brian Collins.Kazzaz expressed concern that Hamad might have been planning an attack on Pittsburgh's Jewish community after reviewing the criminal complaint.Hamad coordinated with Lubit, a Jewish activist from Pittsburgh's Oakland area, about defacing Jewish buildings. Subsequently, red graffiti appeared at Chabad of Squirrel Hill on 29 July, displaying ""Jews 4 Palestine"" and an inverted triangle, a symbol Hamas uses to mark Israeli targets in Gaza.Similar vandalism occurred at the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, with the message ""Funds Genocide Jews, Hate Zionists.""Lubit appeared to grapple with her Jewish identity alongside her anti-Israel stance.""I can literally feel myself starting to see Jews as my enemies,"" the Dickinson College graduate messaged Hamad before the vandalism. Under the alias ""Warsaw"", she shared an image of Israel's flag with a Nazi swastika in a group chat, according to the complaint.""Every day I think, 'I don't want to be Jewish anymore,'"" she told Hamad, describing it as conflicting with ""being anti-oppression.""Kazzaz noted this oppressor-versus-oppressed perspective ""led to a radicalisation of two people from very different backgrounds"" resulting in vandalism and Hamad's attempts to acquire explosive materials.He suggested Democratic officials have heightened risks through anti-Israel rhetoric.""The way that Summer Lee views the world and has used her bully pulpit has legitimised these extremists,"" Kazzaz said regarding the congresswoman who describes Israel's defensive war as ""genocide"" whilst advocating resistance.""That allows them in some perverse way to justify acts of terrorism against random, innocent people,"" he added.""Jews are always viewed as the oppressor in this binary.""Both suspects maintain connections to anti-Israel politics and Squad Democrats.Hamad contributed $10 to Representative Ilhan Omar in November 2023, following her call for an Israeli cease-fire on 7 October. He also donated $5 to Representative Rashida Tlaib in April, after her censure for characterising Hamas' attack as ""resistance"" against Israel's ""apartheid government.""Lubit joined over 130 Jewish community members signing a letter supporting Lee, who demanded a cease-fire shortly after 7 October, despite appeals from 40 Pittsburgh Jewish leaders for solidarity with Israel and Jews.Harris campaign staff member Sam Wasserman also endorsed the letter, alongside others who later backed a county council resolution demanding immediate cease-fire and release of all Palestinian prisoners, including known militants, in exchange for Hamas-held hostages.""If this is a war, it did not start on October 7,"" Lubit said in March, advocating for the resolution that failed but gained support from three Democratic council members, prefiguring similar statements by Lee, Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey and Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato attributing the 7 October attack to Israel.""This is the dangerous situation that many of us in the situation have been trying to convey to elected officials and our neighbours, that the use of violent rhetoric, the misuse of language, and the leaning on age-old antisemitic tropes makes us and our community less safe,"" Kazzaz stated.He criticised Democrats for prioritising pro-Palestinian voters over safety concerns, enabling anti-Israel voices within the party.Despite Senator Bob Casey's criticism of Lee's statement about Israel's responsibility for the deadliest day since the Holocaust, he maintains his endorsement, causing Jewish Democrats to consider supporting Republican candidate Dave McCormick.""When [Democrats] are putting party over country, they are sweeping these dangers under the rug. And these arrests are a reflection of that,"" Kazzaz said.""Jewish hatred can actually morph into actually dangerous situations and violence.""","Mohamad Hamad, a dual US-Lebanese citizen, claimed to be a ""Hamas operative"" Hamad purchased and tested explosive materials for a potential attack. His alleged Jewish accomplice, Talya Lubit, was charged for helping spray pro-Hamas graffiti.

6) Sympathy for the Devil

Nate Cohn, the chief political analyst of, recently wrote a piece titledHe argued, “How is Mr. Trump still so competitive? The simplest answer is that the national political environment just isn’t as conducive to a Democratic victory as many might imagine.” Among the reasons Cohn gave for the Democratic Party’s inability to beat Trump—within the confines of the availability heuristic that exists in American mainstream media—he cites public dissatisfaction with Biden’s leadership, disenchantment with the Democrats on most issues barring democracy and abortion, post-pandemic economic challenges, and the Democrats giving up their own progressive agenda.No one thought it would be this close two days before election day or predicted Trump’s renaissance. Two years ago, Trump appeared to be a lost cause, on the verge of being disqualified, fighting numerous criminal cases, and even rejected by the Republican establishment, which seemed to have found a new knight in shining armour in Ron DeSantis. The New York Post, which recently endorsed Trump, had buried the news about Trump’s re-election bid deep inside. Now, Trump is powerful enough in the Republican establishment to reject Rupert Murdoch’s VP pick and instead chose JD Vance after being convinced by Elon Musk, David Sacks, and Tucker Carlson.As of 2 November, Harris led by exactly one point, according to FiveThirtyEight’s poll of polls, meaning nearly half the country is openly admitting that it is backing Donald Trump . So, how did it get so close?There are, like life, various variables. Here are the top ten:In 2016, when Trump came to power, mainstream American media enjoyed a “Trump Bump,” with readers more engaged with mainstream media, leading to a rise in circulation, subscriptions, and ratings for all mainstream channels. Yet, thundering follows the laws of diminishing returns, and viewers started noticing the dissonance between reality and MSM’s coverage of Trump.Consider how outlets chose to report claims that Donald Trump had threatened to shoot Liz Cheney. What he did say, in making a point about Cheney being a war hawk, was, “She’s a war hawk, let’s see how she likes war if you give her a rifle and she’s got nine barrels shooting at her. They’re all war hawks when they’re sitting in Washington saying let’s send 10,000 troops to fight the enemy.”Despite being the subject of two assassination attempts and a disinformation campaign by several agents, including Iran , MSM’s “Trump Derangement Syndrome” has prevented it from covering Trump in a cogent way.With MSM failing to cover the whole picture, new media has emerged that asks people to look at Trump on his own merits. This includes X, owned by Trump ally Elon Musk, who has amplified various MAGA talking points. Trump’s podcast appearances on shows like The Joe Rogan Experience and The Flagrant Podcast have also helped dispel labels such as fascist, bigot, and racist that have been thrust upon him.When Trump speaks, he sounds like a regular human being, and while evil can be banal, the fascist label doesn’t stick for Americans who see him criticised roundly day in and day out in the press. In a world where Joe Rogan has more pull than Jennifer Lopez, Trump’s new media appearances have certainly helped him counter the image curated by mainstream media.The seven swing states are closer than they have ever been and could decide the election. At the time of writing, The New York Times’ average has Trump leading in North Carolina, Nevada, Georgia, and Arizona. Pennsylvania is level, while Harris is just ahead in Wisconsin and Michigan.A disclaimer often needed for Trump is that many people are hesitant to declare support for him publicly due to fear of backlash, which could mean his actual support is higher than it appears. In 2020, Biden managed to win six of the seven swing states, but it was close. For example, in Arizona, Biden won by just 10,457 votes. A total of 44,000 votes in Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin prevented a tie in the Electoral College in 2020, and Trump’s closing of the gap in swing states will be worrying for Democrats.Despite being a legacy bête noire, Trump often outshines his opponents theatrically. He excels at retail politics, often doing things that are extremely relatable. He can also use his opponents' barbs to shift the narrative. After Harris claimed she worked at McDonald’s, Trump ended up working at an outlet, looking like the employee of the month. After Joe Biden called Trump supporters “garbage,” Trump responded by driving a garbage truck and dancing in an orange garbage worker’s vest. Trump, as Rogan recently noted, often comes across as a relatable non-politician, saying things that resonate with voters.As of October 2024, for the first time in three decades, more Americans identify as Republicans instead of Democrats, a remarkable shift given that the Democrats have won the last four popular votes and seven of the last eight. Democrats have become increasingly defensive, relinquishing their earlier positions on immigration, energy, crime, and even social security. Biden’s approval ratings remain low, and Harris has struggled to differentiate her positions from Biden’s. Among various minority groups, including Muslims, Hindus, Latinos, and African Americans , Trump’s popularity has grown, with many feeling Democrats have taken their votes for granted.Sympathy for Trump has increased, despite mainstream media’s portrayal. After being de-platformed post-6 January, some individuals who used to see his rants daily forgot how abrasive he could be. Additionally, the Biden administration’s efforts to prosecute Trump in numerous cases have created a sense of sympathy that extends beyond his traditional supporters. Trump has managed to play the card well of a man who is being unduly attacked by the system. In fact, when a former president is treated like this in any other country, there are usually numerous articles by American media outlets about ""democracy backsliding"".Unlike 2016, when Trump had surrounded himself with traditional Republicans including VP Mike Pence , Trump’s current team is more MAGA. Many potential Trump voters admit they aren’t just voting for Donald Trump, echoed by Bill Ackman. They are also voting for JD Vance, Vivek Ramaswamy , Tulsi Gabbard, Elon Musk, and RFK Jr. Each of them is a different Jungian archetype who brings something different to the table. They are all, in their own way, exceptionally articulate. RFK packs Kennedy loyalty with huge popularity among vaccine deniers and other conspiracy theorists. JD Vance is an exceptional debater who can dance with the liberal media and make them eat their own words.Vivek Ramaswamy is a Tiger Mom’s dream child who can articulate the MAGA vision in layman’s terms. Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democrat, is an exceptional debater as well. And Musk is one of the sharpest people alive, who has changed numerous tech industries. Combined, all of them promise a vision of America that is more hopeful than doom and gloom.In the last few months, Musk has gone all-in on Trump, and his achievements, whether at SpaceX or Tesla, are often seen as emblematic of what could become part of the American landscape if Trump returns to office. The mainstream media’s ""Trump Derangement Syndrome"" seems to extend to Musk as well; it was almost surprising not to see the Biden administration congratulate Musk after one of SpaceX's most remarkable achievements , when its ""chopsticks"" caught a booster rocket.Musk’s acquisition of X (formerly Twitter) has transformed media consumption, with more people preferring X’s unfiltered approach over what they perceive as biased mainstream coverage. Musk’s influence has also helped make it more acceptable for tech figures to support Trump, with some Silicon Valley giants showing their approval openly. In recent weeks, figures like Sundar Pichai , Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg have all reached out to the Trump campaign. And with Vance, they might finally have a ""tech bro"" in the White House.In the American Kulturkampf, MAGA hasn’t just infiltrated and turned the Republican establishment inside out, but also browbeaten the Democratic Party’s liberal orthodoxy. The Democratic orthodoxy tied itself in knots with a host of issues like the trans movement and identity politics, allowing MAGA to reach historically anti-Republican voters. There is even anecdotal evidence where Indian American immigrants prefer Red states to Blue ones to avoid what they call “trans indoctrination” of children. The same goes for immigration, which MAGA has framed as a battle between illegal immigrants and minorities.The shifting sand in American politics is evidenced by H arris bragging about her Glock or refusing to say whether prisoners should have access to taxpayer-funded gender-affirming surgery. This shift in identity politics is huge, considering in 2019, she announced her pronouns during a CNN debate. This has also been evident in how men and women are voting. A WaPo average of October national polls shows Harris leading by an average of 11 points among women, while Trump leads by 10 points among men (a 21-point gap in the margin).In 2020, Harris’s presidential campaign was an unmitigated disaster, which had to be wrapped up before she could get a single vote. Unlike Hillary Clinton , who had to power through two pugilistic primaries, Harris was virtually given the nomination after the Biden coup. Suddenly, a VP candidate with high unfavorability ratings was projected as one who was the best choice to beat the Republicans. This led many Republicans to call her a DEI candidate.David Sacks had argued that Harris would get caught in a “doom loop” : the more interviews she gives, the lower her ratings drop, which prompts more interviews. Unlike Trump, Harris struggles at retail politics, and while Trump struggles at the details, his running mate Vance is exceptionally good at that. On the other hand, Tim Walz has failed to bring the same level of enthusiasm to the ticket and was handed a chastening defeat by Vance in the only vice-presidential debate. Of all major party candidates, Harris had the least time to prepare and has struggled as the campaign goes on.And finally, there’s an unsaid truth about American politics, evidenced in the facts. America is a deeply racist and misogynist society. Abraham Lincoln had to go to war to abolish slavery. It wasn’t until 1920 that women could vote in elections. It took until 1965 to extend voting rights to all Black people. State after state used Jim Crow laws in the post-Civil War era to deny Black people their rights. America has voted for a Black man to become president only once. It has never had a female president. And it might be a bridge too far for too many American voters, including Black ones, to vote for a half-Indian, half-Black woman, irrespective of the candidate she is up against. Even in 2024, that might be a bridge too far for America.",Mainstream media’s “Trump Derangement Syndrome” has prevented it from covering Trump in a cogent way. New media has emerged that asks people to look at Trump on his own merits.

QUETTA: The Baloch Students Council (BSC) Islamabad, representing Baloch students from various universities across Islamabad and Rawalpindi, has issued a statement condemning the ongoing forced disappearances , profiling, and harassment of Baloch students.In a recent statement, the council asserted that state actions against Baloch youth have exceeded ""all limits"" in what they describe as unconstitutional treatment of Baloch students, reported The Balochistan Post .The BSC highlighted recent incidents that they believe reflect a disturbing trend of repression aimed at silencing Baloch students, creating an environment of fear throughout Islamabad's campuses. ""The enforced disappearances of Baloch students are occurring with disturbing frequency,"" a BSC spokesperson stated.During a hearing at the Islamabad High Court on February 28, 2024, addressing the recovery of missing Baloch students, Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar was present.

ISLAMABAD: In a pivotal legislative move, the Pakistani government introduced a bill on Friday that seeks to authorise military and civil armed forces to detain individuals charged with terrorism for up to three months under a system of "" preventive detention .""This bill, which amends the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) of 1997, was tabled by law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar in a session of the National Assembly that saw limited attendance and was quickly referred to the relevant committee for further consideration, Dawn reported.The proposed legislation includes measures for forming Joint Investigation Teams (JITs) made up of various law enforcement and intelligence agency members to conduct inquiries into terrorism-related cases.These amendments to Clause 11EEEE of the ATA were initially enacted following the tragic Army Public School attack in Peshawar but lapsed a decade ago due to a sunset clause.As outlined in the bill's Statement of Objects and Reasons, the ""erstwhile amendments of Section 11EEEE of the Act are required to be re-inserted to empower the government, armed forces and civil armed forces with the necessary authority to detain individuals who pose a significant threat to national security.""The new provisions would allow preventive detention based on credible information or reasonable suspicion, enabling authorities to intervene before potential terrorist acts can be carried out, reported Dawn.Furthermore, the bill aims to strengthen the legal framework for law enforcement agencies to conduct more effective operations against terrorism. It will facilitate the formation of JITs to conduct thorough inquiries and gather actionable intelligence.According to the bill, Section 11EEEE was amended in 2014 to allow the government and authorised military and civil forces to detain individuals suspected of terrorism-related activities, but its validity expired in 2016 due to a sunset clause.The proposed amendment states: ""The government or, where the provisions of Section 4 have been invoked, the armed forces or civil armed forces, as the case may be, subject to the specific or general order of the government in this regard, for a period not exceeding three months and after recording reasons thereof, issue order for the preventive detention of any person who has been concerned in any offence under this Act relating to the security or defence of Pakistan or any part thereof, or public order relating to target killing, kidnapping for ransom, and extortion, bhatta or the maintenance of supplies or services, or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so concerned, for purpose of inquiry.""Additionally, the amendment specifies that the detention of such persons, including any extensions beyond three months, will adhere to Article 10 of the Constitution. A new provision mandates that if an armed forces-issued detention order is made, the inquiry will involve a JIT, including a police officer of at least superintendent rank and members from various intelligence agencies.These new provisions will remain valid for two years following the commencement of the ATA (Amendment) Act, 2024.In related parliamentary discussions, speaker Ayaz Sadiq warned he would summon meetings of seven standing committees to elect chairpersons if the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party does not provide nominations by next week. The issue was raised after criticism of government ministers' absence during a question hour, Dawn reported.Law minister Tarar also addressed concerns regarding the placement of several opposition lawmakers on the Exit Control List (ECL), indicating that names are added due to absconding in criminal cases. He encouraged opposition members to formally submit requests for review, stating that 65 to 70 per cent of ECL removal requests are typically accepted.The National Assembly is scheduled to reconvene on Monday evening.","Pakistani government introduces bill to authorise military and civil armed forces to detain individuals charged with terrorism for up to three months.

ISLAMABAD: At least seven people, including five schoolchildren and a police constable, were killed and more than 20 others injured in a roadside bomb explosion in Mastung district of Pakistan ’s southwestern Balochistan province on Friday.State-run PTV news quoted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as saying that the explosion had occurred at a “girls’ high school”, while another post by the outlet said the incident occurred “near girls’ high school chowk”.Naeem Bazai, commissioner for Kalat division, said the attack had occurred near Mastung’s civil hospital, a few metres from the girls’ school.Officials said the blast resulted from an improvised explosive device (IED) fitted inside a motorcycle parked outside a mechanic’s shop. “The IED exploded when a police mobile and a school van were crossing the blast site,” said Mastung district deputy commissioner Baz Muhammad Marri.“Seven people, including a cop and five minor children, were killed and 22 others injured in the explosion,” Marri told the media. “We are ascertaining who was actually targeted because a police mobile and a school van were both passing by the area,” he added.Sarfaraz Bugti, Balochistan’s chief minister, condemned the attack and expressed grief over the loss of lives. “The terrorists have targeted innocent children. We will hold accountable, the perpetrators of the blast,” he said in a statement.Waseem Baig, a spokesman for the Balochistan health department, said 11 injured, including two children, had been shifted to a trauma centre in Quetta, the provincial capital. “Three injured are in critical condition,” he added.Balochistan, Pakistan’s largest province by area, has been facing grave security conditions since the country launched a military offensive there in 2006, vowing to wipe out so-called traitors and terrorists.At least 20 labourers were killed in a rocket attack in October on coal mines in the province’s Duki district. The incident had prompted more than 40,000 other labourers to return to their native areas in Punjab and Sindh. Several workers were killed in Sept when armed men stormed an under-construction house in Panjgur. All slain labourers hailed from Multan, Punjab province.The volatile situation in Balochistan has also been a major challenge for Beijing to complete projects linked to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Chinese nationals, mostly working on CPEC projects, are often targeted by militants in the province.","At least seven people, including five schoolchildren and a police constable, were killed and more than 20 others injured in a roadside bomb explosion in Mastung district of Pakistan ’s southwestern Balochistan province.

"Beijing breakpoint over 'unacceptable' terror attacks, Pakistan 'perplexed'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/beijing-breakpoint-over-unacceptable-terror-attacks-pakistan-perplexed/articleshow/114860322.cms,"ISLAMABAD: China finds it ""unacceptable"" that its citizens have been targeted by terrorists in Pakistan twice in six months, Chinese ambassador Jiang Zaidong said at an event in Islamabad, striking a rare discordant note in public over seven Chinese casualties in suicide attacks since March.The strain on bilateral relations came out in the open after Pakistan's deputy PM and foreign minister Ishaq Dar appeared to score an own goal by declaring that his country was the only one to which China would send its nationals despite harbouring security concerns.""The Chinese are very clear — no matter how lucrative an investment opportunity arises anywhere, if there is a security issue, they do not send Chinese personnel. Your country is the only exception,"" Dar said, quoting Chinese authorities as telling their Pakistani counterparts at recent meetings.He was speaking at a seminar this week organised by the Pakistan-China Institute, an independent Islamabad-based think tank.Chinese envoy Jiang Zaidong, who was at the event, stood up to contradict Dar. ""The security of Chinese citizens is paramount for President Xi (Jinping),"" he said, adding that Beijing iterated its priorities during Xi's discussions with the Pakistan govt during his recent visit to the country.He warned that violence targeting Chinese nationals was causing a rethink on Beijing's investments under its Belt and Road Initiative(BRI). The diplomat stressed the need for Islamabad to take effective remedial measures to prevent the recurrence of such acts of terror acts.In an official response Thursday, Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch termed the Chinese ambassador's statement ""perplexing"" and a stark departure from longstanding diplomatic norms governing bilateral ties.The Chinese officials seldom chastise Islamabad for alleged security failings involving Chinese engineers and workers, and Pakistan’s public response to China’s criticism is also unprecedented. However, Beijing’s security concerns have been heightened by the recent increase in violence against Chinese people.Earlier this month, two Chinese citizens were killed and 10 others wounded in a suicide attack near Karachi airport for which the outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army later owned responsibility.In March, five Chinese engineers died in a suicide bombing in the Besham region of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Twenty-one Chinese workers have been killed in Pakistan since the countries launched the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project a decade ago.","China finds it ""unacceptable"" that its citizens have been targeted by terrorists in Pakistan twice in six months.

Severe flooding in Pakistan's Sindh province has left thousands of people suffering: Rights group,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/severe-flooding-in-pakistans-sindh-province-has-left-thousands-of-people-suffering-rights-group/articleshow/114851746.cms,"(ANI photo)

SINDH: Amnesty International has condemned the suffering of thousands of Sindhis who are affected due to severe flooding and a surge in water-borne diseases in the backdrop of the Pakistan government's inaction, according to the rights group statement.Following major flooding in August 2024, more than 140,000 people were displaced with many now living in tents. Months later, affected communities are still struggling with health risks and lost livelihoods compounded by little international or government support.With disease rampant due to stagnant floodwaters, older people, children and pregnant women are at increased risk of illness and death.Amnesty said that the Sindh government has failed to guarantee essential services such as healthcare, food, and housing. This has led to the violation of economic, social, and cultural rights as outlined by the international human rights ratified by Pakistan, the statement said.Scott Edwards, Crisis Response Programme Director at Amnesty International, stated, ""Tens of thousands of people have been abandoned by the Sindh government and the international community after being devastated again by major floods. Many impacted communities were harmed by record-breaking floods in 2022 and have struggled to rebuild their lives.""Edwards emphasized the urgency of addressing climate changeand its humanitarian impacts, calling for immediate action from both the international community and Pakistauthorities. ""Climate change is not a tentative threat; lives are being lost today to global inaction and inadequate humanitarian response,"" he said.Shazia Chandio lost her son during the floods, she told Amnesty International, for one day and one night he was suffering diarrhoea, and then the next day he died."" She further expressed her sorrow and said, ""Nobody has helped. Those who have money here move to a safer place, but those who don't have money stay.""In September 2024, Amnesty International visited eight flood-affected villages in the Badin and Dadu districts of Sindh. They interviewed 36 residents including groups such as older adults, people with disabilities, and children. The organisation urged people to support the people who suffered due to flooding.","Amnesty International has condemned the suffering of thousands of Sindhis who are affected due to severe flooding.
