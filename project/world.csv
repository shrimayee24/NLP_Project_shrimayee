Trump Reveals Location For Putin Meeting; 'Hidden Message' For Russian President? | Ukraine War

NEW DELHI: India on Saturday welcomed the agreement between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold a summit in Alaska on August 15, 2025, describing it as a possible breakthrough in ending the war in Ukraine.“India welcomes the understanding reached between the United States and the Russian Federation for a meeting in Alaska on 15th August 2025. This meeting holds the promise of bringing to an end the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and opening up the prospects for peace. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said on several occasions - This is not an era of war,"" the ministry of external affairs said in a statement released on Saturday.""India, therefore, endorses the upcoming Summit meeting and stands ready to support these efforts,"" it further added.The statement comes as Trump imposed 50% tariff on India, accusing it of supporting Moscow's 'war machine' against Ukraine by buying Russian oil.US had earlier announced 25% additional duties on Indian imports in the country, on the top of an already 25% tariff, taking the total to 50%.The order specified that ""The ad valorem duty imposed...shall be in addition to any other duties, fees, taxes, exactions, and charges applicable to such imports...""The implementation timeline shows the base duty taking effect from August 7, whilst the additional charge begins from August 27, following a 21-day period.The order said, ""I find that the Government of India is currently directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil. Accordingly, and as consistent with applicable law, articles of India imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 25%.""US President Donald Trump will be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15, in an effort to negotiate a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, which began with Russia’s invasion in February 2022 and has seen numerous failed rounds of talks.It will be Putin’s first visit to the United States in a decade, his last being in 2015 for the UN General Assembly in New York.For Trump, the meeting marks his most direct attempt yet to fulfil his campaign pledge to end the war “within 24 hours,” a promise that has faced repeated setbacks despite phone calls, peace talks and diplomatic visits.The choice of Alaska is has symbolic importance as Russia sold the territory to the US in 1867, and its western tip sits just across the Bering Strait from Russia’s easternmost point.The Kremlin confirmed the meeting after US envoy Steve Witkoff met Putin in Moscow. During his visit, Witkoff proposed a trilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but Russia did not respond to the idea.“The Russian side left this option completely without comment,” Kremlin spokesperson Ushkov said.Earlier, Trump had told reporters he would likely meet Putin face-to-face “very soon.”His efforts to halt Russia’s military offensive have so far yielded little progress, with three rounds of direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv ending without a breakthrough.","India welcomes the agreement between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold a summit in Alaska on August 15, 2025.

We decided how we want to control the escalation. So, I want to make it very clear, there were no restrictions on us,"" the ACM added.The remarks are significant since the opposition has attacked govt on Operation Sindoor by latching onto some remarks made by India's defence attache to Indonesia, Captain Shiv Kumar, in a seminar there on June 29. He had said the IAF lost some fighters on May 7 because of the ""constraint"" given by the political leadership to target only the nine terror hubs and not attack Pakistan's military establishments and air defences on that day.The IAF chief, however, said ""full freedom was given to us to plan and execute"" the strikes. ""I must say that our attacks have been calibrated because we wanted to be mature about it,"" he said.There was a lot of planning and discussion among the chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan and the three Service chiefs, with national security advisor Ajit Doval also playing ""a very big role"" in getting all the forces and agencies together, ACM Singh said.After the Pahalgam terror massacre on April 22, it was decided the response could not be limited to the usual objectives. The aim this time was to strike not just the foot soldiers of terrorism, but the leadership infrastructure that sustained them, ACM Singh said.While seven targets close across the border were targeted by the Army, the IAF took on the main headquarters of the Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke and Jaish-e-Muhammed in Bahawalpur that were further away.The two headquarters were hardened, well-defended structures, with the long-range strikes aimed at leadership residences, other housing for operatives and the spaces used for congregations and training, with a strict emphasis on minimising civilian casualties.This time there was also emphasis on getting video and other footage of the ""hits"" on different targets. The absence of such evidence during the air strikes on the Jaish-e-Muhammed terror facility at Balakot in Feb 2019 had led some quarters to doubt the claims at that time. ""So, I am very happy that this time we were able to take care of that ghost of Balakot,"" ACM Singh said.",Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh says govt did not impose any operational restrictions on the armed forces during the May 7-10 hostilities against Pakistan.

Wayne Gretzky’s silence on Donald Trump’s anti-Canada rhetoric still sparks debate years later,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/wayne-gretzkys-silence-on-donald-trumps-anti-canada-rhetoric-still-sparks-debate-years-later/articleshow/123211690.cms,"Wayne Gretzky’s reputation took an unexpected hit in the mid-2020s (Getty Images)

From national hero to lightning rod for criticism

Public reaction and lasting perception



Once celebrated as Canada’s most beloved sports icon, Wayne Gretzky’s reputation took an unexpected hit in the mid-2020s — not because of his legendary NHL career, but because of his perceived silence during a politically charged moment between Canada and the United States.Gretzky, known worldwide as “The Great One,” had long been a symbol of Canadian pride, leading the Edmonton Oilers to four Stanley Cups in the 1980s and carrying the maple leaf on the international stage. His emotional departure to the Los Angeles Kings in 1988 was mourned by fans, but it never tarnished his image at home.That changed when Gretzky was spotted at Donald Trump ’s Mar-a-Lago election night party wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat, and later attending Trump’s inauguration. The optics were jarring for many Canadians — especially as Trump ramped up rhetoric suggesting Canada should become the “51st state” and mocking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as merely the “governor” of Canada.Gretzky’s friendship with Trump wasn’t new — his son-in-law, golfer Dustin Johnson, was already close to the former U.S. president — but it was his refusal to publicly push back on Trump’s remarks that lit a firestorm.As Edmonton sportswriter Terry Jones put it, “If I’m right that [Gretzky] doesn’t think Canada should become the 51st state, he should step up and say it.”The fallout was swift. A statue of Gretzky outside Edmonton’s Rogers Place was vandalized with excrement, an almost unthinkable act against a national treasure. Fans noticed when, during a Canada-USA hockey event, he appeared in a navy suit rather than the iconic red jersey worn by past honorary captains — a symbolic absence of visible patriotism.Other Canadian celebrities, like Mike Myers and Michael Bublé, openly defended Canada’s sovereignty during this period. Gretzky, however, remained silent.Also Read: Connor McDavid’s path to Wayne Gretzky’s points record: Can the Oilers captain make NHL history?

Long-term rebuilding and heritage conservation Better preparedness to prevent future damage

DEHRADUN: The Kheer Gad river surged through without warning, tearing through Dharali - a village that holds its history in the soil. The flash flood halved the settlement, destroying homes and orchards, and burying what little remained of its oldest monument: the Kalp Kedar temple, a shrine dedicated to Shiva and, as local lore has it, built by the Pandavas during their exile.Only the temple's dome - long visible above ground since a glacial shift in the early 20th century submerged the rest - had endured.Carved with the face of Kalabhairava, it remained a visible fragment of something larger and unseen. Now, that too is gone, covered by fresh silt, boulders and broken timber. The Shivling has stayed hidden beneath earth and water for generations.In the 1980s, residents had tried to excavate the structure, but the Shivling never emerged - as though resisting visibility. That mirrored the lore: Shiva, unwilling to grant the Pandavas absolution, is said to have scattered himself across the Himalayas, each fragment becoming a site of worship. Kalp Kedar, believed by locals to be a prototype of Kedarnath, was one of those pieces - half-visible, always revered. ""This wasn't just a flood. It took the heart of the village,"" said Manoj Rana, former pradhan, surveying the damage.Set at an altitude of 650 metres (2,100 feet) above sea level, it was once a key halt on the Indo-Tibetan trade route.The Bhotia traders moved wool and salt through these hills, and many settled in nearby Bagori and Harsil, blending Buddhist and Hindu traditions. While Dharali does not lie on the formal Panch Kedar route, villagers consider Kalp Kedar part of that sacred constellation - not geographically, but spiritually. Its submerged form, they believe, was no accident but part of the same divine refusal that defines the myth: a god withdrawing from view, leaving only fragments behind. Brijesh Sati, general secretary of the Char Dham Teerth Purohit Mahapanchayat, said, ""The temple was near the bridge. Kalp Kedar had immense importance for the region. It was restored by Adi Shankracharya and worshipped as one of the oldest shrines to Shiva.""In the village's modern history came the British deserter Frederick Wilson, known locally as Pahadi Wilson, who made Harsil his home in the mid-19th century. He introduced apple saplings and red rajma to the region - both of which reshaped Dharali's economy. Today, the village exports apples across northern India. The trees remain, but the terraces along the river were swept away this week. Several orchards were flattened. Footbridges leading to fields were carried off downstream. Entire homes - including those belonging to long-settled families - were torn in half.Just 6km from Harsil, Dharali also serves as a base for Himalayan treks, including the Gaumukh-Tapovan and Lama Top routes. It lies close to Gartang Gali, a century-old wooden bridge carved into the rock face that was once used by Indo-Tibetan traders. But Dharali has never been a destination in itself. It has existed between paths - passed through, not always visited, known more to pilgrims and orchardists than to tourists.","Dharali was once a key halt on the Indo-Tibetan trade route.

Parents lodged missing complaint on June 29, says SP

BHUBANESWAR: A 17-year-old teenager killed his 12-year-old younger brother and buried the body close to their house one-and-a-half months back without giving the slightest hint until police arrested him at Titilagarh in Balangir on Saturday.The accused told police that he committed the crime because he constantly felt sidelined and neglected because his parents paid more attention to his sibling.For around 45 days it was a blind case for the police. But a vital clue provided by the accused's parents during questioning unravelled the mystery. The accused's mother told police that when she returned home on June 28 evening, her elder son (the accused) was washing the floor.When police asked if he did it regularly, she replied in the negative bringing the older sibling under the purview of the investigation. He confessed to the crime soon after. Sources said the accused tried to clean the blood after he stabbed his younger brother. The accused used an agricultural tool kept in the house to dig the pit twice, once immediately after the murder and again late at night on the same day, police said.IGP (northern range) Himanshu Kumar Lal said the boy first buried the body inside the house and then late in the night shifted it to another place nearby, fearing his parents would suspect if the body remained inside. ""After it was ascertained that the older sibling was involved, it was not tough to establish the crime. So we exhumed the body,"" he said.SP (Balangir) Abilash G said the parents, both daily-wage labourers, lodged a missing complaint at Titlagarh police station on June 29. Initially police suspected it to be a case of child trafficking. ""Though police officers were deployed strategically and all CCTV cameras were scanned, we were getting no result. Interrogation of the parents time and again led to the detection,"" the SP said. The minor accused in the case is being treated under the category of Children In Conflict with Law (CICL).","Parents lodged missing complaint on June 29, says SP Abilash G.

Dogs trained to detect faintest trace of human scent as deep as 15-18 ft

DEHRADUN: In the pale light of a rainy morning, soldiers moved across a slope of decimated earth, slowing as Hazel lowered her head, snout twitching and nostrils flaring as she swept the ground in deliberate arcs.The labrador, in a black Army harness with SAR (search and rescue) inscribed on it, is one in the pack of six Army dogs now searching for survivors in a virtually non-existent Dharali that's buried under mounds of debris since Aug 5.The pack, with silky black and golden fur coats, arrived in staggered movements from bases in Dehradun, Meerut and Lucknow. Along with Hazel are three females, Jansi, 2, Sara, 3, and June, 5, and two males, Opana, 2½, and the most field-experienced Rahi, 7, with five years of service behind her.Sara, Opana and Rahi worked in the 2024 floods in Wayanad and Shimla. The rest are here for their first deployment beyond controlled drills.June, stationed in Harsil since late May, was caught with her handler on Aug 5 between falling rock and a sudden rise in water while moving towards Dharali. They escaped but were trapped by the blocked route.Later that day, Rahi's path from Dehradun was cut by fresh slides. On Aug 6, Opana, Jansi and Sara left Meerut, and Hazel travelled from Lucknow to Dehradun.The next day, with weather clearing briefly, all four were flown into the valley.Work for the pack begins at 6.30am and ends after 12 hours, divided into rotations to keep them sharp: an hour of searching followed by 20 minutes of rest, repeated six or seven times.In heavy terrain, the cycle shortens to 30-35 minutes with 10-minute breaks, sustained for up to three hours before a longer rest and feeding. Handlers move them in wide arcs, reading the stillness, the fixed stare or the pawing at the ground that signals a possible find.Lt Col Manish Srivastava, PRO, defence (Dehradun), told TOI that the dogs had been trained to save buried lives. ""Agile, alert and precise, they are operating in areas where machines cannot go,"" he said.They are trained to detect the faintest trace of human scent - whether from clothing or from air trapped in collapsed structures - through four or five feet of packed mud, and in some conditions as deep as 15-18 feet. ""They are our force multipliers in this operation,"" said an officer involved in the mission.

The United States blocked Afghanistan’s foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s visit to Pakistan, Dawn reported. Muttaqi was scheduled to visit Pakistan on August 4 as part of recent efforts to improve ties between Kabul and Islamabad.The initiative followed Pakistani deputy PM and foreign minister Ishaq Dar’s earlier visit to Kabul, which had been facilitated by China.According to diplomatic sources cited by Dawn, Muttaqi, who is under international sanctions, is barred from foreign travel without a special waiver from the UN sanctions committee.The report stated that the US refused to approve a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) travel ban exemption for Muttaqi by delaying its decision until the last moment. The US decision was believed to have been influenced by concerns over the Taliban government’s growing closeness with China.However, Pakistan’s foreign office did not directly confirm the US role. At the weekly media briefing, foreign office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said there were “certain procedural issues” being worked out and that no official dates had been confirmed for Muttaqi’s visit. “Once these procedural matters are resolved, we look forward to welcoming the Afghan foreign minister to Pakistan,” he was quoted as saying.The US State Department said, “We do not comment on rumours”, when asked at a recent briefing whether the US had blocked Muttaqi’s travel, Dawn reported.",Afghanistan’s foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi was scheduled to visit Pakistan on August 4 as part of recent efforts to improve ties between Kabul and Islamabad.

Pakistan is gearing up to secure its capital, Islamabad, ahead of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. The event, taking place on Tuesday and Wednesday, will see the attendance of key regional leaders, including India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and China's Premier Li Qiang.In preparation for the summit, Pakistan's government has implemented strict measures. These include strict enforcement against movements protesting ethnic nationalism and new laws that limit demonstrations in the capital. Authorities have also detained hundreds of supporters of opposition leader Imran Khan , who is currently jailed, following their attempt to march in Islamabad.Security concerns have been heightened by a recent attack on a convoy of Chinese engineers in Karachi, raising fears for the safety of foreign nationals amid ongoing separatist violence. The government has responded by authorizing troop deployments in the capital throughout the summit's duration.Imtiaz Gul, a security analyst, emphasized the importance of the summit for Pakistan, stating, ""The government claims to have made elaborate security arrangements and understandably so because it has to make sure that the event passes off peacefully without any untoward incident.""The SCO, which includes China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, and six other member states, is viewed by some as an alternative to Western alliances such as NATO. The agenda for the Islamabad summit focuses on trade, humanitarian, and cultural issues, though domestic issues in Pakistan may loom large.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by Imran Khan, has threatened protests during the summit. Ahsan Iqbal Chaudhary, Pakistan's minister for planning, accused the PTI of trying to disrupt the event, stating, ""The PTI doesn't want to showcase the positive side of Pakistan to the world. Instead, they aim to present a picture of the country filled with tear gas and unrest.""To facilitate the summit, Islamabad and the neighboring city of Rawalpindi will observe a public holiday starting Monday, accompanied by road closures to reduce movement. The government quarter hosting the summit has been fortified and prepared for the visiting dignitaries.Pakistan, heavily reliant on Chinese investment for infrastructure projects, is keen to ensure the safety of its citizens and foreign guests, especially considering the broader uptick in militancy linked to the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan.The authorities aim for a peaceful summit to enhance the country's image amidst various internal and external challenges.","Pakistan is hosting a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.

The officer mentioned that wild parties had been ongoing for 15 years, noting that while not all attendees were directly involved in trafficking, many witnessed inappropriate conduct. He stressed that a lot of people were aware of what transpired, particularly as the events became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Vance said that Usha was raised in a Hindu household, has not converted to Catholicism despite attending Mass regularly.In an interview with the, Vance, admitted to feeling uncomfortable about how his religious journey has affected his wife. “I feel — felt — kind of bad,” he explained. “Like, ‘Oh, you didn’t sign up to marry a weekly churchgoer, and are you OK with this?’ And she was sort of more than OK with it, and that was a big part of the confirmation that this was the right thing for me.”Vance revealed that Usha encouraged him to explore Catholicism even though she did not follow the faith herself. “She thought that they were good for me, in a sort of good-for-your-soul kind of way,” he said. “I don’t think I would have ever done it without her support, because I felt kind of bad about it, right?”Reflecting on his spiritual growth, Vance shared his deeper motivations. “When I started to think about the big things, like, what do I actually care about in my life? I really want to be a good husband. I really want to be a good father. I really want to be a good member of the community. I wanted to be a virtuous human being, in other words.”Despite Usha's support, Vance acknowledged the pressures she faces. “I feel terrible for my wife because we go to church almost every Sunday, unless we’re on the road,” he said. He explained that although he helps with their children, Usha tends to feel the burden of keeping them quiet during the service. “Obviously, I help with the kids, but because I’m kind of the one going to church, she feels more responsibility to keep the kids quiet in the church.”Usha and JD Vance met at Yale Law School and married in Kentucky in 2014, with a Hindu priest presiding over a separate ceremony. They have three children. Usha has been pivotal in JD’s political career, helping him shape his thoughts on rural America’s social decline, which inspired his best-selling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy.

'Not giving you any if ... ': Trump at Coachella threatens to withhold wildfire aid from California,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/not-giving-you-any-if-trump-at-coachella-threatens-to-withhold-wildfire-aid-from-california/articleshow/114183838.cms,"Donald Trump has warned California Governor Gavin Newsom that the state could lose vital federal funding for wildfire relief unless action is taken to address ongoing water shortages and a controversial environmental policy. Speaking at a rally in Coachella, the former president criticised the state’s water management, claiming that policies intended to protect the endangered delta smelt fish were hurting farmers and leading to widespread drought conditions.Trump described California’s water crisis in stark terms, suggesting that vast swathes of land had become ""barren"" due to the rerouting of water into the Pacific Ocean to protect the fish. ""Millions and millions of gallons of water... gets pumped right into the Pacific Ocean,"" Trump said, lamenting the waste of water while farmers suffered from drought. He argued that, if elected, he would demand that Newsom reverse these policies, or risk losing federal assistance for the state’s frequent wildfires.Trump’s comments were delivered during a high-profile campaign stop in Coachella, a city in southern California, which he used as a platform to further criticise California’s Democratic leadership. He also made a thinly veiled threat to Newsom, saying, ""We’re not going to give you any of that fire money that we send you all the time for all the forest fires that you have"" unless changes were made.The former president's remarks targeted what he described as a ""mismanagement"" of California’s resources, blaming both state and federal policies for exacerbating the water shortage. Trump suggested that instead of prioritising the fish, the water should be used to support the state’s agricultural industry, which he described as the ""finest land in the country."" He claimed that millions of acres of farmland had been ruined due to the water rerouting and called for an overhaul of water policy.With key battlegrounds like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania at stake, Donald Trump spent Saturday night aiming to link Vice President Kamala Harris to her home state's challenges.

Referring to California as ""Paradise Lost,"" he warned, ""We won’t let Kamala Harris do to America what she did to California.""Despite the rhetoric, Trump’s visit to California is also a fundraising opportunity. Attendees paid up to $25,000 for a photo opportunity with the former president.In 2020, the former president lost California by a wide margin, but still received over 6 million votes—more than any previous GOP candidate. His support was strongest in rural counties, where he won by margins exceeding 70%, areas that traditionally lean conservative.","Donald Trump warned California Governor Gavin Newsom that the state could lose federal funding for wildfire relief unless action is taken to address water shortages and a controversial environmental policy.

Conservative commentator Benny Johnson led the charge, calling Obama’s comments “pure racist identity politics.” Johnson accused Obama of abandoning his previous message of unity, stating, “The magic is gone. This is the same guy who said, ‘There is not a white or Black America—there is only the United States of America!’ Now he’s running on racial supremacy? It’s grotesque.”Johnson's remarks were echoed by other conservative figures, including activist CJ Pearson, who took to social media to reaffirm his support for Trump. Pearson tweeted, “In 25 days, I’ll be joining millions of other young Black men and voting for Donald J. Trump! We don’t care what Barack Obama has to say about it.”Democratic Ohio state senator and former Bernie Sanders campaign advisor Nina Turner also criticized Obama, expressing her disappointment in his decision to single out Black men. Speaking on CNN, Turner said, “Why are Black men being lectured to? Why are Black men being belittled?” While she acknowledged her “love” for Obama, she emphasized that many Black men have valid reasons for voting differently, and those choices should be respected, even if others disagree. Turner urged Democrats not to lay the blame for lower support for Harris solely on Black men, stressing the importance of appealing to all voters and addressing their concerns.Obama's comments have sparked widespread debate, with many Black voters doubling down on their support for Trump. The controversy has also fueled further attacks from Trump himself, who mocked Obama and Harris on Truth Social. Trump claimed that Obama ""lacked enthusiasm"" for Harris and suggested the former president might even vote for him, stating, “Obama can’t stand Low IQ Kamala Harris, so he’ll be voting for President Trump in 2024!”As the 2024 election approaches, this backlash reflects broader concerns within the Democratic Party about energizing voters, particularly among Black men, a crucial demographic that could influence the election outcome.","Obama's comments have sparked widespread debate, with many Black voters doubling down on their support for Trump.

Former US President Donald Trump is leading over Vice President Kamala Harris when it comes to the question that who would better steer the country through the Ukraine and Middle East wars, according to a Wall Street Journal opinion poll of seven battleground states.According to a poll published on Friday, Harris and Trump witnessed neck-to-neck battle in the seven states that could decide the November presidential polls.Harris holds a narrow 2-point lead in Arizona, Georgia, and Michigan.

Americans are considering key issues, such as the economy, immigration, women's rights, and democratic values, as they decide whom to support.The tight results of the poll reflect similar findings in other surveys, indicating that the election could go either way.

The poll shows Harris slightly ahead with 46% support, compared to Trump's 43%.Kamala Harris could secure a narrow majority in the Electoral College if she wins in states where she currently holds an advantage, according to a recent Wall Street Journal (WSJ) poll.The poll indicates that Donald Trump leads Harris in key areas. In seven swing states, 50% of respondents believe Trump is better equipped to manage Russia's war in Ukraine, compared to 39% for Harris. Similarly, Trump holds a lead over Harris, 48% to 33%, on handling the Israel-Hamas conflict.On economic issues and immigration, more voters support Trump. Conversely, Harris is favored over Trump on matters related to housing, healthcare, and empathy.

A US army soldier has been sentenced to 14 years in prison for attempting to aid ISIS in planning attacks on American troops, the Department of Justice revealed. Cole Bridges, from Stow, Ohio, was found guilty of trying to support the terrorist group and conspiring to murder US soldiers, as reported by ABC News.24-year-old Bridges, who joined the Army in 2019, was a cavalry scout in the Third Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, Georgia. Before enlisting, he had started exploring jihadist propaganda online, expressing his support for ISIS on social media. By October 2020, he was communicating with an FBI undercover agent posing as an ISIS supporter in contact with fighters in the Middle East.“Bridges provided training and guidance to purported ISIS fighters who were planning attacks, including advice about potential targets in New York City,” the DOJ said. He also sent the FBI agent portions of a US Army training manual, believing it would assist ISIS in their operations.In December 2020, Bridges increased his involvement by supplying instructions on how to ambush US forces in the Middle East. He shared diagrams and tactics intended to help ISIS maximise the effectiveness of their attacks. Bridges even advised on how to rig buildings with explosives to target US Special Forces.In January 2021, Bridges recorded a video of himself in his US Army uniform, standing before an ISIS flag and making a gesture of support for the terrorist group. A week later, he sent another video in which he delivered a speech, using voice manipulation to conceal his identity.The FBI, along with several other military and intelligence agencies, was involved in the investigation.

American musician Landon Barker has come under fire for attending a party that mocked the serious sexual assault allegations against Sean “Diddy” Combs. The backlash follows Barker’s 21st birthday celebration at Nobu Malibu, after which he headed to a friend's birthday bash at a Los Angeles club.Clips from the event surfaced online, showing servers delivering bottles of baby oil adorned with flashing lights—a reference to the thousands of bottles seized from Diddy ’s homes earlier this year. While some partygoers laughed at the reference, the “bottle girls” serving the drinks appeared uncomfortable with the situation. One attendee captioned a video, “Baby oil show for the bday boy loolololol.”Although guests began passing the bottles around, Barker was not seen participating and seemed somewhat uneasy about the entire affair. In another clip, a DJ announced, “We’re getting really freaky tonight.

In one upcoming lawsuit, a woman alleges that Combs doused her with drug-infused oil before raping her alongside his bodyguard. Ariel Mitchell-Kidd, an attorney for several accusers, shared “graphic” details of her client’s alleged assault, claiming Diddy threatened her with a knife and used an oil-like substance believed to contain a date rape drug.54-year-old rapper Diddy was arrested last month on multiple charges, including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. He has pleaded not guilty to these charges, and his bail requests have been denied several times. He is expected to remain in custody in Brooklyn , NY, until his trial, which is scheduled to begin on May 5, 2025.","Landon Barker attended a party that mocked the serious sexual assault allegations against Sean ""Diddy"" Combs.

ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan government on Saturday warned to use force if jailed former prime minister Imran Khan 's party went ahead to hold a protest in Islamabad on the occasion of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) politic committee, comprising of its key members, decided to hold a protest at D-Chowk in the capital on Tuesday if the government failed to meet its demand to give the 72-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician access to his legal team and a physician, spokesman Zulfiqar Bukhari said.The authorities due to security concerns stopped all meetings with Khan, who has been incarcerated in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail , after the protest by the party over the last weekend.Defence Minister Khawaja Asif warned that the government would use ""full force"" to stop the PTI's planned protest on the occasion of the SCO summit .""The call for protest on October 15 is an attack on the integrity of the country. We will not allow [anyone] to damage the honour and reputation of the country. The state will use all of its power and resources to prevent the invasion of Islamabad,"" said Asif while speaking to the media in Sialkot.The politician also called for the courts to intervene and take notice of the matter. ""Do the courts not see what the PTI founder is doing with the integrity of the country? The actions of the judiciary today will determine their role in history,"" he said.Separately, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal condemned the protest call by terming it "" political terrorism "" which is aimed at maligning the country. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, he expressed disappointment at the timing of the protest.""Now there is no doubt that terrorism in Karachi and political terrorism protest calls are similar,"" the minister said, adding that both aimed to destabilise the country.Iqbal said the PTI was destroying the economy of the country and urged the party supporters to see the harm caused by their actions.""The PTI is attempting to undermine the government's economic recovery efforts. It's crucial to acknowledge the damage caused by these actions and consider the consequences of supporting policies that hinder Pakistan's growth and development,"" he said.The minister also stated that the country cannot afford destructive politics. ""Just because the PTI's leader is jailed, doesn't justify chaos,"" he said.Separately, federal minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit Baltistan Amir Muqam also strongly rejected the PTI's protest call. ""It is proof of anti-nationalism. There is no doubt that PTI's agenda seems to be anti-Pakistan because the party has declared the protest on this important occasion,"" he said.However, the PTI was in no mood to back off and Bukhari said the party was not against any foreign visit but ""this illegitimate government"" was trying to create a false case of normality when ""a former prime minister and leader of the largest party is illegally in prison (according to the UN) along with his wife"".""And to top it off, he has been banned to meet his legal team, doctor or family, which is against all human rights conventions and our constitution.

Pakistan: 20 miners killed by gunmen in Balochistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/20-miners-killed-by-gunmen-in-balochistan/articleshow/114157777.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Gunmen killed 20 miners and injured several others at a private coal mine in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province on Friday, police said.The attack occurred amid heightened security concerns in Pakistan as it prepares to host the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit on Oct 15-16. The major event is expected to see high-level Chinese representation and will also be attended by Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar. Incessant violent incidents in Pakistan’s northwest and southwest have raised serious questions about the ability of its forces to protect high-profile events and foreigners in the country.The assailants, according to police, broke into the miners’ quarters in Balochistan’s Dukki district, gathered the workers together and opened indiscriminate fire. “A group of armed men attacked the Junaid coal company mines in Dukki area in the early hours using heavy weapons,” said Humayun Khan Nasir, in charge of Dukki police station. The victims belonged to various regions of Pakistan, as well as Afghanistan. “Most of the victims were from Pashtun-speaking regions within Balochistan. Three of the deceased and four of the injured are Afghan nationals,” Nasir added.Khairullah Nasir, the coal mine owner, said the attackers used hand grenades, rocket launchers, and other modern weapons in the attack. He added the attackers also set fire to “10 coal engines and machinery”.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but suspicion is likely to fall on the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which often targets civilians and security forces, accusing them of robbing Balochistan of its resources, including minerals and gas.The BLA had carried out multiple attacks in Aug that resulted in more than 50 killings, including that of 23 passengers, mostly from Punjab province, who were shot dead after being taken out of their vehicles. On Monday the group had claimed responsibility for a suicide bomber attack on a convoy of Chinese engineers near Karachi airport. Two Chinese citizens were killed in that attack.There are hundreds of Chinese working in the country, most of them involved in projects linked to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), part of Beijing’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Despite China’s repeated requests for Pakistan to bolster security, there has been a surge in attacks and unrest surrounding key CPEC projects.",Gunmen killed 20 miners and injured several others at a private coal mine in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province. The attack occurred amid heightened security concerns in Pakistan as it prepares to host the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit on Oct 15-16.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114157755,imgsize-1210563,width-400,resizemode-4/114157755.jpg"
