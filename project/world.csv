Troops now have 365 days to eliminate 'last of the Maoists',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/troops-now-have-365-days-to-eliminate-last-of-the-maoists/articleshow/118654879.cms,"IGP Sundarraj said the door is open for Maoists to shun violence and surrender, or have a final face-off with security forces

RAIPUR: The 365-day countdown for the Centre's deadline for elimination of Maoists has begun.Bastar IG P Sundarraj told TOI on Saturday that 310 Maoists had been killed since Jan 2024 and that there are barely ""400 regular armed cadres"" left in Bastar division. A total of 385 Maoists have been slain since 2021, which means the bulk of them were killed in the last year.Even the Maoist central committee is greatly weakened and has only 12-14 active commanders left, he added. These numbers give security agencies confidence that they will be able to meet Union home minister Amit Shah's vow to eradicate naxalism by March 2026. Bastar division now has only around 1,200 Maoists left, the IG said, adding, ""The door is open for them to shun violence and surrender, or have a final face-off with security forces.""""With 385 naxalites killed since 2021, Bastar is left with around 400 regular armed cadres. The remaining 700-800 are militia men who serve as a support system, members of the cultural wing, like Chetna Natya Manch and Dandakaranya Adivasi Kisan Majdoor Sangh (DAKMS). The central committee is also shrinking. Our major concern, as well as target, are the uniformed ones, mostly in PLGA formations , and senior-level cadres of Battalion 1,"" P Sundarraj told TOI.Battalion 1 is headed by dreaded Maoist commander Madvi Hidma, whose home turf is now bristling with security forces, and where basic needs, like roads, water and electricity, are pouring in, thanks to the establishment of police camps.Many central committee members have died due to age-related ailments or have been arrested in the past four years, and those left will also be eliminated automatically with the end of naxals, said police. Sundarraj said that militia members often turn out to be just as dangerous as hard-core PLGA cadres, but the focus is to bring them to the mainstream as they understand the phrase ""Jiska Dum Uske Hum (We stand with the powerful)"". ""They realise they are being used as a tool. Once they are on this side of the fence, they only want development and facilities,"" the IG added.Former Maoist Badranna, who now lives in Jagdalpur, said he believes real solution to naxalism is peace talks.Security experts, however, told TOI that these numbers are just a perception and it's not possible to have an exact naxal cadre count. ""For sure, Maoists have suffered massive losses of late and have been pushed to the brink. Their aggression is almost depleted, yet it's a long fight ahead,"" an internal security veteran cautioned.""If naxalism comes to an end next year, no one can guarantee that no violence will happen after March 31, 2026, but the focus is not based on a single-point agenda. The area of their dominance has decreased, their strength is not the same, security camps are bringing about development that people want, so we are hopeful of reaching the desired goal,"" said IG Sundarraj.","Bastar IG P Sundarraj told TOI that 310 Maoists had been killed since Jan 2024.

From two moms to none: Why 4-month-old HIV+ Mumbai baby is nobody's child,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-two-moms-to-none-why-4-month-old-hiv-mumbai-baby-is-nobodys-child/articleshow/118654518.cms,"Representative image

NAVI MUMBAI: A four-month-old baby girl has become nobody's child after a Hindu woman delivered her at KEM Hospital by fraudulently using the Aadhaar card of a Muslim woman who wanted to adopt the baby without going through the long, legal adoption procedure.The Muslim woman wanted to have another child for herself following a miscarriage during her second pregnancy, and the Hindu woman, who was pregnant, did not want the child as she said her husband was a drug addict. So they struck a deal.On getting a firm assurance from the Muslim woman that she would adopt the child, the Hindu woman delivered the baby using the Muslim woman's Aadhaar card. However, the baby is now ill and was in January detected as HIV positive at Wadia Hospital, so the Muslim woman doesn't want her anymore.While the baby has currently been admitted to a hospital in Kalwa, the state's women and child welfare department has lodged a zero FIR against both women for giving up or accepting and selling or buying a child illegally under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, and for cheating with common intention under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.Police said the mother of the baby girl and the Muslim woman live in the same neighbourhood in Kalyan. It was six months into her pregnancy that the woman told the Muslim woman that she did not want to have the child, which was when the Muslim woman offered to adopt the child. Using the Muslim woman's identity card, the Hindu woman delivered the baby in October 2024 at KEM Hospital. A birth certificate was issued bearing the name of a Muslim girl and mentioning the Muslim woman as her mother.Five days after discharge from hospital, the Muslim woman took the child home. The baby underwent an appendicitis surgery at Wadia Hospital in Jan this year, where she was detected as being HIV positive. Following this, the Muslim woman was taken for HIV tests. Having learnt of the baby's HIV infection, though, the Muslim woman disowned the baby and revealed the details of how she had got her to the hospital staffers, who alerted the local Sakhi centre of the women and child welfare department in Mumbai.Thereafter, on February 21, an email was sent by the local Sakhi centre giving details about the case to the Thane district child protection helpline.The child protection committee staffers could not trace the Muslim woman but succeeded in obtaining the cell number of the woman who gave birth to her. Accordingly, a zero FIR was filed with Manpada police station in Thane on Feb 28. The case has been transferred to Bhoiwada PS in Mumbai for further investigation.An officer of Thane district child protection committee said, ""People should follow adoption rules, and adoption complexities also need to be relaxed through the intervention of the women and child welfare department. This case raises questions about the identity checks of pregnant women who get admitted to govt-run premier hospitals for delivery.""Activists have long been demanding inquiries into such illegal adoptions which may be happening in hospitals, maternity homes, and clinics.","A four-month-old baby girl has become nobody's child after a Hindu woman delivered her at KEM Hospital by fraudulently using the identity card of a Muslim woman.

Manipur has not witnessed any major incidents of ethnic violence for almost four months now. The high-level review is said to have taken stock of the response to Governor Bhalla governor’s appeal for surrender of weapons looted in the wake of outbreak of ethnic violence in May 2023.During the meeting, Shah said that the Modi govt remains fully committed to restoring lasting peace in Manipur and is providing all necessary assistance in this regard.","Home minister Amit Shah issued specific directions to the authorities to ensure the free movement of people on the all roads in the state, starting March 8.

Uttarakhand avalanche: Mana villagers saved by ancient wisdom & annual migration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uttarakhand-avalanche-mana-villagers-saved-by-ancient-wisdom-annual-migration/articleshow/118637614.cms,"Each Nov, as doors of Badrinath temple close, residents of Mana move to Gopeshwar, Jyotirmath, and Jhinkwan in Chamoli district, leaving behind their homes and livelihoods to escape harsh winter

DEHRADUN: Mana, a 2,000-strong village in the upper reaches of Garhwal Himalayas , had already emptied out when disaster struck. By the time an avalanche crashed down the Mana-Ghastoli route on Friday morning, smothering everything in its path, the roads were deserted, the homes abandoned. As a result, not many heard the sound of ice fracturing, snow cascading, and the earth shuddering under its weight. They are now counting their blessings.The villagers' migration, a ritual dictated by centuries of wisdom, is more than tradition - it is survival. The Himalayas demand deference, and the people of Mana have long known when to step aside. ""We are fortunate we had shifted to lower locations; otherwise, many people could have been trapped,"" said Pitambhar Molpha , the village headman.Each Nov, as the doors of the Badrinath temple close, the residents of Mana undertake their annual migration, leaving behind their homes and livelihoods to escape the harsh winter. They move to Gopeshwar, Jyotirmath, and Jhinkwan in Chamoli district. They return only when the Badrinath yatra is about to begin.The avalanche - just 500 metres from the village - was neither the first nor the last. ""Avalanches have been reported here in Feb and March before,"" Molpha said. ""At this time of year, workers are engaged in removing snow from the main routes. There is also an army camp near our village.""For those who leave, there is always the lingering question of what remains. Sandeep Aswal, who runs a tea stall - once known as the 'last tea stall of the country' and now rebranded as the 'first tea stall' - has watched tourists come and go, drawn by Mana's mystique. ""It is an unfortunate incident. Since the village is empty, we don't have any updates on whether the avalanche impacted the area. But we feel blessed that all 400 families had already moved,"" he said.","Mana, a 2,000-strong village in the upper reaches of Garhwal Himalayas, had already emptied out when disaster struck.

India backs EU’s quest for just peace in Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-backs-eus-quest-for-just-peace-in-ukraine/articleshow/118637170.cms,"PM Narendra Modi with EU leader Ursula von der Leyen

PM Narendra Modi joined EU leader Ursula von der Leyen in expressing support – in a leaders’ statement after their meeting Friday – for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine that’s based on respect for international law, principles of the UN Charter and territorial integrity and sovereignty.The leaders also reiterated their commitment to the “vision of the two-State solution” with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security within recognized borders, consistent with international law. This is the first time India has reiterated its support for the two-state solution at the highest level since President Donald Trump announced his plan to overtake Gaza.The solidarity with the EU on Ukraine is particularly significant in the context of what happened in the UN this week when EU States led by France managed to water down the US “forward looking resolution” on Ukraine in the General Assembly that called for lasting, but not just and comprehensive, peace and a swift end to the conflict. The language used in the India-EU leaders’ statement is similar to one of the 3 amendments that France introduced in that resolution - just, lasting and comprehensive peace in Ukraine that respects the United Nations Charter and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.The amendments meant that the US had to abstain from voting on its own resolution in the General Assembly, although it was later adopted in the Security Council in its original form, with 10 votes in favour. The UK, France and the remaining members – Greece, Slovenia and Denmark – abstained.Interestingly, neither leader explicitly mentioned the Ukraine issue in their media statements that followed their bilateral meeting. While describing India as a pillar of certainty in an increasingly uncertain world, von der Leyen only said that authoritarian states are getting bolder, ignoring borders and threatening peace at sea.However, at a public event earlier in the day, she lashed out at Russia for trying to tear Ukraine apart and said what the EU seeks is for any peace talk to lead to “just and lasting” peace. Playing on India’s concerns about China’s expansionism, the EU leader said a failed Ukraine would not just weaken Europe but also ""intensify"" challenges in other parts of the world. “Not least in this region. Other countries around the world are watching very closely whether there is any impunity if you invade a neighbour or violate international borders. Or whether there are real deterrents,’’ said von der Leyen, adding peace, security and prosperity are indivisible in this world.The landmark EU visit, which saw von der Leyen accompanied by the College of Commissioners for the first time, had been in the works for almost 6 months but happened finally at a time its transatlantic alliance is threatening to unravel because of Trump’s policies. The president said wars, conflicts and coups have erupted in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, in Africa and across different regions, adding what happens in one part of the world matters to both Europe and India.“With a free and prosperous Ukraine, that can join the European family. And Europe is ready to live up to its responsibility when it comes to security and defence. We will step up our defence spending to ensure that Member States have access to the full spectrum of capabilities that this new reality demands,’’ she added, talking about historic steps to protect Ukraine and its future.",PM Narendra Modi joined EU leader Ursula von der Leyen in expressing support for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.

Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump openly clashed in the White House on Friday at a meeting where they were due to sign a deal on sharing Ukraine's mineral riches and discuss a peace deal with Russia . US President gave an ultimatum saying, ""make a deal or we are out.""""Your people are very brave, but you're either going to make a deal or we're out, and if we're out, you'll fight it out,"" Trump said in the White House in a dramatic verbal clash.""I don't think it's going to be pretty, but you'll fight it out, but you don't have the cards.""""You're not acting at all thankful. It's not a nice thing,"" the US president said. ""It's going to be very hard to do business like this,"" he added.The encounter began when Vice President JD Vance addressed Zelenskyy, stating ""Mr. President, with respect. I think it's disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.""When Zelenskyy attempted to respond, Trump intervened forcefully, declaring ""You're gambling with the lives of millions of people.""He continued, ""You're gambling with World War III, and what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that's backed you far more than a lot of people say they should have.""The Oval Office, traditionally a venue for diplomatic discussions, witnessed an unprecedented display of hostility.

""We're not looking forward to sending a lot of arms,"" he stated. ""We're looking forward to getting the war finished so we can do other things.""The tension escalated when Vance demanded Zelenskyy to ""just say thank you,"" criticising him for airing disagreements publicly. Trump appeared unbothered by the confrontation, stating ""I think it's good for the American people to see what's going on.""He further remarked, ""This is going to be great television.""Soon after the blowup, Zelenskyy was seen leaving the White House without signing the mineral deal.This challenging encounter occurred at a crucial time for Ukraine, as Zelenskyy sought to secure American support against potential future Russian aggression.Despite the confrontation, Zelenskyy is anticipated to finalise a significant economic agreement with the US, focusing on Ukraine's post-war reconstruction, establishing long-term bilateral ties.The agreement, viewed as progress towards ending the three-year conflict, acknowledges Ukraine's security concerns.Before the heated exchange, Trump mentioned the imminent signing ceremony in the White House's East Room, describing it as ""a very fair deal"" and ""a big commitment from the United States.""Trump expressed desire to halt the conflict's casualties, suggesting American funds should be redirected towards reconstruction efforts.Earlier, Zelenskyy had characterised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a terrorist, asserting to Trump that Ukraine and the global community need ""no compromises with a killer.""","Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump openly clashed in the White House on Friday at a meeting where they were due to sign a deal on sharing Ukraine's mineral riches.

Recently, his wife, Janet Gretzky, revealed a letter written by Canadian hockey legend Bobby Orr to her husband. Orr offered a straightforward evaluation. He felt a sense of disappointment regarding the reaction of the Canadian fans towards Gretzky during the championship game.However, this didn't stop fans trolling Gretzky, with one individual labeling him, “F Wayne Gretzky… Traitor.” In a comparable sentiment, this supporter expressed, “He is nothing but a traitor to Canada now.” Nonetheless, this individual held a firm perspective on Janet’s message, asserting, “Not sure there’s a more boomer response than having your wife post a photo of a physical letter you received to social media.”Canadian sports icon Wayne Gretzky has faced backlash for his association with US political figures, particularly President Trump.

It is accompanied by the sound of ticking and an image of an egg timer with the words: ""Time is running out.""Hamas has proposed releasing all remaining hostages in a single phase under a second-stage ceasefire.

James Carville: What Just Happened In The Oval Office

Democratic strategist James Carville launched a scathing attack on President Donald Trump, suggesting he should be tested for syphilis following his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House.In a video for Politicon, Carville described the meeting as “stunning” and questioned Trump’s mental state, linking his behavior to what he called “madness.” He further speculated that Trump’s alleged health issues, including red splotches on his hands, could be symptoms of syphilis.“It’s impossible for me to ignore the events in the Oval Office earlier today. It’s stunning,” Carville said. “There’s an expression here in south Louisiana... ‘that boy ain’t right.’ When you look at Trump, the first thing that comes to your mind, that boy ain’t right.”Carville’s tirade extended beyond the meeting with Zelenskyy, taking aim at Trump’s physical appearance, marriage, and overall health. He called Trump a “fat f***ing slob” with a “beached whale body,” claiming his weight could be contributing to sleep and circulation problems.“I pointed out on this very channel where Trump had red splotches on his hand, which I was told by any number of medical professionals that when you see that condition, the first thing that you suspect is syphilis,” Carville said. “We know from any number of videos that his wife doesn’t want to get in the same zip code as him. If you had a spouse that had syphilis — you know, I’m not saying he does. I want to be clear. I’m just asking questions.”Carville likened Trump’s behavior to that of King George III, who was believed to suffer from mental instability. “What you saw is madness. And I don’t mean madness like I’m mad at you. I’m talking about madness like King George III kind of madness,” he said.While Carville did not provide medical evidence to support his claims, he insisted the idea of a syphilis diagnosis should be “revisited.” The Mayo Clinic describes syphilis as a bacterial infection that can lead to severe complications if untreated, affecting the heart, brain, and other organs.Neither Trump nor his representatives have responded to Carville’s remarks.","Democratic strategist James Carville suggested President Donald Trump should be tested for syphilis.

US Army's lieutenant general Telita Crosland , the head of the military’s health agency, retired on Friday, making her the latest senior officer to leave under President Donald Trump’s administration.The retirement comes a week after Trump dismissed six senior military officials, including the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the US Navy’s first female leader.Stephen Ferrara, the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, confirmed Crosland’s retirement. ""I want to thank Crosland for her dedication to the nation, to the military health system, and to Army medicine for the past 32 years,"" he said in a statement.However, Crosland was told she had to retire. The officials said no reason was given for the decision, two former officials were quoted as saying by the news agency Reuters.Crosland, who was the first Black woman to lead the Defense Health Agency (DHA), graduated from West Point and joined the US Army as a Medical Corps officer in 1993. She previously served as the Army’s deputy surgeon general, according to her Defense fepartment biography.The Pentagon, under defense secretary Pete Hegseth, has been moving to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Hegseth has argued that these initiatives harm unit cohesion.""The single dumbest phrase in military history is ‘our diversity is our strength,'"" Hegseth said earlier this month during a Pentagon town hall. ""From our perspective, why do you get rid of something like DEI? Because from our perspective, it’s served a purpose of dividing the force, as opposed to uniting the force.""Trump’s defense officials have also ordered an end to identity month celebrations such as Black History Month and Women’s History Month.

Anti-DOGE Protests erupted outside Tesla stores across the United States on Saturday, with demonstrators opposing CEO Elon Musk’s efforts to cut government spending under President Donald Trump’s administration. The protests, part of a broader backlash against Musk’s influence in Washington, also targeted Tesla’s reputation, urging boycotts of the electric vehicle company.According to news reports, more than 50 demonstrations took place across US cities, including Tucson, St. Louis, New York City, Dayton, Charlotte, and Palo Alto, with additional protests planned in England, Spain, and Portugal later in March. A website named 'Tesla Takedown' listed multiple events across North America and Europe.Nathan Phillips, a 58-year-old ecologist protesting in Boston, said, “We can get back at Elon. We can impose direct economic damage on Tesla by showing up at showrooms everywhere and boycotting Tesla and telling everyone else to get out, sell your stocks, sell your Teslas.”Critics argue that Musk’s moves, including directing government job cuts and shutting down sections of federal agencies such as the US Agency for International Development, overstep Congress’s budgetary authority and could create conflicts of interest due to his business ties. Musk also leads SpaceX, which handles Nasa and intelligence community contracts, as well as the social media platform X.Demonstrations in some locations turned tense. In New York City, around 300 people gathered at a Tesla dealership, with police taking nine individuals into custody. Federal prosecutors also charged a woman with vandalising a Tesla dealership in Colorado, where Molotov cocktails were thrown at vehicles and the words “Nazi cars” were spray-painted on the building.Some Tesla owners have reported acts of vandalism against their vehicles, with Jewish groups expressing concern over rising antisemitic incidents. News reports mention spray-painted swastikas on Tesla cars amid the growing controversy.Despite the protests, Musk remains one of the world’s richest individuals, with an estimated net worth of USD 359 billion, according to Forbes. Tesla’s stock has fallen nearly a third since Trump took office, though it remains higher than its value a year ago.Carina Campovasso, a retired federal worker, said during the Boston demonstration, “This government led by Trump and Musk, it’s gone completely off the rails and we are here to stop that. And I hope they listen.”","More than 50 demonstrations took place across US cities, including Tucson, St. Louis, New York City, Dayton, Charlotte, and Palo Alto, with additional protests planned in England, Spain, and Portugal later in March.

'Pitbull' or 'next President'?



'JD is different than Elon'



'He's not speaking loudly': How Trump backed JD



US Vice President JD Vance stole the show of the shouting match between President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday as he triggered the never-seen-before meltdown on television of world leaders when he imparted a lesson of gratitude to Zelenskyy. This is Vance's second major show in international affairs -- as his critics do not call Friday's fallout a win though Zelenskyy softened his stance hours after the ugly spat.A few weeks ago, Vance's unorthodox remarks at the Munich Security Conference signaled a new working style of the US Vice President who did not baulk before accusing European leaders of suppressing free speech and censorship. The White House meeting of Trump, Zelenskyy saw Vance in a new role of a defender of his boss Trump and neither did Trump intervene to diffuse the situation.Accusing Zelenskyy of leading ""propaganda tours"" of the destruction done by Russian invasion, JD Vance said he has been to Ukraine and seen the situation. “I think it’s disrespectful to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media,” Vance said, his voice rising. “You bring people on a propaganda tour, Mr President … Do you think that it’s respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?”“During the war, everyone has problems,” Zelenskyy replied. “But you have nice ocean and don’t feel now. But you will feel it in the future.”It was then that the meeting took an ugly turn and Zelenskyy left the White House without signing the minerals deal.JD Vance is the first choice of the Republicans as the next presidential candidate. Even in the recently concluded CPAC (Conservative Political Action Conference), Vance won 61 per cent support as the presidential candidate for 2028. Vance's strong stance in the Zelenskyy meeting made the call stronger.In fact, Elon Musk called Vance the next president after Vance's interaction with UK Prime Minister Keir Stamer where Vance spoke about free speech.However, Vance was called Donald Trump's 'attack dog', and 'pitbull' as he triggered the face-off.One US official told Reuters that the face-off was the flexing of JD Vance. ""Vance is different than Elon. For him to sit and take on Zelenskyy in front of Trump was a very big moment. He moved to support the president, and Trump loves it when people step out to do the confrontation that he usually does,"" the official said.During the heated argument, Zelenskyy referred to Vance as JD and asked, ""What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?"" Vance called Zelenskyy 'Mr President' and said, ""I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country.""Zelenskyy noted that Vance was speaking loudly but Trump who was enjoying the confrontation stepped in and said, ""He's not speaking loudly."" ""You've done a lot of talking. Your country is in big trouble.""Later in the day, JD Vance did not put any statement on social media after the face-off. He only shared President Trump's statement on the confrontation maintaining a low profile on X.",US Vice President JD Vance stole the show of the shouting match between President Donald Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday.

Which side triggered the biggest trainwreck in modern diplomatic history and what was the provocation is being bitterly contested in interviews and on social media in the hours following the fiasco, with millions of posts on the biggest geo-political debacle in modern times.According to Trump and his MAGA minions, it was Zelenskyy who was rude and ungrateful as he pushed the Trump-Vance team for security guarantees and unloaded on Putin, saying he had repeatedly violated ceasefire agreements. He was speaking to an US MAGA leadership that has openly reversed course from previous administration and has embraced Russia and Putin at the expense of its European allies.There were several points Zelenskyy made which appeared to trigger Trump, particularly when the Ukrainian leader talked of Russia's depredations against Ukraine going back more than a decade to 2014, suggesting that even Trump was part of the US leadership that little to stop Moscow.Trump was also visibly angered when Zelenskyy said the US is protected by two oceans and despite this could feel the heat some day, a remark that some MAGA folk saw as an insidious threat to America. When Trump told him that he was in a lot of trouble and losing the war against Russia, Zelenskyy responded, “First of all, during the war, everybody has problems, even you. But you have nice ocean and don’t feel now. But you will feel it in the future. God bless –”“You don’t know that. You don’t know that. Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel. We’re trying to solve a problem. Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel.”“I’m not telling you. I am answering on these questions.”“Because you’re in no position to dictate that.”“That’s exactly what you’re doing.”“You are in no position to dictate what we’re going to feel. We’re going to feel very good.”“You will feel influenced.”“We are going to feel very good and very strong.”“I am telling you. You will feel influenced.”“You’re, right now, not in a very good position. You’ve allowed yourself to be in a very bad position –”“From the very beginning of the war —”“You’re not in a good position. You don’t have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards.”“I’m not playing cards. I’m very serious, Mr. President. I’m very serious.”“You’re playing cards. You’re gambling with the lives of millions of people. You’re gambling with World War III.”“What are you speaking about?”“You’re gambling with World War III. And what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that’s backed you far more than a lot of people said they should have.”Secretary of State Marco Rubio, among those who did the prep work for the rare minerals deal, said later, ""There was no need for him to go in there and become antagonistic...He should apologize for wasting our time for a meeting to end the way it did.""""Don't come here and create a scenario where you're going to start lecturing us about how diplomacy isn't going to work,"" Rubio said, revealing that it was the Ukrainians who insisted on coming to Washington DC for a deal that could have been signed in Kyiv five days ago.Trump's vice-president JD Vance too seemed to harbor resentment about Zelenskyy purportedly campaigning for Kamala Harris during the 2024 election campaign.“Have you said thank you once?”“A lot of times. Even today.”“No, in this entire meeting. You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October.”“No.”“Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who’s trying to save your country.”“Please. You think that if you will speak very loudly about the war, you can –”“He’s not speaking loudly. He’s not speaking loudly. Your country is in big trouble.”“Can I answer —”“No, no. You’ve done a lot of talking. Your country is in big trouble.”“I know. I know.”“You’re not winning. You’re not winning this. You have a damn good chance of coming out OK because of us.”“Mr. President, we are staying in our country, staying strong. From the very beginning of the war, we’ve been alone. And we are thankful. I said thanks.”Zelenskyy's assertion that Ukraine has been alone also seemed to offend Trump, who claims the US has given $ 350 billion to Kyiv at the expense of American taxpayers, plowing money into a war that is unwinnable.“If you didn’t have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.”“In three days. I heard it from Putin. In three days.”“Maybe less. It’s going to be a very hard thing to do business like this, I tell you.“Just say thank you.”“I said a lot of times, thank you, to American people.”“Accept that there are disagreements, and let’s go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it out in the American media when you’re wrong. We know that you’re wrong.”“But you see, I think it’s good for the American people to see what’s going on. I think it’s very important. That’s why I kept this going so long. You have to be thankful.”“I’m thankful.”“You don’t have the cards. You’re buried there. People are dying. You’re running low on soldiers. It would be a damn good thing, and then you tell us, ‘I don’t want a ceasefire. I don’t want a ceasefire, I want to go, and I want this.’ Look, if you can get a ceasefire right now, I tell you, you take it so the bullets stop flying and your men stop getting killed.”“Of course we want to stop the war. But I said to you, with guarantees.”Trump: “Are you saying you don’t want a ceasefire? I want a ceasefire. Because you’ll get a ceasefire faster than an agreement.”“Ask our people about a ceasefire, what they think.”“That wasn’t with me. That was with a guy named Biden, who is not a smart person.”“This is your president.

Iowa Gender Identity: Iowa becomes first US state to remove gender identity protections under Donald Trump’s administration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/iowa-becomes-first-us-state-to-remove-gender-identity-protections-under-donald-trumps-administration/articleshow/118642648.cms,"Representative Image

Iowa has become the first US state to remove gender identity protections from its civil rights code after governor Kim Reynolds signed a new law on Friday. The move, which takes effect on July 1, has sparked strong opposition from LGBTQ+ advocates who say it could lead to widespread discrimination.The law eliminates gender identity as a protected category under Iowa’s civil rights code, undoing provisions that were added in 2007. It also establishes legal definitions of male and female based on reproductive organs at birth, rejecting the notion that a person can transition to another gender. Republicans backing the bill argue that gender identity protections cannot coexist with policies restricting transgender individuals from using certain bathrooms, locker rooms, or sports teams.“It’s common sense to acknowledge the obvious biological differences between men and women,” Reynolds said in a video posted on social media, defending her decision to sign the bill. She claimed that the previous civil rights code had “blurred the biological line between the sexes.”The bill moved through the Iowa Legislature after being introduced just last week. While all Democrats voted against it, five House Republicans also opposed the measure.Iowa state Representative Aime Wichtendahl, the first openly transgender lawmaker in the state, spoke before the final vote, saying: “I transitioned to save my life. The purpose of this bill and the purpose of every anti-trans bill is to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence.”Hundreds of LGBTQ+ activists gathered at the Iowa Capitol on Thursday, waving signs reading “Trans rights are human rights” and chanting, “No hate in our state!” A heavy police presence was in place. As the final votes were cast, some protesters became visibly emotional.US President Donald Trump , who signed an executive order during his first day in office defining legal sex categories at the federal level, voiced support for the Iowa bill. On Thursday, he posted on Truth Social in favour of the measure after it passed both chambers of the Iowa Legislature.Republican Representative Steven Holt, who backed the bill, justified the removal of gender identity protections by stating that if the Legislature could add them, it could also remove them.Legal experts and advocacy groups, including LGBTQ+ rights organisation One Iowa, have vowed to challenge the law in court. Keenan Crow, the group’s director of policy and advocacy, criticised the bill’s vague language, saying, “We will pursue any legal options available to us.”While not every US state includes gender identity in its civil rights laws, Iowa is now the first to actively strip such protections. The state’s Supreme Court has previously ruled that discrimination based on sex does not automatically include gender identity discrimination.As of July 1, Iowa’s civil rights law will continue to protect individuals from discrimination based on race, colour, creed, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, and disability status—but not gender identity.LGBTQ+ advocacy groups warn that the change could lead to legal battles and increased difficulties for transgender Iowans in employment, housing, and public accommodations.","Iowa has become the first US state to remove gender identity protections from its civil rights code after governor Kim Reynolds signed a new law on Friday.

WASHINGTON: Three civilian aircraft reportedly violated the airspace above US President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, prompting the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) to scramble F-16 fighter jets, according to the Daily Mail.The fighter jets deployed flares and escorted the planes out of the restricted airspace, the report said. It remains unclear why the aircraft entered Palm Beach airspace, though similar incidents have occurred in recent weeks.According to Palm Beach Post, three airspace violations took place during Trump’s visit to Mar-a-Lago in February. Two violations occurred on February 15, while another took place on Presidents Day, February 17. There were also reports of F-16s responding to airspace breaches over Wellington, an inland community, and another civilian aircraft flying into Palm Beach on February 18.NORAD, in its response, stated that the flares used during such incidents are “employed with the highest regard for safety, burn out quickly and completely, and pose no danger to people on the ground.”Meanwhile, Irish Star reported that Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago after the fighter jets had dealt with the airspace violations.In a separate development, Trump claimed that boxes of classified documents seized from his Mar-a-Lago residence during a 2022 FBI investigation had been returned to him. According to AFP, Trump suggested that these documents, which were at the center of an inquiry into his handling of government records, could be displayed in his future presidential library.“The department just returned the boxes that Deranged Jack Smith made such a big deal about,” Trump posted on Truth Social, referring to Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led the case.“They are being brought down to Florida and will someday be part of the Trump Presidential Library,” he added.The Justice Department has not confirmed Trump’s claim regarding the return of the documents.","Three civilian aircraft reportedly violated the airspace above US President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

Grammy-nominated R&B singer Angie Stone , known for hits like Wish I Didn’t Miss You and No More Rain (In This Cloud), died in a car crash early Saturday. She was 63.Stone was traveling back to Atlanta from Alabama when the vehicle she was riding in overturned and was struck by a big rig around 4 am, her longtime manager Walter Millsap III told The Associated Press. While others in the van survived, Stone succumbed to her injuries.Her children, Diamond and Michael Archer, expressed their grief in a statement shared by the SRG Group: “Never in a million years did we ever expect to get this horrible news. We are still trying to process and are completely heartbroken.”Millsap described the loss as “an unexpected and unfortunate tragedy,” adding, “there are simply no words to express how we feel.”Stone had been scheduled to perform at the halftime show of the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) men’s championship basketball game on Saturday. CIAA Chaplain Pastor Jerome Barber led a moment of silence in her honour. Commissioner Jacqie McWilliams-Parker said the league was “heartbroken by the loss” and praised Stone for using her talent to “inspire and touch us with strength and hope.”A trailblazer in hip-hop and R&B, Stone first gained recognition as a member of The Sequence, the pioneering all-female rap trio signed to Sugar Hill Records. Their song Funk You Up became a hip-hop classic, later sampled by artists such as Dr. Dre. She later joined the R&B trio Vertical Hold before launching a successful solo career.Stone was a key figure in the neo-soul movement of the early 2000s alongside Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, Maxwell, and D’Angelo. Her 2001 album Mahogany Soul reached No. 22 on the Billboard 200, while The Art of Love & War (2007) peaked at No. 11. Her collaboration Baby with Betty Wright became a chart-topping hit.Beyond music, Stone ventured into acting, appearing in films such as The Hot Chick, The Fighting Temptations, and Ride Along. She also performed on Broadway in Chicago and appeared on reality shows including Celebrity Fit Club and R&B Divas: Atlanta.Born in Columbia, South Carolina, Stone’s legacy spans decades, from hip-hop’s early days to modern R&B. Her influence, both as a solo artist and as part of The Sequence, remains a defining part of music history.","Stone was traveling back to Atlanta from Alabama when the vehicle she was riding in overturned and was struck by a big rig.

The demonstration forced Vance and his family to relocate to an undisclosed location, Fox News reported.Vance, his wife Usha, and their three children had planned a weekend stay at Sugarbush Resort in Warren, Vermont. However, upon arrival, they were met with thousands of protesters waving pro-Ukraine, anti-Vance signs , accusing him of being sympathetic to Russia. Some banners read, ""Vance is a traitor. Go ski in Russia.""The protests followed a highly publicised meeting between US President Donald Trump and Zelenskyy, which escalated into a rare public showdown. The meeting reportedly remained cordial until Vance confronted Zelenskyy. “I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country,” Vance told Zelenskyy , according to Daily Express US. He also accused the Ukrainian leader of campaigning for Democrats in the 2024 elections and failing to acknowledge US financial aid to Ukraine.While some Republicans supported Vance’s stance, the heated exchange strained US-Ukraine relations, raising concerns about Washington’s commitment to Kyiv.

Friday's tense exchange between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy extended behind closed doors, as the two leaders remained at odds following their heated White House clash.Despite an initial display of public camaraderie, tensions persisted as two leaders saw the removal of the foreign delegation from the White House.US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz provided a firsthand account of the tense moment, when he told ""still argumentative"" Zelenskyy that it was time to leave the White House.Mike Waltz, speaking on Saturday’s “Fox and Friends Weekend,” detailed how he and Secretary of State Marco Rubio escorted Zelenskyy out after the meeting concluded.Reflecting on Friday's events, Waltz questioned whether Zelenskyy “truly wants to stop the fighting,” noting that the situation left Trump “frustrated and angry.”When asked if Zelenskyy appeared to grasp the gravity of the situation, Waltz responded: “No, he didn’t. Frankly, his team did. His ambassador and his adviser were practically – I mean, they were practically in tears wanting this to move forward. But Zelenskyy was still argumentative.”“Time is not on your side here. Time is not on your side on the battlefield. Time is not on your side in terms of the world situation, and, most importantly, US aid and the taxpayers’ tolerance is not unlimited,” Waltz recalled telling Zelenskyy.He further explained “We had a meeting after that exchange after the press was asked to leave, and we pretty much unanimously advised the President that after that insult in the Oval Office, we just do not see how that could move forward, that any further engagement would only go backwards from this moment on, and that’s what we walked over and told President Zelenskyy and his team.”Before the negotiations fell apart, Zelenskyy engaged in an exchange with Trump and Vice President JD Vance .During a Friday CNN appearance, US Secretary of State Rubio stated Zelenskyy should apologise to President Trump ""for turning this thing into the fiasco for him that it became.""""There was no need for him to go in there and become antagonistic,"" Rubio told presenter Kaitlan Collins.In the Friday interview, Rubio questioned Zelenskyy's commitment to ending the conflict, stating: “You start to suspect, does he really want an end to this war? Does he just think that we have to do whatever he says and give him anything he wants without any end game?”The Oval Office meeting initially started on a positive note, with friendly exchanges, including Trump remarking, ""I think he's a great guy,"" in reference to Zelenskyy.However, tensions escalated when Zelenskyy attempted to discuss Russian President Vladimir Putin’s diplomatic stance with Vice President Vance in front of the press.Vance criticized Zelenskyy for what he saw as opportunistic photo ops with Democrats during the 2024 campaign and accused him of disrespecting the administration.Trump, raising his voice, reprimanded Zelenskyy for being ungrateful and insisted he should show more appreciation for US support, stating bluntly, ""You don't have the cards.""Following the meeting, Zelenskyy took to X, posting: “Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people.

When German violinist Christian Tetzlaff returned home to Berlin after a recent performance in Chicago, he was distraught. The concert had gone well, but he was increasingly disturbed by political developments in the United States: President Donald Trump's embrace of Russia, the dizzying cuts to the federal workforce and changes in policies affecting transgender Americans.""I felt like a child watching a horror film,"" he said in an interview.On Friday, Tetzlaff, 58, a renowned violinist who frequently performs in the United States, said that he was canceling an eight-city tour of the country with his quartet this spring -- including a stop at New York City's Carnegie Hall -- and that he was unlikely to perform again in America unless the government reversed course.""There seems to be a quietness or denial about what's going on,"" he said. ""I feel utter anger. I cannot go on with this feeling inside. I cannot just go and play a tour of beautiful concerts.""Harrison W. Fields, a White House spokesperson, offered a two-word response to Tetzlaff's cancellation: ""America first.""Tetzlaff is one of the first major foreign artists to try to use a cultural boycott to influence Trump's policies during his second term.For decades, American artists have canceled tours as a means of protesting war, autocracy, injustice and discrimination abroad. There were cultural boycotts of South Africa in the 1970s and 1980s in protest of its policy of apartheid, and more recently, artists have refused to perform in Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Now, with the Trump administration dramatically remaking both domestic and foreign policy in its first 100 days, some performers are employing the tactic and turning the tables: canceling performances in the United States.It is unclear if the strategy will have much impact on the highly polarized political environment in America. The vast majority of foreign artists have kept their engagements.Tetzlaff said he hoped to start a conversation.""I pay 32% taxes on every concert I play in the United States,"" he said. ""That goes, at the moment, to a state that does partially horrible things with the money. And so to complain and then to say, 'I take my money and go home' -- that's also not good.""Many artists, especially those from Europe, have been alarmed by Trump's embrace of Russia and his criticism of Ukraine in his second term. Just last week, Trump falsely asserted that Ukraine ""started"" the war with Russia and called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a ""dictator without elections."" On Friday, Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Zelenskyy in an unusually fractious White House meeting, accusing him of not being grateful enough for U.S. support.Tetzlaff said the US government was betraying Ukraine -- and that its new approach to the conflict was a major factor in his decision to cancel his appearances.""Have the American people forgotten the pictures and tales of the scores of slain civilians in every town the Russians invaded?"" he said.Tetzlaff, who was to appear in March with his ensemble, the Tetzlaff Quartet, in New York, Connecticut, Georgia and California, said he was also likely to cancel his engagements planned this summer and fall in the United States. He added that he would be open to performing benefit concerts in the United States for Ukraine or for groups that support women's rights.""Anything that could help mend wounds in society or to help people who are being slighted now,"" he said.Tetzlaff first performed in the United States in 1988 and has about 20 engagements here each year. Calling America a ""big part of my musical life,"" he said he would be saddened to add it to the list of countries where he does not perform. That list includes China and Russia, which he has avoided because of government policies.Tetzlaff said that he had consulted friends and colleagues and that many disagreed with his decision, saying that music could help bring people together. But he said he was inspired partly by the example of composers such as Ludwig van Beethoven, Johannes Brahms and Béla Bartók, whose music touched on themes of freedom and individuality.""I cannot see myself as an entertainer; it's not our aim to please an audience so they go home and say, 'This was a lovely evening,' with a good glass of red wine,"" he said. ""Music sends messages about the human condition, about empathy and the heart. We have to uphold these ideals.""","Violinist Christian Tetzlaff says he is canceling an eight-city tour of the U.S. He is one of the first major foreign artists to try to use a cultural boycott to influence Trump's policies.

Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has officially launched his bid for mayor of New York City, shaking up an already competitive Democratic primary and posing a serious challenge to incumbent Mayor Eric Adams .Cuomo, who resigned in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations , enters the race as the immediate frontrunner, leveraging his name recognition and Adams’ declining popularity. His announcement follows months of speculation, during which he quietly consolidated support among key political figures and donors.“The city just feels threatening, out of control,” Cuomo said in a nearly 18-minute campaign video. “These conditions exist not as an act of God, but rather as an act of our political leaders.”While Cuomo’s comeback has been met with skepticism due to his past scandals—including the nursing home controversy during Covid-19 and the sexual misconduct claims—his moderate stance sets him apart from the progressive candidates in the race.Rival candidates, including City Comptroller Brad Lander and Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, quickly criticized Cuomo, highlighting his past controversies. “He resigned for sexually harassing 13 women and leading thousands of elderly New Yorkers to their deaths during Covid-19,” Lander posted on social media.Polls suggest Cuomo holds a strong lead, with one survey showing him securing 51% of ranked-choice votes. However, when respondents were reminded of his scandals, his support dropped to 19%.With Adams’ approval ratings plummeting and the June 24 primary approaching, Cuomo’s entry signals a high-stakes battle for City Hall. The winner will likely face Republican Curtis Sliwa in the November general election.","Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has officially launched his bid for mayor of New York City.

Mullah Omer, the slain founder of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, was also an alumni of this religious school.Graduates of the seminary include current Afghan Taliban leaders Amir Khan Muttaqi, Sirajuddin Haqqani, Abdul Latif Mansoor, Maulvi Ahmad Jan, Mullah Jalaludin Haqani, Maulvi Qalamudin, Arifullah Arif and Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa.The explosion occurred in the main prayer hall as people gathered for weekly Friday prayers were leaving the mosque.KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed confirmed that it was a suicide attack and that three policemen were also injured. “More than a dozen police officers were guarding the mosque when the attack occurred, and Haq’s seminary also had its own security,” he said.“It appears that Hamid Haqqani (seminary’s slain chief) was the target,” Hameed added.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, which came on the last Friday ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Yawar Zia, a police constable, who was injured in the attack, said he was on security duty at the seminary when the blast happened and splinters hit him. “After offering prayer, Hamid-ul-Haq, accompanied by his guards, was leaving the mosque when the powerful explosion occurred,” the wounded official said.Eyewitnesses described a chaotic scene, with blood and body parts scattered all over the place. They said the casualties could have been much higher had the bomber struck during the prayers.Haqqani, the son of slain prominent Pakistani cleric Sami-ul-Haq Haqqani, known as the “father of Taliban, was a vice-chancellor of the sprawling seminary, located 60 km from the provincial capital of Peshawar. Following his father’s assassination in 2018, he also became chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Sami (JUI-S) political party. He had also previously served as a member of the National Assembly from 2002 to 2007.Haq was also among the few who called on the world and Pakistan to immediately recognise the Taliban govt and establish diplomatic relations with Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul in 2021.Last year, he led a delegation of religious scholars to Afghanistan for “religious diplomacy” meetings with Taliban leaders.His seminary had faced controversy in the past as its students were accused of involvement in the assassination of Pakistan’s former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. The madrasa, however, denied any connection with the suspects.","At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque.

China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong , marking the first time a foreign national will be aboard the facility.The deal was signed in a ceremony held in Islamabad on Friday, between the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) and Pakistan’s Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO). Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was alos present during the ceremony.According to a statement by CMSA, both nations will collaborate on selecting and training Pakistani astronauts, with the chosen candidate expected to join Chinese taikonauts for a short-term mission in the coming years.""This signifies a major step in China’s international space cooperation ,"" reported Global Times, highlighting the growing partnership between Beijing and Islamabad in aerospace advancements.China’s space station, which has been operational for nearly four years, was built after the country was reportedly excluded from the International Space Station (ISS) due to concerns over the involvement of China’s military in its space programme.The station is also seen as a new frontier of competition between China and the US.As per the news agency PTI, the agreement further solidifies China’s support for Pakistan’s space ambitions, following previous collaborations such as the launch of Pakistani satellites.Pakistan’s first digital communications satellite, Badr-1, was launched aboard a Chinese Long March 2E rocket in 1990, while earlier this year, Pakistan’s CubeSat accompanied China’s Chang’e-6 probe to the Moon.According to Global Times, the selection of the astronaut is expected to take around a year, after which the candidate will undergo intensive training in China. This move, experts say, demonstrates the reliability of China's manned space technology and its willingness to lower barriers for developing countries to participate in space exploration .China has also set ambitious goals for space exploration, with plans to land astronauts on the Moon before 2030.Meanwhile, the US has its sights set on returning to the lunar surface by 2025.","China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong.

A top cleric and four worshippers were killed and several injured after a blast ripped through a madrassa Darul Uloom Haqqania located in Pakistan 's Akkora Khattak district, which is in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, according to AP news agency.Emergency responders, Rescue 1122 have arrived at the location, and law enforcement authorities have initiated their investigation into the incident.Abdul Rashid, a district police chief said that the officers are investigating the case.Meanwhile, rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Faizi confirmed to Dawn that 20 people have been injured and have been taken to hospital.The explosion took place during Friday prayers in the madrassa's main hall, with authorities declaring an emergency in Nowshera , as confirmed by Dawn's KP Bureau Chief, Ali Akbar.Speaking to Samaa TV, KP's Inspector General, Zulfiqar Hameed, said, ""It appears to be a suicide blast, as per initial investigations. Some are injured and some are among the martyrs.""""It appears that Maulana Hamidul Haq Haqqani was the target,"" the KP IG told Samaa TV.Maulana Haqqani, who leads JUI-S as its chief, is the firstborn of the late Maulana Samiul Haq. His credentials include being a political figure and Islamic academic, with a tenure in the National Assembly spanning from November 2002 to 2007. Following his father's tragic death, he assumed the roles of vice chancellor at Jamia Darul Uloon Haqqania and chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (Sami).The madressah was established by Islamic scholar Maulana Abdul Haq Haqqani in September 1947, according to the institution's website.Previously, the Madrassa faced scrutiny when its students were alleged to be involved in former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's assassination. However, the madrassa has consistently denied any links to the suspects.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif issued a firm condemnation of the incident and offered prayers for Maulana Haq and other casualties' recovery, as stated by the Prime Minister's Office.He instructed authorities to provide excellent medical care to the wounded individuals and requested a detailed incident report.""Such cowardly and heinous acts of terrorism cannot dampen our resolve against terrorism,"" the PM said.

Clock running out for refugees in Islamabad, Rawalpindi



'We've worked with the Americans for years'



Kabul, Islamabad row amid rising crackdown



Forced to move after decades in Pakistan



UN says Pakistan has a tradition of protecting Afghans

A woman who we will call Fatima fled Afghanistan with her family in December 2021. She had worked for an American non-profit organization in Kabul ­until the US pullout in the summer of 2021, when the Taliban retook control of the country.She is now based in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. And she is in trouble. Her Pakistani visa is days away from expiring, and the authorities are still processing her renewal application.""I am concerned about the renewal of my visa, and if not renewed timely authorities would arrest me and my family for illegally residing in the country,"" Fatima told DW.Police, including female officers, recently conducted a raid on a building where Fatima lives, looking for undocumented Afghan refugees. She was not in the building at the time, but her brother ended up in custody.""Later, we showed them our visa renewal application receipts and proof but police did not cooperate,"" said Fatima, who is now hiding from the authorities.In 2023, Pakistan started a massive initiative to repatriate approximately 4 million Afghans who have entered the country over the past 40 years. And while the authorities granted some leeway last year, Pakistan's government has now set a March 31 deadline to expel foreign nationals residing in the country illegally, with search operations ongoing in January and February.Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi ""have been verbally asked to leave Pakistan till 28th February,"" Umer Gillani, a legal expert and rights activist, told DW.Moniza Kakar, a lawyer working for refugees advocacy in Pakistan, said there was ""uncertainty and fear"" among the Afghani nationals in the area.""Since the start of this year, over 1,000 Afghans have been detained in Islamabad, and more than 18,000 have been forced to leave Islamabad and Rawalpindi because of government orders,"" she said.Amin, 28, is from Kabul. He spent years collaborating with the United States in the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan, before he too had to flee across the Pakistani border.Hee said he was just days away from being evacuated to America, but this was put on hold last month with President Donald Trump signing an executive order to suspend a refugee resettlement program.Nearly 20,000 Afghans are presently waiting in Pakistan for approval to resettle in the US through an American government program.""We've worked with the Americans for years, we helped and supported them in Afghanistan, we have given them a part of our lives and they have to support us so that we can live peacefully,"" Amin told DW.Over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with neighboring Afghanistan has deteriorated. Islamabad holds the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan responsible for their inability to control the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions with the Taliban regime escalate, concerns were also raised about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan amid reports of purported intimidation and arrests. The UN special rapporteur has expressed his worries, stating that Afghans in the area deserve more humane treatment.Activist Gilani said millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan are being used as ""hostages to build pressure whenever there is tension between the two countries.""Last week, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry dismissed claims made by the Afghan representation regarding the mistreatment of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, labeling these allegations as ""misplaced"" and urging Kabul to facilitate the smooth repatriation of Afghan citizens.Pakistan has accommodated hundreds of thousands of refugees from its northern neighbor, a situation resulting from decades of regional instability. Afghans who arrived in Pakistan following the Taliban takeover in August 2021 have been relying on visa renewals to stay in the country, a procedure that is costly, uncertain and often subject to significant delays.""The stories of refugees are devastating. Families who have lived in Pakistan for years, even decades, are now being uprooted due to tensions between the two countries. Children, women, and men who have already suffered so much are being treated as if they don't matter. This is not just a refugee crisis, it's a humanitarian crisis,"" said Kakar.UNHCR's top representative in Pakistan, Philippa Candler, told DW that Pakistan already repatriated over 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year.""As of December 2024, Pakistan hosted over 2.8 million Afghans with 69% of refugees living outside refugee villages,"" she said.Candler acknowledged Pakistan's generosity in hosting Afghan refugees for decades, and the current ""economic and security challenges"" in Pakistan that drive the repatriation efforts.At the same time, UNHCR was urging the Islamabad government to ""see the situation of Afghans through a humanitarian perspective"" and ""continue its long-standing tradition of protecting vulnerable Afghans […] regardless of their status.""""It's essential that we work hand-in-hand with both host countries and countries of origin to develop mechanisms that empower refugees to rebuild their lives in safety and dignity, including voluntary repatriation,"" she said.""We are calling for dialogue between the two countries, and for the refugee issue to be separated from political matters.""","Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi are in trouble. Pakistan's government has now set a March 31 deadline to expel foreign nationals residing in the country illegally.

New York City is terminating a $220m deal with the Pakistan-owned Roosevelt Hotel to house a migrant shelter following a prolonged MAGA meltdown over use of American taxpayer money to facilitate immigration to the US.Under pressure from the federal government and MAGA hardliners, Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who gravitated to the Trump orbit after facing corruption charges from the Biden administration, announced closure of the site that is said to have housed tens of thousands of migrants in its 1025 rooms at $ 200 a night.The site opened in May 2023 to serve as both a new arrivals center and shelter for asylum seekers under a three-year $ 220 million deal with government-run Pakistan International Airlines, which owns the hotel, having bought out a Saudi stake in it for $ 36.4million in 2005.At peak traffic in 2023 when around 4000 migrants were arriving in the city each week, the sight of asylum seekers camping outside the hotel waiting to be processed triggered MAGA hardliners and even some New Yorkers, as Trump and his supporters complained about Democrats housing ""illegal immigrants"" in ""luxury hotels"" at the expense of US taxpayers.""A taxpayer-funded hotel for illegal migrants is owned by the Pakistani government, which means NYC taxpayers are effectively paying a foreign government to house illegals in our own country.

"No passengers, no planes: China-funded $240m Gwadar airport sits idle",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-passengers-no-planes-china-funded-240m-gwadar-airport-sits-idle/articleshow/118512631.cms,"Gwadar airport in Pakistan (Pic credit: AP)

With no passengers and no planes, Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport is a bit of a mystery. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million, it's anyone's guess when New Gwadar International Airport will open for business. Located in the coastal city of Gwadar and completed in Oct 2024, its a stark contrast to the impoverished, restive southwestern Balochistan province around it.For the past decade, China has poured money into Balochistan and Gwadar as part of a multibillion dollar project that connects its western Xinjiang province with Arabian Sea, called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC.Authorities have hailed it as transformational but there's scant evidence of change in Gwadar. The city isn't connected to the national grid - electricity comes from Iran or solar panels - and there isn't enough clean water. An airport with a 400,000 passenger capacity isn't a priority for the city's 90,000 people.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" said Azeem Khalid, an international relations expert who specialises in Pakistan-China ties. ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""CPEC has catalysed a decadeslong insurgency in resource-rich and strategically located Balochistan. Separatists, aggrieved by what they say is state exploitation at the expense of locals, are fighting for independence - targeting Pakistani troops and Chinese workers in the province and elsewhere. Members of Pakistan's ethnic Baloch minority say they face discrimination by govt and are denied opportunities available elsewhere in the country, charges govt denies.Pakistan, keen to protect China's investments, has stepped up its military footprint in Gwadar to combat dissent. The city is a jumble of checkpoints, barbed wire, troops, barricades, and watchtowers. Roads close at any given time, several days a week, to permit the safe passage of Chinese workers and Pakistani VIPs.Intelligence officers monitor journalists visiting Gwadar. Its fish market is deemed too sensitive for coverage.Many locals are frazzled. ""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" said Khuda Bakhsh Hashim, 76. ""We used to enjoy all-night picnics in the mountains or rural areas. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Hashim recalled when Gwadar was part of Oman, not Pakistan, and was a stop for passenger ships heading to Mumbai. People didn't go hungry and found work easily, he said.But Gwadar's water has dried up because of drought and unchecked exploitation. So has the work. Govt says CPEC has created some 2,000 local jobs but it's not clear whom they mean by ""local"" - Baloch residents or Pakistanis from elsewhere in the country. Authorities did not elaborate.There is a perception Gwadar is dangerous or difficult to visit - only one commercial route operates out of its domestic airport, three times a week to Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. There are no direct flights to Balochistan's provincial capital of Quetta, or national capital of Islamabad.Security concerns delayed the inauguration of the international airport. There were fears the area's mountains - and their proximity to the airport - could be the ideal launchpad for an attack. Instead, PM Shehbaz Sharif and his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang hosted a virtual ceremony. The inaugural flight was off limits to media and public.","Gwadar is Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million.

ISLAMABAD: A mob enraged by a local’s murder over a trivial parking dispute snatched the suspect, a watchman, from police and lynched him in the mountainous Galiyat region of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Sunday. Several police officers were wounded in the violence in a neighbourhood under the jurisdiction of Changla Gali police station, around 80km from Islamabad.Police said Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home. When he returned the next day, he got into a fight with the watchman, Khan Zaman, who allegedly stabbed him to death and wounded his brother.As word spread about the murder, a mob milled in the area and burned down five houses in the residential society.Police apprehended the culprit, who was hiding in the basement of a building, and were about to take him away when the mob swooped on him and beat him to death with sticks and stones.Lynchings are common in Pakistan and several instances of mob violence have taken place in the past decade. Many people have been lynched for alleged blasphemy, while mobs have also murdered suspects in street crimes.In June 2024, a suspected robber was lynched by a mob in the southern port city of Karachi. The suspect, armed with a pistol, had attempted to rob a citizen, who put up resistance and was joined by others standing nearby. The mob got hold of the suspect and hit him with blunt weapons, resulting in his death on the spot.In May 2024, another mob lynched a suspected robber in Karachi's Orangi town while police saved his accomplice from being killed.The same month, police rescued a Christian man from angry people, who wanted to lynch him and attacked the homes of other minority members in Punjab’s Sargodha district on charges of alleged blasphemy. Workers at a Sialkot garment factory tortured and burned to death their Sri Lankan general manager in 2023 for alleged blasphemy.","Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home.
