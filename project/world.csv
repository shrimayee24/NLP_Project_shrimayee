Trudeau: AI attack reminder of shared duty to condemn terror,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trudeau-ai-attack-reminder-of-shared-duty-to-condemn-terror/articleshow/111239777.cms,"NEW DELHI: Paying homage to the victims of the Air India Kanishka bombing , Canadian PM Justin Trudeau said it remains the deadliest terrorist attack in Canadian history, and a reminder of the shared responsibility to unequivocally condemn terrorism . The two sides paid their respects to the 329 victims, 280 of them Canadians, amid growing strife in bilateral ties caused, as India has repeatedly said, by the political space given by Canadian authorities to Khalistan extremists who advocate violence against India.Earlier on Sunday, the Indian high commission in Ottawa said in a press release, while remembering the victims, that the bombing was a cowardly act of terror, carried out by Canada-based Khalistani terrorists.Stating that perpetrators and co-conspirators of the dastardly act remained free, the Indian mission said any act of glorifying terrorism including the bombing of AI-182, in 1985, is deplorable and should be condemned by all peace-loving countries and people. ""It is unfortunate that such actions are allowed to be routine on many occasions in Canada,'' said the statement. Foreign minister S Jaishankar had said on Sunday in a post on social media that the anniversary is a reminder why terrorism should never be tolerated. Canada has observed the anniversary of the June 23, 1985, terrorist attack since 2005 as National Day of Remembrance for Victims of Terrorism. ""Today, we remember and honour every Canadian whose life was cut short or forever changed by a terrorist attack,'' said Trudeau in his message.""Thirty-nine years ago today, 329 innocent people, including 280 Canadians, tragically lost their lives when a bomb, planted on Air India Flight 182 in Canada, exploded mid-flight. This remains the deadliest terrorist attack in Canadian history. It reminds us of the senseless violence that terrorism perpetuates and of our shared responsibility to unequivocally condemn terrorism,'' he added. Trudeau further said Canada is doing its part to counter terrorism and violent extremism and has updated its counter-terrorism strategy. While he made no special mention of Khalistan extremism, the Canadian PM cited the example of how his govt has listed Iran's IRGC under Canada's Criminal Code. ""On this day - and every day - we stand united against hate, intolerance, and division. We reaffirm Canada's determination to fight against violent extremism and keep our people safe,'' Trudeau said.","The two sides paid their respects to the 329 victims, 280 of them Canadians.

Our position has not changed. The second thing, which does not contradict the first, we will not end the war until we eliminate Hamas ,"" Netanyahu said in a speech to parliament.His statement came after facing an angry backlash from Israeli politicians and a group representing Israel’s hostages and their families who felt that the PM will make a partial deal with Hamas to return only some hostages from Gaza.On a local channel, Netanyahu expressed his willingness to strike ""a partial deal"" with Hamas, which would only involve the repatriation of a few hostages from Gaza. This stance contradicts the proposal that had been endorsed by his own war cabinet, according to CNN.US President Joe Biden presented a plan last month that delineates prerequisites aimed at securing the freedom of all remaining captives in exchange for a lasting truce and the pullout of Israeli troops from Gaza.The families, together with the hostages and missing families forum released a video on Monday where all three hostages, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, Eliya Cohen, 26, and Or Levy, 33, who were abducted on October 7, were being driven along a tree-lined road in southern Israel by militants wielding assault weapons.The families of the young men, desperate for PM Netanyahu to agree to a hostage deal with Islamist group Hamas, approved its publication in the media.Levy, Cohen, and Goldberg-Polin were among the attendees of the Nova music festival in southern Israel when the Hamas-led assault occurred. Tragically, Levy's wife was killed during the attack, while Cohen's girlfriend survived despite being buried under a pile of bodies.In the video, Goldberg-Polin, having lost part of his left arm earlier, sits in the back of the pickup truck, covered in blood. The footage alternates between the wounded hostages and their cheering captors as the truck speeds along a narrow road under a clear blue sky.The attack on October 7 triggered the war in Gaza, which has been ongoing for nearly nine months. Attempts to establish a ceasefire and secure the release of approximately 120 hostages still in captivity have been unsuccessful.Jon Polin, Goldberg-Polin's father, stated that they first viewed this latest video of his abduction a week ago, and its release was intended to remind the world about the captives whose lives hang in the balance. He expressed the desire to urge world leaders to take action and secure the release of the hostages.Netanyahu responded to the video, acknowledging the heartbreak it causes and emphasizing the cruelty of the enemy they have vowed to defeat. He pledged not to end the war until all 120 loved ones are brought home safely.After Israeli's PM statement, Israel's military also issued a statement from a situational assessment by its chief of staff in the area of Rafah, where Israeli forces have been fighting Hamas' remaining battalions.""We are clearly approaching the point where we can say we have dismantled the Rafah Brigade, that it is defeated not in the sense that there are no more terrorists, but in the sense that it can no longer function as a fighting unit,"" said Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi.Hamas's deputy chief in Gaza, Khalil Al-Hayya, said: ""We are a people on its land and a resistance (group) defending its land.

Luxury yacht crew sparks devastating wildfire on one of Jeff Bezos’ favourite islands; over 70 acres of forest destroyed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/luxury-yacht-crew-sparks-devastating-wildfire-on-one-of-jeff-bezos-favourite-islands-over-70-acres-of-forest-destroyed/articleshow/111245222.cms,"This is an AI-generated image (Pic credit: Copilot)

A group of workers and passengers on a luxurious yacht called the Persefoni I was taken into custody for allegedly triggering a devastating wildfire on the Greek island of Hydra.

The incident occurred on Friday night, just days after Jeff Bezos , his fiancee Lauren Sanchez, and his son Preston had celebrated Father's Day on the island, which is known to be one of Bezos' preferred destinations, according to a report from New York Post.

According to local reports, the crew members had set off fireworks to amuse the guests onboard, despite the US Embassy and Consulate in Greece issuing a Natural Disaster Alert earlier that day, cautioning the public about the high risk of wildfires due to the extreme temperatures in the region. The resulting blaze destroyed over 70 acres of forest on the island.

The accused individuals were arrested when they docked near Athens on Saturday. They have denied any involvement in the incident. Greece has recently strengthened its laws and penalties related to arson, with offenders facing up to 20 years in prison and a substantial fine exceeding $200,000.

Hydra Island has long been a favoured destination for celebrities, known for its ability to inspire various artists and musicians, including the likes of Leonard Cohen and Picasso.

But he said fewer troops would be needed in Gaza, freeing up forces to battle Hezbollah.The Iranian-backed Hezbollah began striking Israel almost immediately after Hamas' Oct 7 attack that triggered the Gaza war. Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire nearly every day since then, but the fighting has escalated in recent weeks, raising fears of a full-blown war.Netanyahu said he hoped a diplomatic solution to the crisis could be found but vowed to solve the problem ""in a different way"" if needed. ""We can fight on several fronts and we are prepared to do that.""Hezbollah warned Israel last week against launching war on Lebanon's front, saying it has new weapons and intelligence capabilities that could help it target critical positions deeper inside Israel.Hezbollah already has unveiled new weapons during the low-level fighting, including hard-to-defend attack drones that strike with little warning. An Israeli soldier was badly wounded Sunday in a drone strike.","Israeli PM Netanyahu says the ""intense phase"" of fighting against Hamas in Gaza is winding down.

Lawsuit challenges new Louisiana law requiring classrooms to display the Ten Commandments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/lawsuit-challenges-new-louisiana-law-requiring-classrooms-to-display-the-ten-commandments/articleshow/111245547.cms,"BATON ROUGE: Civil liberties groups filed a lawsuit Monday to block Louisiana's new law that requires the Ten Commandments to be displayed in every public school classroom, a measure they contend is unconstitutional.Plaintiffs in the suit include parents of Louisiana public school children with various religious backgrounds, who are represented by attorneys with the American civil liberties union foundation , Americans United for separation of church and state , the freedom from religion foundation and the New York City law firm Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett.""This display sends a message to my children and other students that people of some religious dominations are superior to others,"" said the Rev. Jeff Simms, a Presbyterian pastor who is a plaintiff in the suit and father of three children in Louisiana public schools. ""This is religious favouritism.""Under the legislation signed into law by Republican gov. Jeff Landry last week, all public K-12 classrooms and state-funded universities will be required to display a poster-sized version of the Ten Commandments in ""large, easily readable font"" next year.Opponents argue that the law is a violation of separation of church and state and that the display will isolate students, especially those who are not Christian. Proponents say the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the language of the law, the Ten Commandments are ""foundational documents of our state and national government.""Plaintiff Joshua Herlands has two young children in New Orleans public schools who, like their father, are Jewish. There are multiple versions of the Ten Commandments, and Herlands said the specific version mandated for classroom walls does not align with the version from his faith. He worries the display will send a troubling message to his kids and others that ""they may be lesser in the eyes of the government.""""Politicians have absolutely no business forcing their religious beliefs on my kids or any kids, or attempting to indoctrinate them with what they think is the right version of a particular piece of religious text,"" Herlands said.The lawsuit filed Monday seeks a court declaration that the new law, referred to in the lawsuit as HB 71, violates First Amendment clauses forbidding government establishment of religion and guaranteeing religious liberty. It also seeks an order prohibiting the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms.""The state's main interest in passing H.B. 71 was to impose religious beliefs on public-school children, regardless of the harm to students and families,"" the lawsuit says. ""The law's primary sponsor and author, representative Dodie Horton, proclaimed during debate over the bill that it 'seeks to have a display of God's law in the classroom for children to see what He says is right and what He says is wrong.'""Defendants include state superintendent of education Cade Brumley, members of the state education board and some local school boards.Landry and Louisiana attorney general Elizabeth Murrill support the new law, and Murrill has said she is looking forward to defending it. She issued a statement saying she couldn't comment directly on the lawsuit because she had not yet seen it.""It seems the ACLU only selectively cares about the First Amendment - it doesn't care when the Biden administration censors speech or arrests pro-life protesters, but apparently it will fight to prevent posters that discuss our own legal history,"" Murrill said in the emailed statement.The Ten Commandments have long been at the center of lawsuits across the nation.In 1980, the US supreme court ruled that a similar Kentucky law violated the establishment clause of the US constitution, which says Congress can ""make no law respecting an establishment of religion."" The high court found that the law had no secular purpose, but rather served a plainly religious purpose.In a more recent ruling, the Supreme Court held in 2005 that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution. At the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds of the Texas state Capitol in Austin. Those were 5–4 decisions, but the court's makeup has changed, with a 6-3 conservative majority now.Although some people think this case may rise to the level of the US supreme court and test the conservative members, lawyers for the plaintiffs say that they think this is a clear-cut case""We think this is already covered by clear supreme court precedent,"" said Patrick Elliott, the legal director for the freedom from religion foundation. ""We think under current law that we will prevail, and it would not be necessary for the supreme court to review it.""Other states, including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah, have attempted to pass requirements that the schools display the Ten Commandments. However, with threats of legal battles, none has the mandate in place except for Louisiana.The posters in Louisiana, which will be paired with a four-paragraph ""context statement"" describing how the Ten Commandments ""were a prominent part of public education for almost three centuries,"" must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025.The controversial law comes during a new era of conservative leadership in Louisiana under Landry, who replaced two-term democratic gov. John Bel Edwards in January. The GOP holds a supermajority in the legislature, and republicans hold every statewide elected position, paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda.The case was allotted to US district judge John deGravelles, nominated to the federal bench by former president Barack Obama.","Civil liberties groups file lawsuit to block Louisiana's new law.

'Requires finding': Judge talks tough on plea seeking gag order against Trump in secret document case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/requires-finding-judge-talks-tough-on-plea-seeking-gag-order-against-trump-in-secret-document-case/articleshow/111245140.cms,"'Attacks are against Biden'

A Flordia court judge snubbed prosecutors seeking to frame former US President Donald Trump over his repeated comments on FBI , which the lawyers said had led to a threat against law enforcement officers.During the hearing in the classified document case, Jack Smith 's special counsel argued that Trump's comments mandated a gag order as he ""repeatedly and misleadingly"" alleged that FIB agents who searched his Flordia estate Mar-a-Lago had orders to murder him.Judge Aileen Cannon didn't appear to take the prosecutors' argument at face value as she asked them to show any facts linking what Trump said and the threats the prosecutors warned about.The judge noted that the rules cited by the prosecutors to seek a gag order ""still requires a finding"" related to the potential risks to others. However, she held that prosecutors didn't need a direct cause.""There still needs to be a factual connection between A and B,"" Cannon was quoted as saying by CNN.Prosecutor David Harbach further argued that Trump's other comments ""ultimately result in all types of terrible things"".Batting for the safety of FBI agents involved in the case, David said there should be a cap on Trump's campaign.Defending Trump over his comments, his attorney Todd Blanche said there were no threats to FBI agents as cited by the prosecutors and argued that the government was trying to punish Trump for other people's remarks.""The attacks, very clearly, are against President Biden,"" Blanche was quoted as saying by CNN.Blanche also acknowledged that the Department of Justice's ""deadly force"" policy during the Mar-a-Lago search was standard for executing search warrants but argued that it may not have been appropriate for agents to be armed.The defense attorney also expressed concern that prosecutors are setting a ""dangerous precedent"" by attempting to alter the former president’s conditions of release.He stated that prosecutors are too vaguely defining what constitutes a threat, which complicates adherence to potential new rules and risks making him liable for others’ comments.""Steve Bannon making a comment is potentially the kind of thing that could send President Trump to jail,"" Blanche said on CNN.Trump faces dozens of felony counts accusing him of illegally hoarding at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, classified documents that he took with him after he left the White House in 2021, and then obstructing the FBI's efforts to get them back. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.Trump faces four criminal cases as he seeks to reclaim the White House, but outside of the ongoing New York hush money prosecution, it's not clear that any of the other three will reach trial before the election.",Judge Aileen Cannon didn't appear to take the prosecutors' argument at face value as she asked them to show any facts linking what Trump said and the threats the prosecutors warned about.

"'Julian Assange is free', has left Britain: WikiLeaks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-to-plead-guilty-in-deal-with-us-authorities/articleshow/111243655.cms,"What led to Julian Assange's release?

How was Assange released from Belmarsh prison?

What role did global campaigns play in Assange's release?

What does the deal with the US Department of Justice entail?

What are the charges against Julian Assange?

What was Assange's life like during his time in custody?

What are the next steps for Julian Assange?

What has been the reaction to Assange's release?

How has Assange's imprisonment affected him?

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been released from Belmarsh high-security prison in southeast London after five years in British custody. His wife, Stella Assange, expressed her gratitude to campaigners for their support, sharing the news on the social media platform X. ""Julian is free!!!!"" she wrote, adding, ""Words cannot express our immense gratitude"" to everyone who supported the global push for his release.Assange's release marks a significant turn in a prolonged legal battle that began with his detention for skipping bail related to Swedish sexual assault charges, which were later dropped. Assange, who was accused of disclosing US military secrets, had been fighting extradition to the United States.Assange's mother said his ""ordeal is finally coming to an end"", in a statement to Australian media following news of a plea deal for his release.""I am grateful that my son's ordeal is finally coming to an end. This shows the importance and power of quiet diplomacy,"" Christine Assange said in a statementHere is all you need to know Assange, his impriosnment and release:Assange was released after the UK High Court granted him bail. WikiLeaks announced, ""Julian Assange is free. He left Belmarsh maximum security prison on the morning of June 24, after having spent 1,901 days there."" This decision followed a successful appeal against his extradition to the US.Assange was granted bail by the UK High Court and left Belmarsh prison on the morning of June 24. He was released at Stansted airport in the afternoon, where he boarded a plane and departed the UK.WikiLeaks emphasized the impact of sustained global campaigns: ""This is the result of a global campaign that spanned grass-roots organisers, press freedom campaigners, legislators and leaders from across the political spectrum, all the way to the United Nations."" These efforts created the space for negotiations with the US Department of Justice, leading to a deal.While the deal has not been formally finalized, it allows Assange to plead guilty to a single count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified US national defense documents. He is expected to be sentenced to 62 months of time already served.In 2010, WikiLeaks published a vast collection of classified US military documents related to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, marking the most significant security breaches in US military history. The release also included a substantial number of diplomatic cables.The indictment against Assange was brought forth during the administration of former President Donald Trump, stemming from WikiLeaks' extensive disclosure of confidential US documents. These documents were originally leaked by Chelsea Manning, a former U.S. military intelligence analyst who faced prosecution under the Espionage Act.The released documents, numbering over 700,000, encompassed diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts. Among them was a 2007 video depicting a U.S. Apache helicopter opening fire on suspected insurgents in Iraq, resulting in the deaths of twelve individuals, including two Reuters news staff. The video was made public in 2010.Assange is due to plead guilty to violating US espionage law, specifically conspiring to obtain and disseminate classified national defense information. The charges stem from WikiLeaks' 2010 release of classified US military documents related to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.Assange spent 1,901 days in Belmarsh prison. He married his wife Stella while in custody and will now be reunited with her and their two children. Stella Assange thanked supporters, saying, ""Julian paid severely for these principles, and for the people's right to know.""Assange will appear in US federal court in the Northern Mariana Islands to plead guilty. Following his plea and sentencing, he is expected to return to Australia.WikiLeaks has expressed immense gratitude for the support from various quarters, including grassroots organizers, press freedom advocates, and political leaders. The Australian government, which has been advocating for Assange's release, had no immediate comment. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has previously stated, ""Mr. Assange’s case has dragged on for too long and there is nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration.""Assange's family and supporters have noted that his physical and mental health have suffered during his legal battles and years in confinement. WikiLeaks acknowledged, ""Julian paid severely for these principles, and for the people's right to know,"" highlighting the toll of his imprisonment.(With inputs from agencies)","WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been released from Belmarsh high-security prison in southeast London.

It was shocking. The practice was absolutely unacceptable. Humans should never be used as human shields.""""The IDF should swiftly investigate what happened, hold people accountable,"" Miller said, using an acronym for the Israel Defense Forces.On Saturday, Israeli army forces tied a wounded Palestinian man to the hood of a military jeep during an arrest raid in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin, the Israeli military said.The video circulating on social media and verified by Reuters showed a Palestinian resident of Jenin, Mujahed Azmi, on a military jeep that passed between two ambulances.The Israeli military in a statement said Israeli forces were fired at and exchanged fire, wounding a suspect and apprehending him.Soldiers then violated military protocol, the statement said. The military said the ""conduct of the forces in the video of the incident does not conform to the values"" of the Israeli military and the incident will be investigated and dealt with. The military said the man was transferred to medics for treatment.""I saw the statement they put out that the actions were inconsistent with the orders those soldiers received and that is being investigated and the people involved will be dealt with accordingly.

The bridge connecting North Sioux City, South Dakota , with Sioux City, Iowa, collapsed into the Big Sioux River late Sunday, an emergency manager said. Local media images showed a large span of the steel bridge partially underwater as floodwaters rushed over it.South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said at a news briefing Monday that the bridge was the main rail link from her state into Iowa. Some of its trusses collapsed, Jason Westcott, an emergency manager in Union County, South Dakota, told KCAU-TV.There were no reports of injuries from the collapse, which occurred around 11pm. The bridge's owner, BNSF Railway, had stopped operating it as a precaution during the flooding, spokesperson Kendall Sloan said. Trains are being rerouted.""We have damaged roads. We have damaged bridges,"" Noem said. ""That will impact us for many, many months to come.""The South Dakota Department of Transportation built a berm Sunday night across Interstate 29 in North Sioux City, temporarily blocking it.Floodwaters have risen over days of heavy rain where South Dakota, Iowa and Nebraska meet around Sioux City, as well as along the Iowa-Minnesota border.

Rescuers broke a window in a stairwell on the second floor, and almost 70 people crawled out, volunteers ferrying them away by boat in fours and fives.Engelkes and his girlfriend left with a bag of clothes, three cats in a carrier, and a kitten his girlfriend carried in her shirt. They expect their apartment to be ruined by about 4 feet of water but hope to still reclaim electronics they placed higher.

The candidates' microphones will remain muted unless it's their time to speak There will be no live studio audience to react to the debate -- in a stark departure from the tradition. This is to ensure that the candidates may maximize the time allotted in the debate. Candidates will have two minutes to answer questions. Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion. The 90-minute debate will include two commercial breaks. Campaign staff may not interact with their candidate during that time. Both Biden and Trump will appear at a uniform platform. Their podium positions has been determined by a coin flip. The coin landed on the Biden side giving him two options : either choose podium position or the order of the closing statements. Biden's side chose to select the right podium position. He will be on the right side of the viewers' screen. Trump's campaign chose the order of closing statements that he will speak last. Biden will give his concluding statement first. No props or pre-written notes will be allowed on the stage. Candidates will be given a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water.

The first face-off between incumbent president Joe Biden and his predecessor Donald Trump will be hosted by CNN's Jake Tapper and Dana Bash in Atlanta on June 27. This will be their first confrontation in the last four years as they faced each other twice in 2020.

Turk emphasized that the Rohingya have ""no options"" and ""nowhere to flee.""The Rohingya, a Muslim minority, have endured decades of persecution in Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist nation. Following a military-led crackdown in Rakhine state in 2017, nearly a million Rohingya sought refuge in camps located in Bangladesh's border district of Cox's Bazar.The Arakan Army's attack on Maungdaw is the latest development in a months-long rebellion against the Myanmar junta, which seized power in a coup in February 2021 and is now facing increasing challenges to its authority across significant parts of the country.According to Aung Kyaw Moe, the deputy human rights minister in the shadow National Unity Government, approximately 70,000 Rohingya in Maungdaw are currently trapped as the conflict intensifies. A resident of Maungdaw, who wished to remain anonymous for safety reasons, stated, ""We have nowhere to go, no safe zone, not enough food and basic necessities."" The resident further added, ""If they force us to leave, we will have no place to migrate."" An Arakan Army spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the situation.","The Rohingya, a Muslim minority, have endured decades of persecution in Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist nation.

She compared Afghan girls to ""birds with broken wings,"" still trying to fly and find opportunities despite their circumstances. Since regaining power in 2021, the Taliban government has severely restricted women's rights, banning them from secondary schools, universities, and certain public spaces, and prohibiting them from engaging in specific types of work.The UN has described the situation in Afghanistan as "" gender-based apartheid ,"" while the Taliban authorities claim their laws follow Islam and guarantee all citizens' rights under sharia. However, Richard Bennett, the special rapporteur on the rights situation in Afghanistan, told the council that the violations against women and girls are so severe that they may constitute crimes against humanity.Laila shared her personal experiences, mentioning that she knew several women who had taken their own lives after being captured and beaten by men using the ""excuse"" of improper hijab. She expressed her constant fear of being captured by security forces and the uncertainty of her fate. Laila also spoke about her lost opportunities and the impact on her mental health, stating, ""I face depression and I feel helpless.""Despite the challenges, Laila emphasized her determination to have a bright future and become a leader and voice for all Afghan girls. She appealed to the international community to continue supporting the girls and women of Afghanistan, particularly in education and work.Shafiqa Khpalwak, an Afghan poet, writer, and rights activist living in exile, also addressed the council, highlighting the Taliban's disregard for women and urging the international community to stand with them and be on the right side of history.","The girl, identified as Laila, spoke about the stark contrast between life before and after the Taliban's return to power nearly three years ago.
