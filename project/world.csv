BATHINDA: A nine-hour shutdown called by farmers' unions fighting for a legally guaranteed minimum support price mechanism for crops struck Punjab off the transport map Monday, with buses going off the road and 150-odd trains passing through or originating in the state either cancelled or curtailed.Thousands of stranded passengers spent the day at railway stations without functioning food stalls, while those who picked alternative transport ran into roadblocks at various places.SKM (non-political) and KMM had called for a shutdown of rail and road traffic from 7am to 4pm, barring even supply of milk and vegetables. Emergency services were exempted.Altercations between protesters and travellers inconvenienced by the strike were reported at some locations. A cancer patient from Gujarat and his wife were stranded at Ferozepur railway station en route Dharamshala in Himachal. The man's wife said she didn't find an eatery or a stall open to buy food, let alone give her husband the diet he has been medically advised to follow.In Faridkot, protesters allegedly abused and threatened primary block education officer Jagtar Singh for keeping his office open.Farm activist Sarvan Singh Pandher said organisations enforcing the strike had sought public support and people of the state spontaneously responded to it, making the bandh ""complete and peaceful"".Fellow activists Kaka Singh Kotda and Surjit Singh Phool said senior members of the farm lobby stayed put at Khanauri border protest site on Punjab-Haryana border as they were worried about safety of fasting farmer Jagjit Singh Dallewal.Punjab administration made another futile attempt at convincing the farmer to receive medical assistance ahead of Tuesday's scheduled hearing on the matter.Retired additional DGP Jaskaran Singh, accompanied by DIG (Patiala range) Mandeep Singh Sidhu and Patiala SSP Nanak Singh, held a series of meetings with farm activists at Khanauri since Sunday. Jaskaran Singh also met Dallewal. The latter only agreed to give blood samples for testing.In a short video after the strike ended, Dallewal thanked people of Punjab for backing the bandh. He also expressed gratitude to the volunteers by his side.Amid calls for unity till farm unions' demands are accepted, rival factions announced parallel kisan mahapanchayats on Jan 4 at two venues 27km apart. The events underscore the rift that some farm activists fear has weakened the movement that gained nationwide traction in 2020-21.SKM plans to hold its mahapanchayat at Tohana in Haryana, while the other two groups, SKM (non-Political) and KMM, will gather at Khanauri. Dallewal is expected to address the second event.",Farmers' unions called for nine-hour shutdown of rail and road traffic from 7am to 4pm. 150-odd trains passing through or originating in the state either cancelled or curtailed.

He claimed, ""Thousands of crores have exchanged hands for posts to be filled through this exam.""

For two years, during every performance of our play, the audience has agreed when we asked them if the Star Theatre should be named after Binodini. Today's move is a triumph for our campaign.

California Governor Gavin Newsom has ignited a firestorm on social media by endorsing President-elect Donald Trump ’s revised stance on H-1B visas , a move that aligns him with DOGE co-head Elon Musk . The unexpected endorsement has caused uproar among MAGA supporters , with some accusing Newsom of trying to sow discord within the Republican base.In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Newsom shared a screenshot of an article titled, “Trump supports immigration visas backed by Musk: ‘I have many H-1B visas on my properties.’” Accompanying the screenshot, the Democratic governor wrote, “Good to see Trump embrace Elon’s position. Hardworking immigrants should continue to be part of our great nation.”He elaborated, “From Silicon Valley to the Central Valley, we are better off when we have competition and top talent – from farmworkers, construction workers, CEOs, and beyond.”The reaction from MAGA supporters was swift and furious. Some claimed the movement was unraveling, with one commenter writing, “The most radical Democrats are now shilling for Trump. MAGA has been cooked for some time, but now it’s burnt to a crisp.”Others accused Newsom of exploiting the ongoing civil war within the MAGA ranks, urging supporters not to fall for his tactics. “This piece of [expletive] is just trying to stir up some [expletive]. Don’t fall for it,” one user cautioned.The controversy follows a broader debate within Trump’s inner circle, fueled by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy ’s advocacy for immigration visas. Musk recently liked a post suggesting Americans lack the skills for tech roles, while Ramaswamy called out “mediocrity” in American culture.Newsom doubled down on his pro-immigration stance, posting hours earlier, “@ElonMusk is right when he said: ‘you need to recruit top talent wherever they may be.’” He added, “The same principle should apply to supporting our farmworkers, construction, and trades workers who build and feed our country. Top talent is top talent.”As MAGA supporters debate their movement’s future, Newsom’s comments have exposed deep divisions, raising questions about Trump’s evolving positions and the ideological fault lines in American politics .","California Governor Gavin Newsom has ignited a firestorm on social media by endorsing President-elect Donald Trump’s revised stance on H-1B visas.

FBI issues warning to the sports leagues about burglaries of pro athletes' homes

The FBI has warned sports leagues that organized theft groups are targeting professional athletes, after a string of burglaries last month that targeted their homes while playing games or traveling. The houses of Kansas City Chiefs stars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow, Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Donić, and NBA guards Mike Conley Jr. and Bobby Portis have been among the burglarized properties, though the FBI does not note any of the above cases.The FBI has issued a warning to the sports leagues as a series of burglaries at the homes of professional athletes of the NFL and NBA has been reported, which contains high-end items such as designer handbags, jewelry, watches, and cash. The NFL and NBA have issued security alerts to their players following break-ins, some of which happened during road games. According to the NFL, homes of professional athletes are now increasingly targeted by organized groups for burglaries.“These homes are targeted for burglary due to the perception they may have high-end goods like designer handbags, jewelry, watches, and cash,” the FBI said in a Liaison Information Report obtained by ABC News. Between September and November 2024, at least nine professional athletes' homes were allegedly burglarized by organized theft groups.“While many burglaries occur while homes are unoccupied, some burglaries occur while residents are home. In these instances, individuals are encouraged to seek law enforcement help and avoid engaging with criminals, as they may be armed or use violence if confronted,” the report further stated.A string of burglars have hit the homes of Kansas City Chiefs stars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow, Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Donić, as well as NBA guards Mike Conley Jr. and Bobby Portis, though FBI reports don't note a single one of these thefts. According to the FBI, South American organized theft groups use public information and social media to carry out physical and technical surveillance, which often identifies potential victims' patterns of life and where valuables are stored in homes.“These preparation tactics enable theft groups to conduct burglaries in a short amount of time. Organized theft groups bypass alarm systems, use Wi-Fi jammers to block Wi-Fi connections and disable devices, cover security cameras, and obfuscate their identities,” the FBI report said.Also Read: Sauce Gardner clarified a social media statement that he will not recruit Tee Higgins to the Jets, which may have been misinterpreted by fans Recently, according to Lara Beth Seager, the business manager for the star guard, Dallas Mavericks player Luka Doncic was burglarized at his home.

The FBI recommends that athletes report suspicious activity, maintain valuable records, use additional security measures, and use caution when posting on social media; it also suggests that athletes avoid posting items of value, interior home shots, or real-time posts when on vacation.","FBI issues warning to the sports leagues about burglaries of pro athletes' homes.

And if I, with a decent attempt at an outfit apart from that, didn't meet that exception, I don't see what would, frankly,"" he added.""So I'm not even sure I broke any rules. But anyways, they decided to take that opportunity to pursue a very narrow interpretation of a rule. Apparently, there was no room for discussions or anything,"" Carlsen further said.""Anand said very clearly that he didn't know that he had any opportunity to do anything past, you know, go with the arbiters' honestly draconian decision of not pairing me.

RAJKOT: A man in his mid-forties faked his own death by allegedly murdering his friend and setting the body ablaze in Gondal town, reportedly driven by his desperate attempt to claim life insurance money to pay off a significant portion of his mounting debt.The investigation revealed that the man, Hasmukh Dhanja , who was believed to be charred to death on Dec 25 in Mota Mahika village, is alive, and the real victim was his friend Sandeep Goswami , 40. Goswami and Dhanja lived in Rajkot, and the latter owned a property in Mota Mahika village, some 35 km from the city.With the help of a minor boy, Dhanja allegedly killed Goswami and placed his footwear, purse, and mobile near the body to make people believe that he was the victim. His brother Hitesh, who was informed about the incident, found the half-charred body and called the police. Hitesh told the police that he found his brother's belongings and suspected that he was killed.On the other hand, Goswami's wife, Gayatri, told the police that her husband got a call from Hasmukh on Dec 25, and they were supposed to go to Mumbai for business purposes. Gayatri knew Hasmukh as both were friends, but she did not have much knowledge about their business.The same evening, Gayatri called her husband Sandeep Goswami, who told her that he, Hasmukh, and another person had come to Mota Mahika. Thereafter, Goswami's phone was switched off, but Gayatri believed that he left for Mumbai.K G Zala, deputy superintendent of police, Gondal, said, ""Investigators scanned the area after finding the body, but there was something suspicious. We got to know that three people came to the murder spot, of whom one died and another was out of reach. However, we located the third person, who was a minor boy, and he spilled the beans.""The minor revealed that they first strangled Goswami and killed him. Thereafter, they set the body on fire after sprinkling petrol. ""Hasmukh Dhanja committed the murder and set it ablaze so that it could not be identified. He kept his belongings near the body to concoct the story of his own death. We believe that he did this to get the insurance money, but the real reason will be known after Dhanja's arrest,"" Zala added.Gayatri came to know about her husband's death only after the police informed her. She runs a beauty parlour in a rented shop, and the couple has two daughters.The incident is a chilling reminder of a similar incident in Kutch where a woman had faked her suicide to start living with her lover in Oct.

Technocrats in Trump’s inner circle: A growing divide

The rift within the MAGA movement is growing, as influential right-wing activist Laura Loomer openly criticized tech magnate Elon Musk and other powerful technocrats for their increasing sway over President-elect Donald Trump’s transition. In a fiery appearance on Steve Bannon ’s War Room, Loomer expressed concerns about Musk’s connections to foreign officials and his rising political influence, raising alarm bells within Trump’s base.Loomer, a fierce nationalist known for her unapologetic rhetoric, accused Musk and his tech counterparts of prioritizing their personal interests over national security . “They’re nothing but welfare queens,” Loomer declared, blasting Musk and others for accepting government assistance while attempting to gain control over critical sectors like defense. Her remarks are part of a broader debate about Musk’s growing influence within Trump’s orbit—leading some critics to label him a ""shadow president.""The tension escalated when Loomer brought attention to Musk’s alleged interactions with foreign powers, particularly Iranian and Chinese officials. “What does it mean for our constitutional republic if technocrats with billions have unfettered access to our leaders while being cordial with adversaries like China and Iran?” Loomer questioned, casting a sharp spotlight on Musk’s off-the-record meetings with foreign officials.Her concerns mirror those raised by retired Lt. Gen. Russell Honoré, who labeled Musk a ""national security threat"" in an op-ed for The New York Times. Loomer’s remarks struck a nerve, as Mediaite reported, with Musk’s foreign dealings now under increased scrutiny, raising alarms across party lines.The ideological schism within the MAGA movement is becoming more pronounced, especially regarding Trump’s ties to technocrats like Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy . Loomer’s critique highlighted how Musk and Ramaswamy’s support for H-1B visa extensions conflicts with the nationalist ideals championed by many of Trump’s supporters. Loomer drew a sharp distinction between the interests of these elite tech figures and the grassroots MAGA base, which continues to push for stricter immigration controls and more American jobs.Bannon, a former Trump advisor and prominent voice in the right-wing media, has only intensified his criticism of Musk. Mediaite reports that Bannon has repeatedly questioned Musk’s deep involvement in Trump’s transition, accusing the billionaire of overstepping political boundaries and giving business elites undue influence over political decisions.With tensions running high, the battle within MAGA over the role of technocrats like Musk and Ramaswamy shows no signs of cooling. As the Trump transition moves forward, Loomer’s fiery rhetoric reflects a broader concern about the influence of Silicon Valley on the future of American politics—one that may further fracture an already divided movement.","Right-wing activist Laura Loomer openly criticized tech magnate Elon Musk and other powerful technocrats for their increasing sway over President-elect Donald Trump’s transition.

Trump team orders nominees to stay silent on social media after MAGA civil war over H-1B visas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-tweets-no-trouble-trump-team-orders-nominees-to-stay-silent-on-social-media-ahead-of-senate-hearings/articleshow/116813134.cms,"US President elect Donald Trump

A tightrope walk for nominees

The need for discipline

Silence from key nominees

A tight-lipped strategy for success

In an effort to maintain control and ensure smooth sailing through the Senate confirmation process , President-elect Donald Trump’s chief of staff, Susie Wiles, has issued a clear directive to his cabinet nominees: stop posting on social media. The message, sent out Sunday, came just days before the Senate hearings are set to begin, and reflects the mounting pressure Trump’s team faces as confirmation battles loom.Wiles, known for her no-nonsense approach and nicknamed the “Ice Maiden,” reiterated in a Dec. 29 memo that no member of the incoming administration or the transition team speaks for the president-elect or the United States. “All intended nominees should refrain from any public social media posts without prior approval of the incoming White House counsel,” she instructed, aiming to prevent any missteps or controversial statements from derailing the delicate process.Though Wiles acknowledged the enthusiasm of those joining the second Trump administration , her directive was firm. The move underscores the high stakes involved as Trump’s nominees prepare for what promises to be a contentious confirmation process, particularly with a GOP-controlled Senate that cannot afford to lose more than three votes from its own ranks if Democrats push back.Several of Trump’s picks have already encountered waves of criticism in recent weeks, with nominees like Pete Hegseth—Trump’s pick for Defense Secretary—facing intense scrutiny over allegations of misconduct. Despite this, he has managed to secure some key support, including from Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who recently praised his “encouraging conversations.”Still, Trump’s team has made it clear: any public social media engagement could spell trouble. The directive comes after the fallout from recent social media activity by figures like Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who stirred controversy with their outspoken comments on H-1B visas. However, Wiles emphasized that the ban wasn’t directly linked to this recent uproar but was a precautionary measure as the Senate confirmation process gears up.The memo appears to be having its desired effect. A review by The Post shows that most nominees, including some with the potential for tough questioning, have stayed silent on social media. This includes high-profile picks like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard, tapped for roles at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of National Intelligence, respectively. Both former Democrats have kept a low profile since Christmas, likely under the watchful eye of Trump’s team.Notably, Hegseth has been quiet on social media despite facing a storm of allegations, including accusations of promoting “anti-Christian bigotry” over his cross tattoos. The defense secretary designee had previously used his platform to push back against these criticisms, but with the confirmation process ahead, he has refrained from online battles.With the Senate confirmation hearings just around the corner, Trump’s nominees seem to be heeding the advice to stay silent, at least publicly. Behind closed doors, however, many have been working tirelessly to shore up support, including reaching out to senators across the aisle. The results of these efforts will likely shape the early days of Trump’s second term, and the stakes are high.As the battle for confirmation intensifies, the silence from Trump’s team speaks volumes. Whether this strategy of discipline will pay off remains to be seen, but for now, the focus is clear: keep quiet, stay focused, and prepare for the tough questions ahead.","President-elect Donald Trump’s chief of staff, Susie Wiles, has issued a clear directive to his cabinet nominees: stop posting on social media.

Russia rejects Trump's Nato deal for Ukraine peace,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russia-rejects-trumps-nato-deal-for-ukraine-peace-complete-non-starter/articleshow/116812681.cms,"Time

Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov delivered a scathing critique of a peace plan reportedly being floated by President-elect Donald Trump’s team to address the ongoing war in Ukraine. Lavrov dismissed the proposal, particularly its suggestion to delay Ukraine’s Nato membership, as fundamentally unacceptable to Moscow.Speaking at a news conference, Lavrov expressed outrage over the plan, which he claimed sought to suspend hostilities along the line of contact in Ukraine and transfer responsibility for the conflict to European forces, reported New York Post.“Judging from numerous leaks and Donald Trump’s interview withmagazine on December 12, their idea is to postpone Ukraine’s admission to Nato for 20 years and deploy British and European peacekeepers in Ukraine,” Lavrov said. “We are not happy with these proposals.”The criticism comes amid reports that Trump, who has vowed not to abandon Ukraine, is exploring strategies to broker peace while balancing European involvement. Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s pick as special envoy to Ukraine, has suggested leveraging military aid and weapons as bargaining tools to force negotiations.Lavrov, however, warned that such a plan was a “complete non-starter” for Russia. He reiterated Moscow’s long-standing opposition to Ukraine joining Nato under any circumstances, citing the alliance’s “aggressive absorption” as the rationale behind Russia’s invasion in 2022.The foreign minister added that the onus was on Trump to initiate talks with Moscow. “Even if he tries to relaunch bilateral ties, he will have to swim against the stream,” Lavrov remarked.A report from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank, underscored Lavrov’s comments as indicative of Russia’s rigid stance. According to the ISW, President Vladimir Putin’s demands include Ukraine’s permanent neutrality, a downsized military, and regime change in Kyiv.As Trump prepares to take office, navigating Moscow’s hardline position presents a daunting challenge to his promise of ending the war. With Lavrov’s stark rejection, the question remains whether Trump’s team can craft a deal that satisfies all parties—or if the conflict will persist in its current deadlock.","Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov delivered a scathing critique of a peace plan reportedly being floated by President-elect Donald Trump's team.

Teamsters’ unprecedented move

Trump’s post-election jab

Former President Donald Trump has reignited his criticism of Vice President Kamala Harris , sharing a New York Post article ontoday. The article details Harris’ contentious clash with Teamsters President Sean O’Brien during her campaign, despite Trump already securing victory in the 2024 election .According to the article, Harris stormed out of a meeting with O’Brien, dismissing the powerful union leader’s support by declaring, “I’m going to win with you or without you.” This statement, made before her electoral defeat, has drawn fresh scrutiny after Trump amplified the story.O’Brien, in an appearance on, recounted the episode and criticized Harris for cutting the meeting short and answering only four of the Teamsters’ 16 questions. Carlson remarked, “Damn. I thought I was arrogant. That’s really arrogant.”The fallout with Harris led to the Teamsters breaking a 30-year tradition of endorsing a presidential candidate. Their decision followed concerns about Biden’s decline and frustration with Harris’ approach. O’Brien revealed that 59.6% of the union’s 1.3 million members ultimately supported Trump, compared to Harris’ 34%.Even after his 2024 win, Trump’s repost of the article signals his continued focus on undermining Harris’ credibility. By revisiting her controversial encounter with the Teamsters, Trump appears to highlight what he views as a key misstep in her campaign.Harris, who had secured the Teamsters’ endorsement alongside Biden in 2020, now faces ongoing criticism as Trump leverages her strained relationship with the influential union to bolster his narrative of Democratic disarray.","Former President Donald Trump has reignited his criticism of Vice President Kamala Harris.

A Georgia governor with a background in engineering, Carter entered the 1976 presidential race as a relative outsider. His promise of honesty, encapsulated in the pledge, “If I ever lie to you, if I ever make a misleading statement, don’t vote for me,” struck a chord with a nation recovering from the Watergate scandal and the Vietnam War.Carter’s campaign, funded publicly and centred on transparency, helped him narrowly defeat incumbent Gerald Ford.

Speaker election on January 3



Donald Trump's mixed signals on Mike Johnson



President-elect Donald Trump Monday endorsed Mike Johnson ahead of the Speaker election heaping praises on him. Calling Mike Johnson a good, hard-working and religious man, Donald Trump said he will do the right thing. ""Mike has my complete and total endorsement,"" Donald Trump said. ""We are the Party of COMMON SENSE, a primary reason that we WON, in a landslide, the magnificent and historic Presidential Election of 2024. ALL SEVEN SWING STATES, 312 ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES, AND THE POPULAR VOTE BY MILLIONS OF VOTERS (Despite large scale voter fraud taking place in numerous states, including California, where votes are ridiculously still being counted, or under review!), ALL WON WITH EASE, CALM, & PROFESSIONALISM. Republicans are being praised for having run a “legendary” campaign!"" Donald Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.The profuse endorsement came as the MAGA got miffed over Mike Johnson's spending bill that Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy rejected and Republicans gave a call for a DOGE Speaker.""Democrats are being excoriated for their effort, having wasted 2.5 Billion Dollars, much of it unaccounted for, with some being used to illegally buy endorsements ($11,000,000 to Beyoncé, who never even sang a song, $2,000,000 to Oprah for doing next to nothing, and even $500,000 to Reverend AL, a professional con man and instigator, who agreed to “interview” their “star spangled” candidates, Kamala and Joe). We ran a flawless campaign, having spent FAR LESS, with lots of money left over. They ran a very expensive “sinking ship,” embracing DOJ & FBI WEAPONIZATION against their political opponent, ME. BUT IT DIDN’T WORK, IT WAS A DISASTER!!! LETS NOT BLOW THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY WHICH WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN. The American people need IMMEDIATE relief from all of the destructive policies of the last Administration. Speaker Mike Johnson is a good, hard working, religious man. He will do the right thing, and we will continue to WIN. Mike has my Complete & Total Endorsement. MAGA!!!"" Trump said.Mike Johnson (R-La) is set to come in with a 219-215 majority when the House meets to elect a speaker on Jan. 3, giving him a likely buffer of just one vote. So far only one House Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), has said straightforwardly that he plans to vote for an alternative to Johnson. Democrats have signaled that they won't rescue Johnson and plan to stay firmly behind House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.).Donald Trump recently criticised former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy for agreeing to raise the debt ceiling during the Biden administration calling it ""one of the dumbest political decisions made in years"". Donald Trump did not like that Johnson did not suspend the debt ceiling but now he threw his weight behind the speaker who helmed the passage of an alternative spending bill that averted the government shutdown on December 20.","President-elect Donald Trump Monday endorsed Mike Johnson ahead of the Speaker election heaping praises on him.

Parents question

suicide ruling

The whistleblower's legacy

Community demands answers

A family's grief

The mysterious death of Suchir Balaji , a former OpenAI researcher and whistleblower, has left his family demanding answers. Balaji, 26, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on November 26, with the medical examiner ruling it a suicide. However, his parents, Balagi Ramamurthy and Ramarao, vehemently dispute the findings, alleging foul play and demanding an FBI investigation .""I was the last person to talk to him,"" said Ramamurthy. ""He was happy, not depressed or anything. It was his birthday week. How can anyone believe there was no note left?""Balaji’s mother added, ""There were signs of a fight in the bathroom. Blood shots. This cannot be ignored.""The tragedy occurred three months after Balaji publicly accused OpenAI of copyright violations in the development of ChatGPT, a move his parents believe may have put him at risk.The San Francisco Police Department stated that no evidence of foul play was found during their initial investigation. A gun was discovered near Balaji’s body, and the absence of others at the scene contributed to the suicide ruling. Yet, his parents argue that the investigation was rushed.“It took the medical examiner 40 seconds to declare it a suicide,” Ramarao alleged, as reported by The Gaurdian.Balaji had no history of mental illness , and his parents insist he had plans to visit them in January. ""This is not the behavior of someone considering ending their life,"" said Ramamurthy.Balaji, a computer science prodigy from UC Berkeley, began his career at OpenAI in 2020, working on projects that laid the groundwork for ChatGPT. He quit in August, citing ethical concerns about copyright violations.“If you believe what I believe, you have to just leave the company,” he said in an October interview with The New York Times.OpenAI expressed its condolences, stating it was ""devastated"" by the news and offered support to Balaji’s family.At a candlelight vigil attended by 80 people, supporters called for a deeper investigation. Ganesh Balamitran, a Fremont resident, praised Balaji’s advocacy for creators’ rights. ""He was fighting for every creative artist out there,"" he said.Aruja Gupta, a San Jose State University student, echoed the demand for justice: ""The police need to put more resources into this case.""Balaji’s parents shared memories of their son’s brilliance and ethical upbringing. “He was a prodigy,” Ramarao said. “The ethics with which I raised him took his life today.”The case remains under active investigation, but for Balaji’s parents, only a federal probe can uncover the truth. ""Our son deserves justice,"" they said.","Suchir Balaji, 26, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on November 26. The medical examiner ruled it a suicide.

The adjustment did not go unnoticed, as followers highlighted the error and questioned the governor’s team.“Did anyone in the Governor’s Office proof the condolence note?” asked a Democratic group in Texas. Another user wrote, “You sent condolences to Rosalynn? What world are you living in?”Rosalynn Carter passed away on November 19, 2023, shortly after entering hospice care. Her husband, former President Jimmy Carter, had been in hospice since February 2023 and passed away at the age of 100.In addition to the condolence mistake, Abbott ordered Texas flags to fly at half-mast until January 29, following President Joe Biden’s federal order to honour Carter’s passing.Abbott’s mistake adds to a series of similar gaffes. According to the Daily Beast, in 2023, he shared a satirical article claiming country singer Garth Brooks was booed off stage for advocating tolerance, captioning it, “Go Woke. Go Broke.” The post was quickly deleted after the article’s author, Christopher Blair, pointed out the mistake, calling Abbott “one of the dumbest people in the country.”","Texas governor Greg Abbott mistakenly included condolence for former first lady Rosalynn Carter, who passed away last year, in his statement mourning the death of former US President Jimmy Carter.

The incident, which he recounted both before and during his presidency, continues to draw interest.In a 2005 interview with GQ magazine , Carter recalled the incident, which occurred in southwest Georgia while he was preparing to speak at a Lions Club meeting.Carter recorded his observations on a tape recorder and later documented them.“There were about 25 of us standing around when someone pointed to a bright light in the sky,” he was quoted as saying by the New York Post . The light grew closer, stopped beyond nearby pine trees, and shifted colours from blue to red and back to white.“It was a flying object that was unidentified,” he said. “But I’ve never believed it came from Mars. I know enough physics to know that vehicles can’t fly from Mars, look around, and then return,"" he added.Despite his own sighting, Carter dismissed conspiracy theories about alien landings, including the infamous Roswell, New Mexico, incident in 1947. “I don’t believe in a cover-up of extraterrestrial visits,” he said.During his presidency, Carter encountered an extraordinary CIA operation involving a psychic. While investigating Roswell, he learned the agency had consulted a Californian woman claiming supernatural abilities to locate a lost plane in the Central African Republic. “She gave coordinates while in a trance, and when we sent a satellite to that location, the plane was there,” Carter revealed.Many US presidents, from Harry STruman to Donald Trump, have spoken about UFOs and alien theories. Carter’s successor, Ronald Reagan, also claimed to have seen a UFO in 1974 while flying a Cessna over Bakersfield, California.","Former US President Jimmy Carter claimed to have seen a UFO in 1969.

Law enforcement responded to a report involving two hunters on a small, private property where both men were hunting deer.According to LDWF, the two hunters, who had permission to hunt on the land, were unaware that they were on the same property. One hunter mistakenly identified the other as a deer and fired his 20-gauge shotgun, hitting the man with buckshot.The shooter immediately called 911 upon realising his mistake. The wounded man was airlifted to Our Lady of the Lake Hospital in Baton Rouge with non-fatal injuries. Authorities did not specify the location of his injuries.Upon investigating the incident, law enforcement discovered that neither hunter was wearing the required orange clothing nor had deer tags with them, leading to the shooter being cited for both violations.The LDWF said that additional charges may follow as the investigation continues. In the meantime, the agency has issued a reminder to all hunters to prioritise safety. ""Always wear orange, which is required by law, and positively identify your target and surroundings before firing your weapon,"" LDWF was quoted as saying to Fox news.The department concluded, ""Let’s work together to prevent incidents like this and ensure everyone enjoys the outdoors safely.""","The shooting occurred on December 23 in Zachary, a city located in East Baton Rouge Parish.

She pointed to Biden’s mental state, which, according to her, should have been reported more before it became widely apparent during the summer debate.""Undercovered and underreported, that would be, to me, Joe Biden’s obvious cognitive decline that became undeniable in the televised debate,"" Crawford said on the show.She also referred to a Wall Street Journal report that revealed how White House aides allegedly concealed Biden’s struggles. The report claims that his staff had formed a protective circle around the 82-year-old president, limiting his interactions with the public.“And yet he insisted that he could still run for president. We should have much more forcefully questioned whether he was fit for office for another four years, which could have led to a primary for the Democrats,” Crawford said. “It could have changed the scope of the entire election.”As Biden's first term continued, more people questioned his mental fitness. News outlets, including The Post, highlighted his frequent mistakes and mishaps. His struggles peaked during the June 27 debate, raising more concerns about his ability to lead. In July, Biden dropped out of the race and was replaced by vice president Kamala Harris , who lost to Trump in the December election.Despite the backlash, Crawford expressed disbelief at claims by Biden’s advisers that he regretted withdrawing from the race and believed he could have beaten Trump. “Yet still, incredibly, we read in The Washington Post that his advisers are saying that he regrets that he dropped out of the race, that he thinks he could have beaten Trump,” Crawford said. “And I think that is either delusional or they’re gaslighting the American people.”CBS News' Robert Costa added that Biden and many of his top aides continue to insist he was simply unwell during the debate and has always been ""fine.""",CBS News reporter Jan Crawford said the most 'underreported' story of 2024 was Joe Biden's 'obvious cognitive decline' Crawford also referred to a Wall Street Journal report that revealed how White House aides allegedly concealed Biden's struggles.

However, after receiving clarification from state representative Jared Patterson, who authored the law, the Bible has now been returned to the shelves.In a leaked email to the public, Canyon ISD Superintendent Dr Darryl Flusche explained that the full text of the Bible would no longer be available in schools due to these new regulations. He added that some books containing Bible stories or portions of the Bible would remain accessible, and students could request a Bible through donations from local churches.The district’s decision sparked strong reactions from parents. At a school board meeting in December, one parent called the removal of the Bible “absurd,” while another, Regina Kiehne, a parent with children in the district, argued that the Bible should be valued for its wisdom and importance. ""The Bible holds great value. It should be valued in our Texas school system,"" Kiehne was quoted as saying to the Daily Mail.State senator Kevin Sparks also criticised the move, saying that the Bible is not “sexually explicit” and should not have been removed. “At a time when students seek guidance, the Bible provides a vital moral framework,” he said on social media.Amid the public outcry, Canyon ISD conducted a review of the new law and sought further clarification from Patterson. He reassured the district that the Bible should not be removed under the new guidelines.Following this clarification, the district decided to return the Bible to its libraries, confirming that the decision was made after a thorough review of the law to ensure a ""legally compliant educational environment.""“We are pleased to have the Bible available in each of our Canyon ISD libraries,” the district said in a statement.","Canyon Independent School District initially pulled the Bible from its libraries to comply with House Bill 900, a new state law banning books with ""sexually explicit"" material.

She added that Khan also said that ""he has faced jail and is not making any deals when his cases are ending"".The statement comes when a Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) team is holding talks with the government to address various political issues.Aleema said that the negotiating team would make two demands, including the release of all political prisoners and formation of a commission to probe the violence on May 9, 2023 and November 26 this year.The next round of talks between the two sides is scheduled to take place on January 2 at 11 am at the office of National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq who is facilitating the two sides.In a related development, US President-elect Donald Trump's designated advisor Richard Grenell last week reiterated his demand for the release of Khan, saying, ""I would like Imran Khan to be released from jail. He has the same charges as Donald Trump. The ruling political party in Pakistan has put him in jail on false charges of corruption.""Commenting on Grenell's statement, Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said, ""I cannot comment on the statements of any one person.

cross-border militancy

Diplomatic efforts amid rising hostilities

What lies ahead?

Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border, leaving at least eight individuals dead and 13 others, including civilians, injured on the Afghan side. The ongoing conflict, which persisted into late Saturday night, comes amidst the growing strain between the two nations, once considered allies.The violence followed an intense exchange of fire, reportedly triggered by Pakistan's targeted airstrikes on alleged camps of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan's eastern Paktika province earlier in the week. Pakistani security officials claim the strikes were a response to a failed infiltration attempt by militants from Afghanistan.According to Pakistani sources, militants attempting to breach the border on Friday night were repelled by Pakistani forces. The following morning, these militants allegedly joined Afghan forces to launch coordinated attacks on Pakistani border posts using light and heavy weapons. The attacks targeted several areas, including Ghozgarhi, Matha Sangar, Kot Ragha, and Tari Mengal.Pakistani forces retaliated, reportedly inflicting significant losses and forcing the attackers to abandon their posts. However, the violence also claimed the life of one Frontier Corps soldier and left 11 others injured.Pakistan has long accused the Afghan Taliban of harboring TTP militants who have intensified attacks on Pakistani security forces in recent months. These attacks, particularly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan regions, have heightened security concerns in Islamabad.While urging the Afghan government to take decisive action against the TTP, Pakistan said that dialogue between the two nations could not occur amidst ongoing violence.While these diplomatic calls were failing, tensions flared after Pakistan's airstrikes in the Barmal district of Paktika on December 24, which reportedly killed at least 46 individuals, including women and children. The Taliban's ministry of defense condemned the strikes, describing them as an attack on civilians and vowing retaliation.The airstrikes came on the same day a Pakistani delegation led by Special Representative Muhammad Sadiq met Afghan leaders in Kabul in an attempt to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long hiatus. However, the Afghan government lodged a formal protest over the airstrikes, accusing Pakistan of targeting civilians rather than militants.The escalating conflict comes against the backdrop of strained relations following the TTP's termination of a ceasefire with Pakistan in November 2022. Since then, attacks by the TTP have claimed the lives of numerous Pakistani soldiers, further deteriorating ties between the neighbors.The renewed border violence, marked by both airstrikes and ground clashes, shows a growing distrust between Kabul and Islamabad. While Pakistan continues to demand action against the TTP, the Afghan Taliban denies harboring militants and accuses Pakistan of targeting civilians under the guise of counterterrorism operations.","Tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have escalated into deadly clashes at the border.

The boy, identified as Balach, son of Sabrullah, is from the Panjgur district, and his family members claimed that he was forcibly taken from his home ten days ago during a raid by Pakistani forces.According to The Balochistan Post, Balach was reportedly subjected to physical abuse before being taken away while still injured. Authorities have yet to comment on the incident, which has sparked concern among local and international human rights organisations.The Pakistani military's repeated targeting of the family has been documented, with previous incidents including a raid on their residence where property was damaged and two hand grenades were thrown outside, though no injuries were reported.According to local sources, the forces have conducted regular raids on the house, subjecting the family to continuous intimidation, as per the report.In another incident, Pakistani forces detained a man identified as Fazal Bashir in the coastal city of Gwadar. Fazal, a resident of Hirabad area in Kech district, was detained on December 23, and his location remains unidentified, according to The Balochistan Post.His family has sought assistance from human rights organisations to determine his whereabouts, worried about his safety. The persistent issue of enforced disappearances in Balochistan continues to draw attention, with local activists and human rights organisations demanding accountability and the release of missing persons.Despite continuous calls for justice, these incidents highlight the ongoing accusations against Pakistani security forces in the region.The families of Balach and Fazal have requested authorities to investigate their cases and provide information about their missing relatives.Balochistan continues to witness systematic abductions and killings, affecting various segments of society including activists, politicians, journalists and civilians, who are reportedly taken by security forces, according to news agency ANI.The Pakistani military faces frequent accusations of using enforced disappearances as a tactic against insurgents and separatist groups.

International outcry

Pakistan's response

Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots that targeted military sites and other facilities following the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan This brings the total number of convictions related to the unrest to 85, according to announcements from the military’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).Among those sentenced is Hassan Niazi , Khan’s nephew, who received a 10-year prison term for his alleged role in the attack on the Lahore Corps Commander’s residence, also known as Jinnah House.The ISPR stated that the Field General Court Martial handed down the sentences after reviewing evidence and ensuring due process. “Sequel to the announcement of the May 9 punishments... the Field General Court Martial has promulgated the punishments to the following remaining 60 culprits after examining all evidence, ensuring the provision of all legal rights to the convicts, completion of due process, and the appropriate legal proceedings,” the ISPR announced.The convicted individuals face sentences ranging from two to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment. They have the right to appeal the decisions under Pakistan's Constitution.The unrest on May 9 erupted after Imran Khan’s arrest in a corruption case. Supporters of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party allegedly attacked key military installations, including the Army General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, the Corps Commander’s House in Lahore, and an ISI office in Faisalabad.In response, authorities detained hundreds of individuals, and 103 were handed over to military courts for trial, sparking widespread criticism of the opaque judicial process.The convictions have drawn sharp rebukes from international entities, including the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union. Critics argue that the use of military courts to try civilians undermines judicial independence and transparency.“These military courts lack judicial independence, transparency, and due process guarantees,” the US State Department said. Similarly, the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCO) criticized the lack of transparency and independent oversight in the trials, emphasizing the importance of adhering to fair trial standards under international law.The European Union also expressed concern, highlighting that Pakistan’s actions contradict its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and commitments tied to the GSP+ trade program.The Pakistani government has defended the use of military courts, citing the Supreme Court’s decision that allowed the military to proceed with trials of civilians involved in the riots. The Foreign Office reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to international human rights obligations, asserting that the trials were conducted in accordance with national laws.The ISPR emphasized that the convictions reflect the military’s resolve to uphold justice and maintain the authority of the state, stating, “The Nation, Government, and Armed Forces remain steadfast in their commitment to upholding justice and ensuring that the inviolable writ of the state is maintained.”","Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots.

Pakistan Airstrikes Afghanistan: Kabul claims Pak airstrikes killed 46 civilians in Afghanistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/kabul-claims-pak-airstrikes-killed-46-civilians-in-afghanistan/articleshow/116661701.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The interim Afghan Taliban govt claimed on Wednesday that 46 people, mostly women and children, were killed in airstrikes by Pakistani fighter jets on civilians in eastern Afghanistan late Tuesday night.Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province near Pakistan’s volatile South Waziristan tribal district, on alleged camps of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). This has been the fourth time in the past few years that Pakistan has conducted airstrikes inside Afghanistan, and the second time since March 2024.“Last night (Tuesday), Pakistan bombarded four points in Barmal district of Paktika province. The total number of dead is 46, most of whom were children and women,” said Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesperson for the Afghan Taliban govt. He added that six others, mostly children, were wounded.Condemning the airstrikes, the Afghan defence ministry called them “barbaric” and a clear “aggression”. It stated that several refugees, including women and children, were killed and injured. “The Pakistani side should understand that such arbitrary measures are not a solution to any problem,” Enayatullah Khowarazami, spokesperson for Afghanistan’s defence ministry, wrote on social media platform ‘X’. “The Islamic Emirate (Afghan Taliban regime) will not leave this cowardly act unanswered, but rather considers the defence of its territory and sovereignty to be its inalienable right,” he added.The strikes took place hours after Pakistan special representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq met interim Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul, intending to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long gap. The deteriorating ties, however, are likely to worsen following Tuesday night’s airstrikes, analysts said.Pakistan alleges the Afghan government harbours armed groups, particularly the TTP, which conducts cross-border assaults against Pakistani security forces. In one of the worst recent assaults on security forces, the TTP had claimed responsibility for the killing of at least 16 Pakistani soldiers in South Waziristan last week.Kabul, however, denies providing shelter to armed groups or allowing their territory to be used for cross-border attacks.Border tensions between the two countries have surged since the Taliban regime took control in 2021, with Pakistan experiencing a revival of militant activity along its western border. Deadly air attacks by Pakistan’s military in Afghan border regions in March, which the Taliban claimed killed eight civilians, had sparked confrontations along the the disputed border between the two countries.","Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province.

ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani minister on Wednesday defended the military trial of civilians, saying that such courts were competent to deal with the cases related to attacks on army facilities.Information minister Attaullah Tarar also urged the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) led by Imran Khan to refrain from politicising or disputing the issue of military trials.""When an attack is carried out on a defence institution or its property is set ablaze, it becomes the responsibility of the relevant authorities to apprehend the culprits. Just as railway police handle crimes on railway premises, military courts address offences targeting military assets. So, when attacks on military assets occur, the Military Act is enforced,"" he said while addressing a press conference.Tarar criticised Khan's party for using military courts as a political tool, aiming to create controversy around them. He clarified that military courts only handle cases involving attacks on defence establishments, citing incidents such as the attack on the Corps Commander's House in Lahore.The minister also criticised the PTI for changing its stance regarding trials of civilians in the military courts, recalling that during Khan's tenure, military court trials were praised.""The statements praising the military courts from PTI's leadership are still available on social media. Yet now, the same individuals are lobbying internationally against these courts,"" Tarar said.He assured that military trials adhere to fair trial principles and dismissed claims of injustice in military trials.The military courts tasked to hear cases of suspects involved in the attacks on military facilities on the May 9, 2023 protest last week sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from 2-10 years.Khan's party criticized the verdicts, arguing that military courts have no jurisdiction over civilians.",Information minister Attaullah Tarar says military courts are competent to deal with cases related to attacks on army facilities.
