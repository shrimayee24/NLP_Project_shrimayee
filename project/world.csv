"3 cops die in Kathua encounter, three terrorists shot dead",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kathua-encounter-3-policemen-3-terrorists-killed-in-gun-battle/articleshow/119612538.cms,"JAMMU: Three J&K policemen and an equal number of suspected Pakistani terrorists were killed Thursday in a gunfight that erupted when security forces searching the forested Sufain area in Kathua district of Jammu division came under fire from gunmen hiding in the woods.DSP Dheeraj Katoch, two other policemen, and an Army soldier from 1 PARA (Special Forces) were wounded. The area has been cordoned off and reinforcements deployed.According to official sources, the slain policemen includes a head constable and two constables. The bodies were yet to be evacuated from the site as the operation continues.Grenades and rocket fire rocked the area with multiple explosions. “The gunfire continued throughout the day,” an official said late at night, adding that the wounded security personnel were taken to Kathua and Jammu hospitals, where they are reported to be in stable condition.The attackers are believed to be the same group that managed to escape after a brief gunfight Sunday evening near Sanyal village in Hiranagar sector, close to the Pakistan border. Sufain’s forests are about 35km from Sanyal village.The security forces had closed in on the terrorists hiding in a remote, mountain hut — one of many built by nomadic herders who roam the area with their livestock. But they slipped away, triggering a manhunt across the region.The search entered its fourth day, with the Army, NSG, BSF, CRPF, and J&K police deploying advanced surveillance tools, bulletproof vehicles, UAVs, drones, and sniffer dogs.On Monday, search teams found four loaded magazines of an M4 carbine, two grenades, a bulletproof jacket, sleeping bags, tracksuits, and materials for making IEDs. A breakthrough came the next day when a woman in Dinga Amb village reported seeing two men in combat clothing asking for water. This prompted an expansion of the search.Also read: 'Separatism breathing its last': Amit Shah hails 'new Bharat' as two more Hurriyat affiliates quit Security has been tightened along Jammu-Pathankot national highway and link roads leading to border villages to plug potential escape routes for the terrorists.In Rajouri district, security forces found a terrorist hideout in Manyal Gali forests of Thanamandi, seizing live rounds, a grenade, a gas cylinder, a solar panel, and food supplies.Terrorist activities sparked protests in Jammu, where Dogra Front and Shiv Sena activists burned a Pakistani flag, denouncing cross-border terrorism.","Three J&K policemen and an equal number of suspected Pakistani terrorists killed in gunfight.

Opposition stages walkout in Rajya Sabha

NEW DELHI: Samajwadi Party (SP) MP Ramji Lal Suman , who is currently facing backlash for his remarks on Rajput ruler Rana Sanga , refused to backdown on his comments saying, ""there is nothing to apologise for.""In an interview with PTI, Suman said that ""people should develop a habit of listening to the right things"" and firmly declared, ""I will not apologise in this life.""Suman's remarks, captured on video, described Rana Sanga as a ""traitor"" who invited Mughal emperor Babur to defeat Ibrahim Lodi.Defending his remarks, he said, ""It is a historical fact that Rana Sanga brought Babur to defeat Ibrahim Lodhi. They had an understanding that Babur would attack Ibrahim Lodhi, and Rana Sanga would attack Agra. Rana Sanga did not keep his part of the deal.""""Later, Babur and Rana Sanga fought against each other in Fatehpur Sikri, and Rana Sanga fought with great bravery but lost the battle. This is a fact,"" he added.The SP MP also cited historical sources, including ""Baburnama"" and Jawaharlal Nehru’s ""Discovery of India,"" to support his claim.""There is a big historian Puniyani, Baburnama, and as far as I remember, Jawaharlal Nehru has mentioned it in Discovery of India too... As I said, this is historic and I am ready to confirm it,"" he told PTI.The remarks led to a violent backlash. On Wednesday, a mob reportedly linked to Karni Sena vandalised Suman’s residence near Hari Parvat Chauraha, damaging parked cars and breaking glass windows. Videos showed a small number of police officers attempting to control the situation as the attackers rampaged. One policeman was injured during the violence.Suman alleged that the attack was a direct threat to his family. ""They broke all the glass windows, destroyed the cars in the colony, and their intent was to harm my family. I had already informed the Rajya Sabha Chairman about threats being made against me since March 22 through social media,"" he said, adding that the attackers even arrived with a bulldozer.Also read: 'Just a trailer,' says Karni Sena leader on vandalising Samajwadi MP's house over Rana Sanga remark Following the incident, Agra police registered an FIR against an ""unknown mob"" under charges including rioting, attempted murder, house trespass, and robbery, as per ANI.

""The attackers came with bulldozers, sticks, and swords, yet they were not stopped. This suggests they had government backing,"" Yadav alleged.The political fallout intensified, with SP, Congress, and other opposition parties staging a walkout in the Rajya Sabha to protest the attack.

Opposition leaders criticised the BJP government for failing to prevent the violence.SP chief Akhilesh Yadav accused Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath of complicity.

Outgunned Maoists recruiting even 9-year-olds as soldiers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/outgunned-maoists-recruiting-even-9-year-olds-as-soldiers/articleshow/119618729.cms,"RAIPUR: Crumbling under relentless pressure from security forces, Maoists in Bastar may be recruiting child soldiers as young as nine years old.A handwritten Maoist letter in Telugu found at a recent encounter site in a forest in Bijapur’s Abujhmarh claims that CPI (Maoist) has recruited 130 cadres from Marh region, 80 of them minors, including children aged nine. It says these raw recruits are undergoing training in “guerrilla warfare, weapon handling and IED-making”.It also paints a picture of an insurgent organisation in disarray, low on morale and fighters, and the gnawing realisation of being locked in a losing battle. Union home minister Amit Shah has vowed that Naxalism will be uprooted from the country by March 2026.Believed to be a “review report” of the outfit emerging from an internal meeting, it was found after a gunbattle in which Maoist commander Sudheer alias Sudhakar was shot dead on March 25, police said. Sudheer was responsible for training new recruits in weapons and guerrilla tactics.“Earlier, teenagers were recruited into Maoist cultural wing, called Chetna Natya Manch, and later given combat training. If the review report is to be believed, then it indicates a dangerous trend of Maoists recruiting children as ‘child soldiers’. We don’t want a soldiers-vs-children and will run campaigns to stop this recruitment,” a senior officer of Bastar range said.A young surrendered cadre in Bijapur told TOI that Maoists make it mandatory for villages to hand over a certain number of children and youngsters and threaten to evict families that don’t abide by the ‘rule’.The letter says Maoists held a gram sabha in Marh region and recruited 130 cadres — 50 in the ages 18-22, 40 aged 14-17 and, alarmingly, 40 aged between nine and 11 years.The report includes a detailed account of the current challenges faced by Maoist leadership, particularly the difficulty in recruiting new members. Maoist commanders expressed concern about the “growing reluctance” among young people to join their cause, and realise that future recruitment efforts might be even more challenging.Maoists are worried that a significant portion of the cadres have either surrendered or been killed in encounters, leaving them short of experienced fighters. Without new recruits, the very existence of Naxalism in the region is at risk, the letter says.Maoists have imposed stricter rules on new recruits — they are no longer allowed to visit their villages or families, fearing they may surrender or be arrested. If a recruit tries to leave, or is seen interacting with family or outsiders, this is to be immediately escalated to the committee commander, it says. Of 14 such cases, six were summoned for “counselling and review” by the leadership.","A handwritten Maoist letter in Telugu found at a recent encounter site in a forest in Bijapur’s Abujhmarh claims that CPI (Maoist) has recruited 130 cadres from Marh region.

US President Donald Trump says he may cut China tariffs to finalise TikTok deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-president-donald-trump-says-he-may-cut-china-tariffs-to-finalise-tiktok-deal/articleshow/119579238.cms,"Background on the TikTok case

US President Donald Trump stated on Wednesday (March 26) that he is open to reducing tariffs on China to facilitate a deal for TikTok’s Chinese parent, ByteDance, to sell the app. TikTok, used by 170 million Americans, faces a looming April 5 deadline for divestment or a potential US ban. Speaking to reporters, Trump acknowledged that China’s approval is necessary for any agreement to move forward. “Maybe I’ll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done,” he said, indicating that tariffs could be used as a bargaining tool to push the sale.According to a Reuters report, he also signaled a willingness to extend the April 5 deadline if a deal is not reached in time, reinforcing that resolving TikTok’s ownership remains a priority for his administration.Trump has previously used tariffs to pressure China in trade and technology disputes. On his first day in office, he warned that he could impose new tariffs if Beijing did not approve a US deal for TikTok. Since then, the Trump administration has added 20% in levies to all Chinese imports.As per the report, Trump acknowledged that China’s approval is crucial for any agreement and suggested that a tariff reduction could help finalise the deal.Concerns over TikTok’s Chinese ownership have been ongoing in Washington, with lawmakers fearing the app could be used for data collection and influence operations by the Chinese government. In 2024, Congress passed a law requiring ByteDance to sell TikTok’s US operations by January 19, citing national security risks. The app was briefly banned after the US Supreme Court upheld the law, but Trump later postponed enforcement to April 5 through an executive order.The White House has taken an active role in negotiations, with talks reportedly centering on non-Chinese investors increasing their stakes in ByteDance to take control of TikTok’s U.S. operations. Vice President JD Vance has said he expects a general agreement on the deal by April 5.","US President Donald Trump says he is open to reducing tariffs on China to facilitate a deal for TikTok’s Chinese parent, ByteDance, to sell the app. TikTok, used by 170 million Americans, faces a looming April 5 deadline for divestment or a potential US ban.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119579233,imgsize-33438,width-400,resizemode-4/119579233.jpg"

[Screengrab/X]

The midnight email that changed everything

ICE at the door

Columbia’s silence and a fellow student’s arrest

Branded a 'terrorist sympathizer'

Columbia’s betrayal and a dangerous precedent

An uncertain future

Ranjani Srinivasan , a 37-year-old Indian PhD candidate at Columbia University , never imagined her academic journey would end with a frantic escape to Canada. Pursued by immigration agents, labeled a "" terrorist sympathizer "" by a top US official, and abandoned, she says, by the institution she dedicated years to, Srinivasan now faces an uncertain future.In an interview with Al Jazeera, Srinivasan recounted the 10 harrowing days after her student visa was revoked—an ordeal that led to her fleeing the United States in fear of arrest following accusations from US homeland security secretary Kristi Noem.On March 6, Srinivasan woke up in her Columbia-owned apartment to an email from the US consulate in Chennai informing her that her visa had been canceled. Initially dismissing it as spam, she checked the official immigration portal and found confirmation that her visa, which was renewed months earlier until 2029, was no longer valid.Panicked, she contacted Columbia’s International Students and Scholars Office (ISSO). After hours of silence, the office assured her that her student status (I-20) was still intact and scheduled a Zoom meeting for the next day.Ten minutes into that Zoom call, there was a knock on her door.Al Jazeera reported, men claiming to be immigration agents, who without properly identifying themselves, demanded entry, saying they intended to place her in removal proceedings. Her roommate refused to open the door.“I freaked out. Why is ICE at my door?” Srinivasan recalled. “You live in Columbia housing, a place you’d consider safe. The fact that they entered without a warrant was terrifying.”The ISSO adviser on the call, visibly shocked, muted herself to make frantic calls before providing Srinivasan with a list of lawyers. She said Columbia’s Public Safety advised her not to open the door but offered little else.The next day, on March 8, the agents returned, warning they would keep coming ""every day"" until she was placed in removal proceedings. That same day, Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian Green Card holder and protest leader, was arrested from Columbia housing.“That’s when I realized I have no rights in this system,” Srinivasan said. “Columbia knew ICE was operating on campus but seemed uninterested in intervening.”By March 9, Columbia revoked her student status and ordered her to vacate university housing.Srinivasan knew her time in the US was running out and decided not to wait for deportation. With no legal recourse, she packed a single bag—leaving behind her furniture, belongings, and even her cat, Cricket—and fled to Canada on March 11 using a visitor visa she had previously secured for academic workshops and conferences.Three days later, homeland security secretary Kristi Noem posted a grainy airport photo of Srinivasan on X (formerly Twitter), labeling her a ""terrorist sympathizer"" and claiming she had ""self-deported"" using a border control app she had never heard of.“If supporting the idea of human rights or ending a genocide is equated with supporting Hamas, then anyone in proximity to me – without me having done anything – can just be picked up and made an example of,” Srinivasan said.While she had participated in pro-Palestine protests and shared social media posts critical of Israel’s war on Gaza, she insists she was never part of any organized campus group. The US government has yet to specify any charges against her.Columbia’s ISSO spokesperson, Kendall Easley, was quoted by Al Jazeera as saying that the university ""welcomes international students"" but did not address Srinivasan’s claims that the school failed to protect her.Her union, Student Workers of Columbia (UAW Local 2710), condemned the university’s inaction, saying: “Ranjani’s case exposes a dangerous precedent… International students feel disposable—at the mercy of the state, with no protection from Columbia.”Now in Canada, Srinivasan is unsure if she’ll ever return to the US, even if her visa is reinstated. Her parents in India, fearing backlash, temporarily fled their home after Noem’s tweet sparked media frenzy and misinformation.“I spent five years at Columbia, working 100-hour weeks,” she said. “I never expected the institution to let me down. But it did.”","Ranjani Srinivasan, a 37-year-old Indian PhD candidate at Columbia University, never imagined her academic journey would end with a frantic escape to Canada.

NAGPUR: An Islamist outfit member , Faizan Khatib , who was holed up in his Nagpur residence for 10 days after riots erupted, was arrested late Wednesday along with another suspect, Shahbaz Qazi , and sent to two-day police remand on Thursday. Police claim Khatib holds radical views and instigated mobs.Khatib, who had been operating from Akola, had moved to his hometown, Nagpur, a month ago for Eid. Police zeroed in on him while scouring March 17 CCTV footage at the riot epicentre, Mahal, 2km off the RSS headquarters.Khatib is being considered the third big catch after two other accused, Fahim Khan and his mentor, Hamid Engineer. A case of rioting, arson and molestation was registered against the duo at Ganeshpeth police station.During analysis of videos, Faizan Khatib was spotted by security agencies engaged in anti-terror operations , said top sources.He was seen in footage near Gandhi Gate and near a mosque, where a mob had gathered before attacking cops. Though he was not seen pelting stones or attacking policemen, security agencies grew suspicious about his repeated presence at two key spots at riot sites. In one of the video clips, Khatib was seen arguing with cops, who were trying to push him back.Sources stated cell phones seized from Khatib and Shahbaz Qazi will help investigators track their activity in run-up to the riots. Khatib, whose relatives own shops near Gandhi Gate, had triggered unrest in the area 18 months ago after he eloped with a girl from another community and tried to marry her.While accused, Hamid Engineer and Fahim Khan are office-bearers of Minorities Democratic Party (MDP), Khatib is learnt to work for a hardline organisation, Islamic Youth Federation , which grooms youth to reconnect with their religious roots, as per its website. Sources say Khatib, who was already under the lens of agencies, had come to Nagpur a month ago.","Faizan Khatib, an Islamist outfit member, was holed up in his Nagpur residence for 10 days after riots erupted.

We do it every day.""""Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas,"" he told reporters on a visit to Guyana.""At some point I hope we run out because we've gotten rid of them,"" Rubio said.Since President Donald Trump returned to office on January 20, Rubio has moved aggressively against students at the forefront of on-campus anti-Israel protests in response to the Gaza war.The most high-profile case is Mahmoud Khalil, who led protests at Columbia University in New York. He was arrested this month and taken to Louisiana ahead of deportation proceedings, despite being a US permanent resident.Rubio was asked about a new case at Tufts University in Massachusetts where immigration agents arrested a Turkish doctoral student, Rumeysa Ozturk, who had written an opinion piece in a campus newspaper demanding that the university recognize a ""genocide"" against the Palestinians.Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, a Democrat from Massachusetts, accused the Trump administration of moving to ""abduct students with legal status.""""This is a horrifying violation of Rumeysa's constitutional rights to due process and free speech . She must be immediately released,"" Pressley said in a statement.The Trump administration has responded that the US constitutional protection of free speech does not apply to non-US citizens and has accused activist students of creating a dangerous atmosphere for Jewish students.Without commenting directly on the Tufts case, Rubio said: ""If you tell us that the reason why you're coming to the United States is not just because you want to write op-eds, but because you want to participate in movements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus, we're not going to give you a visa.""""If you lie to us and get a visa and then enter the United States, and with that visa, participate in that sort of activity, we're going to take away your visa,"" he said.","US Secretary of State Marco Rubio says he has canceled the visas of more than 300 ""lunatics"" Rubio has moved aggressively against students at the forefront of on-campus anti-Israel protests.

Man sentenced to five years for cattle smuggling and shooting at police in Gurgaon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/man-sentenced-to-five-years-for-cattle-smuggling-and-shooting-at-police-in-gurgaon-/articleshow/119591436.cms,"Representative image

GURGAON: After six years of trial, a man was awarded five years of rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs 42,000 for cattle smuggling and firing at a police team. The accused was convicted under the Haryana Cattle Preservation and Cow Protection Act .According to the police, the case dates back to 2019 when Nuh police acted on information about cattle smuggling in the Firozpur Jhirka area in Nuh. The police received a tip-off that two suspects—Mujib from Paemakheda and Wasim alias Vassi from Utavad—were smuggling cattle to Rajasthan in a truck.Acting on this information, a police team set up a blockade at Shahpur Kheda Kati Ghati turn. When the suspicious vehicle arrived, the police attempted to stop it. In an attempt to break through the blockade, the suspects abandoned the vehicle and fled. During this, one of the accused fired at the police with an illegal weapon.After the cross-firing, the police managed to arrest Mujib , while the other, Wasim alias Vassi, managed to escape. An illegal weapon was recovered from Mujib. Upon searching the truck, eight cattle were found tied cruelly. All the animals were safely rescued and given veterinary assistance.After several months of investigation, the police filed a chargesheet. The trial lasted six years in court, with statements from 12 witnesses recorded. Given the seriousness of the case, the court found Mujib guilty, while his absconding accomplice Wasim was declared a fugitive.Mujib was convicted under the Haryana Cattle Preservation and Cow Protection Act, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act , for possessing an illegal weapon, and for attempted murder. He was sentenced to five years and fined 42,000 rupees. If he fails to pay the fine, he will serve an additional three months in jail.Additional Sessions Judge of Nuh, Sushil Kumar, in his order on Wednesday, held the accused guilty on the basis of the police investigation and evidence presented before the court.“The decision makes it clear that strict action will be taken against those who commit crimes against law and order.

However, following the US exit, Tehran began to roll back its commitments, leading to increased tensions between the two nations.Kamal Kharrazi, an adviser to Ayatollah Khamenei, had earlier indicated that Iran is open to resolving disputes with the United States through indirect negotiations, Reuters reported.

Trump order on Smithsonian aims to cut funding for ‘improper ideology’ programs: What it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-order-on-smithsonian-aims-to-cut-funding-for-improper-ideology-programs-what-it-means/articleshow/119627593.cms,"Under the new directive:

Vice president JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian's Board of Regents, is set to oversee the removal of such ideologies from all areas of the institution, including its museums, educational and research centres, and the National Zoo.



The order suggested the potential reinstatement of Confederate statues, which were removed after the police killing of George Floyd and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement.



Independence Hall in Philadelphia must undergo improvements before July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the declaration of Independence.



VP Vance will collaborate with the White House budget office to ensure that future funding for the Smithsonian Institution is not allocated to programs that ""degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.""



The Women's History Museum must not ""recognize men as women in any respect,"" according to news agency AP.



What is the Smithsonian Institution ?

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday, aimed to reshape the Smithsonian Institution by eliminating programs that promote ""divisive narratives"" and ""improper ideology."" This move falls in line with the administration's efforts to address perceived liberal biases in institutions such as universities and the arts.""Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn — not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,"" he said.He specifically mentioned the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, and another Women's History Museum, which is still in development.The President asserted that over the past decade, there has been a ""concerted and widespread"" effort to rewrite American history by replacing ""objective facts"" with a ""distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth,"" which he believes, portray the nation's “founding principles” in a negative light.Linda St Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution’s chief spokesperson, declined to comment on the executive order.The Smithsonian Institution, established with funds from British scientist James Smithson, is the world's largest museum, education, and research complex, comprising 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven of these museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.It was set up with funds from James Smithson (1765–1829), a British scientist who left his estate to the United States to create ""at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.” On August 10, 1846, the US senate passed the act organizing the Smithsonian Institution, which was signed into law by President James K Polk.Since his appointment Trump has introduced a series of measures. He had, recently, appointed himself as chairman of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the intention of overhauling its programming. Additionally, the administration compelled Columbia University to implement several changes by threatening the withdrawal of federal funding amounting to several hundred million dollars.","President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday, aimed to reshape the Smithsonian Institution by eliminating programs that promote ""divisive narratives"" and ""improper ideology"" Vice president JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian's Board of Regents, is set to oversee the removal of such ideologies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119627479,imgsize-785910,width-400,resizemode-4/119627479.jpg"
Another US judge halts Trump’s order banning transgender troops in military,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/another-us-judge-halts-trumps-order-banning-transgender-troops-in-military/articleshow/119626746.cms,"A federal judge in Washington state temporarily blocked US President Donald Trump’s order banning transgender individuals from serving in the military, marking the second nationwide injunction against the policy within two weeks. US District Judge Benjamin Settle issued the ruling on Thursday in response to a lawsuit brought by transgender service members who argued that the ban was discriminatory and would cause irreversible harm to their careers.""Absent an injunction, all transgender service members are likely to suffer the irreparable harm of losing the military service career they have chosen, while otherwise qualified accession plaintiffs will lose the opportunity to serve,"" Settle wrote in his decision.The ruling maintains the military's existing policy on transgender service members, preventing the enforcement of Trump’s executive order issued in January. The order had declared that expressing a gender identity different from one’s assigned sex was incompatible with military service.Settle's decision follows a similar ruling last week by US District Judge Ana Reyes, who also blocked the ban but temporarily put her order on hold pending a government appeal. Additionally, a judge in New Jersey issued a more limited ruling on Monday, preventing the Air Force from removing two transgender service members.Trump’s policy, which was enforced through a directive from Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, sought to disqualify transgender individuals from serving unless they obtained special waivers. The Pentagon memo supporting the ban targeted individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria , a condition affecting over 4,000 service members as of last year, according to a senior defence official.The policy has been challenged by transgender rights groups , including the Gender Justice League, as well as active-duty service members. One of the plaintiffs, US Navy Cmdr Emily ""Hawking"" Shilling, has served for over 19 years, including 60 combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Settle referenced her case, stating, ""There is no claim and no evidence that she is now, or ever was, a detriment to her unit's cohesion, or to the military's lethality or readiness.""The Trump administration had previously argued that the ban was necessary for military discipline and readiness. However, civil rights groups have countered that transgender service members have been serving openly for years without issue.During Trump’s presidency, his administration had reversed a 2016 policy that allowed transgender individuals to serve openly. The Supreme Court later allowed the ban to take effect. However, President Joe Biden rescinded the restriction upon taking office.The latest court rulings signal continued legal challenges to policies affecting transgender military personnel, with ongoing appeals and government arguments likely to shape the future of transgender rights in the US military.","US District Judge Benjamin Settle issued the ruling on Thursday in response to a lawsuit brought by transgender service members.

Airstrikes also hit key areas such as the Red Sea port city of Hodeida, the rebel stronghold of Saada, and parts of Yemen’s al-Jawf and Amran governorates.The extent of the damage remains unknown, and the Houthis have not disclosed what facilities were targeted, except for Sanaa International Airport, which serves both civilian and military purposes.Strikes also hit mountainous regions north of Sanaa, where military bases and intelligence sites are suspected to be located. Houthi-run al-Masirah satellite news network reported that communication networks were disrupted following the attacks.The US Central Command, which has been granted authority to carry out offensive operations in Yemen without prior White House approval, has not officially acknowledged conducting the latest strikes. Unlike during Biden's administration, the command has not been providing details on individual airstrikes in the current campaign.The air campaign, which has killed at least 57 people since March 15, was launched after the Houthis threatened to resume attacks on “Israeli” ships in response to Israel blocking aid to Gaza. In the past, the rebels have used a broad definition of Israeli-linked vessels, raising concerns that other merchant ships could be at risk.Between November 2023 and January this year, the Houthis targeted over 100 merchant ships using missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors. They have also launched strikes at American warships, though none have been hit.The recent escalation comes as the Houthis, facing economic turmoil and increasing internal repression, seek to bolster their regional influence amid Yemen’s prolonged conflict.","The US has reportedly expanded its targets from Houthi missile launch sites to high-ranking personnel and urban areas.

The European Union has called upon its 450 million citizens to maintain emergency supplies sufficient for at least 72 hours, citing increased risks from warfare, digital attacks, environmental challenges and health emergencies.This directive emerged as the EU reassesses its security protocols, particularly following American pressure for enhanced European self-reliance in defence matters, as reported by the Associated Press.Whilst urging to avoid unnecessary alarm, Preparedness and Crisis Management Commissioner HadjaLahbib emphasised the necessity of maintaining ""essential supplies for at least 72 hours in a crisis."" The recommended items include food, water, torches, identification documents, medical supplies and shortwave radios. Lahbib also advocated for establishing a ""strategic reserve"" including firefighting aircraft, medical equipment, energy resources, transport facilities and specialised equipment for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear incidents.The 18-page document highlighted Europe's confrontation with unprecedented challenges, emphasising significant threats to security, as the factors. The assessment specifically points to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, escalating international conflicts, deliberate attacks on essential facilities, and technological warfare as key contributing elements to this precarious situation.Crisis preparedness varies across EU member states, prompting the commission to advocate for improved emergency coordination.The EU has faced significant challenges, including the Covid-19 pandemic and Russian pressure tactics, particularly regarding natural gas supplies aimed at diminishing European backing for Ukraine.Nato's Secretary-General Mark Rutte has issued a caution about Russia's potential military capabilities against Europe by 2030.

Elon Musk Latest News: Elon Musk's 14-word warning to Dem leader who calls for Melania Trump's deportation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musks-14-word-warning-to-dem-leader-who-calls-for-melania-trumps-deportation/articleshow/119614727.cms,"Elon Musk told off Maxine Waters after she called for Melania Trump's deportation.

When did Melania Trump become a US citizen?



86-year-old Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters recently commented on President Donald Trump's action on illegal immigrants and said Trump should first look at Melania's records. ""We don't know whether or not her parents were documented. And maybe we better just take a look,"" water said at a rally at the weekend in Los Angeles.“If he wants to start looking so closely to find those who were born here and their parents were undocumented, maybe he ought to first look at Melania,"" Maxine said.“When he [Trump] talks about birthright, and he’s going to undo the fact that the Constitution allows those who are born here, even if the parents are undocumented, they have a right to stay in America,” she said.As the video of Waters went viral, Elon Musk took it upon himself to give a reply to Waters and her threat. ""At some point, the many crimes of Maxine Waters will catch up to her,"" Musk wrote these 14 words reacting to a video of Waters demanding or at least hinting at Melania Trump's deportation.Melania Trump's US citizenship is not a new controversy. She was born in Slovenia in 1970 and moved to New York in 1996 to extend her modelling career. Melania met Donald Trump at a party in 1998, and they got married in 2005. The First Lady was initially granted U.S. entry on an ""Einstein Visa,"" also known as an EB-1, which is traditionally reserved for highly acclaimed people in their field.According to her White House biography, she was granted US citizenship in 2006.

Elise Stefanik's nomination to be UN ambassador

President Donald Trump announced Thursday that he was pulling Rep. Elise Stefanik 's nomination to be US ambassador to the United Nations, in a major turnaround for his Cabinet pick after her confirmation had been stalled over concerns about Republicans' tight margins in the House. Trump confirmed he was withdrawing the New York Republican's nomination in a Truth Social post, saying that it was “essential that we maintain EVERY Republican Seat in Congress.”“We must be unified to accomplish our Mission, and Elise Stefanik has been a vital part of our efforts from the very beginning. I have asked Elise, as one of my biggest Allies, to remain in Congress,” the president said, without mentioning any replacement for the post.Stefanik's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump had tapped Stefanik to represent the US at the international body shortly after winning reelection in November. She was seen as among the least controversial Cabinet picks, and her nomination advanced out of committee in late January, but House Republicans' razor-thin majority kept her ultimate confirmation in a state of purgatory for the last several months.In recent weeks, it had seemed as if Stefanik's nomination would advance to the Senate floor, given two US House special elections in Florida in districts that Trump easily won in 2024. Filling those vacant GOP seats would have allowed Stefanik to finally resign from the House and given Republicans, who currently hold 218 seats, a little more breathing room on passing legislation in a growingly divided Congress. Democrats hold 213 seats.But Democrats’ upset in a Tuesday special election for a Pennsylvania state Senate seat in Republican-leaning suburbs and farming communities surely gave the GOP pause.Stefanik is the fourth Trump administration nominee who didn’t make it through the confirmation process. Previously, former US Rep. Matt Gaetz withdrew from consideration for attorney general, Chad Chronister was pulled for the Drug Enforcement Administration and former Florida congressman Dr. David Weldon was yanked from contention to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The former congresswoman had been in a state of limbo for months, not able to engage in her official duties as a member of the 119th Congress or to participate in the action at the U.N. The vacancy of a permanent U.S. ambassador was happening at a critical moment for the international body as the world leaders had been discussing the two major wars between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas.",President Donald Trump announced Thursday that he was pulling Rep.

The incident happened at the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas in March 2023, and the woman died in October 2024.Citing physical, emotional, and economic distress, the family is seeking damages in excess of $15,000. They claimed that the hotel was not compliant with safety regulations. The hotel staff were aware that the door was not functioning properly, but they did not warn her. Truscheke was rushed to the hospital where she received extensive medical treatment but her condition continued to deteriorate. The lawsuit said the hotel authorities were negligent, violated safety codes and failed to post safety warning.The hotel settled another dispute in 2020 after a window washer working on the building fell to his death in 2018.

Jonathan Garcia, the 27-year-old man, died from blunt force trauma after striking his head.On its website, the 64-floor Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas states that it is ""a sophisticated, non-smoking and non-gaming, luxury hotel in Vegas on the strip"" that is ""minutes away from the Las Vegas Convention Center and the best the city has to offer.""It has 1,282 bedrooms, making it one of the largest hotels in the city.It is the same hotel outside of which Matthew Livelsberger, a 37-year Green Beret who was deployed to Afghanistan twice, fatally shot himself in the head inside a Tesla Cybertruck that erupted into flames on New Year's Day, 2025.","78-year-old Diana Truscheke suffered severe injuries when the door accelerated behind her, throwing her onto the pavement outside, where she fell on her face.

Hegseth's tattoos and their controversy



Defense secretary Pete Hegseth , embroiled over the leak of US' apparent war plan against the Houthis, has been snapped with reportedly a new tattoo on his right arm that says 'Kafir'. Hegseth is not new to tattoos and neither to controversies because of them but the new one comes at a time when he is facing resignation calls from the Democrats for the embarrassing Signalgate that the Trump administration dismissed and played down.But has Hegseth got a new tattoo at all?The new tattoo has been spotted in photos of him from his recent visit to Joint Base Pearl Harbour. Just below his Deus Vult tattoo on his right biceps, the new tattoo in question appears. Social media posts claimed that the new tattoo translates to Kafir. There has been no confirmation about this.'Kafir' means infidel in Arabic.Palestinian activist Nerdeen Kiswani said this tattoo can't be just a personal choice. “Hegseth just got a kafir (uS) tattoo under his Deus Vult tattoo-a Crusader slogan. This isn’t just a personal choice; it’s a clear symbol of Islamophobia from the man overseeing US wars.""“Kafir” has been weaponized by far-right Islamophobes to mock and vilify Muslims. It’s not about his personal beliefs. It’s about how these beliefs translate into policy—how they shape military decisions, surveillance programs, and foreign interventions targeting Muslim countries,"" Kiswani wrote.""The US just bombed Yemen. This is the real-world impact of officials who glorify imperialist violence. These tattoos aren’t harmless—they reflect the policies that continue to kill and oppress Muslims worldwide.""This is the normalization of Islamophobia at the highest levels of power. What else is this supposed to mean besides U.S. foreign policy being a crusade against Muslims?""A war veteran and a former Fox News host, Pete Hegseth is covered in tattoos. Among them, the most controversial one so far was the Jerusalem Cross on his chest, which he defended as a historic Christian symbol. On his right bicep there is 'Deus Vult' which means 'God will it'.Hegseth’s arm features a cross with a sword that references the New Testament verse Matthew 10:34, which reads “Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.”On his upper arm, he inked the Greek letters chi and to, standing for Christianity.",Defense secretary Pete Hegseth is embroiled over the leak of US' apparent war plan against the Houthis.

Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295"", a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.The case was filed after his video promoting the fragrance sparked outrage, particularly from the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which places blasphemy at the core of its political agenda.Butt, who boasts millions of followers online, announced the perfume in a now-deleted video, referencing Section 295 of Pakistan’s penal code, which deals with blasphemy. The move triggered widespread condemnation, with TLP leader Haider Ali Shah Gillani filing a formal complaint against him on Monday.""There are numerous sections in the penal code, but why did he choose blasphemy-related sections to name a perfume?"" Gillani was quoted by the news agency AFP, accusing Butt of attempting to ""normalise"" disrespect towards religious laws.According to AFP, the police charge sheet confirms that Butt has been charged under both blasphemy and cybercrime laws. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.As the controversy increased, Butt released an apology video on Sunday, holding a Quran as he sought forgiveness. ""I apologise for the words I uttered during the launch of the perfume,"" he said. He also announced the immediate discontinuation of the product.The controversy also relates to the late Indian rapper Sidhu Moose Wala ’s song ""295,"" which also referenced blasphemy laws. Butt had previously likened himself to Moose Wala, claiming they both faced persecution under similar legal provisions, according to Daily Pakistan.This is not Butt’s first legal battle. In January, he pleaded guilty to illegally owning a lion cub, which he had received as a wedding gift.A Pakistani court ordered him to create 12 educational videos on animal welfare as part of his punishment. He avoided jail time by pledging to use his platform to raise awareness about responsible treatment of wild animals.Blasphemy remains an extremely sensitive issue in Pakistan, where accusations, often unverified, can lead to mob violence and even killings.The legal provisions under Section 295 have been widely criticised by human rights groups for being used as a tool to target individuals, including religious minorities and public figures.","Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295,"" a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.

QUETTA: The Balochistan government , under the leadership of chief minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti , has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities , as reported by ARY News.In a high-level meeting chaired by CM Bugti, which was attended by the IG Balochistan and the chief secretary, the government announced that it would target individuals involved in anti-state propaganda and activism.According to ARY News, CM Bugti instructed all commissioners and district officers to act swiftly against any government employees suspected of promoting anti-state narratives or participating in activities that challenge the state's authority. The government's move appears to be a direct attempt to suppress activism and dissent within the province, especially among those critical of the state's policies. Bugti also confirmed that individuals involved in such actions would be placed under strict surveillance by being added to the Fourth Schedule for closer monitoring.ARY News also reported that CM Bugti directed all heads of educational institutions in the province to ensure the national flag is hoisted and the national anthem is recited regularly. Educational leaders who fail to enforce these directives are being told to resign, which signals a heightened crackdown on any form of resistance within these spaces.This renewed focus on stifling activism in Balochistan reflects the government's broader strategy to assert control over the region, including monitoring and potentially silencing any opposition to its policies.This comes amidst the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. Activists in the Balochistan region have frequently organised protests and campaigns, calling attention to the region's marginalisation.In response, governments have implemented harsh crackdowns, often leading to the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. These actions have sparked widespread criticism from international human rights organisations, highlighting concerns over the suppression of political expression and the stifling of peaceful advocacy for regional rights.","The Balochistan government has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities.

Balochistan, a region rife with conflict, has become a powder keg as Pakistan confronts a growing insurgency and resistance movement, most recently illustrated with the hijacking of a train by the Balochistan Liberation Army.The shock attack resulted in around 60 deaths and brought to fore the boiling deep-seated tensions between the Baloch people and the Pakistani state.Following the attack, senior Pakistan ministers and army leaders held a special meeting to address the country's worsening security crisis.The Pakistan 'establishment', referring to the army, also turned its eyes towards more legitimate forms of protest.Pakistan police recently detained Mahrang Baloch , a leading human rights advocate and symbol of Baloch aspirations, igniting further unrest.Pakistan views the Baloch movement with increasing alarm, fearing the rise of separatist sentiments and challenges to its authority in the region, particularly because of Balochistan's vast area and crucial borders with hostile countries like Iran and Taliban-led Afghanistan.The arrest of nearly 150 activists, including Mahrang Baloch -- recognised by Time Magazine as one of its 100 Next Emerging Leaders -- has sparked international condemnation and raised concerns about human rights abuses and the suppression of Baloch voices in Pakistan.Pakistani authorities arrested Mahrang on Saturday under charges of terrorism, sedition, and murder after a protest in Balochistan's capital, Quetta, resulted in the deaths of three protesters.Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.Her sister, Iqra Baloch, condemned her arrest, stating on social media that her visit to Hudda Jail was reminiscent of when she saw her father behind bars 18 years ago. “Back then, Mahrang was by our side. Today, she is not,” she wrote.Mahrang has been a key figure in protests against enforced disappearances. Her father, Abdul Gaffar Langove, a nationalist leader, was forcibly disappeared in 2009, and his body was found three years later in Lasbela district, according to BBC.Since then, she took the decision to fight against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Now, the 32-year-old is continuing activism despite odds thrown at her, which include death threats, travel bans, detention etc.In December 2023, she helped organise a major march to Islamabad calling for action against enforced disappearances, which was met with police crackdowns.Mahrang's family has also alleged that authorities have denied them permission to meet her in jail or deliver food.Support for the Baloch resistance, both violent and non-violent, has been growing, especially among the youth.Many have been radicalised by ongoing human rights abuses in Balochistan, where an anti-insurgency crackdown — dubbed Pakistan's ""secret dirty war"" — has led to thousands of enforced disappearances and killings over two decades.Voice for Baloch Missing Persons reports that since 2009, around 1,500 missing individuals have been found dead, often brutally tortured, while 6,000 remain missing.Human rights groups say extrajudicial killings are rising, but the military denies involvement.Faith in political solutions has also eroded after allegations of military interference in the 2018 and 2024 elections, which sidelined popular Baloch nationalist leaders.Pakistan has been battling a separatist insurgency in Balochistan for years, with militant groups targeting security forces and foreign nationals.Authorities have often pointed towards the terror activities of the BLA to justify brutal crackdown, arrests and torture of Baloch residents.A major part of the Maharang's movement, however, is based on peaceful advocacy, which observers say presents a challenge to the state's narrative.The province, which is also the poorest, accounts for the lion's share of Pakistan’s total landmass but only 6% of its population, has been a site of insurgency and heavy military presence for decades.Activists claim that Islamabad suppresses political voices while exploiting the region's natural resources.Human rights groups argue that her arrest is part of a broader crackdown on Baloch activists. Protests, often led by women, continue in various parts of Balochistan demanding her release.The Pakistani government has not yet responded to calls for transparency regarding the charges against her.The arrest of Mahrang Baloch has scaled-up scrutiny of Pakistan’s policies in Balochistan, with rights groups calling for an independent investigation into the recent protests and the treatment of activists in the region.","Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.
