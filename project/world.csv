Youth with experience



The Chhattisgarh test



East in Focus



A Familiar transition tool



The Bharatiya Janata Party has once again sprung a surprise. In a significant organisational move, the BJP parliamentary board has appointed Bihar minister and five-time MLA Nitin Nabin as the party’s Working National President, making him the youngest leader to occupy the post in the party’s history.The elevation underlines the BJP’s reliance on quiet strategists as it recalibrates its national political and organisational strategy. The importance of the move underlined by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who described Nitin Nabin as a hardworking karyakarta with strong organisational roots.At 45, Nitin Nabin represents the BJP’s younger leadership tier, but his political career has been built on experience rather than speed. A five-time MLA, he has served multiple terms as a minister in the Bihar government, combining administrative responsibility with sustained organisational engagement.Within the party, Nabin is known more as an organisation man than a mass leader. His long association with the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha and his exposure to booth-level mobilisation and cadre management align closely with the BJP’s election-winning model.During Anurag Thakur’s tenure as BJYM national president, Nabin served as a general secretary, handling inter-state coordination and campaign execution — a phase that gave him early exposure to national-level organisation.Nabin’s organisational credentials were reinforced during the 2023 Chhattisgarh Assembly elections. At a time when most exit polls were predicting a BJP loss and the return of a Congress government under Bhupesh Baghel, the party delivered a decisive victory.As the BJP’s in-charge for the state, Nabin worked largely behind the scenes, focusing on micro-planning, candidate coordination and organisational discipline. The result confounded pollsters and strengthened his reputation within the party as a quiet but effective election manager.The elevation of a leader from Bihar is also politically significant. Bihar remains central to the BJP’s medium and long-term electoral strategy. By bringing a leader from the state into the national organisational leadership, the party is signalling a sharper focus on eastern India.Nitin Nabin’s rise also sends a clear message to party workers- organisational work and loyalty continue to matter.The BJP has used the working president model earlier during leadership transitions. In 2019, J P Nadda was appointed working president when Amit Shah was party president and later inducted into the Union cabinet as home minister.Seen in that context, Nitin Nabin is viewed within the party as a reliable, non-controversial choice, focused on execution rather than factional politics.",The elevation underlines the BJP’s reliance on quiet strategists as it recalibrates its national political and organisational strategy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi described Nitin Nabin as a hardworking karyakarta with strong organisational roots.

A hill that carries centuries of coexistence

Living together on sacred stone - The people of the hills



Who owns the hill?



When devotees moved to court for sacred lamp



A new legal question built on old legislative stones



the 1920 decree gave the temple ownership of the hill and thus rights over ritual space;

no judicial order specifically prohibited lighting the lamp at Deepathoon;

refusal to even consider the location violated fairness and procedure.

The flame meets politics



When the debate reached Parliament



The three axes of the conflict

Judicial authority and constitutional limits

State discretion in preventing potential unrest

Devotee autonomy in ritual practice

Rising at the edge of Madurai, Thiruparankundram in Tamil Nadu 's Madurai has served as sanctuary, landmark, battlefield, shrine and memory for centuries. First to Jain monks who chiselled beds into its stone nearly 2,300 years ago, later to poets of the Sangam age who immortalised it as Murugan Kundram, and eventually to monarchs, pilgrims and mendicants who left inscriptions and belief layered into its slopes.Across centuries, the hill took on meanings that were never singular. It became a sacred space for Murugan devotees, a site associated with the god’s divine wedding, a spiritual retreat that bore Jain inscriptions in early Tamil script, and by the 14th century, a place of significance for followers of Sikandar Shah, whose memorial evolved into the Sikander Badusha Dargah. As rituals shifted and dynasties changed, Thiruparankundram continued to absorb new customs into its landscape.For generations of residents, the hill's story was not interpreted through boundaries or separations, but through the shared steps people climbed and the shared festivals they observed.Today, that long history forms the backdrop against which new questions are being posed about space, symbolism and tradition. A debate that has become a flashpoint between devotees in courtrooms and a stage for fresh DMK vs BJP.Thiruparankundram occupies a singular place in Tamil Nadu's cultural and religious landscape. Recognised as one of the Arupadai Veedu, the six sacred abodes of Lord Murugan, it is revered as the site associated with the divine wedding of Murugan and Deivanai, a narrative deeply embedded in Tamil devotional literature and temple ritual.References to the hill appear in Sangam-era texts such as 'Akananuru' and 'Thirumurugatrupadai', indicating that its sanctity has been acknowledged for well over two millennia. Archaeological evidence traces the hill's significance even further back: around 2,300 years ago, Jain monks carved stone beds with Tamizhi-era inscriptions along its slopes, marking it as a place of spiritual retreat long before the temple infrastructure seen today.By the sixth century, the site appears in the 'Tevaram' hymns as 'Parankundram' and over time it evolved into a complex centre of worship. In the eighth century, Pandya ruler Parantaka Varagu and General Santhan Ganapathy commissioned a rock-cut temple dedicated to Soma Skanda, depicting Shiva, Parvati and Murugan together.The temple houses shrines for Vishnu , Vinayaka, Durga, Jyeshta Devi and others, representing the Panchayatana tradition of multiple deities within a single sacred complex.Inscriptions from the period, including one from 773 CE referencing the worship of Jyeshta Devi, showcase a layered ritual ecosystem that adapted and expanded with dynastic rule and regional belief.The history of the hill took another turn in the 14th century.During the Madurai Sultanate, following the invasion led by Alauddin Khilji's general Malik Kafur, the region came under the rule of ten Muslim sultans. The last among them, Sikandar Shah, is believed to have sought refuge in the hills before being killed. A memorial to him eventually transformed into the Sikkander Badusha Dargah, developing into a site of devotion where followers regarded him as a Sufi saint.According to researchers and local oral histories, including interpretations cited by the Thiruparankundram Jamath, a Pandya ruler is said to have sanctioned a prayer site out of repentance, a narrative symbolising reconciliation rather than conflict.Over centuries, religious practices have evolved on this hill through shared participation.One such tradition is 'kandoori', a practice involving offering and sharing of meat as thanksgiving, described by the Jamath as conceptually similar to nerthi kadan in Hindu customs where vows are fulfilled through food or offerings. Members of the Muslim community note that Hindus have historically participated in kandoori rituals, while Muslims join in temple festivals, tonsuring infants’ heads and celebrating street processions.Local residents often describe the hill's identity not through the lens of division but through shared spaces and shared customs. C Santhalingam, a former officer of the Tamil Nadu archaeology department told TOI that Thiruparankundram is ""among the most unique as it is a place where histories and faiths intersect."" He emphasises that the hill ""has never belonged to one community,"" pointing out not only the temple and the dargah but also the Jain beds with inscriptions, evidence of its long and diverse spiritual heritage.However, Santhalingam and others note that in recent months, debates surrounding religious practice have begun overshadowing this legacy of coexistence. A disagreement over a signboard referring to facilities for kandoori rituals triggered a fresh set of tensions in February this year, leading to protests, petitions and involvement from political stakeholders.""Kandoori is not an orthodox Muslim practice,"" M Arif, secretary of Thiruparankundram Jamath told TOI in February. ""It is closer to gurbani, where meat is shared after an animal is butchered. In kandoori, a person makes a wish, cooks food, and shares it, which is like the Hindu practice of nerthi kadan (offering food or some valuables as a vow).""Jamath member A Abudahir said even Hindus in the area followed kandoori and offered prayers at dargahs. ""We are not outsiders. We are Tamil Nadu's people. It's just that we have some unique customs. Even today, we tonsure our newborns' heads like they do in Hindu rituals before we offer kandoori at the hilltop dargah,"" he said.Sathya Seelan, a third-generation hairdresser, said that for generations, his family has been tonsuring the heads of those who participate in the kandoori ritual. ""A decade ago, some people earned money by carrying goats and cooking materials up the hill for this ritual,"" he said. During the annual Santhakoodu festival, much like a temple car festival, a decorated dome placed on a cart is drawn through streets, said Abudahir. ""People apply sandalwood paste to the dome in memory of Sikandar Shah. All Hindus participate and we have never had any issue. We also enjoy the temple car festival.""The dispute over lighting the Karthigai deepam is seen by many locals as part of a broader shift, where questions of space, symbolism and historical rights have become increasingly contested.For much of its past, the hill held room for many traditions at once, and its rituals adjusted to the rhythms of diverse communities. The current debates, both legal and political, revisit unresolved questions from earlier decades, but they also reflect contemporary anxieties over identity, culture and authority. As many long-time residents reiterate, conflict is not the oldest story of Thiruparankundram; coexistence is.Today, this hill is the focus point of DMK vs BJP in Tamil Nadu. The issue has echoed from Parliament o Supreme Court.However, legal disputes around ownership and ritual usage of the hill began in the early 20th century, long before the current political and administrative controversy surrounding the Karthigai deepam ritual.In the 1920s, both the temple administration and the dargah trustees approached the courts seeking recognition over sections of the hill. The case travelled through the colonial judiciary, and the Privy Council eventually upheld the temple’s ownership of the hill. It also recognised a small but significant portion of land to the dargah.Although the judgment settled ownership, it did not address ritual traditions or determine exclusive religious rights at various points on the hill. That space later became ground for differing interpretations.For decades following this verdict, the Karthigai deepam festival proceeded without becoming a symbol of territorial claim. The lamp was lit at the Uchipillaiyar temple mandapam, a practice widely recognised and rarely challenged. The serenity broke only in the 1990s, when the first petition asked that deepam be shifted upward to Deepathoon.In 1994, a devotee approached the Madras high court demanding the lamp be lit at the hilltop pillar instead of the Uchipillaiyar mandapam.In 1996, the court responded by affirming the mandapam as the ""traditional spot"". This was the first time the spot for lighting the flame was confirmed, keeping it at a safe distance from the dargah.It was an order rooted in practicality but written with ambiguity. It left the door open for a possible change in the future.Almost two decades later in 2014, another petition revived the same demand. The court rejected the plea again, asserting that devotees cannot enforce ritual preferences in court and that judges must not intervene in spiritual practices unless administrative failures are proven.In 2017, a division bench upheld that reasoning. Temple management, the court reiterated, retains autonomy over rituals, locations and modalities. These pronouncements seemed settled law. But the Karthigai deepam debate is yet far from its final chapter.In 2024, Hindu Tamilar Katchi founder Rama Ravikumar filed a fresh petition. His argument rested on three pillars:On December 1, Justice GR Swaminathan agreed with the petitioner and directed that the lamp be lit at the hilltop pillar. When the order was not implemented on the festival day, the judge concluded that the breach was clear and he permitted the petitioner and ten others to light the lamp themselves, with Central Industrial Security Force protection.However, the administration blocked the access to the hill citing prohibitory orders, a pending appeal, safety concerns and the need to maintain communal harmony. The police prevented even personnel of a central security force from proceeding, and the unlit deepam became a headline.What could have been a closed legal loop immediately expanded into a political spiral.Dispute over deepam ritual matter because they turn abstract ideology, Dravidian vs Hindutva, into a tangible battle over who speaks for Tamil Hindus, on temple steps and hilltops both parties cannot afford to lose.The symbolism is powerful: a flame, a hill, a shared sacred space. The BJP sees opportunity; the DMK sees risk.DMK has alleged that BJP is trying to use the deepam issue to create an Ayodhya-like situation (Babri masjid) in Tirupparankundram.Tamil Nadu BJP president Nainar Nagendran accused the Stalin government of indulging in vote-bank politics, claiming there was no Muslim opposition to the ritual and framing the controversy as a ""manufactured hurdle"". He has also retorted that ""Ayodhya is in India, not in England or Europe. There is nothing wrong in Tirupparankundram becoming Ayodhya. We have heard the greatness of Ram Rajya and want to implement it here. ""BJP MP Tejasvi Surya escalated the rhetoric by calling the DMK administration ""undemocratic and fascist"" for failing to enforce a judicial order. Union Minister L Murugan added that the state was ""denying the right to worship"" and acting in contempt of the law.The VHP called the situation an ""attack on constitutional rights of Hindus"", urging central intervention and judicial cognisance.The DMK government countered with a narrative rooted in continuity and caution. Chief minister MK Stalin said the deepam was lit ""at the right place at the right time"" according to age-old practice, and argued that those insisting on the hilltop location were attempting to turn a spiritual tradition into a divisive exercise.He described such efforts as ""cheap politics of the worst kind"" and reassured that Tamil Nadu remained a place where people of all religions lived ""like relatives"", protected by the light of equality lit by Periyar’s reformist ideals.The Left parties alleged that there were attempts to whip up communal tensions in Tamil Nadu by manufacturing a controversy around the religious sites. In a joint statement, the CPI(M), CPI, CPI(ML), RSP, and AIFB condemned the targeting of Madurai MP Su Venkatesan over the issue.""The Left parties strongly condemn the attempts by the BJP and other Hindutva communal forces to whip up communal tensions in Tamil Nadu by manufacturing a controversy around the religious sites situated on Tirupparankundram Hill in Madurai district, with a sinister eye on political gain,"" the statement read.The AIADMK meanwhile passed resolutions condemning interference in the judiciary and sought projection of its leader as a future chief minister. While its criticism converged with BJP’s, its rhetoric positioned itself as a defender of judicial independence rather than explicitly labeling the issue as anti-Hindu.As DMK MPs protested in Parliament this week during Winter session demanding the issue be raised, the Lok Sabha was adjourned. When remarks were made against the judge behind the order, reactions from ministers were swift, reminding members that criticism of the judiciary crosses constitutional boundaries. Outside the courts, the Madras high court division bench warned against demoralising the institution and cautioned that the judiciary’s patience must not be tested.At the same time, the INDIA bloc initiated steps for impeachment of Justice Swaminathan, alleging judicial overreach and potential disturbance to communal harmony. Impeachment motions against judges are rare, politically consequential and historically treated as measures of last resort.The Karthigai deepam row cannot be read purely as a religious issue. Three themes intersect at the hill:Meanwhile, the question of coexistence, an unwritten social contract honoured for centuries, hangs in the background.","Thiruparankundram in Tamil Nadu's Madurai has served as sanctuary, landmark, battlefield, shrine and memory for centuries. It became a sacred space for Murugan devotees, a site associated with the god’s divine wedding, a spiritual retreat that bore Jain inscriptions in early Tamil script.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125959462,imgsize-1337222,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-generated-image-for-representation-only.jpg"

‘Didn’t Go For Son’s Operation’: Kharge Lauds Rahul Gandhi In ‘Vote Chori’ Rally, Calls BJP ‘Gaddar’

NEW DELHI: As the Congress held a mega rally protesting the nationwide special intensive revision (SIR) and ""vote-chori"", party president Mallikarjun Kharge on Sunday said he skipped his son’s operation in Bengaluru to attend the rally at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan. He called it more important “to save 140 crore people.”""Didn't go for son's operation to Bengaluru, came here as I have to save 140 crore people,"" said Kharge while addressing the gathering.Kharge also launched a scathing attack on the BJP , accusing those involved in “vote chori” of being “gaddars” who need to be removed from power to protect the voting rights and the Constitution. “The BJP people are 'gaddars' (traitors) and 'dramebaaz' (indulge in theatrics). They need to be removed from power,” he said.Alleging that the ideology of the Manusmriti, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and the BJP will “destroy the nation,” Kharge claimed that only Congress’s ideology can safeguard India’s Constitution. “Only Congress party's ideology can save the nation; ideology of (Mohan) Bhagwat, (Madhav Rao) Gowalkar Guruji, or the Manusmriti will not save the nation, but destroy it.The path the BJP, PM Modi is going, slowly and steadily, they are trying to finish the Constitution,” he said.Kharge praised Rahul Gandhi for leading the fight to “save the country” and urged citizens to strengthen Congress’s ideology. “Rahul Gandhi is fighting for the country, and to strengthen that fight is the responsibility of us all, that is what I want to request you all. If you do strengthen those ideas then it is your loss, the country's loss, not his loss. If you want to save the country, if you want to save your vote, protect it, if you want to save the Constitution, then you can work for yourself. The work of bringing forward our ideology, ideas, is being done by Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, today Priyanka is also doing,” he said.Kharge also accused the BJP of trying to “enslave people under the guise of Hinduism.” “Everyone is there under the Hindu religion, but under the guise of Hinduism, they want to enslave people. If you want to be a slave, if you give up your self-respect, then you will be finished. The freedom we got (from the Britishers) was given by Congress. Did Modi give it? Modi was not even born then. Amit Shah was just a kid then. These people talk against Nehru, Gandhi, and Ambedkar,” he said.He added, “They want to pretend that Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel were fighting, and on the other hand, they do vote chori. These are traitors; you have to remove these traitors. If you want to protect your rights and become stronger, remove these traitors. On that issue too, Rahul Gandhi walked 800 kilometres.”The rally comes amid heightened political activity surrounding Congress’s campaign against alleged electoral irregularities, including “vote chori” and the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) issue. Party leaders, including Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, also addressed the gathering, with Priyanka accusing the BJP of avoiding real issues such as inflation and pollution, choosing instead to debate the origins of the song Vande Mataram.","Mallikarjun Kharge said he skipped his son's operation to attend the rally.

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Sunday held a mega rally at Ramlila Maidan in the national capital, intensifying its campaign over alleged “vote chori” and the special intensive revision of electoral rolls. The protest, held under the banner “Vote Chor, Gaddi Chhod”, comes days after sharp exchanges between the government and the Opposition in Parliament over electoral integrity.Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge said, ""The leaders of the BJP only do drama...Some BJP leaders were questioning whether, after the Parliament session, Rahul Gandhi is going abroad. During the Parliament session, PM Modi never attends the session but goes abroad...They are all sitting in power after doing vote chori, we will have to remove these traitors from power...""Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra accused the government of undermining democratic institutions and questioned the conduct of elections, as she addressed the party’s ‘Vote Chor, Gaddi Chhor’ rally at Ramlila Maidan in the national capital.Addressing a large gathering of party workers and supporters, Priyanka Gandhi said elections in the country were no longer being conducted fairly and that suspicion now surrounded every stage of the process.“Elections not being conducted properly, there is suspicion at every step,” she said, alleging systematic erosion of democratic norms.Recalling the constitutional vision of India, she stressed the centrality of the right to vote. “Our voice should reach the PM’s residence. It’s very important to understand that your vote plays an important role. Nehru ji said that the people of India, every single son and daughter of India, are all a part of Mother India. This very thought shaped our constitution. This Constitution gave you the right to vote,” Priyanka Gandhi said.She also alleged that constitutional bodies were being pressured to function in line with the government’s interests. “All institutions in country being made to bend before govt,” she said, while addressing the rally against what the Congress has termed “vote theft”.Priyanka Gandhi further accused the Election Commission of ignoring alleged violations during polls and questioned the integrity of the electoral process. “EC shutting its eyes to Rs 10,000 being paid during election process; is this poll not 'vote chori'?” she asked, referring to alleged inducements during elections. She urged party workers not to be demoralised by electoral defeats, particularly in Bihar, claiming that outcomes were manipulated. “You should not lose heart over losing Bihar, entire country knows BJP wins through 'vote theft',” she said.""In the Parliament hardly there are one or two debates in a session.When Rahul ji raised the issue, Kharge ji raised the issue that we want to debate on the way votes are being stolen through the EVMs, they got scared. They didn't agree. Finally, how did they agree? They said we will even discuss Vande Mataram...I challenge them to fight a fair election. Let them fight on the ballot paper, and they themselves know that they will never win. Today, you don't need to be disappointed that you lost the Bihar election. Because the whole country is watching that they win through theft,"" Priyanka said.The rally also follows Rahul Gandhi’s recent remarks in Parliament, where he termed alleged vote theft as a serious threat to democracy, triggering a political confrontation with the ruling BJP.Addressing the party’s ‘Vote Chor, Gaddi Chhor’ rally at Ramlila Maidan, Lok Sabha Leader of the Opposition and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi launched a sharp attack on the BJP, the RSS and the Election Commission of India, alleging “vote chori” and institutional capture.""...Listen to RSS Chief Dr Mohan Bhagwat's statement, the world doesn't look at truth, it looks at power. Whoever has power is respected. This is Mohan Bhagwat's thinking. This ideology belongs to the RSS. Our ideology, the ideology of India, the ideology of Hinduism, the ideology of every religion in the world says that truth is the most important thing. Mohan Bhagwat says that truth is meaningless, power is important. ..I guarantee you from this stage, you will see, by upholding the truth, by standing behind the truth, we will remove Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, the RSS government, from India""Rahul Gandhi accused the BJP of manipulating elections and alleged collusion between the ruling party and the Election Commission.""They (BJP) do 'vote chori'. Rs 10 thousand were given during the elections...Election Commission of India is working in collusion with the BJP...PM Narendra Modi changed the law to ensure that no action can be taken against the Election Commissioner, no matter what he does""He further warned the Election Commission against acting in the interests of the ruling party.“EC should not forget they are country's EC not of Modi,” Rahul Gandhi said, adding that the Congress would act to restore accountability.Addressing party workers, he said the Congress would repeal legal changes made by the Modi government to shield election officials.“PM Modi brought a new law to give immunity to EC; we will change that and act against Election Commissioners.”Rahul Gandhi said the fight against the BJP and the RSS would be based on truth and non-violence.“It may take time, but truth will ultimately win; we'll work with truth, non-violence to defeat Modi, Shah,” he said.Several senior Congress leaders, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, K C Venugopal, Jairam Ramesh and Sachin Pilot, attended the rally. Former party president Sonia Gandhi was also likely to be present. Telangana chief minister A Revanth Reddy joined the event as well.“Our party has organised the 'Vote Chor, Gaddi Chhod' rally at Ramlila Maidan. The Congress party has taken a step towards a decisive battle, and a large number of people will attend this rally,” Congress leader Bhupesh Baghel was quoted as saying by ANI.According to party sources, Congress units from multiple states mobilised supporters for the rally. A party spokesperson said 1,027 Congress leaders and activists set out from Jammu on Saturday, raising slogans of “vote chore, gaddi chhore” and “Delhi chalo” while travelling to the capital.Jharkhand Congress president Keshav Mahto Kamlesh said the Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee made extensive preparations for the programme. Calling the rally historic, he said party leaders, workers and representatives from across Jharkhand had already reached Delhi in large numbers.Congress MP K C Venugopal on Saturday targeted the Election Commission of India, alleging institutional bias and warning of consequences for democracy.""We are lacking a neutral umpire in this country for conducting elections. This is actually very dangerous to democracy. That is why we are going completely for a campaign and movement. The five-crore signature has to be submitted to the President of India. We are seeking an appointment... In Parliament, we also discussed this vote chori issue. Our LoP has given straightforward suggestions. Not only criticising, but we are also providing clear suggestions. ..There are a lot of complaints about the machines, the EVMs. Lakhs of people will participate in that... This is an internal party program,"" Venugopal was quoted as saying by ANI.Venugopal claimed the Congress has collected over five crore signatures nationwide to flag alleged vote theft. He alleged the presence of bogus and duplicate votes, said Rahul Gandhi’s press conferences had exposed irregularities benefiting the BJP, and accused the Election Commission of ignoring Congress complaints while acting against the party.Addressing the rally, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge accused the government of misleading Parliament and alleged that electoral mandates had been stolen in multiple states.""Answering in Parliament is one thing, but they (Home Minister Amit Shah) did not answer our questions; they gave answers from their own minds. They provided incorrect information in Parliament. We had asked how and in what way votes were stolen, and Rahul Gandhi spoke about this with evidence... We want to tell the people that the governments in power in Anand, Maharashtra and Haryana have come to power by stealing votes. .. The people sitting in power today have not been elected by the people...""Congress leader Sachin Pilot said concerns over institutional fairness were being raised across the country. He said ""Across the country today, this question has arisen that fairness and transparency are disappearing from institutions. The attitude adopted by the Election Commission is very unfortunate... The Election Commission should work with fairness and honesty, rising above leaders, ideologies, or parties, which they are not doing. .. The Election Commission is unable to answer... Unfortunately, when we ask questions to the Election Commission, the answers are given by BJP spokespersons.""""Today we are organising a mega rally in Delhi, where workers from across the country will gather and, becoming the voice of the people, will ask the question why the Election Commission is not working impartially?,"" Pilot added.Reacting to the rally, BJP leader Sudhanshu Trivedi accused the Congress of using abusive language and promoting disorder.“In the rally held at Ramlila Maidan by the anti-Ram Congress, abusive language and insults were once again used against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Videos have surfaced showing their workers once again chanting slogans wishing for Modi's death. This shows that the Congress party is now becoming a platform for anarchy instead of a political party, operating under a Muslim League-Maoist agenda. You want to praise Rahul Gandhi? Go ahead. But the use of such abusive language against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which has been done before, is utterly reprehensible. Although there is no comparison.”The rally marks a fresh escalation in the political battle between the Congress and the BJP, with electoral processes and the role of constitutional institutions now at the centre of the confrontation.BJP MP Sambit Patra said, ""Today the Congress party is holding a rally against vote theft at Ramlila Maidan. It is being said that people are also coming from other states ruled by Congress. Surprisingly, even after the discussion in the House, the Congress party is holding this rally. This same Congress party had submitted an application in the House for a discussion on SIR. Everyone in the House expressed their thoughts, and the Union Home Minister also responded to them. .. A person who always wears a T-shirt gives a lecture on khadi that day... and from that, their true form is revealed, and they fabricated a story about SIR... They made up the entire story, and when the Home Minister gave point-by-point responses one by one... The Congress party heard about all the issues. When they won in Telangana, Himachal, Karnataka, there was no vote theft, but where the BJP won, there was vote theft... When the Home Minister mentioned infiltrators, that the Congress party is trying to protect the infiltrators, then they created a deadlock and walked out; this clearly shows that this rally against SIR that is happening is an effort by the Congress party to protect the infiltrators...""","Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra accused the government of undermining democratic institutions and questioned the conduct of elections. She urged party workers not to be demoralised by electoral defeats, particularly in Bihar, claiming that outcomes were manipulated. The rally also follows Rahul Gandhi’s recent remarks in Parliament, where he termed alleged vote theft as a serious threat to democracy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125960644,imgsize-464392,width-400,resizemode-4/mallikarjun-kharge.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday criticised Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta, saying that it is not appropriate to mock anyone taking a ""Vipassana,"" despite both of them having political differences over the handling of the pollution crisis in the national capital region.""You (Rekha Gupta) harbor political enmity towards me. Due to this, it does not behove you to mock the divine Vipassana meditation method taught by Lord Buddha in this manner. You too should certainly try Vipassana once. You will like it a lot, and you will experience boundless peace. Going to do Vipassana is not called ""running away."" Only those with great fortune are blessed with Vipassana,"" Kejriwal wrote on X, replying to an earlier post by CM Gupta.The AAP leader's comments come a day after CM Gupta alleged that while Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders are trying to fight pollution by staying in Delhi, Kejriwal simply abandons Delhi by taking a Vipassana every six months.""We are finding solutions to the pollution problem in Delhi by living in Delhi itself. We are not like them who abandon Delhi to its fate and run off for Vipassana every 6 months.

We’re going … to eat now, and then this morning, and we’re going to stay home now because it’s very hot,” she said.Verena said she did not believe her son could be involved in violent or extremist activities and said her son was just another innocent individual.“He doesn’t have a firearm. He doesn’t even go out. He doesn’t mix around with friends. He doesn’t drink, he doesn’t smoke, he doesn’t go to bad places … he goes to work, he comes home, he goes to exercise, and that’s it,” she said. “Anyone would wish to have a son like my son … he’s a good boy. ”Naveed Akram had previously completed Koran studies at Al-Murad Institute in Heckenberg, Sydney. He lived with his parents, a younger sister and brother at a three-bedroom home purchased in 2024. Verena said her son enjoyed fishing, swimming, scuba diving and exercising, and had been laid off two months ago when his construction employer became insolvent.Police still remain on site at the family home to prevent public access as investigations continue into the Bondi Beach assault.","Naveed Akram, 24, was taken into custody at the scene and hospitalised under police guard in a critical but stable condition. His father, 50-year-old Sajid Akram a fruit shop owner, was killed during the attack.

Who is Paige Shiver and why her name surfaced during the Michigan–Sherrone Moore controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/who-is-paige-shiver-and-why-her-name-surfaced-during-the-michigansherrone-moore-controversy/articleshow/125928237.cms,"Paige Shiver’s background and football ties

How Paige Shiver's name appeared online

What Michigan has officially said

How social media turned a name into a talking point

The role of family connections

Where things stand now

The name Paige Shiver has recently surfaced in online discussions around Michigan football, drawing attention far beyond college sports circles. While speculation on social media has been intense, official statements from the university have not named her in connection with any wrongdoing. What is confirmed so far is limited, and much of the attention appears to be driven by online chatter rather than verified findings.So who is Paige Shiver, and why has her name entered the public conversation?Paige Shiver is known to have worked in a support or administrative capacity within Michigan’s football program. Her role was not a coaching or decision-making position, and the university has not publicly detailed her responsibilities.She is also the daughter of Jeff Shiver, a long-serving NFL scout with the Chicago Bears, a connection that has added to public curiosity but has no stated link to Michigan’s ongoing issues.Until recently, Shiver maintained a low public profile and was not a known figure outside football operations circles.During broader scrutiny involving Michigan head coach Sherrone Moore and program-level matters, Paige Shiver’s name began circulating on social media and some digital platforms.Importantly, the university has not identified any individual staff member by name in relation to the controversy.Much of the discussion referencing Shiver has been framed by unverified online speculation, rather than official disclosures.At this stage, there is no public record of misconduct, disciplinary action, or formal accusation involving her.Michigan officials have kept statements focused on institutional processes, cooperation with reviews, and compliance matters. No communication from the university has singled out Paige Shiver or suggested she played a role in any alleged violation.Experts familiar with NCAA and university compliance processes note that staff names can surface informally during periods of scrutiny, even when those individuals are not subjects of investigations.Once Paige Shiver’s name started circulating online, it spread quickly across social media. People shared old photos and bits of information, and many jumped to conclusions without waiting for confirmed details.Experts say this is common today. When a big sports program faces scrutiny, even support staff and people who are not public figures can get dragged into the spotlight. Several commentators have warned that online attention should not be mistaken for responsibility, especially when no official findings or statements have been released.Paige Shiver’s relationship to Jeff Shiver, a veteran NFL scout, has fueled additional interest. However, there has been no indication that her family background has any relevance to Michigan’s situation. Observers note that family ties often heighten attention online, even when unrelated to the facts under review.At this stage, the focus of official scrutiny remains at the program and institutional level. Shiver has not been identified by Michigan as an involved party, and no authoritative source has presented verified allegations against her.","Paige Shiver is known to have worked in a support or administrative capacity within Michigan’s football program.

Minnesota Rep Ilhan Omar who is at loggerheads with the Donald Trump administration, claimed that her son Adnan Hisri was pulled over by ICE agents Saturday and he was asked to prove his citizenship at a Target store. Omar's son was born in the US and he showed the ICE agents his passport ID and was let go, Ilhan Omar said. She said her son always carried his passport.Omar told CBS News that ICE also previously entered a mosque where his son and others were praying, but left without incident. After that, she said she ""had to remind him just how worried I am, because all of these areas that they are talking about are areas where he could possibly find himself in and they are racially profiling, they are looking for young men who look Somali that they think are undocumented.""Ilhan Omar came to the US from Somalia when she was a minor and became a US citizen in 2000 when she was 17 years old.

Critics claim Elmi to be Ilhan Omar's brother, though there is no record to prove that. They parted ways in 2011. In 2008, Omar entered a religious marriage with Ahmed Hisri.

Putin’s Friend Goes Nuclear At NATO Military Buildup On Border: ‘Balloons Fly To Lithuania Because…’





VILNIUS, LITHUANIA: Belarus' authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko has pardoned 123 prisoners in exchange for a lifting of some U.S. sanctions, Belarusian state news agency Belta said Saturday, as the isolated nation seeks to improve relations with Washington.A close ally of Russia, Minsk has faced Western isolation and sanctions for years. Lukashenko has ruled the nation of 9.5 million with an iron fist for more than three decades, and the country has been repeatedly sanctioned by Western countries both for its crackdown on human rights and for allowing Moscow to use its territory in the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Belarus has released hundreds of prisoners since July 2024.John Coale, the U.S. special envoy for Belarus, made the announcement after meeting the country's authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko in the Belarusian capital of Minsk on Friday and Saturday.A close ally of Russia, Minsk has faced Western isolation and sanctions for years. Lukashenko has ruled the nation of 9.5 million with an iron fist for more than three decades, and the country has been repeatedly sanctioned by Western countries both for its crackdown on human rights and for allowing Moscow to use its territory in the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Speaking with journalists, Coale described the two-day talks as ""very productive,"" Belarus' state news agency Belta reported Saturday.The U.S. envoy said that normalizing relations between Washington and Minsk was ""our goal.""""We're lifting sanctions, releasing prisoners. We're constantly talking to each other,"" he said, according to Belta. He also said that the relationship between the countries was moving from ""baby steps to more confident steps"" as they increased dialogue.The last time U.S. officials met with Lukashenko in September 2025, Washington announced easing some of the sanctions against Belarus while Mink released more than 50 political prisoners into Lithuania. Overall, Belarus released more than 430 political prisoners since July 2024, in what was widely seen as an effort at a rapprochement with the West.Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya told The Associated Press on Saturday that sanctions relief was part of a deal between Minsk and Washington, in which another large group of political prisoners in Belarus were expected to be released.""The freeing of political prisoners means that Lukashenko understands the pain of Western sanctions and is seeking to ease them,"" Tsikhanouskaya said.She added: ""But let's not be naive: Lukashenko hasn't changed his policies, his crackdown continues and he keeps on supporting Russia's war against Ukraine. That's why we need to be extremely cautious with any talk of sanctions relief, so that we don't reinforce Russia's war machine and encourage continued repressions.""Tsikhnouskaya also described European Union sanctions against Belarusian potash fertilizers as far more painful for Minsk that those imposed by the U.S, saying that while easing U.S. sanctions could lead to the release of political prisoners, European sanctions should push for longterm, systemic changes in Belarus and the end of Russia's war in Ukraine.The latest round discussions also touched on Venezuela, as well as Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, Belta said.Coale told reporters that Lukashenko had given ""good advice"" on how to address the conflict, saying that Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin were ""longtime friends"" with ""the necessary level of relationship to discuss such issues.""""Naturally, President Putin may accept some advice and not others,"" Coale said.","John Coale, the U.S. special envoy for Belarus, made the announcement after meeting the country's authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko in the Belarusian capital of Minsk on Friday and Saturday.

In a key development in the Brown University shooting case, authorities have identified a 24-year-old man as a person of interest.Benjamin Erickson, a 24-year-old man, was arrested before dawn on Sunday, at a Hampton Inn in Coventry, Rhode Island, following an 11-hour manhunt, New York Post reported.He was sought in connection with a mass shooting at Brown University’s Providence campus during a final-exam study session on Saturday around 4.30 pm. Two students were killed and nine more wounded when the gunman opened fire.Police said Erickson was not a current student but investigators were examining whether he had studied at Brown or had other ties to the institution. He was being held as a person of interest; no charges had been filed.According to the records, Erickson served in the US Army.He served as an infantryman in the US Army from May 2021 to November 2024, leaving the military with the rank of specialist, an Army rep told The Post.His voter registration showing a “statehood” party affiliation, according to public records.Law-enforcement officials said the shooter was armed with a handgun and fired more than 40 9 mm rounds. CCTV footage showed a man matching his description walking along a road near the campus before the attack.Shell casings were marked with evidence tags inside the building where the shooting took place.Investigators were also probing whether Erickson had long-standing mental-health issues, sources said. “The man told authorities he had been in his room the entire time Saturday when the shooting took place,” CNN said.The motive remained unclear. Erickson did not immediately appear to have any criminal history, according to public records.A revolver and a small handgun fitted with a special laser light were found in his hotel room, sources and CNN reported. Sources told The Post that the unique laser light on the handgun helped lead them to the person of interest.The FBI’s Cellular Analysis Survey team geolocated Erickson to the Coventry hotel, according to agency director Kash Patel. Police also used video evidence, tips from the public, an examination of license-plate readers and other leads to track him, CNN said.The shooting occurred around 4.30 pm during a final exam review session for an economics class run by Rachel Friedberg, who also served as a faculty associate of the school’s Programme in Judaic Studies.One victim remained in critical condition, seven were listed as stable and one had been discharged, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley told reporters on Sunday morning.“We continue to be in mourning as a community about the tragic loss of life from gun violence that stole the lives of two of our students yesterday,” Brown University President Christina Paxson said in a statement. “The past 24 hours really have been unimaginable — it’s a tragedy that no university community is ever ready for. While we always prepare for major crises, we also pray such a day never comes” she added.A shelter-in-place order was lifted on the campus, although all final exams were cancelled. “At this time, it is essential that we focus our efforts on providing care and support to the members of our community as we grapple with the sorrow, fear and anxiety that is impacting all of us right now,” school Provost Francis J. Doyle III said in a message.US President Trump also mourned the victims, speaking at a White House Christmas event shortly before a mass shooting in Australia’s Bondi Beach. “I want to just pay my respects to the people, unfortunately, two are no longer with us, Brown University, nine injured, and two are looking down on us right now from Heaven,” Trump said.A candlelight vigil was held for the victims at Lippitt Memorial on Sunday instead of the town’s holiday light celebration, Providence Councilwoman Sue AnderBois said as hundreds gathered. “We are gathered here to share light with one another in one of Providence’s darkest times,” she said.“Our hearts break for the two students at Brown who lost their lives to gun violence yesterday, and the nine others who are injured, and their families and the whole Brown and Greater Providence community.","Benjamin Erickson, a 24-year-old man, was arrested before dawn on Sunday, at a Hampton Inn in Coventry, Rhode Island.

Trump says 'will retaliate'

.





Two US service members and one American civilian were killed, and three other US troops injured, in an ambush by an Islamic State (IS) gunman in central Syria on Saturday, US Central Command said.In a post on X, CENTCOM, an American military arm that looks after operations in the Middle East, said the Americans were targeted during a visit by US forces near the historic town of Palmyra.“Two US service members and one US civilian were killed, and three service members were injured, as a result of an ambush by a lone ISIS gunman in Syria. The gunman was engaged and killed,” the statement said.The attack marks the first incident to cause US casualties in Syria since the fall of former Syrian president Bashar Assad a year ago. CENTCOM said the identities of the deceased service members would be withheld for 24 hours, in line with Department of War policy, until their next of kin are notified.Syrian state media SANA reported that shots were fired at Syrian and American forces, wounding several people. The injured were evacuated by helicopter to the US-run al-Tanf garrison near the Syria-Iraq-Jordan border. SANA said the attacker was killed, without giving further details.A US defence official told the Ap that authorities were aware of the incident but had no immediate information to provide. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least three Syrian security personnel were also wounded, offering a differing account of the attacker’s identity.The US maintains hundreds of troops in eastern and central Syria as part of an international coalition fighting IS. Though the group was territorially defeated in 2019, the united nations estimates it still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters operating in Syria and Iraq through sleeper cells.US troops stationed at locations including al-Tanf have been targeted in the past. One of the deadliest such attacks occurred in 2019 in Manbij, when a bombing killed two US service members and two American civilians during a patrol.US President Donald Trump on Saturday vowed “very serious retaliation” after the attack in Syria.Taking to Truth Social, the US president said, ""We mourn the loss of three Great American Patriots in Syria, two soldiers, and one Civilian Interpreter. Likewise, we pray for the three injured soldiers who, it has just been confirmed, are doing well.

NEW DELHI: House Oversight Committee Democrats on Friday released a set of photographs obtained from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, revealing images of several high-profile figures who had interacted with the disgraced financier over the years, including President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Steve Bannon, Bill Gates, Richard Branson and others.The photos, 19 in total, were part of a larger cache of more than 95,000 images the estate turned over to congressional investigators. While many of the individuals shown had previously been linked to Epstein, the newly released images offered additional glimpses into their associations. None of the photographs depicted sexual misconduct or involved underage girls, and it remained unclear when or where they were taken.Among the images was a bowl of novelty condoms featuring a caricature of Trump labelled “Trump condom 4.50,” with each packet printed with the phrase “I’m HUUUUGE!” Another showed Trump with a group of women whose faces were redacted. Additional photos included Epstein and Steve Bannon posing in a mirror, Bill Clinton alongside Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, Bill Gates with the former Prince Andrew, and images of former Harvard President Larry Summers and attorney Alan Dershowitz.The Republican-led committee had obtained the images as part of its ongoing probe into Epstein’s network and influence. Lawyers for the estate told the panel in a letter that the materials spanned photos and videos taken at any property owned or used by Epstein between 1990 and 2019. They added that only minimal redactions had been applied for nudity. Democrats said the production included “over 95,000 photos, including images of the wealthy and powerful men who spent time with Jeffrey Epstein” as well as thousands of images of women and Epstein properties.Rep Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the committee, said, “It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends. These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world. We will not rest until the American people get the truth. The Department of Justice must release all the files, NOW. ”Republicans pushed back, accusing Democrats of selectively releasing images to create a misleading narrative about Trump. A committee spokesperson said, “We received over 95,000 photos and Democrats released just a handful. Democrats’ hoax against President Trump has been completely debunked. Nothing in the documents we have received shows any wrongdoing. It is shameful Rep Garcia and Democrats continue to put politics above justice for the survivors. ”CNN has reached out to representatives for Trump, Clinton, Bannon, Gates, Summers, Dershowitz, Richard Branson and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing related to Epstein, and his spokesperson has said he severed ties well before Epstein’s 2019 arrest. Gates’ representatives have also repeatedly denied that Epstein ever worked for him, and Gates has previously called his interactions with Epstein “a huge mistake. ”Trump and his aides have portrayed the renewed focus on his past connection to Epstein as politically motivated. In earlier emails released by the committee, Epstein claimed that Trump “spent hours” with accuser Virginia Giuffre and “knew about the girls,” assertions Trump has dismissed as false, with White House officials calling the claims a “hoax.”The fallout from associations with Epstein has extended far beyond politics. Larry Summers stepped back from teaching at Harvard and left the OpenAI board, saying he was “deeply ashamed” of maintaining ties with Epstein. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor relinquished the use of his royal titles after public scrutiny intensified, though he has denied misconduct allegations.The latest disclosures add to the growing trove of documents, emails and images shaping the committee’s widening inquiry into the late financier’s network of influence, which continues to cast a shadow over figures across politics, academia, technology and global business.","House Oversight Committee Democrats released a set of photographs obtained from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate. The photos reveal images of several high-profile figures who had interacted with the disgraced financier over the years. None of the photographs depicted sexual misconduct or involved underage girls, and it remained unclear when or where they were taken.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125937514,imgsize-1143624,width-400,resizemode-4/image-credit-x.jpg"

MEERUT: Hapur police on Sunday arrested a local couple in connection with the alleged rape and murder of a 22-year-old woman from Jharkhand, whose body was found stuffed in a suitcase along the Delhi-Lucknow National Highway-9.Police said Ankit Kumar and his wife (in their mid 30s), ran Srishti Enterprises, a placement agency that sent women to work as domestic helps in Delhi homes.Days before the incident, the victim had been sent to work at a house in Vasant Vihar, Delhi. ""Ankit, who had developed an obsession with her, called the woman back to Hapur and confined her at his residence, where he raped her repeatedly,"" additional superintendent of police (ASP) Vineet Bhatnagar said. ""When she threatened to approach the police, Ankit and his wife beat her to death on Aug 28.""The couple allegedly stuffed the woman's body into a suitcase and dumped it in a sugarcane field along NH-9 in the Pilakhua area on Aug 29. The decomposed body was recovered on Dec 1.Police said another woman, who was present in the house at the time, witnessed the murder. ""She was also allegedly raped by Ankit, who recorded obscene videos of her and threatened to kill her if she spoke,"" said Pilakhua SHO Shyopal Singh.""Out of fear, she remained silent and later disclosed the incident to her employer nearly two months later.""Singh said the woman's employer, a resident of Vivek Vihar in Delhi, approached Delhi police with a written complaint narrating the incident, but no immediate action followed. ""As the body recovered from the suitcase was beyond recognition, we followed a pattern observed in similar cases—murders committed in adjoining districts and bodies dumped along the highway,"" he said. ""We scanned missing persons' records and pasted posters across Delhi, Ghaziabad, Meerut and nearby areas. A man from Delhi—the employer of another woman who witnessed the crime—contacted us after seeing the poster, which helped crack the case.""Police suspect that several other women may have been exploited by the couple. ""Efforts are on to trace more victims and verify past placements made by the agency,"" an officer said, adding that charges of rape, illegal confinement and other relevant sections would be added to the murder case already registered.TOI had earlier reported that the NH-9 stretch in Hapur has increasingly emerged as a dumping ground for bodies from Delhi, Haryana, Ghaziabad and neighbouring districts. In Nov 2024, the body of an unidentified woman in her early 30s was found stuffed in a suitcase along a service lane on the highway; she was later identified as a Gurgaon resident allegedly murdered by her husband.In June 2024, police recovered another woman's body in a sack from Babugarh; she was from Bulandshahr and her husband was later arrested. In Dec 2023, a dismembered body of an unidentified woman was found dumped in a sack, while another woman from Ghaziabad was killed in a property dispute and her body discarded along the same stretch.Police said the pattern remains consistent—murders committed elsewhere and bodies packed in suitcases or sacks and dumped at secluded spots along the highway, which passes through 14 districts across Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. Officials said Hapur's location at the junction of NH-9, the Eastern Peripheral Expressway and the Delhi-Meerut Expressway has made it a frequent ""disposal site"".","Police said Ankit Kumar and his wife (in their mid 30s) ran Srishti Enterprises, a placement agency that sent women to work as domestic helps in Delhi homes.

From X to face-to-face: Erika Kirk to meet Candace Owens in person — will this meeting end the feud?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-x-to-face-to-face-erika-kirk-to-meet-candace-owens-in-person-will-this-meeting-end-the-feud/articleshow/125969561.cms,"Will this meeting end the fued?







After weeks of barbed exchanges online, the long-running digital spat between Erika Kirk and conservative commentator Candace Owens is set to move offline.Turning Point USA chief Erika Kirk has announced plans to have a face-to-face meeting with Owens on Monday, marking a rare attempt to turn a social media feud into an in-person conversation.Her meeting announcement came after pleading with Owens to stop spreading conspiracy theories about the murder of her husband, Charlie Kirk She added that she was postponing all livestreams and social media posts until after their private discussion, which coincides with the date Turning Point USA had planned to host a livestream addressing Owens’s claims.In an X post, Erika Kirk wrote: “Candace Owens and I are meeting for a private, in-person discussion on Monday, December 15. [Owens] and I have agreed that public discussions, livestreams, and tweets are on hold until after this meeting. I look forward to a productive conversation. Thank you.”The question is little difficult to answer but in their previous spat, it is believed that Kirk is not really happy with Owens statement regarding her husband's assassination.Last week, Owens said she was ready to “blow this case open” with her latest theory — that the US military was involved in killing Kirk.She has also suggested that pro-Israel henchmen upset by Kirk’s “rational thoughts about Israel” or a hit squad authorised by French President Emmanuel Macron, including “one Israeli,” were responsible.Owens further implicated some of Kirk’s friends at Turning Point USA and The Charlie Kirk Show in his death. They had challenged her to attend an in-person event later this month to debunk her claims, but that event appears to be on hold for now.Authorities arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson soon after Kirk was shot at a TPUSA event in September. Robinson faces seven charges, including aggravated murder, and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. He was turned in by his family.Erika Kirk made it clear she was unhappy with Owens’s ongoing speculation. When asked by CBS News boss Bari Weiss about Owens’s comments, Erika Kirk’s message was: “Stop. That’s it. That’s all I have to say. Stop.” She told Fox News that while it was acceptable to go after her personally, she was angry that Owens targeted her family and her “Turning Point USA family.”Owens responded that Erika Kirk’s recent comments are not “passing the vibe check,” adding: “You are not changing my mind about the fact that something weird happened that day and that TPUSA is acting funny because you give an impassioned plea.”","Turning Point USA chief Erika Kirk has announced plans to have a face-to-face meeting with Owens on Monday.

Australia was rocked by one of its deadliest mass shootings in decades after a Pakistani-origin father and son opened fire at Sydney’s Bondi Beach, killing 16, including gunman, during a Jewish festival.The shooting has been declared a ""terrorist incident"", with two Islamic State (IS) flags being recovered during subsequent raids, ABC news reported.Authorities identified the assailants as a 50-year-old father and his 24-year-old son. The father was shot dead by police at the scene, while the son was taken to hospital with critical injuries. Police said the father legally owned six firearms, believed to have been used in the attack.Australian PM Anthony Albanese has proposed ""tougher gun laws"" saying, ""The government is prepared to take whatever action is necessary. Included in that is the need for tougher gun laws.""The two suspected gunmen behind were identified as a father and his son, authorities said. The 50-year-old father, Sajid Akram, was shot dead by police at the scene, while his 24-year-old son, Naveed Akram, was critically injured and remains hospitalised, CBS news cited New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon saying.Moreover, investigators believe that the duo had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) group. Two IS flags were recovered from their car parked near Bondi Beach, with footage from the scene showing one flag placed on the vehicle’s bonnet, ABC news cited senior officials saying.Australia’s domestic intelligence agency ASIO had previously examined Naveed Akram about six years ago due to his close links with a Sydney-based IS terror cell. He was reportedly connected to Isaak El Matari, an IS operative arrested in 2019 and later jailed for plotting an insurgency in Australia. ASIO director-general Mike Burgess confirmed that one of the attackers was known to the agency, though not assessed as an immediate threat at the time.The shooting unfolded on a Sunday afternoon at Bondi Beach, where more than 1,000 people had gathered to celebrate Hanukkah. Armed with long-barrelled guns, the attackers indiscriminately targeted crowds at the popular tourist hotspot.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed the Australian government and accused it of ""pouring oil on the fire of antisemitism"" in the period leading up to the shooting.""Antisemitism is a cancer that spreads when leaders are silent and do not act,"" AFP quoted him saying.Armed with long-barrelled guns, the father-and-son attackers opened fire on the packed tourist hotspot, triggering scenes of panic as families and visitors ran for safety, leaving behind belongings scattered across the sand.As shots rang out, some people hid in nearby shops and buildings, while others sought cover behind beach facilities. Social media footage showed moments of bravery amid the terror, including a bystander who confronted one of the gunmen and wrestled a weapon away. Police quickly responded, shooting dead the older attacker at the scene, while his son was critically injured.By the time the area was secured, the beachfront was littered with discarded shoes, blankets and picnic items, stark reminders of the sudden violence that shattered a festive afternoon.Australian authorities declared the act a ""terrorist incident"", with PM Anthony Albanese condemning it as ""pure evil"".""What we saw yesterday was an act of pure evil, an act of antisemitism, an act of terrorism on our shores in an iconic Australian location, Bondi Beach, that is associated with joy, associated with families gathering, associated with celebrations,"" AFP quoted Albanese saying.""It is forever tarnished by what has occurred last evening,"" he added.","Authorities identified the assailants as a father and his 24-year-old son.

Dan Elkayam



A 10-year-old was among the victims





Two gunmen opened fire during a Hanukkah celebration on Sydney’s Bondi Beach, killing 16 people, including one assailant, officials said on Monday. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the attack as an act of antisemitic terrorism that struck “at the heart of the nation. ”Authorities said the shooters were a father and son, and the incident is being termed as the deadliest mass shooting in Australia in nearly three decades, despite the country’s strict gun control laws.Police said one of the attackers, a 50-year-old man, was fatally shot by officers, while the second gunman, his 24-year-old son, was wounded and taken to the hospital, according to New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon.“What we saw yesterday was an act of pure evil, an act of antisemitism, an act of terrorism on our shores in an iconic Australian location, Bondi Beach, that is associated with joy, associated with families gathering, associated with celebrations,” Albanese said on Monday.The shooting occurred during Hanukkah, a celebration marking the first night of the Jewish festival of lights, which drew hundreds of people to Bondi Beach, while many others were swimming or strolling along the sand.At around 6.45 pm (local time) on Sunday, the gunmen emerged from a small silver hatchback parked near a footbridge and opened fire on the gathering, turning the festive event into a scene of massacre.Victims ranged in age from 10 to 87, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said, adding that at least 42 others were being treated in hospitals, several in critical condition, as cited by AP.London-born Rabbi Eli Schlanger, 41, was the first victim to be identified. A father of five, Schlanger served as an assistant rabbi at Chabad of Bondi, a Jewish cultural centre.According to Jewish News, Schlanger grew up in Temple Fortune in north London, and members of his family attend Kinloss synagogue in Finchley. His first cousin, Brighton-based Rabbi Zalman Lewis, remembered him as “vivacious, energetic, full of life and a very warm outgoing person who loved to help people.”“How can a joyful rabbi who went to a beach to spread happiness and light, to make the world a better place, have his life ended in this way?"" Lewis was quoted as saying by Jewish News.Larisa Kleytman confirmed that her husband, Alexander Kleytman, was among those killed, speaking to reporters outside St Vincent’s Hospital. The couple were Holocaust survivors and had previously shared their experiences with JewishCare in 2023.“We were standing and suddenly came the ‘boom boom’, and everybody fell down. At this moment he was behind me and at one moment he decided to go close to me. He pushed his body up because he wanted to stay near me,” Larisa was quoted as saying by The Australian.French foreign minister Jean-Noël Barrot confirmed that French national Dan Elkayam was among those killed. In a translated post on X, Barrot said France was mourning with Elkayam’s family and loved ones, as well as with the Jewish community and the Australian people.Elkayam was a member of the Arncliffe Aurora Football Club in southern Sydney and had been named in the club’s premier league squad for the upcoming 2026 season.“France will spare no effort to eradicate antisemitism wherever it is emerges, and to combat antisemitism in all its forms. The lights of Hanukkah must not be extinguished and they will not be,"" Barrot said.A 10-year-old girl who was taken to Sydney Children’s Hospital has died, New South Wales police confirmed.The Israeli foreign ministry said at least one Israeli citizen was among the dead and another was among those injured.Forty-two people were taken to nearby hospitals, with 38 remaining in care, including five in critical condition and others listed as serious or stable. Police said two of those hospitalised are officers who responded to the scene and are in critical but stable condition, as cited by the Guardian.Among the injured is a man who ran toward the gunfire and tackled one of the attackers, an act that has drawn praise from residents. He sustained two gunshot wounds to his arm and hand, and is recovering well in hospital, according to a relative.","Two gunmen opened fire during a Hanukkah celebration on Sydney’s Bondi Beach, killing 16 people, including one assailant, officials said on Monday.

'Don't delete social media apps from phone': Immigration attorney on US border checking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dont-delete-social-media-apps-from-phone-immigration-attorney-on-us-border-checking/articleshow/125966088.cms,"



Checking social media before allowing entry into the country is not a new practice for the US but the new regulations only ensure that there will strict enforcement, Canada-based immigration attorney Benjamin Green said as Canadians, who don't require a visa to enter the US, will also come under some kind of social media checking. According to a proposed rule, the US administration will check social media details, old phone numbers, unused email addresses of all those who travel to the US -- even from countries which are on visa waiver.Canada is ona visa waiver but social media checking at US border is nothing new, Green said, adding that people should not delete all social media apps from their phones, as that would instantly raise suspicion. Those who require visa will have to provide their details during the visa process but for Canadians, the check may happen in person when a border official asks for the phone of a person entering from Canada to the US.Green told CTV that if a border agent finds out that a person's phone has no social media app or the person is traveling with a burner phone, this is an immediate red flag. “If I’m an officer and I see somebody has a wiped phone or a phone without social media or without any personal emails, that doesn’t scream to me, ‘Wow this is somebody who has nothing to hide.’This screams to me that it’s somebody with something to hide.”Green said Canadians should not face any problem if they are stopped at the border and their phones are checked. “This type of a search only happens in a larger, cascading series of events. On a given entry, you’ve said something that makes an officer question some things and on and on until they’re pulling you into secondary (screening) and looking at your phone,” he said. “But the average person, as long as it’s calm, cool and collected, it’s largely business as usual. ”Green said Canafdian travelers have the right to refuse to show border officers their phones or laptops but then the border officer also has the right to deny the entry.","US to check social media details, old phone numbers, unused email addresses of all those who travel to the US -- even from countries which are on visa waiver.

Social media response:

Charlie Kirk got shot and we did a month-long pep rally. But for these folks it's ""things can happen.""

He can't even offer condolences without sounding like a complete sociopath. Absolutely zero empathy

Donald Trump on yet another mass shooting: 'S**t happens! I'm off to play golf, now. Bye, suckers!'

""But on a brighter note, we’re making great progress on the ballroom!"" — Trump, probably.

The man has zero soul. And if someone says he paid his respects….yes I guess and it sounded like it was one of the hardest things that he has ever had to say. It’s unbelievable how he can’t show any empathy.

Well at least he is consistent. He said the same thing when Charlie Kirk was shot. Oh, wait.....

Brown University shooting





Donald Trump stirred up a row after he addressed the recent Brown University shooting in Rhode Island that killed 2. The POTUS said that the institution is one of the greatest schools in the world. The MAGA chief then proceeded to say that ""things can happen"" and urged prayers for the remaining 9 that were injured.The president's comments were not taken lightly. Social media slammed Trump for not showing ""empathy"" and rather being a ""sociopath"" regarding such a heinous crime. Earlier in a post on Truth Social, Trump had said: ""I have been briefed on the shooting that took place at Brown University in Rhode Island. The FBI is on the scene. The suspect is in custody. God bless the victims and the families of the victims!""Furthermore, Trump got into more trouble when he claimed that the suspect was in custody even before the shooter was caught. He deleted the post and later said: ""The Brown University Police reversed their previous statement — The suspect is NOT in custody.""A shooting at Brown University’s Barus and Holley engineering building in Providence left two students dead and nine others injured during a final exam review. A man in his 30s, not enrolled at the university, was taken into custody. Police continue investigations, with some campus areas still restricted. Exams and projects have been postponed, while families of the victims receive support.","Donald Trump stirred up a row after he addressed the recent Brown University shooting in Rhode Island that killed 2.

Bondi Beach shooting





After the brutal Bondi Beach shooting in Australia, world leaders condemned antisemitism and how it promotes violence against Jews. NYC mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani also weighed in on the incident that left 11 dead.In a post on X, the socialist democrat said: ""The attack at a Hanukkah celebration in Sydney today was a vile act of antisemitic terror. I mourn those who were murdered and will be keeping their families, the Jewish community, and the Chabad movement in my prayers. May the memories of all those killed be a blessing.""Mamdani mourned the death of Jewish families and a prominent Rabbi who was killed in Sydney: ""While we are still waiting for all the facts to emerge, what we already know is devastating. At least 11 dead, including Rabbi Eli Schlanger, who held deep ties to Crown Heights. At least 29 injured. Another Jewish community plunged into mourning and loss, a holiday of light so painfully reduced to a day of darkness. This attack is merely the latest, most horrifying iteration in a growing pattern of violence targeted at Jewish people across the world. Too many no longer feel safe to be themselves, to express their faith publicly, to worship in their synagogues without armed security stationed outside.What happened at Bondi is what many Jewish people fear will happen in their communities too.""Mamdani further praised the ""hero"" who came to the rescue, tackling and stealing the gun from one of the shooters: ""On Bondi Beach today, as men with long guns targeted innocents, another man ran towards the gunfire and disarmed a shooter. Tonight, as Jewish New Yorkers light menorahs and usher in a first night of Hanukkah clouded by grief, let us look to his example and confront hatred with the urgency and action it demands. ""The NYC mayor-elect vowed to defend the Jews of New York and work for their safety: ""When I am Mayor, I will work every day to keep Jewish New Yorkers safe—on our streets, our subways, at shul, in every moment of every day. Let this be a purpose shared by every New Yorker, and let us banish this horrific violence to the past.""Police said two shooters were involved in the Bondi Beach attack. One was shot dead at the scene, while the other was critically injured and taken into custody. A bystander named Ahmed disarmed the first attacker, who was forced to retreat. An officer approached from behind the bridge and shot the remaining gunman dead. Footage later showed officers seizing both gunmen and pinning them to the ground. At least 11 were killed in the attack. Twenty-nine others were taken to the hospital. More than 26 resources were deployed, including helicopters and specialist","NYC mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani mourns the death of Jewish families and a prominent Rabbi who was killed in Sydney.

'Weird as...': Nick Fuentes on what went wrong between Erika Kirk and JD Vance after their warm hug,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/weird-as-nick-fuentes-on-what-went-wrong-between-erika-kirk-and-jd-vance-after-their-warm-hug/articleshow/125964404.cms,"'My Husband... JD Vance': This Erika Kirk Speech STUNS US; Then Comes Their Wild Hug





Far-Right commentator, white nationalist Nick Fuentes spilled what he claimed as inside details about what happened between Vice President JD Vance and Erika Kirk that Erika has now started distancing herself from the vice president, even after speaking at length about their viral warm hug. At a Turning Point USA event, Erika and JD Vance's hug went viral as Erika also said that nobody can fill her late husband Charlie's place except JD Vance.Their viral hug led to speculations that JD Vance would dump Usha Vance and would marry Erika Kirk to further his presidential ambition. JD Vance openly acknowledged that he would like his wife to embrace Christianity, which was seen as a public rebuff to Usha's religion. But JD Vance put rumors of his marital discord to rest and said everything is fine between him and Usha; while Erika Kirk too asserted that her warm hug was a friendly gesture.“Whoever is hating on a hug needs a hug themselves — I will give you a free hug any time you want a hug. My love language is touch, if you will,"" Erika Kirk said.But recently, Erika Kirk avoided directly answering to a question of Turning Point USA endorsing JD Vance as the president for 2028.""I do have to say, yes, I mean we adore JD, and my husband was very vocal about endorsing him, but I do have to preface this from the standpoint of we have a tendency as humans to look past...we have very short attention spans and very short memories,"" she meandered.""I would ask that we enjoy the fact that, and maybe you don't, but I will enjoy the fact that my husband worked so hard, so hard, for this past election. And I think it would be...I think it would behove us to appreciate that hard work and enjoy the fact that we do have a president in office that we voted for,"" Erika Kirk said, touching upon everything except the question she was asked.The answer came across as strange that Erika Kirk refused to endorse JD Vance for 2028 but Nick Fuentes has now claimed that this did not happen without any reason. Nick Fuentes said JD Vance came under pressure from Israel after Tucker Carlson interviewed antisemite Nick Fuentes. Tucker's son Buckley Carlson works for JD Vance and Vance was asked to clarify his stand. As JD came under Israel pressure, Erika Kirk became frosty about endorsing JD, Nick Fuentes said claiming that Erika's change was 'weird as f**k'.JD Vance earlier defended Tucker Carlson's son and said he would not tolerate any attack against his staff.","Far-Right commentator, Nick Fuentes spilled what he claimed as inside details about what happened between Vice President JD Vance and Erika Kirk.
