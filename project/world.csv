Sumy: Ukraine braces for heavy battles as Putin says Russia carving out 'buffer zone',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/ukraine-braces-for-heavy-battles-as-putin-says-russia-carving-out-buffer-zone/articleshow/110215106.cms,"Eastern Front

KYIV: Ukraine 's top commander warned on Friday of ""heavy battles"" looming on the war's new front in the northeastern Kharkiv region as Russian president Vladimir Putin said Moscow was carving out a "" buffer zone "" in the area.Russian forces attacked the Kharkiv region's north last Friday, making inroads of up to 10 kilometres and unbalancing Kyiv's outnumbered troops who are trying to hold the line over a sprawling front nearly 27 months since the invasion.Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi said the attack had expanded the combat zone by around 70km and that Russia had launched its incursion ahead of schedule after ""it noticed the deployment of our forces"".""We understand there will be heavy battles and that the enemy is preparing for that,"" the head of the Ukrainian armed forces wrote in a statement on the Telegram app.Russian forces have the initiative on the battlefield and are slowly advancing in the east, exploiting Ukrainian shortages of manpower and months of delays in arms supplies from the West.Speaking during a state visit to China, Putin said Russia was creating a ""buffer zone"" in Ukraine's northeast to protect its own border regions, but said capturing the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest, was not part of the current plan.Faced with Russian airstrikes throughout the war, Kyiv has scrambled to develop drones and missiles and staged strikes on facilities in Russia it says are being used to support the war and bomb Ukrainian towns, cities and power facilities.Kharkiv's mayor said a Russian missile strike on Friday had killed two people and injured 25 more in the city.Putin told a news conference in China that the assault on Kharkiv region was a response to Kyiv's shelling of Russian border regions such as Belgorod where he said civilians were dying.""They are shooting directly at the city centre, at residential areas. And I said publicly that if this continues, we will be forced to create a security zone, a buffer zone. That is what we are doing,"" he said.Russian forces were able to advance 10 kilometres in one place in Kharkiv region, although Ukrainian forces have ""stabilised"" the front, president Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Ukrainian media outlets in comments published on Friday.Moscow's troops have captured 12 villages during the current incursion, Russia's defence ministry said.Russia is staging its heaviest assaults in the eastern Donetsk region, according to data compiled by the Ukrainian general staff, which said the Pokrovsk front had faced the most regular assaults in recent days.Syrskyi said Ukrainian forces were also preparing defensive lines for a possible Russian assault on the Sumy region , which would mark another front more than 100 km to the north of Kharkiv.Kyiv says Russia has small units of forces near the Sumy region.""We note that the actions of Russian forces are systematic,"" said Volodymyr Artiukh, head of the Sumy region's military administration.""Shelling continues, in fact, along the entire border, with an intensity of 200-400 explosions per day. The intensity of enemy sabotage groups has increased,"" he said.An expanding front is particularly challenging for Ukraine at a time when its military is in need of replenishment.Zelenskyy signed a law on Friday allowing some categories of convicts to serve in the army, parliament's website showed.The move provides only a potential maximum 20,000 people who could join the army, Kyiv officials say. Zelenskyy also signed into law tougher fines for draft dodging.Russian officials said on Friday that Ukraine had mounted an unusually large wave of overnight drone attacks, killing two people in Belgorod region and setting fire to an oil refinery at Tuapse on the Black Sea.The attacks, a Ukrainian intelligence source said, targeted an electricity substation in occupied Crimea, an oil depot and railway station in Russia's Black Sea port of Novorossiysk as well as the Tuapse refinery.Russia conducted its own long-range attack on Ukraine overnight, but Kyiv's military said it shot down all 20 incoming drones over the regions of Kharkiv, Poltava, Vinnytsia, Odesa and Mykolaiv.Separately, US commercial satellite company Maxar said imagery showed that a long-range Ukrainian strike on the Moscow-controlled Belbek airbase in Crimea destroyed three Russian warplanes and a fuel facility near its main runway this week.","Ukraine's top commander warns of ""heavy battles"" looming on the war's new front in the northeastern Kharkiv region.

Anti-Haitian wall: Dominican president's reelection trump card,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/anti-haitian-wall-dominican-presidents-reelection-trump-card/articleshow/110222524.cms,"PEDERNALES: A prison-like watchtower casts a pall over an otherwise idyllic tropical beach in the Dominican Republic 's extreme southwest.It is the starting point of a 164-kilometer (102-mile) wall the Caribbean nation is building between itself and violence-plagued Haiti , its only neighbor on the shared island of Hispaniola.As Dominicans cast their ballots in the presidential election on Sunday, the wall -- a flagship project of incumbent Luis Abinader -- stands as a symbol of his tough, and popular, stance on migration .Under Abinader, who polls show will likely be reelected for a second four-year term, the country has boosted immigration raids and deported hundreds of thousands of Haitians, many of whom had lived there for decades.Abinader closed the 340-kilometer border last September in a dispute over a shared river and partially reopened it in October -- though only to goods, not people.Construction on the wall started in 2022, and Abinader has boasted it will ""forever change the Dominican Republic"" -- a tourist paradise with a fast-growing economy.Haiti, by contrast, is one of the world's poorest and most violent countries.Abinader has vowed to speed up construction of the wall, most of which remains unfinished.- 'Necessary' -The beach city of Pedernales is home to the southernmost of four Haiti-Dominican border crossings, each with a so-called ""free zone"" where people from both sides can buy and sell goods at the marketplace before returning to their respective homes.The wall -- built in concrete up to 1.5 meters above ground with two meters of wire fencing on top -- links the four crossings as it zig-zags across the landscape from south to north.Abinader claims theft of cattle and motorcycles has dropped 80 percent in some areas on the Dominican side since construction began, and argues the wall protects jobs and trade.Seventy percent of Dominicans support the project, polls show.""It will help to have certain controls... (It is) necessary,"" said Odanis Grullon, 29, the owner of a beach restaurant in Pedernales.At the nearby border crossing, children play as trucks cross back and forth with clothes, food and household items for the market.A rudimentary barrier resembling an old farm gate stands mostly open as armed soldiers observe the comings and goings without interfering much.The people of Pedernales point out that theirs is not the most fraught border crossing, being the furthest from Haiti's crime-riddled capital Port-au-Prince.""Gang members don't come here. Sometimes things happen, but they are cool, they are brothers,"" community leader Eleodoro Matos said.He is, however, in favor of the wall -- citing cattle theft in particular.- 'It's a business' -Further north, at the Jimani border crossing, the situation is quite different.Haitian Creole rather than Spanish is the dominant language, and the gates are made of steel.There are military patrols and many checkpoints on the roads. Even approaching the wall is off limits: ""These are our orders,"" the soldiers say.But for Juan Enrique Matos, a trader at the local ""free zone"" market: ""The wall doesn't work here.""Haitians, he told AFP, ""give their money to the guards and they let them through. It's a business.""Residents say it's also relatively easy to cross at other points, far from the official posts, through the mountains and valleys along the border.Dominican trader Brian Baptista, 25, told AFP that Haitians ""go through where they want, through the countryside or through the gate.""Some believe a wall may not be the best approach to the very real problems plaguing the island.""Migration pressure is not reduced by... infrastructure,"" Juan Del Rosario, a university expert in economic integration, told AFP.While the wall may have reduced cross-border theft, he added, ""illicit goods such as drugs and weapons"" continue to get through.","The Dominican Republic is building a 164-kilometer (102-mile) wall between itself and Haiti. The wall is a flagship project of incumbent President Luis Abinader, who is running for re-election. The country has deported hundreds of thousands of Haitians, many of whom had lived there for decades.

This requires that reserves be prepared,"" he continued.The law passed by parliament comes into force Saturday.It lowers the minimum age of mobilisation from 27 to 25 and streamlines mobilisation procedures.But in a controversial twist, it scrapped a vital proposal that would have given soldiers serving for more than 36 months the possibility to be discharged.","Ukraine has ceded ground to Russian forces since late last year, partly due to manpower shortages.

Nato mulling sending trainers into Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/nato-mulling-sending-trainers-into-ukraine/articleshow/110220092.cms,"Nato allies are inching closer to sending troops into Ukraine to train Ukrainian forces , a move that would be another blurring of a previous red line and could draw the US and Europe more directly into the war.Ukraine's manpower shortage has reached a critical point, and its position on the battlefield in recent weeks has seriously worsened as Russia has accelerated its advances to take advantage of delays in shipments of US weapons.As a result, Ukrainian officials have asked their US and Nato counterparts to help train 150,000 new recruits closer to the front line for faster deployment. So far, the US has said no, but General Charles Brown Jr, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday that a Nato deployment of trainers appeared inevitable. ""We'll get there eventually, over time,"" he said.For now, he said, an effort inside Ukraine would put ""a bunch of Nato trainers at risk"" and would most likely mean deciding whether to use precious air defences to protect the trainers instead of critical Ukrainian infrastructure near the battlefield. Brown briefed reporters on his plane en route to a Nato meeting in Brussels.As a part of Nato, the US would be obligated under the alliance's treaty to aid in the defence of any attack on the trainers, potentially dragging America into the war. The White House has been adamant that it will not put US troops, including trainers, on the ground in Ukraine, a position that an administration official reiterated Thursday. The administration has also urged Nato allies not to send its troops.But in Feb, Prez Emmanuel Macron of France said that ""nothing should be ruled out"" when it comes to sending Western troops to Ukraine. Macron has doubled down on his comment since, including after senior American diplomats asked him to stop.The govt of Estonia has not ruled out the possibility of sending troops to western Ukraine to take over rear roles that could free Ukrainian troops to go to the front, Estonia's national security adviser said this week. Lithuania's foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, too backed Macron's stance in an interview with the 'The Guardian' last week.The US military has done training for Ukrainian troops in Poland, Germany and the US, but pulling troops out of Ukraine is time-consuming. US officials now acknowledge the current training by Ukrainian forces is not sufficient and that they need better and faster training to push back on Russian drive this summer.","Nato allies are inching closer to sending troops into Ukraine to train Ukrainian forces. The move would be another blurring of a previous red line and could draw the US and Europe more directly into the war.

Robert Fico: All you need to know about Slovak PM targeted in assassination attempt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/who-is-robert-fico-all-you-need-to-know-about-slovak-pm-targeted-in-assassination-attempt/articleshow/110162816.cms,"Who is Robert Fico?

Fico, who is serving as a premier for the third time, along with his leftist party Direction – Social Democracy (Smer), emerged victorious in Slovakia’s parliamentary elections held on September 30, 2023. This victory marked a political resurgence for him, as he campaigned on a platform supporting Russia and opposing America.

Critics were concerned that under Fico, Slovakia might deviate from its pro-Western path and align with the direction taken by Hungary under the populist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

The victory in 2023 signifies Fico serving his fourth term as the prime minister, after previously occupying the position from 2006 to 2010, from 2012 to 2018, and once more from 2023. Fico's political career is remarkable due to his achievement as the prime minister with the longest tenure in Slovakia's history, spanning more than ten years.

Rise to political prominence

In 1992, Fico started his political career by winning a seat in the Slovak Parliament when Czechoslovakia was still united.

In his early career, he was appointed to the Council of Europe, where he acquired valuable political experience. In 1999, Fico established the Direction – Social Democracy (Smer) party, a political movement that he has been leading since it started.

Fico rose to power after his party won the 2006 parliamentary election, resulting in the establishment of his initial cabinet. His political position is commonly characterized as populist, attracting a wide range of voters through a combination of social welfare policies and nationalistic language.

After the 2010 parliamentary election, Fico moved into a position as a member of parliament in the opposition, ultimately becoming the leader of the opposition. His political strength was shown in 2012 when a vote of no confidence in the Iveta Radičová cabinet resulted in early elections. Fico's Smer party achieved a significant win, obtaining 83 seats and establishing a government with an overwhelming majority, the first of its kind in Slovakia since the end of communism in 1989.

In 2013, Fico announced that he was running for the 2014 presidential election. However, he lost to his political rival Andrej Kiska in the second round of voting. Despite this defeat, Fico continued to be an important figure in Slovak politics.

Fico's third term as prime minister ended suddenly in March 2018 during a political crisis that occurred after the murder of investigative journalist Ján Kuciak. This crisis resulted in extensive protests and demands for government accountability. As a response, Fico stepped down, and Deputy PM Peter Pellegrini took over.

The parliamentary election of 2023 signified the comeback of Fico to a position of authority. His campaign centered on ending military assistance to Ukraine during the Russian invasion, a position that struck a chord with a large segment of the voters. Smer emerged victorious in the election, securing the highest number of votes at 22.95% and 42 seats.

Fico established a coalition government with Voice – Social Democracy (Hlas) and the Slovak National Party, commencing his fourth tenure as prime minister on October 25, 2023.

In his current term, the government led by Fico has adopted a controversial position on global matters, particularly by declining to participate in a coalition led by the Czech Republic consisting of approximately 20 countries to offer military assistance to Ukraine.

Europe on edge

In a disturbing incident that has sent shockwaves across Europe, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico was targeted in an assassination attempt that left him seriously injured. The event unfolded on a seemingly ordinary day in Handlova, Slovakia, when Fico was approached by a gunman as he was engaging with supporters. The assailant fired five times at close range, critically wounding the prime minister.The PM's bodyguards swiftly intervened, tackling the gunman and whisking Fico away in a government vehicle.He was subsequently airlifted to a hospital for emergency medical treatment.""I was very shocked ... fortunately as far as I know the operation went well - and I guess in the end he will survive ... he's not in a life-threatening situation at this moment,"" Slovak Deputy Prime Minister and Environment Minister Tomas Taraba told the BBC's Newshour.The attacker, identified as 71-year-old Slovak poet Juraj Cintula, was arrested at the scene. The motivations behind the attack appear to be politically charged, reflecting deep divisions within Slovakia and broader regional tensions. Cintula reportedly made a ""confession"" in custody, blaming Fico's media policies for his drastic actions.A seasoned figure in Slovakian politics, Fico was born in 1964 and began his political career as a member of the Communist Party before Slovakia became its independent nation. With a law degree and vast experience in legal and governmental roles, Fico has been a dominant force in Slovak politics.Fico's political journey is marked by significant milestones, including his first election to Slovakia's parliament in 1992 and his subsequent rise to become the chairman of the Smer (Direction) party in 1999. His tenure is characterized by a left-populist ideology, though comparisons have been drawn with right-wing leaders like Viktor Orbán of Hungary.After a hiatus, Fico reclaimed the prime ministerial position last year, marking his third term and establishing him as the longest-serving head of government in Slovakia's history. His recent electoral victory was fueled by a platform that controversially aligned more closely with pro-Russian stances and criticized US and Nato policies, especially regarding the situation in Ukraine.This assassination attempt occurs against a backdrop of heightened geopolitical tension. Fico, known for his pro-Putin stance, has been a controversial figure in European politics, especially regarding his opposition to supporting Ukraine against Russian aggressions.Starting his fourth term as prime minister, Fico administration stopped arms shipments to Ukraine, and critics are concerned that he might steer Slovakia — a Nato member with a population of 5.4 million — away from its pro-Western trajectory towards a path similar to that of Hungary under populist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.Russian President Vladimir Putin , who has shown support for Fico in the past, condemned the attack. Describing the shooting as a ""monstrous"" crime, Putin said in a telegram sent to Slovakia's President Zuzana Caputova: ""I know Robert Fico as a courageous and strong-minded man. I very much hope that these qualities will help him to survive this difficult situation.""The implications of this attack are far-reaching, raising concerns about the stability of not only Slovakia but the entire European region. Fico’s policies and his alignment with Russia have been divisive, and this incident may further inflame political tensions.World leaders, including US President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , have condemned the attack. The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen emphasized that such acts of violence undermine democracy and have no place in society.Colonel Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commanding officer of UK's 1st Royal Tank Regiment, expressed his concerns to Daily Mail, saying, ""There are high stakes in Europe and the threat of a wider war only benefits Putin.""He further warned, ""This is yet another wake-up call to the West.

Xi Jinping is now Vladimir Putin's 'big brother': How Russia-China ties changed over the years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/xi-jinping-is-now-putins-big-brother-how-russia-china-ties-changed-over-the-years/articleshow/110162516.cms,"Driving the news

This is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election and the second in just over six months to China.

However, this is Putin's 19th visit to China since he became the Russian president.

In February 2022, China and Russia announced a ""no limits"" partnership during Putin's visit to Beijing, occurring just days before he deployed tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine, sparking the most severe land conflict in Europe since World War Two.

Putin's decision to choose China for his first overseas visit after being inaugurated for a new six-year term, extending his leadership until at least 2030, underscores the significance he places on his bond with Xi and his global strategic priorities.

In a discussion with China's Xinhua news agency, Putin commended Chinese President Xi Jinping for fostering a ""strategic partnership"" between Russia and China, which he described as rooted in national interests and profound mutual trust.

Zoom in

This visit is not just a routine diplomatic engagement but a strategic display of defiance against Western pressures.

The frequency and depth of military collaborations, such as joint naval drills near strategic global areas, signal a growing military camaraderie.

However, these maneuvers signal more about the depth of their partnership than actual operational military alliances. The joint naval patrols near American waters and the inclusion of Russia in Chinese-led military drills are significant developments that the West views with increasing concern.

Moreover, the economic interdependence, highlighted by China’s role as a critical supplier to Russia’s defense sector, showcases the depth of their bilateral ties, which are becoming increasingly consequential in the global arena.

Why it matters

The strengthening bond between China and Russia is pivotal as both nations seek to assert their power on the global stage against a backdrop of American dominance.

This alliance is particularly critical for Russia as it continues to face extensive economic sanctions from the West.

China’s support not only bolsters Russia’s economy but also enhances its military capabilities through joint exercises and technology transfers.

As per a report in the Economist, the flow of Chinese technology and other valuable goods to Russian weapons manufacturers has become a significant concern for the United States. According to US secretary of state Antony Blinken China was the ""top supplier"" of various items considered be ""dual use,"" including machine tools, microelectronics, and nitrocellulose, a vital component in artillery shells. These items have both civilian and military applications.

""Russia would struggle to sustain its assault on Ukraine without China's support,"" Blinken said. In a later conversation with Borge Brende, the president of the World Economic Forum, Blinken said that over the past year, Chinese technology had been facilitating Russia's production of weapons and ammunition, such as missiles and tanks, at an unprecedented rate in its modern history, surpassing even the levels seen during the Cold War era, the Economist report added.

What they are saying

""It was the unprecedentedly high level of the strategic partnership between our countries that determined my choice of China as the first state that I would visit after officially taking office as president of the Russian Federation,"" Putin said.

""We will try to establish closer cooperation in the field of industry and high technology, space and peaceful nuclear energy, artificial intelligence, renewable energy sources and other innovative sectors,"" Putin said.

""This is Putin's first trip after his inauguration, and it is therefore intended to show that Sino-Russian relations are moving up another level,"" independent Russian political analyst Konstantin Kalachev told AFP.

""The China-Russia relationship today is hard-earned, and the two sides need to cherish and nurture it,"" Xi told Putin.

""China is willing to ... jointly achieve the development and rejuvenation of our respective countries, and work together to uphold fairness and justice in the world,"" said Xi.

""The United States still thinks in terms of the Cold War and is guided by the logic of bloc confrontation, putting the security of 'narrow groups' above regional security and stability, which creates a security threat for all countries in the region,"" the joint statement said. ""The US must abandon this behaviour.""

The 'big brother' role reversal

The relationship between Russia and China has undergone a significant transformation in recent years, with Moscow becoming increasingly dependent on Beijing as it faces Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine.

Once a partnership of equals, the Russia-China dynamic has become increasingly asymmetrical, with China holding the upper hand. While China accounts for around 33% of Russia's overall trade, Russia makes up only 4% of China's trade, according to data provider CEIC Data.

China has emerged as a critical source of essential goods for Russia, supplying everything from electronics to washing machines to tractors.

However, Russia's arms exports to China have fallen precipitously in recent years, while China has become a significant provider of optics, microelectronics, drone engines, and other materials that enable Russia's weapons production. The energy trade between the two countries has also shifted in China's favor.

""It's a strategic partnership where both sides need each other but it's increasingly asymmetrical in China's favor,"" Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin, told the Wall Street Journal. ""China is not only the more powerful partner, but also the one that has many more options than Russia and the war has exacerbated that.""

Russia, with its oil and gas now shunned in Europe, has had to sell at significant discounts to China.

China’s upper hand is evident in negotiations over new projects like the Power-of-Siberia 2 gas pipeline, where Beijing's reluctance to finalize terms highlights its leverage over Moscow.

Putin, who is sometimes known for his haughty displays of making other leaders wait during their visits to the Kremlin, has adopted a noticeably deferential tone towards Xi Jinping, a LA Times report said.

No wonder, an Economist report described the visit as ""Vladimir Putin will meet his big brother in Beijing.""

What next

China, once the junior partner of Moscow in the global Communist hierarchy, has emerged as by far the most powerful of Russia's friends in the world.

Consequently, in the evolving personal relationship between the two ""presidents for life"", Xi has emerged as the ""big brother"" to Putin.

At the same time, the strengthening ties between China and Russia represent a significant shift in global alliances and power structures. The implications of their collaboration will undoubtedly extend far beyond their own borders, challenging the current international order and testing the diplomatic resilience of the Western powers.

NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Beijing on Thursday for a two-day state visit to China, underscoring the solidarity between the two allies as Russia continues its new offensive in Ukraine.Upon his arrival at dawn, Putin was greeted by an honor guard from the People's Liberation Army, the military branch of China's ruling Communist Party.His motorcade, flanked by a brigade of military police on motorcycles, proceeded into the city. Putin is scheduled to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other senior officials.(With inputs from agencies)",Putin's decision to choose China for his first overseas visit after being inaugurated for a new six-year term underscores the significance he places on his bond with Xi and his global strategic priorities. The strengthening bond between China and Russia is pivotal as both nations seek to assert their power on the global stage.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110162715,imgsize-29492,width-400,resizemode-4/110162715.jpg"

Historical context

NEW DELHI: An investment group led by Jared Kushner , the son-in-law for former US President Donald Trump , has secured a deal to build a $500 million luxury hotel in Serbia on the site of a military complex bombed by Nato in 1999.The Serbian government signed a 99-year lease deal on Wednesday with Affinity Global Development , a Kushner-affiliated investment firm backed by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund.Working in partnership with Richard Grenell , former acting director of national intelligence under the Trump administration, Kushner plans to convert the heavily damaged former Yugoslav army headquarters into a luxury hotel.Grenell, who served as the US ambassador to Germany and a special envoy to the Balkans in 2019, initially suggested that US investors redevelop the bombed-out army complex. Kushner, who also has luxury hotel projects planned in neighboring Albania, said the redevelopment will ""further elevate Belgrade into the premier international destination it is becoming.""The Serbian project will include apartments, retail space, and a memorial to those killed during Nato’s bombing campaign. The agreement involves redeveloping a three-block area and sharing profits with the Serbian government. The government will retain ownership of the site and may nullify the lease if the development isn’t completed on time.Opposition party politicians protested the venture on Thursday, displaying signs saying, ""Stop giving army HQ as a present to American offshore companies."" Lawmaker Dragan Jonic, attending the protest, commented, ""Somebody is trying to clear up the mess that they did, and they are not those who should do anything in this place.""A Serbian official defended the Kushner-Grenell deal, stating, ""The government of Serbia has chosen a reputable American company as a partner in this venture, which will invest in the revitalization of the former Federal Secretariat for National Defense complex.""Kushner’s investment funds are primarily backed by foreign investors, including those from Israel, Germany, and the United Arab Emirates. Critics suggest that projects like the Serbian hotel create potential conflicts of interest, especially if Trump wins back the presidency, potentially advancing the financial interests of his family members.In March, Congressional Democrats called for an investigation into Kushner’s overseas ventures following a New York Times report on his development plans in the Balkans. Representatives Jamie Raskin (D-Maryland) and Robert Garcia (D-California) stated, ""Jared Kushner is pursuing new foreign business deals just as Donald Trump becomes the presumptive Republican nominee for the presidency.""Kushner argues that as a private citizen, he is free to pursue overseas business opportunities, including those involving foreign governments.In 1999, Nato intervened in the conflict between the Serbian government and Albanian separatists in Kosovo. Western planes bombed targets in Serbia and Montenegro for 78 days, forcing Belgrade to withdraw police and the army from Kosovo. Nato-led peacekeepers were subsequently deployed in the province.The Western-backed Albanian authorities declared Kosovo’s independence in 2008. However, Serbia and several countries, including Russia and China, still consider Kosovo Serbian territory.",An investment group led by Jared Kushner has secured a deal to build a $500 million luxury hotel in Serbia. The hotel will be built on the site of a military complex bombed by Nato in 1999. Critics suggest that projects like the Serbian hotel create potential conflicts of interest.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110214372,imgsize-681030,width-400,resizemode-4/110214372.jpg"

At least two of the deaths were caused by falling trees and another happened when a crane blew over in strong winds, officials said.Houston's streets were flooded and trees and power lines were down across the region. Whitmire said wind speeds reached 100 mph (160 kph) ""with some twisters."" Whitmire said the powerful gusts were reminiscent of 2008's Hurricane Ike, which pounded the city.""Stay at home tonight.

New York City said 'no injuries' at Columbia arrests; students' medical records say otherwise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-york-city-said-no-injuries-at-columbia-arrests-students-medical-records-say-otherwise/articleshow/110205891.cms,"'We are unarmed!'

NEW YORK: After the arrests of pro-Palestine student protesters occupying a Columbia University building last month, New York Mayor Eric Adams and senior police officials repeatedly said there were ""no injuries,"" no ""violent clashes"" and minimal force used.But at least nine of the 46 protesters arrested inside the barricaded Hamilton Hall on April 30 sustained injuries beyond minor scrapes and bruises, according to medical records, photographs shared by protesters, and interviews.The documented injuries included a fractured eye socket, concussions, an ankle sprain, cuts, and injured wrists and hands from tight plastic flexicuffs.All of the 46 protesters arrested inside Hamilton were charged with third-degree trespass, a misdemeanor. The arrests came after Columbia President Minouche Shafik, in a hotly debated decision, called in police hours into the occupation at the epicenter of a student protest movement that has spread to campuses around the world. Other university officials across the country also have called in police to quell pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel protest camps.Reuters shared details of the protesters' injuries and accounts with the mayor's office, New York police and Columbia. None disputed the injuries. The mayor's office and the police said officers acted professionally.At least three injured protesters arrested inside Hamilton were taken by police to hospitals that night while still in custody, time-stamped hospital records show.Other protesters, who are demanding Columbia divest from arms makers and other companies that support Israel's government, had their injuries documented by volunteer doctors who provide support to people arrested by police and met them outside moments after their release from custody on May 2. Some then sought medical attention at clinics.""I was slammed downward to the ground and, when I turned my head to see if there were any comrades who needed assistance, an officer kicked me in the eye and I went straight down, and there was that buzzing and sharp ringing in the ears,"" said Christopher Holmes, a 25-year-old graduate student at the Columbia affiliate college Union Theological Seminary. Moments later, an officer slammed the left side of his forehead into the floor of Hamilton Hall, Holmes said.His eye still swollen days after his release, a friend took him to a Manhattan hospital. Hospital records show doctors determined his eye socket was fractured and that he was concussed.Kayla Mamelak, a spokesperson for the mayor, declined to say when the mayor first learned that protesters had been injured. At a May 1 press conference with police leaders, Adams said the arrests were ""organized, calm, and that there were no injuries.""Mamelak wrote in an email that the arrests, which involved hundreds of armed officers in riot gear, were ""a complicated operation"" handled ""with professionalism and respect.""A police spokesperson, who declined to give their name, also did not dispute the protesters' injuries, writing in an email that officers responded ""swiftly, professionally, and effectively.""Both spokespeople declined to provide unedited videos from officers' body-worn cameras and use-of-force and injuries reports from the arrests. That night, police ordered students outside Hamilton into dormitories and forced journalists off campus.Columbia spokesperson Ben Chang said he would answer Reuters queries by May 10, but did not send replies by that date and did not respond to subsequent emails and phone calls.As police used electric saws to cut through barricades of heavy furniture and bike chains, several protesters said they sat on the floor in Hamilton's lobby, hands raised. Police threw in a flash-bang grenade, setting off disorienting loud bangs and bursts of light, before rushing through the doors.Gabriel Yancy, a 24-year-old research assistant who has since been fired from his job in a Columbia neuroscience laboratory, said he watched officers throw some protesters to the ground, step on at least three protesters, and kick at least one in the torso.Aidan Parisi, a 27-year-old student in Columbia's social work department, recalled police ""stepping on top of people, throwing people,"" and said that several protesters yelled, ""We are unarmed!""Several students said officers knelt forcefully on their backs. New York City passed a law in 2020 prohibiting police from using knee restraints that compress the diaphragm.Gideon Oliver, a civil rights lawyer who now represents some of the arrested students, was involved in a reform agreement that the New York state attorney general reached with the New York Police Department last year to end its ""pattern of excessive force"" against protesters.""Now is the time for the city and for the police department to deescalate and to stop engaging in tactics on the streets that appear designed to chill protests,"" Oliver said.","At least nine of the 46 protesters arrested inside the barricaded Hamilton Hall on April 30 sustained injuries.

US military says first aid shipment has been driven across a newly built US pier into the Gaza Strip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-military-says-first-aid-shipment-has-been-driven-across-a-newly-built-us-pier-into-the-gaza-strip/articleshow/110198552.cms,"WASHINGTON: Trucks carrying badly needed aid for the Gaza Strip rolled across a newly built US floating pier into the besieged enclave for the first time Friday as Israeli restrictions on border crossings and heavy fighting hinder food and other supplies reaching people there.The shipment is the first in an operation that American military officials anticipate could scale up to 150 truckloads a day entering the Gaza Strip as Israel presses in on the southern city of Rafah as its 7-month offensive against Hamas rages on.But the US and aid groups also warn that the pier project is not considered a substitute for land deliveries that could bring in all the food, water and fuel needed in Gaza. Before the war, more than 500 truckloads entered Gaza on an average day.The operation's success also remains tenuous due to the risk of militant attack, logistical hurdles and a growing shortage of fuel for the trucks to run due to the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Israel's offensive since then has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, local health officials say, while hundreds more have been killed in the West Bank.The US military 's Central Command acknowledged the aid movement in a statement Friday, saying the first aid crossed into Gaza at 9 a.m. It said no American troops went ashore in the operation.“This is an ongoing, multinational effort to deliver additional aid to Palestinian civilians in Gaza via a maritime corridor that is entirely humanitarian in nature, and will involve aid commodities donated by a number of countries and humanitarian organizations,” the command said.Troops finished installing the floating pier on Thursday. Hours later, the Pentagon said that humanitarian aid would soon begin flowing and that no backups were expected in the distribution process, which is being coordinated by the United Nations.The U.N., however, said fuel deliveries brought through land routes have all but stopped and this will make it extremely difficult to bring the aid to Gaza’s people.“We desperately need fuel,” U.N. deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said. “It doesn’t matter how the aid comes, whether it’s by sea or whether by land, without fuel, aid won’t get to the people.”Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said the issue of fuel deliveries comes up in all US conversations with the Israelis. She also said the plan is to begin slowly with the sea route and ramp up the truck deliveries over time as they work the kinks out of the system.Aid agencies say they are running out of food in southern Gaza and fuel is dwindling, while the US Agency for International Development and the World Food Program say famine has taken hold in Gaza’s north.Israel asserts it places no limits on the entry of humanitarian aid and blames the U.N. for delays in distributing goods entering Gaza. The U.N. says fighting, Israeli fire and chaotic security conditions have hindered delivery. Israel also fears Hamas will use the fuel in its fight against Israeli troops.Under pressure from the US, Israel has in recent weeks opened a pair of crossings to deliver aid into hard-hit northern Gaza and said that a series of Hamas attacks on the main crossing, Kerem Shalom, have disrupted the flow of goods. There's also been violent protests by Israelis disrupting aid shipments.Israel recently seized the key Rafah border crossing in its push against Hamas around that city on the Egyptian border, raising fears about civilians' safety while also cutting off the main entry for aid into the Gaza Strip.US President Joe Biden ordered the pier project, expected to cost $320 million. The boatloads of aid will be deposited at a port facility built by the Israelis just southwest of Gaza City and then distributed by aid groups.US officials said the initial shipment totaled as much as 500 tons of aid. The US has closely coordinated with Israel on how to protect the ships and personnel working on the beach.But there are still questions on how aid groups will safely operate in Gaza to distribute food, said Sonali Korde, assistant to the administrator of USAID's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, which is helping with logistics.“There is a very insecure operating environment” and aid groups are still struggling to get clearance for their planned movements in Gaza, Korde said.The fear follows an Israeli strike last month that killed seven relief workers from World Central Kitchen whose trip had been coordinated with Israeli officials and the deaths of other aid personnel during the war.Pentagon officials have made it clear that security conditions will be monitored closely and could prompt a shutdown of the maritime route , even just temporarily. Navy Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, a deputy commander at the US military’s Central Command, told reporters Thursday that “we are confident in the ability of this security arrangement to protect those involved.”Already, the site has been targeted by mortar fire during its construction, and Hamas has threatened to target any foreign forces who “occupy” the Gaza Strip.Biden has made it clear that there will be no US forces on the ground in Gaza, so third-country contractors will drive the trucks onto the shore. Cooper said “the United Nations will receive the aid and coordinate its distribution into Gaza.”The World Food Program will be the UN agency handling the aid, officials said.Israeli forces are in charge of security on shore, but there are also two US Navy warships nearby that can protect US troops and others.The aid for the sea route is collected and inspected in Cyprus, then loaded onto ships and taken about 200 miles (320 kilometers) to a large floating pier built by the US off the Gaza coast. There, the pallets are transferred onto the trucks that then drive onto the Army boats. Once the trucks drop off the aid on shore, they immediately turn around the return to the boats.",Trucks carrying badly needed aid for the Gaza Strip rolled across a newly built US floating pier into the besieged enclave for the first time Friday.

He emphasized the importance of China and Russia as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and major emerging markets.Prior to Putin's visit, Chinese President Xi Jinping concluded a five-day tour of Europe, visiting France, Serbia, and Hungary. During his trip, he promoted Beijing's vision of a multipolar world and engaged in discussions on trade, investments, and Russia's war in Ukraine. In France, President Emmanuel Macron welcomed Xi with luxury cognac and a trip to his childhood haunt in the Pyrenees mountains, while in Serbia, President Aleksandar Vucic organized a grand welcome with a large crowd chanting ""China, China"" and waving Chinese flags.Analysts suggest that Xi's primary objective with the European visit was to advocate for a world with reduced US dominance and to manage the damage to China's ties with the European Union amidst growing trade tensions. These tensions arise from the threat of European tariffs and an investigation into Chinese subsidies for electric vehicles, which officials claim are harming local industries.(With inputs from agencies)","The United States has expressed its disapproval of China's stance on the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

The development comes after Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa on Tuesday while hearing an appeal by the government against annulment of certain changes in the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) laws by the previous government had ordered the authorities to present Khan virtually for his statement.Khan, 71, had challenged the tweaks in the NAB laws and the top court in September last year had accepted his plea which reopened dozens of cases of alleged corruption against some leading politicians, including Nawaz Sharif.A five-member Supreme Court larger bench, headed by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa and comprising Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Hasan Azhar Rizvi heard the case.Khan appeared as a petitioner through video link in the case, but the hearing was not live streamed unlike the current practice, which had been in vogue since the top judge started it last year after becoming the chief justice.Consequently, Khan's followers could not see him live for the first time since he was arrested in August last year.However, his party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) shared a picture of the purported video call, with a laptop screen showing Khan seated in a room wearing a light-blue shirt, and seemingly uninterested as he rested his face on his hand.The party in a statement said that there was no live stream from the apex court as the registrar maintained that it was the prerogative of the bench to decide if or not the hearing is to be broadcasted live.""Judicial process demands fairness and openness, (and) transparency can only be ensured through public view of proceedings.

Notably, his sentences in two distinct Toshakhana cases were suspended by the IHC.During Tuesday's court session, NAB Special Prosecutor Amjad Pervaiz had indicated that the trial of the former premier and his spouse was nearing completion in his closing remarks.Last December, the National Accountability Bureau launched an inquiry against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Khan, his wife Bushra Bibi, and others, regarding the alleged acquisition of numerous acres of land under the guise of Al Qadir University Trust. This purportedly resulted in a reported loss of 190 million pounds to the national treasury.In a bail petition filed in November of the same year, Khan asserted that the NAB, allegedly acting as a tool of the previous Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government, was politically targeting him through this case, as per Dawn.The Al-Qadir Trust matter revolves around the settlement of 190 million pounds (approximately Rs 50 billion), transferred to Pakistan by the UK's National Crime Agency following its recovery from a Pakistani real estate magnate. During his tenure as prime minister, Khan opted to allow the businessman to utilize the funds to partially settle a fine of around Rs 450 billion, previously imposed by the Supreme Court, instead of depositing it into the national treasury.","Imran Khan was granted bail by Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday in a land corruption case.

Britain and US sound alarm over growing Chinese cyber threat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-and-us-sound-alarm-over-growing-chinese-cyber-threat/articleshow/110124509.cms,"BIRMINGHAM: US and British officials warned on Tuesday of a growing cyber threat from China, with the White House cyber director saying Beijing was capable of causing havoc in cyberspace and a UK spy agency chief warning of an ""epoch-defining"" challenge.Anxiety has been increasing in the United States and Europe about alleged Chinese cyber and espionage activity, but Beijing has denied the accusations.""China poses a genuine and increasing cyber risk to the UK,"" Anne Keast-Butler, director of Britain 's Government Communications Headquarters ( GCHQ ) eavesdropping agency, told a security conference in the central English city of Birmingham.She said the response to Beijing's activities was GCHQ's top priority, and that coercive and destabilising actions by China threatened international norms.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Monday Britain faced a threat from ""an axis of authoritarian states like Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China"", and British prosecutors charged three men with assisting Hong Kong's foreign intelligence service in Britain. China dismissed the case as a fabrication.Britain said on Tuesday it had summoned China's ambassador to say cyberattacks and reports of espionage links were not acceptable.Keast-Butler, who was appointed GCHQ chief last year, echoed Sunak in saying the next few years would be dangerous and transformational.""Russia and Iran pose immediate threats, but China is the 'epoch-defining' challenge,"" she said.US National Cyber Director Harry Coker told the conference that Chinese military hackers were circumventing US defences in cyberspace and targeting US interests at an ""unprecedented scale"".""In a crisis or conflict scenario, China could use their pre-positioned cyber capabilities to wreak havoc in civilian infrastructure and deter US military action,"" he said.US officials confronted Beijing last month about a sweeping cyberespionage campaign dubbed ""Volt Typhoon"" in which Chinese hackers broke into dozens of American critical infrastructure organisations, using a vast global network of compromised personal computers and servers.FBI Director Christopher Wray suggested it was linked to China's broader intent to deter the US from defending Taiwan. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said Volt Typhoon was unrelated to China's government.The arrest of alleged Chinese spies, and accusations Chinese state-backed hackers stole data from Britain's elections watchdog and carried out surveillance operations, have increased strains in relations between Britain and China.Sunak said last month Chinese state-affiliated actors had conducted "" malicious cyber campaigns "" against British lawmakers and British media, citing government sources, said China was behind a hack on the British armed forces' payments system. Beijing said the accusations were absurd.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told a press conference on Tuesday that Britain had repeatedly hyped allegations about Chinese spies and cyberattacks.","US and British officials warn of growing cyber threat from China.

No single action represents a red line,"" Dowden said on the sidelines of a UK-Saudi trade conference in Riyadh.""As the foreign secretary set out a few days ago, we are confident with continuing with those arms exports,"" he said.Earlier this month the United States withheld a shipment of thousands of heavy bombs, out of concern at Israel's slow-rolling assault in Rafah, where Washington opposes a major Israeli invasion without civilian safeguards.But UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said on Sunday that banning British arms exports to Israel would strengthen Hamas .""The action by Israel in respect to Rafah is not something that is going to, in of itself, trigger a change in the position from the UK government vis-a-vis arms exports,"" said Dowden. He was speaking in response to a question about whether the UK would cease issuing licences to UK weapons makers if Israel launched its operation in Rafah.Israeli tanks pushed into Rafah on Tuesday, forcing civilians to scramble to find safety. More than a million Gazans took sanctuary in Rafah after Israel ordered evacuations from northern Gaza in October, and are now struggling to find the means to flee again.""In respect to Rafah, what we continue to do is engage with the Israelis about our concerns about getting aid in and about the proper conduct of any offensive to make sure that we minimize civilian casualties,"" Dowden.Israel's international allies and aid groups have repeatedly warned against a ground incursion into Rafah, which borders Egypt and where Israel says four Hamas battalions are holed up. Israel has vowed to press on into Rafah even without its allies' support, in order to root out remaining Hamas fighters.The Palestinian death toll in the war has now surpassed 35,000, with 57 killed in the past 24 hours, according to Gaza health officials, whose figures do not differentiate between civilians and fighters.","Britain will continue to approve arm exports to Israel, Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden tells Reuters.

French police fatally shoot a man suspected of setting fire to a synagogue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/french-police-shoot-and-kill-man-who-set-fire-to-synagogue/articleshow/110216482.cms,"ROUEN: French police shot and killed a man armed with a knife and a metal bar who is suspected of having started a fire that charred and blackened the insides of a synagogue in the Normandy city of Rouen early Friday, an attack the interior minister said was “clearly” antisemitic and which infuriated Jewish leaders facing a surge in hate crimes since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war.The suspected arsonist was an Algerian national who wasn’t flagged as a potential extremist, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said after inspecting the fire-damaged synagogue. He said the man had sought permission to stay in France for medical treatment and, after it was refused, had been placed on a police wanted list for possible return back to his country.Darmanin praised the 25-year-old police officer for using his service weapon against the “particularly dangerous, particularly violent"" assailant who rushed at him with a knife, declaring: “He was right to do so.”The minister said the officer would be decorated for his “extremely courageous, extremely professional” behavior.“This antisemitic act in Rouen affects all of us, deeply,” he said. France is “extremely determined to continue protecting all the Jews of France, wherever they are, who must practice their religion without fear.""In the wake of the Israel-Hamas war, antisemitic acts have surged in France, which has the largest Jewish and Muslim populations in Western Europe. France has also seen pro-Palestinian protests in major cities and students occupying university campuses in support of Palestinians in Gaza.The main French Jewish umbrella group described the synagogue blaze as “a scandalous message” and “a way of saying that Jews don’t belong in French society.” This week, a Paris memorial honoring people who distinguished themselves by helping to rescue Jews in France during the country’s Nazi occupation in World War II was also attacked, defaced with painted blood-red hands.“It’s unbearable. It’s more and more serious every day. After the antisemitic graffiti we saw in the past few days, antisemitic slogans, antisemitic insults, we now have attempts at setting synagogues on fire,” said Yonathan Arfi, president of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France.“Everyone is wondering whether they can live a peaceful life in France as a Jew,” he added, speaking in an Associated Press interview. “There’s a climate of fear because it feels like, anywhere in our country and at any time, an antisemitic attack can take place. It aims at intimidating French Jews and we won’t accept this intimidation. We refuse it, and we will continue to fight against this unbridled antisemitism.”Firefighters were alerted early Friday morning to the blaze at the synagogue. Police officers discovered the man on the roof of the building, clutching the metal bar in one hand and the kitchen knife in the other, and smoke rising from the synagogue's windows, Rouen prosecutor Frédéric Teillet said.He said the man hurled abuse and threw the metal bar at the police before jumping off the roof and then running at one of the officers with his knife raised.The officer fired five shots, hitting the man four times, fatally wounding him, the prosecutor said.Rouen Mayor Nicolas Mayer-Rossignol said that the man is thought to have climbed onto a trash container and thrown “a sort of Molotov cocktail” inside the synagogue, starting the fire and causing “significant damage.”“When the Jewish community is attacked, it's an attack on the national community, an attack on France, an attack on all French citizens,"" he said. “It’s a fright for the whole nation.""Hours later, the inside of the synagogue still smelled of fire, although the building was largely intact. A couple of walls were charred and damaged and wooden cabinets adorned with the Star of David where the Torah is stored for services were blistered and blackened.“It’s a catastrophe,” said Natacha Ben Haim, head of Rouen's Jewish community. “The assailant threw an incendiary object inside through a small dormer that he most certainly broke into. The fire started then, very quickly apparently, and the damage is considerable. We managed to save the Sefer Torah, but parts of the wall fell, from the ceiling, too.”The synagogue's rabbi, Chmouel Lubecki, urged community members to light candles and attend Friday night services for the Jewish sabbath to show strength and unity.“We need to be strong,” he said. ""Don’t let the antisemitism take our Judaism.""French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said this month that the sharp spike in antisemitic acts in France that followed the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel has continued into this year.Authorities registered 366 antisemitic acts in the first three months of 2024, a 300% increase over the same period last year, Attal said. More than 1,200 antisemitic acts were reported in the last three months of 2023 — which was three times more than in the whole of 2022, he said.“We are witnessing an explosion of hatred,” he said.","French police shot and killed a man armed with a knife and a metal bar.

Slovakia plunged into uncertainty after PM shooting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/slovakia-plunged-into-uncertainty-after-pm-shooting/articleshow/110215877.cms,"Fico's ally, Kalinak

Moves on the media

BRATISLAVA: The shock attack on Slovakia 's leader has put a question mark over the direction of his Russia-friendly government, which some analysts believe could respond by clamping down on critics.Slovak prime minister Robert Fico , 59, suffered multiple gunshot wounds on Wednesday while speaking with the public after an off-site cabinet meeting.Police immediately detained suspected gunman Juraj Cintula and charged the 71-year-old writer with attempted murder.But with Fico still hospitalised in a serious condition, there has been speculation over what comes next.Political analyst Tomas Koziak said members of Fico's Smer party were ""horrified"" because he runs a ""one-man party"".""They do not know what will happen to their party,"" said Koziak, a University of International Business ISM analyst.""If Fico's injury were to disqualify him from political activity, this would mean a really huge problem for Smer.""Fico's closest ally is defence minister Robert Kalinak , who is also one of four deputy premiers. Asked who would fill in for the leader, he offered no name to reporters.""The government functions, there are deputies... I don't see any special problem,"" he said.Kalinak is ""the obvious candidate to take over from Fico for at the least the next few months,"" said Marcin Zaborowski from the Globsec think tank.""He is a moderate but he won't do anything to distinguish himself from Fico in foreign policy,"" the expert told.""He has repeatedly shown his loyalty to Fico... But his tone will be softer.""Fico is a veteran politician whose remarks on Ukraine -- including questioning its sovereignty -- have soured ties between Slovakia and its neighbour.After he was elected last year, Slovakia stopped sending weapons to Ukraine, invaded by Russia in 2022.Were Fico to recover quickly, analyst Pavol Babos said he would likely take on a conciliatory tone that could woo new voters and strengthen Smer.But ""Fico is a politician of many faces, so it is very difficult to predict,"" Babos told.""Fico put on a conciliatory face, for example, when he won the parliamentary election. We also saw his very aggressive face during the electoral campaign.""Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban on Friday said he was praying for political ally Fico.But ""even if the prime minister recovers, he will be out of work for months, and precisely in the most important months"", Orban told public radio.""We are facing an election in Europe that... I believe will decide, together with the US election, the question of war and peace in Europe.""Orban, like Fico, advocates peace talks between Ukraine and Russia. Fico has previously called for Kyiv to cede territory to Moscow to end the war -- something Ukraine has repeatedly ruled out.Orban is also known for having changed laws to restrict independent media, a direction Fico has recently taken.The Slovak leader sparked protests with controversial changes including a media law that critics say will undermine the impartiality of public broadcasters.Zaborowski said the government could capitalise on public sympathy for Fico by ploughing ahead with a media clampdown.""I think the next step here will be to speed up the pacification of public media and their takeover by those close to Fico,"" he warned.""We'll also probably see attempts to make life difficult for critical media.""I think we can expect the government to rush to pass legislation on NGOs that it will use to limit their freedom.""Some government members were ""trying to strengthen the position of the ruling coalition on the wave of public anger"" analyst Grigorij Meseznikov.""They're speaking about the implementation of some measures... The tendency is to try to use and to capitalise on"" the attack, he added.""But what I see also inside the ruling coalition is that there are more responsible politicians who are speaking in a different manner.""The shooting has prompted fears of further violence in the polarised nation, although some analysts blame Fico's camp for having generated the atmosphere of hatred.""There are some politicians who used the emotion of fear in their pre-election campaign and it paid off for them,"" Koziak said. ""But now this came back like a boomerang to Smer.""","Slovak prime minister Robert Fico suffered multiple gunshot wounds on Wednesday.
