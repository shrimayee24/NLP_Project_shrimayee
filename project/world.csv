'Why is it not paying tax?': Priyank Kharge levels ‘money laundering racket’ charge against RSS,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/guru-dakshina-means-flag-priyank-kharge-levels-money-laundering-racket-charge-against-rss/articleshow/128405383.cms,"NEW DELHI: Karnataka Minister Priyank Kharge on Sunday accused the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh of indulging in “money laundering”, questioned its sources of income and asked why it was not paying taxes.Addressing a gathering at an event here, Kharge alleged financial irregularities and sought greater accountability from the organisation.""It (RSS) has a network of more than 2,500 organisations, they are from America, England. They take money from them. I am telling -- that these people are into money laundering,"" he said.Questioning the source of its funds, he added, ""they want us to be good citizens, pay income tax, but they want to remain free. How is it possible. We will have to question this.""Kharge said the same law and Constitution applicable to everyone in the country should apply to the RSS as well. Later, speaking to reporters, he pointed out that the RSS is an unregistered organisation and asked whether ""they are above law or Constitution.""""It is good that all organisations should come under the ambit of law and constitution, whether it is RSS or any other organisations. Are they above law and constitution. Mohan Bhagwat (RSS chief) says it (RSS) is a body of individuals. So is Bangalore Club, have they not registered? Are they not paying taxes?"" he further asked.Stating that his question is why the RSS was unregistered, he said, ""Where is their Guru Dakshina (donation) coming from.""Kharge said, ""If we ask about the source of RSS money, they tell us that we will get Guru Dakshina. However, when I did some research, according to them, Guru Dakshina means 'flag'. So, tomorrow morning, if I also hoist the blue flag and collect money, I will ask the government and them (RSS) whether they will agree. Thus, no one can escape baseless words. From now on, I will not give up until this RSS organisation is registered under the Constitution and the law. """"Who is paying it? Why is it (RSS) not paying tax? When every rupee of others is being accounted for, why is there no accountability for their (RSS) money,"" he asked.Kharge also took a swipe at the organisation over patriotism, saying, ""RSS did not hoist the national flag in their office for 52 years. They teach us about patriotism.""""Ramayana, written by Valmiki, is different; what is happening now is different. Politicians and religious leaders are talking about religion as they wish. No religion incites violence. RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, who says that one should have three children, is not getting married. However, he talks about raising other people's children. Thus, the BJP is constantly saying things outside and inside, and is sending the children of the poor to the streets,"" Kharge said.Meanwhile, Kharge launched a sharp attack on the demand to confer the Bharat Ratna to Veer Savarkar, asking why a person who, according to him, ""worked against Bharat"" should receive the country's highest civilian honour.In a post shared on X, Kharge posted a long list of questions targeting Savarkar's role during the freedom struggle. His attack came in response to comments made by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on February 8, at a two-day lecture series titled '100 Years of Sangh Journey - New Horizons'. Addressing questions over the delay in honouring Savarkar, Bhagwat said the award would elevate the prestige of the Bharat Ratna itself. Bhagwat further said that he was not on the decision-making committee but would raise the issue if given the chance.",Karnataka Minister Priyank Kharge accused the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh of indulging in ‘money laundering’ He also questioned its sources of income and asked why it was not paying taxes.

'Pick up the baton': Mani Shankar Aiyar's pitch for Pinarayi Vijayan sparks row; Congress draws line,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pick-up-the-baton-mani-shankar-aiyars-pitch-for-pinarayi-vijayan-sparks-row-congress-draws-line/articleshow/128406148.cms,"‘No connection whatsoever with the Congress’

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar on Sunday stoked a fresh controversy after lauding Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and expressing hope for the return of the Left government in the upcoming assembly elections.This comes as the Congress seeks a return to power in Kerala in the polls scheduled for May this year.Speaking at an international seminar titled “Vision 2031: Development and Democracy”, Aiyar asked Vijayan to “pick up the baton that the Congress has dropped.”He added that it may appear ironic that the state which has made the most commendable progress towards that goal is Kerala, ruled by a “Marxist-Leninist party”.“I do not know whether this is a compliment or an insult, but I deeply regret the absence of my party colleagues on this occasion, which is a state occasion and therefore a national occasion. While Kerala is the first state in panchayati raj in practice, it ranks only second in law,” Aiyar said.“So, in the presence of the chief minister, who I am confident will continue in office, I renew my plea — to reinforce Kerala as the best panchayati raj state in the country.State laws should be amended based on practical experience, Thomas Isaac’s insights, the five-volume report I chaired, and the note on district planning by V K Ramachandran circulated by the Planning Commission when it truly supported panchayati raj,” he added.“Therefore, I must fall at your feet, Chief Minister Vijayan, and request you to pick up the baton that the Congress has dropped. Thank you, and may Kerala prosper,” he further said.Vijayan described Aiyar’s remarks as “charismatic words” that resonated with the current context.In a social media post about the Vision 2031 International Conference, he said Aiyar’s observations reflected the contemporary scenario and reaffirmed his government’s commitment to strengthening grassroots democracy.“We stand united in the belief that democracy flourishes only when power resides with the people. We will continue to strengthen our local bodies as the heartbeat of growth,” the Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader said.Meanwhile, Aiyar’s remarks did not go down well with the Congress leadership.Congress national spokesperson Pawan Khera sought to distance the party from Aiyar’s comments, saying he has had no connection whatsoever with the Congress for the past few years.In a post on X, Khera said Aiyar “speaks and writes purely in his personal capacity”.""Mr. Mani Shankar Aiyar has had no connection whatsoever with the Congress for the past few years. He speaks and writes purely in his personal capacity,"" Khera said.Congress general secretary in-charge of communications Jairam Ramesh also rubbished Aiyar's remarks and said that the United Democratic Front (UDF) is set to return to power in Kerala.“Let there be no doubt. The people of Kerala will bring the UDF back for more responsible and responsive governance. They also know the LDF and BJP are covert partners,” he said.","Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar asked Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to “pick up the baton that the Congress has dropped” He added that it may appear ironic that the state which has made the most commendable progress towards that goal is Kerala, ruled by a “Marxist-Leninist party”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128406192,imgsize-772505,width-400,resizemode-4/former-union-minister-mani-shankar-aiyar.jpg"
"Villages in Noida in grip of child-lifting rumours; parents quit jobs, change shifts: ‘We can’t take chances’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/villages-in-noida-in-grip-of-child-lifting-rumours/articleshow/128401541.cms,"Image used for representative purpose only





NOIDA: Guddi has quit two cooking jobs so she can be home at Sarfabad early each afternoon. Her six-year-old son walks back from school, and the fear of what might happen on the way has become overwhelming.""Once children leave the school gate, the school authorities say that they are not responsible,"" she said. ""That scared many of us. We can't take chances.""Guddi's decision was driven by panic as rumours of girls going missing swirled through village pockets across Noida, with unverified claims of child lifters spreading rapidly in recent weeks. Neighbourhood conversations and social media forwards have triggered panic among parents despite repeated assurances from police and NGOs that there is no evidence to support them.The latest rumours, similar to the pre-Covid hysteria about children going missing — which led to several lynchings and WhatsApp enforcing curbs on forwards — have been triggered by a report circulating on social media in Jan about girls going missing in Delhi, police said.Senior police officers told TOI that no complaint or verified report of a child abduction had been received. “These appear to be hoaxes, possibly triggered by misleading social media messages,” an officer said, urging residents to avoid spreading unverified information.Fear has nonetheless reshaped daily routines. Several women have quit jobs, men have changed shifts, children are not being sent to school, and locals are putting up watches for child lifters. “We rush back every day to be with our children,” said another domestic staffer from Sarfabad, who works in a nearby high-rise society. “Even if this turns out to be false, the fear is real.”Several non-profits and schools reported a visible impact. Mala Bhandari, founder of a Noida-based NGO, said attendance dropped sharply in centres operating in Nagla, Tugalpur and Haldoni. “Parents stopped sending children altogether,” she said. “When our team did field visits, we found no incidents.”Another NGO temporarily shut operations after first hearing the rumour from children. “We closed for a few days because attendance dropped,” the owner said. “When we cross-checked with families, no one had seen or knew a victim. It was unverified talk, but the panic had already spread.”Primary schools in nearby villages reported similar disruptions. A teacher in Harola said attendance dropped as rumours intensified, though follow-ups revealed no abduction cases. “Some absences were also for personal reasons, like family weddings,” she said.In some schools, the response was precautionary. Sunita, a teacher at a private school in one of the villages, said the management circulated consent forms asking parents to pre-declare how children would commute and who would collect them. “Students are released only to authorised guardians,” she said. “There are no such cases here that we know of, but awareness feels necessary.”A police officer said such episodes are not new. Similar rumours have surfaced in the past, briefly fuelling fear before being debunked. The concern, they added, is that misinformation, especially when amplified online, can quickly disrupt community life and strain trust.The panic echoes 2018 and 2019, when India witnessed a spate of mob violence sparked by suspicions of child lifting, many of them triggered by viral WhatsApp messages. According to data compiled by Centre for Study of Society and Secularism, there were 41 reported incidents of mob violence in 2018 linked to such rumours, making child-lifting fears the leading trigger that year. Though National Crime Records Bureau does not maintain data for mob lynching, making comprehensive tracking difficult, at least 20 people were killed in the mob attack during the period.","Unverified claims of child lifters spreading rapidly in Noida, India.

They want to raise their issues, especially ahead of the assembly polls,"" he said.During the first part of the session, the Lok Sabha experienced disruptions from February 2 onward, following Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's disallowance by the chair from quoting excerpts from former army chief M M Naravane's unpublished memoir, which referenced the India-China conflict in 2020.On February 4, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was unable to respond to the debate on the Motion of Thanks due to protests by the opposition.In an unprecedented move, the Motion of Thanks was passed on February 5 without the customary speech from the prime minister. The Speaker read the Motion of Thanks to the president for her address, and it was passed by voice vote amid sloganeering from opposition members.Birla later stated that he received concrete information suggesting that several Congress MPs might carry out an ""unexpected act"" near the prime minister's seat, prompting him to advise Modi against attending the House for his address. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra refuted this claim.Subsequently, eight opposition members were suspended for the remainder of the Budget Session for unruly behaviour in the House.Last week, the speaker decided to step aside from his role as the presiding officer of the House, hours after the opposition submitted a motion for his removal from office, alleging that he had acted in a ""blatantly partisan"" manner.","Kiren Rijiju says debate on no-confidence motion against Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla will be taken up on March 9.

Pakistan Admits US-Backed Jihad In Afghan Wars A Mistake, But Still Accuses India Of Proxy War

NEW DELHI: India must continue to expose Pakistan’s nexus with terrorist groups and its tendency to pursue a proxy war against neighbouring countries as Islamabad has long evaded accountability due to the apathy of the international community, a latest report in a US-based independent journal has said.“Simultaneously, India needs to enhance its anti-terrorism apparatus to effectively tackle the scourge of Pakistan sponsored terrorism single-handedly and in addition to military retribution, also consider non-kinetic measures that impose a prohibitive cost on Islamabad,” said the report in Eurasia Review.Writing for Eurasia Review, former army officer Nilesh Kunwar said, “While its designation may sound impressive, the UN Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team of the Security Council’s 1267 Sanctions Committee is unfortunately just a ‘paper tiger’ that bases its reports on feedback from member states without investigating the same or giving any directions. Its recently released 37th report has linked Pakistan based proscribed terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad to the April 22, 2025, Pahalgam attack, the Nov 9, 2025, Red Fort suicide car bombing, as well as its formal announcement of a women-only wing named Jamaat-ul-Muminat created for waging global jihad. However, by qualifying that these incidents or developments were what a member state (implying India) had noted, the UN report has characteristically not endorsed its own observations on the same.”It further said, “While there’s no doubt that the UN Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team lacks ‘teeth’ and doesn’t act as an effective deterrent, yet, this report does provide diplomatic leverage. In the instant case, India definitely has an advantage since unlike Islamabad’s palpably false claim of JeM being “defunct,” which is a feeble defence -- New Delhi’s assertions on JeM’s activities are corroborated by irrefutable hard evidence,” it said.The attempt of DG ISPR (media wing of Pakistan armed forces) to deny JeM chief’s presence in the country was laughable because just a few days earlier, Pakistan’s then foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had not only confirmed Masood Azhar’s presence in Pakistan but even given his health update by saying, “He is very unwell… to the extent that he cannot leave his house,” the report said.There is definitely a need for India to be more proactive and expose Pakistan’s ongoing use of terrorism as an instrument of foreign policy more forcefully by following the ‘name and shame’ policy, it said.",India must continue to expose Pakistan’s nexus with terrorist groups.

UN Flags Jaish-e-Mohammed Role In Delhi Red Fort Attack Raises Alarm Over Masood Azhar's Women Wing

NEW DELHI: The “white-collar” terror module recently uncovered by J&K Police, in which several doctors were arrested, revealed that after being radicalised in 2016 they formed a new terror outfit called “Ansar Interim” to carry out subversive activities in the Union Territory and beyond, officials said on Sunday.The case is now being investigated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).The inter-state terror network first came to light after JeM posters appeared on walls in Bunpora, Nowgam, on the outskirts of Srinagar, on October 19. Srinagar police registered a case and analysed CCTV footage, leading to the arrest of three locals — Arif Nisar Dar alias Sahil, Yasir-ul-Ashraf, and Maqsood Ahmad Dar alias Shahid — all of whom had prior stone-pelting cases, reported PTI.Their interrogation led to the arrest of Maulvi Irfan Ahmad, a former paramedic turned Imam from Shopian, who allegedly supplied the posters and used his access to radicalise the doctors.Investigators later found that the accused doctors — Muzamil Gannie, Umer-un-Nabi (now dead), and Adeel Rather — along with his brother Muzzafar Rather (absconding), Maulvi Irfan, Qari Aamir, and Tufail Gazi had met at Eidgah in downtown Srinagar in April 2022.During this meeting, they decided to form the terror organisation “Ansar Interim,” naming Adeel as the ‘Ameer’ (chief), Maulvi Irfan as ‘Deputy Ameer,’ and Gannie as treasurer.Officials noted that among militant groups, “Ansar” is commonly associated with the globally banned terror outfit Al-Qaeda.The arrested doctors and preachers told interrogators that they formed a new group after losing contact with active terrorists. Roles and operational codes were assigned, with Umer taking charge as coordinator and, along with Gannie, handling finances and procurement.In 2023, the group began acquiring materials, including fertiliser from Sohna and Nuh in Haryana. On Umer’s instructions, NPK — commonly known as Potassium Nitrate in this context — was also purchased from a chemical shop in Faridabad.During interrogation, the arrested doctors said Umer watched online videos to learn rudimentary Improvised Explosive Device (IED) construction and managed to prepare Triacetone Triperoxide (TATP), a peroxide explosive used in several terrorist attacks as the filling for IEDs, as reported by PTI.Officials said Adeel began recruiting members and brought in an individual named Danish, alias Jasir, from South Kashmir. Adeel took him to a rented accommodation within Al-Falah University in Faridabad, where both saw Umer and Gannie preparing TATP explosive materials.Umer later tried to persuade Danish to carry out a ‘fidayeen’ (suicide) attack, but he backed out at the last minute, citing his poor economic condition and the belief that suicide was forbidden in Islam.Umer, a 28-year-old doctor from Pulwama, is believed to have been the most radicalised member and key operative in a network spanning Kashmir, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. Officials suspect he had been planning a powerful Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED) blast, intending to place it in a crowded location in the national capital or at a site of religious importance and then flee.However, the plot collapsed after Srinagar police arrested Gannie and seized explosives, prompting Umer to panic and leading to the premature blast outside the Red Fort on November 10, which killed over a dozen people. Investigators also found that Umer had earlier tried unsuccessfully to join terror groups in 2016 and 2018.","The inter-state terror network first came to light after JeM posters appeared on walls in Bunpora, Nowgam, on the outskirts of Srinagar.

NEW DELHI: At least nine people were injured on Sunday after a confrontation broke out between BJP and Congress workers in Pune during a protest over remarks made by Congress leader Harshwardhan Sapkal that allegedly equated Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj with Tipu Sultan.The clash took place outside the Congress Bhavan, where BJP workers had gathered to protest against Sapkal’s comments. The situation escalated into sloganeering and stone pelting from both sides, leading to minor injuries.Joint Commissioner of Police Ranjan Kumar Sharma said that three Congress workers, two BJP workers, two police personnel and two journalists were injured in the incident.""A protest was held near the Congress Bhavan, which saw sloganeering from workers of BJP and Congress. Workers of both parties climbed onto walls and there was stone pelting from both sides. Cases are being registered against workers of both sides,"" Sharma informed.Police deployed heavy security in the area to prevent further escalation.The controversy stems from Maharashtra Congress chief Harshwardhan Sapkal’s recent remarks, in which he referred to the valour of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and cited Tipu Sultan’s resistance against the British as being on similar lines.The comments triggered political backlash in the state.Speaking to reporters, Sapkal said: ""The kind of bravery that Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj possessed and the concept of 'Swarajya' (self-rule) that he introduced... much later, following in that very tradition and taking inspiration from his ideals, Tipu Sultan waged war against the British.""""In that sense, Tipu Sultan was a great warrior who displayed immense bravery and was a true son of India. He never allowed any poisonous or communal ideas to sway him. As a symbol of bravery, we should view Tipu Sultan as equivalent to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj,"" he added.A day earlier, a separate row had erupted over a portrait of Tipu Sultan displayed in the office of the deputy mayor of the Malegaon Municipal Corporation, which was opposed by Shiv Sena corporators and Hindu outfits.Pune city Congress chief Arvind Shinde said that the party has submitted a written complaint against BJP functionaries and demanded action.He said a case should be registered against Mayor Manjusha Nagpure, BJP city president Dheeraj Ghate, Dushyant Mohol and other workers.Speaking to PTI, Maharashtra Congress vice-president Mohan Joshi alleged that BJP workers initiated the violence.""During the protest, stones were pelted at Congress workers and two sustained injuries. We are currently holding a sit-in protest outside the police station in Shivajinagar seeking action,"" he said.Krishikesh Rawale, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone 1), said that police intervened promptly to prevent the situation from worsening.Meanwhile, BJP Pune city unit president Dheeraj Ghate lodged a complaint against Sapkal at Parvati police station for allegedly hurting Hindu sentiments. A FIR has been registered.The political exchange intensified as Maharashtra Congress leader Sachin Sawant accused the BJP of “double standards” and pursuing a polarisation agenda.In a statement, Sawant cited past instances where BJP leaders had supported references to 18th-century Mysuru ruler Tipu Sultan in public spaces and official forums. He referred to resolutions passed in civic bodies in Akola and Mumbai and alleged that BJP leaders had earlier praised or associated with the historical figure.""What should this hypocrisy be called? Tipu Sultan used to wear a ring bearing the name of Lord Ram,"" he claimed.Sawant alleged that the BJP was now portraying Tipu Sultan negatively to create religious divisions and engage in “distorted religious politics”.He further cited examples, including a 2012 resolution in the Akola Municipal Corporation to name a hall after Tipu Sultan, a 2013 proposal supported by BJP corporators to name a road in Mumbai, and a 2001 road naming in Andheri (West).He also claimed that former Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa had visited Tipu Sultan’s tomb and written words of praise and that then President Ram Nath Kovind had praised Tipu Sultan in the Karnataka Assembly in 2017.","Clash took place outside the Congress Bhavan, where BJP workers had gathered.

However, there was never any question of the PM travelling as the date and even the time of the swearing-in was clashing with his bilateral meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in Mumbai that was scheduled weeks in advance.The foreign ministry said Birla’s participation at this “important event” underscored the deep and enduring friendship between the peoples of India and Bangladesh, reaffirming India’s steadfast commitment to the democratic values that bind the two nations.“As neighbours united by a shared history, culture, and mutual respect, India welcomes Bangladesh’s transition to an elected govt under the leadership of Tarique Rahman, whose vision and values have received an overwhelming mandate of the people,” MEA said in a statement.Modi was among the first global leaders to congratulate Rahman on X on Friday morning, shortly after it became evident the BNP leader was going to form the new govt with absolute majority. Modi said the results reflected the trust that the Bangladesh people had in Rahman’s leadership. Later in the day, he also became the first foreign leader to speak to Rahman and offer cooperation with him in his efforts to fulfil the aspirations of the people of Bangladesh.Importantly for India, BNP responded positively to Modi’s messages as it said Bangladesh remained committed to upholding democratic values, inclusivity, and progressive development for all its citizens.“We look forward to engaging constructively with India to advance our multifaceted relationship, guided by mutual respect, sensitivity to each other’s concerns, and a shared commitment to peace, stability, and prosperity in our region,” said the party.","Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla will represent India at swearing-in ceremony of the newly elected govt of Bangladesh led by Tarique Rahman.

Amit Shah’s 'Tamil Apology' In Focus As Stalin Speaks Tamil Without Apology In Bihar

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Karti Chidambaram on Sunday dismissed allegations that Tamil Nadu is “hostile” to Sanatan Dharma, contending instead that people in the state are “more Hindu than North Indians.”The BJP has frequently accused the Congress, its ally the ruling DMK in Tamil Nadu, and their other INDIA bloc partners of being “anti-Sanatan Dharma.” The political attack stems from controversial past remarks by Udhayanidhi Stalin , son of Tamil Nadu chief minister and DMK supremo MK Stalin. Udhyanidhi now serves as the state's deputy chief minister.“What is Sanatan? That is not a term anyone in Tamil Nadu uses… We are more Hindu than North Indians. Per square kilometre, we have more temples. We break more coconuts every day. I personally visit more temples than many people in the BJP combined,” Chidambaram told ANI.“There isn’t a single day that I step out of my house without applying vibhuti or kundalama. ‘Sanatan Dharma’ is not a phrase we use,” he added.Addressing the controversy sparked in 2023 by remarks from Udhayanidhi Stalin, the Sivaganga MP attributed the uproar to “differing interpretations” of the term.“This issue became controversial because Udhayanidhi Stalin made a comment about the term. In Tamil Nadu, it is understood to refer to caste hierarchy—that’s how it is commonly interpreted here. He was speaking about caste hierarchy, not about the practice of the Hindu faith,” Chidambaram stated.In 2023, Udhayanidhi had likened “Sanatana” to diseases such as malaria and dengue, saying it should be “eradicated” rather than merely opposed, triggering a nationwide political debate.He had remarked, “Sanatana is like malaria and dengue, and therefore it must be eradicated, not just opposed. I thank the organisers for naming this event the ‘Sanatana Abolition Conference’ instead of the ‘Anti-Sanatana Conference.’ Some things cannot simply be opposed; they must be abolished. We don’t oppose dengue, mosquitoes, malaria, or corona—we eradicate them. In the same way, Sanatana should be eradicated rather than opposed. ”Tamil Nadu is set to hold assembly elections in April. Although the Congress is an ally of the DMK, it is not part of the state government, in line with the prevailing political practice in the southern state.","The BJP has frequently accused the Congress, its ally the ruling DMK in Tamil Nadu, and their other INDIA bloc partners of being “anti-Sanatan Dharma” The political attack stems from controversial past remarks by Udhayanidhi Stalin, son of Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128386798,imgsize-21302,width-400,resizemode-4/karti-chidambaram.jpg"

Kiren Rijiju Explains Why Modi Govt Paused Privilege Notice Against Rahul Gandhi After Dubey's Move

NEW DELHI: Union parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday said that the debate and voting on the no-confidence motion against Lok Sabha Speaker will be taken up on March 9.""On March 9 in the Lok Sabha, we will have the debate on the no-confidence motion moved against the speaker,"" Rijiju told news agency PTI.""It is the rule to take it up on the first day. There will be a vote following the debate,"" he added.Additionally, a speedy review will be conducted as per the rules, news agency ANI reported citing sources.This comes after Congress MPs submitted a no-confidence motion against the Om Birla , signed by 118 MPs. The Opposition MPs alleged ""blatantly partisan"" conduct and that leaders of opposition parties were not allowed to speak.However, this is not the first time when a no-confidence against Chair has been moved by the opposition. Earlier in 2024, the opposition moved a similar motion against then Rajya Sabha Chairman and Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar.History also records at least three instances since Independence when a no-confidence motion was moved to remove the Speaker. The first was against the first Lok Sabha Speaker, GV Mavalankar, in 1954, after MP Vigneshwar Misra alleged that the Speaker was not impartial.In 1966, opposition MPs moved a motion against Speaker Sardar Hukum Singh, with Madhu Limaye leading the charge and Deputy Speaker S V Krishnamoorthy Rao in the Chair.The third motion was moved on April 15, 1987, for the removal of Speaker Balram Jakhar by CPM MP Somnath Chatterjee, with Deputy Speaker Thambi Durai presiding. This motion was axed by the House.What was Nehru's message to Congress MPs when oppn move a no-confidence motion against Speaker GV MavalankarThe first such situation surfaced on December 18, 1954, when the Opposition moved a resolution for the removal of then Speaker Mavalankar. It was admitted after over 50 members stood up in support, and a debate took place over it.India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru 's message to Congress MPs during the debate in 1954 on the Opposition's resolution to remove then Speaker GV Mavalankar was that they are not bound by any whip or direction, and that all legislators must consider the matter ""regardless of party affiliations"".He had urged Lok Sabha MPs to look at the issue not through the lens of the party but as a matter concerning the dignity of the House.It was a fiery debate during which the Opposition, though weak in numbers, tore into Nehru and accused the speaker of being partisan.Intervening in the debate, Nehru said, ""I would like to address the House, if I may, in my capacity and the high privilege of being the Leader of this House and not as a leader of the majority party. So far as this majority party is concerned, I would like to tell them that not one of them is bound by any whip or any direction: let them vote as they like. It is not a party matter. It is a matter for this House, for each individual, to consider, regardless of party affiliations. """"Therefore, let us try to think of it not as a party issue but as members of this House, because this matter affects the hon. speaker, of course, but it affects the high dignity of this House as Parliament, it affects the first citizen of this country, that is, the speaker of this House,"" he added.What is said about the speaker, what is done about the speaker comes back on each one of us who claim to be members of this House, the then PM said.""I wish members to realise this because I have felt sad and very sad ever since this matter came up before the House. We have known the speaker for many years and we have seen him function and it is possible that some of us may not have exactly the same opinion about him as others have; it is possible,"" he said.""It has so happened that some of us have not particularly liked a decision of his or a ruling of his. It is one thing not to like a ruling or to disagree with it or even to feel, if I may say so, slightly irritated about something that has happened. These things happen. But, it is completely a different thing to challenge the bona fides of the very person in whose keeping is the honour of this House,"" Nehru had said.""I do not say that it is not possible at all to raise a motion against the Speaker. Of course, the Constitution has provided it. Nobody challenges the right of the Opposition or any Member of the House to put forward this motion. I do not deny that right since it has been given by the Constitution. The point is not the legal right but the propriety; the desirability of doing it,"" he said.Nehru then went on to strongly defend the speaker and hit out at the Opposition for questioning his bona fides.The Congress had a brute majority with over 360 members, and the resolution was negated by a voice vote.","Congress MPs submitted a no-confidence motion against the Om Birla. Opposition MPs alleged ""blatantly partisan"" conduct and that leaders of opposition parties were not allowed to speak. Jawaharlal Nehru had urged Lok Sabha MPs to look at issue not through the lens of the party but as a matter concerning the dignity of the House.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128383618,imgsize-1320718,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

""While talking to reporters, Tagore reiterated that Congress is in alliance with DMK and a committee, for seat sharing talks, will be formed on the 22nd February.""We are not like other parties that switch directions after merely putting on an indicator and turning right. We are a national party with principles. We are in an alliance with the DMK as part of the INDIA bloc,"" Tagore said.""It has been 70 days since we were told that a committee would be formed for talks, and we are still waiting. They have now said that the committee will be formed on the 22nd February.

However, days earlier, Stalin ruled out the possibility of sharing power with allies.Tagore’s remarks came in response to comments made by DMK leader and state minister RS Raja Kannappan in Madurai on February 13, where he asserted that the DMK would contest 170 constituencies and win 160 seats in the upcoming election.Reacting to the statement, Tagore, the MP from Virudhunagar, said in a post on X: “In 2021, you contested in 173 seats and secured 133. What we are asking (now) are the seats which you failed to win.”He further underlined the Congress’s position on governance, saying, “Power sharing is necessary. The share in power is our right. The people will decide,” while sharing a video clip of Raja Kannappan’s speech.In the video, Raja Kannappan ruled out the possibility of a coalition government, expressing confidence that the DMK would independently secure 160 seats.Days earlier, CM Stalin strongly ruled out sharing power with allies, while maintaining that the alliance with the Congress remained “intact” and free of confusion.“We also know that it will not work in Tamil Nadu; they (Congress) know it too. It is a problem created by some people. They are deliberately conspiring to see if there will be a rift in the alliance. We are not worried about it.

""What should this hypocrisy be called?

Responding to queries on the treasury benches considering a privilege notice against him over his recent speech on the Budget, the LoP said media should not merely repeat what it is told.Condemning the remarks, National Union of Journalists and Delhi Journalists Association issued a joint statement calling Gandhi’s comments inappropriate. “The LoP targeting and insulting media personnel in such a manner is highly condemnable,” NUJ president Ras Bihar said.

Extortion threats are prompting families in Peel Region to leave Canada as the police departments are still trying to get a better handle on these cases as they cross provincial and international borders, Toronto City News reported.Dharmjit, an Indian-origin man, who became the target of the extortion gang late last year, said the police do not have enough resources to fight the criminals. Dharmjit said he started receiving extortion calls in October 2025. He informed the police blocked all the numbers. But the extortion calls never stopped coming. And then there was a firing at his farm on November 25. Dharmjit said the cops advised them to stay away from that residence. They did that. But when they returned, the gunfire too returned.“So if the police cannot protect you, the police have nothing to protect you. So what do you do? They say, leave from your house, leave your house. Where do you go? Why do you want to buy another house in the same area or the same country? Better leave the country,” Dharmjit said.“They start in October, calling me about money. Then I informed the police. So I blocked the number, then they started calling from another number, and I blocked this number.Then they come on November 25th at my farm, they shoot, at night,” he said.Extortion targeting Indians has become a normal thing in Canada, with local government calling on the federal government for help in fighting this organized crime.

Delhi: Man Arrested For Valentine’s Strangling, SI Duped of ₹17 L, Early Winters Exit & More





NEW DELHI: A man identified as Sahil Solanki was shot dead in Delhi’s Rohini area on Saturday night, with police suspecting gang rivalry behind the killing. Sahil, who had recently been released from jail, was allegedly associated with the notorious Gogi gang.The rival Tillu gang is suspected to be behind the murder. The two gangs are known to be sworn enemies. Following the incident, fear has gripped the locality. Police said the investigation is underway and the accused are absconding.Preeti, a local resident, said, “The continuous criminal incidents in Delhi over the past several days are proof that the nation's capital is now becoming a crime capital, where incidents like murder, robbery, theft, and shooting have become commonplace. The latest incident occurred in the Cartoon police station area of Rohini district. This incident is from Rohini Sector 17, where a young man was shot dead in broad daylight on Saturday night. The deceased has been identified as Sahil Solanki, who lived with his family in Rohini Sector 17.”According to police, Sahil was shot in the head and other parts of the body. The attackers reportedly arrived on a motorcycle, opened fire and fled the spot.Police teams, including the crime and forensic units, reached the scene and recovered multiple empty cartridges. Statements of local witnesses have also been recorded.District Additional DCP Rajiv Ranjan said over the phone that Sahil had been released from jail a few days ago and had a criminal background. Police said no previous murder case had been registered against him, though three other cases were confirmed.Police sources claimed the deceased was known as ‘Durga’ and was linked to the Gogi gang in the Delhi-NCR region, though this has not been officially confirmed. A knife was reportedly recovered from his right hand at the scene. All evidence has been seized and preserved, and the body has been kept at Ambedkar Hospital in Rohini for post-mortem.The family members of the deceased are inconsolable, while residents in the area have expressed fear and concern following the brazen killing. Police have registered a case of murder and are scanning CCTV footage from nearby areas. Technical surveillance and local intelligence inputs are also being used to trace the attackers.","A man identified as Sahil Solanki was shot dead in Delhi’s Rohini area on Saturday night.

NOIDA: A 32-year-old man and a 28-year-old woman were found dead with gunshot wounds inside a locked car in Sector 107 on Saturday afternoon. Police are investigating the twin deaths as murder-suicide, based on a message in the man's phone that indicated he had killed his ex-girlfriend before turning the gun on himself.The two were identified as Rekha, a resident of Salarpur in Noida, and Sumit Kumar, a resident of Trilokpuri in Delhi. Rekha worked in a private company in Sector 62, while Sumit had a mineral water plant business.The deaths were discovered around 1pm on Saturday when locals found a suspiciously parked car near Dadri Road, close to pillar no 84, police said. The vehicle had been stationary for a long time. Passersby found a man, with a gun in his hand, and a woman, bleeding and unconscious in their seats, after which they alerted the police.A team from the Sector 39 police station broke open a window and discovered both dead from head gunshot wounds. They recovered a pistol, two spent cartridges, and confirmed the weapon was illegal.Separately, police are also looking at a message purportedly typed by Sumit on WhatsApp at 3.39pm on Friday. In the message, Sumit wrote that the two had been in a relationship for 15 years and had plans to get married.However, he wrote, Rekha recently decided to marry someone else, which prompted him to take the extreme step.It was not immediately clear if he sent the message to anyone or saved it for himself.Rekha's family, meanwhile, claimed Sumit had been harassing her and a complaint was filed in the past. The matter was later resolved after he apologised and assured that he would not trouble her again, the family alleged. Rekha's brother said the couple's relationship had become strained in recent months as her family was arranging her marriage elsewhere because they belonged to different castes.Both families had filed missing person complaints on Friday – Rekha's at Sector 58 police station in Noida and Sumit's in Delhi.Investigators said it was likely the two planned the meeting in advance. Police are scanning CCTV footage from over 50 cameras in the area to determine when Rekha left her office and where she met Sumit. According to police sources, Rekha's family said she usually returned home by 7pm. When she did not on Friday, they approached a local police outpost later in the night. Her phone remained off through Friday but was switched on around 7am on Saturday. Calls to it went unanswered.This indicates one or both was alive at the time and the shootings happened later in the morning on Saturday.Sumit's brother Sachin questioned the circumstance of their deaths and said the spot where the car was found was less than a kilometre from Rekha's house. He demanded a thorough investigation to rule out foul play.Additional deputy commissioner of police Manisha Singh told reporters, ""Forensic teams were called to the spot. Blood samples, the weapon, and other material evidence were collected. Ballistic examination of the pistol will help determine the sequence of firing, the distance from which the shots were fired, and other crucial details,"" she said.Officials said mobile phone data of both the deceased will be examined to reconstruct their movements and conversations prior to the incident. This is important because it will determine whether they spent the entire time in the car since they met on Friday evening, went somewhere or met someone.","Man, 32, and woman, 28, found dead in locked car in Noida on Saturday afternoon.

LUCKNOW: In a glaring example of medical negligence and quackery, the Ambedkar Nagar police on Friday arrested a class 12 student and an Arts graduate for allegedly conducting a caesarean surgery at an unregistered private hospital, resulting in the death of a woman during childbirth. Probe revealed the illegal hospital had been running for five years.The accused were identified as Yogesh Verma (32), a BA graduate from Malipur, and Shubham Vishwakarma (19), an intermediate student from Sultanpur. The duo allegedly performed surgeries at Navjeevan Hospital in Baskhari without possessing any recognised medical degree or surgical qualification.The deceased, Priyanka, was admitted to the hospital on February 5 for delivery.According to police, the duo conducted a caesarean section, after which she delivered a baby girl. However, Priyanka allegedly suffered excessive bleeding and never regained consciousness following the administration of anaesthesia. As her condition deteriorated, she was referred to Lucknow, but she died.The incident triggered protests by the victim's family, after which the hospital operator, identified as Ruby, fled the spot and remains absconding.The police seized mobile phones linked to the case and launched efforts to trace her.Baskhari SHO Sunil Kumar Pandey, who is leading the investigation, said that two so-called ""doctors"" were called in to conduct the surgery. ""Yogesh Verma is only a graduate. His father worked as a ward boy at CHC Jalalpur, and he learned basic medical procedures while assisting him. He reportedly performed surgeries for several years,"" the SHO said.The second accused, Shubham Vishwakarma, is associated with Bajrang Nursing Home in Belwai under Akhandnagar police station limits of Sultanpur district.During questioning, he told police that he gained experience by observing procedures at a local hospital after completing his class 12. Both the accused allegedly arrived on call to conduct surgeries at Navjeevan Hospital, which had been operating for nearly 5 years.Police sources revealed that the duo allegedly charged between Rs 3,000 and Rs 5,000 per caesarean operation—significantly lower than qualified surgeons—attracting poor patients seeking affordable treatment.Following directions from the Chief Medical Officer, a joint inspection was conducted on the night of February 8 by the CHC superintendent, sub-divisional magistrate Tanda, and Baskhari police. During the inspection, officials found that the hospital operated illegally from four rooms of a residential building without any registration certificate, biomedical waste (BMW) authorisation, fire NOC, or required medical staff as per norms.""No signboard displaying hospital registration details was found on the premises. Various medicines, surgical and medical equipment were recovered from the site. After preparing an inventory, authorities sealed all the four rooms in the presence of the SDM and police,"" said Dr Ajay Kumar, CHC superintendent.An FIR was lodged on February 9 on the complaint of the CHC superintendent under relevant sections for the illegal operation of a hospital and medical negligence. Police said further investigation is on to identify other hospitals where the accused may have performed surgeries.Authorities also ordered verification of all medical credentials linked to the hospital and warned of strict action against illegal healthcare establishments operating in the district.Police said that Priyanka's husband Sandeep lodged another FIR under the charges of BNS 105 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), and efforts are on to catch Ruby.","Police arrest a class 12 student and an Arts graduate for allegedly conducting a caesarean surgery at an unregistered private hospital, resulting in the death of a woman during childbirth.

NEW DELHI: The occultist, Kamruddin—arrested for allegedly killing three people near Peeragarhi—had started influencing five others through ritual claims and collecting money from them, said police.

A keypad phone has already been recovered from him, they said.Investigators also took Kamruddin to Loni and Peeragarhi to recreate the sequence of events, as these were the routes used by the accused and the victims on the day of the killings.""He was taken to the house where he ran his fake practices, then to the spot from where CCTV footage emerged and finally to Peeragarhi,"" a source said.A senior police officer said the accused initially ran a bangle business but later shifted to occult practices after seeing the possibility of earning more.

Fadnavis said the comparison was ""unacceptable"" and the Congress politician should be ""ashamed"".The controversy began after Shiv Sena corporators in Malegaon objected to the display of Tipu Sultan's portrait in the office of deputy mayor Shaan-e-Hind Nihal Ahmed. A delegation met Malegaon municipal commissioner Ravindra Jadhav, demanding that it be removed and warning of an agitation if the administration failed to act. The Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC) on Saturday removed a portrait of Tipu Sultan from the office.Jadhav confirmed that the administration examined the state govt's official protocol list, which outlines leaders whose anniversaries are observed and whose portraits are permitted for display in govt offices, before taking the action.""Tipu Sultan's name is not included in the protocol list. Therefore, the portrait was removed from the deputy mayor's office,"" MMC officials said.Malegaon deputy mayor Shaan-e-Hind Nihal Ahmed, on Friday and again on Saturday, said she received the Tipu Sultan portrait from some visitors and had no objection to it being put up in her office. ""Tipu Sultan fought against the British and was acknowledged for his bravery at that time. There are roads named after him in Mumbai and Nagpur. This is an attempt to divert attention from our work. Some people are unable to digest that two Muslim women are mayor and deputy mayor in Malegaon,"" she told reporters in Malegaon.When asked about the controversy, Sapkal, speaking in Buldhana on Saturday, said ""He (Tipu Sultan) waged a war against the British and was a brave warrior. He was a son of the soil. He never entertained poisonous or divisive thoughts. We should view Tipu Sultan as an equal to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as a symbol of bravery,"" he said.Fadnavis called the comparison unacceptable. Congress ""should be ashamed of equating the founder of Hindavi Swarajya with Tipu Sultan, who butchered 1,000s of Hindus,"" he said. ""Maharashtra will not tolerate this. If there is even a little integrity left in Congress politicians, they must clarify their stand. Their allies should also make their position clear,"" he said, referring to Shiv Sena (UBT) and NCP (SP) in the Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance.Fadnavis also objected to what he described as attempts to recast historical narratives. ""History must be taught properly. The new narrative that is being written, which we condemn in the strongest words,"" he said.The remarks drew support from Chandrashekhar Bawankule, who termed the comparison ""extremely outrageous and an attack on Maharashtra's identity"". He called it ""an insult to the legendary Maratha warrior and a betrayal of history.""Later on Saturday evening, in a post on X, Sapkal said the valour of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is unparalleled, while Tipu Sultan was valiant and a lover of Swarajya. ""It was by taking Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as an ideal that he (Tipu Sultan) fought against the British,"" Sapkal said in the post.He further hit out by claiming those following the ideology of the Sangh-BJP were slaves and spies of the British while Tipu Sultan was fighting the foreign rulers.""Therefore, Devendra Fadnavis should not get into the pretence of teaching us history. The people of Maharashtra have not forgotten what all BJP-RSS, (former governor) Bhagatsingh Koshyari, along with others, spewed against Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, and how they disrespected him,"" Sapkal said.Posting an image, the Maharashtra Congress chief said, ""These are the pictures of both Shivaji Maharaj and Tipu Sultan on the original copy of the Constitution.""(with inputs from PTI)","The controversy began after Shiv Sena corporators in Malegaon objected to the display of Tipu Sultan's portrait in the office of deputy mayor Shaan-e-Hind Nihal Ahmed.

Their stated objective was to prevent public displays of affection and discourage what they described as ‘immoral’ behaviour.As right-wingers prowled public spaces, some selfstyled activists were heard raising provocative slogans, including “ Jahan milenge Bunty-Babli, tod denge haddi pasli” (Wherever we meet Bunty-Babli, we will break their bones and ribs).The outfit framed its actions as moral policing, a practice repeated in previous years on Feb 14.“We had made it clear that there should not be any indecent or immoral conduct by couples.

Youth Congress leaders described the campaign as a pushback against “moral vigilantism.” “Our initiative was aimed at spreading love over hatred, foster brotherhood instead of discrimination, and unite society rather than divide it,” Youth Congress district president Amit Khatri said.In the city, many couples avoided public venues. Reports as well social media posts suggested that parks, eateries, and other popular rendezvous points were quieter than usual on Valentine’s Day, with couples preferring the privacy of homes over public meetings to avoid potential confrontation.Police were deployed in big numbers on the streets to prevent escalation.

BHOPAL: A 21-year-old, who has been booked for the rape of a minor in the past, was stalking and harassing a 22-year-old girl for nearly 8 months. He was arrested on Saturday.The accused allegedly barged into the woman's home and shared her photographs on a social media platform in a desperate attempt to stop the woman's wedding. He also issued death threats to the girl's brothers.Police said the girl met the accused around 7-8 months ago. During their initial acquaintance, he reportedly captured several photographs of the woman.However, as his criminal nature became apparent, the woman attempted to distance herself. The boy responded with intimidation, even visiting her house to threaten her brothers' lives, which led the woman to completely sever all communication with him.The harassment escalated to a dangerous level once the accused learned that the woman's family finalised her marriage to another man. On the night of Feb 13, just days before the wedding, he forcibly entered the survivor's home. He confronted her brother, aggressively asserting that he would not permit the marriage to proceed.When the family resisted, the accused brutally assaulted the brother, hurled abuses, and issued death threats before fleeing the scene.Later on Saturday, Meena used his Instagram account to upload and circulate the woman's photographs, aiming to tarnish her reputation and break the engagement. Eintkhedi SHO Ashish Sapre revealed that the accused is a seasoned criminal with four prior cases on his record, including the rape of a minor.Following a strategic raid, the police nabbed the accused in the Eintkhedi township. He was charged under the Information Technology (IT) Act, the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, and multiple sections of the BNS for assault and criminal intimidation.

Mumbai: Metro Collapse Crackdown, Cheating Case, Demolition Drive & More





MUMBAI: Sahar police arrested two cab drivers for allegedly cheating a Wadala couple of 1,000 Thai baht (about Rs 3,300) after they landed at Mumbai International Airport from Thailand on Feb 8 and hired a cab to go home.The accused, Imtiyaz Ahmad (34) and Riyasat Ali Khan (48), were arrested after an FIR was registered the next day. Police said they are checking how many other passengers may have been similarly duped.According to police, the couple -- Darshan Sawant (29), a fitness trainer, and his wife Monica -- was approached outside the terminal by a man who offered a cab to Wadala Fire Station in Antop Hill and quoted Rs 550, later agreeing to Rs 400. Khan allegedly made the couple sit in a taxi driven by Ahmad and rode along.After the taxi moved a short distance, he asked the driver to stop and demanded Rs 400 immediately, claiming he had to maintain accounts for multiple cars.The complainant, Darshan Sawant (29), said they did not have Indian currency and offered to pay via Google Pay, but Khan insisted on cash. When the couple said they had Thai currency, Khan allegedly said it would do and asked for 200 Thai baht, promising to return Rs 200.Police said Sawant's wife had 1,100 Thai baht in hand, but Khan took the money and, in a quick gesture, allegedly pocketed 1,000 Thai baht, paid the driver Rs 400, and left.After reaching home, the couple noticed the missing currency and filed a complaint the next day. Police said the taxis were seized, and an application has been made to the RTO to cancel the drivers' licences and permits.Last month, two other cab drivers were arrested for allegedly taking $200 from a US national for a 400-metre ride; police also initiated permit and licence cancellations in that case.","Two cab drivers arrested for allegedly cheating a couple of 1,000 Thai baht (about Rs 3,300) The couple landed at Mumbai International Airport from Thailand on Feb 8 and hired a cab to go home.

KOLKATA: CM Mamata Banerjee on Saturday invoked Rabindranath Tagore 's ‘Ananta Prem' (Unending Love) to pen a love-for-the-people Happy Valentine's Day message on X, her first since her debut on the social platform in May 2014.Banerjee's ""May love live long"" post comes against the backdrop of several right-wing groups publicly opposing — and even threatening — those celebrating the day.Quoting Tagore's original 1890 Bengali verses, the CM wrote: ""I seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times. In life after life, age after age, forever."" She added: ""Valentine's Day is a celebration of love in all its forms and manifestations, in its widest and noblest sense; love that transcends caste, creed, class and religion. It is this spirit of love that has guided my journey in public service. A love for the people strong enough to withstand storms, patient enough to listen, and bold enough to fight for justice and dignity. Happy Valentine's Day!"" She concluded by saying, ""May love live long.""The post clocked 3,58,000 views in two hours. TMC seniors linked the message to a counter-narrative against the ""politics of hate"" that the CM has frequently criticised.Bengal BJP president Samik Bhattacharya was cautious in his response. ""I cannot comment on what others have said. But we will replace swords with pens and bombs with books. Look at the number of Muslims who were killed in West Bengal. Compare that with Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh or Gujarat.""However, CPM state secretary Md Salim said: ""We fail to understand whom she was addressing — the people or the country. After so much bloodbath, terror, killings and rapes, someone is thinking of returning to the fold of love and affection. Even if the feeling is belated, it is welcome.""‘Ananta Prem' is not only a Bengali favorite but is cherished worldwide. Several writers have noted that its English translation was among Audrey Hepburn's favorites. It is said that Hepburn loved the poem so much that during her funeral in 1993, her ‘Roman Holiday' co-star Gregory Peck recited these English verses.The closest reference in the past to Banerjee broaching this issue was during a Lok Sabha rally in Diamond Harbour ahead of the 2019 polls. At that time, the CM lashed out against ""anti-Romeo squads"" in BJP-governed states, particularly Uttar Pradesh. She dubbed it ""dangerous"".TMC, in a one-minute video on X, highlighted Banerjee's affection across all age groups in Bengal and stressed that love was not always about roses but also about standing by people during hard times and in grief, which the CM always did.",West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee invoked Rabindranath Tagore's ‘Ananta Prem' (Unending Love) to pen a love-for-the-people Happy Valentine's Day message on X.

Claims And Counter-Claims After Protest Escalates

Police Register Two FIRs, Invoke Assault Charges

(With agency inputs)





NEW DELHI: A woman YouTuber alleged on Saturday that she was assaulted and that an attempt was made to forcibly take her away during a protest at Delhi University’s North Campus a day earlier. However, a student group denied the allegations, claiming that its members were targeted instead.The YouTuber stated that she had gone to cover a protest demanding the implementation of new UGC regulations and was attacked after being asked her name.""I had gone to cover the protest, as I regularly do. Before I could even take out my mic, a person behind me tried to instigate me by repeatedly taking my name. When I asked him what the issue was, he asked for my name and caste. I told him my name and asked what had happened. After that, things escalated,"" the YouTuber said.""The entire crowd came towards me and attacked me. This is clear in the video. About 500 people attacked me. They just have fake narrations and fake allegations. The girls around me whispered rape threats in my ears just because I am a Brahmin; ""aaj tu chal, tera nanga parade niklega,"" is what they said. The men around me were saying that they would teach me a lesson.The girls had held me by the arms and neck. This is an attempt to murder. I had fallen unconscious, but the Police did nothing, "" she told ANI.YouTuber alleged that the reason the mob targeted her for her caste and that she was now registered an FIR in the case.""A boy there was signalling to others to take me away. Did they want to kidnap me? My clothes were being torn. I was being improperly touched. They were goons, they cannot be students. I was attacked due to my caste. Nobody supported me, only a few Law Faculties showed humanity, and I came out with their help as well as with that of a few women Police personnel. FIR has been registered, I trust the law .The incident occurred for about half an hour. There was mob lynching there, I escaped somehow is a big deal for me."" she claimed.""There was also a car with its gate open, and gestures were being made suggesting I be taken inside. I have filed a complaint with the police,"" she added.Meanwhile, Delhi University vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh described the incident as a matter of concern and said maintaining social harmony was everyone’s responsibility.The All India Students' Association (AISA) said in a statement that the protest over the UGC regulations was peaceful and that its activists intervened after the YouTuber allegedly created a disruption and confronted a journalist at the site.It termed the allegations ""false and motivated"" and said two of its members were later threatened and faced abuse at the police station when they went to file a complaint.The student outfit also claimed that videos circulating online do not show the full sequence of events. Multiple videos of the incident have been shared on social media with each side claiming that the onus lies with the other side.Delhi Police said two FIRs have been registered based on complaints filed by the YouTuber and a woman student affiliated with AISA.The Delhi University VC posted on X, requesting all teachers and students to maintain harmony among themselves. ""Do not engage in any activity that increases mutual discord and harms the image of the nation and the university,"" he said.Singh said students from all states of India and all communities study in the university. ""Social harmony is the greatest thing, and maintaining it is the duty of all of us,"" he wrote on X.""I have spoken with several student groups and teacher groups today and have also spoken with the police administration to ensure that no such incident occurs in the future that harms harmony. The new rules of the UGC that have come are currently under consideration in the Hon'ble Supreme Court.""I appeal to all teachers and students of the university to maintain their trust in the Government of India and await the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court,"" the VC said.Chaos marked a protest called by Left-backed student unions at Delhi University on Friday evening. The unrest followed a separate protest organised by the All India Forum for Equity to observe ‘All India Vanchit Adhikar Divas’ at the Arts Faculty, which allegedly witnessed scenes of violence. The students were demanding that the University Grants Commission (UGC) Regulations address and eliminate caste discrimination on campuses across India.A face-off between two student groups triggered claims and counter-claims, with each side accusing the other of violence and intimidation. According to the Left-backed student union AISA, some students were allegedly threatened and subjected to casteist abuse and slurs by a rival group.AISA activists further claimed that when they went to a local police station to register an FIR against the alleged attackers, members of the rival group ABVP — affiliated with the BJP — attacked them.In its statement the AISA said, ""Delhi Police repeatedly failed to disperse the attacking mob and even if they moved away this mob kept coming back. While the lawyer of the students inside was not allowed to enter the police station, the people against whom the complaint was being made entered and with them some goons even entered the station.""""The mob at this time became even more agitated and tried to surround those who had come in solidarity against the mob attack in order to attack them. Instead of removing the violent crowd, the police stood by and watched as the mob raised slogans like ""Desh ke gaddaron ko, goli maro salon ko"" (Shoot the traitors of the country), ""Brahmanwad Zindabad"" (Long live Brahmanism) and other violent gestures aimed particularly women comrades,"" AISA alleged in its statement.Countering these allegations, ABVP alleged that a female journalist, associated with a YouTube channel was allegedly assaulted by Left backed student activists. ABVP said that the incident exposes the violent character of Left-affiliated student organisations, which otherwise claim to champion freedom of expression across universities in the country.Meanwhile, a senior police officer said that FIRs have been filed in the case, and they have begun an inquiry.""Two FIRs have been registered, including one where the complainant is a female YouTuber and another, a female student from AISA. Both the FIRs have been registered under Sections 74 (assault or criminal force against a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 115(2) (voluntarily causing hurt), 126(2) (wrongful restraint) and 3(5) (common intention) of the BNS. Further action will be taken accordingly,"" the officer said.","A woman YouTuber claims she was assaulted and that an attempt was made to forcibly take her away during a protest at Delhi University’s North Campus.

DEHRADUN: In a major breakthrough in the probe into the daylight murder of 54-year-old Jharkhand gangster Vikram Sharma in Dehradun on Friday morning, Uttarakhand police on Saturday claimed to have unravelled the conspiracy and identified all three assailants.A senior officer at the police headquarters (PHQ), monitoring the investigation, told TOI that Sharma was ""killed on the directions of gangster Akhilesh Singh"", who is currently lodged in Dumka Central Jail in Jharkhand. Sharma had allegedly mentored Singh in the past, helping him establish himself in the criminal network.""It emerged during the probe that there was a dispute between the two over the sharing of extortion money. Since Singh is in jail, Sharma allegedly siphoned off a larger share, which enraged him. Over the same dispute, Singh had attempted to eliminate Sharma two months ago during his visit to Jharkhand but failed. On Friday, he succeeded,"" said the officer, requesting anonymity.Sharma, who was named in more than 50 criminal cases, including the 2007 murder of Sreeleathers co-owner Ashish Dey in Jamshedpur, was out on bail.He had been living in a rented apartment in Dehradun for over a year and regularly visited a gym inside a shopping complex on Rajpur Road. He was shot dead by three unidentified assailants on Friday morning after stepping out of the gym.The officer said police have identified all three accused and traced the route they took to flee the scene. ""After escaping on a motorbike, they reached Haridwar and stayed in a hotel for a few hours before boarding a train to leave the state. They have been identified and will be arrested soon. The investigation also revealed that Sharma was shot in the head from behind at point-blank range, indicating the attackers were professional and intended to leave no chance of survival,"" he added.When contacted, Uttarakhand DGP Deepam Seth declined to share further details, citing the ongoing investigation. ""However, we can confirm that the motive behind the murder has been established and the shooters, who are from Jharkhand, have been identified. Uttarakhand STF teams are coordinating with their counterparts in Jharkhand to arrest the accused at the earliest,"" Seth said.","Jharkhand gangster Vikram Sharma, 54, was shot dead in Dehradun on Friday.

NOIDA: A three-year-old boy tragically lost his life after falling into a water-filled pit in Dallelgarh village under the Dankaur police station area of Greater Noida on Saturday. The incident has sparked anger among villagers, who allege negligence on the part of the local authority.According to information shared by residents, Anjali, a native of Dallelgarh, had recently come to her parental home from Sikandrabad in Bulandshahr along with her son Devansh and daughter. On Saturday, the family attended a community feast (bhandara) at a nearby temple in the village.While playing near the temple premises, Devansh reportedly slipped and fell into a deep pit filled with rainwater.Family members and villagers rushed to rescue the child as soon as they noticed he was missing. However, by the time they managed to pull him out of the water, he had already stopped breathing.The child’s sudden death has left the family devastated and the village in mourning.Villagers claimed that the pit had been lying open for a long time and had filled with water after recent rains.They alleged that, despite repeated complaints to the Greater Noida Authority following a similar incident in Sector-150—when 27-year-old techie Yuvraj Mehta tragically died after his car fell into a water-filled pit—no action was taken to fill the hazardous pits or implement proper safety measures.Residents have demanded immediate action to prevent such tragedies in the future.","A three-year-old boy tragically lost his life after falling into a water-filled pit in Dallelgarh village under the Dankaur police station area of Greater Noida on Saturday.

BHUBANESWAR: What began as a suspected bomb-making operation on a rooftop in the Airfield area ended in flames, panic and two deaths, with a horrific video of the explosion now surfacing.Sehnawaz Malik (26), a history-sheeter, who suffered critical burn injuries in the Jan 27 crude bomb explosion, succumbed during treatment on February 4. Days later, his mother Lizatun Bibi (51), who was also grievously injured in the blast, died at SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack on February 10.Malik, Bibi, Malik’s fiancée Truptimayee Mahal (23), and associate Amiya Mallick (27) were critically injured when one or more crude bombs allegedly being assembled on the rooftop of Malik’s residence exploded. Mahal and Mallick remain under treatment at a private hospital in Bhubaneswar.Police said Malik had sustained severe burns. “He had suffered serious burn injuries. He died in the afternoon,” an officer of the Airfield police station said.Investigators suspect the explosion occurred while bombs were being prepared. Malik, who had seven prior criminal cases, including attempted murder and offences under the Arms Act, had been released on bail around six months ago following a political clash in Nayapalli and was under police watch.The intensity of the blast prompted a preliminary inquiry by the National Investigation Agency. The agency later ruled out any terror or radicalisation links, though officials said they examined whether the case involved a larger conspiracy.Forensic sources indicated that highly explosive materials may have been used. “Preliminary findings suggest the possible use of hexahydro trinitro triazine, a compound associated with high explosives. Further analysis is underway,” a forensic official said.Soon after the explosion, bomb disposal squads, fire personnel and forensic teams rushed to the site, collecting remnants and seizing raw materials suspected to have been used in bomb-making.Residents of the rented three-storey building said they were unaware of the alleged illegal activity. “We had no idea. Everyone’s lives were endangered,” a tenant said.Police are continuing to probe whether Malik acted alone or had accomplices, and whether the bombs were intended for criminal or political violence. Authorities said vigilance has been stepped up in sensitive areas of the city following the incident.Meanwhile, a video purportedly capturing the moments of the blast has surfaced, showing flames and chaos on the rooftop. Police said the footage is being verified as part of the investigation.","Sehnawaz Malik (26), a history-sheeter, who suffered critical burn injuries in the Jan 27 crude bomb explosion, succumbed during treatment on February 4.

The driver has been identified as Anas Ali, 24.Police said Ali was carrying two cellphones. On one handset, he had downloaded a Rapido customer app and made fake journey bookings through it. Through the other phone, he would accept the same fraudulent booking using Rapido captain app meant for drivers.On Feb 12, around 12.30pm, Rapido's representative and a Sahar Police constable were carrying out joint checks outside Mumbai international airport as they had received several complaints about passengers being duped.When the representative asked Ali about the passenger's journey booking, Ali showed one of his phones. This immediately sparked suspicion in the representative's mind and he quizzed Ali. But Ali couldn't give satisfactory responses and was taken to the police station with his cab and his two mobilephones.","Cab driver Anas Ali, 24, arrested by Sahar Police for cheating passengers.
