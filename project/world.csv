Dr. Manmohan Singh, Hon'ble Prime Minister's Press Conference

NEW DELHI: In one of his last press conferences as Prime Minister back in January 2014, Dr Manmohan Singh , who passed away at the age of 92 on Thursday, gave a fitting response to growing criticism about his leadership and remarked that 'history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media.'The press conference featured questions about the Congress veteran's leadership, which some called weak and indecisive. Singh faced these questions amid Bharatiya Janata Party's campaign to portray their PM candidate Narendra Modi as a strong leader.Singh defended his record, saying, ""I do not believe that I have been a weak Prime Minister. I honestly believe that history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media or for that matter the opposition in Parliament. Given the political compulsions, I have done the best I could do.""He added, ""I have done as well as I could do according to the circumstances. It is for history to judge what I have done or what I have not done.""Singh's term ended when Narendra Modi became PM in May 2014.Criticising Modi and the 2002 Gujarat riots, Singh had said, ""If you measure the strength of Prime Minister by presiding over mass massacre of innocent citizens on streets of Ahmedabad, then I do not believe in it. I do not think that this kind of strength this country needs least from its Prime Minister. I sincerely believe what Narendra Modi is saying is not going to materialise,"" he stated.He also highlighted the Congress party's success in managing coalition governments during his two terms, saying compromises were made on 'peripheral issues and not on national problems.' When asked about internal criticism within the Congress, Singh responded, ""Nobody has asked me to step down because of any inadequacy that characterised my tenure as prime minister.""","Dr Manmohan Singh gave a fitting response to growing criticism about his leadership and remarked that 'history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media' The press conference featured questions about the Congress veteran's leadership, which some called weak and indecisive.

Twist in Hathras case: 13-year-old boy held for killing fellow student,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/twist-in-hathras-case-13-year-old-boy-held-for-killing-fellow-student/articleshow/116696298.cms,"School brushed aside 2 previous strangling bids

AGRA: Three months ago, five people - the owner of a residential school in Hathras, his son who was its manager, and three teachers - were arrested for the murder of Kritarth Kushwaha , an 11-year-old Class 2 student. The details were macabre enough to ignite outrage: they killed the boy in ritualistic sacrifice ""to bring glory to the school"". The manager then carried the body in a car and drove from Hathras to Aligarh, and then to Agra, to erase their tracks.Now, in a sensational twist, the police chargesheet has absolved the five of murder, reducing their culpability to ""tampering with evidence"". The real culprit, police say, is a 13-year-old Class 8 student from the same school. Disillusioned with life at DL Public School , the boy allegedly sought to bring the institution to its knees by orchestrating its closure. Murdering a student, he believed, would do the job. Before Kritarth, he had tried twice but failed, cops claim.But what made police change track after the five arrested persons had allegedly ""confessed""? Hathras ASP Ashok Kumar, who led the probe, told TOI, ""It was based on preliminary evidence collected at the crime scene that we arrested the five individuals.""At first glance, the case was indeed clear-cut. The accused had, after all, travelled long distances in his car with the dead child's body in the boot of his vehicle. Kumar said, ""Our probe was still on and weeks of interviews with other teachers, students and domestic staff uncovered inconsistencies that challenged the narrative. Through follow-ups, new evidence emerged that led us to the teenager.""The boy was quietly whisked into custody on Dec 16 and sent to a juvenile home. In July, he had attempted to strangle two other students but the school brushed aside these incidents as ""minor acts of misbehaviour"". On Sept 22, his obsession took a darker shape.

CHENNAI: A 37-year-old man with a criminal record allegedly raped a second-year engineering student of Chennai's Anna University on campus after filming her with a male friend and trying to blackmail them with the footage.Suspect Gnanasekaran, who runs a roadside eatery near the campus, was arrested Wednesday, a day after the survivor called a police helpline to report the assault on her the previous evening.Amid an uproar over the alleged rape and lack of safety on campus, cops issued a statement saying varsity authorities and senior cops would jointly review potential security loopholes and plug these.Opposition members, including AIADMK general secretary Edappadi K Palaniswami, BJP state chief K Annamalai, PMK founder Dr S Ramadoss and AMMK chief TTV Dhinakaran, slammed the MK Stalin-led DMK govt for what they said was worsening security on educational campuses.State higher education minister Govi Chezhian said action would be initiated to ensure crimes don't recur. He said those trying to politicise the issue should not forget 2019 Pollachi sexual assault cases when AIADMK was in office.Investigators said the survivor was with her friend behind an old building in a desolate portion of the campus, close to Raj Bhavan and IIT Madras, when the crime occurred around 8pm on Dec 23.The complaint states that Gnanasekaran came up to the couple and claimed to have recorded their alleged intimate moments.

Russia's priorities for 2025

Trump's ceasefire vision

Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed unwavering confidence in Russia's triumph in its conflict with Ukraine, asserting that divine support is on Moscow's side. Speaking to reporters on Thursday after attending the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council (SEEC) meeting in St. Petersburg, Putin’s remarks stirred fresh debate amid ongoing speculation about US mediation efforts.When asked whether Russia would secure victory by 2025, Putin said, “I believe in God. And God is with us.” His comments come as reports surface of a US proposal to ""freeze"" the conflict along current front lines in exchange for delaying Ukraine’s NATO membership.Putin dismissed the idea, recalling that a similar proposal had been made by outgoing US President Joe Biden in 2021. “At that time, we told the US such a deal was unacceptable to Moscow,” Putin said.The Russian leader reiterated that Moscow’s top goal remains achieving success on the battlefield while addressing key domestic issues. “We are striving to end the conflict,” he said, but stressed the importance of military, economic, and social objectives. “We believe that we will be successful on the front line and accomplish our objectives in the field of the economy, as well as resolve social issues, the issues of military security, and security in the broadest sense.”Adding a new layer to the geopolitical landscape, US President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to broker a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine within hours of taking office. While Trump has yet to outline the specifics of his proposal, American media reports suggest it could involve freezing territorial control for both sides.However, both Moscow and Kiev have rejected the idea of an unconditional ceasefire. Putin emphasized that Russia remains committed to advancing its plans, signaling little interest in halting the conflict on US terms.As the war drags on, the conflicting visions for its resolution—ranging from Putin's battlefield-driven objectives to Trump's proposed negotiations—highlight the deep divides shaping the global response to the Ukraine crisis.","Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed unwavering confidence in Russia's triumph in its conflict with Ukraine.

Additionally, federal grant documents detailing a “blueprint” for engineering viruses like SARS-CoV-2 were improperly classified, according to whistleblower Lt. Col. Joseph Murphy.FBI scientist Jason Bannan, whose team supported the lab leak theory, criticized the lack of transparency in the intelligence community’s findings. “What ended up on the cutting-room floor needs to be re-examined,” Bannan told The Wall Street Journal.The suppressed findings have reignited demands for a deeper probe into Covid-19’s origins, as the virus has claimed over 1.2 million American lives since 2019.","Spy chiefs allegedly silenced US defense department and FBI researchers who uncovered evidence supporting the theory that Covid-19 leaked from a Chinese lab.

JonBenét Ramsey case revived: New tips spark hope for justice after 28 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jonbent-ramsey-case-revived-new-tips-spark-hope-for-justice-after-28-years/articleshow/116693382.cms,"Cold Case

: Who Killed JonBenét Ramsey

Twenty-eight years after the tragic murder of JonBenét Ramsey , new leads have emerged, reigniting hope for answers in a case that has haunted the nation. The six-year-old beauty queen was found dead in the basement of her family’s Boulder home in December 1996, having been strangled and bludgeoned.Despite years of investigation, her killer remains unidentified.Since the release of the Netflix documentaryin November, the Boulder Police Department has received over 100 new tips. An investigator from the joint task force working on the case confirmed the surge in information.“The next move is to decide which ones are credible and which ones are not.” the investigator said.“But we’re looking at every single tip and deciding if it can help us solve the case. It’s a priority here.”This development offers a glimmer of hope to the Ramsey family, who have spent decades seeking justice. JonBenét’s parents, John and the late Patsy Ramsey, faced initial suspicion but were formally exonerated in 2008 following DNA evidence that cleared them and JonBenét’s brother, Burke, of involvement.John Ramsey and his son, John Andrew Ramsey, participated in the Netflix documentary, hoping to encourage anyone with knowledge to come forward.“A key reason why we continue participating in media interviews is the hope of compelling that one person who knows something to come forward,” said John Andrew, who was a teenager visiting his mother at the time of the murder.JonBenét’s death has long perplexed authorities. She was reported missing on Christmas Day 1996, and her father later discovered her body in the family’s basement. The grisly scene included a garrote around her neck and a fractured skull from a severe blow to the head.In a significant move, John Ramsey, now 80, announced plans to meet with Boulder Police Chief Stephen Redfearn in January. Accompanied by a representative from an independent genetic genealogy lab, Ramsey aims to convince the police to allow advanced testing of crime-scene evidence.“We’ve requested a meeting with Chief Redfearn, and he’s agreed,” Ramsey told Fox News Digital.“We haven’t scheduled the day yet, but we’ll get that figured out. That’s an important meeting. We’re going to have a representative with us for one of these cutting-edge labs to explain what they can and can’t do. Hopefully, he will accept their help.”Redfearn, who recently took over as Boulder Police Chief, has expressed determination to solve the case, which remains a blemish on the department’s record.“This is a major public black mark for the Boulder Police,” the investigator admitted. “It’s in everyone’s best interest to close this case, and we’re fully committed now.”The Ramsey family is urging anyone with information to contact the authorities.“Even the smallest piece of information could be the breakthrough we need,” John Andrew Ramsey said.“Your decision to come forward could help bring us the answers we’ve been seeking for so long.”With renewed attention and advances in forensic technology, there is cautious optimism that justice for JonBenét may finally be within reach.","JonBenét Ramsey, 6, was found strangled and bludgeoned to death in 1996.

Azerbaijan Airlines passenger plane crashes in Kazakhstan

Nearby Russian airport closed



A survivor of crashed Azerbaijan Airlines flight managed to record footage from inside the cabin on Wednesday. The Azerbaijan Airlines plane with 62 passengers and five crew on board crashed in Kazakhstan.Kazakh authorities announced that 32 survivors were rescued from the site.Azerbaijan Airlines flight J2-8243 had flown hundreds of miles off its scheduled route to crash on the opposite shore of the Caspian Sea, after what Russia's aviation watchdog said was an emergency that may have been caused by a bird strike.A video shot by a survivor showed the aftermath of the crash from inside the cabin while a man tried to get out of the wreckage.Meanwhile, Azerbaijan Airlines suspended all its flights from Baku to Russia's Chechnya region until an investigation into the fatal crash is finished.Another video showed a passenger repeating ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is great) as the plane plunged into a steep descent. Yellow oxygen masks were seen dangling from overhead compartments, while cries and screams echoed throughout the cabin.Officials have yet to clarify the reasons behind the plane's sea crossing, but the crash occurred shortly after drone strikes targeted southern Russia. In the past, drone activity has led to airport closures in the region, and the nearest Russian airport along the flight path was shut down on Wednesday morning.Footage of the crash captured the aircraft plunging rapidly before erupting into flames upon impact with the seashore. Thick black smoke billowed into the sky, while passengers, visibly injured and shaken, stumbled away from a section of the fuselage that remained intact.Kazakhstan's emergencies ministry issued a statement confirming that fire services had extinguished the blaze. Survivors, including two children, were receiving medical attention at a nearby hospital. Efforts were underway to recover the bodies of the deceased.Azerbaijan Airlines reported that the Embraer 190 jet had been en route from Baku to Grozny, the capital of Chechnya in southern Russia. However, an emergency forced the aircraft to attempt a landing approximately 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) from Aktau, Kazakhstan.According to Russia’s aviation watchdog, “Preliminary findings suggest a collision with birds caused an emergency situation on board, prompting the pilot to divert to an alternate airfield. Aktau was selected.”Aktau, located on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea, lies across from Azerbaijan and Russia. Flight tracking websites showed the aircraft initially following its planned route along the western coastline before its signal was lost. The flight later reappeared on the eastern shore, circling near Aktau airport before crashing on the beach.Meanwhile, drone strikes were reported in the Russian regions of Ingushetia and North Ossetia, adjacent to Chechnya, on Wednesday morning. An official at Makhachkala airport, the nearest to the flight's last known location, confirmed it had been closed to incoming traffic for several hours. Attempts to reach officials at Grozny airport were unsuccessful.Kazakh authorities announced the formation of a government commission to investigate the crash. Members of the commission were directed to the crash site to oversee the investigation and ensure support for the victims’ families. Kazakhstan pledged to collaborate with Azerbaijan on the inquiry.Russian President Vladimir Putin and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev extended their condolences. President Aliyev decided to return home from Russia, where he had been scheduled to attend a summit on Wednesday.Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-backed leader of Chechnya, also expressed his sympathies. He noted that some of the injured were in critical condition and urged prayers for their recovery.","Azerbaijan Airlines flight J2-8243 crashed near Aktau, Kazakhstan, on Wednesday. 32 survivors were rescued from the crash site.

Canada has officially ended the practice of flagpoling for work and study permits at its ports of entry.Effective from December 23 at 11.59 pm ET, foreign nationals holding temporary resident status in Canada must submit renewal applications through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) instead of re-entering Canada after briefly leaving for expedited immigration services, according to a statement by the Canada Border Services Agency .Flagpoling has long been used by temporary residents to bypass typical processing wait times for work and study permits. However, Canadian authorities now aim to streamline port operations and enhance border enforcement.“This change will enable us to further streamline activities at our ports of entry and allow Canadian and American border officers to focus on what they have been expertly trained to do – border enforcement,” public safety minister David McGuinty said in a statement, as reported by CBC News.Flagpoling has placed a significant burden on Canadian and American border services. Between April 1, 2023, and March 31, 2024, the CBSA processed over 69,300 flagpolers, primarily in regions like the Pacific, southern Ontario, and Quebec, according to CIC News.The CBSA emphasised that border services are intended for individuals entering Canada rather than those already in the country. Diverting resources for flagpolers has added congestion and hindered critical border enforcement activities.“A strong Canada-US relationship keeps people and goods moving safely while protecting both sides of the border,” immigration minister Marc Miller said, adding that the policy shift would enhance fairness, ease border congestion, and improve overall border efficiency.Certain groups will still qualify for port-of-entry processing under specific circumstances:Those who attempt to flagpole without meeting these criteria will be redirected to IRCC for their applications.The policy is likely part of a broader initiative to bolster Canada-US border security . The Liberal government's fall economic update allocated $1.3 billion over six years for measures like drones, helicopters, and improved monitoring of the shared border. The changes also come amid concerns over potential US tariffs.Flagpoling, once a viable option for expediting permits, is now phased out to prioritize border security and efficient management. Applicants are being urged to use IRCC’s online services for work or study permit renewals moving forward.","Canada has officially ended the practice of flagpoling for work and study permits at its ports of entry.Effective from December 23 at 11.59 pm ET, foreign nationals holding temporary resident status in Canada must submit renewal applications through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.

British-Indian writer says he had a chat with Luigi Mangione: 'His major concern was...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/british-indian-writer-says-he-had-a-chat-with-luigi-mangione-his-major-concern-was-/articleshow/116656189.cms,"Luigi Mangione was concerned about 'non-playing characters' and identified himself as one, a writer revealed.

Agency was a major concern of Luigi's

'I was sickened. Vigilantism is always wrong'

'I didn't know he had spinal or mental issues'

British-Indian writer Gurwinder Bhogal has claimed that long before the shocking murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, he had a video call and a chat with accused Luigi Mangione around April-May when Mangione was vacationing in Japan.The author described how Luigi Mangione reached out to him through membership of his blog and was warm and gregarious. Mangione told him that he was on holiday in Japan and loved the culture there -- its sense of honor. ""One morning in Japan, he saw a man having a seizure in the street, so he ran to the nearest police station for help. They followed him back to the man, but refused to cross any street if the stoplight was red—even if the road was empty—as the man was seizing on the ground. Mangione lamented what he called “a lack of free will” in Japan, by which he meant a lack of agency,"" Bhogal described an anecdote from his interaction with Mangione.""I quickly realised that agency was a major concern of Luigi’s,"" the writer added.""Luigi believed people everywhere were becoming NPCs (Non-player characters -- people who don't think for themselves), increasingly living their lives as a series of reflex reactions rather than consciously choosing their behaviours. The West was following closely behind Japan, driven by tech companies intent on mesmerising us into servile consumers. Luigi feared that once we’d surrendered our agency, we’d surrender everything else,"" Bhogal wrote.Mangione too identified as an NPC living much of his life on autopilot, he told the author recalling how he sometimes wasted whole afternoons doomscrolling social media. ""He said he wanted to regain some of the agency he felt he'd lost to online distractions, so we spent much of the chat discussing ways he could become more active,"" the writer wrote adding that he thought Mangione was someone who had a desire to help even those whom he didn't know.The writer then described how he withdrew himself from social media and didn't notice that Mangione vanished and then came the murder and the social media glorification of the alleged murderer. ""If you celebrate someone gunning down a defenseless person in the street, then you advocate for a world in which this is an acceptable thing for anyone to do. You, in fact, advocate for a world in which a stranger can decide that you’re also a bad person, and gun you down in the street. In such a world, I promise you, your health insurance would cost much more,"" Bhogal wrote.The writer said that in his limited interactions with Mangione, he never got the impression he had spinal or mental issues. ""But I did get the sense he felt alienated. He often decried the lack of social connection in the modern world, and on a couple of occasions, he lamented that the people around him were 'on a different wavelength' to him,"" he wrote.","British-Indian writer Gurwinder Bhogal has claimed that long before the shocking murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, he had a video call and a chat with accused Luigi Mangione.

Sebastian Zapeta-Calil , the Guatemalan migrant charged with setting a sleeping woman on fire aboard a Brooklyn subway train, was known for his erratic behaviour after smoking K2 (synthetic drug) and drinking heavily, claimed his roommate at a homeless shelter where he lived.Zapeta-Calil, 33, was arraigned Tuesday in Brooklyn Criminal Court on first-degree murder and arson charges for the shocking attack early Sunday morning that left the unidentified woman dead. Surveillance footage captured Zapeta-Calil sitting on a bench watching as flames consumed the victim.Raymond Robinson, who shared a dormitory with Zapeta-Calil at the Samaritan Village Forbell men’s shelter in East New York, described him as a heavy user of K2 and a frequent drinker.""He smoked K2, drank, and bugged out,"" theRobinson. “He would bug out and talk to himself when he was high, but he never harmed nobody or himself. When he wasn’t high, he’d talk like we’re talking regular”, Robinson added.Despite his unpredictable behaviour, Robinson said Zapeta-Calil often came across as quiet and respectful. ""He was friendly. Say you just came in and needed some socks, he’d help you out,"" Robinson said, adding, “That’s why this s**t f***ed my head up because I slept next to him, and he was never like that.”""I wouldn’t leave my daughter with anybody but he was the type of dude I could trust, as long as he wasn’t high”, Robinson added.The brutal attack unfolded at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station. Police said Zapeta-Calil approached the sleeping woman, set her clothes on fire with a lighter, and then used a shirt to fan the flames, as captured in video evidence.Prosecutors allege that Zapeta-Calil watched the woman burn while sitting calmly on a bench. The victim was pronounced dead at the scene, with authorities citing ""thermal injuries and smoke inhalation"" as the cause of death.Other residents at the shelter painted a complex picture of Zapeta-Calil, describing him as someone who frequently drank cheap vodka and smoked K2. According to the, he was deported to Guatemala in 2018 but later returned illegally to the United States.As per the New York Post, José Acosta, another shelter resident, said Zapeta-Calil worked in construction and regularly sent money back to his family in Guatemala. But others described him as increasingly dishevelled and distant in recent weeks.Juan Medrano, who also lived at the shelter, said Zapeta-Calil was often ""in his own world"" but noted he had never been in trouble there before.Zapeta-Calil remains in custody without bail as prosecutors detail evidence of his actions. He reportedly told police he was so intoxicated that he doesn’t remember the attack.","Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, 33, is accused of setting a sleeping woman on fire aboard a Brooklyn subway train.

May 9 Riots and aftermath

International outcry

Pakistan's response

Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots that targeted military sites and other facilities following the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan This brings the total number of convictions related to the unrest to 85, according to announcements from the military’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).Among those sentenced is Hassan Niazi , Khan’s nephew, who received a 10-year prison term for his alleged role in the attack on the Lahore Corps Commander’s residence, also known as Jinnah House.The ISPR stated that the Field General Court Martial handed down the sentences after reviewing evidence and ensuring due process. “Sequel to the announcement of the May 9 punishments... the Field General Court Martial has promulgated the punishments to the following remaining 60 culprits after examining all evidence, ensuring the provision of all legal rights to the convicts, completion of due process, and the appropriate legal proceedings,” the ISPR announced.The convicted individuals face sentences ranging from two to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment. They have the right to appeal the decisions under Pakistan's Constitution.The unrest on May 9 erupted after Imran Khan’s arrest in a corruption case. Supporters of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party allegedly attacked key military installations, including the Army General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, the Corps Commander’s House in Lahore, and an ISI office in Faisalabad.In response, authorities detained hundreds of individuals, and 103 were handed over to military courts for trial, sparking widespread criticism of the opaque judicial process.The convictions have drawn sharp rebukes from international entities, including the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union. Critics argue that the use of military courts to try civilians undermines judicial independence and transparency.“These military courts lack judicial independence, transparency, and due process guarantees,” the US State Department said. Similarly, the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCO) criticized the lack of transparency and independent oversight in the trials, emphasizing the importance of adhering to fair trial standards under international law.The European Union also expressed concern, highlighting that Pakistan’s actions contradict its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and commitments tied to the GSP+ trade program.The Pakistani government has defended the use of military courts, citing the Supreme Court’s decision that allowed the military to proceed with trials of civilians involved in the riots. The Foreign Office reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to international human rights obligations, asserting that the trials were conducted in accordance with national laws.The ISPR emphasized that the convictions reflect the military’s resolve to uphold justice and maintain the authority of the state, stating, “The Nation, Government, and Armed Forces remain steadfast in their commitment to upholding justice and ensuring that the inviolable writ of the state is maintained.”","Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots.

This has been the fourth time in the past few years that Pakistan has conducted airstrikes inside Afghanistan, and the second time since March 2024.“Last night (Tuesday), Pakistan bombarded four points in Barmal district of Paktika province. The total number of dead is 46, most of whom were children and women,” said Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesperson for the Afghan Taliban govt. He added that six others, mostly children, were wounded.Condemning the airstrikes, the Afghan defence ministry called them “barbaric” and a clear “aggression”. It stated that several refugees, including women and children, were killed and injured. “The Pakistani side should understand that such arbitrary measures are not a solution to any problem,” Enayatullah Khowarazami, spokesperson for Afghanistan’s defence ministry, wrote on social media platform ‘X’. “The Islamic Emirate (Afghan Taliban regime) will not leave this cowardly act unanswered, but rather considers the defence of its territory and sovereignty to be its inalienable right,” he added.The strikes took place hours after Pakistan special representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq met interim Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul, intending to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long gap. The deteriorating ties, however, are likely to worsen following Tuesday night’s airstrikes, analysts said.Pakistan alleges the Afghan government harbours armed groups, particularly the TTP, which conducts cross-border assaults against Pakistani security forces. In one of the worst recent assaults on security forces, the TTP had claimed responsibility for the killing of at least 16 Pakistani soldiers in South Waziristan last week.Kabul, however, denies providing shelter to armed groups or allowing their territory to be used for cross-border attacks.Border tensions between the two countries have surged since the Taliban regime took control in 2021, with Pakistan experiencing a revival of militant activity along its western border. Deadly air attacks by Pakistan’s military in Afghan border regions in March, which the Taliban claimed killed eight civilians, had sparked confrontations along the the disputed border between the two countries.","Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province.

He clarified that military courts only handle cases involving attacks on defence establishments, citing incidents such as the attack on the Corps Commander's House in Lahore.The minister also criticised the PTI for changing its stance regarding trials of civilians in the military courts, recalling that during Khan's tenure, military court trials were praised.""The statements praising the military courts from PTI's leadership are still available on social media. Yet now, the same individuals are lobbying internationally against these courts,"" Tarar said.He assured that military trials adhere to fair trial principles and dismissed claims of injustice in military trials.The military courts tasked to hear cases of suspects involved in the attacks on military facilities on the May 9, 2023 protest last week sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from 2-10 years.Khan's party criticized the verdicts, arguing that military courts have no jurisdiction over civilians.",Information minister Attaullah Tarar says military courts are competent to deal with cases related to attacks on army facilities.

Six more people, mostly children, were wounded, the Taliban government spokesman informed.The strikes hit seven villages, including Laman, where five members of a single family lost their lives.According to reports, Pakistani jets were responsible for the bombings, with Murg Bazaar village bearing significant destruction.The Taliban’s ministry of defence condemned the airstrikes and vowed retaliation. “Defending our land and sovereignty is our legitimate right,” the ministry stated, adding that ""Waziristani refugees"" were among the victims.Official casualty figures have not yet been disclosed, but at least 15 bodies have reportedly been recovered.The airstrikes occur against a backdrop of escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, particularly over the presence of militants from Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghan territory. Pakistan has repeatedly accused the Afghan Taliban of providing shelter to TTP fighters, who have increased attacks on Pakistani forces in recent months. In response, the Afghan Taliban denies these allegations, asserting that civilians, not militants, were targeted in the latest strikes.“The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan considers this a brutal act against all international principles and blatant aggression and strongly condemns it,” said the Afghan ministry of defence. “The Islamic Emirate will not leave this cowardly act unanswered but rather considers the defense of its territory to be its inalienable right.”Islamabad contends that many TTP leaders and fighters have fled to Afghanistan, finding refuge in border provinces under Taliban protection. Afghan officials, however, have refuted these claims, stating that the victims of the bombings were primarily displaced civilians.The strikes came just after Mohammad Sadiq, Pakistan’s special representative for Afghanistan, visited Kabul for discussions on trade and bilateral relations. The timing has fueled speculation about a deterioration in diplomatic ties between the two neighbors.The TTP, which ended a ceasefire with the Pakistani government in November 2022, has intensified its attacks on Pakistani security forces. These attacks have killed and injured dozens of soldiers in recent months, heightening security concerns in Islamabad.","Pakistan launched a series of airstrikes targeting Afghanistan’s Barmal district in Paktika province on the night of December 24, killing at least 46 people, including women and children.

PM Shehbaz Sharif reject US sanctions on Pak missile programme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pm-shehbaz-sharif-reject-us-sanctions-on-pak-missile-programme/articleshow/116639941.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif criticised the US on Tuesday for imposing sanctions on his country’s ballistic missile programme, saying there was “no justification” for it.Washington had announced on Dec 12 that it was imposing more restrictions on Pakistan’s long-range ballistic-missile system, including on the state-owned National Development Complex (NDC),which oversees the programme. The sanctions had frozen any US property owned by the targeted entities and barred US nationals from doing business with them.“Pakistan does not harbour any intention in which its nuclear system is aggressive, it is 100% in Pakistan’s defence. It is just intended for deterrence purposes and nothing else,” Sharif told cabinet members during a meeting.Noting that his foreign affairs ministry had given a “comprehensive response” to Washington on the matter, Sharif said, “This programme is not mine, nor any political party’s; it belongs to the 240 million people of this country, and it is dear to them. There will be no compromise on this programme, and the entire nation is united on this issue.”According to a US state department factsheet, the Islamabad-based NDC had sought to obtain components for Pakistan’s long-range ballistic-missile programme and missile-testing equipment. It stated the NDC “is responsible for the development of Pakistan’s ballistic missiles,” including the Shaheen family of missiles.The US sanctions were preceded by high-level military engagements between China and Pakistan. Last month, a top Chinese military official, General Zhang Youxia, visited Pakistan along with a high-ranking delegation. Youxia, who is vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), the overall command of the Chinese military headed by President Xi Jinping, had held one-on-one talks with Pakistan army chief Gen Asim Munir during his visit.

Their confessions came after an extensive Federal investigation agency (FIA) audit, conducted in 2022, revealed that 457 PIA employees had been recruited on fraudulent credentials.The accused, who initially denied the charges, later approached the court for pre-arrest bail, which was granted. However, during their indictment, they pleaded guilty and requested to record their confessional statements. Judge Tanveer Ahmad Sheikh ensured the accused understood the implications of their confessions, allowing them 30 minutes to reconsider before recording their statements.Nazia Naheed, a former stewardess from Karachi, admitted to using a fake BA degree to gain a promotion. Hired on a contract in 2001, she was terminated in 2014 when her forged credentials were discovered. Similarly, Mohsin Ali, a co-pilot since 2006, confessed to using a fake BA degree despite the job requiring only intermediate qualifications.Arif Tarar, who served 39 years with PIA, admitted to using a fake FA degree to move from peon to data entry operator. He retired in 2018 but was implicated in the FIA probe. Lastly, Kashan Aijaz Dodhy, a cadet pilot since 1995, confessed to submitting a fake BSc degree to show extra qualifications, leading to his termination in 2019.The court sentenced the four to imprisonment until the court’s rising and imposed fines.","Four former Pakistan international airlines (PIA) employees confessed to using fake degrees to secure employment or promotions.

Copying Cirus

MUMBAI: A little-known incident in the history of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme is a purported attempt made by the country in the early ’70s to copy the design of India’s Cirus reactor — a 40 MW thermal neutron research facility, which first achieved criticality at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Trombay, near Mumbai, on July 10, 1960. An acronym for Canada India Reactor Utility Services, Cirus was constructed with Canadian assistance at a shared cost of $14.14 million, according to news reports.Pakistan’s attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H. Khan , a man who played a role in the neighbouring country’s nuclear weapons programme. In his book “Eating Grass: The Making Of The Pakistani Bomb”, published in 2012 by the Stanford University Press, Feroz wrote, “Munir Ahmed Khan, later chairman of the PAEC [Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission], recalled that in October 1965 he had met Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto [the then Pakistan foreign minister] in Vienna. Munir explained to him that he had been to India’s Cirus facility at Trombay in 1964 and saw for himself that India was well on its way to making the [nuclear] bomb. Bhutto asked Munir to meet Ayub Khan in December during Ayub’s upcoming visits to the United Kingdom and the United States and try to convince the president of the urgency of a weapons programme.” The country eventually carried out its first nuclear weapons tests on May 28 and 30, 1998.Feroz’s disclosure, though now 12 years old, assumes immediate significance in the context of the US last week announcing fresh sanctions on Pakistan’smissile development programme. For the first time, the measures target Pakistan’s state-run National Development Complex, for its role in the country’s mission development programme. US deputy NSA Jon Finer has said, “Pakistan has developed increasingly sophisticated missile technology… If these trends continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States.”Feroz’s writing about the Cirus reactor is important because the plutonium for India’s Smiling Buddha project — the country’s first nuclear weapons test at Pokhran on May 18, 1974 — was from this reactor.According to Feroz, “Pakistani leadership wanted the rights to copy technological designs for its indigenous programme without incurring penalties and while remaining on the ‘good side’ of the international system.” He recalled: “While work to commission KANUPP [Karachi Nuclear Power Complex] went on, Munir Ahmed Khan said that there would be a secret team headed by a nuclear official, Sardar Ali Khan, to work on replicating India’s Cirus reactor.The author quotes Pervez Butt, who was purportedly part of the secret “copying’’ team and was chairman of PAEC between 2001 and 2005, as telling him, “Our team worked tirelessly, I did the mechanical part. When we merged our work and presented, Munir Khan could not believe it.”Feroz, however, has questioned Pakistan’s decision to copy the design of the Cirus reactor because there were some fundamental differences between Cirus and Kanupp.The team had modified the basic Cirus design.","Pakistan's attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H. Khan. Cirus was constructed with Canadian assistance at a shared cost of $14.14 million.

Meaningful dialogue based on positive intentions should be held,"" PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said.He stressed that the potential talks should have a defined timeframe, adding that the dialogue must progress positively considering the sensitivity of the situation.National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq had taken the lead by offering on Wednesday that he was ready to host the two sides and facilitate their parleys.He welcomed the newly constituted committee and invited the government and opposition for talks, saying ""the speaker's office is always open for members"", according to a statement issued by the NA Secretariat.The speaker called on members of both committees to meet on Monday morning, adding that he would meet them at his chambers in Parliament House.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram said his party accepted the speaker's invitation to meet. He said their committee will attend the meeting on Monday.Akram said the PTI founder will be informed about the progress of the meeting and he will decide whether to cancel the civil disobedience movement .The talks are being held after the PTI had threatened to give a call for civil disobedience.The party posted on X from the account of the jailed former prime minister regarding the call for civil disobedience movement, which was initially shared on December 19, stating that the campaign will be launched if the government doesn't make progress on the party's demands by Sunday.""I had presented two demands to the government, the release of under-trial political prisoners and the establishment of a judicial commission for a transparent investigation into the events of May 9, 2023 and November 26, 2024,"" the post quoted PTI founder Khan. It further stated that both of these demands ""are legitimate"".""If the government fails to take any action on them by Sunday, the first phase of the civil disobedience movement - 'remittance boycott' - will be launched,"" it said.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram also reiterated that the civil disobedience drive would be launched tomorrow (Monday) if the party's demands go unmet.However, the issue of civil disobedience has been apparently put on hold for some time while allowing the two sides to address the differences through political means.Khan, 72, on December 5 had warned of a civil disobedience movement from December 14 if his demands about the release of political prisoners facing trial and the formation of a judicial commission to probe the events of May 9, 2023, and November 26 this year were unmet.Meanwhile, Pakistan's military courts sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for attacking military installations during riots which erupted following the arrest of Khan in May last year, the Army announced on Saturday.On May 9, 2023, Khan's PTI supporters allegedly attacked several military installations, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi and the ISI building in Faisalabad, to vent their anger against the arrest of their party founder in a corruption case.Hundreds of suspects were arrested in the countrywide swoop and at least 103 were handed over to the military authorities for trial due to their involvement in attacks on military installations.Khan's party has launched multiple protests through 2023 and 2024 demanding the release of their supreme leader, the latest being in November 2024.The former prime minister, currently lodged at the Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, was arrested in August last year and faces multiple cases since his government was toppled in April 2022.","The committee includes deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, the prime minister's political aide Rana Sanaullah, education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, minister for privatisation Aleem Khan.

"1,566 terror attacks killed 924 in Pakistan over past 10 months",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/1566-terror-attacks-killed-924-in-pakistan-over-past-10-months/articleshow/116551393.cms,"KARACHI: Ten years have passed since Ajoon Khan's son died in a ghastly attack by the Pakistani Taliban that killed about 150 people, mostly children, at a military-run school in Peshawar, in northwestern Pakistan. But the pain of loss is unrelenting - it grows only deeper with time. Khan, a lawyer, said he could never forget the parents sobbing and pleading outside the school gates.The brutal assault on the school in Peshawar led to rare political unity in support of a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy for Pakistan and a vast military operation in the country's former tribal areas near Afghanistan. The efforts forced militants to retreat across the border and brought a degree of relative peace to Pakistan. Large-scale terrorist attacks were significantly reduced, with fatalities dropping from 2,451 across 1,717 attacks in 2013 to 220 in 146 attacks in 2020. But the hard-won gains are now in jeopardy.Over the past few years, violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan. Experts attribute the increase to the Afghan Taliban's seizure of power in neighbouring Afghanistan in Aug 2021.Last week, the interior ministry reported that 924 people, including civilians and law enforcement personnel, had been killed in 1,566 terrorist attacks across the country over the past 10 months. It said 341 terrorists had been killed during the period.Early on Saturday, sixteen soldiers were killed in northwest Pakistan in an attack by Islamist militants, a senior police official in the South Waziristan region said. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistan Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack, giving a higher figure for the number of personnel killed, Reuters reported.Experts and security officials have identified a range of challenges impeding Pakistan's progress against terrorism: political instability, weak governance, dwindling public support, economic constraints and reduced US counterterrorism assistance after the end of the 20-year war in Afghanistan.""The greatest challenge lies in mobilising the necessary financial resources and manpower for operations across such vast regions,"" said Muhammad Amir Rana, director of the Pak Institute for Peace Studies, a security think tank in Islamabad. The source of the problem for Pakistan, experts say, is found across the border, in Afghanistan.The Taliban administration in Kabul, the Afghan capital, denies accusations of harbouring militants from TTP. But Asfandyar Mir, a senior expert at the United States Institute of Peace, said the TTP had been given ""a permissive safe haven in Afghanistan,"" which had allowed it to become ""resilient and lethal.""Pakistani security officials privately acknowledged that they had misjudged how the new Taliban rulers of Afghanistan would handle TTP. The officials had anticipated that the Taliban leaders would help curb the TTP in return for the covert support that Pakistan had provided them during the US-led war. Instead, the Taliban in Kabul have provided the TTP with resources and advanced American-made weapons and equipment seized after the collapse of the US-supported Afghan govt, according to a senior security official in Islamabad who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The TTP has gone on to unleash a wave of attacks inside Pakistan as it wages a campaign whose aim is to overthrow the govt. Among them was a suicide bombing in January 2023 that killed over 100 people at a mosque in Peshawar.Pakistani security forces have also been locked in a conflict with ethnic separatist groups in Balochistan, an arid province bordering Afghanistan and Iran that is home to the Chinese-run port Gwadar. nyt","Violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan.

Pakistan’s military announced Saturday that 25 civilians have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their alleged involvement in violent protests following the arrest of former PM Imran Khan on May 9 last year, which resulted in the death of at least eight people.Khan’s supporters stormed govt buildings and military installations. The military’s statement detailed that the convictions relate primarily to attacks on key military sites, including Jinnah House (the Lahore corps commander’s residence), General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, and a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) base in Mianwali.The sentences were issued by Field General Court Martial as part of the first phase of trials. Supreme Court had earlier conditionally allowed military courts to pronounce verdicts for 85 civilians detained in connection with the riots.The military statement highlighted that the convicts have the right to appeal and other legal recourses as guaranteed by law.The May 9 violence led to the arrest of many politicians and supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party. PTI has denied involvement in the violence. However, govt and military maintain that the attacks were meticulously planned and executed by PTI brass.Khan and his party have called for a judicial probe into the May 9 events, claiming the violence was a “false flag” operation intended to suppress PTI.PTI condemned the military court’s decision. National Assembly leader of opposition Omar Ayub wrote on X: “Military court sentences against civilians rejected. The detainees are civilians and cannot be tried by military courts.” He labelled the process as “kangaroo courts”.PTI’s US chapter criticised the rulings. “Colonels and majors, acting as judges, have sentenced civilians it tried in military courts. These civilians were held for over a year in harsh conditions, with many tortured into giving false confessions,” it posted on X.Amnesty International also denounced the military court’s decision, describing it as “an intimidation tactic, designed to crack down on dissent”.Army’s media wing Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) referred to the protests as “politically provoked violence and arson”. ISPR said further sentences for the remaining accused will be announced once the legal process is completed.",25 civilians have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years.

Authorities respond

At least 17 houses belonging to the Christian Tripura community were allegedly set ablaze on Christmas Eve night at Sarai Union in Lama upazila, Bandarban, reported the Daily Star.The arson attack left the residents, who were away in a nearby village for prayers and Christmas celebrations, homeless and devastated.According to victims, the miscreants targeted the new Tongjhiri Tripura Para, where the community had rebuilt their homes after being displaced several years ago.Locals reported that 17 out of 19 houses in the village were completely gutted, leaving little to salvage.Tongjhiri has long been home to the Tripura community, but residents alleged they were forcibly evicted several years ago and claimed that the land on which they were living, had been leased to the wife of a high-ranking police officer during the Awami League regime.Paisapru Tripura, the head of the community, told the outlet, ""We have been living here for three or four generations. A group of people, identifying themselves as 'SP's men,' evicted us four to five years ago.""The community returned and rebuilt their homes following the fall of the Awami League government.Gungamani Tripura, one of the victims, shared his anguish, ""Our houses have been completely burned to ashes. We could not save anything. Today is supposed to be our happiest day, but this has turned into a nightmare. We demand exemplary punishment for the criminals.""Md Idris, chairman of Sarai Union Parishad, confirmed about the incident, adding that 17 houses were destroyed. Acting Lama Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO), Ruppayan Deb, visited the site and provided initial relief, including a blanket and a sack of rice for each affected family.""I have asked the families to file a written complaint,"" Ruppayan Deb said.

'Political witch hunt': Hasina's son accuses Yunus govt of 'weaponising the judiciary',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/political-witch-hunt-hasinas-son-accuses-yunus-govt-of-weaponising-the-judiciary/articleshow/116648697.cms,"Muhammad Yunus and Sheikh Hasina (File ph

Sanjeeb Wazed , son of ousted Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina , has accused the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government of ""weaponising the judiciary"" to carry out a "" political witch hunt "" against the Awami League leadership.His allegations made in a detailed post on X, came shortly after the Bangladeshi interim government sent a diplomatic note to New Delhi seeking Hasina's extradition .Hasina, 77, has been residing in India since August 5, after fleeing Bangladesh amid massive student-led protests that toppled her 16-year rule. Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has since issued arrest warrants for her and several former cabinet members, citing ""crimes against humanity and genocide.""In his post, Wazed, an IT entrepreneur and former ICT adviser in Hasina's government, condemned the ICT process, describing it as a ""farcical trial"" orchestrated by judges and prosecutors appointed by the unelected Yunus-led regime.He claimed the tribunal was part of a broader effort to persecute Awami League leaders, alleging extrajudicial killings, mass incarcerations, and violent attacks on party activists.""The kangaroo tribunal and subsequent request for extradition come while hundreds of leaders and activists are extrajudicially killed, framed with outrageous charges, and subjected to violent attacks, including looting, vandalism, and arson,"" Wazed wrote.India confirmed receiving the diplomatic communication but refrained from commenting. Under the India-Bangladesh extradition treaty, extradition can be denied for offenses of a ""political character.""Bangladesh's de facto foreign minister Touhid Hossain pointed out that Dhaka seeks Hasina's return to face judicial proceedings.However, Wazed expressed no confidence in the ICT, citing the appointment of chief prosecutor Tajul Islam, whom he accused of spreading misinformation about an alleged Interpol red notice against Hasina.""This is a desperate bid to extradite her and hold a farcical trial to serve the interests of Dr Yunus,"" Wazed alleged, pointing out that the prosecutor later retracted his statement after media exposure.""We reiterate our position that every single incident of human rights violation between July and August need to be investigated in a free and fair manner but the Yunus led regime weaponised the judiciary, and we express no confidence on the justice system,"" he added.Meanwhile, Yunus, who assumed office on August 8, defended the government’s actions. In a national address marking 100 days in power, he confirmed plans to seek Hasina’s extradition, saying, “We must ensure justice in every killing.” Yunus also claimed that over 1,500 people had been killed and nearly 20,000 injured during protests leading to Hasina's ouster.India has expressed growing concerns about attacks on minorities, including Hindus, in neighbouring Bangladesh since the political upheaval. During a recent visit to its capital, Dhaka, foreign secretary Vikram Misri raised these issues, emphasising the safety and welfare of minorities.In response, Hasina has accused the interim government of perpetrating ""genocide"" and failing to protect minority communities.","Sanjeeb Wazed, son of ousted Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina, has accused the interim government of ""weaponising the judiciary"" The interim government has sent a diplomatic note to New Delhi seeking Hasina's extradition.

Sorting fact from fiction as fear engulfs Hindus in B'desh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sorting-fact-from-fiction-as-fear-engulfs-hindus-in-bdesh/articleshow/116644844.cms,"CHATTOGRAM: The reports, often accompanied by grainy footage, are frequent: Hindu temples vandalised and set on fire in Bangladesh, minority Hindus targeted and killed.Many of the attacks are real, with the mob rage serving as a warning of how Bangladesh could spiral into violence in the vacuum opened by the overthrow of Sheikh Hasina last summer. Others are forgeries, pushed by supporters of the ousted PM to discredit Bangladesh's interim govt.Caught between the authentic and the exaggerated, Bangladesh's Hindus, who make up about 9% of a population that is overwhelmingly Muslim, are gripped with fear. ""Smiles are rare, and businesses are struggling,"" said S K Nath Shymal, president of Bangladesh National Hindu Grand Alliance in the coastal city of Chattogram, the centre of some of the worst recent tensions.The NYT visited the sites of many of the reported attacks in Dhaka and in Chattogram, the country's second-largest city. Hindu residents confirmed episodes of vandalism and mob violence, particularly after the arrest of a Hindu monk in Nov and the death of a Muslim lawyer during a protest by the monk's supporters. But they also said the cases of forged or exaggerated information had muddied the real threat to them. Shymal said that all sides were ""exploiting us"".Before now, Islamic extremists were pushed to the margins by Hasina's police state. With her gone and an unelected interim govt in place, extremists have returned more openly. In the political violence that followed her departure, hundreds of people, including several Hindus, were killed. Community leaders said the killings of the Hindus were largely related to their political affiliation, not their religion.But tensions have increased in recent weeks with the arrest of a Hindu monk, Chinmoy Das, who was accused of denigrating Bangladesh's flag as he protested for the protection of Hindus. The monk's supporters gathered at the court in Chattogram during his bail hearing, clashing with police. During the unrest, a Muslim lawyer was hacked to death in unclear circumstances. Since then, mobs have arrived in neighbourhoods where Hindus live, vandalising temples and targeting homes. In court, lawyers for the monk were heckled by other lawyers and stopped from defending him, his team said.On the outskirts of Dhaka, a family-run Hindu temple was vandalised and set on fire in the predawn hours of Dec 7. The owner, Ratan Kumar Ghosh, said the attackers had thrown flammable material into his house, which contains the temple, by removing part of its tin roof. Ghosh expressed regret that the local media had minimised the attack.In Chattogram, the premises of three temples were vandalised recently, their gates and windows smashed with rocks. At another temple in Chattogram, it was clear that a mob attack had taken place, but accounts of the unrest were conflicting. Proloy Chakraborty, a priest, said a mob had vandalised two lion statues outside the temple gate. Titu Das, a nearby shopkeeper, said the mob had also attacked shops. Hasina put out a statement saying a ""temple was burned in Chattogram."" But leaders of the Hindu community in Chattogram rejected those accounts.NYT","Many of the attacks are real, with the mob rage serving as a warning of how Bangladesh could spiral into violence.
