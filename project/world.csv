’Naxal-Maoist Terror Nearly Wiped Out Across India’: PM Modi Hails Police, CRPF, BSF

NEW DELHI: CPI(Maoist) central committee (CC) member in charge of the banned outfit’s Odisha state committee, Ganesh Uike, has criticised his CC colleague Chandranna over his recent surrender before the Telangana police, and claimed that efforts to take the “Naxal movement” forward will continue notwithstanding the reverses over the last two years.Uike also disowned Chandranna’s claim that politburo member Devji had been chosen to succeed Basavraj as CPI(Maoist) general secretary. “This is a white lie since the central committee has not met even since general secretary Basavraj was neutralised. With the Central on an offensive against us, the conditions are still not conducive to hold a CC meeting,” Uike said in a statement issued on behalf of the CPI(Maoist) Odisha state committee.Stating that the “protracted people’s war” has encountered many hardships, including the current impasse, Uike claimed the party was trying to contain its losses and move forward. “The ‘party’ will continue to take the Naxal movement forward,” he stated.Chhattisgarh police officials, who are still verifying the authenticity of the Odisha state committee’s statement, said that if true, it concedes defeat and highlights the growing frustration and deep crisis/chasm within the Maoist ranks.“After the recent surrender of politburo member Sonu and CC members Rupesh and Chandranna, the Maoist leadership is shaken. To save face, it is resorting to falsehoods and hollow rhetoric about ‘continuing the revolution’. These empty words can no longer disguise the truth — that the outfit is in complete disarray, morally bankrupt and strategically cornered across all affected states,” Bastar range IGP P Sunderraj told TOI.“The Maoist leadership’s attempt to brand committed cadres who chose peace as ‘traitors’ only reveals their insecurity and helplessness. The latest statement, if authentic, exposes that Devji no longer enjoys authority even within the fragmented and weakened Maoist outfit,” he added."," CPI(Maoist) central committee (CC) member in charge of the banned outfit’s Odisha state committee, Ganesh Uike, has criticised his CC colleague Chandranna over his recent surrender before the Telangana police. “The ‘party’ will continue to take the Naxal movement forward,” he stated.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124982403,imgsize-445550,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"
India-US trade deal soon?

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday hinted that Washington could soon reach a trade deal with India, emphasising that the two countries have strong bilateral ties.“If you look at India and Pakistan, so I'm doing a trade deal with India, and I have great respect and love. As you know, for Prime Minister Modi, we have a great relationship,” Trump said while speaking at a luncheon for APEC CEOs.Addressing business leaders, Trump revisited events from earlier this year and claimed he intervened to halt escalating tensions between India and Pakistan.According to him, his refusal to move ahead with a trade deal and the threat of punitive tariffs, prevented what he described as a looming conflict.“And I called Prime Minister Modi. I said, we can't make a trade deal with you. No, no, we must make a trade deal. I said, no, we can't. You're starting a war with Pakistan. We're not going to do it. And then I called Pakistan.”He went on to elaborate that he warned both nations of severe economic consequences if they continued hostilities.“And to be warned for the tariffs, I said I was going to put 250% tariffs on each country, which means that you'll never do business.In other words, there's nothing you can sell for 250%.”He further added, “That means that's a nice way of saying we don't want to do business with you. You don't have to say that because that's a nasty we don't want to do business. You say, we're going to put two hundred and fifty percent tariffs if you don't stop the war.”Trump has repeatedly claimed that his intervention prevented the war, claiming the threat of refusing trade deals forced India and Pakistan to step back.India, however, has maintained that the United States had no involvement in de-escalation efforts. According to New Delhi, the decision to cease hostilities was taken after a request from the Pakistani DGMO to his Indian counterpart.Trade relations between the US and India have been under strain in recent months. Washington imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods in response to India’s continued purchase of Russian oil, arguing that the imports were “helping to power Russia’s war machine.” Now, Indian imports to the US market are now subject to a 50% tariff.Earlier this week, EAM S Jaishankar also had a meeting with US secretary of state Marco Rubio in Kuala Lumpur to discuss international relations and ongoing trade negotiations between their nations.",US President Donald Trump hinted that Washington could soon reach a trade deal with India.

Mumbai hostage scare: What accused Rohit Arya said in chilling video — his demands & motive revealed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mumbai-hostage-scare-what-accused-rohit-arya-said-in-chilling-video-his-demands-motive-revealed/articleshow/124960555.cms,"What Arya said in the chilling video



The story behind



NEW DELHI: A scary hostage situation unfolded in Mumbai's Powai on Thursday, as 50-year-old Rohit Arya held 17 children and two adults captive inside a studio, claiming he only wanted to ""have a conversation"" with certain people. Arya was shot when he allegedly tried to harm the children with an air gun and later died in hospital, officials said.Before the police entered the studio, Arya posted a video that circulated widely online in which he explained why he had taken the children and set out what he called his demands.In the viral clip, Arya introduced himself and explained his plan in calm, measured terms. He began by saying he had chosen hostage-taking over suicide and framed his action as a means to demand answers:""I am Rohit Arya. Instead of (committing) suicide, I made a plan and have taken a few children hostage....I have very simple demands. Very moral, ethical demands. I have some questions. I want to speak to some people and on their answers, if there are any counter-questions, I want to ask them. But I want these answers. I do not want anything else. I am not a terrorist, nor do I have any demand of money. Want to make simple conversations. ""He warned of consequences if provoked and insisted his motive was to force public answers: ""I want simple conversations, and that's why I've taken these children hostage.I've held them hostage as part of a plan. If I live, I'll do it. If I die, someone else will, but it will definitely happen. It will happen to these children if they don't suffer any harm.""He also threatened an extreme response to any ""wrong move"" : ""The slightest wrong move from your end will trigger me to set this whole place on fire and die in it. Whether I die or not, the children will be unnecessarily hurt and traumatised definitely.""Arya denied responsibility for any harm should it occur and framed himself as a person seeking talk-based solutions: ""If something happens to them, I shouldn't be held responsible for it. Those who are unnecessarily triggering me should be held responsible, cause a normal person just wants to talk.""""I am going to provide a solution just by talking. Please don't trigger me to do some harm to anybody,"" he added.According to Mumbai Police , Rohit Arya had called several children including boys and girls around 15 years old to R A Studio in Powai’s Mahavir Classic building for what he claimed was an audition for a web series. The auditions had reportedly been taking place for the past two days.The situation turned grim around 1:30 pm on Thursday, when Powai police received a distress call about a man holding several people hostage inside the studio. A massive response followed — teams from the Quick Response Team (QRT), the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad, and the fire brigade immediately rushed to the scene.""At about 1.30 pm, Powai police station received information that a person had taken 17 children hostage at Mahavir Classic building. The Mumbai Police team conducted a rescue operation and safely freed all the children. During the operation, while rescuing the children, the person got injured, was immediately rushed to the hospital and later declared dead,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police Datta Nalawade told PTI.Nalawade said the police initially tried to negotiate with Arya but were forced to act when talks failed. ""It was a challenging operation, because we were negotiating with him without any positive outcome. To save the children’s lives was our priority,"" he added.To reach the hostages, the police entered the studio through a bathroom window using a ladder provided by the fire brigade. In the operation, 17 children, a senior citizen, and another man were safely rescued.Officials said Arya was carrying an air gun and some chemicals. While police initially did not confirm that any firing took place during the rescue, Arya was declared dead at 5:15 pm at the hospital.Andheri MLA Murji Patel later visited the rescued children at Seven Hills Hospital. He said, ""I met the children at the hospital they were safe."" As per reports Arya had been shooting with the group for five days and had not appeared to threaten or intimidate them before Thursday’s incident.","Rohit Arya, 50, held 17 children and two adults captive inside a studio in Mumbai.

India backs Turkiye rival Cyprus





NEW DELHI: India backed Afghanistan's announcement that it will build a dam on the Kunar river, saying it stands ready to support Afghanistan in sustainable water management, including on hydroelectric projects. Amidst Afghanistan-Pakistan tensions, the govt also reiterated its position that it is fully committed to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan.On the dam issue, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said there's a history of cooperation between India and Afghanistan on such issues, including the Salma Dam in Herat province.Afghanistan last week announced plans to begin construction of a dam on the Kunar river that flows into Pakistan's northwestern region, raising concerns in Islamabad about likely restriction on the flow of water into the country. Pakistan is faced with similar concerns emanating from India's decision to put in abeyance the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, a Word Bank-brokered water sharing agreement between the two countries, after the Pahalgam terrorist attack.""Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories. Pakistan seems to think that it has the right to practice cross-border terrorism with impunity.Its neighbors find it unacceptable.

In a meeting with his visiting counterpart Constantinos Kombos, the minister also appreciated Cyprus’s consistent support on issues of core interest to India, especially in the battle against cross-border terrorism and India’s bid to become a permanent member of the security council.","Afghanistan last week announced plans to begin construction of a dam on the Kunar river that flows into Pakistan's northwestern region.

'Police's response was measured, safety of those held captive was priority'





MUMBAI: A 45-year-old documentary filmmaker from Pune held 17 children, aged 12-15, a 75-year-old woman and his staffer hostage for two hours at a recording studio in Powai Thursday afternoon after calling them for auditions for a web series. The crisis ended after a police commando team stormed the studio following failed negotiations and shot him in the chest purportedly in self-defence after he fired from an air gun. He was declared dead in hospital.The hostage drama played out after the captor, Rohit Aarrya, who had been living in a relative's flat in Chembur for the past few days, released a video saying he wanted ""simple answers"" to some questions and threatened to set the place ablaze if there was any move made to challenge him. In the clip, which was circulated to many media outlets, he said he was not a terrorist and only wanted ""to be heard"". ""Instead of dying by suicide, I have held some children hostage,"" he said.Police officials said they spent nearly two hours trying to negotiate with Aarrya and gauge his demands, but he refused to cooperate, even after one of the girls' parents said she suffered from seizures.An official said Rohit Aarrya appeared calm when police spoke to him, but at no stage did he elaborate on his motives.City police commissioner Deven Bharti maintained that Aarrya fired first, prompting retaliatory police firing. ""Regardless of his demands, we couldn't let him play with lives. He fired first at police. Our team fired back in self-defence. There was no other option."" Other officials reiterated that the safety of those held captive was the top priority, adding that the police team's response was measured and as per the protocol.The death prompted calls by legal experts for a magisterial inquiry, as laid down by law, to verify the claim of retaliatory police firing.While Aarrya did not elaborate on his motive in the video or during police's attempts at negotiations, it emerged that Aarrya had sat on a hunger strike against former school education minister Deepak Kesarkar of Shiv Sena in 2024 over alleged dues of Rs 2 crore for a state-sanctioned school cleanliness project. Kesarkar said he personally gave him some money as a ""gesture of sympathy"" even though the school education department maintained that Aarrya had collected payment directly from some children. He said Aarrya should have taken up the issue with the department instead of holding children hostage.The city crime branch took over the probe. Those rescued were taken to SevenHills Hospital for medical examination.","Rohit Aarrya, 45, held 17 children, aged 12-15, a 75-year-old woman and his staffer hostage for two hours at a recording studio in Powai.

The bench instead held the four guilty under the Arms Act.The family of one of the slain CRPF constables reacted with anger. ""How can terrorists who killed so many security personnel with automatic weapons be acquitted? It's unbelievable. I lost my father, and now the killers walk free. Is this justice?"" asked Deepa Chaudhary (26), daughter of CRPF constable Manveer Singh (35), who was among those killed in the 2007 attack.Allahabad HC bench noted in the verdict that the ""case would have met a different result had the investigation and prosecution been conducted by more trained police"".The court cited the prosecution's ""failure to prove beyond reasonable doubt"" their culpability in the crime. Justices Siddhartha Varma and Ram Manohar Narayan Mishra acknowledged the ""magnitude"" of the terrorist attack on the CRPF camp on the night of Dec 31, 2007, but said they were ""constrained"" by prosecutorial failure to overturn the death sentence pronounced by a trial court in 2019 against Mohd Sharif, Sabauddin, Imran Shahjad and Md Farooq under sections 302 and 149 of IPC.The bench instead held the four guilty under Section 25 (1-A) of the Arms Act, based on the seizure of AK-47 rifles from them, and sentenced them to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs 1 lakh each. A fifth convict serving a life sentence in the case - Jang Bahadur Khan, alias Baba - was acquitted of terrorism charges and convicted for illegal possession of weapons.""The period of imprisonment undergone by the appellants will be adjusted towards the above sentence awarded to them,"" states the order. While observing that it could not deny that the CRPF camp was attacked, ""the defect in investigation ultimately culminated in the acquittal of the accused persons"".""Proving the principal offence beyond reasonable doubt is a golden rule that runs through the web of criminal jurisprudence.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police on Thursday opposed the bail pleas of activists Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and others in the Supreme Court in the UAPA case linked to the alleged conspiracy behind the February 2020 Delhi riots, claiming they conspired to strike at the country’s sovereignty and integrity through a “regime change operation” disguised as a peaceful protest.The police said the offences were part of a deliberate attempt to destabilise the state, warranting “jail and not bail,” news agency PTI reported quoting an affidavit filed before the top court. The agency said it had collected ocular, documentary and technical evidence showing the accused’s “deep-rooted complicity” in allegedly engineering riots across the country on communal lines.The bail pleas of Khalid, Imam, Gulfisha Fatima and Meeran Haider, all booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, are scheduled to be heard on Friday by a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and NV Anjaria.According to the affidavit, the alleged conspiracy aimed to disrupt communal harmony and instigate crowds “to the extent of armed rebellion.” The police also said the accused planned to escalate tensions during the visit of US President Donald Trump, in order to attract international media attention and portray the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests as a global issue.""The materials on record, including chats referencing President Trump, establish that the conspiracy was pre-planned to coincide with his visit,” the affidavit stated, adding that the CAA was used as a “radicalising catalyst” camouflaged as a peaceful movement.The police further alleged that the accused have delayed and obstructed the trial, calling their conduct a ""brazen abuse of process."" It said the argument that there are more than 900 witnesses was misleading, asserting that only 100–150 witnesses are material to the case and can be examined swiftly if the accused cooperate.","Delhi Police oppose bail pleas of Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam, Gulfisha Fatima and Meeran Haider.

Chirag Paswan Accuses Owaisi of Dividing Muslims Through Fear Politics

Tejashwi avoids reaction to Owaisi

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has increased his attack on the opposition Mahagathbandhan, questioning why the alliance has not named any Muslim leader as its deputy chief minister face for the Bihar elections Addressing supporters, Owaisi said, ""Sitting next to Tejashwi Yadav, Mukesh Bhai of the VIP Party, confident in his community's history, declared that the Malla community is with Tejashwi. The Malla community represents 3% of Bihar's population. He declared that if they gain power, he will become the deputy CM... If a Malla's son will become the deputy chief minister, what will the 17% minority community in Bihar do? Are they only to spread 'Dari ' (carpet)?""He added, ""If a Malla's son can become the deputy chief minister, then Mohammad's son can also become the Prime Minister or chief minister. Nothing can stop us from achieving our goals. Remember, the more you dream, the more you trust in Allah's will, and the more you strive along the way, the more you will see the clearer the path will become.""On Tuesday, Owaisi had raised a similar question. He said, ""Why cannot a Muslim, who represents 17 per cent of the state's population, become the chief minister? After all, they seem to have no problem with promising the deputy CM's post to a person who represents only three per cent of the population.""He criticised Congress, RJD and Samajwadi Party, saying these parties seek Muslim votes without offering leadership roles. Owaisi said, ""Parties like Congress, RJD and Samajwadi Party seek votes of Muslims, cashing in on the minority community's fear of the BJP. These parties have not been able to stop the BJP but are still trying to get the votes of Muslims under the same pretext.""He also targeted the BJP. Owaisi said, ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi claims to take all along and strive to work for the progress of all. But his party fails to give tickets, in elections, to a single Muslim.""RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav declined to respond to Owaisi’s remarks. When asked, he said, ""Leave it. What can I say about it?"" Tejashwi is the Mahagathbandhan’s declared chief minister candidate.In the previous assembly elections, AIMIM contested 19 seats and won five, though four of its MLAs later moved to the RJD.In the 2020 Bihar Assembly elections, AIMIM contested 20 seats and won five, all from the Seemanchal belt. Seemanchal includes Araria, Katihar, Kishanganj and Purnia, located close to the West Bengal border. The Muslim population in Bihar is around 17.7%, and Muslims form about 40% of the population in at least 11 constituencies. They have a decisive influence on around 47 seats.The four districts of Kishanganj, Araria, Purnia and Katihar have 24 seats that will go to polls in the second phase. These districts have a high Muslim population. For many years, this region was seen as a strong area for the RJD and Congress. Owaisi first contested here in 2015 but did not win.Before the 2020 elections, AIMIM won a bypoll seat in Kishanganj. In 2020, the party won five seats — two each in Kishanganj and Purnia, and one in Araria. This changed the electoral maths in multiple seats, reducing the RJD-Congress vote share. The NDA finally defeated the Opposition by a slim margin, where a difference of only 12,000 votes separated the two sides in the final seat tally.The Mahagathbandhan released its manifesto on Tuesday, titled 'Bihar Ka Tejashwi Pran'. It promises that within 20 days of forming the government, a law will be passed to give one government job per family.The 2025 Bihar assembly elections will take place between the National Democratic Alliance (BJP, JD-U, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and Rashtriya Lok Morcha) and the Mahagathbandhan (RJD, Congress, CPI-ML, CPI, CPM and VIP).Polling will be held in two phases, on November 6 and 11. Counting of votes will take place on November 14.","AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has increased his attack on the opposition Mahagathbandhan.

A bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kumar allowed his appeal and directed the Maharashtra home secretary ""to constitute an SIT, comprising senior police officers from both Hindu and Muslim communities, to undertake an investigation into all the allegations made by the appellant by registering an FIR in connection with the assault upon him on May 13, 2023, and take appropriate action thereon as warranted."" It also asked the state to take disciplinary action against the erring police officers for laxity and dereliction of duty.Maharashtra sought a open court hearing and said it will implement SC's order and set up the SIT for fresh probe into the incident. However, it expressed strong reservation claiming ""it is inconsistent with the secular character of Bharat and the foundational principles governing public institutions"".""It is a settled constitutional position that once an officer dons the uniform of the police force, he or she is bound by the duties of neutrality, impartiality, and lawful action. A police officer has no religion, no caste, no political affiliation, only a solemn duty to uphold the rule of law, discharge public functions with impartiality, and maintain public order with integrity,"" the Devendra Fadnavis-led govt said.""By directing a religiously segregated composition of the SIT, the judgment inadvertently undermines the integrity and neutrality of the police force. It risks setting a precedent whereby religious identity may be factored into official administrative composition, thereby compromising the very secular character of the Constitution,"" the state said.""Further, such a direction casts aspersions on officers of the state on communal lines without affording them a hearing or considering their service record, and thereby violates the principles of justice and trust in public administration,"" it said, adding that the purpose of the review petition is solely intended to ""preserve the constitutional ethos of secular administration and to avoid potential long-term consequences arising from this direction"".","One Mohd Afzal Mohd Sharif had claimed that he witnessed the murder of a Hindu, who was driving an auto-rickshaw owned by a Muslim.

Bengaluru Road Rage Horror: Delivery Boy Chased, Crushed To Death By Martial Arts Trainer Couple

Victim Darshan

The accused, Manoj Kumar (32), a martial arts trainer from Kerala, and his wife Aarati Sharma (30)





BENGALURU: A chilling CCTV footage has emerged showing a Kalaripayattu trainer and his wife deliberately mowing down a 24-year-old food delivery agent in a fit of rage — and returning to the crime scene later to collect broken car parts.Police have arrested Manoj Kumar (32), a martial arts trainer from Kerala, and his wife Aarati Sharma (30), from Jammu & Kashmir, in connection with the October 25 incident that killed Darshan, a resident of Kembattalli.The couple, married for five years, has been remanded to 14-day judicial custody.The CCTV footage, accessed by police from Nataraja Layout in South Bengaluru, has revealed the sequence of events that turned a minor brush on the road into a murder.Also read: Delivery boy chased, crushed after road rage spat; martial arts trainer, wife arrested for murder Around 9pm, Darshan’s gearless scooter accidentally brushed against Kumar’s car, slightly damaging its right-side rear-view mirror. Though Darshan apologised and sped away — as he was on his way to deliver food — Kumar allegedly lost his temper.“Losing control of himself, he took a U-turn, chased the scooter, and rammed it from behind,” said a senior investigating officer. “The impact threw Darshan and his pillion rider Varun onto the road.The car didn’t stop.”Locals rushed the duo to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared Darshan brought dead. His sister later filed a hit-and-run case with JP Nagar traffic police.But when investigators examined the CCTV footage, they were stunned. “To our horror, we discovered it was not an accident. The driver deliberately veered left and rammed into the scooter,” a senior officer said.Further footage showed the same car returning to the accident site around 9.40pm. “The couple, wearing masks, parked nearby and collected parts of their car that had broken off during the impact. As they left again, CCTV cameras captured their faces clearly,” the officer added.The footage helped police identify the car and trace the couple to their residence. Deputy commissioner of police (South) Lokesh Jagalasar confirmed the arrests, saying, “The accused have confessed to their involvement.”While Manoj claimed he was alone during the ramming and that Aarati had only accompanied him later to retrieve the car parts, police said they are verifying his version.Darshan, a bachelor, is survived by his parents and sister. His family is demanding strict action against the accused.","Police have arrested Manoj Kumar (32), a martial arts trainer from Kerala, and his wife Aarati Sharma (30), from Jammu & Kashmir, in connection with the October 25 incident.

Did Erika Kirk really turn down Taylor Swift’s $60 million offer to join Super Bowl’s rival All-American Halftime Show?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/did-erika-kirk-really-turn-down-taylor-swifts-60-million-offer-to-join-super-bowls-rival-all-american-halftime-show/articleshow/124975330.cms,"A viral social media post falsely claimed Taylor Swift offered Erika Kirk sixty million dollars to perform at a Turning Point USA event. Fact-checking reveals no evidence of this offer. The story gained traction online, fueling political debates. Turning Point USA announced its own faith-based halftime show. This incident highlights how misinformation spreads rapidly online.

Viral Facebook post ignites controversy and political speculation

What is the All-American Halftime Show and why is Taylor Swift being linked to it?



A viral Facebook post has taken the internet by storm, claiming that Erika Kirk, widow of Turning Point USA (TPUSA) founder Charlie Kirk, rejected a jaw-dropping $60 million offer from pop icon Taylor Swift to perform at the conservative group’s upcoming All-American Halftime Show. But while the claim has fueled political and cultural debates online, fact-checking reveals that the story is entirely baseless.The rumor began when a Facebook page named Lab Bar alleged that Swift approached Erika Kirk with a multimillion-dollar proposal to appear at TPUSA’s halftime event. The post painted Kirk’s supposed refusal as a “cultural stand,” praising her for “refusing to sell out to Hollywood.”Soon, the claim exploded across social media. Thousands of users shared it with comments applauding Kirk for showing “morality and values,” turning an unverified rumor into a trending talking point. Others used it to frame a broader cultural divide between conservative movements and mainstream entertainment, with Taylor Swift’s name once again pulled into political crossfire.However, investigations quickly found no credible evidence supporting the story. Neither Taylor Swift, TPUSA, nor Erika Kirk have addressed or confirmed the claim. Major outlets and official TPUSA channels have remained silent, and no trace of any such negotiation exists in legitimate sources.The rumor’s origin, an unverified Facebook post, is consistent with a classic case of misinformation that thrives on social polarization.Turning Point USA announced The All-American Halftime Show in October as a faith-based alternative to the Super Bowl halftime show, which this year will feature Bad Bunny. The event, part of TPUSA’s outreach strategy, aims to showcase performers aligned with traditional and faith-centered values.Erika Kirk, who now leads several of TPUSA’s public initiatives following her husband’s passing, remains committed to his legacy. Speaking recently at a university event, she recalled, “Charlie always said he had no money, no connections, and no idea what he was doing, but he obeyed the Lord and built something that mattered.”Despite her public visibility, Kirk has never mentioned Swift or the alleged offer, underscoring that the viral story was nothing more than a digital fabrication amplified by social media outrage.In reality, neither Taylor Swift nor Erika Kirk is at the center of a $60 million clash of values, just another example of how misinformation can turn fiction into trending “news.”Also Read: Plans for kids already in motion as Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce plan their 2026 nuptials","A viral social media post falsely claimed Taylor Swift offered Erika Kirk sixty million dollars to perform at a Turning Point USA event.

Penélope’s glam gang life with guns and drugs ends in Brazil’s biggest police operation





A Rio de Janeiro influencer known as Penélope, or Japinha do CV, was shot dead during Brazil’s deadliest-ever police raid. Police said the 20-something woman was killed by a rifle shot to the face on Tuesday, October 28, 2025, during a major operation in Complexo do Alemão and Complexo da Penha favelas, areas run by the Comando Vermelho (Red Command) gang. Officials said 121 people died, including four police officers, in the raid called Operation Containment. The mission involved 2,500 police officers and was aimed at stopping the gang’s control in Rio.Penélope became famous on Instagram for posting pictures with rifles, drugs, and military vests. She had over 50,000 followers and was often called the “Muse of Crime.” Police said she helped guard escape routes and protect drug sale points for the Red Command gang in north Rio.At the time of her death, she was dressed in camouflage clothes, wearing a tactical vest and carrying rifle magazines. Her body was found near the main entrance of the favela after hours of heavy gunfire.Police said she resisted arrest and opened fire before being shot. Her Instagram account was deleted after her death.The huge raid was led by Rio’s Civil and Military Police, using armored trucks and helicopters. Officials said the goal was to break the gang’s base and stop its expansion.Brazil’s Justice Minister Ricardo Lewandowski said the raid was planned by Rio’s state police without federal help.

‘Pak Is Infuriated With…’: MEA Slams Pakistan Over Border Tensions With Afghanistan





Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) second-in-command Amjad, a key figure in the banned militant group, was killed along with three other militants when security forces foiled an infiltration attempt from Afghanistan into Pakistan, the army said on Thursday.According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), cited by PTI, the militants tried to cross the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Bajaur district on Wednesday night when their movement was detected.“The troops effectively engaged and thwarted the militants' attempt to infiltrate,” the statement said, adding that four militants, including high-value target Amjad alias Mazahim, were “sent to hell.”Amjad, who served as deputy to TTP chief Noor Wali and headed the group’s Rehbari Shura, was among Pakistan’s most wanted militants, carrying a bounty of Rs five million. The ISPR said he was “actively involved in perpetuating numerous terrorist activities inside Pakistan while residing in Afghanistan.”The army also urged the interim Afghan government to take “concrete measures to ensure that Afghan soil is not used by militants to perpetrate terrorism against Pakistan.”Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lauded the security forces for eliminating the TTP commander and his aides. Prime Minister Shehbaz said the security forces, through their professional expertise, eliminated the highly wanted TTP commander Amjad and thwarted “the nefarious designs of the enemies of Pakistan's sovereignty.” He added, “We will continue to defeat the elements that harm innocent people. ”The operation in Bajaur came a day after six Pakistani soldiers, including a captain, were martyred during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district, where seven terrorists were also gunned down.Formed in 2007 as an umbrella organisation of several militant outfits, the TTP seeks to impose its strict version of Islam across Pakistan. The group, believed to have close ties with al-Qaeda, has claimed responsibility for numerous deadly attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad and the 2009 assault on army headquarters.","Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) second-in-command Amjad, a key figure in the banned militant group, was killed along with three other militants.

'US behind China but will catch up': Scott Bessent after Trump orders resumption of nuclear weapons testing; move follows Russia's trials,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-behind-china-but-will-catch-up-scott-bessent-after-trump-orders-resumption-of-nuclear-weapons-testing-move-follows-russias-trials/articleshow/124951472.cms,"‘Rare Earths Dispute Settled’: Trump Drops Big China Trade Bombshell Aboard Air Force One

Trump’s surprise before meeting Xi



'With others doing testing, it’s appropriate we do too'



China, Russia react sharply



Experts warn of dangerous escalation



Race among nuclear powers



Peace talk or power play?







US treasury secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday defended President Donald Trump’s decision to immediately resume nuclear weapons testing for the first time in 33 years, saying it was crucial to help America ""certainly catch up"" with China.""The US is lagging China in nuclear power development, but we can certainly catch up,"" Bessent said during an interview on Fox Business’s Mornings with Maria. ""It’s all hands on deck for nuclear power,"" he added.Bessent’s remarks came hours after Trump ordered the Pentagon to immediately restart nuclear weapons testing, ending a moratorium that had been in place since 1992.The announcement was made minutes before Trump met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, and was widely seen as a show of strength ahead of high-stakes trade talks between Washington and Beijing.Bessent also pointed to what he described as a major trade win from the Xi-Trump meeting. ""Trump got China to buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans this season,"" he said.""Between now and January, the total will rise — and then for the next three years, they’re going to be buying a minimum of 25 million metric tons per annum,"" he added.Trump made the announcement on Truth Social while aboard Marine One en route to his meeting with Xi at Gimhae Air Base.""Because of other countries’ testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately,"" Trump posted.He added that ""Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.”The move followed Russia’s successful tests of its nuclear-powered Poseidon torpedo and cruise missile earlier this month, and weapons that President Vladimir Putin hailed as next-generation deterrents.Later, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said the testing was necessary to ensure US readiness and parity with rival powers.""With others doing testing, I think it's appropriate that we do also,"" he said, adding that specific test sites would be ""determined later,"" Reuters reported.When asked about the risks of escalating a new nuclear arms race, Trump brushed aside concerns. ""I'd like to see a denuclearisation because we have so many and Russia's second and China's third and China will catch up within four or five years,"" he said""We are actually talking to Russia about that, and China would be added to that if we do something,"" he added.Russia’s state-run RIA news agency quoted a senior lawmaker as saying Trump’s decision would usher in ""a new era of unpredictability and open confrontation.""Beijing’s foreign ministry called on Washington to ""honor its commitments"" under international treaties, referring to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), signed by the US but never ratified.Trump’s announcement drew immediate criticism from arms control experts, who called the move unnecessary and provocative. ""The United States has no technical, military, or political reason to resume nuclear explosive testing,"" said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association.He noted that the NNSA ""would need at least 36 months to resume contained nuclear tests underground at the former test site in Nevada,"" adding that much of its workforce remains furloughed due to the ongoing government shutdown.Kimball warned that resuming testing could trigger a dangerous arms race and undermine decades of nuclear restraint. ""Restarting tests could invite reciprocal actions from Russia or China and unravel global nonproliferation efforts,"" he said.Trump’s decision comes just days after Russia announced it had successfully tested two advanced nuclear systems, the Poseidon nuclear-powered torpedo and a nuclear-powered cruise missile — moves that the Kremlin said demonstrated its ""technological superiority.”While Trump cited these developments as justification for restarting US testing, analysts say the US already maintains the world’s most advanced and reliable nuclear arsenal.Independent experts estimate that the US possesses around 3,700 nuclear warheads, compared to Russia’s 4,300 and China’s 500–600, though Beijing is rapidly expanding its arsenal. The Pentagon has projected that China could surpass 1,000 warheads by 2030, a figure still far behind Washington and Moscow.Trump, however, has repeatedly claimed that the United States has ""the world’s largest stockpile of nuclear weapons.”Analysts say Trump’s announcement, coming moments before his trade meeting with Xi, was intended as both a negotiating tool and a demonstration of US dominance.""If the United States indeed begins developing similar nuclear delivery technologies, there is a significant chance that Beijing would follow suit,"" Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace told Washington Post.""Continued Russian progress and parallel US development could further incentivize China to accelerate its own research programs to avoid being left behind,"" Zhao added.Trump later described his meeting with Xi as ""very friendly,"" saying he agreed to visit China in April 2026, with Xi expected to visit the US later next year.","US treasury secretary Scott Bessent defended President Donald Trump’s decision to immediately resume nuclear weapons testing for the first time in 33 years.

JD Vance converted to Catholicism in August 2019, long after JD Vance's marriage to Usha Vance.It was a major MAGA implosion moment as social media users started 'shipping' JD Vance with Erika Kirk, widow of Charlie Kirk -- politically and also romantically.A few weeks ago, MAGA commentators floated the idea of a Vance-Kirk ticket for 2028 -- JD Vance being the presidential candidate and Erika Kirk, the VP candidate. JD Vance is currently the top choice for the 2028 presidential candidate, apart from Marco Rubio. But in the past few weeks, support for Vance-Kirk grew louder for Vance-Rubio. But after Vance addressed the Turning Point USA event at the University of Mississippi, the chatter took a different turn and many MAGA supporters insinuated that JD Vance will divorce Usha Vance and will remarry Erika Kirk before his 2028 run because they argued that JD Vance knows America will not accept a 'Hindu First Lady'.The photo of Erika Kirk and JD Vance hugging invited criticism for Erika Kirk as well as she was accused of cosying up with JD Vance on the stage.Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki recently made some comments about JD Vance and his relationship with Usha Vance saying that Usha is scared of him. ""I think the little Manchurian candidate, JD Vance, wants to be president more than anything else,"" Psaki said. ""I always wonder what's going on in the mind of his wife. Like, are you OK? Please blink four times. We'll come over here. We'll save you,"" Jen Psaki said.""And that he's willing to do anything to get there. And your whole iteration you just outlined, I mean, he's scarier in certain ways in some ways. And he's young and ambitious and agile in the sense that he's a chameleon who makes himself whatever he thinks the audience wants to hear from him,"" Psaki said.JD Vance said the comments are disgraceful, but the Second Lady can speak for herself. ""I am very lucky to have a wonderful wife. I hope that my wife feels the same about me. We will keep on serving the country together,"" JD Vance recently said when he was in Israel with his wife.","JD Vance converted to Catholicism in August 2019, long after JD Vance's marriage to Usha Vance.

FBI's Kash Patel Announces BIG Arrests: NBA Gambling Ring Bust, Terry Rozier, Billups Arrested





FBI director Kash Patel has been accused of using an FBI jet to attend girlfriend Alexis Wilkins ' performance at a pro-wrestling event on Saturday. The accusation came from Kyle Seraphin, a MAGA former FBI agent-turned-critic podcaster. “We’re in the middle of government shutdown where they’re not even gonna pay all of the employees that work for the agency that this guy heads,” Seraphin said on his podcast. “And this guy is jetting off to hang out with his girlfriend in Nashville on our dime?”“He flew a $60 million aircraft to go hang out there. Is that gross to anybody else?” he said.The FBI did not comment on it and Patel has also not issued any statement on the accusation.Seraphin claimed that a government jet took off from a northern Virginia airport, then landed at State College, Pennsylvania’s regional airport near the campus, right around the time Patel was headed there. The jet is registered with the FAA as government-owned, with its owner’s address as the FBI’s Washington headquarters, Seraphin claimed, adding that the jet's travel list earlier this week matches that of Patel's as the jet traveled from Washington to Philadelphia, matching with Patel's appearance at a press conference there.FBI directors have to pay the price of a commercial coach ticket if they use their government planes for their private use.Kash Patel once called for ending former FBI director Christopher Wray's use of the government's fleet of private aircraft for personal travel. The FBI should ""ground Chris Wray's private jet that he pays for with taxpayer dollars to hop around the country,"" Patel said during his ""Kash's Corner"" podcast in 2023.This is not the first time Patel's use of an FBI jet has come to light. Senate Democrats earlier asked the US Government Accountability Office to review Patel's personal travel on government aircraft.","FBI director Kash Patel has been accused of using an FBI jet to attend girlfriend Alexis Wilkins'performance at a pro-wrestling event on Saturday.

Britain’s King Charles has taken the extraordinary step of stripping his younger brother, Prince Andrew, of all his remaining titles and honours and ordering him to vacate his Windsor residence, Buckingham Palace announced on Thursday.The decision came after weeks of pressure on the palace. Earlier this month, Andrew gave up using the title Duke of York because of renewed attention on his friendship with the late sex offender and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The King has now gone a step further by removing the title of “prince,” which Andrew has had since he was born to the late Queen Elizabeth II.In a statement, the palace said that Andrew would no longer be known as a prince, but instead by his full name, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. It also confirmed that a formal notice had been served requiring him to surrender the lease of his mansion, Royal Lodge, within the Windsor Castle grounds. The Duke will be moved to alternative private accommodation.“These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” the palace said. “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse,"" it added.""The announcement comes as new reports have deepened the row surrounding the 65-year-old royal. BBC investigations recently confirmed that Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein were hosted at Royal Lodge during Princess Beatrice’s 18th birthday celebrations in 2006. The revelation is a major one because Epstein was already facing a US arrest warrant for sexual assault at the time.Epstein and Weinstein reportedly attended a small gathering on the lawn before joining the larger party at Windsor Castle. A photograph reportedly matched the trio to the Royal Lodge garden. Andrew has not commented on the claims.The Duke has been under fire for years over his friendship with Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking. Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence in the United States for helping Epstein procure underage girls, while Weinstein has been convicted of multiple sexual assaults.Andrew stepped back from royal duties in 2019 after a disastrous BBC interview in which he defended his relationship with Epstein. He later settled a civil sexual assault case brought by Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of abusing her when she was a minor, though he continues to deny all allegations.","King Charles strips Prince Andrew of all his remaining titles and honours.

Michael J. Knowles brings up HasanAbi’s old remarks in Senate hearing

HasanAbi’s CollarGate controversy also mentioned by Michael J. Knowles





Political commentator and Twitch streamer Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker’s old remarks were brought up during a US Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing on October 29, 2025. Conservative media host Michael J. Knowles mentioned HasanAbi’s viral 2025 comments about capitalism while discussing political violence in America. Knowles told senators that Hasan once said things like, “Kill them! Kill those motherf**kers! Let the streets soak in their red capitalist blood.” These comments had gone viral in September 2025 and sparked backlash from public figures like Elon Musk, who accused Hasan of inciting violence.During the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Michael J. Knowles used HasanAbi’s past statements to highlight what he called an “ideological problem on the left.”He reminded the committee that Hasan Piker had earlier made violent remarks about property owners and conservatives. Knowles said those remarks were resurfacing after the murder of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk.He said, “The New York Times reacted by publishing the assassination-related musings of Hasan Piker, a prominent left-wing streamer, who has suggested the assassination of Senator Tom Cotton and said, ‘Kill those motherf**kers in the streets!’”Michael J. Knowles told senators that such comments, even if meant as satire, show how far violent political talk has spread online.He argued that these examples prove that “violence is being normalized” in America’s online political spaces.Michael J. Knowles also brought up the recent “CollarGate” controversy around HasanAbi. On October 7, 2025, clips surfaced online showing Hasan using an electronic collar on his dog, Kaya. Many accused him of animal abuse, but Hasan Piker said the collar only vibrated and did not shock the dog.Also Read: Nina Lin Banned On Twitch Again After New Viral Clips Sparks Backlash Michael J.

MUMBAI: Mumbai police said the captor who held 17 children and two others hostage at a recording studio fired first, prompting retaliatory firing by the police in which he died.Police officials said that they spent nearly two hours trying to negotiate with Rohit Aarrya and gauge his demands, but he refused to cooperate, even after parents of one hostage said she suffered from seizures. An official said Aarrya appeared calm when police spoke to him.“Regardless of his demands, we couldn’t let him play with people’s lives. He fired first at police. Our team fired back in self-defence. There was no other option,” city police commissioner Deven Bharti said. Other officials iterated the safety of those held captive was top priority, adding the police team’s response was measured and according to protocol.The death prompted calls by legal experts for a magisterial inquiry, as laid down by law, to verify the claim of retaliatory police firing.While Aarrya did not elaborate on his motive in a video released earlier in the day or during police’s attempts at negotiations, it emerged that Aarrya had sat on a hunger strike against former school education minister Deepak Kesarkar of Shiv Sena in 2024 over alleged dues of Rs 2 crore for a state-sanctioned school cleanliness project.Kesarkar said he personally gave him some money as a “gesture of sympathy” even though the school education department maintained Aarrya had collected payment directly from some children. He said Aarrya should have taken up the issue with the department instead of holding kids hostage.Police said Aarrya had been holding auditions at RA Studio in Powai for the past five days for a web series he was planning. Thursday was the final casting call. Auditions began at 10am and the children — from Navi Mumbai, Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli and other parts of the state — arrived earlier, said a security guard at Mahavir Classik, which housed the studio.Around 1.45pm, an anonymous caller alerted Powai police after parents outside the building began yelling after their children failed to emerge for lunch. Within minutes, the road outside Mahavir Classik was packed with police vehicles, ambulances and fire tenders. “It was a challenging operation,” said DCP Datta Nalawde.Officers broke through a bathroom grille and stormed the studio. Police said Aarrya fired first with an air gun; officers returned fire, hitting him in the chest. He was rushed to hospital where doctors declared him dead.","Police say Rohit Aarrya fired first with an air gun; officers returned fire, hitting him in the chest.

Top doctor reveals why Trump suddenly got an MRI scan: 'Undisclosed medical problems...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/top-doctor-reveals-why-trump-suddenly-got-an-mri-scan-undisclosed-medical-problems-/articleshow/124858277.cms,"Trump Slips Up, Admits MRI At Walter Reed In Latest 'Routine Physical' Checkup At Medical Centre

The consultation



'Perfect' results



No MRI without a clear reason



Medications







A top American cardiologist has suggested that President Donald Trump may have quietly undergone an MRI scan due to potential neurological or cardiovascular symptoms.Dr Jonathan Reiner is a professor of medicine at George Washington University. He is also a former cardiologist to ex-vice president Dick Cheney.Reiner told CNN that MRIs are never performed as part of a routine check-up, implying that Trump’s test was probably forced due to symptoms.“Typically, they’re prompted by symptoms,” Reiner explained. “They can be neurologic symptoms that prompt an MRI. They could be back pain that prompts an MRI. There can be issues with the heart that would prompt an MRI. And for those reasons, the public should really be told, you know, why did the president undergo the test, what consultants he saw, and what was the result of the testing?”79-year-old Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he had received an MRI, calling the results “perfect.” When asked about why the scan was done, he redirected questions to his doctors and added, “I gave you the full results. We had an MRI… you know the whole thing. And it was perfect.”The White House has not disclosed the reason for the MRI, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt describing it as part of a “routine health check.” However, Reiner strongly disagreed, saying, “An MRI is never part of a routine evaluation, whether you’re president of the United States or whether you’re just a civilian.”Public health physician Dr Vin Gupta supported Reiner’s statement, writing on X, “Even if you are leader of the free world, you don’t just get an MRI without a clear reason to do so. There’s no such thing as a ‘screening’ MRI.”Concerns about Trump’s health have grown in recent months after several public appearances showed him with visible bruises on his hands and a noticeably uneven gait. At times, he appeared slower on his feet and struggled with short-term recollection.The White House announced in July that Trump suffers from chronic venous insufficiency, a condition in which veins struggle to send blood from the legs back to the heart. Reiner suggested that Trump’s visible bruising and cankles might be linked to blood-thinning medication, which is commonly prescribed for cardiovascular issues.“There are a lot of things that can do that,” Reiner said. “The most common cause for bruising in the back of a 79-year-old person’s hand is medications. And the typical medication that causes that would be a blood thinner.”He added that people usually take such drugs with conditions like pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, or atrial fibrillation. “People who take blood thinners for atrial fibrillation typically are on them indefinitely, and the side effects of medications like that are bruising,” Reiner said.He concluded that the key question is not just what the MRI showed, but why it was ordered. “Why he would have an MRI depends on the underlying reason for either that medication or other undisclosed medical problems. It is just as important why he had the test as what the test showed.”","Dr Jonathan Reiner is a professor of medicine at George Washington University.

Storm devastates Jamaica: Hurricane Hunters film inside eye of Category 5 Melissa — Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/storm-devastates-jamaica-hurricane-hunters-film-inside-eye-of-category-5-melissa-watch/articleshow/124864582.cms,"Hurricane Melissa Turns Into STRONGEST STORM On Earth This Year; Jamaica, Cuba ‘On Knees’

Jamaica braces for its strongest storm in 174 years

Cuba and the Bahamas next in line





Jaw-dropping videos shot from inside the eye of Category 5 Hurricane Melissa have stunned viewers across the world, offering a rare glimpse of nature’s fury at its most extreme. One clip, recorded by a US Air Force “Hurricane Hunter” crew, shows the so-called “stadium effect” — towering clouds curving around a calm blue centre — as the aircraft cuts through the storm’s core.The footage, filmed on multiple passes through Melissa, quickly went viral. “Third pass through Melissa. GoPro in side window as different camera looking forward shooting in ultra high res 8K,” wrote pilot and storm chaser @FlynonymousWX, who shared the video on X. He described the mission as “very powerful but relatively straightforward” compared to earlier flights that faced intense turbulence and “nasty meso activity. ”The US Air Force Reserve’s 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, based at Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi, is the only operational unit in the world to routinely fly into hurricanes. The team, known as the “Hurricane Hunters,” collects vital data for the U.S. National Hurricane Center to forecast the storm’s strength and path.Hurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica early Tuesday, bringing winds of up to 175 mph (282 km/h) and torrential rain.The U.S. National Hurricane Center warned of “catastrophic and life-threatening” flooding, landslides and storm surges reaching up to 13 feet along the southern coast.Prime Minister Andrew Holness described the hurricane as the island’s most violent in recorded history, saying: “There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5. The question now is the speed of recovery — that’s the challenge.”Despite evacuation orders, many residents chose to remain in their homes. “I’m not moving. I don’t believe I can run from death,” said Roy Brown, a plumber in Kingston’s Port Royal district. Others cited poor conditions in public shelters. “I have no choice but to be here,” said Sandra Walker, a vendor in St Elizabeth, who feared losing her livelihood.Officials reported landslides, widespread power cuts, and at least three storm-related deaths. “It’s nothing to play with,” warned Environment Minister Matthew Samuda, urging Jamaicans to stay indoors.After battering Jamaica, Melissa is expected to move north towards Cuba late Tuesday before crossing the Bahamas. Cuban authorities began evacuating more than 600,000 people from coastal regions, including the eastern provinces of Santiago de Cuba and Guantánamo, amid fears of severe flooding and a storm surge up to 20 inches high.The storm has already claimed at least seven lives across the Caribbean — three in Jamaica, three in Haiti, and one in the Dominican Republic — and displaced thousands. In Haiti, officials reported crop destruction and flooding in multiple provinces, worsening the country’s hunger crisis.Meteorologists warn that Melissa’s slow speed could amplify destruction, as its rains linger over affected areas. “Water kills a lot more people than wind,” said climate scientist Kerry Emanuel, adding that human-driven warming is making such rapid intensification events more frequent.As Jamaican authorities prepare for what could be the strongest storm since records began 174 years ago, Prime Minister Holness urged calm but vigilance: “You have been warned. It’s now up to you to make the right decision.”","Hurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica early Tuesday, bringing winds of up to 175 mph (282 km/h) and torrential rain.

'Money pouring into US': Trump hails tariffs after Asia trip; reveals 'one question that kept coming up',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/money-pouring-into-us-trump-hails-tariffs-after-asia-trip-reveals-one-question-that-kept-coming-up/articleshow/124981449.cms,"Trump, Xi Defuse Tariff Time Bomb? U.S. & China Edge Towards Ending Trade War | Global Pulse





US President Donald Trump on Friday hailed his trip to Southeast Asia, claiming that “great deals” were secured and that the United States is now “respected like never before.” The 47th POTUS said that “money is pouring into the country” thanks to his tariff policies and what he described as the “landslide results” of the 2024 presidential election.In a lengthy post on Truth Social, the US president described his meetings with leaders from across the region — including China, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Australia, Canada, and others — as proof that “America is respected again — respected like never before.”Trump hailed the success of the trip, which followed a breakthrough meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea that led to both sides easing tariffs, resuming soybean trade, and pausing port and export restrictions for a year. “Great Trade Deals were made, Long Term relationships now exist,” Trump wrote, claiming that his economic policies had triggered renewed investment in the United States.He said the question that “kept coming up” during his meetings was: “How did the Democrats shut down the United States of America, and why did the powerful Republicans allow them to do it?” Reflecting on that during his return flight, Trump accused Democrats of suffering from what he called a “sick form” of Trump Derangement Syndrome.“They want Trillions of Dollars to be taken from our Healthcare System and given to others, who are not deserving — people who have come into our Country illegally, many from prisons and mental institutions,” he wrote.Trump also urged Republicans to abolish the filibuster, calling on the party to use its “TRUMP CARD.” “It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD,’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option — get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!” he said, arguing that Democrats had once tried to do the same under Barack Obama and Harry Reid. “Now I want to do it in order to take advantage of the Democrats,” he added.The president’s remarks came amid cautious optimism following the US-China agreement, which rolled back several tariffs imposed earlier this year and saw Beijing resume major agricultural imports. China agreed to buy 12 million metric tons of American soybeans through January and continue purchases over the next three years, while pausing restrictions on rare earth exports.","US President Donald Trump hailed his trip to Southeast Asia, claiming that “great deals’ were secured.

The White House turned into a haunted mansion with a presidential twist on Thursday night, as President Donald and Melania Trump hosted a Halloween spectacle straight out of a comic book.Superheroes, dinosaurs, and even pint-sized Trumps and Melanias stormed the South Lawn — while the First Couple, skipping costumes, made a dramatic entrance to the spooky strains of Thriller, AP image.They handed out chocolate to hundreds of costumed children, just hours after the president returned from a five-day swing through Asia.The Trumps took a particular liking to three siblings dressed as a Secret Service agent, the President and the First Lady.Trump gave his doppelganger a high-five before asking the trio to turn around and pose for photographs. The President pointed to the young girl and appeared to mouth, “Melania,” to reporters.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller were among the administration officials partaking in the festivities.Leavitt and her husband, Nicholas Riccio, brought their 1-year-old son in an adorable jack o’lantern outfit.Miller, wearing a suit and tie, was spotted trying to wrangle his young son, who appeared to be in a ghost costume, while his wife, Katie, held their other child, both dressed as skeletons.One of the most unusual costumes belonged to a boy who came dressed as a filthy toilet, with a “wide load” sign on the back. Trump seemed amused by the party pooper and gave him a chocolate bar. One of the most clever ensembles may have been a family who outfitted their wagon to look like a McDonald’s drive-thru.The Halloween event is an annual White House tradition. Last year, former President Joe Biden awkwardly pretended to bite several infants in the rope line, including one dressed up as a chicken.Perhaps the most memorable Trump Halloween moment took place in 2019, when he placed a candy bar on the head of a kid in a Minion costume during his first term. Trump did it again this year, with a youngster in an unidentified costume with particularly flat headgear.","The White House turned into a haunted mansion with a presidential twist on Thursday night.

Thanksgiving travel at risk

What Happens if the Shutdown Continues?

Federal civilian workers:

Air traffic controllers:





Nearly a month into the shutdown, food banks across the country were straining to meet rising demand from hundreds of thousands of federal workers who were furloughed or working without pay and were bracing for an even bigger surge as benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program were set to lapse on Nov. 1.More than one in eight Americans depended on food stamps from SNAP, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Recipients received an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card to buy groceries, and many families relied on those benefits as their main source of money for food, CBS news reported.The Community Table Food Bank in Arvada, Colorado, was so inundated with people on Thursday that it had to temporarily close. Before it did, Danielle Brann, a SNAP recipient, obtained essentials including ham and crackers and cans of spaghetti sauce.“The line started at 9 o’clock this morning and I don’t remember ever seeing it this busy. I mean they’re turning people away. So it’s more of a demand for sure,” Brann said.In Delaware County, Pennsylvania, the Loaves and Fishes Food Pantry also had to turn people away on Tuesday because food was leaving the shelves faster than it could be restocked.Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that Americans could face a travel “disaster” as Thanksgiving approaches next month without an end in sight to the govt shutdown.Their comments came after Vance hosted a roundtable of aviation, travel and union leaders at the White House, during which they aired their concerns with the current state of the industry and worked out potential, temporary solutions to ease the strain on Federal Aviation Administration employees who were being forced to work without pay to ensure Americans could fly safely, two White House officials told CNN.“Look it could be a disaster. It really could be, because at that point you’re talking about people have missed three paychecks. They’ve missed four paychecks. How many of them are not going to show up for work?” Vance said.“That’s going to lead to massive delays. We want people to be able to get home for Thanksgiving. We want people to be able to travel for business,” he continued.Air traffic control staffing problems spiked over the weekend, raising concerns about growing disruption Duffy added, “Our traffic will be snarled, but it will be a disaster in aviation.”More than a million active-duty service members in the United States would have missed their pay cheques on Friday if the Trump administration will not intervene, BBC reported.About a quarter of military families were considered food insecure, and 15% relied on Snap or food pantries, according to research firm Rand. Meanwhile, the Military Family Advisory Network estimated that 27% of families had £380 or less in emergency savings.The Pentagon said it had accepted a $130m gift from a wealthy donor to help pay salaries during the shutdown, which worked out to $100 for each of the 1.3 million service members expecting to be paid.The White House planned to pay the troops on 31 October by using money from a military housing fund, a research-and-development account and a defence procurement fund, according to Axios.Earlier this month the administration made payroll by moving $6.5bn from military research. More than 160 families told the National Military Family Association that they had been underpaid during the shutdown, some by hundreds of dollars and others by thousands.If the shutdown continues, then some 4.5 million paycheques would have been withheld from civilian employees, representing about $21bn in missing wages, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.Furloughed employees were typically paid after shutdowns ended, although Trump had threatened to withhold pay and was attempting to fire thousands of workers, a move being challenged in court.Thousands of air traffic controllers missed their first paycheques this week.

White House MOCKS Kamala Harris’ ‘Cackle’ After She Calls Trump Officials “Crazy” at LA Event

107 Days





In one of the most heartbreaking moments for Democrats, Kamala Harris recalled the time she realised her 2024 presidential campaign was over, and she had gone ""into a state of shock” when told she was short of 200,000 votes and lost to the MAGA chief Donald Trump.“I got a call from my campaign manager saying we need 200,000 more votes that we can’t find,” Harris said onpodcast with Steven Bartlett. “I was in a state of shock, I was so inarticulate. I kept saying ‘My God, my God, my God’ over and over.”The former vice president also discussed her relationship with former President Joe Biden, under whom she had served. Harris took over as the Democratic nominee after Biden dropped out of the race in July 2024, but ultimately lost to Trump in November.In her new memoir,, Harris recounts concern over Biden’s ability to run for re-election. Speaking to Bartlett, she revealed she had sensed something was “a little off” with Biden months before the election.“He called me from debate camp ... and I could tell something was a little off,” she said. “And I was concerned about—I just, I don't think he wanted to debate, is my point.”The June 2024 debate became infamous for Biden’s shaky performance, where he appeared frail and struggled to finish sentences.Harris said she watched from Los Angeles with a small team, ready to give honest feedback. “There will be something to clean up, and I expected that,” she said. “And then, you know, we saw what we all saw.”In an earlier interview with Rachel Maddow, Harris admitted she regretted not urging Biden to reconsider his re-election bid. “When I talk about the recklessness, as much as anything, I'm talking about myself,” she said.Despite the loss, Harris told the BBC this month that she remains open to another presidential run. “I am not done,” she said. “I have lived my entire career as a life of service, and it's in my bones.”","Kamala Harris says she was 'in a state of shock' when told her 2024 presidential campaign was over.

The FBI responded to the allegation that director Kash Patel flew on a $60M FBI jet to attend his girlfriend Alexis Wilkins' performance in Pennsylvania, and said he broke no rules while he did that. The allegation came from a former FBI agent-turned-podcaster Kyle Seraphin who commented about Patel flying around the country during the ongoing government shutdown.“We’re in the middle of government shutdown where they’re not even gonna pay all of the employees that work for the agency that this guy heads,” Seraphin said. “And this guy is jetting off to hang out with his girlfriend in Nashville on our dime?”This is not the first time that Kash Patel 's use of FBI jets for personal reasons came under fire. This time, the FBI issued a detailed statement comparing Kash Patel's travels with his predecessors, like Chris Wray and James Comey.The FBI director is not allowed to travel in commercial planes and they are only supposed to travel in government planes. Following the established rules, Director Patel pays a reimbursement in advance, Ben Williamson, assistant director for public affairs at FBI, said.Williamson detailed the steps Kash Patel personally takes to minimize spending.

A young MAGA supporter pulled no punches when he asked vice-president JD Vance a pointed question about the possibility of tyranny following the deployment of the National Guard under US President Donald Trump.The exchange took place at the Turning Point USA event at the University of Mississippi, in Oxford, Mississippi.The teenager was perched in the audience and wearing a “Freedom” t-shirt and a MAGA cap. He prefaced his question by saying, “I’m a huge supporter of you guys before I make my argument. But there is something you guys are doing that is kind of disturbing me a little bit.”He referenced the military deployment by the Trump administration in Washington, DC and other cities, saying: “They’ve had wonderful results. No one can deny the results of that. Some might even say the greatest.” The fan then posed the main concern: “Let’s say we get a complete tyrant in office… what is the difference between what you’re doing and how can we prevent someone from abusing that power?”Vance replied by acknowledging the question’s legitimacy. He said: “I understand where the question is coming from, and I think it’s a fair question. And it’s going to sound like I’m being sarcastic, and it really is not meant in any offence.” He went on to offer a hypothetical shift of focus: “But when you talk about ‘what could another administration do,’ to take a wild, hypothetical example totally off the top of my head: what if Joe Biden sent the Federal Bureau of Investigation to start arresting his political opponents?”Drawing on his political philosophy, Vance said: “I want every conservative to remember—It’s an important part of my entire political philosophy—we cannot be afraid to do something because the left might do it in the future. The left is already going to do it, regardless of whether we do it.”The fan pointed out what he called a “disturbing” trend of using the military for law enforcement inside the country. The National Guard deployment in Washington, DC, alone is said to cost about 1 million dollars a day. A recent Gallup poll also showed that most Americans — around 60 per cent — are against sending troops into cities to control crime, while 39 per cent support the idea.Vance’s appearance at the event came alongside Erika Kirk, widow of late conservative activist Charlie Kirk. It was the first major Turning Point USA tour stop since Kirk’s assassination earlier in September.","JD Vance was speaking at a Turning Point USA event in Oxford, Mississippi.

Did Vance insult Hindus?









Amid a raging controversy over Vice President JD Vance's comment on his Christianity , Hindu American Foundation director Suhag Shukla said Vance insulted Hinduism by saying that Hindu traditions are ""just not good enough"". The Vice President of the United States @JDVance just said that the Hindu traditions that his wife and millions of Americans share is just not good enough.

He was slammed for disrespecting his wife and her Hindu faith which many commentators interpreted as his desperate attempt to appease the MAGA base.""Yes, my wife did not grow up Christian. I think it's fair to say that she grew up in a Hindu family but not a particularly religious family in either direction,"" Vance said. ""In fact, when I met my wife … I would consider myself an agnostic or an atheist, and that's what I think she would have considered herself as well.""The VP said their kids are being raised as Christians. ""Our two oldest kids ... go to a Christian school. Our 8-year-old did his first Communion about a year ago.That's the way that we have come to our arrangement.""""As I've told her, and I've said publicly, and I'll say now in front of 10,000 of my closest friends: Do I hope eventually that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved by church? Yeah, I honestly do wish that because I believe in the Christian Gospel, and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way. But if she doesn't, then God says everybody has free will, and so that doesn't cause a problem for me,"" JD Vance explained.Vance did not say anything about Hinduism, but referred to Usha Vance as an agnostic though Usha Vance earlier claimed that she is from a religious Hindu family Suhag's post came under scrutiny as many claimed that JD Vance did not say anything about Hinduism.

Row erupts over White House’s ‘racist’ Halloween post confusing two Black leaders: ‘Doing wonders for culture’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/row-erupts-over-white-houses-racist-halloween-post-confusing-two-black-leaders-doing-wonders-for-culture/articleshow/124964518.cms,"



A Halloween-themed social media post by the White House started a row after it appeared to confuse two Black political leaders while trying to mock Democrats.The post on social media platform X featured “Halloween costume inspiration” images comparing President Donald Trump and vice president JD Vance with their Democratic rivals, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. However, the caption describing Jeffries’ “costume” seemed to confuse him with Senator Cory Booker.The image of Jeffries showed him wearing a sombrero with a caption that read, “one filibuster speech no one remembers.” The error drew attention because Jeffries serves in the House, where filibusters do not exist. The description appeared to refer instead to Booker’s 25-hour speech in April criticising the Trump administration, which became the longest filibuster-style address in Senate history.The sombrero itself sparked backlash. It appeared to reference a “racist” AI-generated video President Trump shared earlier this month that depicted Jeffries wearing a sombrero and handlebar moustache while mariachi music played. At the time, Jeffries called the video “disgusting,” telling reporters, “Mr. President, the next time you have something to say about me, don’t cop out through a racist and fake AI video.When I’m back in the Oval Office, say it to my face.”Vance defended the imagery, saying, “The president’s joking, and we’re having a good time,” before adding that the posts would stop if Jeffries helped reopen the government, according to the Daily Beast.Even Schumer’s mock costume description included another sombrero reference, reading, “Includes: your money given to illegals, life subscription to performative outrage. Not included: sombrero, spine.”","The White House posted a Halloween-themed social media post that appeared to confuse two Black political leaders.

'Telling girls that men are better at being women': JK Rowling fans flames over UK magazine featuring trans models,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/telling-girls-that-men-are-better-at-being-women-jk-rowling-stirs-row-over-uk-magazine-featuring-trans-models/articleshow/124959010.cms,"How did Netizens take it?



Rowling's 'gender-war'







JK Rowling started a fresh row over trans rights in Britain after launching an attack on Glamour UK’s “Women of the Year” feature, celebrating nine transgender women.The Harry Potter author posted on X that she grew up in a time when women’s magazines told girls to be “thinner and prettier” — and now, she claimed, those same outlets tell girls “that men are better women than they are. ”Rowling’s remarks accompanied an image of the Glamour feature. The magazine described the group — including model and author Munroe Bergdorf, actor Bel Priestley, and activist Dani St James — as “trans women working across fashion, music, publishing and activism.”However, her post divided social media. Many supported her comments, accusing mainstream media of erasing biological women. “We went from telling girls they weren’t good enough to telling them they’re not even girls anymore,” one user wrote. Another added, “From ‘you’re not thin enough’ to ‘you’re not male enough’ — exactly right.”Others accused Rowling of fuelling hostility toward an already marginalised community. “Your nostalgia for 90s beauty standards ignores how today’s recognition of trans women is progress,” one wrote. Another said, “The trans movement isn’t misogynistic — it’s dismantling the same toxic gatekeeping you’re defending.”The clash is an ongoing consequence of the deepening divide in British public discourse over gender identity. In recent years, Rowling has become a central figure in the so-called “gender war,” frequently clashing with activists and politicians over women’s spaces and trans inclusion. Her supporters view her as a defender of biological sex-based rights; critics accuse her of transphobia and of legitimising anti-trans sentiment in mainstream culture.For Glamour, the feature aimed to spotlight trans women’s resilience amid increasing political hostility and rising hate crimes in the UK. The magazine wrote that “trans people — and especially trans women — are facing a committed attempt from anti-trans groups and politicians to make exclusionary policy the default across British public life.” It said the campaign sought to promote dignity, opportunity, and equality for trans women, particularly in employment and healthcare.The Glamour UK cover is part of the “Protect the Dolls” campaign, which began when designer Conner Ives wore a T-shirt with the slogan during his fashion show earlier this year. He said it was a show of support for his trans friends facing hate in the US. The message quickly spread online, helping raise more than $600,000 for the charity Trans Lifeline and gaining support from stars like Madonna, Pedro Pascal, Troye Sivan, and Mariah Carey.","Harry Potter author attacked Glamour UK’s “Women of the Year’ feature, celebrating nine transgender women.

'Pakistan’s patience has run its course'



Growing tensions on the border







Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with the United States that allows the use of drones within its territory, TOLOnews reported, citing Afghan and diplomatic sources. The acknowledgment, made during the latest round of Pakistan-Afghanistan peace talks in Turkey.According to TOLOnews, the Pakistani delegation said it “cannot break” the agreement with Washington that authorises drone operations. Afghan negotiators, in response, demanded written guarantees that Pakistan would not allow US drones to use its airspace or strike Afghan territory. Sources familiar with the talks, cited by TOLOnews said Pakistan’s delegation initially agreed to these conditions but later reversed its position after receiving instructions from Islamabad, saying it had “no control over US drones and could not ensure action against ISIS. ” Qatari and Turkish mediators were reportedly taken aback by the sudden shift in stance.The Afghan side reiterated that the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) issue was Pakistan’s own internal problem. “The Islamic Emirate has repeatedly emphasised, and again reaffirmed, that insecurity in Pakistan is a domestic matter,” TOLOnews quoted its delegation as saying, adding that Afghanistan remains committed to ensuring no group uses its soil to harm other nations.The disclosure came as four days of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement. Pakistan’s information minister Attaullah Tarar said the dialogue “failed to bring about any workable solution,” blaming Kabul for refusing to act against militants responsible for cross-border attacks. “Pakistan’s patience has run its course,” Tarar said, adding that Islamabad “would continue to take all possible measures necessary to protect our people from terrorism. ”Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif issued a strong warning to the Taliban regime, vowing that Islamabad could “strike deep into Afghanistan” if further attacks occurred. “If their territory is used and they violate ours, we will retaliate — we surely will,” Asif told reporters. In a separate post on X, he cautioned Kabul against testing Pakistan’s “resolve and capabilities at its own peril and doom.”The breakdown in talks follows weeks of escalating border clashes that left dozens dead. Pakistan’s military earlier this month struck what it described as TTP hideouts inside Afghanistan, prompting retaliatory attacks that killed Pakistani soldiers. Though a ceasefire brokered by Qatar on 19 October remains technically in effect, all major crossings between the two countries remain closed, with hundreds of trucks stranded.Islamabad insists that the Afghan Taliban continues to shelter militants who launch attacks in Pakistan, a charge Kabul denies. The UN has expressed concern over the failed negotiations, urging both sides to avoid renewed fighting.","Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with the United States that allows the use of drones within its territory, TOLOnews reported.
