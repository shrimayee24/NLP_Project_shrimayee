"National Aerospace Lab develops 'Kamikaze' drone with 1,000km range",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/national-aerospace-lab-develops-kamikaze-drone-with-1000km-range/articleshow/112552748.cms,"NEW DELHI: Taking a cue from the ongoing Middle East conflict and the Ukraine-Russia war where both sides have been using self-destructive drones to attack rival’s assets, India’s elite research institute National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) has developed a desi ‘Kamikaze’ drone that is driven by an indigenously-built engine that gives them a range of 1,000 km.NAL director Abhay Pashilkar, who is leading the research into self-destructive drones, told the media that such drones have added new dimensions to how wars are fought. These low-cost and effective unmanned aerial vehicles fly at a certain altitude, loiter around its target with explosive charges and detonate the explosives once they hit the target. They are controlled from a command centre.The 30HP Wankel engine in these drones allows them to carry 100-120kg weight, which includes 30-40 kg of explosives. NAL is a constituent of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), which was established in 1959 and is the only govt aerospace R&D laboratory in the country's civilian sector.The concept of kamikaze mission originated from World War II when Japanese pilots would ram their planes into Allied Forces’ assets, sacrificing themselves to inflict maximum damage. The modern Kamikaze drones, however, are unmanned, remotely controlled and have a precision strike.NAL’s Kamikaze drone is approximately 2.8 metres in length with a wingspan of 3.5 metres. These drones can also be deployed in swarms, overwhelming enemy defences and radars. One of the key features of these drones is their ability to operate in GPS-denied environments. Equipped with Isro-developed navigation system NaVIC, these drones can navigate and acquire targets even in areas where GPS signals are jammed.The Indian Army has currently inducted and deployed tiny Kamikaze drones called ‘Hoverbee’ in counter-terror operations in border areas that have been built by a Bengaluru-based startup. Though it neutralises threats with precision, its explosives-carrying capacity is less as compared to 30kg for NAL's Kamikaze drones. Once deployed, these new drones will add to the punching power of the security forces.","India's elite research institute National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) has developed a desi ‘Kamikaze’ drone that is driven by an indigenously-built engine that gives them a range of 1,000 km.

Trinamool MP Abhishek condemns the violence

BJP Leader Suvendu Adhikari alleges TMC involvement

Nationwide protests and CBI probe

In the early hours of Thursday morning, chaos erupted at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital after a group of miscreants broke through barricades, manhandled protesting doctors, and damaged hospital property, including the emergency building where the body of a woman doctor was found last week, according to police reports.The incident occurred during midnight protests by women outraged over the horrific rape and murder of the doctor at the hospital.The vandalism took place as 'Reclaim the Nights' protest rallies—organized to demand justice for the brutal rape and murder of a young PGT doctor—converged at the hospital from various parts of the city.Police reported that a group of nearly 40 people, allegedly disguised as protesters, entered the hospital premises, vandalized property, and pelted stones at police officers, prompting the police to fire teargas to disperse the mob. Emergency beds occupied by patients were also vandalized, forcing doctors, nurses, and police officers to flee. The intruders, who were dressed in shorts and vests, were not part of the initial rallies.In addition to the damage to the hospital, a police vehicle and several two-wheelers were also vandalized, with some police officers injured in the violence.The 'Reclaim the Night' campaign, which gained momentum through social media, began at 11:55 pm, coinciding with Independence Day celebrations, and spread across key areas in both small towns and big cities, including several landmarks in Kolkata.As tensions escalated, Kolkata Police Commissioner Vineet Goyal arrived at the scene around 2 am and criticized the media for what he called a malicious campaign against the police.Commissioner Goyal defended the actions of the Kolkata Police, saying they had left no stone unturned in the investigation. He asserted that even the CBI would not be able to prove that the police were trying to shield anyone.""What has happened here is the result of a wrong media campaign, a malicious campaign against Kolkata police. What has Kolkata police not done? We have done everything in this case... We have tried to satisfy the family, but rumors are being spread... I am extremely angry. We have not done anything wrong. Because of this malicious campaign, Kolkata police have lost the trust of the people. We have never claimed that there is only one suspect; we are waiting for scientific evidence, and it takes time... I can't arrest a young PG student based on rumors—it's against my conscience. There is immense pressure from the media, but we have acted appropriately. Now, the CBI is investigating. They'll conduct a fair probe, and we will fully support them... False propaganda is circulating that bones are broken, this is done, that is done, but unfortunately, it's not supported by scientific evidence,"" Goyal said.He further said, ""Please don't spread the rumours. We are verifying everything... We are constantly interrogating everyone who was there. On the first night, the additional CP was here and he had interrogated everyone personally. Just by rumour-mongering and bringing distrust to the citizens, I think this city is the loser, not Vineet Goyal... You must ask CBI, the kind of work the officers have done in the span of these four days and the city has given them this, this is demoralising for them.""Trinamool MP and Mamata Banerjee's nephew, Abhishek Banerjee, condemned the vandalism at RG Kar Medical College, saying it had crossed all acceptable limits. ""The hooliganism and vandalism at RG Kar tonight have exceeded all acceptable limits. As a public representative, I just spoke with @CPKolkata, urging him to ensure that every individual responsible for today’s violence is identified, held accountable, and made to face the law within the next 24 hours, regardless of their political affiliations. The demands of the protesting doctors are fair and justified. This is the minimum they should expect from the government. Their safety and security must be prioritized,"" Abhishek posted on X.BJP leader and Leader of the Opposition, Suvendu Adhikari, alleged that the vandalism was orchestrated by ""TMC goons"" sent by Mamata Banerjee. ""Mamata Banerjee has sent her TMC goons to the apolitical protest rally near RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. She thinks that she is the most shrewd person in the world and that people won't figure out the cunning plan of her goons, disguised as protesters, mixing with the crowd and carrying out vandalism inside RG Kar Medical College and Hospital,"" Adhikari said in a post on X.Adhikari also alleged that the miscreants were given safe passage by the police. ""They were given safe passage by the police, who either ran away or looked the other way so that these thugs could enter the hospital premises and destroy areas containing crucial evidence so that it doesn't get picked up by the CBI,"" he claimed.The horrific rape and murder of the on-duty doctor have sent shockwaves across the nation, sparking silent protests, candlelight marches, and 'Reclaim the Night' rallies in several parts of the country. Doctors' associations are demanding assurances of minimum security in their workplaces.The semi-naked body of the 32-year-old woman was found on the morning of August 9 in the seminar hall of the government-run hospital in Kolkata.Amid the ongoing tussle between the Trinamool Congress and the BJP over the tragedy, the investigation into the heinous crime has been handed over to the CBI. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has assured full support to the CBI, emphasizing the need to solve the case at the earliest.Kolkata Police civic volunteer Sanjay Roy has been arrested in connection with the case. However, doctors, citing autopsy report findings, believe that more than one person was involved in the assault and murder of the doctor.The Calcutta High Court on Tuesday ordered the transfer of the investigation from the Kolkata Police to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).","Violence erupted at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Thursday morning.

PM Modi: Must instil dread of death in those who perpetrate crimes against women,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-must-instil-dread-of-death-in-those-who-perpetrate-crimes-against-women/articleshow/112552362.cms,"NEW DELHI: Expressing worry and pain over continuing crimes against women , Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech called for swift probe in all such cases and harsh punishment including death penalty as a deterrent for others disposed to committing such "" demonic acts "".""The fear of punishment must be instilled among the perpetrators...Those who commit such demonic acts should realise that they will be hanged to death,"" said PM in his I-Day speech which followed the countrywide outrage over the brutal rape and murder of a woman doctor in a Kolkata hospital and alleged cover up by authorities.He urged the country, society, and the state governments to ""address this matter with utmost urgency"".The endorsement of death penalty for ""demonic"" acts like brutal rapes - perhaps the first by a PM in an Independence Day speech - comes amid a campaign to abolish the death penalty even for crimes falling in the ""rarest-of-rare"" category, the threshold devised by Supreme Court for minimising its use. While making his pitch for the capital punishment, PM referred to anger and frustration among women over continuing brutalities against them. ""Today, from the Red Fort, I once again express my pain. As a society, we will have to think seriously about the atrocities against our mothers, sisters, and daughters. There is anger among common people because of this. I can feel that rage,"" he said.The PM also stressed the need to amplify not just the news and discussion on the crime but also cases of punishment to ensure deterrence. He said, ""When a person of such demonic tendency is punished, it does not make headlines. It is the need of the hour that extensive discussion on those receiving punishment is held so that those committing this sin understand that this crime leads to hanging (death penalty). I feel it is very important to instil this fear,"" he said.In the past 28 years, as many as six convicts have been hanged for rape-cum-murder cases - Kanta Prasad Tiwari in 1997, Dhananjoy Chatterjee in 2004 and four convicts in Nirbhaya murder cases in 2020. The Supreme Court had endorsed capital punishment in all these cases.The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023 (BNS) that has replaced the Indian Penal Code provides for life imprisonment or death penalty in case of rape of girls below the age of 18 years. All gangrape cases are punishable with imprisonment up to 20 years or life imprisonment.While talking about taking pride in the history behind the freedom struggle, the PM highlighted that it is important to note that the govt has replaced the criminal laws - the IPC, CrPC and the Indian Evidence Act that had their roots in the pre-Independence British era with three new laws overhauling the criminal justice system. He said that the new laws are not just about punitive measures but strengthen the resolve for ensuring justice for the common man.","PM Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech called for swift probe in all such cases and harsh punishment including death penalty.

Who is Sanjay Roy?

Roy joined Kolkata Police’s Disaster Management Group as a civic volunteer in 2019 but used “the right channels” to shift to Kolkata Police’s Welfare Cell.

He reportedly used “connections” to live on the premises of KP’s 4th Battalion. This association helped him get posted at RG Kar Hospital.

Hospital. Roy had been assigned to the police outpost at RG Kar Hospital on several occasions, sometimes for extended periods, granting him easy access to all hospital departments.

What are his position and entitlements?

It has come to light that Roy is a member of the Police Welfare Board’s 14-member central committee, and his 'disapproval' could lead to the transfer of police officers.

Roy received 5 liters of free fuel daily to use a police motorcycle for personal purposes. The motorcycle, which had a police sticker, was seized on Monday.

The bike Sanjay Roy used to ride had a police sticker on it

What are the allegations against him?

A police inquiry into Sanjay Roy has uncovered multiple allegations against him, including extortion, intimidation, and threats against women.

He was found guilty on at least two occasions—first for assaulting his pregnant wife in 2022, and later for misbehaving with a female doctor a few weeks ago—but he was never censured. He managed to evade capture even after assaulting his pregnant wife.

On Monday, a woman went to Lalbazar to report that Roy had been harassing her by phone for the past three months. He first approached her at RG Kar Hospital under the pretext of buying medicine, obtained her number from the prescription, and has since pressured and threatened her to meet.

Another complaint against Roy concerns police transfers. An officer suspects that his significant “influence” may have played an active role in at least six transfers from the Tala police station and Shyambazar police outpost in recent weeks.

CCTV footage captured Roy entering the emergency building at 4am wearing a bluetooth device around his neck. When he left the building 40 minutes later, the earphone was no longer visible. The device was later found to be paired with his cellphone.

What happened at RG Kar on Friday?

Post-midnight, deceased doctor and four colleagues ordered food and had dinner in the seminar room while watching Neeraj Chopra win silver.

After the meal, her colleagues departed, and she remained in the room to continue her studies. She handed over her duties to colleagues, and went to the seminar hall to study. At around 2 am, someone from the hospital visited her in the seminar hall to discuss a patient’s treatment.

Police said that around the same time, she had received a message from her cousin and replied at 2.35 am, saying everything was ""normal"" till then. Before 3 am, a hospital staff member found her lying under a red blanket in the seminar hall. It is assumed that the accused, Sanjay, entered the seminar hall after that.

At 3am, she was seen sleeping in the room.

Around 4am, the accused entered the seminar room, sexually assaulted her. When she attempted to resist, the perpetrator throttled her.

The woman's broken glasses were found next to her laptop, suggesting that she fought her attacker for a considerable time, trying to defend herself.

Her eyes had blood clots from being throttled. Reports indicate that the accused covered her mouth forcefully and slammed her head against the wall, causing injuries to her face. While her thyroid cartilage was not fractured, it did have a blood clot, suggesting the attacker pressed hard to prevent her from escaping. Nail marks on her face indicate she tried to scream but was silenced.

The next morning, when her body was found at 7.30am, her mask was discovered a short distance away. A closed laptop was found near her head, with a diary and her mobile phone placed on top of it. A plastic water bottle was found overturned next to her head.

on the 31-year-old doctor. The report said there were multiple signs of injuries and struggle on the body.

There were blood stains on the face, eyes and face, scratch marks on various parts of the body and bleeding from the private parts.

There were injuries on the lips, abdomen, right hand and fingers while a collar bone was broken.

The report said the death was due to smothering and throttling.

Prima facie, death has been due to gagging and there were multiple signs of injuries and struggle on the body.

The mouth and throat were constantly pressed to prevent screaming. The throat was strangled to suffocate. The thyroid cartilage broke due to this strangulation.

There are aberration marks and bruise marks on the victim’s face, on the eyes till the neck.

The scratch marks on the woman's face, likely caused by the accused's fingernails, suggest that she desperately tried to fight back.

The report mentions that the accused “got certain advantage as the victim was in deep sleep at the time of the attack.”

She had tried to resist, and there were deep mark injuries and scratches on the hands of the accused as well.

The report, however, said that there have been no fracture or breakage of the collar bone or pelvis as reported earlier in the initial phase of observation.

What are preliminary forensic findings?

The scratch mark injuries on Sanjay’s body matched with the skin and blood samples collected from the nails of the victim.

Fact check: What do the claims and police responses reveal about the case?

A source from the Kolkata Police revealed that a claim circulating involves semen from three individuals being found on the doctor’s body. However, a police officer said, “It is impossible to distinguish semen from three individuals with the naked eye during an autopsy.” Medical science defines what an adult male is capable of, and what is being circulated is scientifically impossible, source added.

The second claim circulating on social media is that the woman’s collarbone and pelvic guard were broken. However, police say that based on the autopsy report, she did not have any broken bones.

The third claim is that the Kolkata Police informed the family about a possible suicide, but police say the family confirmed the call did not come from them.

Fourthly, there is a rumor that a police officer offered a large sum of money to silence the murdered doctor’s father. However, the police clarified that, following the Nirbhaya case, the state is required to provide financial compensation to the families of victims of murder, acid attacks, rape, and molestation.

NEW DELHI: A Kolkata Police civic volunteer, Sanjay Roy , was taken into custody on Saturday in connection with the brutal rape and murder of a second-year postgraduate trainee doctor at RG Kar Hospital . The arrest came just six hours after a seven-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) was formed to investigate the case. The SIT had brought the 33-year-old suspect in for questioning late Friday night.","Police inquiry into Sanjay Roy has uncovered multiple allegations against him, including extortion, intimidation, and threats against women. CCTV footage captured Roy entering the emergency building at 4am wearing a bluetooth device around his neck. When he left the building 40 minutes later, the earphone was no longer visible. The device was later found to be paired with his cellphone.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112440947,imgsize-36040,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/112440947.jpg"

That is why we keep them in dormitories, and they have a resident assistant. They make really bad decisions!” Kamala Harris said in a 2014 address. But the context of Kamala's statement was different.""We have the greatest opportunity. The support for Trump has just doubled in this election. With all influencers going public about their support for Donald Trump, Elon Musk interview on Twitter...that was just massive ..it pulled in 3 billion impressions across the board and 77% were from below 34 or under. So there's massive youth support...we are not paying the influencers unlike the Kamala campaign,"" Bo said.""There's a lot of statistics put out on how unhappy Gen Z is with their finances and how brutal our economy is.

Life on the line: Tamil Nadu nurse zipped across Wayanad river to save 35,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/life-on-the-line-tamil-nadu-nurse-zipped-across-wayanad-river-to-save-35/articleshow/112552217.cms,"CHENNAI: As a nurse, A Sabeena is no stranger to patients hanging between life and death. The Wayanad landslides of July 30 left the 40-year-old clinging to one such thin line -- a zip line across a raging river in a ravaged swathe of the Kerala pocket to save lives .“It took two minutes to cross the river. It was spine-chilling because of the raging waters beneath me.I just closed my eyes and prayed as I went across,” Sabeena said Thursday, recalling she saw bodies being swept away under her.The single mom zip-lined 10 times over five days across the Mundakkai-Suralmalai river, saving 35 lives. A bridge over the river had collapsed, leaving dozens stranded on an island on the other side.This Independence Day, the native of Gudalur town in Tamil Nadu’s Nilgiris district was speaking after receiving the “Kalpana Chawla Award for daring and courageous enterprise” from Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin, who had especially invited her to the secretariat for the honour.Rewinding to July 30 when access was cut off across the river, the hero who stepped up to the challenge reminisced about that morning. “It was 11am on July 30 when I got a call from colleagues at the NGO where I work, saying the Kerala govt needed nurses in Wayanad,” said Sabeena.Sabeena packed her bags, travelled 70km to Wayanad, braving heavy rain, winds and knee-deep sludge, to reach the ravaged area at 11am. “I had seen footage of the destruction, of bodies strewn everywhere and houses washed away but that did not stop me,” Sabeena said.With currents being too strong for rescuers to swim across, NDRF teams had strung up a zip-line across the river. “Around 100 women nurses were engaged in various tasks. NDRF forces wanted only male nurses to zip-line, but no one was available. Also, the women were too scared because of the fierce currents. I told them I would cross over. My only thought was saving lives. I did not think about my own life,” said Sabeena.Five minutes later, wearing a raincoat, Sabeena was strapped to the zip-line. Once she rappelled to the other side, she treated people who had been bitten by snakes, wounded in the landslide and many with fever.The white-knuckle rides across the river soon became a routine. She would reach the island at 11am, offer medical aid and return at 5pm. “NDRF forces managed to bring them back using the zip-line. Later, the bridge was filled up with mud and made accessible,” Sabeena said, referring to the 35 people who were rescued.Sabeena’s derring-dos came into the spotlight only a few days ago when volunteers from her village began circulating videos of her zip-lining. “The post went viral and reached CM Stalin. I am so happy about getting this award from the CM,” said Sabeena.What overwhelms her most now is her daughter’s WhatsApp status. “For the last few days, my daughter’s status reads ‘There’s no one in this world braver than my mom’. Seeing this gives me so much joy,” says Sabeena.Daughter Shifna, a nursing student, said the biggest lesson her mom taught her was that humanity was always “top priority”.","A Sabeena zip-lined 10 times over five days across the Mundakkai-Suralmalai river, saving 35 lives.

Hezbollah operations

BEIRUT: Ten months of cross-border violence between Hezbollah and Israeli forces has killed senior commanders and several hundred fighters from the Iran-backed group, causing destruction and displacing tens of thousands on both sides.Hezbollah has seen more fighters killed since October than when it last went to war with Israel in the summer of 2006.AFP looks at the mounting toll for the Shiite Muslim movement, which has been trading near-daily fire with the Israeli army in support of Hamas since the Palestinian militant group's October 7 attack on Israel triggered the Gaza war.Israeli strikes have killed key Hezbollah commanders in recent months, the most senior of them top operations chief in south Lebanon Fuad Shukr, who died in a raid on Beirut's southern suburbs on July 30. Hezbollah has vowed to respond to his killing.In January, a commander in Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force, Wissam Tawil, was killed in an Israeli strike on his vehicle in south Lebanon.Two out of its three area commanders in south Lebanon have also been killed -- Mohammed Nasser and Taleb Abdallah.Hezbollah divided its operations in south Lebanon into three areas following the 2006 war, each with its own ""military formation, commander, personnel, weapons and capacities"", the group's chief Hassan Nasrallah said last month.He said south of the Litani river comprised two areas: a western sector, covered by Hezbollah's Aziz unit, and an eastern sector running to the contested Shebaa Farms manned by the group's Nasr unit, which opened Hezbollah's cross-border attacks in October.The third sector, north of the Litani river up to the coastal city of Sidon, is covered by the group's Badr unit.Aziz unit commander Nasser was killed in an Israeli strike last month, while Nasr unit commander Abdallah was killed in a raid the month before.Israel has repeatedly said it has killed other Hezbollah fighters whom it has called ""commanders"".The violence has killed some 570 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters from Hezbollah but also including dozens from allied armed groups including Hamas, according to an AFP tally, with at least 118 civilians among the dead.On the Israeli side, including in the annexed Golan Heights, 22 soldiers and 26 civilians have been killed, according to military figures.Hezbollah has issued statements announcing the deaths of more than 370 members who have been killed in Lebanon, according to the AFP tally.The Lebanese group has mostly described them as ""martyred on the road to Jerusalem"", the phrase it uses to refer to those killed in Israeli strikes.Another 25 have been killed in neighbouring Syria, where Israel has for years carried out strikes on army positions and pro-Iran fighters, also seeking to cut off Hezbollah supply lines to Lebanon from Tehran.According to the statements, around 320 of the slain Hezbollah fighters were from south Lebanon, with some 60 from the eastern Bekaa Valley, which borders Syria.Several south Lebanon villages close to the Israeli border each count around a dozen slain fighters, the statements have indicated.Around 70 percent of the more than 230 fighters killed since late January, when Hezbollah began to provide the year of birth on its death statements, were aged 40 or under.At least six were aged 20 or under, with three born the same year as the 2006 war or after it.A source close to Hezbollah, requesting anonymity, told AFP that fewer than 300 fighters from the group were killed in the 2006 conflict.Hezbollah has said it is seeking to tie up Israeli military resources in the country's north in support of ally Hamas.The escalating attacks have raised fears of a broader conflict, and Lebanon has been on edge since Shukr's death.Earlier this month, the heavily armed group said it had carried out 2,500 ""military operations"" against Israel since October.It claimed to have targeted ""border positions"" 1,328 times and ""military barracks"" 391 times, using a variety of weapons including artillery, rockets, ""guided missiles"" and ""air defence weapons"".The group has also released three videos purportedly showing surveillance drone footage taken by the group across the border, widely viewed as a potential bank of targets in case of all-out war.The footage includes aerial images of military positions in northern Israel and the annexed Golan Heights, as well as sensitive areas in and around the port city of Haifa.","Hezbollah has seen more fighters killed since October than when it last went to war with Israel in the summer of 2006.

'Cautionary tale for ...

However, the quota system was reinstated this year, triggering further protests that ultimately led to the toppling of the government and the prime minister's exile.The former presidential candidate also highlighted the concerning trend of radicals targeting Hindu minorities amidst the chaos. He emphasized that ""bloodshed is the endpoint of grievance and victimhood"" and suggested that the United States should learn from the lessons unfolding in Bangladesh.""Here's what happened: Bangladesh fought a bloody war for its independence in 1971. Hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi civilians were raped and murdered. It was a tragedy, and it was rightly mourned. But in its aftermath, Bangladesh implemented a quota system for jobs in their civil service: 80% of the jobs were allocated to specific social groups (war veterans, rape victims, underrepresented residents, etc.), and only 20% were allocated based on merit,"" he said in a post on X.""The quota system proved to be a disaster. In 2018, protests led Bangladesh to scrap most of the quotas, but the victim-patrons fought back…and the quota system was reinstated this year. That triggered more protests which toppled the government, and the prime minister fled. Once chaos begins, it can't easily be reined in. Radicals are now targeting Hindu minorities. A quota conflict created to rectify the wrongs of rape and violence in 1971 is now leading to more rape and violence in 2024. Bloodshed is the endpoint of grievance and victimhood. It's hard not to look at Bangladesh and wonder what lessons we would do well to learn right here at home,"" he added.Since the ousting of Sheikh Hasina's government on August 5, Bangladesh has been experiencing a volatile political situation. According to reports from two Hindu organizations in the country, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad, members of minority communities in Bangladesh have faced at least 205 incidents of attacks across 52 districts.

'Unduly provocative': Why Israeli minister's prayer at Al-Aqsa mosque has irked the West,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/unduly-provocative-why-israeli-ministers-prayer-at-al-aqsa-mosque-has-irked-the-west/articleshow/112509097.cms,"'We must win this war'

Gvir garners condemnation from West

US urges Netanyahu to prevent 'provocative actions'

Why the controversy?

Israeli minister Itamar Ben Gvir drew criticism from various quarters after he, along with hundreds of Israelies, entered Jerusalem 's Al-Aqsa mosque compound and performed prayers -- this comes as the Middle East remains on edge amid fear of anticipated large-scale Iran and Lebanon attacks in the wake of Hamas chief's assassination Ben Gvir and some 2,250 other Israelis on Tuesday entered the compound in groups, singing Jewish hymns under the protection of Israeli police, an official from the Waqf, the Jordanian body that is the custodian of the site, told news agency AFP.""Minister Ben Gvir, instead of maintaining the status quo at the mosque is supervising the Judaisation operation and trying to change the situation inside Al-Aqsa mosque,"" the official told AFP on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak on the issue.Israeli police also ""imposed restrictions"" on Muslim worshippers trying to enter the mosque, he said.Ben Gvir posted a video statement on social media platform X, which he filmed inside the compound himself, vowing to win the war in Gaza.""We must win this war. We must win and not go to the talks in Doha or Cairo,"" he said, in an apparent reference to US-backed negotiations for a truce and hostage release deal for Gaza scheduled to resume on August 15.""We can defeat Hamas .. we must bring them down to their knees,"" Ben Gvir said.Ben Gvir garnered global condemnation after the mosque visit as he also vowed to ""defeat Hamas"" in Gaza in a video he filmed during the visit.The European Union (EU) condemned ""provocations"" by Gvirm and called it ""violation of status quo"".""The EU strongly condemns the provocations by Israeli Min. Ben Gvir who, during his visit to the Holy Sites, advocated for the violation of the status quo,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell wrote on X.France's foreign ministry also stepped in to condemn Gvir for defying the ban on Jewish prayer at the Al-Aqsa mosque, calling it an unacceptable ""provocation"".The United Nations also slammed the minister, calling his visit ""unduly provocative "".US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prevent further ""provocative actions"" after Gvir's Al-Aqsa visit.Strongly criticising the Israeli minister's visit, Blinken said that Gvir showed ""blatant disregard"" for the status quo.""Prime Minister Netanyahu's office has made clear that the actions of Minister Ben Gvir are inconsistent with Israeli policy. We will look to the government of Israel to prevent similar incidents in the future,"" Blinken said.""These provocative actions only exacerbate tensions at a pivotal moment when all focus should be on the ongoing diplomatic efforts to achieve a ceasefire agreement and secure the release of all hostages and create the conditions for broader regional stability,"" he said.Al-Aqsa mosque has been a point of contention for a long as it is the third holiest site in Islam and also the most sacred in Judaism as Jews revere the site of the ancient temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.Jews and non-Muslims are allowed to visit the mosque compound in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem during predefined hours but are not allowed to display religious symbols or offer prayers.Interestingly, this is not the first time that Ben Gvir has defied the Israeli government's ban on Jewish prayer at the Al-Aqsa compound.Last month, Ben Gvir said he had prayed inside the mosque compound against the rules that allow Jewish visits but forbid prayer.","Israeli minister Itamar Ben Gvir drew criticism from various quarters after he, along with hundreds of Israelies, entered Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque compound and performed prayers.

Mohammed Abu Al-Qumsan 's life was shattered just three days after the birth of his twins, Asser and Aysel.What should have been a time of celebration turned into unimaginable grief when an Israeli airstrike in Deir Al-Balah, central Gaza Strip, claimed the lives of the newborns, their mother, and their grandmother.On the day of the tragedy, Mohammed had left home to obtain birth certificates for his son and daughter, who were just four days old.While at a local government office, he received the news that his home had been bombed. The strike that killed his entire family occurred while he was away, robbing him of the chance to hold and cherish his newborns in what should have been their first days of life.“I don’t know what happened,” Mohammed tearfully recounted, still in shock from the sudden loss.“I am told it was a shell that hit the house. I didn’t even have the time to celebrate them,” Mohammed told APAccording to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry, 115 infants have been born and killed during the ongoing conflict, which began on October 7th following a deadly attack on Israel by Hamas-led gunmen. The attack left 1,200 Israelis dead and sparked a massive military offensive on Gaza that has since claimed over 39,790 Palestinian lives, as reported by the health ministry.The family had sought refuge in the central Gaza Strip after following Israeli army instructions to evacuate Gaza City in the war’s early weeks. Despite their efforts to find safety, they became casualties of the relentless bombing campaign.The Israeli military has stated that it aims to avoid civilian casualties and places the blame on Hamas for operating in densely populated areas. However, the devastation continues, with numerous shelters and civilian homes destroyed in the crossfire.The airstrike on Mohammed's home is one of many that have turned family homes into graves. On Saturday, another strike on a school building sheltering displaced Palestinians in Gaza City killed more than 70 people, adding to the mounting civilian death toll.As Mohammed Abu Al-Qumsan prays for his lost family, the world witnesses the tragic cost of war—a cost that has left countless families grieving in its wake, their lives forever changed by the violence that shows no sign of abating.",Mohammed Abu Al-Qumsan's twins Asser and Aysel were just four days old when they were killed in an Israeli airstrike.

The denial follows an Axios report suggesting Trump had urged Netanyahu to swiftly conclude the conflict with Hamas .According to reports, Trump while speaking at a New Jersey press conference, said he advised Netanyahu to “get it over with” and end the violence.The report also suggested that Trump also rejected the notion that he was pushing Netanyahu against a ceasefire deal. “You want to get it over with fast. Have victory, get your victory, and get it over with. It has to stop, the killing has to stop,” Trump was quoted as saying by the Times of Israel.The Axios report also suggested that Trump and Netanyahu had discussed the hostage situation in a recent call.However, both Netanyahu’s office and Trump have refuted this claim. ""Contrary to media reports, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not speak with former President Donald Trump,"" a statement from Netanyahu's office said.The report, in Axios, cited two US sources. One source said Trump's call was intended to encourage Netanyahu to take the deal, but stressed he did not know if this was indeed what the former president told Netanyahu. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Despite these denials, a new round of ceasefire negotiations is set for Thursday, involving Egypt, the US, and Qatar. Netanyahu’s office has confirmed ongoing negotiations, though Hamas announced it would not participate in the talks, with mediators expected to consult with the group afterward.The US views a Gaza ceasefire as crucial to preventing a broader Middle Eastern conflict. Recent tensions have escalated following the killings of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran and Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut, both of which prompted threats of retaliation against Israel.The ongoing conflict, sparked by Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, has resulted in 1,200 Israeli deaths and about 250 hostages. Israel’s retaliatory assault on Gaza has caused nearly 40,000 Palestinian deaths, displaced nearly 2.3 million people, and led to a severe humanitarian crisis.

Talks involving CIA Director William Burns commenced in Doha, Qatar, aiming to end a war that has devastated Gaza, displaced its population, and caused a severe humanitarian crisis.US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, ""Today is a promising start,"" but noted that ""there remains a lot of work to do."" Kirby confirmed that the talks are expected to continue on Friday.Hamas official Osama Hamdan stated that the group did not participate in Thursday's talks but was prepared to join the indirect negotiations if they resulted in new commitments from Israel . Hamdan emphasized that Hamas demands the implementation of a truce plan proposed in late May by US President Joe Biden.""If the mediators succeed in forcing the [Israeli] occupation to agree, we would, but so far there's nothing new,"" Hamdan told AFP. He added that Hamas would not engage in prolonged negotiations that ""give Netanyahu more time to kill the Palestinian people.""The only truce thus far occurred in November when Gaza militants released 105 hostages taken during the October 7 attack on Israel in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The latest push for diplomacy comes as Gaza's Health Ministry reported that the death toll has surpassed 40,000, which UN Chief Antonio Guterres described as ""yet another reason"" for a ceasefire now.""Given the... disturbing number of people who remain unaccounted for, who may be trapped or dead under the rubble, this number may, if anything, be an undercount,"" said Guterres' spokesman Farhan Haq. ""This is yet another reason why we need to have a ceasefire now, as well as the release of all hostages and unimpeded humanitarian assistance.""The Gaza Health Ministry's casualty figures include 40 deaths in the past 24 hours. The Israeli military has reported killing ""more than 17,000"" Palestinian militants since the beginning of the war.British Foreign Minister David Lammy and his French counterpart Stéphane Sejourne are scheduled to discuss the truce talks with Israel's top diplomat, Israel Katz, on Friday. During a visit to Beirut on Wednesday, US envoy Amos Hochstein stated that a deal in Gaza could enable a diplomatic resolution in Lebanon and prevent a broader conflict.""We have to take advantage of this window for diplomatic action and diplomatic solutions. That time is now,"" Hochstein said.Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel triggered the current war, resulting in 1,198 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. Militants also seized 251 people, of whom 111 are still held in Gaza, including 39 whom the military says are dead.Mediation efforts have repeatedly stalled since the week-long truce in November. Some Hamas officials, analysts, and critics in Israel have suggested that Netanyahu might be prolonging the war for political reasons.Israeli media recently quoted Defense Minister Yoav Gallant as stating privately to a parliamentary committee that a hostage release deal ""is stalling... in part because of Israel."" Netanyahu's office responded by accusing Gallant of adopting an ""anti-Israel narrative,"" stating that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar is ""the only obstacle to a hostage deal.""The renewed push for negotiations follows the July 31 killing of Sinwar's predecessor, Hamas political leader and truce negotiator Ismail Haniyeh, during a visit to Tehran. This event escalated fears of a broader conflict, as Iran and its regional allies blamed Israel and promised retaliation, although Israel has not claimed responsibility.Western leaders have urged Tehran to refrain from retaliating against Israel for Haniyeh's killing, which came hours after an Israeli strike in Beirut killed Hezbollah's military commander.The conflict's fallout has involved Iran-aligned groups from Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq, and Syria. Over 370 Hezbollah members have died in almost ten months of near-daily cross-border fire with Israeli forces, more than the group lost in the 2006 war with Israel. On the Israeli side, 22 soldiers and 26 civilians have died, including in the annexed Golan Heights, according to military figures.In Gaza, which has seen massive destruction of housing and infrastructure, relatively few casualties were reported on Thursday. The deadliest incident involved airstrikes that killed five people in Gaza City. Israel's military stated that troops killed about 20 militants in Rafah, southern Gaza.On Wednesday, many dead and wounded, including bloodied children, were brought to Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Yunis following an Israeli strike.""I was not pro-Hamas but now I support them and I want to fight,"" one grieving man shouted.","The United States announced a ""promising start"" to ceasefire talks in Gaza on Thursday.

Sinaloan authorities, in contrast, had said it appeared Cuen was killed at a gas station in Culiacan.In the statement, the attorney general's office said the investigation of Cuen's murder had been poorly conducted by state authorities and that the victim's body had four gunshot wounds whereas in a video circulated of the alleged gas station murder only one gunshot could be heard.The Sinaloan state attorney's office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.On Wednesday, Sinaloan prosecutors said they were also investigating the disappearance of two bodyguards who had not been seen since the day of the arrests.US ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar said last week that no US personnel were on the ground when Zambada and Guzman Lopez boarded the plane that took them to the US""No US resources were used in the surrender.

The decision was announced by Chief Judge William McConico of the 36th District Court, who stated that King would undergo ""necessary training"" to address the issues that led to the incident.The incident occurred when 15-year-old Eva Goodman, who was visiting King's courtroom as part of a field trip organized by The Greening of Detroit, a nonprofit organization, fell asleep. Judge King said he was more concerned about her attitude, which led him to have her wear jail clothes and handcuffs. ""I wanted this to look and feel very real to her, even though there’s probably no real chance of me putting her in jail,"" King told WXYZ-TV.Eva's mother, Latoreya Till, expressed her frustration, describing King as a ""big bully"" and noting that her daughter was scared and hurt by the experience. Till explained that her family lacks a permanent residence, and the previous night had been challenging, leading to her daughter's sleepiness in court.In response to the incident, McConico emphasised the court's commitment to providing a respectful and intimidation-free environment.

King, who has served as a judge since 2006, did not respond to a request for comment.Marissa Ebersole Wood, the chairperson of The Greening of Detroit, criticized King's approach, saying, ""Although the judge was trying to teach a lesson of respect, his methods were unacceptable. The group of students should have been simply asked to leave the courtroom if he thought they were disrespectful.""","Detroit Judge Kenneth King has been temporarily removed from the bench following an incident where he ordered a teenager to change into jail clothes and wear handcuffs during a court field trip.

Sangha is reportedly part of a criminal network that supplied Perry with ketamine, which led to his fatal overdose in October 2023.Prior to this high-profile case, Sangha was not widely known despite her alleged involvement in illegal activities.Reports have linked her to the 2019 overdose death of Cody McLaury, a 33-year-old Alaskan man who had lived in Los Angeles. McLaury's death, caused by a lethal combination of ketamine, heroin, methamphetamine, and cocaine, remained largely out of public awareness until now.The nickname ""Ketamine Queen"" was reportedly given to Sangha by detectives and investigators working on the Matthew Perry case. Sangha is believed to have played a key role in a large underground drug distribution network specializing in ketamine.According to law enforcement officials, on October 28, 2023, the day Perry died, his live-in assistant Kenneth Iwamasa injected him with ketamine, as he had done several times before, without possessing the proper medical licensure to perform such injections.Sangha was arrested in March in connection with a separate federal drug case but was released from custody after posting a $100,000 bond, according to court records.

Pakistan govt accuses ISI ex-chief of political interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-govt-accuses-isi-ex-chief-of-political-interference/articleshow/112504585.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement. Asif’s statement came hours after the military announced Hameed’s arrest, saying field court martial proceedings had been initiated against him.Speaking to a private news channel, Asif accused the retired general of violating the Army Act by interfering in politics in Dec 2022.The act bars officials from engaging in political activity for two years after retirement. “Gen Faiz was definitely involved in the events that took place in the political scene post his retirement,” the minister said.When asked about Hameed’s involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots by alleged supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, the minister said, “He might have provided a little bit of logistics and provided his experience of conspiracies, and may have defined targets for protesters to inflict maximum damage,” adding, “You can say he might have had the role of a strategic adviser in the May 9 attacks.”Following Imran’s brief arrest in a graft case last year, his supporters had attacked and damaged government and military assets. Hundreds of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers and politicians were arrested after the riots. Some still remain behind bars. The military has also initiated army court trials against more than 100 people accused of involvement in the May 9, 2023 violence.Gen Hameed’s arrest has sparked widespread speculation, with many linking the move to his close ties with Imran who has demanded the formation of a judicial commission to probe the ex-spymaster’s arrest to check if it was linked to the May 9 events.Many politicians accused Gen Hameed of using harsh methods and coercive techniques while serving as ISI chief to please his military and political superiors and achieve his own personal goals. Former PM Nawaz Sharif has repeatedly claimed that Hameed, a number of Supreme Court judges, and former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa were responsible for his ouster in 2017. Hameed was then leading an ISI wing concerned with domestic issues.Gen Hameed had replaced General Asim Munir, the current army chief, as ISI director-general in 2019. Gen Munir was unceremoniously fired by Imran when the latter was PM. The rivalry between these three individuals is partly to blame for Pakistan’s current political turmoil.As the spy agency’s head Gen Hameed had used his authority to threaten and detain Imran’s political rivals, including former PMs, on what they claimed were false accusations. He was seen by opposition politicians as a spy chief who had managed PTI’s past govt activities from behind the scenes.Both Hameed and Imran had approved the policy of repatriating Pakistani Taliban militants from Afghanistan back to Pakistan, which critics claim has led to the return of militancy to Pakistan. Hameed has also been perceived as a supporter of the Afghan Taliban, having backed their takeover of Kabul following the American withdrawal in Aug 2021.In Oct 2021, Gen Bajwa had removed Hameed as spy chief, prompting Khan to oppose the move before eventually agreeing. As a PM, Imran had publicly acknowledged that he wanted to retain Hameed as ISI chief because of the situation in Afghanistan.","Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif has said former Inter-Services Intelligence chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) was involved in political events after retirement.

Hameed has also been accused of multiple violations of the Pakistan Army Act after retirement.“Complying with the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry was undertaken by the Pakistan Army to ascertain the correctness of complaints in the Top City (housing society) case made against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd),” the military said in a statement.The management of Top City had accused the former ISI chief of orchestrating a raid on its offices and residence of its owner, Moeez Khan.

How case unfolded

Former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Faiz Hameed was arrested by Pakistan military in connection to a housing scheme scandal and the process for his court martial was initiated, the army said on Monday.It is for the first time in the country's history that court martial has been initiated against a former intelligence chief, according to Dawn .“Complying with the orders of Supreme Court of Pakistan, a detailed court of inquiry, was undertaken by Pakistan Army, to ascertain correctness of complaints in Top City case made against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd),” a press statement by Pakistan army said further adding that ""the process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated and Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) has been taken into military custody.”“Consequently, appropriate disciplinary action has been initiated against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), under provisions of Pakistan Army Act,” the release further said.Hameed was regarded as close aide to Imran Khan, who appointed him to lead the ISI during his tenure as prime minister. Khan was removed from office in 2022 through a vote of no-confidence, which he claims was orchestrated by the military, though the military denies this allegation.In 2022, Hameed was one of the six senior-most generals whose names were forwarded by general headquarters to Pakistani prime minister Shehbaz Sharif for consideration for the two top military positions. He, however, chose to seek early retirement and submitted his resignation to the high command, as per sources.The Supreme Court, in its order dated November 14 last year, had said that the allegations against Hameed were of ""extremely serious nature"" and ""would undermine the reputation of the federal government, the armed forces, ISI and Pakistan Rangers, therefore, they cannot be left unattended.”This came after the management of Top City, a private housing scheme, made allegations against the former spy-master, accusing him of orchestrating a raid on the offices and residence of its owner, Moeez Khan.The petition was filed on May 12, 2017, and it said that Pakistan Rangers and ISI officials conducted a raid on Top City's office and Moeez’s residence, seizing valuables such as gold and diamond jewelry and money in connection with an alleged terrorism case, Dawn reported.It also alleged the involvement of former ISI officials Irtaza Haroon, Sardar Najaf, Wasim Tabish, Zahid Mehmood Malik, and Mohammad Munir ""in the illegal takeover of the housing society”.In March, a court placed retired naib tehsildar Najaf Hameed, Hameed's brother, under a 14-day judicial remand.Najaf and other co-accused had sought pre-arrest bail in an FIR filed with the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) in Rawalpindi.The FIR alleged that former minister for mineral resources Hafiz Ammar Yasir had acquired properties worth billions of rupees through intermediaries.In April, the military had reportedly established an inquiry committee to investigate allegations of authority misuse involving the former ISI head.","Former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Faiz Hameed was arrested by Pakistan military in connection to a housing scheme scandal.
