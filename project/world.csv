"My career was made by the Gandhis & unmade by the Gandhis, says Aiyar",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/my-career-was-made-by-the-gandhis-unmade-by-the-gandhis-says-aiyar/articleshow/116348830.cms,"NEW DELHI: His political career was ""made by the Gandhis and unmade by the Gandhis,"" said veteran Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar in an interview, while asserting his continued commitment to the party. He also lamented that for 10 years, he was not given the opportunity to meet Sonia Gandhi one-on-one or spend any meaningful time with Rahul Gandhi, except for once.Reflecting on how he was ""completely isolated in the party"" even though he ""had it all"", Aiyar, in an interview with PTI news agency on his forthcoming book 'A Maverick in Politics', however, strongly professed his commitment to his party. ""I'll never shift, and I will certainly not go to BJP,"" he said.Aiyar also reflected on crucial developments in 2012 when Sonia Gandhi fell very ill and former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh had six bypasses. ""So, we were crippled at the head of the govt and at the head of the party. But there was one man who was still full of energy, full of ideas, had a certain amount of charisma, and could have run either the party or the govt or even both. And that was Pranab Mukherjee ,"" Aiyar is quoted in the interview.""If Manmohan Singh had become the President and Pranab had become the PM, I still think we would have lost in 2014 (Lok Sabha polls), but not by this massive humiliating defeat that we actually had, where we fell to 44 seats... "" Aiyar said.Asked about the patronage from the Gandhis, the Congress veteran said, ""I only had patronage. I had the favour of (former) prime minister Rajiv Gandhi. I then had the favour of Sonia Gandhi. But that's a very, very uncertain basis on which to be in politics. So when Sonia Gandhi got angry with me in 2010, that patronage got withdrawn. And yet not completely withdrawn."" ""So, it was a very slow decline. But it was a decline that took place over a period of about 15 years... ,"" Aiyar said.Aiyar, in the interview, goes on to detail several controversies, including the 2017 ""neech"" remark row and his subsequent suspension from the party. He narrates how his distance with the Gandhi family increased with that incident, saying one could date his fall precisely to Dec 7, 2017, when he had made the comment. He highlights that though the suspension was eventually revoked but the meeting with Rahul Gandhi did not materialise.","Mani Shankar Aiyar says his political career was ""made by the Gandhis and unmade by them"" He also lamented that for 10 years, he was not given the opportunity to meet Sonia Gandhi one-on-one or spend any meaningful time with Rahul Gandhi, except for once.

A US sheriff recounted his efforts to track the swarm of mystery drones hovering over his county, only to find that they “easily” evaded his attempts, the New York Post reported.Sheriff Michael Mastronardy of Ocean County explained that his office deployed an “industrial grade” drone on Thursday in an effort to follow one of the 50 unmanned aerial vehicles spotted by a local officer ""coming off the ocean.""The officer quickly notified state police, the FBI, and the US Coast Guard, leading to a report from Coast Guard officials of 13 drones with eight-foot wingspans trailing one of their vessels.Sheriff Mastronardy shared with News Nation reporter Rich McHugh that these unusual drones, which don’t emit heat like standard models, were able to swiftly evade capture.Talking about the mysterious objects, McHugh said, “If this is not our military, then it’s even more scary.""“These things look like they are fixed-wing and they have multiple lights. I’m not really sure how to process what I saw last night. Both the photographer and I were kind of stunned,” he added.Dozens of unidentified drones were spotted flying over New Jersey, including a recent sighting of more than 50 drones emerging from the Atlantic Ocean. The unexplained incidents left both the public and law enforcement puzzled, sparking calls for immediate action from state and federal authorities.The Ocean County sheriff ’s department is investigating the drones, which are described as fixed-wing aircraft with multiple lights and wingspans between 8 to 10 feet. These drones prove difficult to track, as they don’t emit heat like typical drones, hindering detection efforts.","Dozens of unidentified drones were spotted flying over New Jersey, including a recent sighting of more than 50 drones emerging from the Atlantic Ocean.

The strikes targeted military sites, including air defence units and surface-to-surface missile warehouses, causing several large explosions that were captured on video.The Observatory reported that the strikes devastated the base of the 23rd Air Defence Brigade and nearby facilities used to store advanced weaponry. ""The heaviest strikes in Syria's coastal region since the start of strikes in 2012,"" it said.Israel has long conducted airstrikes in Syria to prevent advanced weaponry from reaching hostile groups such as Hezbollah. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the strikes aim to thwart security threats and maintain stability along Israel’s northern border.

Deadly mistake

Investigation underway

Resort safety under scrutiny

A devastating incident at Georgia's popular Gudauri ski resort has left 12 people dead, with authorities suspecting carbon monoxide poisoning as the cause of the tragedy. The bodies of 11 foreign nationals and one Georgian citizen were found at an Indian restaurant at the resort, triggering an urgent investigation by Georgian police.The fatalities were discovered in the restaurant’s second-floor sleeping quarters, where the victims, believed to be staff members, had been staying. Authorities report that initial examinations of the bodies revealed no signs of external violence, suggesting that the cause of death was likely accidental. The Georgian interior ministry has opened a criminal investigation under Article 116 of Georgia's Criminal Code, which addresses deaths caused by negligence.According to early findings, the generator, which was positioned in a confined space next to the bedrooms, was turned on during a power outage the day before the bodies were found. The generator's placement in such a small, enclosed area raises concerns about safety and the risks of carbon monoxide buildup. Preliminary theories suggest that the toxic fumes from the generator, which would have been trapped in the closed space, could have caused the deaths.""The generator was placed in a confined area near the sleeping quarters, and the power outage the night before likely led to its use,"" said a spokesperson from the Georgian interior ministry. ""The circumstances around this tragic event are still under investigation, and forensic specialists are working to confirm the exact cause of death.""Witnesses are being questioned as part of the ongoing inquiry. Forensic experts have arrived at the scene, and a forensic medical examination has been ordered to establish the exact cause of death. The investigation is also focused on whether any criminal negligence played a role in the tragedy, particularly with regard to the use of the generator in such close proximity to the victims.""The investigation is actively underway,"" the ministry of internal affairs stated in a press release. ""We are conducting interviews and carrying out relevant examinations to determine the cause of this tragic incident.""The tragic event has raised serious questions about safety procedures at the resort, particularly concerning the use of generators in enclosed spaces. Local authorities are being pressed to reassess safety measures to ensure that such accidents do not happen again in the future.As the investigation unfolds, the families and loved ones of the victims are left to grapple with the devastating loss. The foreign nationals, whose identities have not yet been fully disclosed, were working in the restaurant, further adding to the emotional weight of the incident.","The bodies of 11 foreign nationals and one Georgian citizen were found at an Indian restaurant at the resort.

PATHANMTHITTA: Four members of a family, including a young couple, were killed in an accident at Murinjakal in Koodal, Pathanamthitta early on Sunday when their car collided with a bus carrying Sabarimala pilgrims from Telangana. The pilgrims were returning after darshan.The deceased are Mathai Eapan, 60; his son Nikhil, 30; daughter-in-law Anu, 26; and Anu's father Biju P George, 58, all hailing from Mallassery. The accident occurred just 7km away from their houses. A pilgrim travelling in the bus suffered an injury to his leg, but he was soon discharged from the hospital, and the group returned to Telangana by train.The accident occurred on the Punalur-Muvattupuzha Main Eastern Highway around 4.30am. Koodal police said Naveen and Anu had married on Nov 30 and were returning after a four-day honeymoon in Malaysia. Mathai and Biju had picked them up from Thiruvananthapuram airport and were returning home.Mini George of Sabson Quarters at Murinjakal in Koodal, who was the first person to reach the accident spot, said she was struggling to come out of the traumatic experience she had on Sunday morning.Mini said she had sleep issues and was lying awake on the bed when she heard a loud thud from the road in front of her house at 4.05am. “I rushed outside without awaking my husband and son. On the road, there was a fully destroyed car and a mini bus. Inside the car, there were four severely injured people with blood all over their bodies.They were not moving. I rushed back home and informed others. The images of the bodies are still fresh in my mind,” Mini said.“The four died in their sleep, without knowing what had happened. I know the family. The young couple lost their lives even before they started living together. Though Anu was breathing when police took her out of the car, my son said there was no hope as her head was badly injured. The car was in a bad condition, and there were no airbags. Accidents used to occur on this road very often. But this is the first time I have witnessed such a horrific accident with high casualties,” she added.Motor vehicles department officials who visited the spot said that the driver might have dozed off, resulting in the car veering off the left track and entering the right, causing the accident. “It was a 2012 model car with no airbags. As per the preliminary assessment, an inexperienced car driver, his age, and the odd time could have worked behind the accident. As they were returning from the airport, the driver might have dozed off for a second. This might be the cause,” an MVD official said.","The deceased are Mathai Eapan, 60; his son Nikhil, 30; daughter-in-law Anu, 26; and Anu's father Biju P George, 58, all hailing from Mallassery.

A powerful cyclone struck the French Indian Ocean archipelago of Mayotte , potentially causing a massive loss of life. A senior local French official stated on Sunday that the death toll could be in the hundreds or even thousands. This cyclone is considered the strongest to hit the region in nearly a century.Prefect Francois-Xavier Bieuville told broadcaster Mayotte la Premiere, “I think there will definitely be several hundred, perhaps we will come close to a thousand or even several thousand” deaths. He added that confirming the final death toll will be challenging because of Muslim burial customs.Determining accurate figures might also be further complicated by the estimated 100,000 undocumented residents, according to France's interior ministry. Former nurse Ousseni Balahachi reported that some individuals avoided seeking help, fearing deportation. Many remained in place until escape became impossible.The rescue operations are underway but face challenges due to damaged airports and power infrastructure in this French Indian Ocean territory. France is sending additional soldiers, firefighters, and medical personnel to Mayotte. Supplies, including medical equipment and blood for transfusions, are arriving by plane and ship from Reunion Island.The cyclone severely damaged hospitals and schools, according to Mamoudzou Mayor Ambdilwahedou Soumaila. He told AFP that nine people were in critical condition, and 246 others were seriously injured. He described the situation as devastating.The storm also destroyed shantytowns housing a significant portion of the island's population, including many undocumented residents. Some were afraid to seek help, fearing deportation, according to former nurse Ousseni Balahachi.""Honestly, what we are experiencing is a tragedy, you feel like you are in the aftermath of a nuclear war… I saw an entire neighborhood disappear,"" Mohamed Ishmael, a resident of Mayotte's capital Mamoudzou, told Reuters.Cyclone Chido also hit the Comoros Islands, causing minor damage. It then made landfall in Mozambique, where three deaths have been reported. The remnants of the storm are expected to bring heavy rain to Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Zambia, possibly leading to floods.EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen offered support on Sunday. ""Our hearts go out to France following the devastating passage of cyclone Chido through Mayotte,"" she posted on X. ""We are ready to provide support in the days to come.""WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed readiness to assist, stating on X that his organisation ""stands ready to support communities in need of essential health care"". PIROI, the regional Red Cross organisation, also indicated its preparedness to help.The cyclone destroyed informal settlements, as reported by Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau.Authorities ordered Mayotte's 320,000 residents into lockdown as the cyclone approached with winds reaching 226 kilometres per hour. The storm caused extensive infrastructure damage, particularly affecting shantytown dwellings.Emergency response efforts are underway, with medical supplies and personnel arriving by air and sea. The storm has also affected Mozambique, causing three deaths, while UNICEF provides assistance there.The UN warns that 1.7 million people face risk, with potential flooding in Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Zambia.Experts link this cyclone to climate change, with meteorologist Francois Gourand noting its intensity was enhanced by unusually warm Indian Ocean temperatures.",Cyclone Chido struck the French Indian Ocean archipelago of Mayotte.

'Don't regret supporting impeachment': South Korean ruling party leader Han



'Ringleader of rebellion'



South Korean defence ministry on Monday revealed that over 1,500 troops were deployed during the December 3 martial law imposed by now impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol.Meanwhile, a constitutional court began reviewing the impeachment of President Yoon on Monday over his attempt to implement martial law, according to a court spokesperson.Meanwhile, Yoon and several senior officials are under investigation for potential charges of insurrection related to the brief martial law.South Korea ruling party leader Han Dong-hoon announced on Monday that he was stepping down and added that he did not regret supporting President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment despite backlash from his party.""I step down as the leader of the People Power Party,"" he said, adding, ""I sincerely apologise to all the people who have suffered due to the emergency martial law incident.""Han spoke with US President Joe Biden on Sunday, reaffirming the strength of bilateral relations.

Chinese President Xi Jinping says ‘inevitable’ for ruling party to have internal conflicts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinese-president-xi-jinping-says-inevitable-for-ruling-party-to-have-internal-conflicts/articleshow/116350527.cms,"File photo: Reuters

Chinese President Xi Jinping dismissed internal divisions within the ruling Communist Party as unavoidable, while calling for greater efforts to instill discipline, according to newly disclosed remarks he made at an anti-graft meeting in January.“Changes in the external environment and in the party membership will inevitably lead to various conflicts and problems within the party,” Xi said at the annual huddle of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection . “It is necessary to eliminate all kinds of negative influences in a timely manner with the courage of turning the blade inward to ensure that the party is always full of vigor and vitality.”The top leader’s remarks were revealed in the Communist Party journal Qiushi on Sunday, just weeks after another high-ranking military official was abruptly suspended from duty — that ousting was notable as Miao Hua has been considered a Xi loyalist. Other parts of Xi’s speech were previously reported by Xinhua in January, without such details.China’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong is deepening an anti-corruption campaign that he’s used to root out unscrupulous officials and eliminate political rivals since taking office in 2012. That drive has ensnared a record number of senior officials for two straight years, and set off a purge that’s still roiling the defense establishment.That widening crackdown has contributed to bureaucratic paralysis as officials scared of making mistakes refrain from taking risks to boost the nation’s slowing economy. Top leaders appear aware of the issue, as they last week reiterated the need to fully implement the party’s instructions and step up “positive incentives” for local officials.The party doesn’t disclose all speeches delivered by Xi in full, and often releases them months — or even years — after the fact, sometimes as a way to signal policy priorities. The Qiushi article on Sunday also urged to “remove viruses that erode the healthy body of the party” in order to consolidate the Communist Party’s legitimacy.","Chinese President Xi Jinping dismissed internal divisions within the ruling Communist Party as unavoidable.

MAGA conspiracy theories link drone sightings to Project Blue Beam: Is US govt preparing a fake alien invasion?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/maga-conspiracy-theories-link-drone-sightings-to-project-blue-beam-is-us-govt-preparing-a-fake-alien-invasion/articleshow/116350016.cms,"A swarm of drones lighting up the night sky over the US East Coast has ignited a firestorm of speculation, with conspiracy theorists racing to the forefront with wild claims of government plots, alien invasions, and military cover-ups.The sightings, which began on Nov. 18 near Morris County, New Jersey, have now spread across six states, including New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia, leaving a trail of confusion and fear.While federal agencies, including the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, have dismissed these incidents as non-threatening to national security or public safety, the internet is abuzz with more outlandish explanations.Comedian Roseanne Barr is among the most vocal, connecting the mysterious drones to a decades-old conspiracy theory known as Project Blue Beam .This theory, popularized by Infowars founder Alex Jones, suggests that the government is preparing to stage a fake alien invasion as a means to control the population through mass panic and authoritarian rule. Barr believes the drone sightings mark the beginning of this staged event.""Now you see why I mention Project Blue Beam every week on my podcast,"" Barr tweeted on Saturday, fanning the flames of paranoia.Jones, known for championing conspiracy theories, gave his endorsement to Project Blue Beam last week during an interview with ufologist Dr Steven Greer. Greer, a retired physician, voiced his concerns over the alleged plans of global elites, claiming they want to control the world through crises like a fabricated alien invasion.“They all have this agenda to want to control the world through one calamity after the other, and the big one they’ve been planning is the hoax of an alien threat from outer space,” Greer warned on the Infowars show.Meanwhile, Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, no stranger to controversial statements, has also weighed in on the mysterious drones, accusing the government of withholding the truth. On Saturday, Greene posted her belief that the drones are being controlled by the government, hiding the real purpose of their presence.“The government is in control of the drones and refuses to tell the American people what is going on. It really is that bad,” Greene wrote on X (formerly Twitter).In another post, Greene lent her support to a theory suggesting that the drones might be part of a military training program, possibly designed for future drone warfare. ""However, the government needs to come clean and tell the American people what is going on. That’s the most infuriating part to me,” Greene added.Theories of extraterrestrial involvement have also surfaced. Daily Wire commentator Matt Walsh raised the possibility of alien activity behind the drones, fueling even more speculation among followers.But some lawmakers believe the threat is much closer to home. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican, took the dramatic step of claiming that the drones could be linked to Iran. In an interview with Fox News, he warned that the drones might be launched from an Iranian ""mothership,"" alleging that the Pentagon is hiding this information from the American public.“We aren’t being told the truth,” Van Drew told Fox News. “They are dealing with the American public like we’re stupid.”The Pentagon swiftly denied these claims. Spokesperson Sabrina Singh addressed the allegations, saying, ""There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there’s no so-called mothership launching drones towards the United States.""As the drones continue to perplex authorities and residents alike, pressure from local officials is mounting. New York Governor Kathy Hochul called for increased federal intervention, citing a shutdown of Stewart Airfield due to drone activity.“This has gone too far,” Hochul said. “The Biden Administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer echoed this call for action, demanding answers. ""I’m pushing for answers amid these drone sightings,"" Schumer said in a statement on Saturday. He also noted that it was ""remarkable"" that the public still had more questions than answers.As tensions rise and speculation spreads, the mystery surrounding the drones remains unsolved. Is it an elaborate government cover-up , an extraterrestrial warning, or simply a case of malfunctioning military technology? Only time will tell, but for now, the skies above the East Coast are as enigmatic as ever.","Sightings began on Nov. 18 near Morris County, New Jersey, and have now spread across six states.

Donald Trump critic Republican senator Mitt Romney said his stance against Donald Trump has not changed since 2016 but he believes that the President-elect deserves a chance. The Utah Republican, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, told CNN that MAGA has become the Republican Party and the party is synonymous to Donald Trump today. Romney said in 2016 he felt that Trump was wrong for the country and the party and considered his win impossible but he was wrong.“I agree with him (Trump) on a lot of policy fronts. I disagree with him on some things,” Romney said of Trump. “But it’s like, OK, give him a chance to do what he said he’s gonna do and see how it works out.”Romney said he does not fear that his open stance against Trump would make him a target for political retribution as he believes that Trump would now try and focus on the future.Notwithstanding his dislike for Trump, Romney said vice-president-elect JD Vance is a smart person and very well-spoken. “If you were to ask me who the nominee will be in 2028, I think it will be JD Vance, all right? He’s smart, well-spoken, part of the MAGA movement,” Romney said, downplaying past criticism of Vance as comments from “long ago,” and saying, “I’m not going to rehash history, and we’ve worked together in the Senate together since then.”Romney said Trump deserves the credit for bringing working-class voters to the GOP from Democrats. “Look, the Republican Party has become the party of the working-class, middle-class voter, and you’ve got to give Donald Trump credit for having done that, taking that away from the Democrats,” he said.On his unsuccessful campaign against Obama in 2012, he said Obama was ""“in some respects smart to go after me and say, ‘Here’s a rich business guy, we’re going to characterize him as a plutocrat that doesn’t care about people.’ He went with that narrative, put it out there before I could really effectively respond and was successful in doing so.”",Romney said in 2016 he felt that Trump was wrong for the country and the party and considered his win impossible but he was wrong.

Trump Jr's public show of support

Kimberly Guilfoyle and Donald Trump Jr have reportedly parted ways, with sources claiming Guilfoyle’s fashion choices played a key role in their split. According to a Trump insider quoted by The Daily Beast, Trump Jr sought a new partner who could better win over his father, Donald Trump, and align with his expectations.Last week, Trump Jr was spotted holding hands with Palm Beach socialite and former model Bettina Anderson, signaling a new chapter in his love life. Reports by People indicate that Guilfoyle and Trump Jr's relationship had already been under strain for months, with Anderson entering the picture about six months ago. Sources suggest Trump Jr even took Anderson on a trip to Alaska while still in a relationship with Guilfoyle.A political insider revealed that Trump Jr had voiced dissatisfaction with Guilfoyle’s wardrobe, describing it as “too stiff” and “always professional.” Her signature look—brightly colored, form-fitting dresses paired with high heels — didn’t align with his vision. “Don Jr has been telling people for months that Kim is so uptight and never looks relaxed or casual. The tight dresses need to go, and she has been told that,” the source told People.Trump Jr's pursuit of Anderson reportedly stems from her ability to fit into the Waspy, high-society circles of Palm Beach—something that appeals to his desire to impress his father. “Someone like Bettina, who is and has been a model, is exactly the kind of person who would win over Donald Sr,” a source close to the Trump family told The Independent.Interestingly, Anderson reportedly pushed for Guilfoyle to be sent abroad as her relationship with Trump Jr grew. On Wednesday, Guilfoyle was named US Ambassador to Greece by Donald Trump. Sources said this decision was delayed until after the elections to avoid impacting Donald Trump Sr's campaign. “They waited for the election to pass but didn’t want the split to hurt Donald in any way,” a political source explained as reported by the People.Despite the swirling rumors, Trump Jr publicly praised Guilfoyle’s appointment on X (formerly Twitter), calling her “a fantastic America First leader.” The couple, who began dating in 2018 following Trump Jr's divorce from Vanessa Trump, has not commented on the split.As of now, Trump Jr appears focused on his future with Anderson, while Guilfoyle embraces her new role as ambassador. Whether the rift stemmed from fashion or other factors, one thing is certain—the Trump family drama never fails to captivate.","Kimberly Guilfoyle and Donald Trump Jr have reportedly parted ways.

Drones mystery: Andrew Tate demands answers from Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/drones-mystery-andrew-tate-demands-answers-from-musk-explain-elon/articleshow/116349237.cms,"""Please explain the drones"": Andrew Tate's viral plea to Elon Musk amid growing speculation

Elon Musk on modern warfare: Fighter jets obsolete, drones are the future

Drone sightings create public alarm

Authorities, lawmakers address growing concerns

Public remains skeptical

Amid growing speculation about mysterious drones flying over New Jersey and the East Coast that have captured national attention, controversial British-American influencer Andrew Tate took to Twitter to demand answers from SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.Tate’s tweet, now viral, read: “Hello @elonmusk. You have SpaceX and speak to the most important people in the world. Please explain the drones. Thanks, The World.” Musk has yet to respond.Notably, billionaire entrepreneur Musk, recently selected by US President-elect Donald Trump to spearhead efforts to reduce federal government spending, made waves with his bold critique of modern fighter jets and his endorsement of drone warfare.“Manned fighter jets are obsolete in the age of drones anyway. Will just get pilots killed,” Musk wrote on his social media platform, X, where he also leads companies like SpaceX and Tesla.In a series of posts, Musk specifically targeted the F-35 Lightning II, calling it a “shit design” and pointing to consistent manufacturing and performance issues outlined in declassified Pentagon testing reports. He argued that drone swarms controlled by AI hive minds represent the future of air combat.“Meanwhile, some idiots are still building manned fighter jets like the F-35,” Musk commented in a post on November 24, alongside a video showing hundreds of drones flying in coordinated formation. In a follow-up post, Musk elaborated, “The F-35 design was broken at the requirements level, because it was required to be too many things to too many people. This made it an expensive & complex jack of all trades, master of none. Success was never in the set of possible outcomes.”His remarks had real-world consequences, as Lockheed Martin, the F-35's primary contractor, saw its stock drop by over 3% following Musk’s comments.Notably, Musk’s statements align with his growing advocacy for unmanned combat systems, which he argues will revolutionize warfare while saving lives. The tech magnate has been vocal about the inefficiency of manned aircraft and has repeatedly emphasized the inevitability of AI-controlled drones dominating the battlefield.The Pentagon has yet to respond to Musk's remarks, but his influence on the defense industry and public opinion is undeniable.Residents in southern and northern New Jersey have described seeing brightly lit objects moving swiftly and emitting a humming noise. In Elsinboro, Susan and Lorelai Woodruff reported nightly visits from these objects since late November.""I feel like our privacy is invaded,"" said Lorelai, 52. Portrait photographer Jenna Keen, also from Elsinboro, started a Facebook group to track the sightings, which gained over 600 members within hours.For many, the unexplained drones have disrupted daily life. Mendham resident Emily Ferguson shared that her children have started closing blinds out of fear. “The kids are asking, ‘What’s going on?’ and I don’t have answers,” she said.Others, like Michael Ash of Westfield, have observed multiple objects within minutes. “This is such a widespread phenomenon; it’s impossible to ignore,” Ash stated.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas sought to reassure the public, stating, ""Some of those drone sightings are, in fact, drones. Some are manned aircraft mistaken for drones. Right now, we are not aware of any malicious activity.""Still, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have criticized federal agencies for their lack of transparency. Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer has called for immediate deployment of drone-detection systems in New York and New Jersey, emphasizing, “We need more tools to address this issue.”Meanwhile, Governor Kathy Hochul announced that New York has begun receiving drone-detection technology but urged Congress to pass legislation granting local law enforcement greater authority to address drone threats.Former President Donald Trump weighed in, calling for immediate action: “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!”Despite reassurances, residents remain uneasy. “It’s unnerving to walk out your door and see this,” said Kieran Kelly, a Morristown technology consultant. Ferguson echoed the frustration: “Officials are trying to gaslight us, acting like we’re conspiracy theorists.”With theories ranging from extraterrestrial activity to military operations, social media remains flooded with videos and debates. Andrew Tate’s public plea to Musk has added another layer of intrigue to the growing mystery.For now, the origins of these drones remain unclear, leaving East Coast residents to wonder: What’s next in the skies above?",Controversial British-American influencer Andrew Tate took to Twitter to demand answers from SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

Former governor of New Jersey Chris Christie said he noticed several drones over his house and this happened for the first time while he stayed in New Jersey his whole life. He slammed the administration for downplaying the entire mystery sighting of drones in New Jersey and said it's just wrong to say this is not unusual activity.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on ABC News said the sightings were not any threat to the people and there was no unusual activity. Christie reacted to the statement and said now ""drone vigilantes"" may soon start taking matters into their own hands.“I have lived in New Jersey my whole life. This is the first time that I’ve noticed drones over my house. And I was in a restaurant in Monmouth County on Friday night, had people at the bar coming up to me and saying, Governor Murphy won’t tell me anything. The president won’t tell me anything. Do you know? Like, well, I don’t know,” Christie said.“If you don’t fill that vacuum, all the conspiracy theories get filled in there,” he said. “You’ve got people like Congressman Jeff Van drew saying there’s an Iranian mothership off the coast of New Jersey. Absolutely not true, and provably now not true, and he’s had to back off that.”“You can’t have conspiracy theorists filling the space, but the Biden administration and state authorities have to be more vocal and let people know exactly what they’re doing,” he added.“It’s a newish technology to most people, and they’re worried about it and concerned. And to the extent they’re following things around the world, they hear about drones being deployed in Ukraine all the time as weapons, and us deploying drones as weapons at times. So you can see why people are concerned.”Christie spoke about the drone mystery as President-elect Donald Trump trolled Christie with an AI-generated meme of drones appearing to deliver McDonald's food to Christie. Christie and Trump were allies but after Trump claimed to have won the 2020 election, their equation tanked.","Former governor of New Jersey Chris Christie said he noticed several drones over his house and this happened for the first time while he stayed in New Jersey his whole life.

Amid a spate of speculations and conspiracy theories over drones spotted above New Jersey, state senator Jon Bramnick said the feds are hiding the truth about the drones because they are scared of the reaction of the public if they come clean about these. Bramnick said the government is calling them harmless and the public reaction 'overreaction' because they don't want the public to know the truth.What's the truth then? The senator said there ""must be something going on"" because it's not possible that the Department of Defense does not know what's going on. “Why would the government allow the public to be so frustrated? Why would the government allow a United States senator to be so frustrated? We heard this from both sides of the aisle,” he said.President-elect Donald Trump spoke out about the mystery sighting and called for shooting those mystery drones down.

Though Khan was released after three days, he was rearrested two months later in another corruption case and has been in jail since. There have been widespread reports that the military also plans to prosecute him under the same charges. He, however, has already been indicted by an anti-terrorism court over charges linked to the May 9 riots.The seven-member SC constitution bench was formed as a result of a controversial amendment to the constitution in Oct this year.“The final judgment of 85 persons who are under custody and facing trial before the military courts be announced and remissions admissible to the said persons be granted, and persons who can be released after remissions they be released forthwith, and persons who have to yet undergo the sentence awarded to them, their custody be handed over to the concerned jail authorities,” Friday’s court order read.The Pakistan Army Act of 1952 had established military courts, which function under a separate legal system, primarily for trial of military personnel or enemies of the state.The decision to use military courts for civilians was taken by Imran’sadversary, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during his first term in office, and was backed by the powerful military establishment.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in May 9 riots.

Bin Laden, Tehran and the Taliban



'Murdered my dreams'



PARACHINAR: Once again, Ali Ghulam receives mourners at his home -- his brother and nephew killed 40 years apart in the same sectarian conflict that was reignited this year in northwest Pakistan, claiming 200 lives since July alone.Thousands of residents are stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district, which borders Afghanistan, as the government struggles to end clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stemming from decades-old tensions over farmland.""Our generations yearn for peace,"" 72-year-old Ghulam told AFP at his home in Parachinar, the main town and a Shiite bastion of the restive district.The latest flare-up of violence has ""reopened wounds"" he said, recalling how his brother was killed in an attack in 1987 that also wounded another three of his brothers.Kurram, known as the ""Parrot's Beak"" for its protrusion into neighbouring Afghanistan, is bounded by dizzyingly high mountains, the northern flank of which includes the Tora Bora caves where Al Qaeda founder and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden once hid.Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for various militant groups, with militants and weapons able to flow largely unchecked in and out of Afghanistan.""I have never experienced peace in my life and have no hope my coming generations will live free of fear,"" Ghulam said.Tribal and family feuds are common in Pakistan.But they can be particularly protracted and violent in the mountainous tribal northwest, where communities live by traditional codes of honour and revenge.The latest round of violence in Kurram erupted in May and intensified in July, when gunmen opened fire on a council of elders attempting to settle the latest round of disagreements over land.Various truces announced since then have held for only weeks or days at a time.More than 300 shops and over 200 homes in Sunni areas have been destroyed, often by fire, and hundreds of families have fled.Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country with Shiites making up 10 to 15 percent of the population, or at least 25 million people.Members of the two sects have periodically clashed in Kurram, where Shiites are particularly vulnerable as they must pass through Sunni-majority neighbourhoods to access essential services.Kurram's location on the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan put it at the heart of the religious and political upheavals of the last five decades.In 1979, Shiites led a revolution in Iran and later that year the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, prompting Sunni hardliners there to rise up against them.Pakistan's military ruler Zia-ul-Haq aligned with them, funnelling thousands of Sunni militants into Afghanistan through Kurram.""It became a hub for arms supply to Afghanistan, including landmines, mortar shells, and weapons of all kinds. Every household in Kurram had a stockpile of weapons,"" Malik Attaullah Khan, a local tribal elder told AFP.Khan, who signed a 2007 agreement aimed at bringing peace to Kurram, criticised the government for failing to ""fulfil in its responsibilities"" in enforcing land settlements.The ethnic Pashtun heartland was merged into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in 2018, but the Pakistani state maintains limited control in the merged districts.In rural areas of Pakistan, villages often bypass the formal justice system and men-only ""jirgas"" or councils made up of respected village elders resolve disputes, sometimes in the form of fines or land reallocation.Ghulam's nephew was killed along with at least 42 others last month, when Sunni gunmen opened fire on a convoy of Shiites being escorted by the police to their homes.In retaliation, a market in a Sunni-dominated area was set on fire.Syed Ghani Shah told AFP his cousin was burned to death inside his shop.""When we buried him, he was so unrecognisable that we couldn't even let his parents see his face,"" Shah said.""Can we ever make peace after all this? Never, if we ever get the chance, we will surely avenge our blood,"" he warned.Authorities have enforced curfews and road closures to reduce the chances of violence breaking out, providing escorts through high-risk areas and using helicopters to deliver supplies.But Akbar Khan, a representative of Pakistan's independent Human Rights Commission told AFP that the state needs to do more to resolve the issue.""In the past, jirgas were successful because they had the full support of the state. Now, the authorities don't even provide the expenses needed to hold a jirga,"" he said.Fatima Ahmed's husband was killed last month while travelling to Islamabad to arrange her admission to medical college.""I don't want to live a life without him. I've lost my will to exist,"" the 21-year-old told AFP.""They haven't just martyred my husband -- they've also murdered my dreams with him,"" she said, bursting into tears.",Violence in northwest Pakistan has killed 200 people since July.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges, including engaging in political activities and violating a law on official secrets, during field general court martial (FGCM) proceedings against him, military's media affairs wing said Tuesday.Army's media arm ISPR said FGCM also charged Hameed with compromising state security and interests, abusing authority and resources and causing undue harm to individuals. ISPR said proceedings against Hameed were initiated on Aug 12 under provisions of Pakistan Army Act.Hameed, who served as ISI director-general from June 2019 to Oct 2021, was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. He was arrested over accusations about his involvement in land grabbing and snatching valuables and property from the owner of a private housing society. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable in a country where powerful generals have long wielded unparalleled influence in state affairs.""During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (Retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading up to multiple incidents including but not limited to the May 9, 2023 incident for fomenting instability, at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,"" ISPR said. The May 9 incident referred to countrywide protests when PTI supporters stormed army installations and govt buildings following the arrest of party chief and ex-PM Imran Khan for alleged graft. To many, Hameed's close association with Khan was the reason behind his arrest. Khan wanted to continue with Hameed as ISI head but then army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had been adamant on replacing him. Bajwa eventually succeeded and Khan could serve only a few months in office; he was later removed through a no-confidence.Independent observers say action against Hameed could put Khan under pressure and pave the way for the ex-PM to face a military court on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military.","Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries. According to the data, he has been booked in 99 cases in Punjab, 76 in Islamabad and two in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.",Imran Khan has asked his supporters to converge in Peshawar on Dec 13.

Growing threat from Baloch separatists

Sectarian violence fuels instability

Border tensions and counterterrorism efforts

What lies ahead

Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month, according to a report by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). The number of fatalities also surged by 69%, climbing from 100 in October to 169, with 225 others injured.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a banned group, carried out 12 attacks in November, including three high-impact incidents that resulted in 45 deaths. These figures surpassed the fatalities caused by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), indicating a shift in the BLA's operational strategy. Experts suggest this escalation requires a reassessment of counterterrorism tactics.The majority of these attacks in Balochistan targeted security forces and civilians. Notable incidents included an assault on the Quetta railway station, an attack on a police van in Mastung, and a strike on a security check-post in Kalat, which collectively accounted for 91% of the province’s fatalities.Sectarian violence added another layer to the country's security challenges, particularly in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Seven incidents, including two terror attacks and five sectarian clashes, claimed 115 lives and left 137 injured. The violence was triggered by an attack on passenger buses on November 21, which spiraled into broader sectarian unrest.KP remained the most affected province, with 41 terrorist attacks leading to 114 deaths and 95 injuries. The TTP, Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-i-Islam, and other local factions were linked to most of these incidents.The report also highlighted six incidents of border violence along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, resulting in 25 terrorist deaths and 11 injuries. This underscores the ongoing instability in the region and the challenges posed by cross-border insurgents.Security forces conducted 19 counterterrorism operations in November, killing 53 terrorists. Most of these operations were concentrated in KP and Balochistan, the epicenters of recent violence.The PIPS report paints a grim picture of Pakistan's security landscape, with 98 conflict-related incidents causing 338 deaths and 411 injuries in November alone. Experts suggest that the evolving nature of terror threats, including the increasing lethality of BLA operations and persistent sectarian tensions, requires urgent and innovative policy responses.As Pakistan grapples with these challenges, the question remains: can the state adapt quickly enough to address the multifaceted threats destabilizing the country?","Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month.

NEW DELHI: An inquiry commission in Bangladesh said on Saturday that deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, along with high-ranking officials of her government, were involved in alleged incidents of enforced disappearances. The commission, set up by the interim government of Muhammad Yunus, implicated Hasina in as many as 3,500 cases of forced disappearances.""The commission has found evidence of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's involvement as the instructor in the incidents of enforced disappearances,"" Muhammad Yunus' government said in a statement on Saturday.The report, titledpresented preliminary evidence against Hasina, who fled the country following a student-led uprising.The statement also claimed that many high-ranking officials, including former military and police personnel believed to be involved, fled abroad after the fall of Hasina's Awami League government on August 5.The investigative commission, informed the interim government that their inquiries uncovered a ""systematic design"" that enabled incidents of enforced disappearances to occur unnoticed.Further, it said that the elite anti-crime unit, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB)—comprising personnel from the army, navy, air force, and regular police—along with other law enforcement agencies, had collaborated to detain, torture, and hold victims in secret facilities.On these lines, the commission recommended abolishing the RAB and called for either repealing or significantly amending the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2009 .In a prior press briefing, the commission disclosed the existence of eight secret detention centers in and around Dhaka. They informed Yunus that they would issue another interim report in March and estimated it would take at least another year to thoroughly investigate all the allegations received.""You are doing an exceptionally important job. We are fully prepared to offer you any support you need,"" Yunus was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.","An inquiry commission in Bangladesh said on Saturday that deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, along with high-ranking officials of her government, were involved in alleged incidents of enforced disappearances.

Taliban minister killed in Kabul suicide bombing in ministry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-minister-killed-in-kabul-suicide-bombing-in-ministry/articleshow/116223724.cms,"Khalil-ur-Rehman Haqqani (Reuters file photo)

ISLAMABAD: Afghan Taliban acting minister for refugees and repatriation Khalil-ur-Rehman Haqqani was killed along with four others in a suicide bombing inside his ministry’s building in central Kabul on Wednesday, Taliban authorities said.This is the first time a high-profile sitting minister has been killed since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in August 2021. Khalil (58) was a key member of the Haqqani network , which led a violent insurgency against the US and its allies before the American withdrawal in 2021. He was the brother of the late Jalaluddin Haqqani, founder of the Haqqani network, and the uncle of incumbent interior (home) minister Sirajuddin Haqqani.No group had claimed responsibility for the attack at the time of going to press but Taliban officials face opposition from ISKP (Islamic State Khurasan Province), and from the National Resistance Front, an anti-Taliban movement led by former officials of the previous toppled Afghan government.CNN quoted a ministry spokesperson as saying a suicide bomber disguised as a visitor had gained access to the building and had detonated the bomb while Haqqani was signing paperwork.In the early days of the takeover, Khalil was one of the key figures who had engaged with other Afghan leaders, including former president Hamid Karzai, ex-chief executive Abdullah Abdullah and Hizb-e-Islami chief Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.“We have received with great sadness the news that the minister of refugees of the Islamic Emirate, Khalil-ur-Rahman Haqqani, was martyred this afternoon in a barbaric attack by the Kharijites (enemies),” said a statement issued by Kabul police, adding that four others were also killed in the explosion. According to reports from Kabul, the death toll could escalate as several people have been admitted to local hospitals.Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban administration’s chief spokesman, said Haqqani was killed in an explosion at the ministry of refugees and repatriation in Kabul. Mujahid said that “infidels” who claim to be Muslims were responsible for Wednesday’s attack. In a post on ‘X’, he called the killing an “irreparable loss to the Islamic Emirate”, using the Taliban’s official name for Afghanistan.Speaking to TOI, Afghan journalist Nur Rehman Sherzad said Haqqani’s assassination took place in one of the most secure places under his supervision. “Since it would be difficult to break the ministry’s strong security, it is likely that someone from his inner circle, or with their participation, carried out the attack,” Sherzad added.Mujahid cited a US reward of up to $5 million for information on Khalil Haqqani, who it had classified as a specially designated global terrorist in 2011, but he did not explicitly blame the US authorities for his apparent assassination. The Taliban spokesperson vowed that such cowardly acts would not weaken the resolve of Muslims nor help the conspirators achieve their “evil goals” against their Islamic system. Instead, he said, such actions only darken the faces of the enemies of Islam and expose their malicious intentions.Although the Haqqanis have long held sway inside the Taliban, they recently seemed to lose ground due to rumours of a falling out between Sirajuddin Haqqani and Taliban regime head Hibatullah Akhundzada.",Khalil-ur-Rehman Haqqani was killed along with four others in a suicide bombing inside his ministry’s building in central Kabul.
