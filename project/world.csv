Tiger reserves stand on a higher pedestal than national parks and sanctuaries. Whatever protection is accorded to national parks and sanctuaries would automatically apply to tiger reserves, which would also require additional protection.""Bhati told the court that the state has already expanded the area of Sariska Wildlife Sanctuary and taken necessary protective measures. The mining activities have been taking place since the 1970s and these are outside the CTH.The Justice Gavai-led green bench said whatever activity is taking place within the buffer zone of tiger reserves needs to be shifted out and cited the examples of Tadoba and Melghat tiger reserves where all villages inside the tiger habitats have been shifted out.""How can there be mining activity within one km of CTH?

Putin arrives in Beijing seeking greater support for war effort,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/putin-arrives-in-beijing-seeking-greater-support-for-war-effort/articleshow/110160973.cms,"Transactions slow

BEJING: Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in China on Thursday to meet with counterpart Xi Jinping as he seeks greater support from Beijing for his war effort in Ukraine and his isolated economy.This is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election and the second in just over six months to China, an economic lifeline for Russia after the West hit it with unprecedented sanctions over its military offensive in Ukraine.Putin was greeted by Chinese officials and an honour guard as he got off his plane at around dawn for the two-day state visit, Russian television footage showed.The Russian leader's arrival came hours after he hailed his country's troops for advancing on ""all fronts"" on the battlefield in Ukraine, following a major new ground assault.Xi, who returned last week from a three-nation tour of Europe, has rebuffed Western criticism of his country's ties with Moscow, enjoying cheap Russian energy imports and access to vast natural resources, including steady gas shipments via the Power of Siberia pipeline.It is a relationship the leaders described in 2022 as one of ""no limits"".""This is Putin's first trip after his inauguration, and it is therefore intended to show that Sino-Russian relations are moving up another level,"" independent Russian political analyst Konstantin Kalachev told AFP.""Not to mention the visibly sincere personal friendship between the two leaders.""But as the economic partnership comes under close scrutiny in the West, Chinese banks fearing US sanctions that might cut them off from the global financial system have begun turning the screws on Russian businesses.The Kremlin this week said the two leaders would discuss their ""comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation"" as well as ""define key areas of development of Russian-Chinese cooperation and exchange views on international and regional issues"".Putin, in an interview published in Xinhua ahead of his visit, also hailed Beijing's ""genuine desire"" to help resolve the Ukraine crisis.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who met Xi in Beijing last month, warned China's support for Russia's ""brutal war of aggression"" in Ukraine had helped Russia ramp up production of rockets, drones and tanks -- while stopping short of direct arms exports.China claims to be a neutral party in the Ukraine conflict and the foreign ministry in Beijing said the two leaders will exchange views on ""bilateral ties, cooperation in various fields, and international and regional issues of common interest"".China-Russia trade has boomed since the Ukraine invasion and hit $240 billion in 2023, according to Chinese customs figures.But after Washington vowed to go after financial institutions that facilitate Moscow, Chinese exports to Russia dipped during March and April, down from a surge early in the year.An executive order by President Joe Biden in December permits secondary sanctions on foreign banks that deal with Russia's war machine, allowing the US Treasury to cut them out of the dollar-led global financial system.That, coupled with recent efforts to rebuild fractured ties with the United States, may make Beijing reluctant to openly push more cooperation with Russia -- despite what Moscow may want, analysts said.Eight people from both countries involved in cross-border trade told AFP in recent days that several Chinese banks have halted or slowed transactions with Russian clients.According to Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin, the banks are ""operating on better-be-safe-than-sorry principles, which reduces the volume of transactions"".""Finding out whether the payments are related to the Russian military-industrial complex... is creating a considerable challenge for Chinese companies and banks,"" he told AFP.Putin's post-election trip to Beijing echoes Xi's own visit to Russia after his re-anointing as leader last year.Experts expect this week's highly symbolic meeting to result in toasts to the ""no limits"" partnership, as well as some deals signed and pledges to increase trade.The two leaders are set to sign a joint declaration following the talks, the Kremlin said, and attend an evening marking 75 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.Putin will also meet Premier Li Qiang -- China's number two official -- and travel to the northeastern city of Harbin for a trade and investment expo.","Russian President Vladimir Putin arrives in China to meet with counterpart Xi Jinping.

Supreme Court orders Louisiana to use congressional map with additional Black district in 2024 vote,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/supreme-court-orders-louisiana-to-use-congressional-map-with-additional-black-district-in-2024-vote/articleshow/110158782.cms,"WASHINGTON: The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered Louisiana to hold congressional elections in 2024 using a House map with a second mostly Black district , despite a lower-court ruling that called the map an illegal racial gerrymander.The order allows the use of a map that has majority Black populations in two of the state's six congressional districts, potentially boosting Democrats' chances of gaining control of the closely divided House of Representatives in the 2024 elections.The justices acted on emergency appeals filed by the state's top Republican elected officials and Black voters who said they needed the high court's intervention to avoid confusion as the elections approach. About a third of Louisiana is Black.The Supreme Court's order does not deal with a lower-court ruling that found the map relied too heavily on race. Instead, it only prevents yet another new map from being drawn for this year's elections.The Supreme Court has previously put court decisions handed down near elections on hold, invoking the need to give enough time to voters and elections officials to ensure orderly balloting. ""When an election is close at hand, the rules of the road must be clear and settled,"" Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote two years ago in a similar case from Alabama. The court has never set a firm deadline for how close is too close.Louisiana has had two congressional maps blocked by federal courts in the past two years in a swirl of lawsuits that included a previous intervention by the Supreme Court.The state's Republican-dominated legislature drew a new congressional map in 2022 to account for population shifts reflected in the 2020 Census. But the changes effectively maintained the status quo of five Republican-leaning majority white districts and one Democratic-leaning majority Black district.Noting the size of the state's Black population, civil rights advocates challenged the map in a Baton Rouge-based federal court and won a ruling from US District Judge Shelly Dick that the districts likely discriminated against Black voters.The Supreme Court put Dick's ruling on hold while it took up a similar case from Alabama. The justices allowed both states to use the maps in the 2022 elections even though both had been ruled likely discriminatory by federal judges.The high court eventually affirmed the ruling from Alabama and returned the Louisiana case to federal court, with the expectation that new maps would be in place for the 2024 elections.The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals gave lawmakers in Louisiana a deadline of early 2024 to draw a new map or face the possibility of a court-imposed map.New Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, had defended Louisiana's congressional map as attorney general. Now, though, he urged lawmakers to pass a new map with another majority Black district at a January special session. He backed a map that created a new majority Black district stretching across the state, linking parts of the Shreveport, Alexandria, Lafayette and Baton Rouge areas.A different set of plaintiffs, a group of self-described non-African Americans, filed suit in western Louisiana, claiming that the new map also was illegal because it was driven too much by race, in violation of the Constitution. A divided panel of federal judges ruled 2-1 in April in their favor and blocked use of the new map.Landry and a Republican ally, state Attorney General Liz Murrill, argue that the new map should be used, saying it was adopted with political considerations - not race - as a driving factor. They note that it provides politically safe districts for House Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise, fellow Republicans. Some lawmakers have also noted that the one Republican whose district is greatly altered in the new map, Rep. Garret Graves, supported a GOP opponent of Landry in last fall's governor's race. The change to Graves' district bolsters the argument that politics was the driving factor rather than race, lawmakers have said.Voting patterns show a new mostly Black district would give Democrats the chance to capture another House seat and send a second Black representative to Congress from Louisiana. Democratic state Sen. Cleo Fields, a former congressman who is Black, had said he will run for Congress in the new district, if it's in place for the next election.",Louisiana has had two congressional maps blocked by federal courts in the past two years in a swirl of lawsuits.

In fact, as numerous social media critics noted, the tune is a lament about despair and misery caused by homelessness, drug addiction and poverty in the celebrated free world. Kyiv-based analyst Oleksandr Kraiev said many Ukrainians were puzzled by his stop at Barman Dictat, which was seen as inappropriate by some, given the current fraught wartime climate.","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken performs Neil Young's ""Rockin' in the Free World"" Critics say the song is a lament about despair and misery caused by homelessness, drug addiction and poverty in the celebrated free world.

However, he remains incarcerated as he is serving sentences in the cipher and iddat cases. Notably, his sentences in two distinct Toshakhana cases were suspended by the IHC.During Tuesday's court session, NAB Special Prosecutor Amjad Pervaiz had indicated that the trial of the former premier and his spouse was nearing completion in his closing remarks.Last December, the National Accountability Bureau launched an inquiry against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Khan, his wife Bushra Bibi, and others, regarding the alleged acquisition of numerous acres of land under the guise of Al Qadir University Trust. This purportedly resulted in a reported loss of 190 million pounds to the national treasury.In a bail petition filed in November of the same year, Khan asserted that the NAB, allegedly acting as a tool of the previous Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government, was politically targeting him through this case, as per Dawn.The Al-Qadir Trust matter revolves around the settlement of 190 million pounds (approximately Rs 50 billion), transferred to Pakistan by the UK's National Crime Agency following its recovery from a Pakistani real estate magnate. During his tenure as prime minister, Khan opted to allow the businessman to utilize the funds to partially settle a fine of around Rs 450 billion, previously imposed by the Supreme Court, instead of depositing it into the national treasury.","Imran Khan was granted bail by Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday in a land corruption case.

And the free world is with you, too,"" Blinken said before playing the song.Blinken watched most of 19.99's set before the lead singer introduced him as a ""great friend of Ukraine."" He then joined them on stage to play the song with the chorus ""keep on rockin' in the free world"".The song was first performed during an era when the Soviet Union was reeling from protests.

What is cold lava? The volcano phenomenon that has caused havoc in Indonesia's Sumatra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/what-is-cold-lava-the-volcano-phenomenon-that-has-caused-havoc-in-indonesias-sumatra/articleshow/110124536.cms,"NEW DELHI: Flash floods , landslides, and a destructive stream of cold lava from Mount Marapi , an active volcano in Sumatra, Indonesia , resulted in the deaths of at least 43 people and left 19 missing over the past weekend. Cold lava, also known as "" lahar "" in Javanese, comprises a mixture of water and rock fragments that flows rapidly down the slopes of a volcano, entering river valleys and spreading across wide areas.The disaster response agency in Indonesia shared distressing images and videos that showed roads and fields near Mount Marapi covered in thick mud and ash. This cold lava can flow at speeds of hundreds of kilometers per hour and reach distances as far as 60 km from the volcano, posing a significant threat to anything in its path, a report in the Independent said.According to the United States Geological Survey, lahars are considered more destructive and deadlier than regular lava flows. They have the potential to crush or bury almost anything, and by destroying infrastructure such as bridges and roads, they can trap people in areas that are vulnerable to further volcanic activities.Brittany Brand, director of the Boise State Hazard and Climate Resilience Institute at Boise State University , explained that even a small eruption of ash or lava could melt enough snowcap to produce devastating lahars. ""A small eruption of ash or lava can melt enough of that snowcap to produce devastating lahars,"" she said in an interview with Newsweek.The region frequently experiences landslides and flash floods, exacerbated by its geographical location on the Pacific Ring of Fire , home to 127 active volcanoes, more than any other country in the world. Mount Marapi alone has erupted 11 times in the 21st century, with a significant eruption in December spewing ash up to 3,000 meters into the air and covering towns and villages in ash.The situation remains precarious as Indonesian authorities continue to warn residents and climbers to avoid areas within a 4.5 km radius of Mount Marapi's crater. This recent activity underscores the ongoing volcanic threat faced by millions living in mountainous or flood-prone areas across Indonesia’s vast archipelago of over 17,000 islands.","Cold lava, also known as "" lahar "" flows rapidly down the slopes of a volcano, entering river valleys and spreading across wide areas.

NEW DELHI: Eleven people were killed in a series of mass shootings on Tuesday in a small town in the southern Mexico 's Chiapas state, officials said.The shooting took place in Chicomuselo township in Mexico, known as a trafficking route for migrants and drug smuggling activities that has been hit by cartel turf wars in recent months.The killings occurred in Morelia, a remote hamlet within the township of Chicomuselo, situated near the border between Mexico and Guatemala.There have been confrontations between drug cartels in the area as recently as Monday, but at least some of the victims of Tuesday's shootings appeared to be simply residents of the town.As of Monday, clashes between drug cartels have been ongoing in the area. However, some of the victims of Tuesday's shootings seemed to be ordinary residents of the town, unrelated to any criminal activity.The ongoing turf war between the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels has led to widespread violence and displacement in the Chiapas border region.These criminal organisations are vying for control over various illicit activities, including the smuggling of migrants, drugs, and weapons, as well as the forcible recruitment of local individuals into their ranks.","Eleven people were killed in a series of mass shootings on Tuesday in a small town in the southern Mexico's Chiapas state.

A completestrike has also been observed in the territory since Friday, bringing life to a halt.Shortly before the violence, Prime Minister Sharif and the disputed region's 'prime minister' Anwarul Haq after a meeting had approved the release of Pakistani Rs 23 billion for the region on account of power and wheat subsidies.The subsidised rate for 40kg flour will be Pakistani Rs 2,000, down from Pakistani Rs 3,100.

Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif approved Monday around $82.6 million (Pak Rs 2,300cr) for Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) in a bid to halt violent protests and strikes against escalating electricity tariffs , flour prices and taxes. The protests have left a police officer dead and 90 others, mostly cops, injured in the last few days.The growing unrest poses a grave challenge to Pakistan’s military, which maintains a significant presence in the region to guard the Line of Control with India.On Monday, protesters led by Awami Action Committee (AAC), an activist group that has united people to demand lower rates for essentials, continued a march to regional capital Muzaffarabad after negotiations with the govt ended in deadlock.The stalemate prompted PM Sharif, already under pressure over postponement of Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman’s crucial visit to Pakistan later this month, to clear the grant for PoK at a special meeting in Islamabad. The meeting was attended by PoK’s PM Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, local ministers and other top figures. Following the meeting, PoK PM Haq announced cuts in bread prices and electricity tariffs.Meanwhile, mobile and internet services suspended in PoK a day earlier have not been restored in most parts. Govt offices, markets, trade centres and educational institutes also remained shut.Although there have been no calls for independence in the current wave of turmoil, locals said the protests reflected a general feeling of discontent with Islamabad. In the past, Islamabad had come under fire for suppressing regional movements that demanded total independence.The recent crisis began Friday when AAC started a Muzaffarabad strike that soon snowballed into violent clashes with law-enforcement officials. The detention of over 70 activists fuelled the unrest.

LONDON: In a week, WikiLeaks ' founder Julian Assange could be on a flight to the United States at the end of his years-long legal battle to avoid extradition . Whatever happens, his wife Stella vows the fight for his freedom will go on.At a hearing at London's High Court on Monday which Assange plans to attend, judges are expected to give a ruling on whether to accept U.S.assurances which would pave the way for him to be sent across the Atlantic to face 18 charges, nearly all under the Espionage Act .""It's impossible to really prepare for this moment. What I do feel is that anything could happen, that Julian could be very close to being free, or he could be very close to being put on a plane and never seeing freedom ever again,"" Stella Assange told Reuters in an interview.The High Court's decision could bring down the curtain on the Australian-born Assange's legal battles in Britain that have been going on for more than 13 years since WikiLeaks burst onto the world stage with details from what was the biggest security breach of its kind in U.S. military history.If the judges agree to the extradition, only an intervention from Europe could block it.""Unless the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) puts a stop to it, and they're able to act in time, and we're able to file in time - all these 'ifs' - then Julian could be on a military jet to the United States, a week from now,"" said Stella, who added she had ""a lot of faith"" in the ECHR.As the clock ticks down to Monday's hearing, she said her husband was very stressed and had trouble sleeping, and it was a very difficult time for her and their family.""My heart is preparing for the win. But I have to keep my head focused on the fact that he's very close to being extradited,"" she said.She said she had not told the couple's two children, now aged 7 and 5, about the extradition, saying she would not want to ""inflict the uncertainty and the prospect of them losing their father forever"".""All they know is that he shouldn't be in prison and that we're fighting to get him out,"" said Stella, a lawyer who met her husband when she joined his legal team more than a decade ago.Assange has spent the last five years in Belmarsh maximum security jail, a bleak modern prison in a remote area of southeast London, where the couple married in a 2022 ceremony attended by just four guests - two of whom were guards.For the seven years before that, he was holed up in cramped conditions in the Ecuadorean Embassy in central London where he fled to avoid extradition to Sweden over sex offence allegations which were later dropped.He had always argued that if extradited to Sweden he would then be sent to the United States over WikiLeaks' release of hundreds of thousands of secret documents and diplomatic cables.After being dragged out of the embassy in 2019 and jailed for skipping bail, the U.S. began extradition proceedings.The U.S. authorities say his actions were reckless, damaged, national security, and endangered the lives of agents.His many supporters say the prosecution is a travesty, an assault on journalism and free speech, and revenge for causing embarrassment to Western governments.Stella would not be drawn on U.S. reports that a plea bargain deal was possible, simply saying the U.S. should drop the prosecution. Should he lose on Monday, her fight, as it has for the last decade, will continue.""I'll do whatever I can, and our family is going to fight for him until he's free.""","WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange could be on a flight to the United States in a week.
