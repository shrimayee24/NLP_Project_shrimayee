NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Friday accused India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of committing a ""historic sin"" by truncating certain parts of Vande Matram which hailed Goddess Durga.In a social media post on X, BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan said that Congress, under Nehru's presidentship, adopted only a truncated Vande Mataram as the party’s national song in its 1937 Faizpur session. He also cited Nehru's letter to Subhash Chandra Bose where Nehru said that Vande Matram has nothing to do with Goddess Durga and opines that Vande Mataram is not suitable as a national song.""It is imperative for our younger generation to know how the Congress party brazenly pandering to its communal agenda under the Presidentship of Nehru, adopted only a truncated Vande Mataram as the party’s national song in its 1937 Faizpur Session, while PM Narendra Modi today will inaugurate the 150th year commemoration & participate in the mass recital of the full version of our glorious Vande Mataram across the nation,"" Kesavan said.""The glorious Vande Mataram became the voice of our nation’s unity and solidarity, celebrating our motherland, instilling nationalistic spirit and fostering patriotism. Chanting it was made a criminal offense by the British. It did not belong to any particular religion or language. But the Congress committed the historic sin and blunder of linking the song with religion. Congress under Nehru citing religious grounds deliberately removed stanzas of Vande Mataram which hailed Goddess Ma Durga,"" he added.The BJP leader also attacked leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, claiming that ""Hindu Virodhi mentality"" of Nehru finds a pungent echo in Congress leader's recent remarks on Chatth Puja.""In a letter dated Sep 1, 1937, Nehru spitefully writes that anybody considering the words in Vande Mataram as anything to do with a Goddess was absurd. He also derisively opines that Vande Mataram is not suitable as a national song. Netaji Subash Bose had strongly advocated for the full original version of Vande Mataram. On Oct 20, 1937 Nehru wrote to Netaji Bose claiming that the background of Vande Mataram was likely to irritate Muslims. He went on to say that there does seem to be substance regarding outcry against Vande Mataram and people who are communalistically inclined have been affected by it,"" he said.""In 1937 if Nehru as Congress president blanked out the mention of Goddess Ma Durga by truncating Vande Mataram, Rahul Gandhi in March 2024 maliciously remarked ‘ There is a word called Shakti in Hindu Dharma and we are fighting against Shakti’. The Hindu Virodhi mentality of Nehru finds a pungent echo in Rahul Gandhi who recently demeaned and maligned the sacred Chatth Puja as a drama, hurting the sentiments of crores of devotees,"" he added.This comes as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to launch year long celebrations to commemorate 150 years of national song at Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium on Friday. He will also release a commemorative stamp and coin during the event.The programme will mark the formal launch of the year-long nationwide commemoration of the composition that inspired India's freedom movement and continues to evoke national pride and unity.Composed by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, 'Vande Mataram' was first published in the literary journal 'Bangadarshan' on November 7, 1875.""Later, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee incorporated the hymn in his immortal novel 'Anandamath' which was published in 1882. It was set to music by Rabindranath Tagore. It has become an integral part of the nation's civilisational, political and cultural consciousness,"" a government statement said.","Bharatiya Janata Party accused India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of committing a ""historic sin"" by truncating certain parts of Vande Matram.

PM Modi Calls Vande Mataram A ‘Mantra Of Unity And Courage’ As The Song Completes 150 Years

Tagore himself wanted it, hits back Congress, demands apology





‘Anthem of Independence’, mantra for Tagore, Gandhi, Savarkar: PM





NEW DELHI: PM Modi alleged Friday that in 1937 ""significant verses"" of ' Vande Mataram ' were dropped, ""sowing the seeds of the country's Partition"", in what was seen as an attack on Congress in the midst of the Bihar elections and months before Bengal goes to the polls.Launching year-long celebrations to mark 150 years of the national song, where he recited all six stanzas, PM Modi warned that the ""same divisive mindset"" remained a challenge to the nation. ""The spirit of 'Vande Mataram' illuminated the entire nation during the freedom struggle. But unfortunately, in 1937, crucial verses of 'Vande Mataram', a part of its soul, were severed. 'Vande Mataram' was broken, torn into pieces,"" the PM said without naming anyone.""Why was this great mantra of nation-building treated with such injustice? This is crucial for today's generation to understand, because that same divisive thinking remains a challenge for the country even today,"" PM Modi said.Citing a letter from Rabindranath Tagore to Jawaharlal Nehru, Congress spokesman Jairam Ramesh claimed ""Gurudev"" had himself sought adoption of two stanzas of 'Vande Mataram' as the national song, and said PM Modi should apologise to the nation for calling the act a ""divisive ideology"".""It is a shameful statement from a man whose lies and distortions have no limits,"" he said.Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said his party was the ""proud flagbearer"" of the song, which became the rallying cry for the freedom struggle. He alleged RSS never accepted the song and has stuck to its ""Namaste Sada Vatsale"". He added, ""Sangh Parivar supported the British against Indians, abused the Constitution, burned effigies of Bapu and Babasaheb Ambedkar.""Ramesh said Sabyasachi Bhattacharya's biography of 'Vande Mataram' gives the background to the CWC resolution of Oct 29, 1937, which adopted the song.PM Modi said the ""anthem of Independence"" was the mantra for Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi, Savarkar and Aurobindo, and the national flag designed by Bhikaji Cama had 'Vande Mataram' written on it.""In 1896, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore sang 'Vande Mataram' at the (Congress) Calcutta session. The partition of Bengal took place in 1905. This was a dangerous experiment by the British to divide the country. However, 'Vande Mataram' stood as a rock against those plans. There was only one voice on the streets protesting against the partition of Bengal: 'Vande Mataram',"" PM Modi saidReflecting on the relevance of the national song as a guiding force even today and the message it holds, the PM said, ""When the enemy dared to attack India's security and honour through terrorism, the entire world saw that India also knows how to become Durga to destroy terror"". The comments were seen as a reference to Operation Sindoor.Noting that Nov 7 also marked 11 years since the implementation of 'one rank one pension' for defence personnel, PM Modi said, ""When our armed forces crush the nefarious designs of the enemy, when terrorism, Naxalism, and Maoist insurgency are decisively defeated, our security forces are inspired by a single mantra - 'Vande Mataram'.""""For those who consider the nation as a geopolitical entity, the idea of considering the nation as a mother may be surprising. However, India is different. In India, a mother is both a mother and a nurturer. If a child faces a crisis, she is also a destroyer,"" PM said and pointed out how 'Vande Mataram' highlighted the immense power of 'Bharat Ma'.PM Modi said during the colonial era, the British sought to justify their rule by portraying India as inferior and backward. He emphasised that the very first line of 'Vande Mataram' powerfully dismantled this propaganda.Therefore, 'Vande Mataram' was not merely a song of freedom - it also presented to millions of Indians a vision of what a free India could be: the dream of a 'Sujalam Sufalam Bharat', he said.","PM Modi alleges that in 1937 ""significant verses"" of'Vande Mataram'were dropped, ""sowing the seeds of the country's Partition"" Congress spokesman Jairam Ramesh claimed ""Gurudev"" had himself sought adoption of two stanzas of 'Vande Mataram' as the national song.

Probe suggests SI Kumar died of head injury, say police



HISAR: A police officer was beaten to death allegedly by hooligans outside his home in Haryana's Hisar late Thursday. Sub-inspector Ramesh Kumar, 57, tried to stop the assailants from creating a ruckus in the neighbourhood but was allegedly battered with bricks and sticks. The officer's nephew was also injured in the attack. Police have arrested five suspects.Kumar was posted in the office of ADGP, Hisar range, and lived with his family. Around 11 pm, a group of men parked themselves on the street outside his home and began drinking and using abusive language.The sub-inspector asked the hooligans not to create a nuisance in a residential area. The group dispersed but returned 20 minutes later with a few more men and began creating a ruckus again. When SI Ramesh Kumar stepped out to confront the men, they set upon him and allegedly bludgeoned him with bricks and construction debris. The SI's nephew Amit Kumar rushed out to protect him but he too was attacked by the hooligans.When some neighbours stepped out after hearing their screams, the attackers fled, leaving behind a car and a couple of two-wheelers on which they had arrived. Both victims were rushed to Hisar general hospital, where doctors declared Ramesh dead on arrival.Amit is under treatment. Word quickly spread that a cop had been murdered. Additional director general of police KK Rao and SP Shashank Kumar Sawan rushed to the spot and inspected the scene.Multiple teams were sent after the accused.

BUDGAM: J&K CM Omar Abdullah Friday attacked the PDP , accusing it of betraying people’s trust in 2014 by joining hands with the BJP after the assembly polls to form the govt in the state.He was addressing a gathering in Budgam, the assembly constituency going to vote in the bypoll on November 11. Omar had vacated the seat he won in last year’s assembly polls in the state along with his traditional seat of Ganderbal.“This seat will have no impact on the NC government, but we cannot overlook its significance. This election can send out several important messages,” he said.“A year ago, my colleagues and I asked you to vote for me so that we could keep the BJP out of power and form our own government. The people accepted that appeal and gave us their mandate, and we have remained steadfast in our principles, staying away from the BJP,” he said.“Earlier, another party also sought votes on the same slogan,” Omar said. “In 2014 our rival PDP asked people to vote for them to keep the BJP out. And from Qazigund to Kupwara, people did so. But they betrayed that trust. The very next day, PDP joined hands with BJP and formed the govt.”The CM blamed the PDP-BJP alliance of 2014-2015 for the political changes that followed in J&K, including the abrogation of Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019, and downgrading of J&K from a state to a union territory.“What happened in 2019 and after was because of that alliance,” Omar said.The CM said that had the NC, like PDP, formed a governmentt with BJP after last year’s elections, Jammu and Kashmir could have become a state. “But I was not ready to deceive my mandate,” he said.Despite being a UT CM, Omar said, his govt has carried out developmental works in the region. “I vacated the Budgam seat because the law does not allow holding two constituencies. But I have continued to work for Budgam,” he said, announcing that Budgam would be developed as a model assembly constituency and that a university would be established here.There are three main contestants in Budgam — NC’s Aga Syed Mehmood, PDP’s Aga Syed Muntazir Mehdi, and BJP’s Aga Syed Mohsin. With NC MP Aga Ruhullah, a former MLA from Budgam, staying away from the party’s campaign and accusing the leadership of abandoning the struggle for the restoration of Article 370, the NC is pushing hard to win the seat to send a message to both the PDP and its own dissenting MP that it remains popular among the people.","J&K CM Omar Abdullah accuses PDP of betraying people's trust in 2014.

'RJD Put Katta To Congress' Head': PM Modi Slams Mahagathbandhan In Bihar Rally

Donald Trump Calls PM Modi A 'Great Friend', Says India Visit 'Could Be' Next Year Amid Talks

Trade talks with India have progressed, says Trump





NEW YORK/WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump has said he may travel to India next year, adding that PM Modi ""wants"" him to visit.""He's a friend of mine, and we speak... He wants me to go there. We will figure that out. I will go. I will have a great trip there with Prime Minister Modi, he's a great man. And I'll be going,"" Trump said Thursday in response to a question. Asked if the visit could happen next year, Trump said, ""It could be, yeah.""India is due to host the next Quad summit with leaders from Australia, Japan, and US, after the 2024 meeting in Delaware. However, dates are yet to be announced. MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal in New Delhi declined to comment on the visit. ""I will let you know when I have (information),"" Jaiswal said.On trade, Donald Trump claimed progress in talks with India and repeated his assertion that India had reduced oil imports from Russia. ""It's great, going good. He (PM Modi) stopped... Largely, he stopped buying oil from Russia,"" he said.Trump had imposed 25% reciprocal tariffs on India and an additional 25% levy on purchases of Russian oil, taking total levy to 50%.India had called the measures ""unfair, unjustified and unreasonable"".Trump also revisited an oft-repeated claim: that he stopped a war between India and Pakistan using tariffs. ""Of the eight wars I ended, five or six were ended because of tariffs,"" he said. ""If you take a look at India and Pakistan, they started to fight - they are two nuclear nations... And I said, 'Listen, if you guys are going to fight, I'm gonna put tariffs on you.' Within 24 hours, I settled the war. If I didn't have tariffs, I wouldn't have been able to settle that war. "" Trump called tariffs a ""great national defence.""On May 10, he announced on social media that India and Pakistan had agreed to a ""full and immediate ceasefire"" after a ""long night"" of talks mediated by Washington. He has since repeated that claim more than 60 times.","US President Donald Trump has said he may travel to India next year, adding that PM Modi ""wants"" him to visit.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's duplicity on terrorism was laid bare once again after a minister in prime minister Shehbaz Sharif's government paid a visit to the political wing of Hafiz Saeed ’s banned Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD), the outfit responsible for the 26/11 Mumbai attacks.Talal Chaudhry, minister of state for interior and a close aide of Shehbaz Sharif, visited the Faisalabad office of the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League (PMML), widely recognised as the political front of Hafiz Saeed's JuD, and held meetings with its leaders on Thursday, news agency PTI reported. The visit, described locally as an attempt to ""build political consensus,"" has sparked outrage for what appears to be official patronage of a proscribed terror-linked organisation.Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, is currently serving time in Lahore jail after multiple convictions in terror-financing cases.In a statement released after the visit, the PMML said Chaudhry and party leaders discussed ""national unity"" and ""political stability,"" underscoring the importance of ""continuity of democratic processes."" The meeting, held under the guise of promoting harmony, effectively showcased how Pakistan’s political establishment continues to normalise banned extremist outfits.This marks the first visit by a federal minister to the PMML office in recent years, further blurring the line between Pakistan's political class and its radical organisations. Earlier, Punjab assembly speaker Malik Ahmad Khan had attended a PMML rally in Kasur, where he openly praised Saeed, another indication of how terror-linked figures are courted by the ruling elite.Observers say the timing is significant. The PMML’s resurgence has coincided with renewed tensions with India, especially after the Pahalgam terror attack, with the group reportedly operating freely ""under government umbrella.""","Talal Chaudhry, minister of state for interior, visited the office of the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League (PMML) The PMML is the political wing of the banned Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD), responsible for the 26/11 Mumbai attacks.

‘CITY THAT DEVOURS MAYORS’: Zohran Mamdani Faces BRUTAL Reality Of Running NYC | EXPLAINED





WASHINGTON: From the MAGA perspective, millionaires are fleeing Manhattan, cops are quitting NYPD en masse, and the Big Apple is rotting faster than strawberries on a summer day because New York City has fallen…to Communists, Islamists and immigrants. Memes show the Statue of Liberty under a burka or niqab, hammer and sickle projected on the Empire State Building, and public transport overcrowded with immigrants in native grab among other bleak outcomes of Zohran Mamdani victory in the mayoral election. “Imagine North Korea… with a dash of Sharia,” goes one rightwing parody of Frank Sinatra’s song New York, New York.Liberals and progressives meanwhile are cockahoop with delight at the resurgence of the left, reflected in a raft of jokes, some of them self-deprecating, on late-night shows. ""Today Democrats are walking around with a spring in their step like a divorced mom in her 40s whose new haircut just got her carded at two different bars,” riffed Seth Meyers, whose late-night gig on NBC beams from the Rockefeller Center in NYC. Trump’s bete-nore Jimmy Kimmel, whose late-night show on ABC broadcasts from across the country in Hollywood, Los Angeles, joked that President’s social media post after the rout (“...ANDSO IT BEGINS!) “was either a response to Mamdani winning the mayoral race, or he just sat down on the toilet.”Toilet humor aside, the more serious commentariat agreed on one thing: Mamdani’s rise from an obscure local legislator who polled less than 1 percent when he began his campaign to a monumental victory with over 50 percent vote has electrified American politics. Although he is not eligible to run for the White House (he is not born in the U.S., a Constitutional requirement to run for President), many are already seeing him, or at least his policy prescriptions, as a challenge, and perhaps even an opportunity, for MAGA supreme Donald Trump to define him in fearful terms.“His smile is disarming, but his ideas are armed to the teeth,” the Wall Street Journal said of Mamdani’s policies, suggesting that his victory could inspire more leftist candidates to challenge moderate Democrats, allowing President Trump to drive home his message of radical left lunatics taking over America. Trump himself is said to have acknowledged that Mamdani is a “talented politician” and “slick talker,” according to one report.So despite railing against the “communist lunatic,” Trump is now showing signs of learning something from the electoral setback. Pilloried for his tone-deaf bragging about his new White House ballroom and his hosting a Gatsby-themed party at his Mar-o-Lago estate at a time of government shutdown, the President briefly embraced the term “affordability” – which Mamdani flogged during his campaign – while discussing a deal to reduce the price of certain drugs like anti-obesity medications at a White House event on Thursday. Taunted from the left that “Affordability is Trump's word of the week,” the President shrank from the word later, saying “I don’t want to hear about affordability” and insisting that inflation is under control and prices are coming down under him. “My cost are lower than the Democrats on everything, especially oil and gas! So the Democrats “affordability” issue is DEAD! STOP LYING!!!” he posted on Truth Social.But even hard-core MAGA lawmakers previously seen as rabid race-baiters are starting to put affordability issues ahead of immigrant demonisation that has been their go-to issue. “Grocery prices remain high. Energy prices are high. My electricity bills are higher…So, affordability is a problem,” Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has sounded increasingly critical of Trump, in recent weeks, said in a TV interview on Thursday, adding that she is worried about her children’s generation because “they’re having a very hard time. ”Even millionaires and billionaires, said to be decamping NYC in the face of the ""socialist surge"" seemed to acknowledge Mamdani has raised important issues. ""Congrats on the win. Now you have a big responsibility. If I can help NYC, just let me know what I can do,"" Bill Ackman, billionaire hedge fund manager and NewYorker who contributed $ 1 million to Mamdani's opponent Andrew Cuomo, posted soon after Mamdani's win.",Zohran Mamdani won the NYC mayoral election with over 50 percent of the vote. His victory is being seen as an opportunity for MAGA supreme Donald Trump to define him in fearful terms. Trump is now showing signs of learning something from the electoral setback.

Pakistan Fires Into Afghanistan, Breaks Ceasefire Amid Turkey Peace Talks: Taliban Confirms





Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif on Friday said the dialogue between Pakistan and Afghanistan has effectively collapsed, noting that the process has “entered an indefinite phase” after negotiators failed to narrow key differences, reported Dawn News.Officials and security sources earlier confirmed there was no breakthrough.“The talks in Istanbul are deadlocked,” a senior security source told the Pakistani daily, indicating the discussions had reached an impasse.Asif said the government had concluded that ""the talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan are over,"" signalling the end of the latest round of diplomatic engagement aimed at easing cross-border tensions.The collapse in talks follows weeks of fighting along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border that has resulted in civilian and military casualties on both sides, marking the deadliest escalation in years.The violence began after an October 9 explosion in Kabul and another in Paktika the same day which Afghan government blamed on Pakistan. Pakistani officials have neither confirmed nor denied involvement in the blasts, and neither side issued details on casualties from the initial incidents.Since October 9, repeated shelling and exchanges of fire have killed dozens, though casualty figures differ widely. Earlier this week, Pakistan's military spokesman Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif said more than 200 Afghan soldiers and more than 100 militants were killed when Pakistani forces targeted militant hideouts and army positions in Afghanistan after coming under attack.Afghan government spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid rejected that assessment, saying only nine Afghan soldiers had been killed and 22 wounded, while claiming that up to 45 civilians had been killed and 102 wounded in the strikes. Mujahid also claimed 58 Pakistani soldiers had been killed, a figure Pakistan disputed, stating that 23 of its soldiers had died in the fighting.The worsening violence prompted Qatar to mediate, bringing the two sides to Doha for talks that led to a ceasefire on October19.Two additional rounds were later held in Istanbul. While both sides say the ceasefire technically remains in place, sporadic attacks have continued.An Afghan official told news agency AP on Friday that overnight clashes in the border region killed four Afghan civilians and wounded five others.The two countries share a 2,611-kilometre border known as the Durand Line. Established in 1893, the line cuts through the traditional homeland of the Pashtun people, Afghanistan’s largest ethnic group and the core base of the Afghan Taliban.Although the frontier is internationally recognised as Pakistan’s border, Afghanistan has long refused to accept it.",Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif said the dialogue between Pakistan and Afghanistan has effectively collapsed. Asif noted that the process has “entered an indefinite phase’ after negotiators failed to narrow key differences.

'Don't lecture about Indian literacy rates': American CEO James Fishback's jibe at Vivek Ramaswamy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dont-lecture-about-indian-literacy-rates-american-ceo-james-fishbacks-jibe-at-vivek-ramaswamy/articleshow/125161003.cms,"CEO James Fishback took a veiled dig at Vivek Ramaswamy as he mentioned India, maths olympiad in his recent America First speech.





Azoria CEO and ex-DOGE architect James Fishback took a dig at GOP leader Vivek Ramaswamy without naming him and said Americans should not be apologetic about who they are and nobody should lecture Americans on India's literacy or Chinese maths. Americans won't change their culture for a maths olympiad or for a Chemistry exam, Fishback said as he was giving a speech at Boston University College Republicans. The ex-DOGE architect has emerged as a strong anti-H-1B voice.""We don't want ANYONE lecturing us about Indian literacy rates or Chinese math rates. Cut the crap now. We’re Americans. We’re talented. We’re smart. And no, we’re not giving up church on Sunday for more math tutoring. We’re not skipping Friday Night Lights because there’s a chemistry test to cram for. The second we stop apologizing for who we are, we will start winning again!"" Fishback said.The America First CEO has been pushing for completely stopping the H-1B visa program and said that a foreigner should only come to the US for tourism.Fishback's reference to math tutoring, chemistry test was a jibe at Indian-origin Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy who last year created a major uproar in the H-1B controversy as he attacked American culture to justify the H-1B program.Ramaswamy said American culture worships mediocrity over excellence, celebrates prom queen over math olympiad and hence tech companies need to hire foreign employees as there is a dearth of Americans in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.While Vivek's critique of American culture turned out to be a watershed moment for MAGA, with Vivek becoming sidelined, the H-1B conundrum still persists. The Donald Trump administration has imposed a $100,000 fee on hiring H-1Bs, making it difficult for tech companies to hire from foreign countries. Florida has recently announced a ban on H-1Bs in Florida colleges and universities as Governor Ron DeSantis revealed that instead of special positions, the colleges and universities made foreign hiring for some very basic posts, like a public policy professor from China, a graphic designer from Canada.","Azoria CEO and ex-DOGE architect James Fishback took a dig at GOP leader Vivek Ramaswamy without naming him.

University of Pennsylvania cyber attack: Data worth million exposed





The University of Pennsylvania has confirmed that hackers gained access to several of its internal systems linked to development and alumni activities, stealing confidential data in the process, reports BleepingComputer. The breach, discovered on October 31, occurred after attackers obtained employee credentials through a social engineering scam.""Penn employs a robust information security program; however, access to these systems occurred due to a sophisticated identity impersonation commonly known as social engineering,"" the university said in a statement.The university said its staff quickly locked down the affected systems to stop further intrusions but not before an “offensive and fraudulent email” was sent to members of the Penn community.The university further revealed that it has alerted the FBI and is working with cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike to investigate the incident.According to BleepingComputer’s report, the attackers accessed Penn’s Salesforce donor database, SharePoint files, and other platforms, stealing around 1.71 GB of data. This includes sensitive personal and financial information of alumni and donors such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email IDs, and donation histories.The hackers claimed to have obtained records of roughly 1.2 million donors, including details like “gift histories, wealth ratings, and lifetime commitment amounts.” They also said they sent a mass email to nearly 700,000 people after discovering their access was revoked.The attackers told BleepingComputer that the breach wasn’t politically motivated but aimed at Penn’s “vast, wonderfully wealthy donor database.” However, their communications also included sharp criticism of the university’s diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.The university says it is now strengthening its security systems, conducting staff training on social engineering, and enhancing monitoring tools.Once the probe concludes, Penn plans to notify affected individuals. The university has also urged students, alumni, and donors to stay alert for suspicious emails or phone calls that could be phishing attempts.","University of Pennsylvania has confirmed that hackers gained access to several of its internal systems linked to development and alumni activities.

RAIPUR: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday conducted simultaneous searches at 12 locations across Chhattisgarh’s Maoist-affected Dantewada and Sukma districts in Bastar in connection with the 2023 Aranpur IED blast and ambush case, allegedly orchestrated by cadres of the banned CPI (Maoist) outfit.According to an official statement, the raids were carried out at the premises of several suspects and accused in case number RC-07/2024/NIA/RPR. The attack, executed by the Darbha Division Committee of the CPI (Maoist) near village Pedka under Aranpur police station limits in Dantewada on April 26, 2023, had claimed 11 lives, including that of a civilian driver, and was among the deadliest incidents reported from Bastar that year.During the searches, the agency seized several incriminating materials, including cash, handwritten letters, and printed receipt books linked to Maoist “levy” collections, along with digital devices belonging to the suspects. Preliminary scrutiny indicated that these individuals had direct connections with Maoist cadres involved in carrying out the deadly attack.The NIA said it continues to investigate the wider network behind the ambush.So far, two charge sheets have been filed against 27 arrested persons, and further investigations are underway to trace remaining operatives and financiers connected to the incident.The April 2023 ambush, which targeted security personnel in the Aranpur region, drew national attention for its scale and precision, highlighting the continued Maoist presence in parts of south Bastar despite intensified security operations.","The National Investigation Agency conducted simultaneous searches at 12 locations across Chhattisgarh’s Maoist-affected Dantewada and Sukma districts in Bastar.

Hidma: The Warlord in Hiding





RAIPUR: The outlawed CPI (Maoist) is facing one of its gravest internal breakdowns in decades- a leadership vacuum so deep that even its most feared commander, Madvi Hidma, is said to be living in fear, cut off from his otherwise close group and constantly changing hideouts to evade capture.According to sources in intelligence network, a crucial central committee of Maoists held a meeting recently deep inside Telangana’s Nallamala Hills to appoint a new general secretary that ended inconclusively, exposing how fractured the outfit’s chain of command has become under relentless pressure from security forces across Chhattisgarh, Telangana, and Odisha.The meeting was attended by senior leaders Madvi Hidma, Damodar, and Devji, but several key members failed to reach the venue due to continuous search operations and aerial monitoring. “Without quorum or connectivity, no decision could be taken. The Maoists are functioning headless,” said an officer.“Basavaraju’s death has left a vacuum that no one is capable or confident enough to fill.”The general secretary's post of Maoists has remained vacant since the killing of their top gun Nambala Keshav Rao alias Basavaraju, in Abujhmarh forests in May, 2025.His death marked a major setback for the Maoist hierarchy.The Bastar region, once considered an impenetrable Maoist bastion, has been witnessing unprecedented counter-insurgency pressure under Operation Prahar and Operation Monsoon. The multi-state operations coordinated by Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Maharashtra, and Odisha police have struck at the group’s logistical and communication lines.“The command structure has shattered. Force pressure has reached their innermost hideouts,” said a senior police officer posted in Bastar. “They can no longer convene meetings or plan offensives. The fear of surveillance has confined their leadership to constant movement.”He said that the officials said the leadership crisis has also disrupted arms supply, medical channels, and local recruitments, leaving smaller units isolated and demoralized.At the heart of this turmoil is Madvi Hidma, commander of the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) Battalion number 1 and once the most feared name in Bastar’s dense forests.Known as the mastermind of the Tadmetla (2010) and Burkapal (2017) ambushes that killed dozens of security personnel, Hidma is now reportedly consumed by fear and paranoia.Intelligence inputs suggest he has been frequently changing hideouts between the valleys of Abujhmarh, the Telangana–Chhattisgarh border, and the Nallamala forests, avoiding prolonged contact even with his long-time associates.“Hidma is terrified of betrayal. He suspects his own guards and refuses to stay in one place for more than a few nights. He no longer holds control over his units; only fear of arrest or ambush governs his movements,” he said.Security sources revealed that a recent joint combing operation along the borders of Chhattisgarh-Telangana came within minutes of locating Hidma’s base — a near miss that reportedly triggered his current state of panic.Speaking to TOI, Bastar range inspector general of police P Sundarraj said, ""There are clear signs of an ongoing leadership crisis within the CPI (Maoist) organization. Reliable inputs indicate growing mistrust and internal rifts among the senior leadership and the lower ranks. Senior cadres such as Devji, Hidma, and Barse Deva are reportedly facing increasing resistance and dissatisfaction from the younger members of the outfit. On the other hand the senior cadres are also distancing themselves from the junior cadres for the fear of repercussions,""This widening divide between the top leadership and ground-level cadres has severely affected the cohesion and morale of the Maoist outfit, he added. ""The steady decline in their unity and cohesion is a reflection of the continuous and effective pressure being maintained by the security forces and the growing realization among cadres about the futility of the violent path,"" Sundarraj said.The Maoist chain of command, once rigid and secretive, has crumbled under the twin impact of military pressure and internal distrust.The inability to elect a new General Secretary since Basavaraju’s death has left regional commands acting independently, without ideological direction or operational coordination.Field reports from Sukma and Bijapur indicate a steady decline in cadre strength, with over 500 surrenders recorded this year and many mid-level commanders reportedly seeking negotiation through local intermediaries.Security analysts say the CPI (Maoist), which once claimed to be India’s most organized insurgent group, is now reduced to a fragmented collection of survival cells. “They are no longer leading a revolution, they’re merely running to stay alive.”In the deep forests of Bastar, where the sound of gunfire once defined life and death, a strange silence now hangs in the air.For the first time in decades, security forces are moving deeper than ever before, roads are being laid where landmines once exploded, and the Maoists’ own leaders are running out of both ground and time.","The outlawed CPI (Maoist) is facing one of its gravest internal breakdowns in decades- a leadership vacuum so deep that even its most feared commander, Madvi Hidma, is said to be living in fear.

LUCKNOW: The decisionof a serving havildar in the Indian Army to donate his mother’s organs, after her death due to snake bite, helped in saving three invaluable lives, including an Army jawan and a veteran.The armyman's mother, 59, was working in the farm field in Jaunpur when she was bitten by a snake on Oct 28. After initial treatment with an anti-venom dose at a local hospital in Jaunpur, she was admitted to Command Hospital (CH) in Lucknow on Oct 30.Despite being kept on the ventilator for nearly a week, her condition deteriorated. Doctors declared her brain dead at 7.40pm on Thursday. Following the armyman’s consent, the organ retrieval process was initiated immediately.Doctors said that the nature of snake bite was neurotoxic in which organ donation could be safely conducted.The entire operation, from declaration of brain death to organ retrieval and transportation, lasted over eight hours which involved coordinated efforts from medical teams at Command Hospital, Lucknow, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) Lucknow, and Army Hospital Research and Referral (AHRR), Delhi.The Indian Air Force (IAF) provided crucial logistical support, flying the AHRR medical team to Lucknow and transporting the retrieved liver to Delhi in a Dornier 228 aircraft. Lucknow police facilitated the organ transfer by creating a green corridor between CH and Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport (CCSIA).Her kidneys were transplanted to two patients — an Army jawan at CH (Lucknow) and a 31-year-old male patient at SGPGIMS. Her liver was flown to AHRR, Delhi, to save a veteran.Major General Alok Bhalla, Commandant of CH, Lucknow, who led the operation, said that the neurotoxic venom had paralyzed the victim’s respiratory muscles, leading to respiratory failure, asphyxiation, and ultimately brain hypoxia. “Once the son gave consent, agencies including the Armed Forces Organ Retrieval & Transplantation Authority (AORTA) and State Organ & Tissue Transplant Organization, Uttar Pradesh (SOTTO UP) were activated, and a detailed organ retrieval roadmap was created,” he said.Specialist teams were formed for the procedure. From CH Lucknow, Col Sudeep Prakash (nephrologist), Col Bharat (urologist), and Col Harman Dhillon (anesthetist) worked alongside SGPGIMS counterparts Dr Narayan Prasad (head of renal transplant program), Dr Mohd S Ansari (surgeon), Dr Ravi Kushwaha (nephrologist), and Dr Divya (anesthetist) for retrieval of two kidneys.For liver retrieval, Col Nishant Pathak and Col Dronacharya Rout from AHRR performed the surgery. Major Maheshwari served as the operation theatre matron.Explaining organ retrieval from a cadaveric donor affected by venom, Dr Narayan Prasad said, “There are two kinds of venom categorised as neurotoxic and haemotoxic, which affect the nervous system and blood stream, respectively, in snake bites. In this case, the snake bite was of neurotoxic nature which blocked neuromuscular junctions but did not damage liver or kidney cells. A metabolic washout was performed using 4-10 litres of ice-cold preservation solution to flush out toxic metabolic waste from the organs. ”“This detox flush turns a tragedy into miracles, as a metabolic washout that turns a damaged, acid-loaded cadaver organ into a clean, cold, viable graft ready for transplantation. Without it, most organs would fail immediately upon reperfusion,” he added.The IAF aircraft landed at CCSIA with the AHRR team at 10.50pm on Thursday and departed with the retrieved liver at 4.05am on Friday. All three transplants were completed before noon.Major General Bhalla said, “All three organs transplanted to three different patients are working perfectly fine.”Lauding the organ donation effort, Surya Command, in a statement, said: “This noble gesture reminds us that the ultimate act of service may come at life’s end, through organ donation. Let this story inspire all to pledge their organs, uphold humanity, and continue the legacy of compassion.”According to the office of UP relief commissioner, at least 365 deaths were reported across UP in the past two months, with 217 deaths in Sept.","Armyman's mother, 59, was working in the farm field in Jaunpur when she was bitten by a snake on Oct 28.

Newsom calls Trump ""dozy don""





Netizens react





President Donald Trump once again was labelled as ""dozy don"" as he appeared to doze off during an Oval Office meeting on tackling obesity.The Oval Office became chaotic when a drug executive collapsed while the Trump administration was announcing lower prices for weight loss drugs for Medicare and Medicaid recipients. In the same event, Trump was photographed leaning back into his chair with his eyes closed.“People can sleep again, because they can breathe when they go to bed,” said Dr Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.As the photograph of Trump with closed eyes during live event went viral, California Governor Gavin Newsom didn't miss a chance to take a swipe on president.Sharing the US President's photo, Trump captioned, ""DOZY DON IS BACK!""Newsom had previously described the President as “Dozy Don” after the Commander-in-Chief appeared to fall asleep last month during a widely criticised Antifa roundtable.The jibe echoed the President’s own nickname for “Sleepy Joe” Biden, who was 81 when he dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and 82 when he completed his term. Trump became the oldest President ever to be sworn in at 78 years and 7 months and will be 82 on leaving office.The President, who often claims to manage on very little sleep and to contact staff at all hours, has also been caught apparently dozing on several occasions.In July he was seen resting his eyes during an energy and innovation event, and last year he closed his eyes during cross-examination of his former attorney Michael Cohen and again when his “hush money” trial involving Stormy Daniels got underway a month earlier, Independent reported.Colorado Representative Lauren Boebert defended him, suggesting he was praying, not sleeping, when he closed his eyes during his trial last year. “But if he is sleeping, he certainly looks pretty while he sleeps,” she said, adding, “Maybe it’s an endearing moment of prayer, though.”The President has previously been dismissive of his need for much sleep, telling supporters on the campaign trail, “You know, I’m not a big sleeper. I like three hours, four hours, I toss, I turn, I beep-de-beep, I want to find out what’s going on.”Last month the President underwent an MRI scan. “It was perfect,” he told reporters afterwards.The photo also stunned several netizens. One of the users said, ""Donald Trump looks like he’s running a country in his dreams. While Americans are working double shifts to afford groceries, he’s in the Oval Office taking power naps between tantrums. The stable genius can’t even stay awake long enough to read a briefing, but he wants the nuclear codes again? America doesn’t need a nap-time dictator, it needs a leader who actually gives a damn. ""Another said, ""There's no need to mention ""Sleepy Joe"" anymore. Now we have 'Dozing Don'.""

"US shutdown hits travelers: Over 1,000 flights canceled; Trump administration warns it could force 20% plane cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-shutdown-hits-travelers-over-1000-flights-canceled-trump-administration-warns-it-could-force-20-plane-cuts/articleshow/125176901.cms,"2000 U.S. Flights Hit Or Grounded As Shutdown Chaos Cripples U.S. Aviation | Crises At Airports

US warns it could force 20% flight cuts









More than 1,000 flights were cancelled across the United States on Friday after the Trump administration ordered reductions to ease strain on air traffic controllers working without pay amid a federal govt shutdown. Forty airports were slated for cuts, including major hubs in Atlanta, Newark, Denver, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles.The flight reductions took effect gradually, starting at four per cent and rising to 10 per cent next week if Congress still had not reached a funding deal. The cancellations followed a bitter standoff between Republicans and Democrats over health insurance subsidies, which led federal agencies to grind to a halt after funding lapsed on October 1, AFP reported.Many govt employees, including vital airport staff, were either working without pay or furloughed at home as the nearly six-week crisis continued. More than 1,000 flights scheduled for Friday were cancelled, according to tracking website FlightAware.The most affected airports late Friday were Reagan National in Washington, Denver International and Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta, data analysed by AFP showed.According to the Federal Aviation Administration, travellers at Reagan National were seeing average delays of four hours, with 90-minute waits in Phoenix and one-hour delays in Chicago and San Francisco.“This is frustrating. We don't need to be in this position,” American Airlines CEO Robert Isom told CNBC.The upheaval meant ordinary Americans were now directly feeling the impacts of the Washington budget fight that had shut down much of the govt. US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed Democrats for the shutdown, saying they should vote to reopen the govt. “If Democrats are going to go home this weekend, and they've kept the government shut down, that's shameful,” Duffy told reporters at Reagan National Airport.In a post on Truth Social, President Donald Trump on Friday also called on Senate lawmakers to remain in Washington until an agreement to end the shutdown was reached. Republicans controlled Congress, but Democrats had said they would refuse to sign off on the majority party's budget plans, including severe healthcare cuts.US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned on Friday he could compel airlines to cut up to 20% of flights if the govt shutdown did not end, as US carriers scrambled to comply with unprecedented govt-imposed reductions, as per Reuters.The Federal Aviation Administration instructed airlines to cut 4% of flights on Friday at 40 major airports, a figure set to rise to 10% by November 14. The cuts began at 6 am ET (1100 GMT) and affect about 700 flights operated by the four largest carriers – American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines. Duffy said the FAA based its decision on safety data, including incidents of planes failing to maintain separation and ground incursions.On Friday air traffic controller absences forced the FAA to delay hundreds of flights at ten airports, including Atlanta, San Francisco, Houston, Phoenix, Washington, DC and Newark. By 7.30 pm ET (1130 GMT) there were more than 5,300 flight delays, according to FlightAware.At Reagan Washington National, delays averaged four hours, while 17% of flights were cancelled and nearly 40% delayed. During the record 38-day govt shutdown 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 security screeners have been compelled to work without pay, leading to increased absenteeism.","More than 1,000 flights were cancelled across the United States on Friday.

SNAP benefits: US federal judge orders Trump administration to release full payments amid shutdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/snap-benefits-us-federal-judge-orders-trump-administration-to-release-full-payments-amid-shutdown/articleshow/125146989.cms,"Trump’s SNAP Cuts Leave Millions Hungry Amid Shutdown; White House Announces 'Partial' Payments





SNAP recipients will now not go without food support, as a US federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to deliver full benefit payments to states by Friday.In Rhode Island on Thursday, US District Judge John J. McConnell Jr. ordered the administration to disburse the payments through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, though it was unlikely the 42 million Americans — about one in eight — would see the money on their food debit cards so swiftly, AP news agency reported.The order followed a challenge by cities and non-profit organisations that the administration had proposed covering only 65 per cent of the maximum benefit, which might leave some recipients without any payment this month.“The defendants failed to consider the practical consequences associated with this decision to only partially fund SNAP,” McConnell said. “They knew that there would be a long delay in paying partial SNAP payments and failed to consider the harms individuals who rely on those benefits would suffer.”McConnell was one of two judges who ruled last week that the administration could not skip November’s benefits entirely because of the federal shutdown.Last week’s rulings required the govt to use an emergency reserve fund containing $4.6 billion to pay for SNAP for November but gave it leeway to tap other money to make the full payments, which cost between $8.5 billion and $9 billion each month.On Monday, the administration said it would not use additional funds, arguing that Congress must appropriate the programme’s money. The following day, President Trump appeared to threaten withholding the benefits entirely unless Congressional Democrats agreed to reopen the government. His press secretary later clarified that partial benefits would be paid for November and that future payments were at risk if the shutdown persisted.Late on Wednesday, the USDA, which administers the programme, filed in federal court in Rhode Island that further analysis had shown the maximum benefit would amount to just 65 per cent of the usual sum.After the US federal government shut down at the start of October, Congress was unable to approve additional spending, resulting in states not receiving funds to top up participants’ SNAP cards. The programme worked by issuing reloadable debit cards that people could use to buy essential grocery items at supermarkets or via Amazon for grocery delivery. Although states administered the programme themselves, they relied heavily on funding from the federal govt.",US judge orders full benefits to be paid to 42 million Americans by Friday. Order follows challenge by cities and non-profit organisations. Two judges ruled last week that the administration could not skip November’s benefits entirely because of the federal shutdown.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125147034,imgsize-88296,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image-ap-photo.jpg"

Trump Takes One Last Jab at Pelosi, Calls Retirement “A Great Thing for the Country”

Nancy Pelosi's historic clashes with Trump









President Donald Trump said Nancy Pelosi's retirement will be a great thing for America as she was 'evil, corrupt and focused on bad things for our country'. Fox News reported Trump's reaction to Pelosi's retirement. ""She was rapidly losing control of her party and it was never coming back. I’m honored she impeached me twice and failed miserably twice. Nancy Pelosi is a highly overrated politician,"" Trump said as reported by Fox's Peter Doocy.The first and only female Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi announced her retirement as she said she would not seek reelection. In a video, she said: ""I have truly loved serving as your voice in Congress, and I have always honored the song of St. Francis, ‘Lord make an instrument of thy peace,’ the anthem of our city. That is why I want you, my fellow San Franciscans, to be the first to know. I will not be seeking reelection to Congress. ""“With a grateful heart, I look forward to my final year of service as your proud representative. As we go forward, my message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power. We have made history. We have made progress. We have always led the way, and now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our Democracy and fighting for the American ideals we hold dear.”There were speculations for days that Pelosi would soon announce her retirement and she was expected to leave Congress after this time, her first in decades as a rank-and-file member.Reflecting on her many roles on Capitol Hill, Pelosi said Thursday: “I say to my colleagues in the House all of the time, no matter what title they had bestowed upon me – speaker, leader, whip – there has been no greater honor for me than to stand on the House floor and say, ‘I speak for the people of San Francisco.’”In September 2019, Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump, citing his solicitation of foreign assistance and a betrayal of national security. The showdown entered public view in dramatic fashion in 2020 when, during Trump’s State of the Union address, Pelosi tore up a copy of his speech immediately after, calling it a “manifesto of mistruths.” After January 6, 2021, Pelosi condemned Trump's role in inciting the the mob, describing his subsequent visit to the Capitol as “returning to the scene of the crime. ”","President Donald Trump said Nancy Pelosi's retirement will be a great thing for America as she was 'evil, corrupt and focused on bad things for our country' The first and only female Speaker of the US House of Representatives announced her retirement as she said she would not seek reelection.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125137197,imgsize-906604,width-400,resizemode-4/donald-trump-said-it39s-great-news-for-america-that-nancy-pelosi-is-retiring.jpg"

US President Donald Trump has once again reiterated his old claim that India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after his intervention.Speaking at an event in Miami, Florida, on Wednesday, Trump added new details to his claims, saying that after his intervention, the next day he received a call claiming that they had made peace after he put out trade conditions.Trump claimed he had solved eight wars in the nine months he had been in office and played a key role in bringing India and Pakistan to a truce. “You know, I was in the midst of a trade deal with both of them (India and Pakistan), and then I read on the front page of a certain newspaper... I heard they were going to war,"" PTI news agency quoted Trump as saying, adding that a total of eight planes had been shot down during the military conflict.His previous claim stood at seven.“I said, this is war, and they are going at it. And they are two nuclear nations. I said, ‘I'm not going to make any trade deals with you guys unless you agree to peace,"" Trump said, adding that his statement took both India and Pakistan by shock.""The two nations said 'No way. This has nothing to do...’ I said, ‘It has everything to do. You are nuclear powers. I'm not trading with you. We're not making any deals with you if you're at war with each other'.""As per the claim made by Trump, this conversation with India and Pakistan took place on May 9. On May 10-2025, both countries announced they had come to a ceasefire understanding and would stop all fighting.""A day later, I get a call saying, 'We made peace'. They stopped. I said, 'Thank you. Let's do trade'. Isn't that great? Tariffs did that… Without tariffs, that would have never happened,"" Trump said amid applause.Trump’s tariff announcement had imposed a 25 percent levy on India in response to what he described as ""the highest tariffs on US goods"" and a 19 percent tariff on Pakistan. He later added an extra 25 percent on India, taking the total to 50 percent, as a penalty for New Delhi’s purchase of Russian oil and its participation in the BRICS bloc, which, according to Trump, fostered anti-American policies.India has repeatedly denied US involvement in the truce. During the G7 Summit in Canada earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi rejected Trump’s claim.“President Trump clearly that during this period, there was no talk at any stage on subjects like India-US trade deal or US mediation between India and Pakistan,” said Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri in a press statement.The conflict between India and Pakistan escalated after New Delhi launched a tri-service strike called ‘ Operation Sindoor ’, targeting terror camps across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The operation followed a terror attack in April in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, in which 26 tourists were killed.","US President Donald Trump has once again reiterated his old claim that India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after his intervention.

US President Donald Trump has thrown his weight behind Indian-origin entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy in the 2026 Ohio governor race, issuing an emphatic endorsement on Truth Social.Calling Ohio a state he “loved” and “WON BIG, THREE TIMES,” Trump described Ramaswamy as the candidate Republicans should unite behind, praising his personality, background and policy agenda.“Vivek Ramaswamy is running for Governor of the Great State of Ohio, a place I love and WON BIG, THREE TIMES, in 2016, 2020, and 2024! I know Vivek well, competed against him, and he is something SPECIAL,” Trump wrote.“He is Young, Strong, and Smart! Vivek is also a very good person, who truly loves our Country.”Trump’s endorsement comes at a crucial moment for Republicans in a state that has shifted steadily to the right over the last decade. The primary field has largely cleared around Ramaswamy, a billionaire entrepreneur and former co-lead of the Department of Government Efficiency alongside Elon Musk. His campaign has pitched him as a conservative outsider with a pro-business, anti-regulation agenda—an approach Trump echoed in his message.“As your next Governor, Vivek will fight tirelessly to Grow the Economy, Cut Taxes and Regulations, Promote MADE IN THE U.S.A., Champion American Energy DOMINANCE, Keep our now very Secure Border, SECURE, Stop Migrant Crime, Strengthen our Military/Veterans, Ensure LAW AND ORDER, Advance Election Integrity, and Protect our always under siege Second Amendment,” Trump said, adding: “Vivek Ramaswamy will be a GREAT Governor of Ohio, and has my Complete and Total Endorsement – HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!”But the race is far from settled. Ohio will have an open governor’s seat once Republican incumbent Mike DeWine leaves office, and Democrats are hoping for an opening. Recent polling has suggested that Democrat Amy Acton, a former state health director, is either narrowly ahead or statistically tied with Ramaswamy. Her campaign says she offers a contrast to a “billionaire Washington insider,” while Ramaswamy’s team has dismissed the polling as politically motivated.Still, Trump’s backing remains a major asset for Republicans in a state he has won comfortably, and where his influence remains strong. Ramaswamy, whose national profile grew during his presidential bid, is expected to lean heavily on Trump’s support as he campaigns across the state. The governor’s race will be decided in November 2026, following primaries in May.","US President Donald Trump has thrown his weight behind Indian-origin entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy in the 2026 Ohio governor race.

US President Donald Trump on Friday said that no American government official would attend the upcoming G20 summit in Johannesburg, calling it a “total disgrace” and citing South Africa’s treatment of white farmers.The summit was set for November 22 and 23, and the announcement overrode plans for Vice President JD Vance to attend in Trump’s place.“No US Government Official will attend as long as these Human Rights abuses continue,” Trump said. “I look forward to hosting the 2026 G20 in Miami, Florida!”Trump claimed that Afrikaners – white South African farmers of mostly Dutch descent in the majority black nation – were “being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated.”The South African govenment strongly denied the accusations of racial discrimination, which Trump had made repeatedly over the past year.The G20 includes the 19 largest world economies, plus the European Union and the African Union, and promotes cooperation to advance global economic interests. In September Trump announced he would host the 2026 G20 Summit at his golf resort in Doral, Florida, the same property near Miami where he had tried unsuccessfully to convene world leaders during his first term.Afrikaners are descendants of Dutch colonists who ruled South Africa under apartheid, a system of legalised segregation that deprived the majority of citizens of basic rights and ended in 1994. Many white South Africans now say they are unfairly targeted by a new law this year that allows the South African govt to seize property for the “public interest” without compensation in some cases.Trump’s support for the Afrikaners dated to his first term but gained force in his second term after the Expropriation Act became law in February. “I am not going,” Trump said on November 5 during a speech in Miami. “We have a G20 meeting in South Africa. South Africa shouldn’t even be in the Gs anymore because what’s happened there is bad.”Upon returning to office in January Trump suspended the refugee admissions programme except for white South Africans, who began arriving in the United States as refugees in May. For 2026 the administration limited refugee admissions to 7,500 – the lowest in history – and most of those admitted would be white South Africans.In the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C. on May 21-2025 President Donald Trump held up a printed article from “American Thinker” while accusing President Cyril Ramaphosa of state-sanctioned violence against white farmers. He later hosted President Ramaphosa for an Oval Office meeting that quickly turned into an ambush as he accused him of overseeing “genocide” against White people and played a video to try to prove the false claim.","US President Donald Trump on Friday said that no American government official would attend the upcoming G20 summit in Johannesburg.

Big Relief For Indians: Donald Trump Clarifies $100K H-1B Fee Won’t Apply To Existing Visa Holders





The Department of Labor has launched at least 175 ongoing investigations into possible H-1B abuses and revealed that there are a bounty of concerns ranging from wage mismatch to work site location. Fox News reported that the investigations found out that some foreign workers with advanced degrees are paid far less than what's mentioned in the job description, forcing American employees with the same qualification to accept lower wages so that they don't lose their jobs.This is the tip of the iceberg as other investigations found that several employers grossly flouted H-1B rules -- did not notify the US Citizenship and Immigration Services when an H-1B visa holder was terminated.""Investigators found that work sites listed on the LCA documents did not exist, or that workers were unaware of the jobs they were supposedly assigned to perform as laid out in the applications. Other investigations found that employees were paid less than what was detailed in an LCA, or that employers were sloppily copying and pasting job notices for American workers that had little connection to the job described in the LCA,"" Fox News reported.Some employees took part in ""benching,"" which is when H-1B visa holders are not paid anything when they are in-between active work projects.""The Labor Department is using every resource currently at our disposal to put a stop to H-1B visa abuse, and for the first time, I am personally certifying investigations into suspected violations to better protect American jobs,"" Labor secretary Chavez-DeRemer told Fox News.H-1B is the visa program through which US companies hire foreign employees for supposedly special high-skilled posts. The Trump administration has cracked down on H-1B and held it liable for America's job crisis.

Pakistan Fires Into Afghanistan, Breaks Ceasefire Amid Turkey Peace Talks: Taliban Confirms





KARACHI: Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif said on Friday that peace talks with Afghanistan in Istanbul aimed at preventing renewed border clashes have collapsed, adding that the ceasefire will hold as long as there are no attacks from Afghan soil, speaking on GEO News.Asif said talks have ""entered an indefinite phase"" as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides. ""Right now, as we speak, negotiations are over,"" he said while speaking on Geo News programme 'Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath'.Earlier, officials confirmed that talks in Istanbul were at a deadlock. The update on the talks by Pakistan's information minister Attaullah Tarar came after an Afghan official said four Afghan civilians were killed and five others wounded in clashes between Pakistani and Afghan forces along their shared border despite the joint negotiations.In a statement thanking Turkiye and Qatar for mediating the talks, Tarar maintained Afghan Taliban has failed to meet pledges it made with the international community about curbing terrorism under a 2021 Doha peace accord.","Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif said peace talks with Afghanistan in Istanbul aimed at preventing renewed border clashes have collapsed.

'A shame': Barlow on Indira Gandhi not approving joint India-Israel strike on Pakistan's nuclear facility





NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s initial motive for developing nuclear weapons — to counter India — gradually evolved into an effort to create an “Islamic bomb” aimed at aiding other Muslim nations, including Iran, according to former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer Richard Barlow.Barlow, who served as a counter-proliferation officer during the 1980s when Islamabad was covertly advancing its nuclear programme, attributed this shift in intent to Abdul Qadeer Khan, widely regarded as the father of Pakistan’s atomic weapons project.“Pakistan’s primary motive for developing nuclear weapons was to counter India. But it was also very clear from AQ Khan and the generals’ perspective that it was not just the Pakistani bomb; it was the Islamic bomb — the Muslim bomb,” Barlow told news agency ANI.“I think AQ Khan was even quoted once as saying, ‘We’ve got the Christian bomb, the Jewish bomb, and the Hindu bomb; we need a Muslim bomb.’ It was very clear to me that Pakistan intended to provide nuclear weapons technology to other Muslim countries — which is what happened,” he added.However, the phrase “Muslim bomb” did not originate with Khan but with then Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who initiated Pakistan’s nuclear programme and placed Khan at its helm.Meanwhile, Barlow also alleged that Washington’s response to Islamabad’s secret nuclear dealings was marked by “negligence.”“Not only did they (the United States) shut down from doing anything about that in 1987 and 1988, but they did nothing for the next 20 to 24 years,” he remarked.Today, only nine countries possess nuclear weapons: Russia, the United States, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea — the number of weapons in that order.While India adheres to a No First Use (NFU) policy, pledging not to use nuclear weapons unless attacked first, Pakistan imposes no such restriction on itself.US President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that the conflict between India and Pakistan in May, was on the verge of turning nuclear, but that his “intervention” prevented an escalation and led to a ceasefire.Barlow also claimed that a proposal by Israel to jointly bomb with India, Pakistan's Kahuta nuclear facility in the early 1980s could have ""solved a lot of problems.""The disapproval by the Indira Gandhi government was a ""shame,"" he said.""I was out of government from 1982 until 1985. And I think that may have occurred while I was out of government. I heard about it at some point. But I didn't get my teeth into it because it never happened. It's a shame that Indira Gandhi didn't approve it; it would have solved a lot of problems,"" he stated.According to reports and declassified accounts, Israel and India had planned a pre-emptive airstrike on Pakistan's Kahuta uranium enrichment plant -- the core of its nuclear programme -- to prevent Islamabad from developing and proliferating nuclear weapons, particularly to Iran, which is regarded as a ""grave adversary"" by Israel .Barlow suggested that the US administration at the time, under then-President Ronald Reagan, would have strongly opposed any such strike, particularly from Israel, as it could have disrupted America's covert war effort against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.","Former CIA counter-proliferation officer Richard Barlow says Pakistan's initial motive for developing nuclear weapons was to counter India.

The incident followed Taliban claims that Pakistan had carried out airstrikes inside Afghan territory, an accusation Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.Islamabad has consistently urged the Taliban to prevent militant groups from using Afghan soil to launch attacks on Pakistan, a charge the Taliban firmly reject.","Pakistan fired into Afghanistan, breaking the ceasefire, as officials are in Istanbul to resume discussions with Taliban representatives.

Ceasefire talks continue amid mistrust





Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar has admitted that he negotiated several agreements with the Taliban administration in Kabul, but was unable to implement any of them because Islamabad had not authorised him to make final decisions. Speaking in parliament, and quoted by TOLOnews, Dar said his visit to Afghanistan had been positive but ultimately meaningless due to the Pakistani government’s restrictions on his authority.Dar told lawmakers: “The meetings were very positive; I was warmly received. I didn’t leave the work unfinished there. I know our system does not allow me to make decisions. I wanted to return and implement all that was agreed upon, but the system doesn’t allow it.”His admission highlights growing institutional disarray in Islamabad as the government struggles to manage one of Pakistan’s most volatile diplomatic relationships. It also comes at a time when Pakistan and the Taliban are holding fresh talks to prevent a return to deadly border clashes.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif confirmed on Wednesday that a delegation had left for Istanbul to resume discussions with Taliban representatives.Asif told reporters the delegation would begin negotiations on Thursday, saying: “Let’s hope Afghanistan makes use of wisdom and peace is restored in the region.” He added that Pakistan’s demand remained unchanged — that Afghanistan “clamp down on attacks originating from its soil”.According to Dawn, the latest meetings follow days of heavy border hostilities and previously failed negotiations. A fragile ceasefire is currently in place and both sides agreed to three basic principles: continuation of the truce, a monitoring and verification mechanism, and penalties for any violations. Operational details are expected to be finalised in Istanbul.Despite this, mistrust remains deep. Islamabad accuses the Taliban of sheltering militant groups responsible for attacks inside Pakistan, while Kabul accuses Pakistan of repeated violations of Afghan sovereignty. The Taliban also refuses to recognise the Durand Line, the internationally accepted boundary between the neighbours.Border closures in October caused significant economic losses, and more than 70 people were killed in recent clashes.",Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar has admitted that he negotiated several agreements with the Taliban administration in Kabul.

Polish FM Snubs Pak FM Ishaq Dar's 'Kashmir' Rant, Issues Warning On Illegal Immigration

.





Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar has said that a symbolic “cup of tea” in Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, turned out to be a costly mistake for Pakistan. He reiterated that such a mistake should never be repeated.Speaking in the Senate on Wednesday, Dar criticised the previous Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government, saying that under the pretext of that “cup of tea,” Pakistan had opened its borders to Afghanistan. He described this move as a serious error in judgment.“It was a big mistake and should not be repeated,” Dar said, news agency ANI reported, quoting Afghanistan’s Tolo News.Dar’s comments referred to the 2021 visit of the then-ISI chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, to Kabul shortly after the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan following the withdrawal of US and allied forces.Recalling his earlier remarks made in London last year, Dar said Pakistan was “still paying the price” for that decision.He linked the surge in terrorist attacks in Pakistan to militant groups allegedly operating from Afghan soil, including the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Fitna al-Khawarij, and the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), according to ARY News.Dar added that he had held six phone conversations with Afghanistan’s foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, to raise Pakistan’s concerns and demand that Afghan territory not be used for terrorist activities.However, Afghanistan’s ministry of foreign affairs has rejected Dar’s claim.In a post on X, ministry spokesperson Hafiz Zia Ahmad said the Pakistani minister’s statements “lacked accuracy,” clarifying that the phone conversation took place in a spirit of “mutual understanding and coordination.”""The recent statements by the Pakistani Foreign Minister, in which he claimed that the Foreign Minister of the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan, Mullah Amir Khan Muttaqi, had contacted him six times in one day, lack accuracy and realism. In fact, the first phone contact between the two sides was aimed at mutual understanding and coordination,"" the post read.Ahmad further said Dar had initially mentioned not being fully briefed on the issue and would follow up after reviewing the matter.Despite the tensions, Dar expressed hope that upcoming talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan scheduled for November 6 in Istanbul would help strengthen cooperation on security issues.Last month, relations between the two neighbours deteriorated after Pakistan carried out airstrikes inside Afghan territory, prompting retaliatory fire from the Afghan side and intense border clashes.Following mediation by Qatar and Turkiye, both countries agreed to a ceasefire, which was later extended. The Istanbul meeting will focus on finalising steps for its continued implementation, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.","Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar has said that a symbolic “cup of tea” in Afghanistan”s capital, Kabul, turned out to be a costly mistake for Pakistan.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment





The Pakistan government announced plans to introduce the 27th Constitutional Amendment, which includes proposed changes related to the command of the armed forces. The amendment will be tabled in Parliament soon, deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar confirmed on Tuesday.“Of course, the government is bringing it and will bring it … the 27th Amendment will arrive … and is about to arrive. We will try that it be tabled in accordance with principles, laws and the Constitution,” Dar said in the Senate, as quoted by PTI.According to sources, the proposed amendment includes provisions to set up a constitutional court, streamline the process for appointing the chief election commissioner, amend Article 243 dealing with matters of the armed forces, reduce the provinces’ share in federal resources, and transfer control of the education and population welfare ministries from provinces to the federal government.Article 243 of the Constitution states that “the federal government shall have control and command of the armed forces.” The proposal to revise this article is being viewed as a move that could further strengthen the position of Army Chief General Asim Munir and expand the military’s role in national affairs.Dar rejected concerns that the amendment might be passed without proper procedure. “It is not the case that the amendment is tabled and there is voting on it in a haphazard, ad hoc manner; this will not happen,” he said.He said the amendment would first be introduced in the Senate and then referred to a bipartisan committee for discussion, adding that the government would welcome positive suggestions to improve the draft.PPP Senator Raza Rabbani said the changes would damage provincial autonomy and “undo the good work of the 18th amendment,” which devolved powers to the provinces in 2010.The government has the required two-thirds majority in the 336-member National Assembly with the support of 233 members. In the 96-member Senate, it holds 61 seats and will need at least three opposition members to pass the amendment.The secrecy around the proposed changes, particularly the plan to amend Article 243, has drawn attention to whether the new constitutional move will give the armed forces greater influence in the country’s governance.","Pakistani government announces plans to introduce the 27th Constitutional Amendment.

NEW DELHI: At least 12 people were injured in an explosion in the Pakistan Supreme Court basement that jolted the building. The blast was caused by a cylinder bursting in the court's basement cafeteria.

A gas cylinder exploded in the basement cafeteria of the Supreme Court of Pakistan building in Islamabad early Tuesday morning, causing the building to tremble and injuring around a dozen people, according to law-enforcement authorities and media reports.According to Ali Nasir Rizvi, Islamabad’s inspector general of police, the isolated incident occurred in the court’s canteen while an air-conditioning unit was being repaired.He confirmed that “a gas explosion occurred in the Supreme Court canteen at 10:55am (local time).” He added that “experts have also confirmed that it was a gas explosion.”The IG further pointed out that “there had been a gas leak in the canteen for several days” and that the technicians repairing the AC sustained the most serious injuries, with one technician suffering burns on 80 per cent of his body.Following the blast, around 15 people were shifted to hospital treatment centres; of these, 12 were confirmed injured by the IG. Among them, three were admitted to the Pakistan institute of medical sciences (PIMS) and nine to the Polyclinic Hospital. He noted that “the condition of two individuals is critical.”Emergency procedures were rapidly activated: lawyers and court officials evacuated the building and moved to open areas outside, and the bomb disposal squad screened the affected zone. The building’s canteen reportedly suffered damage to furniture, and the shock-wave from the explosion was felt through the lower floors of the court complex.While investigations are ongoing, the IG called attention to the pre-existing gas leak and the maintenance work being carried out on the AC system as key factors in the incident.","A gas cylinder exploded in the basement cafeteria of the Supreme Court of Pakistan building in Islamabad early Tuesday morning.
