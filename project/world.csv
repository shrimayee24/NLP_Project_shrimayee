NEW DELHI: In a strong show of support for the Tibetan cause, a cross-party forum of MPs has passed a resolution urging the government to confer the Bharat Ratna on the Dalai Lama and allow him to address a joint sitting of Parliament -- a move that’s likely to irk China once again.The all-party Indian parliamentary forum for Tibet, which includes MPs from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Biju Janata Dal (BJD) and Janata Dal (United), adopted the resolutions during its second meeting this month. The group had drawn sharp criticism from Beijing following its inaugural sitting in December last year.Led by BJD Rajya Sabha MP Sujeeth Kumar, the 10-member committee has also launched a signature campaign supporting the Dalai Lama's Bharat Ratna nomination.“We have initiated a signature campaign to award Bharat Ratna to His Holiness Dalai Lama. Many MPs have come forward and some of them have sent video messages supporting the campaign. We will be writing to the Speaker of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha to convene a joint sitting which will be addressed by His Holiness,” Kumar, who is also the convenor of the forum said, according to ET.Members of the forum, which includes BJP MPs Ashok Bajpai, Lahar Singh Siroya, Vinay Dinu Tendulkar, Tapir Gao and Rajendra Agrawal, strongly opposed China’s interference in the spiritual succession of the Tibetan leader.They emphasised that the people of Tibet alone have the right to decide on the reincarnation of the 14th Dalai Lama.Taking the campaign a step further, Arunachal Pradesh MP Tapir Gao proposed a mass rally in support of Tibet to raise public awareness.""He further suggested that the Dalai Lama address the Central Hall of the Parliament on topics such as peace and compassion,"" stated the resolution.The forum has also expressed admiration for a recent pro-Tibet bill passed by the US Congress and encouraged similar legislation to be introduced in India's Parliament. Additionally, members discussed the implementation of the 2014 Tibetan Rehabilitation Policy, urging fellow MPs to visit Tibetan settlements and press local administrations for basic amenities.""We have requested all the MPs to reach out to the district administration and respective state governments so that land and amenities such as roads, electrification and drinking water are ensured for Tibetan rehabilitation,"" Kumar added.As per the 2014 policy guidelines issued by the Union home ministry, state governments are required to lease land occupied by Tibetan refugees for 20 years, issue rent tenancy certificates, and ensure welfare benefits and infrastructure support in settlements.""The land under the occupation by the Tibetan refugees should not be disturbed and welfare benefits of state government schemes should be extended to them. The state authorities have been advised to extend the infrastructural facilities and basic amenities like roads, electrification, drinking water schemes in or around the Tibetan settlements,"" said the home ministry’s directive.The forum’s assertiveness marks a renewed political engagement with the Tibetan cause -- one that continues to test India's diplomatic balancing act with China.",A cross-party forum of MPs has passed a resolution urging the government to confer the Bharat Ratna on the Dalai Lama.

However, due to rising conflict in the region, they were unable to continue working and expressed their desire to return home.""Upon receiving information about their situation, I immediately contacted the Minister of External Affairs. Emergency food supplies were arranged for the stranded fishermen on one of the islands. Efforts are also underway to rescue more fishermen from another island,"" Nagendran said.ince direct flights from Iran were not feasible, the fishermen were brought to Dubai by ship and, from there, flown to Delhi, eventually reaching Chennai.

PUNE: The Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) in Pune on Saturday recorded the statement of the 22-year-old data scientist related to her complaint that she was allegedly raped by an unidentified delivery agent in her rented Kondhwa flat on Wednesday evening. Police said they produced the complainant before the court as she kept changing her statements during questioning.Deputy commissioner of police (Zone V) Rajkumar Shinde told TOI: ""We produced the woman before the CJM, Ms T M Ahmed, and the process of recording her statement under provisions of Section 183 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) was completed."" The section empowers a magisterial court to record the confession of an accused or the statement of a witness.Shinde said the FIR the woman, who has a BE degree and works with an IT firm in Kalyaninagar, had filed with the Kondhwa police on Thursday and her subsequent statements had numerous discrepancies. ""She continuously changed her statements during questioning,"" he said.On Thursday, the Kondhwa police had registered a case of rape, voyeurism and criminal intimidation based on the woman's complaint stating that a ""delivery agent"" stepped into her house on the pretext of delivering a parcel and getting a delivery sheet acknowledged, sprayed some chemical on her face to render her unconscious and later sexually assaulted herCity police commissioner Amitesh Kumar on Friday said investigation into the alleged rape revealed that there was ""no forced entry into the woman's flat, no chemical was sprayed to render her unconscious and the selfie on her cellphone was taken with her consent before she cropped the image"".Police had detained her friend (24), an IT professional with a firm in Baner, after evidence like his cellphone location showed that he was around the flat at the time of the alleged incident. The DCP on Saturday said the police released the woman's friend for now, but served a notice on him with a direction to join the investigation.Shinde said the process to record the complainant's statement by a magisterial court was crucial under the provisions relating to rape or sexual assault of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) ""to ensure voluntariness and reliability of such statements"" during investigation. ""It ensures transparency. Since her statement is recorded, the investigating officer can continue the investigation based on her voluntary disclosure before the CJM,"" he said.A senior police officer privy to the investigation said: ""We questioned the complainant on material points. She gave multiple oral and written statements, but they were found contradictory and misleading during verification. Her statements are not consistent with the FIR. A call to take action against her would be taken based on the outcome of the investigation. She would be referred to a counselling session.""Sources in the sessions court said the investigating officer took the CJM's permission for securing the woman's presence to record her statement because of the complexity of the case. The court considered the officer's request and recorded her statement in camera. The woman's statement was sealed in an envelope soon after it was recorded. The sealed envelope has been kept in the safe custody of the court ‘nazir' (assistant superintendent).The investigating officer will now have to secure a certified copy of her statement by seeking the court's permission. The purpose of recording her statement before the court under Section 183 of BNSS is to create a reliable record of a witness. This process aims at detering witnesses from subsequently changing their testimonies, minimise perjury and provide more trustworthy accounts of events, especially when compared to statements taken during the investigation, sources said.The CJM court's assistant public prosecutor, Priyanka Vengurlekar, confirmed that the woman's statement was recorded, but said its contents could not be made public.",The Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) in Pune on Saturday recorded the statement of the 22-year-old data scientist related to her complaint that she was allegedly raped by an unidentified delivery agent.

PM Modi joins BRICS leaders for family photo at 17th BRICS Summit in Rio

'Iran Won't Stop': Khamenei Aide's JAW-DROPPING Speech At BRICS Sends Shockwaves In Israel & U.S.

NEW DELHI: The 11-member BRICS comprising key emerging economies condemned in “the strongest terms” the Pahalgam terrorist attack, seeking concerted action against UN-designated terrorists and terrorist entities, and unambiguously backed a comprehensive reform of the UN Security Council (UNSC), in 2 significant takeaways for India from the Rio Summit.Among other highlights was India joining BRICS in condemning attacks on Iran since June 13 (without naming Israel), expressing grave concern about the situation in “Occupied Palestinian territory” with the resumption of “continuous Israeli attacks” against Gaza, obstruction to humanitarian aid and use of starvation as a method of warfare – something which Israel has rejected.According to the Rio Declaration, BRICS nations expressed serious concerns about the rise of unilateral tariff and non-tariff measures which distort trade and are inconsistent with WTO rules.While this was an obvious message to the Trump administration, the declaration stopped short of naming the US because some members were not comfortable with it. The declaration also said that the imposition of unilateral coercive measures are contrary to international law and measures like unilateral economic sanctions have far-reaching negative implications.At India’s behest, there was ample focus on terrorism in the declaration that urged zero tolerance for terrorism and rejected double standards in countering terrorism. India uses the same language to counter Pakistan’s support to cross-border terrorism and also China’s shielding at the UN of UN-banned terrorists based in Pakistan.“We condemn in the strongest terms the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir on 22 April 2025, during which at least 26 people were killed and many more injured. We reaffirm our commitment to combating terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations, including the cross-border movement of terrorists, terrorism financing and safe havens,” said the declaration, while calling for an expeditious finalization and adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism in the UN framework.According to Indian government officials, the Rio summit also adopted “strongest-ever language” for UN reforms by calling for a comprehensive reform of the Security Council with a view to making it more democratic, representative, effective and efficient, and toincrease the representation of developing countries. Recalling the 2022 Beijing and 2023Johannesburg Declarations, China and Russia, as permanent members of the UNSC, reiterated their support to the aspirations of Brazil and India to play a greater role in the United Nations, including its Security Council. Interestingly, the Beijing declaration had only said in the UN, and not 'including in UNSC'. The Rio Declaration also said a reformed UNSC will amplify the voice of the Global South.While condemning the attacks on Iran – and expressing concern over “deliberate” attacks on “peaceful” nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards – the declaration was also littered with references to the Israel-Palestine issue, something which continues to test India’s balancing exercise. In the case of Iran, there was no mention of Israel like in an earlier statement by BRICS last month, which too was endorsed by India, but on this occasion the declaration didn’t just express concern but also condemned the military strikes.In the case of Gaza, the declaration explicitly mentioned “continuous Israeli attacks” calling for adherence to international law and recalling that the Gaza Strip is an inseparable part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It also called for full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip while seeking talks for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.However, while the Rio summit cranked up the pressure on Israel by mentioning allegations like the use of starvation, this is not the first time that India has joined BRICS in condemning some of Israel’s actions in Gaza. It did so in a meeting of the foreign ministers in June last year and again at the Kazan summit where BRICS denounced Israel’s attacks against humanitarian operations and facilities.",The 11-member BRICS comprising key emerging economies condemned in ‘the strongest terms’ the Pahalgam terrorist attack.

Officials hopeful they won't need to serve ex-CJI eviction notice



With Supreme Court taking an unusual step of asking the govt to take back the official bungalow of CJI at 5, Krishna Menon Marg, officials are hopeful of the situation sorting out itself sparing them of an unpleasant task of serving eviction notice to a former CJI. Media reports quoted ex-CJI D Y Chandrachud as saying they (he & family) are set to move out in a few days.Amid media reports quoted ex-CJI D Y Chandrachud saying they (he & family) are set to move out and it was only a matter of a few days, officials in the housing and urban affairs ministry said they are hopeful that there would be no need for serving an eviction notice. Officials said this is perhaps for the first time when the SC administration has asked it to get a bungalow vacated from a former CJI and return it to the SC housing pool for fresh allotment.They added that for them it was a peculiar situation since the bungalow is placed under the SC housing pool and it is the apex court which takes a call on allotment. In a July 1 letter to the housing and urban affairs secretary, the SC administration had pointed out that the time allowed for the former CJI to vacate the official accommodation had expired, and hence, the bungalow must be vacated without delay.Sources said SC authorities wrote to the ministry as all govt accommodations, including those meant for judges and belonging to the SC pool, fall under the ministry's jurisdiction and it is the ministry that is responsible for carrying out any eviction.SC is in need of official accommodation for four judges, sources said.Rule 3B of the SC Judges Rules, 2022, allows retired CJIs to retain their bungalow for up to six months after retirement. Justice Chandrachud, who retired as CJI in Nov 2024, has been staying there. In Dec, he wrote to his successor and former CJI Justice Sanjiv Khanna, seeking time until April 30, 2025, to retain the bungalow, and this was allowed.Again in April, he wrote to the then CJI, Khanna, seeking time until June 30, citing difficulty in finding a suitable accommodation.","Officials hopeful they won't need to serve ex-CJI eviction notice.

Police say woman's mental health 'not good'

NEW DELHI: Pune Police on Sunday ruled out a rape claim by a 22-year-old data scientist, calling it a ""false complaint"" that misled cops. Police commissioner Amitesh Kumar said the woman's report, which included allegations of assault by an unknown man posing as a delivery agent, was fabricated.The woman had alleged that a stranger, pretending to be a courier delivery man, entered her Kondhwa flat on Wednesday, bolted the door, sprayed a chemical to knock her unconscious, and raped her. She claimed the assailant took a selfie using her phone and left behind a threatening message.But within 24 hours, police uncovered inconsistencies in her statement.""It was found that the woman had filed a false complaint. Her complaint misled the Pune Police,"" Kumar said.He added, ""Just two days ago, an incident came before Pune City Police, which was used to create a narrative that law and order concerning women in Pune has completely collapsed, and efforts were made to portray Pune as unsafe for women. By deploying the full resources of the police administration, we solved the case within 24 hours. No one should try to defame Pune, a city known to be one of the safest, through fake narratives.According to the investigation, the man in the selfie was known to the woman. ""They have known each other for years and belong to the same community,"" Kumar said a few days back, as quoted by PTI. ""The selfie was taken by the woman herself and later edited to partially hide his face. The threatening message was typed by her too.""The man, reportedly a highly qualified professional, was detained and questioned. Forensic analysis found no evidence of a chemical attack, and CCTV footage showed no unknown visitor entering the housing complex. The apartment's digital entry system also recorded no delivery agents at the time.Kumar said, ""No chemical spray was used. The girl’s mental state is not good at present. The rape part is still under investigation.""The case had initially been registered under sections 64 (rape), 77 (voyeurism), and 351(2) (criminal intimidation) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. Forensic teams collected samples from the crime scene, and her phone was seized for digital analysis. The selfie and text message were central to the original claim.The woman, an IT professional living in Pune's Kalyaninagar area with her younger brother, was alone at the time of the alleged incident.","Pune Police rule out rape claim by 22-year-old data scientist, calling it a ""false complaint"" Police commissioner Amitesh Kumar said the woman's report was fabricated.

China 'deployed' embassies to undermine Rafale: French intel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/china-deployed-embassies-to-undermine-rafale-french-intel/articleshow/122286606.cms,"PARIS: China deployed its embassies to spread doubts about the performance of French-made Rafale jets after they saw combat in India and Pakistan's clashes in May, French military and intelligence officials have concluded, implicating Beijing in an effort to hammer the reputation and sales of France's flagship fighter.Findings from a French intelligence service seen by Associated Press say defence attaches in China's foreign embassies led a charge to undermine Rafale sales, seeking to persuade countries that have already ordered the French-made fighter - notably Indonesia - not to buy more and to encourage other potential buyers to choose Chinese-made planes. The findings were shared with AP by a French military official .Four days of India-Pakistan clashes in May were the most serious confrontation in years between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, and included air combat that involved dozens of aircraft from both sides. Military officials and researchers have since been digging for details of how Pakistan's Chinese-made military hardware - particularly warplanes and air-combat missiles - fared against weaponry that India used in airstrikes on Pakistani targets, notably French-made Rafale fighters.Sales of Rafales and other armaments are big business for France's defence industry and help efforts by govt in Paris to strengthen ties with other nations, including in Asia where China is becoming the dominant regional power.Pakistan claimed its air force downed five Indian planes during the fighting, including three Rafales. French officials say that prompted questions about their performance from countries that have bought the fighter from French manufacturer Dassault Aviation.India acknowledged aircraft losses but didn't say how many. French air force chief Gen Jerome Bellanger said that he's seen evidence pointing to just 3 Indian losses - a Rafale, a Russian-made Sukhoi and a Mirage 2000.It was the first known combat loss of a Rafale. French officials have been battling to protect the plane from reputational damage, pushing back against what they allege was a concerted campaign of Rafale-bashing and disinformation online from Pakistan and its ally China. They say the campaign included viral posts on social media, manipulated imagery showing supposed Rafale debris, AI-generated content and video-game depictions to simulate supposed combat. French military officials say they haven't been able to link the online Rafale-bashing directly to Chinese govt.But the French intelligence service said Chinese embassy defence attaches echoed the same narrative in meetings they held with security and defence officials from other countries, arguing that IAFRafales performed poorly and promoting Chinese-made weaponry.Asked by AP to comment on the alleged effort to dent Rafale's appeal, ministry of national defence in Beijing said: ""The relevant claims are pure groundless rumours. China has consistently maintained a prudent approach to military exports, playing a constructive role in regional and global peace and stability."" AP","China deployed its embassies to spread doubts about the performance of French- made Rafale jets after they saw combat in India and Pakistan's clashes in May, French military and intelligence officials have concluded. Findings from a French intelligence service seen by Associated Press say defence attaches in China's foreign embassies led a charge to undermine Rafale sales.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122286609,imgsize-584587,width-400,resizemode-4/122286609.jpg"

"Suicide or murder? DOJ, FBI drop big update on Jeffrey Epstein death; debunk conspiracy theories",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/suicide-or-murder-doj-fbi-drop-big-update-on-jeffrey-epstein-death-debunk-conspiracy-theories/articleshow/122288286.cms,"Confusion around his death







The US department of justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation concluded that there was no evidence that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was murdered, Axios reported on Monday citing a memo. It also said that the investigators found no indication that Epstein blackmailed powerful figures or maintained a “client list”.The memo noted that no further charges would be filed against others linked to Epstein’s case; his associate Ghislaine Maxwell is already serving a 20-year sentence for child sex trafficking and related crimes.The findings mark the first time Trump’s administration has officially pushed back against conspiracy theories surrounding Jeffrey Epstein’s activities and death, theories that had previously been promoted by the FBI’s top two officials before Trump appointed them to lead the bureau.As prominent voices in MAGA circles, Kash Patel (now FBI director) and Dan Bongino (now deputy director) were among those who once questioned the official account of Epstein’s death.Both Patel and Bongino have since said that Epstein died by suicide. Still, belief that Epstein’s crimes implicated powerful figures, and that he was murdered to cover them up, remains widespread online, especially on the right.Moreover, during Elon Musk's fall out with Trump last month, he accused the US president of being “in the Epstein files.”Trump responded by sharing a statement from former Epstein lawyer David Schoen, who said Trump wasn’t implicated in any crime. Musk later deleted his posts, admitting he “went too far.”The administration is releasing both raw and enhanced video footage showing no one entered the area of Epstein’s Manhattan prison cell on the night he died in 2019. The footage backs the medical examiner’s conclusion that Epstein’s death was a suicide, according to a two-page memo, according to Axios news report.""The FBI enhanced the relevant footage by increasing its contrast, balancing the color, and improving its sharpness for greater clarity and viewability,"" it reported quoting the memo.Investigators found ""no incriminating 'client list' "" of Epstein's, ""no credible evidence ... that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals,"" and no ""evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties,"" the memo added.","Jeffrey Epstein was convicted of child sex trafficking and related crimes.

BHOPAL: In a rare gesture of ‘Ganga-Jamuni' tehzeeb in Bhander town of Datia district of Madhya Pradesh, tazias (Muharram tableaux) by the Muslim community first paid ‘salami' to Lord Krishna before moving to Karbala on Sunday. This was not a rare occasion but an age-old ritual followed in the town.The approximately 200-year-old Chaturbhuj Krishna temple was constructed by a Muslim family in Bhander town. Ever since, it has become a tradition for the tazias to stop before the temple for ‘salami' to Chaturbhuj Maharaj (Lord Krishna) before moving ahead.Also read: Processions & rituals mark Muharram Bhander Karbala committee chief Abdul Jabbar told TOI, ""This year we had 37 tazias, and on the last day, the route passes first through Chaturbhuj Maharaj temple and then to the Karbala. The tazias first pay ‘salami' before moving ahead. The priest of the temple comes out and blesses the tazias.""He added, ""I am 63 years old and I have seen it since my childhood. The idol at the temple was found centuries ago by a local Muslim family named the Hazari family in Sontalai, a pond situated in the town. The family then built the temple.""He continued, ""Our elders used to tell us when we were kids that on ‘gyaras' when temple idols come out for a holy bath, the idol used to come out only after at least one member of the Hazari family was present.In their absence, even hundreds of men would not be able to lift or move the idol. Later, close to the country's Independence, only one elderly female member of the Hazari family was alive. She too was bedridden, and on gyaras when people couldn't lift the idol, she was somehow brought to the temple. The folklore says, ‘here she prayed and told the idol, Ab uth jaana, koi nahi aa payega humare parivar se' (from now on get lifted, no one from our family will be able to come now). It is said, people were able to move the idol since then.""According to the priest at the temple, who has been serving here for generations, the Hazari family not only built the temple but also donated land for it. ""The temple has around 5 bighas of land donated by the Muslim family that built it. It's a nearly 200-year-old temple. My maternal grandfather used to be the priest there. After his death, my father became the priest, and after his death, I am the priest,"" says Ramesh Panda, 67.""The temple was not only built by a Muslim family but guarded by Muslims. I remember decades ago there was communal tension. At that time, police arrived here but local Muslims came forward assuring the administration that they would guard the temple and no police or force was required,"" he added.","The approximately 200-year-old Chaturbhuj Krishna temple was constructed by a Muslim family in Bhander town.

More assistance needed





DAMASCUS: Syrian authorities said some 100 square kilometres (40 square miles) of forest had ""turned to ash"" in wildfires as firefighters from neighbouring Jordan arrived Sunday to battle a fourth day of blazes in the province of Latakia.Syrian emergency workers have faced tough conditions including high temperatures, strong winds, rugged mountainous terrain in the coastal province and the danger of explosive war remnants, in a country worn down by years of conflict and economic crisis.An AFP correspondent in Latakia's Rabiaa region saw emergency workers battling a blaze near homes, while vast swathes of forest and olive groves were burnt and smoke filled the air over a long distance.Jordanian civil defence teams crossed into Syria on Sunday morning, the Syrian ministry for emergencies and disaster management said, after Turkey sent assistance a day earlier.Minister Raed al-Saleh said on X that ""hundreds of thousands of forest trees over an estimated area of around 10,000 hectares (25,000 acres) in 28 locations have turned to ash"".He later decried ""a real environmental disaster"" at a press conference in the province.More than 80 teams including civil defence personnel have been helping battle the blaze, he said, noting local organisations and residents were also providing assistance, in addition to teams and firefighting aircraft from neighbouring Jordan and Turkey.Saleh said it would take days to declare the blazes completely extinguished once the fire was brought under control, calling them ""catastrophic"".Syria's defence ministry said the air force was assisting, publishing images of a helicopter collecting and dropping water.Jordan's public security directorate said in a statement that the ""specialised firefighting teams from the civil defence... have been provided with all the modern equipment and machinery necessary to carry out their duties to the fullest extent"".Swathes of forested area and farmland have burnt and some villages evacuated as the fires raged including near the Turkish border.The United Nations deputy envoy to Syria Najat Rochdi said in a statement Sunday on X that Damascus ""needs more international assistance"" to face the fires.A statement from the UN resident and humanitarian coordinator for Syria Adam Abdelmoula said that ""UN teams are on the ground conducting urgent assessments to determine the scale of the disaster and to identify the most immediate humanitarian needs"".Nearly seven months after the ousting of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad, Syria is still reeling from more than a decade of civil war that ravaged the country's economy, infrastructure and public services.With man-made climate change increasing the likelihood and intensity of droughts and wildfires worldwide, Syria has also been battered by heatwaves and low rainfall.In June, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation told AFP that Syria had ""not seen such bad climate conditions in 60 years"".","Syrian authorities say 100 square kilometres of forest has ""turned to ash"" in wildfires.

A US coast guard rescue swimmer is being hailed as an “American hero” after saving 165 lives during his first-ever mission, a response to deadly flash flooding in Texas that has claimed the lives of at least 82 people, with many still unaccounted for.Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem praised the mission online, calling Scott Ruskan an “American hero” whose courage “embodies the spirit and mission of the Coast Guard.”But Ruskan quickly shared the credit. “Honestly, I’m mostly just a dude. I’m just doing a job,” he said. “Whoever it may be, would have done the exact same thing in our situation.""Scott Ruskan, 26, a New Jersey native and former accountant, had only recently completed his coast guard training when he was called into action on the fourth of July.“This is what it’s all about, right? Like, this is why we do the job,” said Ruskan as quoted by The New York Post. “This is why like Coast Guard men and women, are risking their lives every day.”Ruskan, who grew up in Oxford, New Jersey, enlisted in 2021. After finishing basic training and Aviation Survival Technician school in California, he was stationed in Corpus Christi, Texas. He had been training and preparing since November, waiting for a mission that finally came during the holiday weekend.Texas Task Force 1, a partnership between the Texas army national guard and Texas A&M, contacted the coast guard asking for urgent help.“That’s a little bit outside our area of operation normally, but people were in danger, and we’re a good asset to try and help people out, and these guys were asking for help, so that’s kind of what we do,” said Ruskan.By early Friday, coast guard MH-65 and Army Blackhawk helicopters were in the air headed to Camp Mystic, a Christian girls’ summer camp hit hard by the floods. Five young campers, ages 8 and 9, were confirmed dead. A counselor and 11 more girls were still missing.With limited space in the helicopters, the rescue crew decided to leave Ruskan on the ground to direct the triage operation. He helped guide choppers to pockets of survivors, tended to the injured, and tried to comfort cold, frightened children and adults still in pajamas after fleeing their bunks overnight.Over several hours, Ruskan worked through the chaos to help evacuate 165 people to safety.“So we basically got the majority of the people out of Camp Mystic, which is awesome. And I feel like we did a lot of good that day, but obviously it’s still super sad,” he said. “There’s still a lot of people missing and unaccounted for, so the mission’s not over yet. It’s not over for us.”","Scott Ruskan, 26, is a New Jersey native and former accountant. Ruskan had only recently completed his coast guard training when he was called into action.

The Galaxy Leader capture





Israel Defense Forces (IDF) conducted successful airstrikes against ports and facilities held by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, a spokesperson of the Israeli military announced on Monday.The targets included a commercial vessel seized by the Houthis in November 2023, according to lieutenant colonel Nadav Shoshani of the IDF. The vessel was bound for India on the day of its capture.""STRUCK AND DESTROYED: Military targets belonging to the Houthi terrorist regime at the ports of Al Hudaydah, Ras Isa, Salif, and the Ras Kanatib Power Plant. These strikes were in response to repeated Houthi attacks against Israel and demonstrate the regime’s systematic use of civilian infrastructure for terrorism,"" Shoshani posted on X.At Ras Isa, the Israeli military destroyed the Galaxy Leader vessel, he noted, adding that the Houthis had installed a radar system on the ship to track vessels and facilitate ""terrorist activity.""Another key facility destroyed was the Ras Kanatib power plant, a significant electricity source for Yemen's rebels.""These ports are used to transfer Iranian weapons, which the Houthis employ in terrorist operations against Israel and its allies,"" Shoshani wrote.The IDF strikes came after Sunday's attack in the Red Sea on a Liberian-flagged ship, which caught fire and took on water, later forcing its crew to abandon the vessel.Suspicion for the attack on the Greek-owned bulk carrier Magic Seas immediately fell on the Houthis, particularly as a security firm said it appeared bomb-carrying drone boats hit the ship after it was targeted by small arms and rocket-propelled grenades.The rebels’ media reported on the attack but did not claim it.The Houthis seized the ship on November 19, 2023, as they began a campaign in the Red Sea against vessels which they claimed were linked to Israel, following Hamas’s October 7 massacre in the Jewish State, and the subsequent war in Gaza.Following its capture, a spokesperson of Yemen's rebel group declared that it would target all ships owned or operated by Israeli companies or carrying the Israeli flag.The Bahamas-flagged Galaxy Leader was not directly owned or operated by Israelis, but leased to a Japanese firm from a British company partly owned by an Israeli national.On the day of its capture, the cargo ship had left a port in Turkey and headed for India. On board were 25 crew members of different nationalities, including Ukrainians, Bulgarians, Filipinos, and Mexicans.The crew members were released only in January this year, and allowed to leave for Oman.","The targets included a commercial vessel seized by the Houthis in November 2023.

Is Xi planning power transition or retirement?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/is-xi-planning-power-transition-or-retirement/articleshow/122286834.cms,"



BEIJING: Chinese President Xi Jinping , widely regarded as a president for life, is beginning to delegate authority to key organs of the ruling Communist Party, a first in his over 12-year rule. Xi's move sparked speculation that he may be laying the groundwork for an orderly power transition or scaling back his role in preparation for possible retirement.Speculation about Xi's power transition was rife after state-run Xinhua news agency recently reported that the powerful 24-member Political Bureau of the ruling Communist Party of China in its meeting on Jun 30 reviewed a set of new regulations on the work of the party's institutions.The meeting presided over by Xi himself stressed that the regulations will further standardise the establishment, responsibilities, and operations of the CPC Central Committee's decision-making, deliberative, and coordinating institutions. Such institutions should exercise more effective leadership and coordination over major tasks and focus on planning, discussing, and overseeing major tasks, the Xinhua report said.While the overseas Chinese dissident community in recent months was abuzz with speculation of a power struggle within the secretive and tightly controlled CPC, a China-based political analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity said the regulations on these party bodies could hint at preparations for Xi's retirement.""The rules may be set up to regulate the bodies because it's a key time for power transition,"" the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post on Sunday quoted the analyst as saying. Other experts, however, averred that Xi, regarded as the most powerful leader after CPC founder Mao Zedong, may be delegating some powers to focus on larger issues.Analysts say his plan to remain in power or share power was expected to unravel before or during the next five-year congress of the CPC to be held in 2027, by which time his third term will end.""It does seem that Xi might pay less attention to day-to-day details, which necessitates a policing mechanism to ensure that his policy priorities are still being carried out by lower-level officials,"" Victor Shih, a specialist in Chinese elite politics and finance at the University of California San Diego, told the Post.Xi also skipped the Brics summit being held in Rio de Janeiro from Sunday. This is the first time since he became president that he will be missing the summit of the emerging economies. Xi's move of delegating power comes amid US President Trump's tariff war disrupting China's $440 billion exports to America, besides major headwinds faced by the Chinese economy, with growth falling due to continued slowdown, and the collapse of the housing market, the mainstay of the economic growth.Since he took over power, becoming the general secretary of the CPC in 2012, Xi, rapidly consolidated his power hold in the key power centres - the party, the presidency, and the powerful military as the chairman of the Central Military Commission. As he firmed up his grip over power structures, carrying out China's biggest anti-corruption campaign in which over a million officials were punished and dozens of top generals purged, Xi was declared as ""core leader"" of the party, a designation that was conferred only on party founder Zedong. Later, the key rule of the president's term of two five-year terms was amended by the legislature, paving the way for him to get elected for an unprecedented third five-year term as president of the country in the following year. All of Xi's predecessors retired after two five-year terms, while he continued in power with no term limits, earning him the label of president for life.","Chinese President Xi Jinping is beginning to delegate authority to key organs of the ruling Communist Party, a first in his over 12-year rule.

JERUSALEM: Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu said he believed his discussions with US President Trump on Monday would help advance talks on a Gaza hostage release and ceasefire deal that Israeli negotiators resumed in Qatar on Sunday.Israeli negotiators taking part in the talks have clear instructions to achieve a ceasefire agreement under conditions that Israel has accepted, Netanyahu said Sunday before boarding his flight to Washington.""I believe the discussion with President Trump can certainly help advance these results,"" he said, adding he was determined to ensure the return of hostages and to remove the threat of Hamas to Israel. It will be Netanyahu's third visit to White House since Trump returned to office in Jan.Public pressure is mounting on Netanyahu to secure a permanent ceasefire and end the war in Gaza, a move opposed by some hardliners in his coalition. Others, including foreign minister Gideon Saar, have expressed support. Palestinian militant group Hamas said Friday it had responded to a US-backed truce proposal in a ""positive spirit"", a few days after Trump said Israel had agreed ""to the necessary conditions to finalise"" a 60-day truce.But in a sign of the potential challenges, a member of a militant group allied with Hamas said concerns remained over humanitarian aid, passage through Rafah crossing in southern Israel to Egypt and clarity over a timetable for Israeli troop withdrawals. Netanyahu's office said changes sought by Hamas to the truce proposal were ""not acceptable to Israel"". His office said the delegation would still fly to Qatar to ""continue efforts to secure the return of our hostages based on the Qatari proposal that Israel agreed to"". Netanyahu has repeatedly said Hamas must be disarmed, a demand the group has so far refused to discuss.",Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu said he believed his discussions with US President Trump on Monday would help advance talks on a Gaza hostage release and ceasefire deal.

Musk says will start a new political party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/musk-says-will-start-a-new-political-party/articleshow/122286793.cms,"



Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and the country's biggest political donor, said on Saturday that he would create a new political party, an enormous and challenging undertaking that would test the billionaire's newfound influence on American politics. ""When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,"" Musk wrote Saturday on X, his social media website. ""Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.""Musk, once a close ally of President Trump's who in recent weeks has repeatedly bickered with him, had not filed paperwork as of Saturday evening for the new party, though he added in a separate post that the America Party would be active in elections ""next year."" No immediate signs suggested that Musk was working to establish his party quickly. Any new entity would be required to be disclosed to the Federal Election Commission.Musk has spoken with friends in recent days about his plan for a political party and what it would take to accomplish it, according to a person briefed on those conversations. The discussions have been more conceptual than pragmatic, the person said.Even as Musk has proved that he is willing to use his resources to move quickly and dramatically, he also has a long history of not following through on promises.Musk, who helped slash govt programmes and funding by leading the DOGE before publicly feuding with Trump, had grown incensed by the president's sweeping domestic policy bill. Last month, on social media, he called it a ""disgusting abomination,"" adding that it would ""massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit"" and that ""Congress is making America bankrupt."" For weeks, Musk teased he would start a new political party if the legislation passed, but he had not explicitly stated his intention to do so until Saturday.The two-party system has been a defining feature of modern American politics, and plenty of moderate billionaires have dreamed of a successful third-party effort. But the barriers to creating a new, influential political party are plentiful, including heavily gerrymandered districts, deep political polarisation and onerous state laws.Musk donated nearly $300 million to Republican candidates in the 2024 election. On Friday, Musk wrote on X that an initial approach could be to back America Party candidates in just two or three Senate races and between eight and 10 congressional races in next year's midterm elections. He reiterated a version of that plan Saturday.","Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person, says he will create a new political party. The America Party would be active in elections ""next year,"" he says. Musk has not yet filed paperwork for the new party. He is the country's biggest political donor and a former ally of President Trump.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122286800,imgsize-652032,width-400,resizemode-4/122286800.jpg"

A day after asking his followers on X about forming a new political party in the US, Elon Musk announced on Saturday that the ""America Party"" has been established.""Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.""Elon Musk’s announcement comes shortly after President Donald Trump signed a tax-cut and spending bill into law on Friday, a move the Tesla CEO strongly opposed.The new political party that Musk has pledged, may begin by targeting a select number of winnable House and Senate seats, aiming to hold the balance of power on key issues given the narrow margins in Congress.In a post following his poll Musk said, “One way to execute on this would be to laser-focus on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts,” who played a central role in federal budget cuts after Donald Trump’s second term began in January.“Given the razor-thin legislative margins, that would be enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws, ensuring they serve the true will of the people.”Though, he didn’t specify which seats he may be eyeing.The spending bill passed the House by a narrow 218-214 margin, with only two Republicans siding with Democrats, who were ultimately unable to block it. In the Senate, a 50-50 tie was broken by Vice-President JD Vance, allowing the bill to pass just hours before Donald Trump signed it into law.The razor-thin margins in both chambers highlight how just a handful of seats could swing critical legislative outcomes, an opening Elon Musk appears to be targeting with his newly announced party.On Friday, as the US marked its 249th Independence Day, Elon Musk posted a poll on X asking followers whether he should move forward with his earlier proposal to launch the America Party as an alternative to both Republicans and Democrats. By Saturday morning, over 1.25 million users had responded, with more than 65% voting in favor of the idea.“Independence Day is the perfect time to ask if you want independence from the two-party (some would say uniparty) system!,” Musk added in the post.","Elon Musk announced on Saturday that the ""America Party"" has been established.

US deports 8 migrants to South Sudan: Legal challenges overruled by supreme court; critics call move unconstitutional,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-deports-8-migrants-to-south-sudan-legal-challenges-overruled-by-supreme-court-critics-call-move-unconstitutional/articleshow/122272686.cms,"US President Donald Trump (AP)





The Trump administration has deported eight migrants to South Sudan, a US department of homeland security official confirmed, after plans to initially send them to a base in Djibouti were called off.""A district judge cannot dictate the national security and foreign policy of the United States of America,"" assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told ABC News. ""This Independence Day marks another victory for the safety and security of the American people.""The aircraft arrived in South Sudan shortly before midnight on Friday.The eight migrants, whom the department of homeland security alleges have serious criminal convictions, were previously involved in a lawsuit that temporarily halted their deportation to South Sudan, redirecting them instead to a US military base in Djibouti.According to court filings, conditions at the US military base in Djibouti were difficult for both the detainees and the ICE officials assigned to guard them.The case reached the US supreme court, which ruled in a 7-2 decision on Thursday that the Trump administration was not obligated to comply with a lower court order requiring the migrants to remain at the military facility while legal proceedings continued.The ruling marked another legal victory for the Trump administration in its ongoing effort to deport individuals to countries with which they have no direct ties, and where they could potentially face mistreatment.In an unsigned opinion, the US supreme court stated that, following its recent decision to remove judge-imposed due process requirements for third-country deportations, the government can no longer be held accountable for allegedly violating those protections.One of the attorneys representing the group of men described their deportation to South Sudan as “punitive and unconstitutional.”“Because of the supreme court's procedural ruling, these men were denied an opportunity to contest their deportations to South Sudan based on their fear of torture or death,” said Trina Realmuto in a statement to ABC News. “The US state department warns Americans against all travel to South Sudan, yet deported these men there without any due process. Make no mistake about it, these deportations were punitive and unconstitutional. ”",Eight migrants have been deported to South Sudan.

Two people died in Burnet County while another died in Tom Green County.Earlier, authorities had reported that 27 girls from a Christian summer camp located along the Guadalupe River were among the missing. Officials believe some of the campers may be stranded and unable to reach out for help.A US Congressman has confirmed that his two daughters were safely evacuated from Camp Mystic, the summer camp for girls.Representative August Pfluger announced on Saturday via a post on X that he and his wife have been “now reunited” with their daughters.“The last day has brought unimaginable grief to many families and we mourn with them as well as holding out hope for survivors,” he wrote.“Please join us today as we pray for miracles,” he added.At a news conference on Friday night, Texas Governor Greg Abbott stated that the state is deploying all necessary resources to support ongoing search and rescue operations.

In the meantime, both sides are working toward an interim trade deal. India has set firm boundaries on sensitive areas such as agriculture and dairy as negotiations over the interim trade pact with the US move forward.Earlier this year, Trump had threatened Brics nations, including India, of imposing 100% tariffs on trade in case the bloc moved forward with plans to replace the US dollar.

Which places are the worst affected?



Heavy rain at wrong time in a flood-prone place



Alerts sounded, but catastrophe followed







At least 82 killed, and countless July Fourth visitors and campers missing, as flash floods wreak havoc in Texas. US President Donald Trump called it a ""100-year catastrophe"" and said that he would visit the flood-hit areas ""probably on Friday. """"This is 100-year catastrophe, and it's just so horrible to watch,"" Trump said, adding that he would visit ""probably on Friday.""Rescuers in Texas scrambled on Sunday to locate dozens of missing people, including children.

Many remain missing, including 10 girls and a counselor from Camp Mystic in Hunt.In Travis County, six people died as floodwaters destroyed homes and vehicles. About 50 people were rescued, and officials shifted from emergency response to recovery, though flood watches continued.Burnet County reported three deaths and five missing. Two deaths each were confirmed in Kendall and Williamson counties, and one in Tom Green County, where a woman was found outside her submerged car in San Angelo.The flash floods in Texas struck at the height of the long holiday weekend, catching many people as they slept. The disaster unfolded in the Texas Hill Country, a region especially vulnerable to flash floods because its dry, compacted soil causes rainwater to race across the surface rather than being absorbed. A powerful overnight storm unleashed nearly 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain early Friday morning, setting the stage for devastation.Also read: ‘Not going to make it’: Father of 2 dies in Texas flood while saving family; almost cut his arm ‘clean off’ Authorities had issued a flood watch on Thursday, but by 4am Friday (local time) the National Weather Service escalated it to a dire warning, citing catastrophic risks to life and property. Within little more than an hour, residents of Kerrville City saw water levels surge alarmingly, as runoff from the hills sent torrents into the Guadalupe River. The river rose an astonishing 26 feet (8 meters) in just 45 minutes, overwhelming the region.The National Weather Service began issuing flood advisories on Thursday, escalating to flash flood warnings overnight and ultimately declaring rare flash flood emergencies as the danger became imminent. At Mo-Ranch Camp in Hunt, officials moved hundreds of campers and church youth conference attendees to higher ground as a precaution. Nearby camps, Rio Vista and Sierra Vista, also kept a close watch on conditions, having just wrapped up their second summer session on Thursday.Despite these measures, officials admitted they hadn’t anticipated rainfall of such intensity — a downpour equivalent to several months’ worth of rain.

It is a Great Bill but, unfortunately for Elon, it eliminates the ridiculous Electric Vehicle (EV) Mandate, which would have forced everyone to buy an Electric Car in a short period of time.

Speaking on CNN's State of the Union, Bessent said Elon Musk was not actually popular, the principles of DOGE were popular.“I believe that the boards of directors at his various companies wanted him to come back and run those companies,” Bessent said Sunday. “So, I imagine that those board of directors did not like this announcement yesterday and will be encouraging him to focus on his business activities, not his political activities.”Former DOGE adviser James Fishback wrote to Tesla Board and announced that his investment firm decided to postpone public listing of Azoria Tesla Convexity EFT after Elon Musk announced launching a new political party.""In May, when Elon stepped back from his work at DOGE and returned his attention to Tesla, we were encouraged.

As Elon Musk can't contest for presidential election as he was not born in the US, conspiracy theorists worked overtime to find out possible disruptors who could join Elon Musk's America Party and lead it.

Social media users said none of the names associated with the America Party are American.While Elon Musk was born in South Africa, Taneja was born in India and though they are US citizens, they are not natural-born US citizens.While it became a laughing stock on social media, another Indian-origin techie and investor, who goes by the name Sidharth on X announced that he is also an official member of the American Party.""Are there any actual Americans in the ""American"" party?"" he was asked.""yes they are just not racist towards fellow Americans,"" Sidharth wrote, adding that he is an American who employs more fellow Americans. Calling himself the ""American dream"", Sidharth said the ""xenophobic"" attack on Indian Americans will backfire spectacularly.""The xenophobic attacks against Indian Americans simply for existing and voicing their opinions will backfire spectacularly.Everyone involved in this malicious framing of ‘The America Party’ will have to deal with the severe consequences of their actions,"" Sidharth wrote.The Indian-origin investor observed that Indian-Americans are not even allowed dual citizenship unlike the Americans of European origin but their loyalty always gets questioned.""Over 50% of Americans of European origin hold dual citizenship, meaning their loyalty is split between the U.S. and another country. Meanwhile, Indian Americans are not even allowed dual citizenship and yet they remain some of the most loyal, law abiding, and committed Americans you’ll ever meet. Let that sink in,"" he wrote.","Elon Musk announced he would be launching a party for Americans following his fallout with President Donald Trump.

Katie Miller resurfaces with both her husband and Elon Musk separately amid divorce rumors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/katie-miller-resurfaces-with-both-her-husband-and-elon-musk-separately-amid-divorce-rumors/articleshow/122282423.cms,"Katie Miller clarifies she is with Stephen Miller in her personal relationship and with Elon Musk in her professional commitment.





Katie Miller, the former White House staff, who walked out of the Donald Trump administration to work for Elon Musk amid rumors that she was getting separated from husband Stephen Miller, a key ally of President Donald Trump, resurfaced this week.On July 4, Katie Miller posted a photo with Stephen but before that she emerged as a signature to emails sent to reporters from Elon Musk's xAI. According to reports, the email announced that xAI, the artificial intelligence of Elon Musk's X, received the permit to use gas-powered turbines at a data center.Fortune reported that sending such a mail was not only unusual but also very rare for xAI as it rarely engaged with the media.Katie Miller and Stephen Miller were at the centre of everyone's curiosity as Stephen remained loyal to President Trump as his deputy chief of staff while Katie went to work with Elon Musk full time -- as Trump and Musk fought. There was a temporary lull in their fight as Musk apologized for some comments that he made about Trump, but their relationship was far from getting repaired. With Donald Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill' getting passed ahead of June 4, Elon Musk kept his promise of starting a new political party: America Party.The Millers were very close to Musk as it was reported that the three used to hang out together in and around Washington even beyond the requirement of their work. As Katie Miller chose to work with Elon Musk, there were rumors that Katie was in a relationship with Musk and would divorce Stephen Miller soon.With her July 4 photo, Katie Miller sent a message to the rumor mills that she is in her marriage with Stephen Miller and her work commitment remains with Elon Musk.To defend Elon Musk, Katie Miller shut down James Fishback on social media after Fishback, who was known to be a former DOGE adviser, expressed disappointment with Elon's new political endeavor.""I respected Elon. I advised DOGE. My firm's largest positions is in Tesla,"" Fishback who also wrote to Tesla Board posted on X. ""You didn't advise DOGE,"" Katie Miller rebukes him though Fishback officially was a DOGE adviser.","Katie Miller, the former White House staff, walked out of the Donald Trump administration to work for Elon Musk amid rumors that she was getting separated from husband Stephen Miller.

But when it comes to politics, he’s dead wrong on this.” Fishback resigned from DOGE last month after Musk lashed out at Trump.Fishback, who is represented by Lex Politica, the same firm that represents Musk and his SuperPAC AmericaPAC, is putting $1 million of his own money into his PAC, the Politico report said.",Former DOGE adviser James Fishback wrote to the Tesla Board urging them to ask Elon Musk to clarify his political ambitions.

Musk’s America Party aims for “Freedom”







MAGA commentator and Trump ally Laura Loomer on Sunday suggested that some prominent conservatives could soon align with Elon Musk’s newly launched America Party.Loomer named three prominent figures she believes are poised to align with Musk: former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Representative Thomas Massie.In a post on X, Loomer said: ""I predict Tucker Carlson, MTG, and Thomas Massie will join the new 'America Party' to spite President Trump.""Loomer pointed to the former Fox News commentator but said Carlson isn’t a “true Trump supporter.” Despite that, she predicted he would sign on with Musk’s America Party as a way to “spite President Trump.” Carlson recently criticised Republicans for producing “weak” policy positions.Georgia Representative Greene has already publicly sided with Musk over Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.” Loomer said this makes her a prime candidate to join Musk’s party. Greene used her platform to praise Musk for confronting Trump on fiscal discipline, noting her dissatisfaction with Congress’s spending.Loomer signalled that Musk-backed Congressman Massie, who voted against Trump’s signature tax-and-spend package, would follow suit with the America Party.Trump has previously criticised Massie, but Loomer highlighted his stance against the bill—saying he had “enough” Republicans to resist it—as evidence of his willingness to break with Trump on principle.Elon Musk officially launched the America Party on July 5, declaring that it was created to “give you back your freedom.” The move came after growing tensions with Donald Trump over a recent federal spending bill, which Musk opposed. The party says it will apply “extremely concentrated force” to influence key Senate and House races. Its focus will be on budget cuts, deregulation, and tech-focused policies. Though its national reach is still limited, political observers say the America Party could reshape close races in swing districts. Musk’s new party is already drawing attention from frustrated conservatives, libertarians, and some in the MAGA movement who no longer align fully with Trump.","Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Representative Thomas Massie could align with Elon Musk’s America Party.

Pakistan's power struggle narrows to two men: Imran vs Munir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-power-struggle-narrows-to-two-men-imran-vs-munir/articleshow/122283924.cms,"Imran Khan and Asim Munir (R)





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political battlefield has narrowed to two poles: Field Marshal Asim Munir , the army chief whose influence spans parliament, the judiciary and diplomacy, and Imran Khan , the jailed former prime minister who, despite his incarceration in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, remains the most potent political force in the country, commanding the street, the diaspora, and a digital army keeping his voice alive.This week, Khan issued a call for nationwide agitation after the 10th of Muharram, aiming to reignite mass mobilisation just as Field Marshal Munir stands at the peak of his institutional authority. The move comes amid growing public frustration over inflation, repression, and a system many believe has been engineered to exclude the electorate’s will.Two weeks ago, Munir met US President Donald Trump at the White House, a discreet engagement confirmed by diplomatic sources. According to insiders, Imran Khan’s fate and Pakistan’s internal political stability were among the topics discussed, particularly in light of pressure from the overseas Pakistani diaspora.Soon after, the Supreme Court awarded the PTI’s reserved seats to the ruling PML-N-PPP coalition, handing it a two-thirds supermajority in parliament — a legal outcome that critics say has effectively nullified the popular mandate from the Feb 2024 general elections.“It’s political elimination through judicial procedure,” said a senior legal analyst. “The system was rewritten to fit the result.”While Munir tours Washington, Riyadh and Beijing as Pakistan’s stabilising envoy, PTI’s political campaign has been pushed abroad, led by a vast online network of digital volunteers across the UK, North America and the Gulf. “You can erase a party from parliament, but not from memory,” said a PTI organiser in Birmingham. “We’ve made the diaspora the movement’s backbone.”PTI’s message – injustice, censorship, stolen mandate – is kept alive through platforms like YouTube, Telegram and X, forming a digital frontline that defies state control.Munir’s rising global stature – reinforced by high-profile diplomatic engagements – may yet prove to be a deceptive calm. History offers a cautionary echo: Pakistan’s military rulers from Ayub to Zia to Musharraf all basked in international legitimacy at their zeniths, only to be brought down by domestic discontent.With Khan’s post-Muharram agitation call threatening to spill onto the streets and economic despair combining with political anger, Munir’s firm grip on the state may soon face its first real stress test. What looks like consolidation could quickly unravel if the tide of public rage surpasses the system’s capacity to contain it.There is no serious civilian counterweight. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif holds office but not authority. The real contest is between Munir with unmatched institutional control, and Imran, the politician with unbroken public appeal.Field Marshal Munir may rule the state. But Imran Khan – even from a prison cell – continues to shape the struggle that could decide Pakistan’s political future.","Imran Khan remains the most potent political force in the country.

Pakistan building collapse: 27 dead in Karachi including 3 children; rescue efforts continue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-building-collapse-27-dead-in-karachi-including-3-children-rescue-efforts-continue/articleshow/122281154.cms,"



The death toll from the collapse of a five-storey residential building in Karachi’s Lyari area has risen to 27, according to officials quoted by Dawn on Sunday.Rescue teams continue to comb through the debris in search of survivors, days after the structure came crashing down near Lea Market on Fida Husain Shaikha Road.South deputy commissioner Javed Nabi Khoso said the rescue operation had continued overnight on Friday and was around 80 per cent complete by Saturday. Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan estimated that it would take another five to six hours to fully conclude the operation.Several individuals are still unaccounted for, though authorities say the exact number remains unclear as the search is ongoing.The Edhi Rescue Service confirmed that 27 bodies have been recovered so far, including nine women, 15 men and three children aged 13, 10 and one. Five people, among them three women, were also injured in the collapse. All victims were taken to Civil Hospital Karachi, and ten of the injured have since been treated and discharged.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said emergency teams were deployed swiftly after the incident and that the bodies have been returned to the victims’ families.He reaffirmed expectations that rescue efforts would conclude later in the day.Shah announced that a full investigation is underway, with committees already formed to examine the causes of the collapse. He revealed that over 480 buildings in Karachi’s older city areas, mostly in District South, have been declared dangerous.He also pledged government support for those displaced by the incident, promising assistance in securing alternative housing.The chief minister said the collapsed building appeared to be newly constructed and lacked the necessary approvals. He warned of strict action against those responsible for unauthorised construction and urged residents to confirm the clearance of buildings with the Building Control Authority before purchasing or renting.Acknowledging that financial struggles often force people into unsafe living conditions, Shah stressed the need for stronger enforcement and public awareness to ensure safety is not compromised.","The death toll from the collapse of a five-storey residential building in Karachi’s Lyari area has risen to 27.

KARACHI: The death toll from a collapsed multi-story residential building in southern Pakistan rose to 16 as search operations to find survivors continued for the second day.Rescuers pulled 10 more bodies from the rubble during an overnight operation, officials said Saturday.The govt-run Civil Hospital said in a statement it had received the 16 bodies, adding several of the injured had been hospitalised. Rescue workers are using heavy machinery to search for at least eight more survivors believed to be trapped under the debris, said emergency officials.Residents said the building was located on a narrow street, hampering efforts to bring in additional heavy equipment. Television footage showed rescuers removing debris as relatives of those still trapped cried and prayed for the safety of their loved ones.Building collapses are common in Pakistan, where construction standards are often poorly enforced. Many structures are built with substandard materials, and safety regulations are frequently ignored to cut costs.

Rescue teams in Pakistan continued to search for survivors on Saturday after a six-storey residential building collapsed in Karachi's Lyari neighbourhood, killing 16 people and injuring 13 others, according to local officials.The building came down around 10am on Friday in the Baghdadi area of Lyari, a densely populated and impoverished part of the city. Residents said they heard cracking sounds shortly before the collapse. Rescue workers, battling high heat and humidity, have been working through the night. At least eight people are still believed to be trapped under the debris.Summiaya Syed, a police surgeon with the provincial health department, confirmed the death toll at 16 and said 13 others had been injured.Dev Raj, 54, told AFP his daughter was still under the rubble. ""She was my beloved daughter. She was so sensitive, but is under the burden of debris. She got married just six months ago,"" he said.Another resident, Jumho Maheshwari, said his entire family of six was trapped inside their first-floor apartment. ""Nothing is left for me now,"" he said.Maya Sham Jee, whose brother's family is still missing, called it a tragedy.""We are helpless and just looking at the rescue workers to bring our loved ones back safely.""Authorities said the building had been declared unsafe and that eviction notices were sent out in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Javed Nabi Khoso, a senior district government official, said, ""We don't want to impose our orders by force. We work in phases and send them notices to leave the building. They didn't take the notices seriously.""The building had long been declared ""dangerous"" by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), which claimed that repeated eviction notices had been issued, according to ARY News.Locals, however, disputed the SBCA's claims, alleging that no such formal warnings were communicated.Commissioner Karachi Hassan Naqvi, who visited the site after 13 hours, laid blame on residents who continued living in unsafe structures.SBCA data reveals that Karachi currently has 578 buildings marked as unsafe, with District South holding the highest number of structurally compromised structures.Officials also confirmed that an adjacent building to the one that collapsed has suffered structural damage and is now under observation.However, Imran Khaskheli, a building owner and resident, denied receiving any notice. ""Do you think we are out of our senses to stay in an unsafe building with our families?"" he asked. He said he noticed cracks in the pillars early Friday and warned families to evacuate. ""Many did not heed my warning,"" he said, adding that about 40 families lived in the building.Shankar Kamho, 30, said his wife called him when she noticed the cracks. ""I told her to get out immediately,"" he said. His wife warned the neighbours, but one woman reportedly replied, ""This building will stand for at least 10 more years"". Still, his wife and daughter left in time, just 20 minutes before the collapse.According to officials, more than 50 buildings in the district have been declared unsafe.
