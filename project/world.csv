BLA labelled foreign terrorist org as Trump plans to develop Pakistan's 'huge oil reserves',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bla-labelled-foreign-terrorist-org-as-trump-plans-to-develop-pakistans-huge-oil-reserves/articleshow/123293102.cms,"Despite being designated as Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) in 2019, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) surprisingly evaded being labelled as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) until now. However, the US state department's sudden interest in the rebel group, particularly its subsidiary Majeed Brigade, has raised eyebrows and sparked curiosity about possible motivations.The development comes close on the heels of US President Donald Trump announcing his plans to develop 'massive oil reserves' with Pakistan. The announcement attracted a response from Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch, who said that reserves of oil, natural gas, copper, lithium, uranium and rare earths were not located in actual Pakistan and belonged to ""Republic of Balochistan"". Baloch wrote an open letter to Trump warning him that he was misled about ""massive oil reserves"" in Pakistan by army chief Asim Munir.The visits to Pakistan by Gentry Beach, a close college friend of President Trump's son Donald Trump Jr, have also piqued curiosity, with the latter seeing a potential to cut deals worth billions of dollars in explorations of rare earth minerals, oil and gas, and real estate. A recent deal that Pakistan negotiated with World Liberty Financial (WLF), a cryptocurrency venture in which the Trump family has a 60% stake, has also fuelled speculation.Though it had its roots founded in the 70s, the Majeed Brigade was a little-known entity until a decade ago. The brigade comprises fidayeen (suicide bombers) who have been fighting the Pakistan-China collaboration opposed to its freedom struggle. ""It was in the 1970s that Abdul Majeed Baloch carried out a failed assassination bid on Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the former Pakistan PM who dismissed the National Awami Party's govt in Balochistan,"" recalled a source.However, it was in 2010-11 that the brigade was formally constituted in the memory of Abdul Majeed. Since then, the brigade has carried out numerous suicide attacks against Pakistani security forces and Chinese nationals working for China-Pakistan Economic Corridor projects in Balochistan and Sindh. The attacks have intensified since 2018. Their most lethal hit was on the Jaffar Express, in which BLA claimed it eliminated 214 Pak military personnel.","The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) surprisingly evaded being labelled as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) until now.

Orca ATTACK VIDEO: After Jessica Radcliffe, Kayaker’s Unexpected Sea Encounter Goes Viral

Actual orca attacks, genuine tragedies







A video that is now going viral on social media shows a marine trainer named Jessica Radcliffe allegedly being attacked and killed by an orca, sparking widespread concerns. The footage seems to capture a violent incident at a marine park during a live show.Fact-checking investigations have since confirmed that such an event never took place, and there are no official records, news reports, or credible sources confirming the existence of Jessica Radcliffe or the alleged attack.Experts quoted by IB Times say that the clip itself is AI-generated, highlighting how quickly misinformation can spread and the challenges faced while debunking false information once it gains momentum.The clip’s central claim is that Radcliffe was attacked by an Orca during a live show. However, fact-checkers from sources like Vocal Media found no trace of a person named Jessica Radcliffe in marine park employment records, credible news reports, or public databases.Official marine safety records showed no evidence of such an incident, reports IB Times.There are several versions of the video circulating on social media that are made in a way to amplify emotional response and improve traction.The hoax seems to draw on elements from actual incidents involving orcas and their trainers, reports IB Times.A 40-year-old trainer, Dawn Brancheau, died in 2010 after a killer whale, Tilikum, pulled her into the pool at SeaWorld, Orlando, reports CBS News.In a similar incident, Spanish trainer Alexis Martinez was also killed at a marine park located on Tenerife.What makes the video feel believable is the fact that real-life incidents involving orcas and their trainers have occurred. One of the most well-known cases is the death of senior SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau, who was killed by an orca named Tilikum during a live performance in Orlando. This tragic event later became the focus of the 2013 documentary Blackfish, which ignited widespread controversy over the ethics of keeping orcas in captivity.","A video that is now going viral on social media shows a marine trainer named Jessica Radcliffe allegedly being attacked and killed by an orca.

PM Modi 's visit to New York, if it takes place, will come at a time when the US has bumped up tariffs on New Delhi to 50 per cent for purchasing Russian crude oil, which US President Donald Trump claimed has ""fueled"" Moscow's war with Ukraine.On August 6, Trump announced an additional 25 per cent tariff on most imports from India for buying Russian oil. Coming on top of the 25 per cent tariff he already announced, the additional tariff is set to bring the taxes on goods and products India exports to the US to 50 per cent if fully implemented.rump not only doubled down on tariffs but also announced a penalty on India for purchasing Russian military equipment.The executive order signed by Trump, citing threats to US national security because of India's purchase of oil from Russia, goes into effect on August 27, providing a three-week window of opportunity to negotiate an agreement.India responded strongly to Trump's move to impose an additional 25 per cent tariff. The ministry of external affairs in a statement called the US move unfortunate and reiterated its stand that India would continue to protect its national interests.In a strongly worded statement, the MEA said, ""..it is extremely unfortunate that the US should choose to impose additional tariffs on India for actions that several other countries are also taking in their own national interest.""However, amid the tariff row, a US trade delegation is expected to visit India before August 25.Meanwhile, Trump will be meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin on August 15 in Alaska to discuss an end to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, ""The highly anticipated meeting between myself, as President of the United States of America, and President Vladimir Putin of Russia will take place next Friday, August 15, 2025, in the Great State of Alaska.""

NEW DELHI: Noting that the present adoption law is too cumbersome and frustrating for adoptive parents, the Supreme Court on Wednesday said the procedure needed to be streamlined and simplified to encourage childless couples to take the legal route to adopt rather than doing it illegally.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan, which was hearing a case on the menace of child trafficking in the country, said people take illegal routes to adopt children as the adoption process takes years. It said not having children is a social stigma and such parents ""want a child badly but the process is cumbersome"".The total number of adoptions crossed 4,500 in 2025-26 as of March 31, the highest in 11 years.However, for many prospective adoptive parents (PAPs), the process of adopting a child continues to be a challenge with an average of 3.5 years waiting period for those seeking infants and young children. The Central Adoption Resource Authority (Cara) dashboard shows there are over 36,616 PAPs across various categories registered to adopt while the number of children available for adoption is merely 2,756.""The present adoption process is taking too long.Parents want a child badly but the process is cumbersome and frustrating for them,"" SC said.It added the existing flaw in the system was reflected in a case that was decided by it a day before, in which four parents from Telangana had adopted children, but not as per the procedure laid down by law, and police thereafter took away custody. The court allowed the plea of the four adoptive parents and restored custody of the children - aged between a few months and three years - to them by invoking its extraordinary power under Article 142 of the Constitution.In this case, the petitioners had adopted the children after they came to know that their biological parents were not willing to keep them. They did not involve the authority concerned in the process and took custody of the children without informing it. But state the police took away the children after it came to know about the adoption, and the children were handed over to the Child Welfare Project Director and Integrated Child Protection Services.","The total number of adoptions crossed 4,500 in 2025-26 as of March 31, the highest in 11 years.

President Donald Trump reportedly wants his daughter, Ivanka Trump , to participate in planning and organizing an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) cage fight on the White House lawn to commemorate America’s 250th Independence anniversary next year. This comes despite her having stepped back from politics.Since Trump’s reelection for a second term last November, Ivanka has largely stayed out of the public spotlight. However, UFC CEO Dana White said the president wants her involved in the plans for the White House event.“When [Trump] called me and asked me to do it, he said, ‘I want Ivanka in the middle of this,’” White told CBS Mornings. “So Ivanka reached out to me, and her and I started talking about the possibilities, where it would be and, you know, I put together all the renderings.”Ivanka has attended multiple UFC events with her father, as reported by the Independent.White’s relationship with Trump dates back to the early 2000s, when the president hosted some of the first UFC events at his properties. White confirmed that discussions with Trump took place Monday night, and the fight is scheduled for July 4, 2026.Trump, who has attended several UFC events, said the occasion would be one of many celebrations marking the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.Ivanka’s potential involvement would mark her return to public events after a three-year break, during which she has focused on her children and husband, Jared Kushner. In 2022, she stated, “I love my father very much. This time around, I am choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family. I do not plan to be involved in politics.”Both Ivanka and Kushner played central roles in Trump’s 2016 campaign and served as presidential advisors beginning in 2017. Following the contentious 2020 election and the Capitol Hill riots, Ivanka chose not to participate in her father’s second presidential run.","Donald Trump reportedly wants his daughter, Ivanka Trump, to participate in planning and organizing an Ultimate Fighting Championship cage fight.

Wildfires rage across southern Europe | BBC News





Wildfires intensified across southern Europe on Wednesday, killing at least three people and forcing thousands to evacuate homes in Greece, Spain, Turkey and Albania.In Greece, firefighters worked through the night to protect the port city of Patras, the country’s third-largest city. Flames swept through pine forests and olive groves, burning houses, agricultural sites and dozens of vehicles. The fire service said the risk of more fires remained “very high” in several regions. At least 15 firefighters were injured or treated for burns, smoke inhalation and exhaustion.Residents joined the firefighting effort, using buckets of water and tree branches to beat down flames. Aircraft dropped water over the affected areas. Weeks of heatwaves have stretched firefighting resources across Greece and its neighbours. On the Greek island of Chios, exhausted firefighters were seen sleeping on the roadside after overnight shifts.In Albania, an 80-year-old man died in a fire south of Tirana. Villages in central Albania were evacuated, and explosions were reported in the Korca district due to buried World War II-era shells. Dozens of homes were destroyed.In Spain, a firefighting volunteer died in the Castile and Leon region, where thousands have been displaced. Some evacuees spent the night outdoors. Fires disrupted high-speed rail services between Madrid and Galicia.In Turkey, a forestry worker was killed and four others were injured when a fire truck crashed while responding to a blaze. Turkey has been battling wildfires since late June, with 18 deaths reported so far.France which is recovering from massive recent fires in the southern regions, faced another day of extreme heat, with temperatures reaching 42°C. Authorities restricted public events in high-risk areas.Officials across the region cited lightning storms, farming activities, faulty power lines and arson as possible causes.The European Union has sent ground teams and aircraft to help, including in Montenegro, where large fires continue to burn near the capital, Podgorica.","At least three people have died in wildfires in Greece, Spain, Turkey and Albania.

.





US president Donald Trump on Wednesday said that Washington’s crime rate was among the highest in the world. He claimed DC’s homicide rate was worse than in cities like Mexico City, Bogota, Islamabad and Addis Ababa, and almost ten times higher than Fallujah in Iraq.Posting on Truth Social, the US president wrote, “If DC were a state, it would have the highest homicide rate of any state in America. The violent crime rate in DC has worsened, and the murder rate has essentially doubled in just over a decade. He also alleged manipulation of crime data. ""But these are only the ‘official’ statistics released by corrupt city officials. The real numbers are many times worse. In fact, a precinct commander was just suspended for allegedly manipulating the violent crime statistics, and the DC police union likewise says the real numbers are much higher,” Trump wrote.He further alleged that the Democrat government of DC had “largely stopped investigating, arresting and prosecuting most crime,” adding that no one was arrested for shoplifting.Trump said DC residents were living in fear and had largely given up on calling the police, instead avoiding the streets after dark.He added, “DC has been under siege from thugs and killers, but now DC is back under federal control where it belongs. The White House is in charge. The military and our great police will liberate this city, scrape away the filth, and make it safe, clean, habitable and beautiful once more!”Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Trump announced that the Metropolitan Police Department would now be under federal authority, with the National Guard deployed to restore order. He said the aim was to make the capital “safe, clean, habitable and beautiful” again.","US president Donald Trump on Wednesday said that Washington’s crime rate was among the highest in the world.

A school bus with over 40 children and one adult aboard overturned in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday, the first day of the new school year, injuring 12, as per officials, reported ABC News.The bus was transporting students from Leander Independent School District in northwest Austin, located in Travis County.Out of the 12 people taken to a local hospital from the scene, one person suffered life-threatening injuries and two others were critically injured, Austin-Travis County authorities reported at a Wednesday evening press conference.The rest, who suffered non-life-threatening injuries, were brought to a reunification center for evaluation and to be reunited with their families.The rollover happened after school but before any students were dropped off, as per Bruce Gearing, the superintendent of the Leander Independent School District, reported NBC News.The driver was an experienced veteran and noted that the bus mainly serves students from a local elementary school, Gearing said. He added that it remains unclear how many students were wearing seatbelts at the time of the rollover.“This part of our Leander ISD family has been through so much already this summer with the floods and this tragedy this afternoon is really breaking our hearts,” said Gearing, reported NBC News.“We want each of those students and their families to know that our prayers are with them, our thoughts are with them, and we will do everything that we can in our power to support them,” he added.It is still unclear why the 2024 model bus equipped with seatbelts veered off the right side of the road before overturning, as per an official from the Texas Department of Public Safety.The official pointed out a slight curve in the roadway and said a preliminary investigation is underway.","A school bus with over 40 children and one adult overturned in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday, the first day of the new school year.

A Hindu temple in the United States has been vandalised, prompting condemnation from the Indian Consulate in Chicago. In a post on X, the consulate described the desecration of the main signboard of the BAPS Swaminarayan Temple in Greenwood, Indiana, as “reprehensible” and confirmed it had raised the matter with law enforcement for prompt action. The Consul General met devotees, local leaders and the Mayor of Greenwood, urging unity, solidarity and vigilance against “miscreants”.The incident comes less than 6 months after a similar act of vandalism at the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Chino Hills, California. At the time, ministry of external affairs condemned the act “in the strongest terms” and urged local authorities to act swiftly and ensure security at places of worship. BAPS Public Affairs said the Hindu community would “stand steadfast against hate” and “never let hate take root”.The Coalition of Hindus of North America also linked such incidents to rising hostility towards Hindus, noting the timing ahead of a planned “Khalistan referendum” in Los Angeles. Previous attacks on BAPS temples were reported in Sacramento and New York last year, fuelling concerns over repeated targeting of Hindu places of worship across the US.","Vandalism at BAPS Swaminarayan Temple in Indiana described as'reprehensible' Indian Consul General met devotees, local leaders and the Mayor of Greenwood, urging unity, solidarity and vigilance against'miscreants' Incident comes less than 6 months after a similar act of vandalism at the BAPS Shri Swaminrayan Mandir in California.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123275239,imgsize-985007,width-400,resizemode-4/123275239.jpg"

A New Zealand woman held at a US immigration center with her six-year-old son after being detained while crossing the Canada-US border is being “treated like a criminal,” said her friend and advocate, reported the Guardian.Sarah Shaw, 33, a New Zealander who has lived in Washington state for just over three years, dropped her two older children at Vancouver Airport on July 24 for them to take a direct flight to New Zealand to visit their grandparents.When she tried to re-enter US, the immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) detained her and her youngest son in what her friend Victoria Besancon described as a “terrifying” ordeal.“Sarah thought she was being kidnapped,” Besancon said, as quoted by the Guardian. “They didn’t really explain anything to her at first; they just kind of quietly took her and her son and immediately put them in like an unmarked white van.”Her phone was then confiscated, and she was transported to the Dilley immigration processing center in South Texas.Shaw is currently applying for a green card under a provision for domestic violence survivors. According to the GoFundMe page organised by Besancon, Shaw had work authorisation but had not yet received travel permission under what's known as a “combo card,” although her son had such permission.“It wasn’t until she tried to come back across the border that she realised only half of the combination card, because it’s only one physical card, had been fully approved,” Bescanson said.Meanwhile, all three of Shaw’s children have their I-360 visas approved, and Bescanson claimed that Sarah’s youngest son was therefore being held “illegally.”Minda Thorward, Shaw’s attorney, said that under the previous administrations, customs and border protection (CBP) would likely have quickly paroled her back into the country, but that approach has changed under Trump, reported NBC King 5 News.Shaw, who works for the Washington state department of children, youth, and families (DCYF), was preparing to start graduate school soon, as per the GoFundMe page.The fund, which raised over $33,000 by Monday morning, aims to cover legal fees and basic needs after Shaw depleted her savings on legal representation, reported Newsweek.“She gives therapy and counselling to some of our most at-risk youth … and to be treated like a criminal herself has just been absolutely devastating,” Bescanson said as quoted by the Guardian.Several legal US residents have been detained by ICE in the past months. While some detainees reportedly have criminal histories that might justify visa revocation, others argue that errors in paperwork led to their detention and believe they should be released.New Zealand’s foreign affairs ministry has confirmed that they are in contact with Shaw but provided no further details due to privacy concerns, reported The Guardian.","Sarah Shaw, 33, a New Zealander who has lived in Washington state for just over three years, dropped her two older children at Vancouver Airport on July 24 for them to take a direct flight to New Zealand.

BIG! Putin To Meet Zelensky? Trump Vows 3-Way Meeting Without Asking After Warning On ‘Russia Bluff’





A divided US federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday that the Trump administration can proceed with billions of dollars in cuts to foreign assistance programs.In a 2-1 decision, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned a lower court ruling that would have required the restoration of aid funds approved by Congress.After returning to office in January, President Trump froze billions in foreign aid spending and began winding down the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the main federal agency responsible for distributing humanitarian assistance with health and emergency programs in about 120 countries.Earlier this year, District Judge Amir Ali, appointed by former President Joe Biden , issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the Trump administration from suspending the foreign aid funds approved by Congress for fiscal year 2024.The appeals court reversed that decision, ruling that the grant recipients who sued did not have the legal right to bring the case.

Kennedy Center Honors recipients 2025: From George Strait to Michael Crawford,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kennedy-center-honors-recipients-2025-from-george-strait-to-michael-crawford-who-will-be-awarded-by-trump/articleshow/123286261.cms,"George Strait (left) and Michael Crawford (right) (AP images)





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday has named the first batch of Kennedy Center Honors recipients under his leadership as the center’s chairman. The list includes country music star George Strait, “Rocky” actor Sylvester Stallone, singer Gloria Gaynor , rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford . Trump said he will personally host the awards program.He also announced plans to fully renovate the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, calling it a future “crown jewel” of American arts and culture.“We're going to bring it to a higher level than it ever hit,” Trump said. The upgraded venue will feature in next year’s celebrations marking America’s 250th anniversary. Trump added that he didn’t want to host the program but was invited to do so and agreed.Trump, who avoided the event during his first term after some artists boycotted in protest, has since taken control of the institution. Earlier this year, he replaced the Kennedy Center’s board of trustees with his own appointees.In a Truth Social post on Tuesday, Trump jokingly referred to change the name for the center to “Trump/Kennedy Center” and promised to restore it to “top-level” luxury and glamour.The post read, "" Great Nominees for the Trump/Kennedy Center, whoops, I mean, Kennedy Centre awards.They will be announced Wednesday. Tremendous work is being done, and money being spent, on bringing it back to the absolute top level of luxury, glamour, and entertainment.""""It had fallen on hard times, physically, but will soon be making a major comeback!!! President DJT.""In a statement on social media, the Kennedy Center said it was “honored” to host Trump, who was visiting for the third time since January. “Thanks to his advocacy, our beautiful building will undergo renovations to restore its prestige and grandeur,” the venue said.During a visit to the building in March, Trump had criticized the venue’s condition, calling it in “tremendous disrepair.”Trump said he was “about 98% involved” in selecting this year’s honorees, rejecting some candidates he considered “too woke” or too liberal. He described the artists, including several of his favorites, as “great people.”Traditionally, a bipartisan advisory committee has made the selections, but it is unclear how the process was handled this year.The Kennedy Center Honors, established in 1978, have recognized a wide range of artists, often with presidents from both parties in attendance. Past honorees have included both political allies and opponents of sitting presidents.During his first term in 2017, Trump and First Lady Melania Trump skipped the event after several recipients, including Norman Lear, said they would not attend in protest of Trump’s proposed arts funding cuts. Since returning to office, Trump has taken a more direct role in the center’s governance, including influencing programming decisions and pledging to end performances featuring drag artists.These moves have drawn criticism from parts of the arts community. In March, the producers of Hamilton withdrew plans to stage the musical at the center in 2026, citing Trump’s leadership changes.In July, House Republicans added an amendment to a spending bill, later signed by Trump, to rename the Kennedy Center’s Opera House in honor of Melania Trump. The change has not yet been implemented. Maria Shriver , a Democrat and niece of the late President Kennedy, called this move as “insane.”","US President Donald Trump has named the first batch of Kennedy Center Honors recipients under his leadership as the center’s chairman.

‘One BrahMos after another’: BJP leader Mithun Chakraborty warns Pakistan; bizarre ‘dam’ remark aimed at Bilawal Bhutto,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/one-brahmos-after-another-bjp-leader-mithun-chakraborty-warns-pakistan-bizarre-dam-remark-aimed-at-bilawal-bhutto/articleshow/123260318.cms,"



NEW DELHI: Actor-turned-BJP leader Mithun Chakraborty on Tuesday hit back at Pakistan People’s Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari over his remarks on the Indus Waters Treaty , warning that India could respond with “a series of BrahMos missiles” in case of any provocation.Speaking to reporters, Chakraborty accused the Pakistani establishment of warmongering while emphasising that his comments were not directed at the people of Pakistan, whom he described as peace-loving. “If such words and rhetoric continue to be made, and we lose our cool, we will dispatch one BrahMos after another to strike them,” he said.Chakraborty also made an unusual remark, claiming that India would build a dam where “140 crore Indians will relieve themselves” before releasing the water to unleash a “tsunami” on Pakistan, adding that the comment was aimed solely at Bhutto-Zardari.“We will build a dam where 140 crore of our people will relieve themselves. And once the dam is opened, it will lead to a tsunami without a single shot being fired. I apologise for saying this. These words are only meant for him (Bhutto), not for the people of Pakistan,” he said.His statement came in response to Bhutto’s speech at the shrine of Sindhi saint Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai on Monday, where the Pakistani leader warned New Delhi against any attempt to disrupt the Indus River’s flow. ““If war is waged, then… we will send a message to the Modi government that we do not retreat, we do not bow down, and if you dare think about launching an attack on the Indus River, then the people of every province of Pakistan will be ready to confront you. ”Tensions over the treaty have risen since April 22, when India placed the 1960 agreement “in abeyance” following the Pahalgam terror attack.",Actor-turned-BJP leader Mithun Chakraborty hit back at Pakistan People’s Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari over his remarks on the Indus Waters Treaty.

‘Seed Of Pakistan Will Be Destroyed’: Foreign Affairs Expert Warns Islamabad After Nuke Threat





PESHAWAR/ISLAMABAD: Four people were injured when an improvised explosive device derailed six coaches of the Peshawar-bound Jafar Express in the Mastung district of Pakistan's restive Balochistan province on Sunday.There were, however, no casualties, officials said.This is the latest in a series of attacks targeting the Jafar Express.The improvised explosive device (IED) explosion hit the track near Spezand Railway Station, about 25 km from Quetta, shortly after the train with 350 passengers had departed the city at 9 am (local time), a railways official said.""A bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train heading from Quetta to Peshawar. Fortunately, there was no loss of life,"" Muhammad Kashif, public relations officer of the Pakistan Railways' Quetta division, told the media.All injured passengers sustained minor wounds, the official said.Rescue teams, including railway staff, were dispatched to the site, and a relief train was sent to transport stranded passengers to Quetta.Security forces and police cordoned off the area, while a bomb disposal squad was deployed to clear the track.Meanwhile, in a separate statement, Kashif said the services of the Jaffar Express and Bolan Mail were suspended till August 14.The Bolan Mail will resume its operations on August 16 (Saturday), when it will depart from Karachi ""in its proper turn"" and will arrive in Quetta the next day, he added.The Jafar Express, which runs between Quetta and Peshawar, has been repeatedly targeted in recent months.On August 7, the train narrowly escaped a disaster near Balochistan's Sibi railway station, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train had passed.In another incident, on August 4, gunmen fired five bullets at its pilot engine near Kolpur. The separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the latter attack.In June, a remotely controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks exploded, causing four bogies of the Jaffar Express to derail in Jacobabad.On March 11, the Jaffar Express was hijacked while traveling from Quetta to Peshawar in the Bolan area, resulting in the deaths of 21 passengers and four security personnel. The security forces in a targeted operation killed 33 terrorists involved in attacking the train.It is believed that ethnic Baloch terrorist groups carry out such attacks.A July 28 derailment of the same train in Sindh province's Sukkur was initially attributed to an explosion but the Ministry of Railways later said it was due to a technical fault.","A bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train heading from Quetta to Peshawar.

Pakistan: Tablighi Jamaat's grip on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fuels concerns of radicalisation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tablighi-jamaats-grip-on-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-fuels-concerns-of-radicalisation/articleshow/123203430.cms,"Pakistan: Tablighi Jamaat's grip on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fuels concerns of radicalisation





KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA: The rise of the Tablighi Jamaat in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province is sparking fears of cultural erosion and the steady grooming of recruits for radical movements. As reported by Himal Southasian, many Pashtuns say the orthodox Deobandi missionary group is dismantling traditional practices while quietly laying the ideological groundwork for extremism.In Bajaur district, a young resident told Himal Southasian that ""men and women used to dress fashionably, enjoy music, watch television, visit shrines, and play sports without being judged."" Today, he said, the Tablighi Jamaat's puritanical preaching has transformed local life. Activities once central to Pashtun culture are now branded as sinful. ""It has changed the cultural landscape drastically,"" he warned, noting that while the group does not directly preach violence, it produces ""raw human resources that can be easily turned into jihadists. ""Founded in colonial India in 1926, the Tablighi Jamaat is now a global organisation with millions of followers. In Pakistan, its headquarters in Raiwind, Punjab, commands vast influence.According to Himal Southasian, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has become one of the movement's most fertile grounds, with the group leveraging its ""quietist"" image to avoid official scrutiny while embedding Deobandi orthodoxy deep into Pashtun society.The group's impact is most visible in cultural change. Himal Southasian documents how shrines, folk music, mixed-gender dances, and colourful traditional clothing are being replaced by conservative dress codes and rigid segregation. A North Waziristan academic described the Jamaat as ""the root of evil... laying the ideological groundwork for the future Taliban"" and importing an ""Arab culture"" that dismisses Pashtun identity.While the Tablighi Jamaat insists it is apolitical and non-violent, Himal Southasian reports that it shares the sectarian orientation of groups such as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Its close alignment with the Pakistan state's Islamisation project dates back to the 1980s, when military ruler Zia ul-Haq and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) used Deobandi networks - including Tablighi circles - to recruit Pashtun fighters for the Afghan jihad against the Soviet Union. Former ISI chief Javed Nasir was himself a Tablighi Jamaat member.Critics in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa told Himal Southasian that the group's influence has depoliticised Pashtun communities, discouraging discussion of exploitation or military abuses. This ideological shift, they argue, suits the Pakistani establishment, which has long used Islam as a tool for domestic control and foreign policy. A Peshawar lecturer warned that ""Tablighis are making our people orthodox, helping Islamist sectarian groups"" and turning them away from Pashtun nationalism and resistance to militancy.The group's gatherings draw hundreds of thousands annually to Raiwind and regional centres. A businessperson from Khyber district told Himal Southasian that almost every household in the tribal areas now has a member. The Jamaat's appeal as a ""peaceful"" alternative to militant brutality has made it a mass movement - but one that critics say nurtures a mindset receptive to Taliban influence.Perhaps most troubling, Himal Southasian notes, is the way the Tablighi Jamaat erodes ethnic identity in favour of pan-Islamic loyalty. This mirrors the Taliban's removal of Afghanistan's national flag in favour of the white shahada banner. ""Extremism and war have taken away every good thing from us,"" a South Waziristan student lamented.For Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's embattled Pashtuns, the rise of the Tablighi Jamaat represents more than religious revival - it signals Pakistan's ongoing project to reshape a proud, distinct culture into a pliant tool for its Islamist and geopolitical ambitions. As Himal Southasian's reporting makes clear, the consequences are already visible, and they reach far beyond the mosque walls.","Tablighi Jamaat's influence in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province fuels concerns of radicalisation.

The body of a man missing for 28 years has been discovered in a melting glacier in Pakistan’s remote Kohistan region. A shepherd, identified as Omar Khan, came across the well-preserved remains, clothing still intact, in the Lady Valley, located in the country’s eastern mountains.""What I saw was unbelievable,"" Omar was quoted as saying by the BBC. ""The body was intact. The clothes were not even torn.""An ID card was found with the body bearing the name Naseeruddin, allowing police to identify him as a man who went missing in June 1997 after falling into a glacier crevasse in the area.Once police confirmed the body was that of Naseeruddin, locals came forward with additional information, Khan said.Naseeruddin, who was married with two children, was travelling on horseback with his brother on the day he disappeared. The two had reportedly left home due to a family dispute, as per the police, reports the BBC.His brother, who was with Naseeruddin during the 1997 incident, said they had chosen an unconventional mountain route to avoid possible threats, reports the Express Tribune.He recalled hearing gunfire on their return journey, and in an attempt to escape the attackers, Naseeruddin took refuge in an icy cave, never to be seen again.An extensive search was carried out at that time, but Naseeruddin could not be traced, and a symbolic funeral was held at the location.With the body finally recovered after 28 years, his brother is returning to Lady Valley to determine whether to lay the remains to rest there or bring them back to the family’s ancestral home.Reduced snowfall in the region has left glaciers more exposed to direct sunlight, accelerating the ice-melting process, highlighting how higher temperatures are speeding up glacial melt, reports the BBC.","The body of a man missing for 28 years has been discovered in a melting glacier in Pakistan’s remote Kohistan region.

India Slams Pakistan Army Chief Asim Munir’s ‘Half The World’ Nuclear Threat With Sharp Rebuttal





The Pakistan Army on Wednesday firmly dismissed as ""baseless"" speculation that its Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir is seeking to become the country’s next president, amid persistent rumours circulating on social media.""Talks about Field Marshal Asim Munir becoming the president are completely baseless,"" said Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry in an interview with The Economist, a clip of which was shared by the state-run PTV on social media.Chaudhry asserted that ""the army chief has no interest in the presidency and no such proposal is under consideration.""The clarification comes after weeks of unverified reports suggesting Munir might replace the incumbent President, Asif Ali Zardari . Both Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and interior minister Mohsin Naqvi had previously dismissed the rumours as a “malicious campaign” aimed at spreading ""political instability.""In May, Munir was elevated to the rarely conferred rank of Field Marshal following a brief four-day conflict with India. The move, which made him only the second five-star officer in Pakistan’s history after Ayub Khan, was widely viewed as a signal of the army chief further consolidating his authority.In a country where the army chief's position is the most powerful, and no civilian prime minister has completed a full term, the elevation was seen by many as a clear assertion of the military's primacy over the political leadership.","Pakistan Army dismisses speculation that its Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir is seeking to become the country’s next president.

A United Nations-backed investigator has revealed disturbing evidence of “systemic torture” inside Myanmar’s detention centres, describing electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape and the burning of sexual body parts among the abuses that were documented over the past year.Nicholas Koumjian, head of the international independent team investigating atrocities in the country, spoke as the group released its latest annual report on Tuesday, covering the 12 months to 30 June.The country has been in turmoil since February 2021, ever since the army overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, sparking a civil war. As peaceful protests were crushed with lethal force, those opposing military rule took up arms.Since then, conflict has engulfed large parts of Myanmar.The investigative team, as quoted by AP, said that it had made progress in identifying security personnel involved in detention operations, as well as “perpetrators who have summarily executed captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers.”These perpetrators included members of the security forces, affiliated militias and opposition armed groups.The report details the ""documented torture in Myanmar’s detention facilities which includes beatings, electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,"" according to a summary of the findings.“Our report highlights a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities committed in Myanmar,” Koumjian said. “We are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law.”“We have uncovered significant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, showing systematic torture in Myanmar detention facilities,” he further added.The team also launched new investigations into atrocities committed in Rakhine state, where the military and the Arakan Army, an opposition force, are battling for control.Rakhine has long been the scene of grave abuses. More than 700,000 people from the Rohingya minority fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017 to escape persecution. About 70,000 more crossed the border last year after the Arakan Army effectively seized control of the territory.The Independent Investigative Mechanism on Myanmar has been operating since 2018 under a mandate from the UN-backed Human Rights Council to document human rights abuses and violations in the country.It has already shared evidence with authorities pursuing cases involving the Rohingya at the International Criminal Court and the UN’s International Court of Justice.","U.N.-backed team releases annual report covering the 12 months to 30 June.

Three Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion on Saturday while patrolling near the Cambodian border, just days after the two countries agreed to extend a fragile ceasefire following their deadliest clashes in decades.The blast took place in Sisaket province at around 10 AM local time (0300 GMT), the Royal Thai Military said in a statement. One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage from the blast’s pressure.Tensions have been high since last month’s five-day conflict over disputed ancient temples along the 800-kilometre (500-mile) border, which left at least 43 people dead and forced more than 300,000 residents from their homes.

An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS). The quake occurred at 2:24 pm IST, at a depth of 155 kilometers. The epicenter was located at latitude 36.51°N and longitude 70.70°E within the Afghan territory.This was the second quake recorded today, as seismic activity continues to affect the region. Earlier, a magnitude 4.2 earthquake struck at 12:19 pm IST. It occurred at a depth of 47 kilometers, with the epicenter located at latitude 36.54°N and longitude 71.52°E.This is the latest in a series of earthquakes to hit the region in recent days. On August 2, a stronger earthquake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale struck Afghanistan at a depth of 87 kilometers. Prior to that, on July 29, a 4.8-magnitude earthquake was recorded at a shallow depth of just 10 kilometers.Shallow earthquakes are more dangerous than deep earthquakes. This is so because the seismic waves from shallow earthquakes have a shorter distance to travel to the surface, resulting in stronger ground shaking causing more damage to structures and greater casualties.According to the Red Cross, Afghanistan lies on several fault lines between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain region, making it one of the most earthquake-prone areas in the world.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), Afghanistan warn that frequent quakes continue to pose a serious threat to communities in the country, which are already vulnerable due to decades of conflict and underdevelopment.The organization also noted that the country is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including seasonal flooding, landslides and earthquakes.","An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday.

Bangladesh Interim Chief Yunus To Stay After Resignation Threat Amid Protests Over Rohingya Corridor

July Declaration unveiled:

Tight security and public celebration:





Bangladesh’s interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus on Tuesday announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026, ahead of the holy month of Ramadan. He made the declaration during his address to the nation via state television, BTV and radio to mark the first anniversary of the mass uprising that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ""On behalf of the interim government, I will write to the Chief Election Commissioner, requesting that the Election Commission organise a national election in February 2026, before the next Ramadan,"" Yunus said.The announcement marks a shift from his earlier indication that polls would be held in April. The revised timeline comes after consultations with major political parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia which had called for earlier elections.""We will all begin mental preparation and institutional arrangements from tomorrow to complete all arrangements so that this year's election is memorable in the country's history in terms of joy and celebration, peace and order, voter turnout, and cordiality,"" he added.Yunus urged political parties to ensure that youth and women are not excluded from their manifestos or future governance plans. ""Remember, the youth who have changed Bangladesh have the power to change the world as well,"" he said.Earlier today, the interim government had also formally released the ""July Declaration"", a 26-point document outlining proposed reforms in governance, constitutional and political issues.Top leaders from political groups such as the BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, and the newly formed National Citizen Party (NCP) were present during the official unveiling at the Bangladesh Parliament Complex, commemorating the uprising anniversary.The declaration sharply criticized the 1972 Constitution after its independence war against Pakistan in 1971, calling for reforms aligned with the will of the people.""Whereas, the post-independence Awami League government failed to materialise the people's aspirations because of the weaknesses in the procedures of drafting and in the structure of the constitution, along with its inappropriate application,"" the July Declaration said.It also condemned Sheikh Hasina’s administration, accusing it of turning Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state through alleged authoritarian rule and human rights violations.""Whereas, during the rule of Sheikh Hasina, under her very leadership, an extreme force that was anti-people, autocratic and against human rights turned Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state and thereby tarnished Bangladesh's international image,"" it added.The document calls for the 2024 uprising to be given official recognition and proposes that the July Declaration be included in a reformed constitution.Tens of thousands gathered at Manik Mia Avenue in Dhaka to mark the anniversary of Hasina’s ouster. The government declared the day a national holiday. Security was heightened across the capital, with police checkpoints and patrols in sensitive areas.Sheikh Hasina, who had been in power for 15 years, fled to India in August last year following mass protests. Her party, the Awami League, has since been banned by the interim administration, and its registration has been revoked by the Election Commission, effectively barring it from contesting in future polls unless the ban is lifted.Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch (HRW) raised concerns over the interim government's progress on human rights.""The hope of the thousands who braved lethal violence a year ago when they opposed Sheikh Hasina's abusive rule to build a rights-respecting democracy remains unfulfilled,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at HRW.She warned that the interim leadership is struggling to balance security reform with pressures from hardliners and rival political factions.As the nation reflects on the events of the past year, Bangladesh remains on high alert. The month of August also marks the anniversary of the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country’s founding figure and Hasina’s father.","Bangladesh's interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026. He made the declaration during his address to the nation via state television, BTV and radio to mark the first anniversary of the mass uprising that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123122977,imgsize-585382,width-400,resizemode-4/123122977.jpg"
UK court of appeal refuses to increase sentence of boy who killed Bhim Kohli,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-court-of-appeal-refuses-to-increase-sentence-of-boy-who-killed-bhim-kohli/articleshow/123288743.cms,"



LONDON: Court of Appeal judges here have refused to increase the seven-year sentence given to a 15-year-old boy for killing much-loved 80-year-old British Indian grandfather Bhim Kohli, saying the sentence he was handed down was correct.On Wednesday, Lady Justice Macur, Justice Cutts and Justice Murray dismissed the application by the solicitor-general for permission to appeal against the boy’s sentence on the basis it was unduly lenient.The judges also dismissed an application for permission to appeal the sentence by the boy’s lawyer, Balraj Bhatia KC, who claimed it was “manifestly excessive”.Lucy Rigby KC had referred the case to the Court of Appeal in July. The boy was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter in April and sentenced in June.Kohli, an active and fit man who was held in high regard by the local community, was killed on Sept 1, 2024 while walking his dog in a Leicestershire park. The boy, then aged 14, put on a balaclava, knocked him to the ground, then hit him round the head with his slider shoe as he was on his knees trying to get up as a girl he was with, then aged 12, laughed and filmed the attack on her mobile.The boy attacked Kohli a second time near the park exit, punching and kicking him, breaking three ribs. He died later in hospital.The sentencing was enhanced due to aggravating factors which included the boy calling Kohli a “Paki”. Kohli was born in Punjab, India.Bhatia argued that calling Kohli a “Paki” was at the lower end of the scale of racism and the addition to the sentence was excessive. The court heard the boy’s sentence was half what an adult would get.Lady Justice Macur said: “We understand that not only his family but the public too were shocked at the lenient sentence of 7 years. However , the sentencing of children and young people for serious offences is complex. Many are not fully developed and may not understand the pain they cause to victims. The court must bear in mind the principle is to prevent offending and the welfare of the child. We do not find the sentence unduly lenient. ”She rejected the argument that adding six months to the sentence for racial aggravating factors was excessive and praised Kohli’s “sunny disposition” and “enjoyment of life” to his family who were in court.","Court of Appeal judges refuse to increase the seven-year sentence given to a 15-year-old boy for killing much-loved British Indian grandfather Bhim Kohli. Lady Justice Macur, Justice Cutts and Justice Murray dismissed the application by the solicitor-general for permission to appeal against the boy’s sentence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123290969,imgsize-992989,width-400,resizemode-4/123290969.jpg"
