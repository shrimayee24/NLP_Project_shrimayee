"SC frees man jailed 13 years for rape of 4-year-old girl, slams ‘botched’ probe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-frees-man-jailed-13-years-for-rape-of-4-year-old-girl-slams-botched-probe/articleshow/125993404.cms,".

Gujarat police

hopelessly botched probe that obscured, rather than unveiled, the truth: SC

New Delhi: It is a case where both the accused and the survivor ended as sufferers of the justice delivery system as injustice was done to the former who had to spend 13 years in jail for a crime he did not commit, while the latter was denied justice as the real perpetrator of sexual assault on her when she was four years old was not brought to book.Noting that the police conducted a “hopelessly botched investigation” and cooked up a story against the accused to protect the real culprit, and lower courts mechanically accepted the prosecution’s version and failed to unveil the truth, an SC bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta acquitted the accused in the case of sexual assault of a girl in Godhra in 2013.The relief came after the accused, who was sentenced to life imprisonment by trial court and Gujarat HC, had spent 13 years in jail.This court cannot remain oblivious to the sobering reality that such handling of criminal cases leaves scars not merely upon the individuals involved but upon the justice system itself. When investigations are carried out in a manner that betrays their foundational purpose, and trials become mechanical exercises divorced from the quest for truth, the resulting miscarriage of justice reverberates far beyond the confines of the courtroom.It erodes public faith, instils uncertainty in victims, and sends a chilling message to society at large that the pursuit of justice may falter not at the altar of complexity but at the hands of indifference. The criminal law, which must stand as a bulwark protecting the vulnerable, risks becoming an instrument of unintended cruelty when procedural lapses and institutional negligence overshadow substantive justice,” the SC bench said.It expressed deep concern over the way in which Gujarat police conducted the probe. After examining the statements of various witnesses, the court came to conclusion that the entire story implicating the accused for the crime was cooked up after consultations and deliberations on the day after to the incident. The effect of this grave embellishment on the prosecution case was not considered in the correct perspective either by the trial court or HC, the bench said.“A grave and distressing case of brutal sexual assault upon a four-year old girl stands before this court, enveloped in layers of investigative apathy and procedural infirmities. The FIR, despite the informant’s professed complete knowledge of the incident, is bereft of even the most rudimentary details, neither the name of the accused person (appellant herein) nor those of the purported witnesses of the last seen together circumstance find mention. What followed was an investigation hopelessly botched and a trial conducted with a pedantic rigidity that obscured, rather than unveiled, the truth. The highly unnatural conduct of the witnesses, marked by gross insensitivity/rank apathy, contradictions and apparent concoctions raises serious doubts about the reliability of the prosecution’s case. Yet, in face of this disturbing matrix, the accused stands convicted and has remained behind bars for nearly thirteen long years,” it said.The court said the investigating officer failed to secure and preserve crucial forensic material which would have provided objective corroboration and assisted in ascertaining the truth. It said the failure not only weakens the prosecution’s case but also raises a legitimate apprehension that the investigation may not have been carried out with the requisite fairness and diligence and the possibility that “such inaction was intended, or at least operated, to shield the actual perpetrators of the offence cannot be ruled out”.","An SC bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta acquitted the accused in the case of sexual assault of a girl in Godhra in 2013.

NEW DELHI: A policeman was killed and a terrorist was believed to be injured in a gunfight with security forces in a remote forest village of Udhampur district in Jammu and Kashmir on Monday evening, officials said. The encounter has since halted, but the area remains under a tight security cordon with all escape routes sealed.The gunfight broke out at village Soan in the Majalta area after security forces launched a cordon-and-search operation following specific intelligence inputs about the presence of terrorists believed to be affiliated with the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad outfit, officials said.Inspector General of Police, Jammu, Bhim Sen Tuti said contact was established after police received precise information. “Joint team of Special Operations Group (SOG) of police along with Army and CRPF are on job,” he said.In another post, the IGP said, “a very small SOG team engaged the terrorists! Combing of the forest has been impeded due to darkness and treacherous terrain.”Officials said the encounter began around 6 pm when joint teams of the Army, police and paramilitary forces intensified the search operation in the Soan–Martha area of Majalta tehsil.“As the security forces intensified the search operation, the hiding terrorists opened fire, which was retaliated to, triggering an encounter,” an official said.One terrorist was believed to have been hit in the initial exchange of fire, officials said, adding that intermittent firing continued for some time before the operation was suspended for the night due to poor visibility and difficult terrain. The search operation is expected to resume with the first light of day on Tuesday.Reinforcements have been rushed to the area to strengthen the cordon and prevent the terrorists from escaping, officials added.(With inputs from PTI)",A policeman was killed and a terrorist was believed to be injured in a gunfight with security forces in Jammu and Kashmir on Monday evening.

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday filed its chargesheet in the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack case against seven accused, including a Pakistani handler, terror outfits Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and its proxy, The Resistance Front (TRF), and others.The anti-terror agency presented the chargesheet before the NIA Special Court in Jammu.The 1,597-page chargesheet named the handler, Sajid Jatt, along with three Pakistani terrorists neutralised by security forces during Operation Mahadev at Dachigam in Srinagar in July. They have been identified as Faisal Jatt alias Suleman Shah, Habeeb Tahir alias Jibran, and Hamza Afghani.Further, the chargesheet has arraigned the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and The Resistance Front (TRF) as legal entities for their role in planning, facilitating and executing the Pahalgam assault. It has also invoked the penal section against the accused for waging war against India.The development comes nearly six months after the agency arrested two men for harbouring the terrorists who carried out the deadly attack.The men — Parvaiz Ahmad Jothar and Bashir Ahmad Jothar — were arrested on June 22 for harbouring the terrorists, and have been named in the chargesheet. During interrogation, the duo had reportedly disclosed the identities of the attackers and confirmed they were Pakistani nationals affiliated with the proscribed LeT.On April 22, the three heavily armed terrorists shot dead 26 civilians — all men — including a local and a tourist from Nepal, in Pahalgam’s Baisaran Valley.After announcing a series of diplomatic measures, India responded with Operation Sindoor, carrying out airstrikes on terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on May 7. The strikes triggered intense cross-border clashes that were halted after Islamabad sought a ceasefire on May 10.","The 1,597-page chargesheet named the handler, Sajid Jatt, along with three Pakistani terrorists neutralised by security forces in July.

India Slams Pakistan As ‘Global Epicentre Of Terror’, Vows To Counter Pak-Sponsored Attacks At UN

NEW DELHI: India on Monday firmly rejected Pakistan ’s reference to Jammu and Kashmir during an open debate at the United Nations Security Council , saying the Union territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral part of India and will always remain so.Speaking at the UNSC Open Debate on 'Leadership for Peace', India’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Harish P, said Pakistan’s repeated mention of Jammu and Kashmir reflected an “obsessive focus” on harming India and its people.He said: ""I refer to the statement made by the representative of Pakistan today. India would like to reiterate that the Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India. They were, are, and will always remain so. Pakistan’s unwarranted reference to Jammu & Kashmir in today’s open debate attests to its obsessive focus on harming India and its people. A serving non-permanent Security Council Member that chooses to further this obsession in all meetings and platforms of the UN in pursuit of its divisive agenda cannot be expected to fulfil its designated responsibilities and obligations.The Indian envoy said India signed the Indus Waters Treaty 65 years ago in good faith and with a spirit of friendship. However, he said Pakistan had violated the spirit of the treaty over the decades by waging three wars and sponsoring thousands of terror attacks against India. He added that tens of thousands of Indian lives have been lost in Pakistan-sponsored terrorism over the last four decades.Referring to the April 2025 Pahalgam terror attack, the ambassador said, ""The Pahalgam terror attack in April 2025, involved religion-based targeted killings of 26 innocent civilians by Pakistan-sponsored terrorists. It is in this backdrop that India has finally announced that the Treaty will be held in abeyance until Pakistan, which is a global epicentre of terror, credibly and irrevocably ends its support for cross-border and all other forms of terrorism. ""India criticised Pakistan's domestic political situation over jailing former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and allowing its armed forces to engineer a ""constitutional coup"" through the new 27th amendment, which granted lifetime immunity to its chief of defence forces Asim Munir.""Pakistan, of course, has a unique way of respecting the will of its people - by jailing a Prime Minister, by banning the ruling political party and by letting its armed forces engineer a constitutional coup through the 27th amendment and giving lifetime immunity to its Chief of Defence Forces,"" Parvathaneni said.He further added that India would continue to counter Pakistan-sponsored terrorism in all its forms with full resolve.",India firmly rejected Pakistan’s reference to Jammu and Kashmir during an open debate at the United Nations Security Council.

'Black Day': Owaisi Targets Modi Govt, Questions Acquittals In Babri Masjid Demolition Case

NEW DELHI: The Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) on Monday said that the proposed construction of a mosque modelled on Ayodhya’s Babri Masjid in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district amounts to an offence under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).The organisation has urged the state government to order the registration of an FIR against suspended Trinamool Congress MLA Humayun Kabir , news agency PTI reported.In a letter addressed to chief minister Mamata Banerjee, VHP president Alok Kumar alleged that the proposed naming of the mosque after Mughal ruler Babur was a “deliberate symbolic act” that was foreseeably offensive to Hindus and had the potential to promote religious enmity.Kumar claimed that Babur is historically associated with the destruction of Hindu religious sites and that naming a mosque after him, when viewed alongside the statements made by Kabir, indicated that the move was neither accidental nor incidental. He described it as a “malicious act likely to outrage Hindu religious feelings”.The VHP chief urged the West Bengal government to examine the applicability of Sections 196 and 299 of the BNS and other relevant provisions and to take legal action by filing an FIR against Kabir and his associates.On December 6, the suspended TMC leader laid the foundation stone for a mosque modelled on the Babri Masjid at Rejinagar in Murshidabad district amid heavy security.The event, held on the anniversary of the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition, added to political tensions in the state ahead of the assembly elections due early next year.The ceremony was conducted under tight security, with state police, Rapid Action Force and central forces deployed across Rejinagar and neighbouring Beldanga, which were turned into controlled zones.Taking strong exception to the move, Kumar said in his letter that the speeches made by Kabir showed that the act was deliberate.""The choice of the name and the date of commencement of construction, and the statements and speeches by Humayun Kabir, MLA, show that this is deliberate,"" Kumar said.The VHP chief highlighted that Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty in India, remains a deeply contentious historical figure, particularly in relation to Hindu religious and cultural sentiments.",The Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) said that the proposed construction of a mosque modelled on Ayodhya’s Babri Masjid amounts to an offence under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) The organisation has urged the state government to order the registration of an FIR against suspended Trinamool Congress MLA Humayun Kabir.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125986018,imgsize-408153,width-400,resizemode-4/humayun-kabir.jpg"

Candace Owens and Erika Kirk disagree over conspiracy claims linked to Charlie Kirk







Candace Owens and Erika Kirk are now part of a public fight that has confused many people online. The issue is serious because it involves rumors, strong claims, and personal pain, all linked to false stories spreading about Charlie Kirk On September, 10, 2025, Charlie Kirk was shot at Utah University, while giving a speech. A person aimed a shot at him from the crowd.Candace Owens, a well-known political voice, questioned what she called the “official version” of events connected to Charlie Kirk. Her comments quickly went viral. Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s wife, reacted strongly. She said these stories were false and deeply hurtful.What followed was not just an online disagreement. It became a public fight about truth, trust, and responsibility. Many people are now asking what was actually said, what is proven, and what should never have been shared.Candace Owens shared statements online where she raised doubts and pushed theories without proof. In one video, she said, “I do not believe the story we are being told. I think there are too many unanswered questions.” She suggested that powerful people or groups could be involved, but she did not show any evidence.Candace Owens' claims are widely considered as false or just theories by several agencies and media reports.Erika Kirk responded soon after. She asked Candace to stop. In a public message, Erika said, “Please stop spreading conspiracy theories. This is painful for our family, and it is not true.” She explained that rumors were making an already difficult time worse.The situation became more heated when Candace accused Erika of wanting privacy while also being public. Candace used the phrase “Meghan Markle syndrome,” suggesting Erika wanted attention when it suited her. This comment caused backlash.Erika did not accept that claim. She said grief should not be judged and lies should not be turned into content. Supporters on both sides began arguing online, which pushed the story even further.Later, both Candace Owens and Erika Kirk said they were open to speaking directly to each other to clear things up.

Tragic Delhi-Agra Expressway Collision: Multiple Buses Catch Fire; Casualties Reported,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/delhi-agra-expressway-crash-several-buses-catch-fire-after-collision-many-feared-dead-rescue-op-launched/articleshow/125993342.cms,"At least four people were killed and 25 others injured after a collision involving seven buses and three cars on the Yamuna Expressway

AGRA: At least four people were killed and 25 others injured after a collision involving seven buses and three cars on the Yamuna Expressway in the early hours of Tuesday, police said.Preliminary reports suggest that the victims were charred to death after the buses caught fire following the crash.The accident occurred around 4.30 am on the Agra–Noida stretch of the Yamuna Expressway, near Milestone 127, under the jurisdiction of Baldeo police station in Mathura district. Police said heavy fog and low visibility led to the pile-up involving multiple vehicles.Of the injured, all were rushed to nearby hospitals for primary treatment. Police said none of the injured is in critical condition.Speaking about the incident, SSP Mathura Shlok Kumar said the crash was triggered by poor visibility caused by dense fog. “Around 4.30 am, approximately seven buses and three small vehicles collided with each other due to low visibility. The vehicles caught fire after the collision. Local administration and emergency teams reached the spot immediately,” he said.He added that rescue operations are nearly complete. “So far, four deaths have been confirmed. Around 25 people have been admitted to hospital and none of them is serious. They are being provided the best possible treatment. The expressway was completely blocked, so traffic has been diverted from behind. The debris has now been removed and passengers have been sent to their destinations using government vehicles,” the SSP said.SP Mathura Rural Suresh Chandra Rawat said three cars first collided with each other, following which seven buses — including one roadways bus and six sleeper buses — rammed into them.“All the buses caught fire. Eleven fire tenders are at the spot and the fire has now been brought under control. Four dead bodies have been recovered so far. Rescue work is underway,” he said.Rescue and firefighting operations are currently underway. Fire tenders, police teams and ambulances have been deployed, and traffic on the affected stretch has been halted.The fatal crash on the Delhi–Agra Expressway comes a day after dense fog triggered multiple pile-ups across NCR expressways, leaving at least six people dead and several injured.The first major accident occurred near Raniyala Patakpur village in Nuh district, where at least 20 vehicles, including two trucks, were involved in a chain collision on the Delhi–Mumbai Expressway. Two people — CISF inspector Harish Kumar (38) from Alwar and Khalil (45) from Jaipur — were killed, while five others were injured.Another pile-up involving seven to eight vehicles was reported near Banarsi village on the same expressway, though no injuries were recorded. A separate accident on Delhi–Alwar Road near Ghaseda village involved a Haryana Roadways bus and a tractor, causing damage but no casualties.In Faridabad, a Ford Endeavour rammed into a stationary truck near Kail village on the Delhi–Mumbai Expressway, killing two men from Jaipur. A third occupant later succumbed to injuries during treatment.On the other side of NCR, two pile-ups involving around 20 vehicles were reported on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway near Attai village in Noida, leaving a 24-year-old truck driver dead and 13 others injured, police said.Traffic police across NCR said dense fog and near-zero visibility were the common factors in all the crashes and urged motorists to slow down, maintain lane discipline and avoid stopping on expressways during foggy conditions.",Accident occurred around 4.30 am on the Agra–Noida stretch of the Yamuna Expressway. Police said heavy fog and low visibility led to the pile-up involving multiple vehicles. Crash comes a day after dense fog triggered multiple pile-ups across NCR expressways.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125993800,imgsize-526058,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/at-least-four-people-were-killed-and-25-others-injured-after-a-collision-involving-seven-buses-and-three-cars-on-the-yamuna-expressway.jpg"
‘Revenge for Moose Wala’: Kabaddi player shot dead in front of hundreds at Mohali tournament,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/revenge-for-moose-wala-kabaddi-player-shot-dead-in-front-of-hundreds-at-mohali-tournament/articleshow/125989552.cms,".

MOHALI: A kabaddi player and promoter was shot dead in front of hundreds of spectators at a tournament in Mohali on Monday evening, triggering panic at the venue and triggering concerns over law and order in Punjab. It was revenge for Sidhu Moose Wala's murder, a rival gang of Lawrence Bishnoi boasted on social media, naming the killers as 'Makkhan Amritsar and Defaulter Karne'.The victim, Kanwar Digvijay Singh alias Rana Balachauria, 30, was a well-known kabaddi promoter as well. He was married just 10 days ago.The attackers approached Balachauria for selfies while Sohana Kabaddi Cup was on, and gunned him down at point-blank range, said Mohali senior SP Harmandeep Singh Hans. Police have confirmed the gang's social media post.Police said Balachauria was one of the organisers of the tournament being held in Sector 82 sports ground of Mohali. Two hitmen arrived on a motorcycle and managed to get close to Balachauria on the pretext of selfies. Balachauria was used to people asking to be clicked with him and suspected nothing.As soon as they got close, they drew pistols and started shooting in front of horrified spectators, players and organisers.Even as the crowd of 500-600 scattered in panic, the gunmen fired several shots in the air to cover their escape.Hit multiple times, Balachauria collapsed on the ground. Police took him to a private hospital, where doctors declared him dead on arrival.Police recovered four to five empty shells of.32 calibre around the blood-soaked patch of earth. ""Prima facie, it appears six to seven rounds were fired. Teams from crime branch and local police have fanned out in multiple directions. CCTV footage from the area is being analysed,"" the SSP said.Eyewitnesses described scenes of confusion and terror following the attack. ""There was panic and chaos everywhere. People were running and screaming. We could not understand what happened at first and then pandemonium broke out,"" said a witness.Minutes after the murder, the Chaudhary-Shaganpreet gang claimed responsibility, claiming they had ""avenged the death of their brother Sidhu Moosewala"".In a social media post, the gang wrote, ""Today, at the Mohali Sohana Sahib Kabaddi Cup, Rana Balachauria was murdered and we — Doni Bal, Saganpreet, Mohabbat Randhawa, Amar Khabbe, Prabh Dasuwal, and Kaushal Chaudhary — take responsibility for it. Balachauria was associated with our rivals Jaggu Khoti and Lawrence (Bishnoi). He sheltered the killer of Sidhu Moosewala and was involved himself. Today, by eliminating Rana, we avenged our brother Moosewala. This act was carried out by our brothers Makkhan Amritsar and Defaulter Karne.""The public murder led Opposition parties to questioning the state's law-and-order. Gurdaspur MP and former Punjab deputy CM Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa said: ""It exposes a serious failure of law and order in Punjab. When criminals act so brazenly, public safety is clearly at risk. The Bhagwant Mann govt must act immediately.""Phagwara MLA Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal, a former IAS officer, said: ""Enough is enough. Another sporting event in Punjab has been scarred by gun violence. The Mohali shooting is a glaring indictment of the state's collapsing law and order. When criminals can openly fire weapons at public events, how are ordinary citizens supposed to feel safe? This culture of armed impunity cannot be allowed to continue. The govt must act decisively to restore peace and public confidence.

NIA Names Pakistani Handler Sajid Jatt In Pahalgam Terror Attack Chargesheet

In A 1st, Lashkar Charged As A Legal Entity

Pahalgam mastermind listed as an individual 'terrorist' under UAPA

NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday filed a chargesheet in the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack case, naming Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT)/The Resistance Front (former's front) among seven accused. Sources said the LeT/TRF role was established after the origin of the two messages put out by TRF on its digital media platform, first claiming responsibility shortly after the attack, and the denial thereafter, were traced to Pakistan.The six other accused listed in the chargesheet, filed before the Special NIA court in Jammu, are top Lashkar mastermind and Pakistani handler Sajid Jatt; neutralised Pakistani attackers Faisal Jatt, alias Suleman Shah, who hailed from Pakistan Punjab, Habeeb Tahir, alias Jibran, from Rawlakote in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir and Abu Hamza; and arrested Kashmiri locals Parvaiz Ahmad and Bashir Ahmad Jothad, who had harboured the three Pakistani attackers days before the attack.The 1,597-page chargesheet records how NIA, through a meticulous probe spanning eight months, traced the Pahalgam attack conspiracy to Pakistan, ""which has been unabatedly sponsoring terrorism against India"".The links to Pakistan were confirmed by belongings and articles - IDs, M4 assault weapons and chocolates - recovered from the hideout of the three attackers who were killed in Operation Mahadev in July.This is perhaps the first time that LeT has been chargesheeted as a legal entity; earlier chargesheets filed in terror attacks launched by LeT, including the 26/11 Mumbai strikes, had named its top leaders, including chief Hafiz Mohammad Saeed and Sajid Jatt.There, however, are precedents of an 'unlawful association' like Popular Front of India (PFI) being chargesheeted by NIA.""The chargesheet, which details Pakistan's conspiracy, roles of the accused and supporting evidence in the case, has charged the banned LeT/TRF as a legal entity for its role in planning, facilitating and executing the Pahalgam attack,"" NIA said.TOI had on July 29 reported that Sajid Jatt, who leads TRF/LeT operations in Kashmir, had masterminded the Pahalgam attack as part of a closely-guarded ISI-LeT conspiracy to carry out a high-impact attack in Kashmir. Jatt was specifically instructed by ISI to only deploy foreign terrorists for the gruesome targeted killings on religious lines, while ensuring minimal involvement of local Kashmiris.Sajid Jatt, alias Saifullah, born on Sept 3, 1982, and hailing from Kasur, Pakistan, is listed as an individual 'terrorist' under the UAPA. He was the key handler of terrorists who killed five Indian soldiers in Bhata Dhurian, Poonch in 2023. LeT/TRF as well as the four Pakistani terrorists have been charged under provisions of BNS, Arms Act, and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, and for waging war against India. Parvaiz and Bashir had, following their arrest in June, disclosed identities of the attackers, confirming that the latter were Pakistani nationals affiliated to LeT. Sources had earlier told TOI that Parvaiz and Bashir were paid Rs 3,000 by the terrorists.",The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday filed a chargesheet in the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack case. NIA named Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT)/The Resistance Front (former's front) among seven accused.

Body-cam footage can be verified, says police officer

BENGALURU: A 21-year-old woman was seriously injured after allegedly jumping from the fourth floor of a hotel in AECS Layout, Kundalahalli, early Sunday, shortly after police arrived in response to a complaint of nuisance.The incident has sparked allegations of police misconduct, including claims of videography and a demand for a bribe, which the cops have denied. The injured woman, Monisha (name changed), a resident of Kundalahalli Colony & a BBA graduate employed with a private firm, is undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Marathahalli after sustaining multiple injuries.Police said a group of young men and women had checked into three rooms on the hotel’s 4th floor Saturday and allegedly consumed alcohol, played loud music and partied through the night.In the early hours of Sunday, they stepped onto a balcony and shouted, prompting another hotel guest to lodge a nuisance complaint. A Hoysala patrol vehicle from HAL police station was sent to the hotel, and police personnel questioned the occupants. In keeping with standard procedure, the interaction was recorded on the cops’ body-worn cameras. Police said Monisha came out of one of the rooms, noticed the cameras, ran towards the balcony and jumped.She landed on the iron grills of a neighbouring building’s compound wall and suffered grievous injuries. Her friends, with police assistance, moved her to a nearby private hospital, from where she was later moved to another facility.One of her friends alleged that police demanded a bribe, claiming this led to panic and the woman’s action. He told media that police tried to enter the rooms, began recording the interaction citing a nuisance complaint, and demanded cash while refusing UPI payment.Police, though, have denied the allegation, with a senior officer saying videography is mandatory during Hoysala patrol responses. He said the allegations would be verified through body-camera footage and action taken if any wrongdoing was found.Meanwhile, Monisha’s father has filed a complaint against the hotel, alleging negligence in ensuring balcony safety, and raised suspicion over her friends, hotel staff and police personnel who visited the spot. A case has been registered under BNS Section 125(b), and an investigation is under way, said DC K Parashurama.","A 21-year-old woman was seriously injured after allegedly jumping from the fourth floor of a hotel in Kundalahalli, early Sunday.

Trump Sparks Fury By Linking Rob Reiner’s Death To ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’; Son Nick In Custody



Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner deaths under investigation, son Nick Reiner charged





A quiet street in Brentwood, Los Angeles, turned loud and tense on Monday morning after reports surfaced about a shocking crime involving filmmaker Rob Reiner and his wife Michele Singer Reiner. According to the New York Post, social media influencers rushed to the scene just hours after news broke about an alleged double murder inside the couple’s home.Reporters at the location saw two men arrive in a black Tesla and park near the active police scene. One of them appeared to be livestreaming, blasting music and shouting to online followers while officers stood nearby. Police quickly stepped in and asked them to turn the music down.“Someone just died though,” the influencer said as officers moved closer. Another officer calmly replied, “Just keep it down, OK? That’s all we want legally.” The situation caused frustration for neighbors and journalists trying to report respectfully, the New York Post reported.One man at the scene claimed he was streamer Ice Poseidon, though it is unclear if he was the real online personality using that name. He wore a black sweatshirt and a gold Burger King crown while standing in front of the home.He repeatedly accused members of the media of touching his equipment, saying, “He touched my property and is invading my creative bubble.” No arrests were announced related to the disturbance.Behind the disorder outside was a far more serious and disturbing situation. TMZ reported that Rob Reiner, 78, and Michele Singer Reiner, 68, were found dead inside their home around 3:30 p.m. on Sunday, with their throats allegedly slashed. Authorities have not released an official public statement confirming the cause of death.According to TMZ, the couple’s 32-year-old son, Nick Reiner, has been charged and taken into custody. He was detained around 9:15 p.m. Sunday, the outlet reported. Their daughter, Romy Reiner, allegedly discovered the bodies and told police she believed a family member should be considered a suspect.Nick Reiner has spoken openly in the past about his struggles with addiction and homelessness. In a 2016 interview with People magazine, he said, “I was homeless in Maine. I was homeless in New Jersey. I was homeless in Texas.” He also shared that he entered rehab at 15 and went through many treatment programs.As of now, police say the Rob Reiner and wife’s investigation is ongoing. Officials have not shared full details, and the case remains active. Neighbors and fans alike are waiting for confirmed information as authorities continue their work.Also Read: What Really Happened Between Candace Owens And Erika Kirk?

Who were the shooters, Naveed Akram and Sajid Akram?





Explosives, weapons and terror links

The 'hero bystander'





'Pouring oil on the fire of antisemitism'









Sydney's Bondi Beach on Sunday evening saw Australia's deadliest mass shooting since the Port Arthur massacre, when a father–son duo opened fire on crowds at a Hanukkah event.At least 15 people, including a child, were killed as gunfire erupted from a pedestrian footbridge near Campbell Parade, triggering panic among locals and tourists gathered by the Sea.Police said 50-year-old Sajid Akram and his 24-year-old son, Naveed Akram, fired into the crowd from a raised pedestrian boardwalk overlooking the beach.Armed with long-barrelled guns, the attackers shot at people for nearly 10 minutes, triggering panic as crowds fled across the packed beachfront. As shots rang out, some people hid in nearby shops and buildings, while others sought cover behind beach facilities.Sajid Akram was shot dead in a gunfight with police at the scene, while Naveed was arrested and taken to hospital, where he remains in a critical but stable condition under police guard.Social media footage showed moments of bravery amid the terror, including a bystander who confronted one of the gunmen and wrestled a weapon away.By the time the area was secured, the beachfront was littered with discarded shoes, blankets and picnic items, stark reminders of the sudden violence that shattered across a grassy hill overlooking Bondi Beach.Prime Minister Albanese condemned the shooting, saying, “What we saw yesterday was an act of pure evil, an act of antisemitism, an act of terrorism on our shores,” as he laid flowers at the Bondi Pavilion.The alleged assailants were a father–son duo. The father, Sajid Akram originally hailed from Pakistan, CBS news reported. Police said investigations are ongoing but noted the attack was clearly intended to terrorise Australia’s Jewish community.Sajid, arrived in Australia in 1998 on a student visa, which was converted into a partner visa in 2001. He has since remained in the country on a resident return visa, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said. While Burke did not confirm Sajid’s country of origin, it has been widely reported that he immigrated from Pakistan.His son, Naveed Akram, is an Australian citizen born in 2001. Anthony Albanese said Naveed had come to the attention of Australia’s domestic intelligence agency, ASIO, in October 2019. However, after an assessment, authorities found “no indication of any ongoing threat or threat of him engaging in violence.”Albanese said ASIO’s 2019 assessment was triggered by concerns about Naveed’s associations at the time, rather than his own behaviour or character. “The assessment was made because of the son’s associations that he had, at that time, and the investigation went for a period of six months,” he said.According to The Sydney Morning Herald, Naveed was an unemployed bricklayer who lost his job around two months ago after his employer became insolvent.Naveed’s mother, Verena, said he had been actively looking for work. She described her son as quiet and not particularly social, adding that he did not spend much time online. Naveed, who attended Cabramatta High School, enjoyed activities such as fishing, scuba diving, swimming and exercising, she said.Despite his unemployment, Albanese reiterated that ASIO had assessed Naveed as posing no indication of a threat of violence, stressing again that earlier concerns were linked to his associates rather than his own conduct.Hours after the shooting, police found a homemade bomb in a car parked near the beach, saying the “improvised explosive device” had likely been planted by the attackers.The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported the attackers had possible links to the Islamic State group. An ISIS flag was also reportedly found inside the vehicle, ABC news said.Police recovered four firearms at the scene and later seized two more weapons from a rented room in Campsie.Naveed’s mother, Verena, said her son last contacted the family on Sunday morning, hours before the attack.“He rings me up [on Sunday] and said, Mum, I just went for a swim. I went scuba diving. We're going ... to eat now, and then this morning, and we're going to stay home now because it's very hot,” she told The Sydney Morning Herald, adding that he said he was in Jervis Bay with his father.She said she could not identify her son in images from the scene. “He doesn't have a firearm. He doesn't even go out. He doesn't mix around with friends. He doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke, he doesn't go to bad places ... he goes to work, he comes home, he goes to exercise, and that's it,” she said. “Anyone would wish to have a son like my son ... he's a good boy.”Amid the chaos, several bystanders rushed toward the danger to help victims. One man, identified by local media as fruit seller Ahmed el Ahmed, was seen in footage confronting one of the attackers.The 43-year-old wrestled a gun from the assailant and pointed it at him as he backed away. According to The Sydney Morning Herald, Ahmed’s cousin Jozay Alkanj said his relative feared for his life when the shooting began.“He was very scared [and said] I’m gonna die,” Alkanj recalled. “He said I’m going to die, please see my family [and tell them] that I went down to save people’s lives.”Speaking in Arabic outside the hospital, he said his son was in good spirits while awaiting surgery. “He said he thanks God that he was able to do this, to help innocent people and to save people from these monsters, these killers. He is a hero.”Ahmed’s father later described him as a hero. Speaking in Arabic outside the hospital, he said his son was in good spirits while awaiting surgery.“He said he thanks God that he was able to do this, to help innocent people and to save people from these monsters, these killers. He is a hero.”Australia lowered flags to half-mast to mourn the victims. Anthony Albanese said the government will push for tougher gun laws following the deadly antisemitic terror attack at Sydney’s Bondi Beach, signalling a possible tightening of Australia’s already strict firearms regime.Albanese said the issue would be taken up at a National Cabinet meeting, with the Prime Minister and state and territory leaders agreeing to pursue major changes to strengthen gun control and bring consistency across states after it emerged that one of the attackers legally owned six firearms.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Australia’s government of “pouring oil on the fire of antisemitism” in the months leading up to the attack.US President Donald Trump called it a “purely antisemitic attack.”Mass shootings have been rare in Australia since the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, which led to sweeping gun law reforms. However, Albanese said tougher gun laws may now be needed in the wake of the Bondi Beach attack.","At least 15 people, including a child, were killed as gunfire erupted from a pedestrian footbridge near Campbell Parade.

IndiGo to Indigo: How Goa Nightclub Owner Luthras' Midnight Escape Failed After Phuket Arrest

NEW DELHI: Goa nightclub owners Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, wanted in connection with the December 6 fire that claimed 25 lives, were sent back to India from Bangkok on an ""emergency certificate"" on Tuesday morning.As reported by TOI today, the duo boarded an Indigo flight and were likely to arrive at Delhi's IGI airport around 1.45 pm. The duo was spotted at the airport wearing masks and surrounded by immigration security officials.Upon arrival, they will be taken to the Patiala House Court by a team of Delhi crime branch and Goa Police, where their transit remand will be sought. The brothers will likely be flown to Goa by Tuesday night. Goa DGP Alok Kumar confirmed that the Luthras will arrive in Goa on Tuesday.A special team comprising CBI and intelligence officials landed in Phuket, Thailand, on Saturday to complete the deportation process. The brothers, detained from Indigo Hotel in Phuket, were then brought to the Bangkok detention centre. The Indian embassy in Thailand then issued an emergency certificate — a one-way travel document — to the Luthras since their passport was suspended by the Indian govt.The Luthras, who fled to Thailand hours after the fire while police and fire services were still battling the blaze and rescuing those trapped.They were subsequently detained last week by Thai authorities from Hotel Indigo in Patong, Phuket, and shifted to an immigration detention centre in Bangkok.The regional passport office, New Delhi, subsequently issued a notice to the brothers, seeking an explanation from both as to why action should not be initiated to impound their passports within seven days.Once a lookout notice was issued, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) decided to impound their passports, which meant that they were staying without valid travel documents in Thailand. India and Thailand signed a formal extradition treaty in 2013, which came into force on June 29, 2015.Goa police investigation into the fire incident at Birch revealed that over the past 18 months, the nightclub was operating illegally without permissions and on an expired licence. A senior police officer who is part of the investigation said that the instrument of licence was not renewed as the nightclub did not obtain permissions since 2024. However, despite these glaring lapses, not a single authority took action against Birch until the fire incident on the night of December 6.So far, Goa police have arrested Gurgaon resident Ajay Gupta, 55, a partner of brothers Saurabh and Gaurav, New Delhi natives Rajiv Modak, 49, chief general manager, and Priyanshu Thakur, 32, gate manager, along with UP natives Rajveer Singhania, 32, bar manager, Vivek Singh, 27, general manager, and Bharat Kohli from Delhi.When the fire broke out at the nightclub at around 11.45 pm on Saturday, there were more than 150 tourists attending an event. A preliminary investigation by police and the directorate of fire services concluded that the fire broke out after electric firecrackers struck the wooden ceiling during the event.",Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra were wanted in connection with the December 6 fire that claimed 25 lives.

GURGAON: A thick blanket of fog descended over NCR on Monday morning, triggering a spate of highway accidents that left six persons dead and several others injured. The series of collisions, including pileups on Delhi-Mumbai Expressway and Eastern Peripheral Expressway, occurred within hours of each other as visibility dropped to near zero early morning, catching motorists off guard and paralysing traffic.The first accident occurred near Raniyala Patakpur village on Delhi-Mumbai Expressway in Nuh, where at least 20 vehicles, including two trucks, were involved in a chain of collisions. Among the victims was CISF inspector Harish Kumar (38) from Ambedkar Nagar in Rajasthan’s Alwar district, who died when his vehicle crashed into another in front. Khalil (45) of Jaipur also died when his car became entangled in the pile-up. Five others were injured and taken to Mandi Kheda hospital, where police confirmed their condition was stable.Cops agreed that the accident was caused by dense fog that enveloped the highway, drastically reducing visibility. “Yes, the accident occurred due to extremely low visibility caused by dense fog. Multiple vehicles failed to notice those ahead in time and collided with each other,” a police officer said.Emergency teams and highway authorities responded quickly, clearing the wreckage with cranes and restoring traffic flow without prolonged congestion.Elsewhere on the expressway — near Banarsi village — seven to eight vehicles were caught in another collision. While several vehicles were damaged, there were no injuries. A third accident occurred on Delhi-Alwar Road near Ghaseda village, where a Haryana Roadways bus collided with a tractor. Police confirmed there were no casualties, though both vehicles suffered significant damage.The hazardous conditions extended beyond Nuh. In Faridabad, a Ford Endeavour crashed into a stationary truck onDelhi-Mumbai Expressway near Kail village. Sandeep (32) and Vishal (24), both from Jaipur, died before they could wheeled into a hospital. Vishal’s driver, Harsh, who suffered grievous injuries to his eyes, succumbed during treatment. Police said the truck was parked after exiting the expressway, and the impact left one side of the SUV completely crushed. A case was registered against the truck driver under relevant sections of BNS.Gurgaon city wasn’t spared either. On Southern Peripheral Road, a car collided with another vehicle around 7am, while a similar accident occurred on Golf Course Extension Road, where a car crashed into a cab. On KMP Expressway, a truck struck a stationary heavy vehicle. Fortunately, no injuries werereported in these accidents, which were also caused by dense fog.On the other side of NCR — in Noida — at least 20 vehicles were involved in two incidents of pileups on Eastern Peripheral Expressway, leading to the death of a 24-year old truck driver. According to police, 13 others were injured in the accidents in Ecotech 1 area. The accidents, officials said, occurred merely 500 metres apart near Attai village. “Due to dense fog, 20 vehicles collided at both locations. The occupants of one car that crashed into another suffered injuries. Most of them were sent home from hospital after receiving first aid,” said Arvind Verma, the Ecotech-1 police station in-charge.","At least 20 vehicles, including two trucks, were involved in a chain of collisions on Delhi-Mumbai Expressway in Nuh.

Bondi Beach attack: What we know





Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok is spreading misinformation about the Bondi Beach attack in Sydney, reports Gizmodo. The shooting which killed at least sixteen people at a Hanukkah gathering is one of the deadliest mass shootings in decades. As per the report, Grok has been glitching since Sunday (December 14) morning, responding to user questions with unrelated or sometimes incorrect answers. When one user asked Grok to explain the video showing Al Ahmed – one of the assailants tackling the shooter, the AI responded with an incorrect claim.“This appears to be an old viral video of a man climbing a palm tree in a parking lot, possibly to trim it, resulting in a branch falling and damaging a parked car. Searches across sources show no verified location, date, or injuries. It may be staged; authenticity is uncertain,” the AI chatbot said.But the glitch does not end here.

Roblox on Russia ban





Russia recently banned US gaming platform Roblox stating it was ""rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children"". According to a report by news agency Reuters, several people protested against the ban in the Siberian city of Tomsk. The protestors were reportedly holding up hand-drawn placards reading ""Hands off Roblox"" and ""Roblox is the victim of the digital Iron Curtain"" in Vladimir Vysotsky Park.The publication claims to have seen photos from the protest which showed about 25 people standing in a circle in the snow, holding up placards. ""Bans and blocks are all you are able to do,"" read one placard.Moscow currently bans social media platforms such as Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram , WhatsApp and YouTube. Russia's communications watchdog Roskomnadzor announced the Roblox ban on December 13, triggering a debate over censorship, child safety in relation to technology and even the effectiveness of censorship in a digitalised world where children can bypass many bans in a few clicks.The ban can easily be circumvented by using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). As per the report, some young Russians have questioned the logic of a ban if it can be so easily bypassed while others have questioned why there are so few Russian alternatives to the apps which the state has banned.Russia is not the only country that has banned Roblox. The company headquartered in San Mateo, California, has been banned by several countries including Iraq and Turkey over concerns about predators exploiting the platform to abuse children. Some Russian parents and teachers, as reported by Reuters, have said they were concerned Roblox allowed children to access sexual content and communicate with adults.Commenting on the Russian ban, Roblox said it has ""a deep commitment to safety"" and provides ""rigorous built-in protections to help keep users safe"".","Russia recently banned US gaming platform Roblox stating it was ""rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children"" Several people protested against the ban in the Siberian city of Tomsk.

Trump Seizes 'Largest Oil Tanker' Off Venezuela; Daredevil Operation or Theft? | Dramatic Video





The US military has carried out what it described as a “lethal kinetic strike” against three suspected drug-trafficking vessels in international waters in the eastern Pacific, killing eight people, according to US Southern Command.The operation, conducted on December 15 under the direction of Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, marks the latest escalation in Washington’s aggressive maritime campaign against what it calls narco-terrorist networks operating in the region.Southern Command said Joint Task Force Southern Spear targeted three boats travelling along known narcotics routes. Intelligence assessments concluded the vessels were actively engaged in drug trafficking and operated by organisations designated by the US as terrorist groups. Three men were killed on the first vessel, two on the second and three on the third, the command said, adding that all those killed were “male narco-terrorists”.The strike comes against the backdrop of a wider US pressure campaign in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, particularly focused on Venezuela. In recent months, US naval forces have expanded their presence in the region, alongside sanctions and high-profile seizures of vessels accused of transporting illicit oil and drugs. US officials say the operations are aimed at disrupting networks that fund armed groups and hostile regimes through narcotics and smuggling.",US military carried out what it described as a ‘lethal kinetic strike’ against three suspected drug-trafficking vessels in international waters in the eastern Pacific.

Putin’s Men ‘CHANGE’ Front With New Capture, KILL 1450+ Ukraine Troops As Berlin Talks Struggle





US president Donald Trump on Monday said a peace deal to end the four-year-long war between Ukraine and Russia is “closer than ever,” citing ongoing talks between European leaders and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin.Trump said the United States is receiving “tremendous support” from European countries, including Germany, Italy, France, the UK, Poland, Norway, Denmark, Finland, and the Netherlands, all of which he said are keen to see an end to the conflict.""We are going to get it done. I think we are closer now, and they will tell you that they are closer now with numerous conversations with President Putin of Russia. And I think we are closer now than we have ever been... We want to save a lot of lives,"" Trump said, speaking at the White House. ""We are getting closer. We are having tremendous support from European leaders that want to get it ended also,"" he added.The US President also acknowledged the difficulty of bringing Russia and Ukraine into agreement on both the timing and the terms of a potential settlement. Trump added that while he has expressed optimism in the past, his expectations have previously been undermined by setbacks from one side or the other.""At this moment, Russia wants to get it, but the problem is they will want to end it, and all of a sudden they want it, and Ukraine will want to get it ended and all of a sudden they won't. We have to get them on the same page,"" Trump said.The assessment followed two days of talks in Berlin involving officials from Europe, Ukraine and the United States. Trump was represented at the discussions by his foreign envoy, Steve Witkoff, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.Trump also joined a dinner of European leaders by phone on Monday to discuss the emerging framework of an agreement, and held two separate calls with Witkoff and Kushner as the talks progressed.“Things are seemingly going well, but we’ve been saying that for a long time, and it’s a difficult one,” Trump had said after the call.A US official said earlier on Monday that around 90 per cent of the issues between Russia and Ukraine have been resolved, with territorial concessions remaining a key point of contention. The official added that the US had put forward “thought-provoking” proposals to break the deadlock, including the creation of an “economic free zone,” as cited by CNN.European leaders, meanwhile, have agreed to participate in any Western security guarantees for Ukraine, though control over territory continues to be one of the main obstacles, according to Al Jazeera.Separately, Ukrainian Zelenskyy has previously indicated that Kyiv is prepared to relinquish its bid for Nato membership in exchange for firm security assurances from Western partners.Discussions this week also covered plans for Ukraine’s reconstruction, with representatives from investment firm BlackRock holding talks with Ukrainian officials on potential financial support. The future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was also raised, though the issue remains unresolved.Meanwhile, overnight Russian forces launched 153 drones at Ukraine, according to Ukrainian officials, who said 17 of them reached their targets.

BBC’s response so far

What the edited clip showed?





US President Donald Trump on Monday filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the BBC, accusing Britain’s public service broadcaster of misleadingly editing a speech he delivered to supporters in Washington on January 6, 2021, shortly before the US Capitol was stormed, news agency AP reported.The January 2021 attack on the US Capitol sought to block Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election. Trump has repeatedly denied responsibility for the violence.According to Reuters, the lawsuit was filed in federal court in Miami. Trump has alleged that edited clips aired by the BBC falsely suggested he urged supporters to storm the Capitol, causing him serious reputational and financial damage.Trump claims the broadcaster stitched together excerpts from different parts of his speech including remarks urging supporters to march to the Capitol and another in which he said “fight like hell” — while excluding a passage calling for peaceful protest. He argues that the edit created a misleading impression of a direct call for violence.The BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit, according to The Guardian.However, the broadcaster has previously apologised, conceding an “error of judgment”, and acknowledged that the edit gave a mistaken impression. It has maintained that there is no legal basis for a defamation claim.In a statement issued earlier, a BBC spokesperson said lawyers had replied to Trump’s legal notice, adding: “While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.”The disputed clip featured in an episode of Panorama broadcast shortly before the 2024 US presidential election. The controversy triggered one of the biggest crises in the BBC’s 103-year history and led to the resignations of director general Tim Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness last month, The Guardian reported. The broadcaster has said it does not intend to rebroadcast the documentary on any of its platforms.According to The Guardian, the edit drawn from sections of Trump’s speech delivered almost an hour apart gave the impression that he told the crowd: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.”A spokesperson for Trump’s legal team said the edited footage, aired in the run-up to the 2024 election, amounted to a “brazen attempt” to interfere in the contest. “The BBC has a long pattern of deceiving its audience in coverage of President Trump, all in service of its own leftist political agenda,” the spokesperson said. “President Trump’s powerhouse lawsuit is holding the BBC accountable for its defamation and reckless election interference. ”The row intensified after the leak of a BBC memo by an external editorial standards adviser, which raised concerns over how the programme had been edited as part of a wider review into alleged political bias at the publicly funded broadcaster. The documentary was not aired in the United States.Trump’s lawyers argue that the BBC acted “intentionally, maliciously, and deceptively”. In the filing, Trump is seeking damages of at least $10 billion.Speaking earlier to reporters, Trump said: “We’ll sue them for anywhere between $1bn and $5bn probably sometime next week. I think I have to do it. They cheated. They changed the words coming out of my mouth,” as quoted by the BBC. In a separate interview, he said: “I think I have an obligation to do it. If you don’t do it, you don’t stop it from happening again with other people.”Legal experts cited by Reuters say Trump faces a high legal threshold under US law. As a public figure, he must prove not only that the edit was false and defamatory, but also that the BBC knowingly misled viewers or acted with reckless disregard for the truth, given strong constitutional protections for free speech and the press.The BBC is expected to argue that the programme was substantially accurate, that its editing did not materially distort the meaning of the speech, or that Trump’s reputation was not harmed. In the UK, defamation claims must be filed within a year of publication, a deadline that has passed for the Panorama episode which may explain why Trump has chosen to sue in the US.Trump’s lawsuit argues that the Florida court has jurisdiction because the BBC conducts “substantial” business in the state, including through its website and the BritBox streaming service, which operates in the US.The case adds to a series of legal actions Trump has brought against media organisations. While CBS and ABC have settled lawsuits with him following his 2024 election victory, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and an Iowa newspaper have denied wrongdoing in cases filed against them.","US President Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the BBC.

In a key development in the Brown University shooting case, authorities have identified a 24-year-old man as a person of interest.Benjamin Erickson, a 24-year-old man, was arrested before dawn on Sunday, at a Hampton Inn in Coventry, Rhode Island, following an 11-hour manhunt, New York Post reported.He was sought in connection with a mass shooting at Brown University’s Providence campus during a final-exam study session on Saturday around 4.30 pm. Two students were killed and nine more wounded when the gunman opened fire.Police said Erickson was not a current student but investigators were examining whether he had studied at Brown or had other ties to the institution. He was being held as a person of interest; no charges had been filed.According to the records, Erickson served in the US Army.He served as an infantryman in the US Army from May 2021 to November 2024, leaving the military with the rank of specialist, an Army rep told The Post.His voter registration showing a “statehood” party affiliation, according to public records.Law-enforcement officials said the shooter was armed with a handgun and fired more than 40 9 mm rounds. CCTV footage showed a man matching his description walking along a road near the campus before the attack.Shell casings were marked with evidence tags inside the building where the shooting took place.Investigators were also probing whether Erickson had long-standing mental-health issues, sources said. “The man told authorities he had been in his room the entire time Saturday when the shooting took place,” CNN said.The motive remained unclear. Erickson did not immediately appear to have any criminal history, according to public records.A revolver and a small handgun fitted with a special laser light were found in his hotel room, sources and CNN reported. Sources told The Post that the unique laser light on the handgun helped lead them to the person of interest.The FBI’s Cellular Analysis Survey team geolocated Erickson to the Coventry hotel, according to agency director Kash Patel. Police also used video evidence, tips from the public, an examination of license-plate readers and other leads to track him, CNN said.The shooting occurred around 4.30 pm during a final exam review session for an economics class run by Rachel Friedberg, who also served as a faculty associate of the school’s Programme in Judaic Studies.One victim remained in critical condition, seven were listed as stable and one had been discharged, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley told reporters on Sunday morning.“We continue to be in mourning as a community about the tragic loss of life from gun violence that stole the lives of two of our students yesterday,” Brown University President Christina Paxson said in a statement. “The past 24 hours really have been unimaginable — it’s a tragedy that no university community is ever ready for. While we always prepare for major crises, we also pray such a day never comes” she added.A shelter-in-place order was lifted on the campus, although all final exams were cancelled. “At this time, it is essential that we focus our efforts on providing care and support to the members of our community as we grapple with the sorrow, fear and anxiety that is impacting all of us right now,” school Provost Francis J. Doyle III said in a message.US President Trump also mourned the victims, speaking at a White House Christmas event shortly before a mass shooting in Australia’s Bondi Beach. “I want to just pay my respects to the people, unfortunately, two are no longer with us, Brown University, nine injured, and two are looking down on us right now from Heaven,” Trump said.A candlelight vigil was held for the victims at Lippitt Memorial on Sunday instead of the town’s holiday light celebration, Providence Councilwoman Sue AnderBois said as hundreds gathered. “We are gathered here to share light with one another in one of Providence’s darkest times,” she said.“Our hearts break for the two students at Brown who lost their lives to gun violence yesterday, and the nine others who are injured, and their families and the whole Brown and Greater Providence community.","Benjamin Erickson, a 24-year-old man, was arrested before dawn on Sunday, at a Hampton Inn in Coventry, Rhode Island.

Lukashenko has ruled the nation of 9.5 million with an iron fist for more than three decades, and the country has been repeatedly sanctioned by Western countries both for its crackdown on human rights and for allowing Moscow to use its territory in the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Belarus has released hundreds of prisoners since July 2024.John Coale, the U.S. special envoy for Belarus, made the announcement after meeting the country's authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko in the Belarusian capital of Minsk on Friday and Saturday.A close ally of Russia, Minsk has faced Western isolation and sanctions for years. Lukashenko has ruled the nation of 9.5 million with an iron fist for more than three decades, and the country has been repeatedly sanctioned by Western countries both for its crackdown on human rights and for allowing Moscow to use its territory in the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Speaking with journalists, Coale described the two-day talks as ""very productive,"" Belarus' state news agency Belta reported Saturday.The U.S. envoy said that normalizing relations between Washington and Minsk was ""our goal.""""We're lifting sanctions, releasing prisoners. We're constantly talking to each other,"" he said, according to Belta. He also said that the relationship between the countries was moving from ""baby steps to more confident steps"" as they increased dialogue.The last time U.S. officials met with Lukashenko in September 2025, Washington announced easing some of the sanctions against Belarus while Mink released more than 50 political prisoners into Lithuania. Overall, Belarus released more than 430 political prisoners since July 2024, in what was widely seen as an effort at a rapprochement with the West.Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya told The Associated Press on Saturday that sanctions relief was part of a deal between Minsk and Washington, in which another large group of political prisoners in Belarus were expected to be released.""The freeing of political prisoners means that Lukashenko understands the pain of Western sanctions and is seeking to ease them,"" Tsikhanouskaya said.She added: ""But let's not be naive: Lukashenko hasn't changed his policies, his crackdown continues and he keeps on supporting Russia's war against Ukraine. That's why we need to be extremely cautious with any talk of sanctions relief, so that we don't reinforce Russia's war machine and encourage continued repressions.""Tsikhnouskaya also described European Union sanctions against Belarusian potash fertilizers as far more painful for Minsk that those imposed by the U.S, saying that while easing U.S. sanctions could lead to the release of political prisoners, European sanctions should push for longterm, systemic changes in Belarus and the end of Russia's war in Ukraine.The latest round discussions also touched on Venezuela, as well as Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, Belta said.Coale told reporters that Lukashenko had given ""good advice"" on how to address the conflict, saying that Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin were ""longtime friends"" with ""the necessary level of relationship to discuss such issues.""""Naturally, President Putin may accept some advice and not others,"" Coale said.","John Coale, the U.S. special envoy for Belarus, made the announcement after meeting the country's authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko in the Belarusian capital of Minsk on Friday and Saturday.

Bondi Beach shooting : 11 dead, shooters seized





As panic spread across Sydney’s Bondi Beach during a deadly shooting at a Hanukkah celebration, one man put his life on the line to stop the gunfire.His name is Ahmed al Ahmed, a 43-year-old fruit shop owner who is now being hailed as a hero for tackling and disarming one of the attackers. The heroic act was caught on camera and went viral following the shooting.Ahmed is a father of two from Sydney’s south. He was walking past the area when two gunmen opened fire near the Chanukah By The Sea, a Jewish celebration on Sunday. The gathering was held near a children’s playground and hundreds of families were there for the event.Footage online shows Ahmed, dressed in a white shirt, crouching behind parked cars as shots ring out. At the right moment, he rushed forward and grabbed one of the gunmen from behind, placing him in a headlock. After a violent struggle lasting several seconds, Ahmed wrestles the shotgun from the attacker, forcing him to retreat.In the video, Ahmed can later be seen sitting on the ground as bystanders rush to help him. A towel is brought to stop the bleeding from his leg. He was shot twice. Despite being wounded, he remains conscious and places the seized weapon against a tree.His cousin, Mustafa, spoke to 7News and said Ahmed was undergoing treatment in the hospital.“He’s in hospital and we don’t know exactly what’s going on inside,” Mustafa said. “We do hope he will be fine. He’s a hero 100 per cent.”Ahmed was reportedly due to undergo surgery and had no prior experience handling firearms. According to family members, he acted out of instinct to protect others.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the heroic act, describing it as “the pinnacle of Jewish heroism”.Police said two shooters were involved in the attack. One was shot dead at the scene, while the other was critically injured and taken into custody.Moments after Ahmed disarmed the first attacker, police moved in. An officer approached from behind the bridge and shot the remaining gunman dead. Separate footage later showed officers administering CPR to one of the suspects.At least 11 were killed in the attack.

Australia was rocked by one of its deadliest mass shootings in decades after a Pakistani-origin father and son opened fire at Sydney’s Bondi Beach, killing 16, including gunman, during a Jewish festival.The shooting has been declared a ""terrorist incident"", with two Islamic State (IS) flags being recovered during subsequent raids, ABC news reported.Authorities identified the assailants as a 50-year-old father and his 24-year-old son. The father was shot dead by police at the scene, while the son was taken to hospital with critical injuries. Police said the father legally owned six firearms, believed to have been used in the attack.Australian PM Anthony Albanese has proposed ""tougher gun laws"" saying, ""The government is prepared to take whatever action is necessary. Included in that is the need for tougher gun laws.""The two suspected gunmen behind were identified as a father and his son, authorities said. The 50-year-old father, Sajid Akram, was shot dead by police at the scene, while his 24-year-old son, Naveed Akram, was critically injured and remains hospitalised, CBS news cited New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon saying.Moreover, investigators believe that the duo had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) group. Two IS flags were recovered from their car parked near Bondi Beach, with footage from the scene showing one flag placed on the vehicle’s bonnet, ABC news cited senior officials saying.Australia’s domestic intelligence agency ASIO had previously examined Naveed Akram about six years ago due to his close links with a Sydney-based IS terror cell. He was reportedly connected to Isaak El Matari, an IS operative arrested in 2019 and later jailed for plotting an insurgency in Australia. ASIO director-general Mike Burgess confirmed that one of the attackers was known to the agency, though not assessed as an immediate threat at the time.The shooting unfolded on a Sunday afternoon at Bondi Beach, where more than 1,000 people had gathered to celebrate Hanukkah. Armed with long-barrelled guns, the attackers indiscriminately targeted crowds at the popular tourist hotspot.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed the Australian government and accused it of ""pouring oil on the fire of antisemitism"" in the period leading up to the shooting.""Antisemitism is a cancer that spreads when leaders are silent and do not act,"" AFP quoted him saying.Armed with long-barrelled guns, the father-and-son attackers opened fire on the packed tourist hotspot, triggering scenes of panic as families and visitors ran for safety, leaving behind belongings scattered across the sand.As shots rang out, some people hid in nearby shops and buildings, while others sought cover behind beach facilities. Social media footage showed moments of bravery amid the terror, including a bystander who confronted one of the gunmen and wrestled a weapon away. Police quickly responded, shooting dead the older attacker at the scene, while his son was critically injured.By the time the area was secured, the beachfront was littered with discarded shoes, blankets and picnic items, stark reminders of the sudden violence that shattered a festive afternoon.Australian authorities declared the act a ""terrorist incident"", with PM Anthony Albanese condemning it as ""pure evil"".""What we saw yesterday was an act of pure evil, an act of antisemitism, an act of terrorism on our shores in an iconic Australian location, Bondi Beach, that is associated with joy, associated with families gathering, associated with celebrations,"" AFP quoted Albanese saying.""It is forever tarnished by what has occurred last evening,"" he added.","Authorities identified the assailants as a father and his 24-year-old son.

Drug addiction to homeless: Meet Nick Reiner







What began as an awkward meltdown at a Hollywood Christmas party reportedly ended in one of the industry’s most horrifying family tragedies.Just hours after a volatile blow-up at Conan O’Brien’s holiday gathering, Rob Reiner’s troubled son Nick allegedly turned on the two people who had spent decades trying to save him. Friends say the famed director left the party shaken and fearful after Nick’s erratic behavior alarmed guests and reignited long-running fears about his spiraling mental health and relapse into drugs.By the next day, police say those fears had turned into a nightmare, with Rob Reiner and his wife, photographer Michele Singer Reiner, found brutally slain inside their Los Angeles home.The police alleged that their son Nick Reiner, the 49-year-old, murdered his parents on Sunday at their Los Angeles mansion after a “very loud argument’’ at the party on Saturday, pals said. He is accused of fatally slitting their throats and stabbing them multiple times.The argument at the party reportedly erupted because Nick, who had at least 17 stints in rehab since age 15, was back on drugs and refused yet another course of treatment, sources told The Post. “Nick was freaking everyone out, acting crazy, kept asking people if they were famous,’’ a source told People magazine. Friends said Rob and Michele left the gathering terrified of what their son might do next.A lifelong family friend who lives near the Reiner home told The Post, “They had had an argument at Conan’s holiday party, and Rob had been telling people that they’re scared for Nick and scared that his mental state was deteriorating.’’ The neighbour added, “Nick was supposedly off drugs,” but then talk surfaced that he was “not so much off them.” At his lowest point, he was “badly addicted to a combo of opiates and heroin,” the neighbour said.Another friend said, “I know [the parents] wanted him to get help, go to rehab, but he wanted to get help while at home — he did not want to get treatment at a facility. And I know they have argued about that for years.’’Nick’s sister, Romy, 28, a magazine writer and aspiring actress, discovered their parents’ bodies at around 3.40 pm on Sunday. She told investigators that her brother “should be a suspect’’ because he is “dangerous,’’ sources said. He was arrested hours later and charged with murder. He was held without bail and placed on suicide watch.Nick’s previous public outburst came months earlier at the Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Santa Monica Canyon, where he screamed at his father in front of other diners.Rob and Michele also had a son, Jake, 34, who worked as a TV reporter in Houston and hosted a podcast on the LA Dodgers. Rob had previously been married to former sitcom star Penny Marshall and adopted her daughter, Tracy Marshall Reiner. Tracy, 61, told NBC News on Monday, “I came from the greatest family ever. I don’t know what to say. I’m in shock.”The last public appearance of the family came on Sept. 9, when Nick, Romy, Jake and their parents walked the red carpet at the Spinal Tap II: The End Continues premiere at the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles.Nick had battled drug addiction for more than half his life, at times ending up broke and homeless. In 2015, he founded an environmental non-profit called Save Malibu, but it did not last a year.A cast member on his semi-autobiographical 2015 film Being Charlie, which Rob directed to help his son, said, “These poor people did everything to help this kid. [Nick’s] a nepo-baby, a spoiled kid to the tee.” Stunt performer Erik Audé told Page Six, “You could tell [Nick] was spoiled and Rob was just sick of his s–t. I just assumed, whether this is correct or not, this kid must be pushing all his buttons. Rob can’t do anything right. ”A family friend said, “This is not the first time their son has been violent. I know of another incident a few years back with Nick, but I won’t say more than that. I just never thought it would ever get to this point. It is such a nightmare.’’In 2018, Nick admitted on the Dopey podcast, “It’s not much of a story. I got totally spun out on uppers — I think it was coke and something else — and I was up for days on end. I started punching out some things in my guest house.”A former classmate of Nick’s told The Post, “instantly knew’’ he was the suspect when she heard the news. A security guard hired to patrol the Brentwood community told The Post that Nick had been living with his parents for at least a year. “You could tell something was a little off with him,’’ the guard, Trevor Taufahema, said. “He’s a strange individual, you know? I’m not sure who [the friend] was, but I’d always see [Nick] sneak off with him. I don’t know what they were doing.”The murders shocked the film-making community. Kathy Bates, who starred in Reiner’s 1990 film Misery, said, “I’m horrified hearing this terrible news. Absolutely devastated.” Fellow director Ron Howard tweeted, “He proved to be a superlative filmmaker, a supportive colleague and at all times a dedicated citizen.”","Nick Reiner, 49, is accused of murdering his parents, Rob and Michele, at their Los Angeles mansion on Sunday.

Trump signs executive order reclassifying fentanyl as weapon of mass destruction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-signs-executive-order-reclassifying-fentanyl-as-weapon-of-mass-destruction/articleshow/125993028.cms,"



President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday at the White House in Washington, declaring fentanyl a weapon of mass destruction, dramatically expanding the US government’s authority to fight the synthetic opioid blamed for tens of thousands of American overdose deaths each year.The designation, unprecedented for a narcotic, signalled Trump’s intent to treat fentanyl not merely as a public health crisis but as a national security threat on a par with chemical warfare.The classification empowers the Pentagon to assist law enforcement and allows intelligence agencies to deploy against drug traffickers the tools normally reserved for countering weapons proliferation.""We're formally classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, which is what it is,"" Trump said at a White House event honouring servicemembers tasked with helping to police the U.S. southern border with Mexico. ""They're trying to drug out our country.""""Illicit fentanyl is closer to a chemical weapon than a narcotic,"" Trump’s order said.Trump’s designation of drug cartels this year as foreign terrorist organisations opened the door to military action against them. Since early September, the Trump administration carried out more than 20 strikes against suspected drug vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific, killing more than 80 people.Legal experts say the strikes may be illegal. There has been little or no proof made public that the boats were carrying drugs or that it was necessary to destroy them rather than stop them, seize their cargo and question those on board.A Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Wednesday found that a broad swath of Americans oppose the U.S. military’s campaign of deadly strikes on the boats, including about one-fifth of Trump’s Republicans.Trump has repeatedly threatened strikes on land in Venezuela, Colombia and Mexico to battle drug trafficking. In a sweeping strategy document published last week, Trump said his administration’s foreign policy focus would be on reasserting U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere.Mexico is the largest source of U.S.-bound illicit fentanyl. Many of the chemicals used to manufacture the drug are sourced from China. The opioid is a leading cause of U.S. overdose deaths.","President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday at the White House in Washington, declaring fentanyl a weapon of mass destruction.

Indian American political leaders have called for stronger gun safety measures following a deadly shooting at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, that left two people dead and eight others injured. The attack took place on 14 December and prompted widespread condemnation and renewed debate over gun violence in the US.California Representative Ro Khanna described the incident as a “horrific mass shooting” and said repeated failures to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation continue to have deadly consequences. He added that Congress has debated gun reform for years without decisive action, despite broad public concern over mass shootings. Khanna said the Brown University attack once again shows the urgency of addressing gun violence at the federal level.Washington Representative Pramila Jayapal echoed those concerns, saying the frequency of mass shootings across the country should compel lawmakers to move beyond statements and towards concrete reforms. She said the US has seen too many such attacks in schools and public spaces, underscoring the scale of the problem.Jayapal added that legislative action is essential to reduce the risk of future violence and protect communities.Illinois Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi also expressed solidarity with the Brown University community, offering condolences to the victims and their families while urging Congress to take action to address gun violence. He said incidents like the Brown University shooting highlight the need for bipartisan efforts to reduce gun-related deaths and injuries. Krishnamoorthi added that protecting students and public spaces should remain a priority for lawmakers.The shooting occurred on the eve of the anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School attack, adding to the significance of the moment for advocates of gun reform.

Republican senator Eric Schmitt took to social media to slam the Democratic states that are trying to block the Trump administration's H1-B crackdown.In a lengthy post on X, Schmitt described how each Blue state is using the visa programme for certain reasons and hence trying to block the GOP crackdown.The MAGA senator said: ""20 Democrat states are suing the Trump Administration to block its H-1B visa crackdown. These states claim they need H-1Bs to import skilled foreign workers. But let's take a look at how they're actually using these visas.""Schmitt first attacked Blue stronghold and Gavin Newsom's territory of California. He said that California's AG, Rob Bonta, accused the Trump administration of trying to ""shut out the skilled workers America depends on.""Schmitt said that California has been the site of some of the most ""egregious H-1B abuse.""He used the example of Southern California Edison: Hundreds of US tech workers were laid off and then forced to train their H-1B replacements just to receive their severance package.One laid-off American worker said: ""They told us they could replace one of us with three, four, or five Indian personnel and still save money.

The Republican claimed that motorcycle manufacturer Harley Davidson, headquartered in Milwaukee, has been sued in federal court for partnering with Indian outsourcing firms to lay off Wisconsin IT workers and force them to train their H-1B replacements.Like other Blue strongholds, Eric said that multiple major companies in Connecticut have fired American tech workers in high numbers and forced them to train their H-1B replacements.Eric claimed that one laid-off American in Connecticut was forced to train 10 additional workers back in India via web conferencing.Schmitt said that Illinois is ""another plaintiff."" He claimed that Illinois' Democratic senator Dick Durbin has been pushing for H-1B reform for decades.The US workers who were fired in the state put American flags outside their cubicles in protest before they left.Eric said that New Jersey is ""home to Toys ""R"" Us, which brought in H-1B workers from India to shadow employees for weeks (even following them to the restroom) so the foreign workers could create manuals on how to do the jobs themselves.

US President Donald Trump announced Monday (local time) his plan to classify fentanyl as a ""weapon of mass destruction"" to strengthen his campaign against drug smuggling Trump made this announcement in the Oval Office while presenting medals to US troops who patrolled the US-Mexican border.""There's no doubt that America's adversaries are trafficking fentanyl into the United States in part because they want to kill Americans. If this were a war, that would be one of the worst wars,"" Trump said.The president drew parallels between current fentanyl smuggling and historical events. Fentanyl has claimed nearly 330,000 American lives in the five-year period ending in April.""You can look throughout history. Look at China, when they were loaded up with drugs, they were suffering greatly, and others were able to take them over. And other countries also, they're trying to drug out our country,"" Trump said.The specific implications of the new classification were not immediately detailed, though it could lead to harsher criminal penalties for traffickers.Trump acknowledged that fentanyl, which can be lethal in small doses, has legitimate medical uses. The drug is commonly smuggled through the Mexican border or international mail and shipping systems.The announcement follows Trump's October meeting with Xi Jinping, who made commitments to combat fentanyl trafficking.

FBI foiled a suspected New Year's Eve terror plot in California, releasing surveillance footage of the extremists just before their arrest.Four alleged members of a far-left pro-Palestinian anti-government group called the Turtle Island Liberation Front were apprehended last week while travelling east of Los Angeles to test improvised explosive devices (IEDs), officials said.The group is suspected of planning coordinated bomb attacks at at least five locations across the region.US Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on X that authorities prevented ""far-left"" extremists from executing ""a massive and horrific terror plot"".The suspects were identified as: Audrey Illeene Carroll, 30; Zachary Aaron Page, 32; Dante Gaffield, 24; and Tina Lai, 41.The quad face charges, including conspiracy and possession of an unregistered destructive device, according to a complaint filed in the US District Court for the Central District of California.Officials said the group travelled to the desert with ""precursor chemicals"" on December 12, intending to build bombs. A surveillance plane captured their movements, and the FBI and Los Angeles SWAT team arrested the quartet without incident.The plot reportedly targeted two logistics centres at midnight on New Year's Eve. The group also allegedly discussed attacking Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and vehicles in January or February.One of the extremists, Carroll, allegedly said: ""That would take some of them out and scare the rest of them.""LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell praised the coordinated effort.
