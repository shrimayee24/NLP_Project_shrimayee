"Buy only from Sanatanis, says Akhara Parishad",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/buy-only-from-sanatanis-says-akhara-parishad/articleshow/114100291.cms,"PRAYAGRAJ: The Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad ( ABAP ) has instructed mahamandaleshwars, mandaleshwars and seers across the country, as well as devotees and followers, to buy goods from shopkeepers who are ""followers of Sanatan dharma "", and engage only Hindu barbers, carpenters, cobblers and other service providers.Goods should be bought only from a shop that had a board displaying the owner's name, and after verifying if there was an idol or picture of gods and goddesses inside the shop, dhaba, restaurant or any other establishment, the Parishad further said.This was necessary because ""people of a particular religion"" were acting with malicious intent, it alleged. Food, drinks and even flowers, prasad and other items used by Hindus during worship were being sold after spitting on them. Vegetables and fruits were dipped in dirty water before being sold. Many such cases had come to light across the country through videos shared on social media, the Akhara Parishad said.In view of such cases, the parishad had decided to change its path in the upcoming Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj, said ABAP president Mahant Ravindra Puri, hinting at a boycott of Muslim shopkeepers.""In Maha Kumbh, bhandaras are organised in the camps of seers of all sects. For these bhandaras, apart from Hindus, Sikh, Jain and Buddhist shopkeepers have been identified in Prayagraj for fruits, vegetables, milk, grains, dona-pattal and kulhad,"" Puri said.He claimed ABAP was not against any caste or class, but asserted that it could not compromise on purity and tradition and would not tolerate attempts to defile food or puja items.""We are seeing a conspiracy is being hatched continuously to break our tradition and sadhana.

BEIRUT : Over 2,000 Turkish citizens and some foreigners started boarding a Turkish military ship late Wednesday that brought in aid and will take them out of a country being hit by Israeli airstrikes targeting Hezbollah Zehra Cibbin, an ethnic Arab from the southeastern Turkish city of Mardin who lives in Beirut with her Lebanese husband, got off a bus packed with the other evacuees, her two children in tow and luggage in hand.""It's indescribable. They bombed the street below our house. From that moment on, it was over for me, I said I didn't want to stay in Beirut anymore,"" said Cibbin, 46.Cibbin said they decided to leave Beirut out of fear for their lives, putting no thought into what will happen when they arrive in Turkey .She spoke to The Associated Press before getting in line to board the TCG Bayraktar amphibious landing vessel, which along with the TCG Sancaktar will take on evacuees.They are part of a six-ship convoy including escorts that set sail from the southern Turkish port of Mersin early Wednesday, transported 300 tons of humanitarian supplies, including food, hygiene kits, kitchenware, tents, beds and blankets.Besides the Turkish citizens, people from Bulgaria, Romania and Kazakhstan were among those who applied to evacuate on the ships. Officials did not provide numbers.The Associated Press was the only non-government media invited aboard the ships to cover the evacuation operation."" Israel 's aggression has severely impacted Lebanon and our brothers here,"" said Turkish Ambassador to Lebanon Ali Baris Ulusoy, standing in front of the Bayraktar.""We are carrying out an operation today with two aims: to provide humanitarian aid to our Lebanese brothers and to ensure the safe return of our citizens who are in a difficult situation"", Ulusoy said.Hundreds lined up before the Bayraktar as Turkish soldiers and sailors checked the evacuees' passports and their luggage was examined by metal detectors and drug-sniffing dogs before they were allowed to boardAnother Turkish citizen waiting with her family was Abir Gokcimen, who said she left her extended family and husband in Beirut and hopes the war that spread to Lebanon will end soon. She hopes to come back to Lebanon as soon as the danger passes.The journey back to Mersin is expected to take about 10 hours.Turkey's government plans to organize more sea evacuations if necessary and is contemplating charter flights to repatriate citizens.Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel on Oct 8, 2023, the day after Hamas' surprise attack into Israel ignited the war in Gaza. Hezbollah and Hamas are both allied with Iran, and Hezbollah says its attacks are aimed at aiding the Palestinians. Israel has carried out airstrikes in response and the conflict steadily escalated, erupting into a full-fledged war last month.Israel has inflicted a punishing wave of blows against Hezbollah in recent weeks and says it will keep fighting until tens of thousands of displaced Israeli citizens can return to their homes in the north.More than 1,300 people have been killed in Lebanon and over a million have been displaced since the fighting escalated in mid-September.Earlier on Wednesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ramped up his rhetoric against Israel during his party's first meeting of the new legislative year, declaring that Turkey ""has more than enough power to thwart expansionist ambitions"" of Israel and doubling down on his claims that Israel would target Turkey after Gaza and Lebanon.","Over 2,000 Turkish citizens and some foreigners started boarding a Turkish military ship late Wednesday.

Sean Combs: Sean Diddy's legal team accuse US government of leaking Cassie assault footage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sean-diddys-legal-team-accuse-us-government-of-leaking-cassie-assault-footage/articleshow/114102077.cms,"Sean 'Diddy' Combs and Casandra Ventura (Picture Credit: X)

Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs' attorney accused the federal agents and prosecutors of leaking surveillance footage in a court filing on Wednesday.The hip-hop mogul’s lawyers are accusing the government of leaking hotel surveillance footage to CNN, in which he could be clearly seen beating his ex-girlfriend.After the surveillance footage was released by CNN in May, Combs was forced to publicly apologise for his ""inexcusable"" behaviour.A video from an InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles shows Combs, wearing a towel, striking, kicking, and dragging Cassie (Casandra Ventura) as she tries to leave.While prosecutors haven't named her, the case aligns with Cassie's lawsuit, which accused Combs of years of abuse.The defendant's lawyers have requested that the widely circulated video be excluded from the trial. On the eve of his court appearance, the music mogul's attorneys claimed that leaks had caused ""damaging, highly prejudicial pretrial publicity,"" which they argued could taint the jury pool and deny Combs a fair trialWhereas prosecutors have made it clear in court papers that the particular footage is the key evidence in their case, and that footage will be used as a piece of evidence during the trial.While the source of the footage leak still remains unclear, in a court filing on Wednesday, Combs’ lawyers blamed the Department of Homeland Security for the leak when they raided his homes in March.“The videotape was leaked to CNN for one reason alone: to mortally wound the reputation and the prospect of Sean Combs successfully defending himself against these allegations,” the lawyers, Marc Agnifilo and Teny Geragos, wrote.According to the government’s account of the hotel footage, Combs assaulted his former girlfriend in an attempt to prevent her from leaving a freak-off session; prosecutors have said they have evidence that there was at least one prostitute inside Mr Combs’s hotel room.Prosecutors referenced the video in their indictment, stating that Combs attempted to bribe a hotel security worker with a ""stack of cash"" to keep the incident under the sheets.Combs, who has pleaded not guilty, was arrested last month and is being held without bail on charges of sex trafficking by force, transportation for prostitution, and racketeering conspiracy . His attorneys are pushing for a speedy trial, while Combs also faces several civil lawsuits from alleged victims.","Hip-hop mogul's lawyers accuse federal agents and prosecutors of leaking hotel surveillance footage.

Esmail Qaani: Who is Esmail Qaani? Iran's Quds Force commander missing since Israel's strike on Beirut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/who-is-esmail-qaani-irans-quds-force-commander-missing-since-israels-strike-on-beirut/articleshow/114042086.cms,"Who is Esmail Qaani? Iran's Quds Force commander missing since Israel's strike on Beirut (Picture credit: Reuters)

Esmail Qaani was born in 1957 in Mashhad, Iran. He rose through the ranks of Iran’s military elite during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.

He has spent decades as a key figure within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), eventually becoming deputy commander of the Quds Force in 1997. The Quds Force, the overseas arm of the IRGC, handles Iran’s foreign military operations and support for allied paramilitary groups across the Middle East .

Qaani’s leadership became prominent after the assassination of his predecessor, General Qassem Soleimani, who was killed by a US drone strike in Baghdad in January 2020. Soleimani was a charismatic leader, deeply respected by Iran’s allies, including Hezbollah, Iraqi Shi’ite militias, and the Houthis in Yemen.



Qaani took over as head of the Quds Force, but unlike Soleimani, his influence has been more subdued.

67-year-old Qaani has maintained a lower profile compared to Soleimani. While Soleimani was often photographed on the front lines in Iraq and Syria, Qaani has preferred to conduct his meetings behind closed doors.

His leadership has also been characterised by less direct engagement with Iran’s Arab allies, a result of his limited Arabic language skills. Analysts have noted that this language barrier, along with his more discreet approach, has made it challenging for Qaani to build the same level of rapport with militias in Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria.

Despite this, Qaani vowed to continue Soleimani’s mission of expelling U.S. forces from the Middle East. In a public statement after Soleimani's death, Qaani declared that ""the only compensation for us would be to remove America from the region.""

Qaani’s last known location was in Beirut's southern suburbs, which is known as the Dahiyeh, a stronghold of Hezbollah. He was there during the Israeli airstrike that targeted Hashem Safieddine, who is seen as a likely successor to Nasrallah.

Since then, both Qaani and Safieddine have been unreachable, leading to growing concerns about their fate. Israeli officials have not confirmed any specific casualties from the strikes but have said that the results are still being assessed.

As tensions in West Asia escalate, the whereabouts of Esmail Qaani , Commander of Iran 's Quds Force , have become the subject of widespread speculation. Qaani has not been heard from since Israeli airstrikes targeted Beirut's southern suburbs last week, reported Reuters citing Iranian sources.These strikes, which hit a Hezbollah stronghold, also targeted senior Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine .Qaani’s absence has stirred concern, particularly given the strategic role he plays in Iran's military operations across the region.Qaani's disappearance follows the killing of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in a previous Israeli airstrike on September 27. Qaani had travelled to Lebanon to meet Hezbollah officials after Nasrallah's death. His silence since the most recent strikes has led to rumours in media outlets, including Turkish and Israeli sources, suggesting he may have been killed. Iranian authorities , however, have not confirmed his death.If confirmed, Qaani’s death would severely undermine Iran's ability to coordinate its proxy forces across the region. The Quds Force plays a crucial role in managing Iran’s relationships with Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, and Shi’ite militias in Iraq. Losing its commander, especially in the wake of recent Israeli military operations, could leave a significant void in Tehran’s regional strategy.In recent weeks, Israel has intensified its airstrikes on Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, further destabilising an already volatile region. The death of Hezbollah leader Nasrallah in late September marked a significant blow to the group, and the potential loss of Qaani would represent a further setback for Iran's regional influence.Who is Esmail Qaani?","Esmail Qaani is the head of Iran's Quds Force, the overseas arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

"Israel shares disturbing video of chaos, panic during October 7 Hamas onslaught",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-shares-disturbing-video-of-chaos-panic-during-october-7-hamas-onslaught/articleshow/114062761.cms,"What happened on October 7, 2023



Supernova music festival, killing hundreds and abducting dozens



NEW DELHI: Israel on Tuesday shared a video commemorating the October 7 attack by Hamas , which claimed the lives of more than 1,200 people and saw over 100 individuals abducted by the militant group.In a post on X sharing a video, Israel said, ""One year ago, Iran-backed terrorists launched a war to wipe Israel off the map. They slaughtered more than a thousand innocents and took 251 hostage.Every day since, Israel has been working to bring all the hostages home while protecting its citizens and fighting a multi-front war for its very survival.""On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a large-scale, surprise assault on Israel, marking one of the deadliest escalations in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in recent years. The attack coincided with the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah and significantly intensified hostilities in the region, prompting a swift and aggressive response from the Israeli military.The assault began early in the morning when Hamas, which controlsGaza , fired thousands of rockets into Israeli territory. Cities including Tel Aviv, Ashkelon, and Jerusalem were targeted, triggering sirens and causing civilians to seek shelter.However, the rocket attacks were part of a broader, coordinated operation. Hamas militants breached the heavily fortified Gaza-Israel border, using bulldozers to break through barriers, motorcycles for rapid movement, and paragliders to bypass security checkpoints. The militants entered Israeli communities and military bases near the border, leading to numerous casualties.The attack resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Israelis, both civilians and military personnel. In a shocking development, Hamas fighters took dozens of hostages, including women, children, and soldiers, transporting them back to Gaza. Videos circulated on social media showed hostages being paraded through Gaza’s streets, heightening tensions. The abductions added a layer of complexity to Israel's military response as the safety of the hostages became a critical concern.In a forceful response Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) launched extensive airstrikes targeting Hamas positions, command centers, and weapons storage facilities in Gaza. The Israeli government declared a state of war and mobilised hundreds of thousands of reservists.The IDF sought to regain control of the border areas and eliminate any Hamas militants still operating inside Israeli territory. In the ensuing hours, precision airstrikes aimed to disable Hamas’s military capabilities, though these operations also caused significant destruction in Gaza, leading to civilian casualties.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu then addressed the nation and declared that Israel is at war and promised a decisive, prolonged response.He vowed that Hamas would ""pay a heavy price"" for the attack, calling it a ""day of infamy"" for Israel.What began as a night of celebration at Israel's Supernova music festival turned into horror when Hamas militants launched a deadly ambush, firing indiscriminately and abducting dozens of attendees. Organised by Osher and Michael Waknin, the event was intended to promote friendship, love, and freedom but became the site of the deadliest attack in Israel's 75-year history.The festival, which attracted around 3,500 electronic music enthusiasts from Israel and abroad, featured multiple stages, international DJs, and camping facilities. As dawn broke on October 7, the music abruptly stopped when rockets fired by Hamas targeted the venue, signalling the start of the tragic events.Ephraim Mordechayev, a 23-year-old soldier enjoying the festivities, recounted his experience. Initially, he and his friends, used to the occasional rocket launches from the Gaza Strip, did not comprehend the severity of the situation. However, as chaos spread, they realised that armed militants had infiltrated the event, arriving on foot, motorcycles, and even by air, firing automatic weapons at civilians.""There is someone that is 20, 10 metres from you with guns and trying to kill you,"" Mordechayev told AFP.","Israel on Tuesday shared a video commemorating the October 7 attack by Hamas.

He later settled in Normandy , France, in 2016, where he pursued a career as a painter.Retailleau, who recently took office as France’s new interior minister, said on X that Omar bin Laden had been residing in the Orne department of Normandy as the spouse of a British citizen.He added that Omar bin Laden “posted comments on his social networks in 2023 that advocated terrorism,” prompting the prefect of Orne to issue an expulsion order.Retailleau said, ""I am today issuing an administrative ban on Mr. Omar Bin Laden, the eldest son of the international terrorist Osama Bin Laden. Mr. Bin Laden, who has lived in Orne for several years as the spouse of a British national, posted comments on his social networks in 2023 that were an apology for terrorism. As a result, the Prefect of Orne issued an OQTF and obtained Mr. Bin Laden's departure. The courts have confirmed the regularity of this decision taken for national security. The administrative ban on the territory guarantees that Mr. Bin Laden will not be able to return to France for any reason whatsoever.""“The courts have confirmed the legality of this decision taken in the interests of national security,” Retailleau affirmed. Additionally, the minister signed a ban preventing Omar bin Laden from re-entering France “for any reason whatsoever.” No further details were provided, and it remains unclear whether he has already left the country.Omar bin Laden gained media attention in 2007 when he married British national Jane Felix-Browne, who later adopted the Muslim name Zaina Mohammed.The marriage, marked by the couple's significant age gap, sparked widespread interest. Omar's application to reside in the UK was previously denied by British authorities.Osama bin Laden, the son of a wealthy Saudi construction tycoon, reportedly fathered around two dozen children. He was killed by US special forces in Pakistan in 2011.Retailleau has pledged to tackle issues related to immigration and crime and said that “the rule of law is neither intangible nor sacred.” His appointment as interior minister reflects the French government’s shift to the right under the leadership of new Prime Minister Michel Barnier, following a hung parliament result in this summer’s legislative elections.","Omar bin Laden, 43, was born in Saudi Arabia and has also lived in Sudan and Afghanistan.

Fat Bear contest: Winner claims revenge by beating bear that killed her cub,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fat-bear-contest-winner-claims-revenge-by-beating-bear-that-killed-her-cub/articleshow/114103178.cms,"Grazer at Katmai National Park in Alaska (AP)

The winner of this year's Fat Bear Contest has triumphed over the bear that tragically killed her cub this summer. Grazer secured her victory by defeating the formidable Chunk , receiving over 40,000 votes from fans watching live at Alaska’s Katmai National Park and Preserve.The Fat Bear Contest invites fans to vote for their favourite bear based on winter preparedness, highlighting the fat accumulated during the summer months.Each year, 12 bears are pitted against each other in a tournament-style bracket. The bears feed on the abundant sockeye salmon that leap upstream at Brooks River, often catching them mid-air at the falls.Grazer’s cub met its fate after slipping over the waterfall, where it was killed by Chunk, the largest brown bear on the river. Grazer's attempts to save her cub were recorded on the live cameras, which have also documented other bear interactions, including a recent incident involving another bear, Bear 402, who was killed by a male bear just before the contest bracket was released.Grazer, easily recognisable by her distinctive blond ears and straight muzzle, is known for her strength and fearlessness, earning her the respect of other bears. Meanwhile, Chunk’s sheer size and aggression have allowed him to dominate the river, reportedly consuming 42 salmon in just ten hours.The annual contest, which attracted over 1.3 million votes last year, celebrates the resilience of the 2,200 brown bears inhabiting the preserve on the Alaska Peninsula. With live cameras capturing their activities, Katmai has become a popular tourist destination, offering viewing stands for visitors eager to witness these magnificent creatures in action.","Grazer defeated the formidable Chunk at Alaska’s Katmai National Park.

Hurricane Milton makes landfall: Will Trump's Mar-a-Lago in Florida survive?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hurricane-milton-makes-landfall-will-trumps-mar-a-lago-in-florida-survive/articleshow/114102808.cms,"As Hurricane Milton crashes into Florida ’s Gulf Coast, there are rising concerns about the survival of former President Donald Trump ’s famed Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach . The storm, which made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane, has already caused significant damage across the state, raising questions about whether the “Winter White House” will weather this storm as it has in the past.Mar-a-Lago, built in 1927 by cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, has withstood several hurricanes over the decades.The structure, anchored to the coral reef beneath it, has concrete and steel foundations, with walls as thick as three feet, making it remarkably resilient, the Palm Beach Post reported.As Tony Senecal, Trump’s former butler, famously said in 2005, “This place will not move.” Despite this confidence, recent storms have tested the limits of Mar-a-Lago’s durability.In 2017, Hurricane Irma caused roof damage and knocked down several trees on the property. Although the estate escaped significant structural damage, the storm highlighted the potential vulnerability of even this sturdy mansion. Earlier hurricanes, such as Frances and Jeanne in 2004, similarly left the property with minor damage, mostly to landscaping, the Palm Beach Post reported. Trump purchased the estate in 1985, turning it into a private club while retaining part of it for personal use.Now, with Hurricane Milton producing winds over 100 mph and multiple tornadoes across Florida, Palm Beach and Mar-a-Lago face another test. The storm made landfall near Siesta Key, bringing destructive winds and a potentially deadly storm surge. Videos shared on social media showed funnel clouds forming over Palm Beach County, a stark reminder of the storm's power.More than one million Floridians are without power, and emergency services in some counties have already been suspended as officials urge residents to shelter in place.","Former President Donald Trump bought Mar-a-Lago in 1985 and turned it into a private club.

Vice President Kamala Harris is once again under fire from MAGA supporters , who have accused her of adopting a 'new accent' during her recent appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert During her Colbert interview, Harris engaged in casual banter and opened a Miller High Life beer, aiming to connect with voters on a personal level.However, her comments on empathy and international issues—where she said, ""Have you no empathy, man? No, for the suffering of other people? Have you no sense of purpose? We cannot lose belief in the possibility""—provoked backlash from MAGA supporters, who quickly took to social media to voice their discontent.One MAGA supporter exclaimed, “JAMAICAN ACCENT ALERT?? A new one to add to the long list of Kamalas!” Others described her performance as a “sad, cringe-worthy attempt to act like she’s ‘relatable,’”.The reaction continued to intensify, with comments like, “Imagine if President Trump did these accents. He’d be impeached and probably indicted for them.”This isn’t the first time Harris has faced such accusations. Earlier this year, at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Phoenix Awards Dinner, she was similarly criticized for allegedly using an accent to appeal to her audience.Despite her attempts to engage with Black voters—showcasing her membership in a historically Black sorority and addressing her community—MAGA users labeled her approach as inauthentic. One commenter remarked, ""Kamala’s new accent... worse than Hillary,"" while another highlighted the various accents she has reportedly adopted over the years.Harris, who has faced scrutiny for her handling of various issues during her campaign, used the Colbert interview to critique Trump’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.She recalled the chaos of the early days of the crisis and questioned Trump’s decisions, particularly allegations from journalist Bob Woodward’s new book that claimed he provided rare testing equipment to Russian President Vladimir Putin while Americans struggled to access tests.","US Vice President Kamala Harris is once again under fire from MAGA supporters.

Trump also mentioned his growing lead in the polls, stating that he is ""leading in all swing states"" and that his advantage continues to increase as the election approaches.Reiterating his decision, Trump said there was no need for another debate as voting had already begun. ""THERE WILL BE NO REMATCH! BESIDES, KAMALA STATED CLEARLY, YESTERDAY, THAT SHE WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN JOE BIDEN, SO THERE IS NOTHING TO DEBATE,"" he wrote, dismissing Harris’s policies as a continuation of Biden’s.This latest declaration from Trump follows a similar rejection earlier in September when he first declined a rematch with Harris. At that time, he had posted, ""When a prizefighter loses a fight, the first words out of his mouth are, ‘I WANT A REMATCH.’ Polls clearly show that I won the Debate against Comrade Kamala Harris."" Trump had initially agreed to a Fox News debate on September 4th, but Harris’s team only accepted a debate on ABC News scheduled for a later date.Despite speculation about further debates, Trump has now firmly shut down the idea. ""VOTING HAS ALREADY BEGUN,"" he said, and reiterated his claim that Harris’s policies mirrored those of President Biden, ""SO THERE IS NOTHING TO DEBATE"".Earlier in the campaign, Trump rejected a similar invitation from CNN for an October 23rd debate, which Harris had accepted. The race between Trump and Harris is increasingly tight, with polls showing it neck-and-neck. Harris entered the race after President Joe Biden stepped aside following a poor debate performance, which initially gave Trump a lead, but Harris’s entry has since narrowed the gap.","Former President Donald Trump has once again rejected the possibility of debating Vice President Kamala Harris.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

She cracked a beer with the host in one interview, revealed on another radio show that she's a fan of Formula One racing, and in a third, spoke feelingly about taking care of her mother when she was stricken with cancer. A Kamala Harris ' media blitz on Tuesday sought to generate vibes and humanize her for an electorate large sections of whom say they are not very familiar with her, but it left her MAGA critics unimpressed.Trump minions who complained that she does not do one-on-one interviews are now complaining that she is doing too many, after Harris appeared on 60 Minutes , ABC's The View , Howard Stern Show , the podcast Call Her Daddy , and Late Show with Stephen Colbert over the past 72 hours. ""Whose brilliant idea was it to send her out on a comedy tour as a Category 5 hurricane barrels toward the Gulf coast?"" asked Kayleigh McEnany , Trump's former press secretary, who called it ""political malpractice"" even though her MAGA supremo remains an unrelenting media hog despite his disdain for what he characterizes as ""fake news.""Trump himself, ever mindful of media metrics, waded into the issue, denigrating the five women hosts who constitute a panel on ABC's The View, calling them ""degenerates"" and ""dumb"" who were soft on ""Lyin’ Kamala"" who is being ""exposed as a 'dummy' every time she does a show.""Indeed, Harris got a warm reception and mostly softball questions on all the shows, quite different in tone and tenor though to the simpering, sycophantic encounters Trump has with his MAGA hosts on Fox and allied platforms. Stephen Colbert welcomed her with a beer, with a political aphorism that “People vote for the person they'd have a beer with,” but that in turn triggered the MAGA mob, which found it hard to digest that she was having a beer on a late night show when a Cat 5 hurricane was roaring towards Florida. “She did this to appeal to white men in the midwest,” wailed one MAGA troll.On the Howard Stern show she revealed that she is a fan of Formula one racing, and her favorite driver is “Lewis Hamilton, of course,” – another perceived outreach for the white male vote. But the most glowing reviews for Harris came on ABC’s The View, which has an all-women panel, including a former Trump aide, and a Republican never-Trumper. “I’m basking in the light…I hope we can put this woman in that black job,” joked host Whoopi Goldberg, referring to Trump’s reference to immigrants taking “black jobs.”","Kamala Harris' media blitz on Tuesday sought to generate vibes and humanize her for an electorate large sections of whom say they are not very familiar with her.

Amidst the deteriorating relationship, Pakistani border troops and Afghan Taliban fighters engaged in a clash while the former country's forces engaged in fence repair work.The incident occurred after the Afghan side launched an attack on a border post in the Naushki-Ghazni sector of the Pak-Afghan border , as reported by The Express Tribune. In response, the Pakistan Army launched a strong counterattack on the Afghan checkpoints, resulting in significant casualties for the Afghan Taliban.The Pakistani newspaper's sources suggested that Pakistan would continue to take robust measures to defend its borders, and its security forces reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the country's territorial integrity, delivering a decisive response to this aggression from Afghanistan.This incident was not an isolated case of unprovoked aggression from Afghan forces. In the previous month, the Afghan Taliban initiated unprovoked firing using heavy weapons, targeting Pakistani check posts from the Afghan region of Plosin. The fighting that took place during the night between September 8 and 9 resulted in the death of at least 16 Afghan Taliban fighters and the injury of 27 others.The Taliban came to power in Afghanistan in 2021, allegedly with the support of Pakistan, which had hoped that they would eliminate the threat of militancy emanating from their soil.

ISLAMABAD: The JUI-F has dismissed rumours that its president Maulana Fazlur Rehman has agreed to lend support to the PML-N-led ruling coalition on a proposed constitutional amendment , according to a media report on Wednesday. The Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) has claimed that the decision to table the 'Constitutional Package' in Parliament had been postponed by the government at its request, The Dawn newspaper reported.The paper quoted sources in the party as saying that the stance regarding opposition to the amendment had not changed, calling the matter ""disputed"".According to a JUI-F source, the government agreed to postpone the amendment at the demand of Maulana Rehman. ""Now…this matter will be taken up after the SCO summit,"" said a party office-bearer.On Monday, the Maulana attended a multi-party moot on Palestine at the invitation of the president and the prime minister and also held a meeting with the bigwigs of the ruling coalition, giving rise to speculations that he had agreed to support the government.However, according to the party spokesperson, there was no truth to these reports while insiders termed the amendment disputed which the JUI-F chief would not agree to ""under the current circumstances"".Sources said the JUI-F endorsed a separate constitutional court but expressed reservations over the constitutional amendment.""Our concern was based on common sense - we demanded the document that we were supposed to vote for, but the government negotiating teams failed to do so,"" a senior party official remarked on the dialogue between the government and the JUI-F last month.The JUI-F still expects the government to share the draft with the party. The JUI-F leader said they would also share their draft on the constitutional court with the government and expected the government to do the same. In order to take everyone on board, the JUI-F leaders have suggested a separate constitutional bench instead of an independent court.On the other hand, the government is almost ready to table the constitutional amendment, and sources in the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) believe that this time, it would not be rushed through Parliament.""There will be separate sessions of the National Assembly and Senate and it is likely to be held on October 18,"" they added.It is likely that the National Assembly and Senate sessions will separately be convened on the same day and after getting it cleared from one house, the amendment would be introduced in the other the same day.In order to achieve a two-thirds majority, the ruling alliance has been trying to win over Maulana Rehman as well as some Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf-linked lawmakers whose votes against the party line would not be annulled following a review of Article 63A of the Constitution.The Pakistan Peoples Party and PML-N are in contact with Akhtar Mengal, the head of the Balochistan National Party (BNP-M) as well, hoping to secure the support of two BNP senators.Sardar Mengal, who recently resigned from the National Assembly, is still a member of the house as his resignation hasn't been accepted by the NA speaker, Dawn reported.",The Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) has dismissed rumours that its president Maulana Fazlur Rehman has agreed to lend support to the PML-N-led ruling coalition.

Bangladesh's Yunus says no elections before reforms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladeshs-yunus-says-no-elections-before-reforms/articleshow/114042114.cms,"'Write as you please'

Bangladesh 's interim leader has refused to give a timeframe for elections following the ouster of his autocratic predecessor, saying in an interview published Tuesday that reforms are needed before polls.Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus was appointed the country's ""chief advisor"" after the student-led uprising that toppled ex-premier Sheikh Hasina in August.The 84-year-old microfinance pioneer is helming a temporary administration, to tackle what he has called the ""extremely tough"" challenge of restoring democratic institutions.""None of us are aiming at staying for a prolonged time,"" Yunus said of his caretaker government, in an interview published by the Prothom Alo newspaper.""Reforms are pivotal,"" he added. ""If you say, hold the election, we are ready to hold the election. But it would be wrong to hold the election first.""Hasina's 15-year rule saw widespread human rights abuses, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killings of her political opponents.More than 600 people were killed in the weeks leading up to her ouster, according to a preliminary United Nations report which said the figure was likely an underestimate.Her government was also accused of politicising courts and the civil service, as well as staging lopsided elections, to dismantle democratic checks on its power.Yunus said he had inherited a ""completely broken down"" system of public administration that needed a comprehensive overhaul to prevent a future return to autocracy.""Reforms mean we will not allow a repetition of what happened in the past"", he added.Yunus also batted away criticism at the numerous politicians, senior police officers and other Hasina loyalists arrested on murder charges after her government's ouster.The arrests have prompted accusations that Yunus' caretaker government would hold politicised trials of senior figures from Hasina's regime.But Yunus said it was his intention that any criminal trials initiated against those arrested would remain free from government interference.""Once the judicial system is reformed, then the issues will come forward, about who will be placed on trial, how justice will be carried out,"" he said.At least 25 journalists -- considered by Hasina's opponents to be partisans of her government -- have been arrested for alleged violence against protesters since her downfall.Press watchdog Reporters Without Borders has condemned those arrests as ""systematic judicial harassment"".But Yunus insisted he wanted media freedom.""Write as you please,"" he told the newspaper.""Criticise. Unless you write, how will we know what is happening or not happening?""","Muhammad Yunus was appointed the country's ""chief advisor"" after the student-led uprising that toppled ex-premier Sheikh Hasina in August.
