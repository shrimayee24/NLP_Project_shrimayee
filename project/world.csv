VIJAYAWADA: A woman allegedly murdered her husband with the help of her boyfriend after lacing biryani with sleeping pills, police said.The incident occurred at Chiluvur village in Duggirala mandal. The victim, Lokam Shivanagaraju, an onion trader, had been married to Lakshmi Madhuri since 2007.The couple had two sons. Madhuri, employed at a cinema ticket counter in Vijayawada, had reportedly developed a relationship with Gopi, a native of Sattenapalli.According to the police, Madhuri viewed her husband as an obstacle to her relationship. On the night of Jan 18, she allegedly mixed around 20 sleeping tablets into the biryani prepared for Shivanagaraju.After he became unconscious, her boyfriend Gopi reportedly came to the house around 11.30 pm. Police said Gopi sat on Shivanagaraju's chest while Madhuri suffocated him with a pillow, killing him.After confirming his death, Gopi left the house. Shockingly, Madhuri reportedly spent the entire night watching porn videos while keeping her husband's dead body in the room. In the early morning, she raised an alarm, claiming he died of a heart attack.Suspicion arose when relatives noticed injuries and bleeding from the victim's ear. The post-mortem confirmed death due to suffocation, leading to the arrest of Madhuri and the detention of Gopi.

'Rahul Gandhi stands exposed':

BJP

NEW DELHI: Former Union minister Shakeel Ahmad, who resigned from the Congress in November 2025, on Saturday launched a scathing attack on senior party leader Rahul Gandhi , calling him “darpok” (coward) and “insecure.”Ahmad also described Gandhi, a former Congress president and the current leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha, as “dictatorial” and “non-democratic.”""Rahul Gandhi is a coward and an insecure person. He does not get that 'boss feeling' before anyone who is senior to him or has a big public support. He is uncomfortable with any such person and is thus dictatorial and not democratic,"" Ahmad told PTI.The ex-Congress general secretary further highlighted how the Raebareli MP, who was party chief during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, even lost from his own Amethi constituency, a traditional Gandhi family bastion, and attributed the defeat to Gandhi's “attitude.”Ahmad, a three-time MLA and two-time MP from Bihar, also claimed that he did not come across anyone alleging that their names were removed from the voter list during the Special Intensive Revision exercise in the state last year.The veteran politician resigned from the grand old party just days before the results of the Bihar assembly election, in which it won only six of the 61 seats it contested as part of the RJD-led opposition alliance.The ruling NDA swept the state.Seizing on Ahmad's remarks, the BJP said they have ""exposed"" Gandhi.""Shakeel Ahmad has exposed Rahul Gandhi. Rahul Gandhi keeps showing that he is the most tolerant and democratic person, but the reality is something else. He is the most dictatorial person and has the same Emergency-mindset that Indira Gandhi had,"" BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla posted on X.Responding to Ahmad's claim that he did not find any voter alleging their name was removed from the electoral rolls during the SIR in Bihar, Poonawalla slammed Gandhi, saying the Congress leader made ""baseless"" allegations of 'vote chori' to shift the blame for his party's defeat onto ""others.""","Former Union minister Shakeel Ahmad calls Rahul Gandhi a 'coward' and 'insecure' Gandhi is the current leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha.

NEW DELHI/ SRINAGAR: A Delhi court granted Saturday interim bail to J&K independent MP Sheikh Abdul Rashid aka Engineer Rashid, allowing him to attend Parliament’s budget session from Jan 28 under armed escort.Held in Tihar jail since 2019, the 58-year-old MP faces charges under UAPA in a 2017 terrorist-funding case probed by NIA. He contested 2024 Lok Sabha polls from jail and stunned mainstream parties by defeating National Conference vice president Omar Abdullah by more than 200,000 votes from Baramulla in north Kashmir.Additional Sessions Judge Prashant Sharma permitted Rashid to attend sittings while remaining in custody, calling relief “limited in nature” and bound by strict conditions earlier imposed, including security arrangements and related expenses. Custody parole allows a prisoner to travel under police escort to a specific destination.Court had earlier granted similar permissions. Rashid attended the winter session last Nov under guard. He was also allowed custody parole between July 24 and Aug 4, 2025, for monsoon session sittings, and interim bail in 2024 to campaign in J&K assembly elections.Awami Itihaad Party, founded by Rashid in 2013 and listed by Election Commission as registered but unrecognised, welcomed the court order.Spokesperson Inam Un Nabi called it vital to ensure people of north Kashmir are not denied representation in Parliament.Nabi said travel expenses would depend on outcome of an appeal pending before high court. The party also renewed demand for Rashid’s release. Nabi said there was no justification to keep a two-time legislator and an elected MP behind bars, alleging victimisation for political beliefs. He cited former CJI DY Chandrachud’s recent remarks that even a few years of detention violate personal liberty.","Held in Tihar jail since 2019, the 58-year-old MP faces charges under UAPA in a 2017 terrorist-funding case probed by NIA.

‘Justice Delayed Is Justice Destroyed’: CJI Kant Calls High Courts Key Guardians Of Citizens’ Rights

.

‘Govt-dictated transfer shows erosion of judiciary’s autonomy’

NEW DELHI: Stressing that the biggest threat to the independence of the judiciary ""is from within"", Supreme Court judge Ujjal Bhuyan expressed on Saturday his dissent and disappointment with the collegium's decision to transfer Justice Atul Sreedharan from MP high court to Allahabad HC on the Centre's suggestion, and said it ""reveals a striking intrusion of executive influence"" in collegium system, which is ""unfortunate"".Without naming Justice Sreedharan, Justice Bhuyan asked why should a judge be transferred from one high court to another merely because he had passed some ""inconvenient order"" against the govt.SC collegium had in Aug recommended Justice Sreedharan's transfer from MP to Chhattisgarh HC but the collegium changed its decision on Centre's request and shifted him to Allahabad HC in Oct. Many law experts termed it a punitive measure against him for passing orders inconvenient to the govt. It was a bench headed by him that had in May taken suo motu cognisance against BJP minister Vijay Shah for using 'scurrilous language' against Col Sofiya Qureshi.""Then again when it is noted in collegium resolution itself that a particular HC judge who was to be transferred to another HC was subsequently transferred to different HC by modifying earlier recommendation on reconsideration sought by central govt. Does it not compromise the integrity of the collegium system,"" he said.Justice Bhuyan was delivering the Principal G V Pandit Memorial Lecture on ""Constitutional Morality and Democratic Governance"" at ILS Law College in Pune.The collegium resolution which was uploaded on the SC website stirred a storm as it revealed officially for the first time that the govt interferes in appointment of judges. But that was soon withdrawn and it was replaced with a new release after omitting that part.Justice Bhuyan said that the govt has no role or say in the transfer of judges which comes within the exclusive domain of the judiciary and that a transfer done at the instance of the govt reveals that the independence of the judiciary has been compromised.""When collegium itself records that the transfer was done at the request of the central govt, it reveals a striking intrusion of executive influence to what is constitutionally supposed to be an independent process created to make such immune to executive and political influence… It reflects clear admission of political executive influencing collegium decision... It's unfortunate,"" Justice Bhuyan said.He said the govt cannot say that such and such judge be transferred to such and such HC or not to be transferred there. ""It has become more important for the judiciary, particularly members of collegium, to continue to function independently and the integrity of the collegium system must be maintained at all costs. As judges we have taken an oath of the Constitution to perform our duty without fear or favour. We must remain true to our oath. If we lose our credibility then nothing will remain of the judiciary. Judges will be there, court will be there, matter will also be adjudicated but heart and soul will evaporate,"" he said.He said that constitutional morality, which means that the country is governed by rule of law and not by rule of people, is the soul of democratic governance and it ensures that democratic institutions function keeping in mind the overarching principles of liberty, exercising restraint and adhering to constitutional values and not bulldozing through on the strength of numbers, authority and power.""Judiciary has neither the purse nor the sword. All that it has is the faith reposed in it by the people and if that faith is breached then nothing will be left of the judiciary,"" he said while holding the collegium is not the best available system for appointment of judges but there is a scope of reform.""Sociology says that a man is a political animal and a judge is also a human being. It is, therefore, natural for a judge to have political and ideological leaning and there is nothing wrong in it. But that should not cloud the decision-making process of a judge who is not supposed to follow political ideology but constitutional principle in judicial proceedings. It would be a sad day for judiciary and by extension for our democracy if the decision in a case becomes a foregone conclusion the moment a case is listed before a particular judge or bench,"" he said.","Supreme Court judge Ujjal Bhuyan expressed his dissent and disappointment with the collegium's decision to transfer Justice Atul Sreedharan from MP high court to Allahabad HC. He said it ""reveals a striking intrusion of executive influence"" in collegium system, which is ""unfortunate""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127438367,imgsize-852752,width-400,resizemode-4/image-ians-ani.jpg"

PM attacks Stalin

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Saturday launched a sharp attack on Governor R N Ravi in the state assembly, accusing him of undermining constitutional conventions and insulting the office he holds by refusing to read the customary address at the start of the session.""By not reading speech prepared by this government elected by crores of people, governor is disgracing the position he holds,” Stalin said in the assembly. Referring to repeated confrontations, he added, “governors in the past were not like R N Ravi and I am constrained to criticise him.”Rejecting allegations surrounding patriotism and protocol, the chief minister said, “We are not inferior to anyone in patriotism, and no one needs to teach us,” stressing that respect for the national anthem was deeply ingrained in the State’s political culture.In his address, Stalin said the Governor’s conduct caused him distress, “However, the Governor is acting against the government. He repeatedly cites the same reason and walks out of the Assembly. I am someone who has deep respect for the nation and the national anthem,” he said.He also pointed out that assembly tradition in Tamil Nadu involved singing the Tamil Thai Vazhthu at the beginning of proceedings and the national anthem at the end.Highlighting his government’s record, Stalin said, “Because of the achievements of the Dravidian model government, Tamil Nadu has held its head high. Tamil Nadu has developed more than other states. The reason for this is our schemes.”He added, “As far as this government is concerned, once an achievement is made, an even greater one follows. Creating achievement upon achievement is the hallmark of the Dravidian model government.”The chief minister also dismissed opposition claims on law and order. “Incidents of crime are less in state during DMK regime when compared to AIADMK rule,” he said, adding, “Facing crises is not new to me and I have overcome many challenges.”Taking jibe at opposition Stalin said, “I was worried when DMK formed government because previous AIADMK government had left the state in bad shape and union govt is not in good terms with us, but now I am happy seeing state's growth,""The remarks come days after governor Ravi walked out of the assembly before delivering his inaugural address, alleging disrespect to the National Anthem and claiming his microphone was switched off. Speaker M Appavu had urged the governor to adhere to established legislative conventions.Raj Bhavan later defended the walkout, stating that the government-approved speech omitted references to issues such as atrocities against Dalits and sexual violence against Dalit women. Opposition AIADMK legislators also staged a walkout, citing concerns over law and order.Following which, Stalin said the DMK would consult like-minded opposition parties to pursue a constitutional amendment to abolish the practice of the Governor’s address at the start of the first Assembly session. In a post on X, he said, “First Tamil Nadu. Then Kerala. Now Karnataka. The pattern is clear and deliberate. Governors refusing to read the speech prepared by state governments and behaving like party agents, undermining duly elected state governments. ”He added, “As I stated earlier, the only solution now is to end the practice of commencing the first annual Assembly session with the Governor’s address. DMK will consult like-minded opposition parties across India and pursue a constitutional amendment in the very next parliamentary session to abolish this obsolete and irrelevant practice.”PM Modi on Friday launched NDA’s campaign for the upcoming polls in the state saying, ""countdown has begun"" for the end of the DMK govt in TN and the time has come for a ""double-engine"" NDA govt.""Tamil Nadu is ready for change. It wants freedom from DMK rule. Tamil Nadu wants a BJP-led NDA govt,"" PM Modi said at a rally at Mathuranthakam, near Chennai.Touching upon the lamp-lighting issue in Thiruparankundram,PM accused DMK of being hostile to Tamil culture.""DMK and its allies did not spare even the court in a bid to appease their vote bank,"" he said.

'Republic Day 2026 Flypast Will Be IAF's Tribute To Operation Sindoor': Says Wing Commander Deshwal

New Delhi: From Bactrian camels to Zanskar ponies, a rare contingent of “animal soldiers” will for the first time be seen marching down Kartavya Path joining the 6,050 military personnel during the 90-minute Republic Day parade on Monday.They will be under the command of Captain Harshita Yadav, daughter of a retired IAF officer, and from the first batch of Indian Army’s Remount & Veterinary Corps.Speaking to TOI, she said, “This contingent is very uniquely curated. There are two Bactrian camels from Ladakh, four Zanskar ponies, four raptors (specially-trained birds of prey), 10 military dogs, mostly indigenously-bred. They are all Army soldiers and have different operational roles.”Perfectly adapted to extreme cold, thin air and altitudes above 15,000 feet, the Bactrian camels, which are recently inducted in Army operations, can carry a load of up to 250 kg and traverse long distances in the cold deserts.She said the Indian Army has been using indigenously-bred dogs for quite some time and they are trained basically for two purposes — detection (explosives, mine detection, tracking, search and avalanche rescue) and protection (assault on enemies).“Training of birds like kites or any animal involves neuroscience. Once you understand the science behind these animals and the training part, then these are highly trainable,” Captain Harshita said.IAF Air Commodore Manish Sabharwal, during a Republic Day press preview on Friday, said the S-400 air defence system, which shot down multiple Pakistan aircraft and also a spy plane from a distance of over 300 km deep inside Pakistan, which is a “documented kill”, will also be showcased at the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) tableau during the parade for the first time.The tableau will showcase India's victory in Operation Sindoor last year and the jointness of the three services displayed during the decisive action. One side will feature lethal military weapons that proved crucial during the operation. The other side will depict the destruction of the infrastructure on the side of Pakistan.Major General Navraj Dhillon, Chief of Staff, Delhi Area, said Lt Gen Bhavnish Kumar, GOC, Delhi Area, will head the parade for the fourth time.Battalion, Shaktibaan regiment, drone shakti and robotic mules to take part in the parade for the first time, along with Ladakh Scouts,” he said. He said the Army will feature the debut of a Battle Array Formation showcasing synchronised manoeuvres alongside tanks, missile systems, drones and armoured platforms. The defence assets that will be showcased during the parade will include BrahMos, Akash missile system, Medium Range Surface-To-Air Missile (MRSAM) system, Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System (ATAGS), Dhanush artillery gun, Shaktiban and a static display of some drones.The parade will also see the debut of the Shaktiban Regiment, which has been set up in the artillery. The newly-raised regiment will be equipped with a drone, counter-drone and loiter munition. Eighteen marching contingents and 13 bands will take part in the parade.Akash weapon system and MRSAM system are being fielded in this year's parade. Universal Rocket Launcher System URLS 'Suryastra', which can carry out surface-to-surface strikes up to 300 km, is being showcased for the first time in the parade, Maj Gen Dhillon said.As European Council president Antonio Costa and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen will be the chief guests, a small EU contingent, comprising an officer of the colonel rank, will lead the delegation. Following him in their contingent will be four flag-bearers.A senior military official said women’s participation is also in big numbers. CRPF’s Assistant Commandant Simran Bala will be the first woman officer to lead an all-male contingent at the parade.Captain Samira, a fourth-generation army officer, is the commander of an Army tableau depicting the success of Op Sindoor. She told TOI the tableau will display the indigenously developed military assets and weapon systems used during the Pakistan conflict and will also highlight Atmanirbhar Bharat.DRDO will showcase some of its path-breaking innovations for national security during the parade. Apart from displaying long-range anti-ship hypersonic missile (LR-AShM), DRDO will have a tableau 'naval technologies for combat submarines'.A formation flying named “Operation Sindoor” comprising Rafale, Su-30, Jaguar and MiG-29 combat jets will feature in the IAF's R-Day flypast that will serve as a powerful symbol of the dominance it established during the four-day hostilities with Pakistan last May. A total of 29 aircraft, including 16 fighters, nine helicopters and four transport planes, will be part of the flypast.A total of 30 tableaux to roll down Kartavya Path and 150 years of Vande Mataram will be the theme of the parade.","A rare contingent of “animal soldiers’ will for the first time be seen marching down Kartavya Path.

'Netaji’s Strategic Realism Matters More Today As World Fragments', Says CDS Anil Chauhan At JNU

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said his govt was following Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's vision of a strong India as a weak nation could not achieve its goals. He added that the country now knew how to build, manage and use power.In a video address to a programme in Andaman and Nicobar Islands on Parakram Diwas, which commemorates Netaji's birth anniversary, Modi said due to the insecurities of those who came to office after independence - a swipe at Jawaharlal Nehru and his successors from Congress - the glorious history of the islands, which were briefly under the control of Bose's Indian National Army during the World War II, were not preserved as they wanted to credit only one family for independence.His govt has taken corrective measures, he added. Home minister Amit Shah lauded Netaji's ""unwavering determination to liberate India"" through his long and fraught journey across different countries and said every youth should read about his life to strengthen their resolve to protect the nation.""Netaji declared an independent India in 1943 by hoisting the tricolour in Andaman and Nicobar Islands,"" he said in a post. In his remarks, Modi said India was making its defence sector self-reliant in line with Bose's vision.India struck its enemies in their homes during Op Sindoor, he said in reference to the military strikes on terror sites in Pakistan after the Pahalgam attack, and destroyed them, he said, emphasising his govt's deft use of power to achieve its goals and the expansion of its defence production.""In their political self-interest, the nation's history was neglected,"" he said, noting that the islands continued to be knowns by the names of British officers before his govt made the correction. Port Blair was now 'Shri Vijaypuram', a name that reminded us of Netaji's victory, he said, recalling that 21 islands of Andamans were named after 21 Param Vir Chakra awardees in 2023.At a presser, BJP slammed Congress for trying to erase Bose's contribution from history in its long tenure in office and said he played the most decisive role in the country's independence. Nehru dismissed Bose's party Forward Bloc as a negative group against Congress and imbued with fascism and communalism, BJP's Sudhanshu Trivedi said, citing comments of B R Ambedkar and others to claim that Bose's campaign had ensured that the colonial rulers were not sure about the loyalty of Indian soldiers.",PM Narendra Modi said his govt was following Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's vision of a strong India as a weak nation could not achieve its goals.

5 girls booked under UP anti-conversion law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-girls-booked-under-up-anti-conversion-law/articleshow/127342164.cms,".

BAREILLY: An FIR has been registered under Section 3 of the stringent Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act against five minor Muslim girls -- aged between 15 and 17 -- for allegedly getting their 16-year-old Hindu friend to wear a burqa in Moradabad.The incident took place on Dec 12, 2025, but has come to light now after police said that they’ve registered a case following a complaint by the girl’s brother, Daksh Chaudhary, on Friday.If found guilty under this law, an accused, especially if the victim is a minor, can be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term “which shall not be less than 5 years but which may extend to 14 years”.Superintendent of police (rural) in Moradabad, Kunwar Akash Singh, told TOI, “As soon as we received the complaint, a First Information Report (FIR) was registered and further investigation is on.”Section 3 of the anti-conversion law deals with “prohibition of conversion from one religion to another by misrepresentation, force, fraud, undue influence, coercion, and allurement”.“My sister was talking to one of the girls whom she’d met about two months back and had been going out regularly with. The five girls who took away my sister in burqa had may have had some ill intention. So, I approached cops at Bilari police station,” Chaudhary, the complainant, told TOI.A purported video of the incident was widely circulated on social media.In the minute-long video clip, the girls can be seen in a narrow alley between houses. One of them is seen wearing a burqa over her dress with the other girls trying to help her.“The accused girls and the Hindu girl are friends. All are believed to be minors. That afternoon, they were on their way to a restaurant which crosses the victim’s brother’s shop. They didn’t want him to know about it. Fearful of getting caught, the Hindu girl may have worn her friends’ burqa,” said a police officer, privy to the case.He added that since it is a sensitive matter, the local police registered a case following the complaint filed by the family members.“Further investigation is on to find out the backgrounds of the young girls and their motive, if any, behind the incident,” the officer said. As they are minors, police said, they cannot be immediately put the girls in custody.","The incident took place on Dec 12, 2025, but has come to light now after police said that they’ve registered a case following a complaint by the girl’s brother.

Tharoor Snubs Congress, Skips Key Meeting; Zelensky Announces First US-Russia-Ukraine Talks

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor did not attend the meeting of Kerala state leadership with AICC high command Friday amid reports that he is upset over a recent ""snub"", even as the party stepped up planning for the upcoming state polls scheduled for mid-2026 and urged netas to put up a united fight.AICC chief Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi met important netas of the Kerala unit for discussion on poll campaign strategy and seat-sharing with allies.Among those who took part in the session were AICC general secretary K C Venugopal, special poll observer Sachin Pilot, senior neta Ramesh Chennithala, state president Sunny Thomas, LoP V D Satheesan, MPs Kodikunnil Suresh, Adoor Prakash, among others. However, Tharoor did not attend despite an invitation.The Thiruvananthapuram MP was in Kozhikode for Kerala Literature Festival where, sources said, he had a lecture scheduled on an important social reformer. Sources said he had informed the party about his inability to attend the meeting. However, Tharoor is said to be upset that Rahul did not acknowledge him while he mentioned other netas on the dais during Kochi ""mahapanchayat"" organised after UDF's victory in local body elections.Tharoor is said to have told the party about his unhappiness about the ""snub"".To media queries, party's state incharge Deepa Dasmunshi denied that Tharoor was unhappy with Congress.The events before Kochi had suggested a thaw between Tharoor and the party, after the MP's repeated statements and political stance over myriad issues had embarrassed the Congress brass. The repeated clashes between him and Congress had even triggered speculations that Tharoor was searching for political space outside Congress.For Kerala polls, Congress is also discussing the return of estranged ally Kerala Congress (Mani). The party has to decide whether MPs will be fielded in state polls, even as it is almost final that most of the MLAs will be repeated.

'Bangladesh does not deserve a govt aligned with radicals',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bangladesh-does-not-deserve-a-govt-aligned-with-radicals/articleshow/127331988.cms,"ANI file photo

Ousted Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina says in an interview with Alpyu Singh that free and fair elections in her country are impossible under Muhammad Yunus’ interim govt and that India deserves a reliable neighbour. Excerpts:

Tarique Rahman

has assumed office as

Bangladesh Nationalist Party

chairman recently. How do you look at his return?

Ex-PM Hasina Calls Yunus “Murderous Fascist,” Warns Bangladesh at Edge of Abyss

A lot of people are questioning whether an election could actually take place in Feb? If so, how will

Awami League

take part, considering that there is a ban on your party?

As atrocities against minorities continue in Bangladesh, India's external affairs ministry reacted by saying there is a disturbing pattern in all this. What do you think is reason behind these recurring attacks?

How can India help in restoring peace in Bangladesh?

What do you think is the future of India-Bangladesh bilateral relations?

The people of Bangladesh should remember that Tarique Rahman has lived in exile in London for years, far removed from the daily realities faced by ordinary citizens. He fled the country because of his role in abetting his late mother, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, in the embezzlement of public funds. This is not a matter of political disagreement, but of accountability and integrity.BNP leadership has consistently aligned itself with extremist elements when it suits its short-term interests, even at the cost of national stability... it has chosen exclusion, intimidation, and opportunism. Bangladesh deserves leadership that governs from within the country, respects pluralism, and is accountable to the people, not figures who seek power through alliances with radical forces while remaining safely abroad.The question is not whether elections will take place but whether these will be elections in any meaningful or legitimate sense... At present, Bangladesh is ruled by an unelected regime that has appointed itself the authority to rewrite our country's constitution and amend our legislation to ban the nation's most widely supported party from participating in elections.Over half the voters in Bangladesh have confidence in Awami League and would vote for us if Awami League were allowed to participate.It is precisely this fear that has led them to ban us.A govt's most basic duty is to protect its citizens. The interim govt has not only failed in this responsibility, it has actively emboldened this repression. Under Yunus, extremist groups that my govt worked hard to contain have been empowered and elevated to positions of authority. These criminals, many of whom belong to known terrorist orgs, have been allowed to spread a hardline ideology that threatens to remove any trace of diversity from our country and carry out deplorable acts of violence against peaceful Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, Ahmadi Muslims with total impunity. The current climate is the direct result of the appeasement of fundamentalist forces.India has rightly condemned the human rights abuses and political repression that have become all too common under the Yunus regime. They are watching in dismay right now as Bangladesh descends into lawlessness, as minority groups face daily acts of violence, as political imprisonments become the norm, and as harmful, hostile rhetoric emanates from Dhaka. India understands that prosperity of our two nations is tightly linked.n India is Bangladesh's closest friend and longest-standing ally, a relationship built through geography, history and cooperation. Yunus has done considerable damage to this relationship through his empowerment of extremist groups who freely target religious minorities with impunity and his willingness to allow mobs to besiege Indian diplomatic premises and threaten representatives. This is recklessness by an administration with neither the experience nor the mandate to dictate Bangladesh's foreign policy.India deserves a reliable partner in Bangladesh, one that can maintain stability and honour its commitments. We must return to being the friend our neighbours knew they could trust.",Ousted Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina says free and fair elections in her country are impossible under Muhammad Yunus’ interim govt. She says India deserves a reliable neighbour.

Amit Shah Vs Oppn Showdown: Bill To Remove PM, CMs Over Criminal Cases Sparks Big Lok Sabha Ruckus

Experts: 30-day bar not aligned with current procedure

NEW DELHI: An expansive anti -corruption bill has drawn criticism from a legal think tank and two law universities, which told a parliamentary committee that provisions linking the removal of a PM, CM, or minister to 30 days of arrest on serious criminal charges risk political misuse.Representatives of Vidhi Centre for Legal policy, National Law University (NLU)- Odisha and National University of Juridical Sciences (NUJS)- Kolkata, who were invited by the joint parliamentary committee scrutinising the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill, flagged a host of issues, including that it may override popular will.Two of them suggested the threshold for removal should be ""framing of charges"" as it will introduce an element of judicial scrutiny in the process, people in the know said. Vidhi Centre cautioned that certain provisions may invite constitutional challenges.It said the purported intent behind the bill is laudable and largely complies with constitutional doctrine.Representatives of two of these bodies pointed out that the global consensus, at least in established democracies, for removal of ministers from office is judicial conviction and the proposed law moves away from this and has a low threshold.Existing criminal provisions allow police to seek custody of an accused for up to 90 days in serious offences, and the 30-day bar is not congruent with the current procedure, it was noted.NUJS said the legislation may intend to curb criminality within politics, but it has a “high probability” of severely destabilising Union and state cabinets, sources aware of the details said. The varsity said it has potential to lead to policy paralysis at Centre and states.An investigation can turn into a “potential regime change operation,” NLU said, adding that the bill incentivises retaliation as state police can act against a visiting Union minister after central agencies take action against a chief minister or state minister.Vidhi Centre said, “The framework creates scope for political misuse. Arrests may be timed or selectively pursued.”NLU echoed similar views, saying opposing parties can use its provisions to destabilise legitimate govts. The trend over the past few decades suggests the possibility of its misuse and it will have a negative impact on the country’s democracy, it said. “Automatic removal of a PM or CM overrides the choice of the majority party and the voters,” it said.Though the bill seeks removal from office over arrest in offences where punishment is five years or more, it was also pointed out that there are several serious crimes, including corruption, where punishment may be less than five years.The govt has batted for the bill citing instances of ministers and even a chief minister — Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi — continuing to be in charge despite being under a long period of incarceration on corruption charges. However, it agreed to send the bill to the parliamentary panel headed by BJP MP Aparajita Sarangi for wider consultations. Most opposition parties have refused to be part of the panel.","Vidhi Centre for Legal policy, National Law University (NLU)- Odisha and National University of Juridical Sciences (NUJS)- Kolkata flagged a host of issues, including that it may override popular will.

'Bibi, Stop Taking Credit': Trump Humiliates Israeli PM At Davos; Calls Out Israeli Iron Dome 'Lie'

US President Donald Trump on Thursday said the United States is set to receive around $600 billion in tariff revenue, adding that the figure is expected to be “much more than that” next year.Trump made the remarks while addressing the World Economic Forum (WEF) Summit in Davos, where he also highlighted what he described as an unprecedented surge in investments flowing into the country.Linking the rise in investment to the November 5 election outcome, Trump said it had brought clarity about his administration’s tariff policy. “We're doing numbers in terms of people investing in the United States as we've never had before,” he said, adding that tariffs were aimed at protecting the country, which he claimed had been taken advantage of for years.Trump noted that the estimated $600 billion in tariff revenue does not include investments by countries and companies setting up operations in the US. “We'll have, I'd say, $600 billion worth of tariff money coming in. And I think we're going to have maybe more than that. By next year, it'll be much more than that,” he said.Highlighting corporate investments, Trump said Apple is spending $650 billion in the US, calling it a major commitment, and added that Toyota has also announced plans to invest in the country, according to news agency ANI.Recalling a meeting in Japan, he said Toyota’s leadership had confirmed the investment plans as part of a broader trend of global companies expanding their US footprint.Calling the developments “amazing,” Trump said, “We've never had anything like it or close,” adding that no other country was witnessing similar investment momentum.He claimed that from an investment perspective, people were in “great shape” and many investors were making substantial money.In Davos, Trump also waived tariffs planned on European allies following what he described as a framework deal over Greenland, though no details of the agreement were disclosed.",US President Donald Trump on Thursday said the United States is set to receive around $600 billion in tariff revenue next year.

A 37-year-old Minneapolis man was shot and killed by federal immigration officers on Saturday during an enforcement operation that has intensified protests and political debate in the Democratic city.: The man has been identified as Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old resident of south Minneapolis and a United States citizen. The incident was captured on camera by bystanders which went viral.: Family members and reports say Pretti worked as an intensive care unit nurse and had no serious criminal history beyond a few traffic tickets.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said agents were conducting a targeted immigration enforcement operation when Pretti approached US Border Patrol officers with a handgun and two magazines.DHS officials stated that agents attempted to disarm the man, he “violently resisted,” and one officer fired “defensive shots”.Local police confirmed Pretti was believed to be a lawfully armed gun owner with a permit to carry.The shooting took place near West 26th Street and Nicollet Avenue in south Minneapolis early on Saturday morning.This was the second fatal shooting involving federal agents in Minneapolis in about three weeks, following the earlier death of Renée Good.Large crowds gathered after the incident, with demonstrations and confrontations between residents and law enforcement. Authorities deployed tear gas and crowd control tactics to disperse the mob.The shooting drew sharp criticism from local officials, including Minnesota’s governor, mayor who challenged the federal account and called for calm and an investigation. MAGA base clapped back with Donald Trump, JD Vance accusing Minnesota of failing to comply with the law and obstructing ICE from doing their duties.Minneapolis police and federal authorities are continuing to investigate the shooting, and no charges have been announced.","The shooting took place near West 26th Street and Nicollet Avenue in south Minneapolis early on Saturday morning.

Trump Aide's Secret Mission On Capitol Riots Probe Shocks Democrats





FBI director Kash Patel has been accused of prioritising social activities, including jet skiing and football matches, over official meetings with international intelligence partners, according to a report in The New York Times.A senior FBI executive told the NYT that the Indian-origin director showed a lack of interest in office‑based meetings while attending a secret Five Eyes Conference in May. This meeting is a gathering of the top intelligence agencies from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.The executive claimed Patel’s staff said that Kash was unhappy with traditional meetings and would rather participate in social events instead. “Before the conference, his staff says he’s unhappy because he doesn’t like meetings in office settings. What he wants is social events,” the source told NYT.“He wants Premier soccer games. He wants to go jet skiing. He’d like a helicopter tour,"" the source said.The source said that they were in disbelief seeing Patel's leisure goals: “Is he really going to ask the MI5 director to go jet skiing instead of meeting? The schedule is set, and every Five Eyes partner is doing this.They can’t just say that he’s not participating and instead he wants to go to a Premier soccer game. This is a job, guys.”Patel is known to be a fan of Premier League football and has been seen publicly supporting Liverpool FC, including wearing a club tie at a Senate hearing and celebrating its title win on social media.Furthermore, it was reported that Patel chose to focus on planning social media posts as an immediate response after the assassination of MAGA activist Charlie Kirk last September, according to the senior executive. The White House and the FBI have rejected the report.Last year, Patel was seen tangled in many other controversies, including demanding unnecessary upgrades for his office car, private jet rides to see his girlfriend and singer Alexis Wilkin's concerts, and deploying SWAT teams to accompany a drunk friend home. Kash has rejected all such accusations and says the mainstream media uses false narratives to defame his name and position.","FBI director Kash Patel has been accused of prioritising social activities, including jet skiing and football matches, over official meetings.

Immigrant visa vs non-immigrant visa





The pause of immigrant visas from 75 countries that started from January 21 may add around 50,000 employment-based Green Card quotas in 2027 as family-based Green Card quotas pass on to employment-based the next year if they (family-based) remain unused. This is the only positive takeaway for Green Card applicants from the pause on 75 countries. Immigration experts explained that this happened during Covid also, and as a result, the Priority Dates moved up to 4-5 years.Immigration attorney Emily Neumann said she went through the data of all the countries mentioned on the 75-country list to check how much family-based Green Card quotas they had to calculate how much spillover can be expected next year for employment-based categories. About 67,000 immigrant visas would have been allotted to these 75 countries in the current fiscal year, had the ban not been announced, but as the ban came into effect after the first quarter of this fiscal year (starting from October 1), there would be 50,000 spillover Green Cards if the ban on these 75 countries continue through this fiscal year ending in September 2026.Citing 2024 data, Neumann confirmed that Pakistan had the highest number of family-based Green Card quota (15,000), followed by Bangladesh (8000).Both countries have been put on the immigrant visa ban list.The Trump administration announced a list of 75 countries from which it won't process any immigration visa requests as of now. This ban would be in place until the administration reassesses how much welfare benefits these nationals are using. The list includes: Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Azerbaijan, the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belize, Bhutan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominica, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji, The Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Jamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, North Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Republic of the Congo, Russia, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, and Yemen.The ban is only on immigrant visa which is sought by people who want to live permanently in the US.

‘Rules No Longer Protect': Canada's Carney Blasts Trump Tariffs Over Greenland | FULL SPEECH

US President Donald Trump on Saturday warned Canada and its Prime Minister Mark Carney over making any deals with China. Refering to Carney as ""governor"", he said that US will impose 100 per cent tariffs if Canada makes any such deals.""If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a “Drop Off Port” for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,"" said Trump on Truth Social.Further continuing his jab, he added, ""China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life. If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the USA. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""Earlier, Trump launched a fresh attack on Canada, accusing Ottawa of opposing his proposed “Golden Dome” missile defence system over Greenland while choosing to deepen economic ties with China.“Canada is against The Golden Dome being built over Greenland, even though The Golden Dome would protect Canada,"" he had said, adding, “Instead, they voted in favor of doing business with China, who will ‘eat them up’ within the first year!""Trump’s remarks came after Carney’s visit to Beijing, where he sought to revive economic engagement with China, Canada’s second-largest trading partner after the US. Carney also sharply criticised the US and Western allies during his address at the World Economic Forum in Davos.The China visit led to an agreement to reduce tariffs on select Canadian agricultural exports and introduce quotas on Chinese electric vehicles entering the Canadian market. The understanding could also pave the way for increased Chinese investment in Canada. Marking the first visit by a Canadian leader to China in nearly a decade, the trip included discussions that both sides described as part of a shifting global landscape, with Chinese Premier Xi Jinping welcoming what he called a “turnaround” in bilateral ties.Speaking about the agreement earlier, Carney appeared to reference ongoing US tariff tensions, noting that Canada’s recent dealings with China had been more “predictable” and describing talks with Beijing as “realistic and respectful.”","US President Donald Trump on Saturday warned Canada and its Prime Minister Mark Carney over making any deals with China.

LUCKNOW: What initially started off as a routine cow slaughter seizure on the city’s outskirts spiralled into a dark psychological thriller—one involving betrayal within marriage, burner phones, fake identities and a meticulously scripted attempt to send a man to jail not once, but twice.The mastermind was the woman, whose arrest was earlier attempted inside the High Court premises. “The motive was personal. To pressure her husband into divorcing her,” said police while tracing the plot to a Jan 14 event when acting on a tip-off, allegedly made to Bajrang Dal, police in Kakori intercepted an online porter vehicle near Durgaganj and found 12 kg of beef.The driver disclosed that the delivery was booked in the name of Wasif, a paper factory owner from Aminabad.While Wasif flatly denied placing any such order, the surveillance checks showed that the OTP used to authenticate the delivery was generated on his mobile number. Then came the twist. CCTV footage from Wasif ’s residence showed that, at the precise moment the OTP was used, he was inside the bathroom, while his phone lay unattended outside.“That single frame changed the direction of the entire investigation,” a senior officer said.Investigators soon uncovered that the beef consignment was deliberately planted to frame Wasif. The probe revealed that his wife allegedly conspired with her lover, Amaan, a Bhopal resident, to execute the plan.“Amaan—using the husband’s identity documents- —booked the online porter from Aminabad to Kakori. The beef was transported from Bhopal, concealed inside a cardboard box, and stealthily loaded onto the vehicle. To ensure swift police interception, Amaan allegedly tipped off Bajrang Dal members under a fake identity of Rahul,” said inspector Satish Chandra Rathore of Kakori police station.On Dec 31, Amaan allegedly travelled to Lucknow, where the duo procured a SIM card registered in the name of a roadside beggar. The SIM was used solely to book the consignment. Police also traced the origins of the relationship. The woman and Amaan connected on Instagram in 2022, and what began as casual chats soon turned into an affair.In Sept last year, nearly 20 kg of beef was recovered from a black Mahindra Thar parked at a multi-level parking facility in Hazratganj. Wasif, the registered owner, was arrested and sent to jail. It later emerged that the beef was allegedly planted inside the vehicle early in the morning while Wasif was away.“Wasif came out of jail quickly that time, but wife wanted him behind bars for a longer period. That was when the second, far more sophisticated conspiracy was put into motion,” inspector Rathore said. Police arrested Amaan, while the role of Wasif ’s wife was firmly established during the investigation. “She will be arrested soon,” the inspector added.","Police in Kakori intercepted an online porter vehicle near Durgaganj and found 12 kg of beef.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: BJP-ruled Thiruvananthapuram city corporation slapped a fine of Rs 19.7 lakh on the BJP's own district committee for erecting unauthorised flex boards, banners and party flags in public spaces ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the state capital on Friday. The action followed widespread public complaints and violations of high court orders aimed at preventing the obstruction of pedestrian pathways and misuse of public land for political display.Civic officials said a formal penalty notice was served to BJP Thiruvananthapuram district president Karamana Jayan after the party failed to comply with repeated directives to take down the installations, many of which carried the images of Modi and other senior BJP leaders. These were installed on footpaths, road dividers and other public areas without prior permission, prompting objections from residents and public rights groups.Despite an order from the corporation on Thursday evening that demanded the banners be removed within two hours, compliance was only partial, officials said. While a few boards blocking footpaths were taken down, numerous others remained in place, leading the civic body to carry out a detailed survey of unauthorised installations along major stretches from Thiruvananthapuram airport to Putharikandam Maidan, a key route in the PM's itinerary.Based on this assessment, the fine was calculated and issued.In addition to the fine, the matter was escalated to law enforcement. The Cantonment police registered an FIR late Friday night against Jayan, based on a complaint filed by the corporation secretary. According to the FIR, the flex boards and banners were installed including from Palayam junction to Pulimoodu junction. The case was registered under relevant sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and the Kerala Police Act.Corporation secretary Jahamgeer S told TOI that the action was not politically motivated. ""This is a routine process,"" he said, noting that the civic body previously imposed fines on other institutions, political parties and govt units for similar violations. ""This is not the first time a political party was fined. We fined the CPM when it was in power and recently penalised the PRD too. These actions are based on high court orders, not politics,"" he added.The high court on Friday expressed strong displeasure over the continued installation of unauthorised boards and flags in public spaces across the state, describing the practice as ""shocking and disturbing"" despite earlier judicial orders to curb it. The court stressed that visible on-ground compliance, not just verbal assurances, must be evident to uphold pedestrian rights and prevent misuse of civic amenities. Authorities were directed to file detailed enforcement reports.","BJP-ruled Thiruvananthapuram city corporation slapped a fine of Rs 19.7 lakh on the BJP's own district committee for erecting unauthorised flex boards, banners and party flags.

MANGALURU: Residents of a remote village near Dharmasthala were briefly gripped by panic on Saturday after a strange aerial object with foreign markings landed in an agricultural field near Puthila post office, prompting locals to alert the police.However, assurance came from Sajeev R, scientist at the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Mangaluru, who confirmed the object as a GPS Sonde -- a routine meteorological instrument released daily for upper-air observations.""A GPS Sonde is released around 4.30 am from the Mangaluru Doppler Weather Radar station, using a weather balloon filled with hydrogen gas. It collects data on upper-air temperature, humidity, wind direction, wind speed, and other atmospheric parameters. Such data is crucial for aviation, military operations, and atmospheric activities,"" Sajeev explained.According to IMD officials, the instrument usually descends after completing its observation cycle and may land either in the Arabian Sea or on land. On Saturday, it fell on a farmland near Dharmasthala, alarming residents who noticed the device carrying a sticker reading ‘Malaysian Met Department'.Sajeev clarified that the equipment is imported and still carries the original sticker, though it is fully owned and operated by IMD.""There is absolutely no need for the public to panic. It is not harmful and contains only a battery, sensors, and GPS equipment. However, if the balloon reaches a leaking stage, people should stay away from it,"" he cautioned.He further said GPS Sonde is a one-time-use instrument and is usually not retrieved.

MUMBAI: A minor argument over getting off a local train turned fatal on Saturday evening when a junior college teacher was stabbed to death inside a Borivali-bound local train as it approached Malad railway station.The victim, Alok Kumar Singh (33), was travelling from Vile Parle to Malad when a dispute broke out with a co-passenger just before 6 pm over alighting from the crowded compartment. What began as a verbal exchange escalated suddenly into violence.“Everything happened suddenly. The accused stabbed him with a sharp object in the stomach, got off the train and escaped,” a police official said.Singh was rushed to Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital in Kandivali, where doctors declared him dead on arrival. “The patient was brought dead around 6pm. He had knife injuries,” said a doctor at the hospital.Singh had been working as a junior college faculty member at Narsee Monjee College of Commerce and Economics since 2024, teaching mathematics and statistics. A colleague described him as calm and non-confrontational. “He was a kind soul, calm and polite and never used to get involved in arguments or fights. In fact, he used to help in resolving fights.This is absolutely shocking for us,” the teacher said, adding that Singh had left college for home between 5.15 pm and 5.30 pm.Initially, the attacker was unidentified. Police said there were witnesses inside the train compartment who saw the accused and overheard the argument. “We have witnesses from the train compartment who saw the accused and overheard the argument. We are quizzing them and recording their statements. CCTV footage from Malad and previous railway stations is being scanned,” a police official said.Forensic experts later collected evidence from Malad station, and a canine squad was pressed into service. The Borivali Government Railway Police (GRP) registered a case of murder against an unknown person under provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.Singh lived in Malad East with his wife and had been married for only a few years. A relative expressed shock over the incident. “He was a simple person and we had never seen him get angry over anything. He got married only a couple of years ago and lived in Malad East with his wife. His father worked for BJP leader Rajnath Singh jn Delhi. His uncle was also a teacher. We are aghast at what has happened and want police to track down the culprit at the earliest. ”Local BJP leaders visited the hospital late on Saturday night as the family struggled to come to terms with how a routine commute ended in tragedy.On Sunday, the GRP arrested Omkar Shinde in connection with the murder. Police said further inquiries are underway to determine the sequence of events and the weapon used in the attack. Investigators confirmed that Singh sustained a single deep stab injury to the abdomen.","Alok Kumar Singh (33) was travelling from Vile Parle to Malad when a dispute broke out with a co-passenger over alighting from the crowded compartment.

The Viral Video







AMRITSAR: Ghaziabad resident Subhan Rangrez — the man seen in the viral video allegedly rinsing his mouth in sacred Sarovar of Golden Temple on Jan 13 — was arrested and sent to judicial custody following an altercation at his residence involving a group of Nihangs on Saturday. Meanwhile, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has also filed a formal complaint against Subhan.A video uploaded on the social media handle of Akali Jasvinder Singh — titled ""Singha nae lita insasf, quom naal jine matha laya hai onu kisi ne nahi chadya"" (Singhs have taken justice; whoever has dared to challenge the community has never been spared) — appears to show a Nihang slapping a person believed to be Subhan, though this could not be independently verified. In another video, a person claims that a formal complaint was lodged at the Ankur Vihar police station in Ghaziabad.When contacted, assistant commissioner of police (ACP, Ankur Vihar) Gyan Prakash Rai said a group of people went to Subhan's residence, leading to an altercation. The police intervened, arrested Subhan, filed a challan, and sent him to judicial custody.‘Friends only recorded video, did not pay obesiance'Rajinder Singh Ruby, manager of the Golden Temple, who lodged the formal complaint against Subhan under Section 298 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) at Division E police station, alleged that Subhan visited the temple with a group of five people.According to him, one person recorded the video of Subhan while performing ‘wudu' in the holy Sarovar, while three others stood nearby. Ruby added that the group remained at the Golden Temple for about 20 minutes without offering obeisance, suggesting that their sole intention was to record the video during the ritual.Notably, on Jan 13, Subhan, in a viral video, was seen rinsing his mouth in sacred Sarovar at Golden Temple, an act of violation of maryada (Sikh code of religious conduct).Following the backlash, Subhan — who posted a reel identifying himself as ""Muslim Sher"" — issued an apology, stating that he was unaware of the Golden Temple maryada and no one present there informed him about it. His apology was also rejected by some Sikh groups, stating in a video that Subhan kept his hands in his pockets, which was also ""disrespectful and not in accordance with maryada"", following which Subhan apologised again with folded hands.However, some Sikh organisations sought the registration of a complaint against him in his hometown and ""teach him a lesson"".","Ghaziabad resident Subhan Rangrez was arrested and sent to judicial custody following an altercation at his residence. Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has also filed a formal complaint against Subhan. A video appears to show a Nihang slapping a person believed to be Subhan, though this could not be independently verified.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127437716,imgsize-87450,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/golden-temple.jpg"

PATNA: In a fresh development in the mysterious death of an 18-year-old medical aspirant in Patna, the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) submitted its biological report to the police on Saturday, indicating the possibility of sexual assault on the victim. The report detected the presence of male semen on the student’s clothes, which she wore at the time of hospitalisation.This finding strongly suggests sexual assault and harassment. A senior police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the FSL report pointed towards sexual assault.An FSL source said, “Semen was found in the leggings, which the police handed over to the team, indicating that something wrong happened with the girl. There is a strong possibility of sexual assault. However, the exact timing of the incident cannot be determined from this report alone. The DNA profiling is still pending. If the sperm sample is not degraded, a DNA profile can be generated, which may reveal whether one or more persons were involved. ”The revelation corroborates and strengthens earlier post-mortem observations at Patna Medical College Hospital, where injuries consistent with possible sexual violence were detected and assault could not be ruled out.The report also highlighted injuries to her private parts and nail abrasions on her body.The victim, from Jehanabad and preparing for NEET, resided in a girls’ hostel in Patna. She was found unconscious in her locked room on Jan 6 and died on Jan 11 while undergoing treatment at a private hospital.The case has drawn widespread attention, student protests, and a suo motu notice from the Bihar State Women’s Commission. Bihar DGP Vinay Kumar ordered Patna range IG Jitendra Rana to investigate the matter, leading to the formation of a special investigation team (SIT) on Jan 16, headed by Patna SP (east) Parichay Kumar.The investigation so far has recovered the victim’s diary, revealing exam stress, family disputes, a past relationship and previous suicidal thoughts. Her phone contained deleted chats and searches related to poisons and sleeping pills. Traces of sleeping pills were confirmed in her urine. The SIT also traced the source of the sleeping pills the girl ingested before she was found unconscious, along with three empty strips of the medicine.The team has examined her movements in Jehanabad and Patna, questioned family members and relatives, and is awaiting DNA results and AIIMS analysis.The forensic team at AIIMS-Patna has stated that it will hold off on delivering a final expert opinion until all necessary documents and medical reports are fully provided by the SIT.Dr Vinay Kumar, from the forensic medicine and toxicology department of AIIMS-Patna, said, “The police have shared some documents with the executive director of the institute, accompanied by a request for an expert medical board to review them and provide an informed opinion. The medical board is currently reviewing what it has received and has requested additional materials from the SIT that are still required. ”“The SIT is cooperating and providing whatever is available. For the documents they do not have, they are actively trying to obtain them,” Dr Kumar added.","Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) submitted its biological report to the police on Saturday.

Tension grips Bhagirathpura again: Elderly’s death sparks protest; kin blame contaminated water,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/indore-tragedy-elderlys-death-sparks-protest-kin-blame-contaminated-water/articleshow/127421650.cms,"





INDORE: Tensions flared in the Bhagirathpura area on Saturday following the death of an elderly resident, with family members and local residents blaming contaminated water while officials cited chronic illness.Aggrieved residents placed the body of the deceased on the road and staged a blockade raising slogans against the local BJP corporators and the local administration. The blockade caused traffic congestion on the road near Bhagirathpura Bridge for nearly 90 minutes.The deceased has been identified as Badri Prashad.The family alleged that despite a lapse of 24 hours since the death, no senior official visited them. Badri Prashad's son Shailendra said the family was struggling with extreme poverty and lacked funds for the final rites. He also said his wife, Kanchan, passed away 2 months ago during a similar period of water contamination issues in the area.""The administration refuses to link these deaths to the water, but my father was healthy before this sudden illness,"" he claimed.Congress leaders, including leader of opposition in Indore municipal corporation, Chintu Choukse and Congress corporator Raju Bhadoriya, joined the sit-in and demanded immediate financial assistance for the family.The blockade was lifted after SDM Nidhi Verma and ACP Vinod Dixit reached the spot. The SDM assured the family that clean drinking water supply would be prioritised in the area. She also said a formal proposal for financial assistance would be sent to the govt based on a detailed medical report from the CMHO regarding the deaths of Badri Prasad and Kanchan. After two deaths were reported recently in the diarrhoea-affected Bhagirathpura area, chief medical and health officer Dr Madhav Hasani issued a statement saying Badri Prasad's death was not caused by waterborne diseases. Dr Hasani said the patient had chronic Tuberculosis (TB), diabetes and hypertension, along with a past angioplasty.""He was admitted to Aurobindo Hospital due to respiratory distress. Based on currently available medical facts, the probable cause of his death is considered to be his chronic and serious pre-existing illnesses. No direct link was found between his death and any type of waterborne disease,"" the CMHO said. Dr Hasani also addressed the death of 82-year-old Vidyabai, who died on Thursday. While she reported vomiting and diarrhoea on Jan 10, officials said her death followed a hip fracture from a fall and other age-related complications. ""Linking these deaths to contaminated water solely based on complaints of vomiting and diarrhoea is scientifically incorrect,"" Dr Hasani added.Currently, 10 patients from Bhagirathpura remain hospitalised with waterborne symptoms, with 1 on a ventilator and 1 in the ICU. The IMC is laying new main pipelines in 70% of the area to prevent further contamination, while the remaining 30% is being supplied with tested water via tankers or alternate-day Narmada supply.",Tensions flared in the Bhagirathpura area on Saturday following the death of an elderly resident.

‘She learned not to cry’: Neighbours say daughter’s tears made father angrier; recall how she suffered in silence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/four-year-old-girl-beaten-to-death-over-maths-lesson-was-thrashed-regularly-by-father/articleshow/127416982.cms,"Gurgaon Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know.







FARIDABAD: Four-year-old Vanshika Jaiswal, who was allegedly beaten to death by her father for getting a maths writing assignment wrong, was no stranger to thrashing, according to neighbours in Jharsentli.They alleged that her father Krishna Jaiswal, a private firm employee, would slap and scold her for even trivial issues whenever he came home drunk. The little one had, in fact, conditioned herself to absorb the shock and not cry in front of her father, who would get even more angry seeing her tears, the neighbours alleged.On Wednesday, Vanshika was repeatedly struck with a rolling pin and slammed onto the floor by Krishna because she failed to do a writing assignment properly. Krishna, who took a bleeding Vanshika to hospital but claimed she had fallen off the stairs, was arrested on a complaint by her mother.""He would beat her every day. She would not cry in front of her father because he was an addict. He consumed liquor and drugs. When her father was home, she had to study,"" said Anshu Kumari, Vanshika's cousin and a Class 3 student.Vanshika, Anshu said, was a quiet child who rarely complained.""Bahut masoom thi (she was too innocent). We would play every day after school,"" she said, adding that Vanshika often spoke about her future during their games. ""She used to say she wanted to become a police officer when she grows up.""Neighbours described a home where fear shaped the daily life of Vanshika and her brother. ""They wouldn't roam outside like our children. Their play was restricted to the complex. They were too scared of their father,"" said Seema Devi, who lives in the same settlement rented largely by migrant workers from UP and Bihar.Siddhant, an eight-year-old neighbour, said Vanshika did household chores well beyond her age. ""Pari (her nickname) did all the domestic work. She washed utensils, swept, and mopped. And when her father returned, she had to study as well,"" he added.Guddu Yadav, a neighbour and labour contractor, echoed that. ""She was such a small child, but she did all the household chores. My children are older than her, but they won't do these things. She was very responsible, just like her name, Pari,"" he said.Neighbours alleged Krishna's drinking was routine. ""Vanshika's father drank daily. That was his routine. But it was only after Vanshika's death, when her mother gave a statement to police, that we understood the extent of the torture they endured,"" Yadav said.""Pari's mother told police that he didn't just drink. She said he used to eat bhang ka gola. Not 1, but 6,"" he added.Seema Devi, another neighbour, said she often tried to stop the child from working in the cold. ""I used to tell her, ‘don't wash utensils, it's cold. Your mother will come,'"" she said. ""But she would still do it. Her mother went for duty daily in the day shift, and her father used to drink every day.""Police said both parents worked for a private firm in alternating shifts, with the mother on day duty and the father working nights and staying home during the day. Vanshika was not enrolled in school and was taught at home by her father.According to neighbours, the morning Vanshika died began routinely. Her mother, Ranjita, left for work as usual around 8am. ""Before leaving, Vanshika asked for food. Her mother said her father would give her food,"" Siddhant said.Instead, neighbours alleged, Krishna asked the child to complete a writing assignment and then left the house to drink. ""When he came back, she was already asleep. He was so angry that he started thrashing her,"" Siddhant said.","Vanshika Jaiswal, 4, was allegedly beaten to death by her father for getting a maths writing assignment wrong.

BHUBANESWAR/CUTTACK: Failing to raise enough money to hire an ambulance to take his wife to a hospital, a 70-year-old man in Odisha pedalled 300 km in a rickshaw van from Sambalpur to Cuttack for her treatment and is now on their way back in the same fashion, defying old age and bone-chilling cold.""I have two loves in my life. One is my wife whom I am taking back home, and the other is my rickshaw van. I cannot leave either of them,"" a proud Babu Lohar said, as he pedalled across the highway, refusing help from the police or locals.Lohar's journey highlights the harsh realities faced by the poor and elderly in accessing basic healthcare and transport facilities, even as it stood as a powerful testament to unwavering marital devotion. Govt authorities are yet to react on the story that has become a talking point on the internet.In Nov last year, Lohar's wife, Jyoti suffered a paralytic stroke and local health centre officials in Sambalpur's Modipada, where the couple reside, referred them to the state-run SCB Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack.""I did not have money to hire any vehicle, so I took out my rickshaw van. I put some old cushions on the rickshaw and let my wife lie on them.I pedalled chanting God's name,"" said Lohar, a rickshaw puller by profession.After nine days, covering 30 km by the day and halting near roadside shops by the night, he reached the Cuttack hospital. After two months of prolonged treatment, Lohar resumed his journey back home to Modipada on Jan 19, this year.Another twist in fate saw the couple meeting with a minor accident near Choudwar under Tangi Police Station in Cuttack district.A vehicle brushed the rickshaw while overtaking, and Jyoti fell on the road and hit her head, but Lohar did not sustain any injury.He took Jyoti to the local Tangi community health centre to put a bandage on the injured area.The local hospital provided the food and allowed them to stay overnight to avoid the cold, and they resumed the journey to Sambalpur on the morning of January 20.On the highway, Tangi police station officer in-charge Bikash Sethi spotted the elderly man pulling the rickshaw with his wife lying on it. The officer tried to persuade Lohar to allow the cops to arrange a vehicle for safe transport, but he refused to take any help.""I offered to arrange a vehicle for them considering the woman's health and the man's age, but he politely refused,"" said Sethi. ""His determination and emotional attachment are deeply moving. I haven't seen anything like this ever,"" Sethi said on Saturday.""Lohar said he does not have any family members except his wife and the rickshaw. After our repeated requests, he accepted some cash from us to eat food on the way to Sambalpur,"" he added.",A 70-year-old man in Odisha pedalled 300 km in a rickshaw van from Sambalpur to Cuttack for his wife's treatment.
