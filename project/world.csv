"Village answers trunk calls, saves jumbos",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/village-answers-trunk-calls-saves-jumbos/articleshow/116269817.cms,"Villagers in Assam's Jorhat district rescued four wild elephants, including a calf, trapped in a pond.

DIBRUGARH: A trunk call is loaded with meaning - could be an admonitory don't-mess-with-me, or an SOS. Village headman Hem Chandra Borah froze mid-step around 6.10pm Wednesday as a piercing cry shattered the quiet at Khamjongia in Assam's Jorhat district - a sound both alien and sorrowful. There was no mistaking it: the elephants were in trouble.Four wild elephants, including a calf, had strayed from their herd and found themselves trapped in a large, deep pond. The animals thrashed, their efforts to climb slippery slopes thwarted at every turn. With each failed attempt, their trumpeting grew more desperate, and the calf's distress struck a particularly harrowing chord.""When we rushed to the site, we found the elephants struggling to climb out. The forest officials suggested waiting for an excavator, but we knew time was critical. Especially for the calf, which was visibly exhausted, waiting wasn't an option,"" Borah said.Determined to save the animals, the villagers quickly gathered tools such as hoes, shovels, and spades. Men, women, and even children worked tirelessly to dig a makeshift path along the pond's edge, forming a slope the elephants could use to escape.Hour by hour, inch by inch, the slope took shape. The calf, shivering and drained, watched from the water's edge as if sensing the monumental effort being made for its life. By 10.15pm, the young calf scrambled up the slope. The remaining elephants, one after another, followed.""It was a moment of pure joy when they finally walked free,"" said Ujjal Baruah, a resident who participated in the rescue. ""Though the elephants were limping, we were relieved to see them without major injuries. If we hadn't acted quickly, the calf might not have survived the night.""When the last giant heaved itself onto solid ground, an almost reverent silence fell over the crowd. The elephants, their mud-slicked bodies glistening in the pale light, lingered for a moment as if acknowledging their rescuers. Then, with slow, deliberate steps, they vanished into the dark embrace of the forest.","Villagers in Assam's Jorhat district rescued four wild elephants, including a calf, trapped in a pond.

Man flies down from Kuwait to kill daughter's molester,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/man-flies-down-from-kuwait-to-kill-daughters-molester/articleshow/116265436.cms,"Representative image

TIRUPATI: An enraged father flew down from Kuwait and murdered a man, who allegedly molested his 12-year-old daughter. He released a selfie video from Kuwait on Thursday confessing to the murder.The alleged killer, who works as a labourer in Kuwait, came down to his native village near Obulavaripalli of Annamayya district in Andhra Pradesh and allegedly stabbed his daughter's molester with a knife on Dec 7, killing him on the spot. He later flew back to Kuwait.In the video, the man said that both his wife and he work in Kuwait. They had left their minor daughter with his sister-in-law and her husband. He alleged that while everything was fine in the beginning, recently his sister-in-law's father-in-law molested his daughter.""When my daughter resisted, he tried to gag her but somehow she managed to raise an alarm and my wife's sister rushed to the room and saved her,"" the NRI said in the video. Although the family allegedly threatened the girl and tried to hush up the matter, the girl shared her ordeal with her mother during a recent visit.""My wife and I first decided not to take the law into our own hands,"" he added in the video. ""I asked my wife to go to police station and she lodged a complaint. Police summoned the molester and my wife's sister and merely reprimanded them without taking action,"" he alleged.""When my wife once again went to the police station and complained about the man and his family, the police did not react and instead threatened to file a case against my wife,"" he claimed. He said he wanted to fight legally against the accused, but police inaction forced him to take the law into his hands. In the video he expressed a willingness to surrender.Police sub-inspector P Mahesh refuted the allegation and stated that no complaint was lodged by the girl's mother. ""The girl's mother and her sister have family disputes,"" the officer claimed. ""There is a criminal conspiracy behind the murder and apart from the girl's father, his other family are also involved in the murder. We will soon bring to light all the facts.""The SI alleged that the girl's father was trying to mislead people by releasing the video. ""If he intended to surrender, why did he return to Kuwait?"" he asked.","The alleged killer, who works as a labourer in Kuwait, came down to his native village near Obulavaripalli of Annamayya district in Andhra Pradesh.

VARANASI: Following a controversy over waqf board's claim on the land of a mosque situated on the campus of Varanasi's Uday Pratap College , the masjid is now under double lock.Protesting students have put a lock at the mosque gates and handed over the keys to the college administration , even though the mosque management committee had already locked the gates earlier.Principal D K Singh on Thursday said the keys to the second lock were with the security personnel of the college. ""If the administration decides, the mosque will be opened. Our security staff has the keys, and the lock was put to prevent accusations of theft from the mosque premises,"" Singh said.The mosque became the centre of a row when a 2018 UP Sunni Waqf Board notice to the college, which said the mosque and its land were waqf property, started circulating on social media. More than 500 Muslims gathered on Nov 29 to offer Friday prayers, as against the usual scant footfall. On Dec 3, college students recited Hanuman Chalisa 50 metres away from the mosque, and said they would continue to do so if Muslims prayed at the mosque.Amid protests, police halted prayers. The college had rejected the waqf board's claim within days of getting the notice in 2018. The board, too, clarified that it had withdrawn its notice. However, since Dec 3, those who wished to offer namaz have been denied entry to the campus.","Protesting students put a lock at the mosque gates and handed over the keys to the college administration.

Was Guilfoyle fired from Fox over sexual harassment?

Timeline of Guilfoyle's relationship with Don Jr



Just ahead of the election, Kimberly Guilfoyle floated an old story from her career days that involved Kamala Harris. As Guilfoyle continued to fire salvos at Harris, she recounted her personal story that Kamala Haris once stopped her from getting a job in the San Francisco district attorney's office. This happened over 20 years ago but Guilfoyle's grudge did not become blunt though Guilfoyle ultimately got the job.55-year-old Guilfoyle is almost a contemporary of Harris and their field being the same Guilfoyle's personal story added fire to Donald Trump's campaign against Harris. Guilfoyle did not continue that job for long as she got married to Democrat Gavin Newson in 2001 who was then the mayor of San Francisco. They split in 2006 when Guilfoyle got married to businessman Eric Villency. They broke up in 2009. At that time, Guilfoyle was working with the Fox News.Guilfoyle left Fox in 2018 and joined America First Policies, a Trump super PAC to campaign for Republicans in the 2018 midterm elections. But at that time she was already dating Donald Trump Jr . And according to reports, she was fired from Fox over a sexual harassment accusation from a female assistant. Reports said Fox had been in the middle of a year-long investigation into the allegation when she left.The allegation against her was that she called her assistant to her apartment and ""displayed herself naked"", and showed her photographs of the genitalia of men she'd had sexual relations with. The allegation resulted in Foc News agreeing to a $4 million dollar out-of-court settlement, reports said. Guilfoyle denied any wrongdoing. On her part, the reason for leaving Fox News was a conflict of interest as she was dating Don Jr.Guilfoyle and Don Jr have been together since 2018 and they got engaged in 2020. The relationship launched Guilfoyle as a MAGA voice that matters as she was seen at all Trump events, delivering speeches at Republican National Conventions.On several occasions and as recent as in September, Guilfoyle referred to Donald Trump as 'father-in-law' in a public speech. But that was the last time, she called Donald Trump father-in-law in public as it was in the same month that Don Jr was first spotted canoodling with Bettina Anderson, a Palm Beach socialite leading to rumors of a breakup between Don Jr and Guilfoyle.But on election night, Guilfoyle and Don Jr were seen together side by side -- Bettina was also there.Don Jr and Guilfoyle were not seen together since November 12 and on December 9, Don Jr was seen celebrating Bettina's birthday and then Donald Trump announced Guilfoyle as the Greece ambassador.","Kimberly Guilfoyle floated an old story from her career days that involved Kamala Harris.

NEW DELHI: An FIR has been registered against four people in connection with the suicide of 34-year-old Bengaluru techie Atul Subhash, who accused his wife, her relatives and a judge of harassment, extortion and corruption before his death.Based on a complaint by Atul's brother Bikas Kumar at the Marathahalli police station in Bengaluru, the FIR includes charges under section 108 and section 3(5) of the BNS. The accused are Nikita Singhania (wife), Nisha Singhania (mother-in-law), Anurag Singhania (brother-in-law) and Sushil Singhania (wife's uncle).Subhash, employed at a private company, left a detailed 24-page note describing years of emotional distress from marital problems. In his suicide note, he accused a family court judge in Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh, of dismissing his pleas and alleged that a court officer accepted bribes openly.""I want my brother to get justice. I want this country to have a legal process through which even men can get justice. I want strict action against those who are sitting on a legal chair and doing corruption because if this continues then how will people expect justice,"" his brother Bikas told PTI.Bikas expressed concerns about systemic corruption, noting that justice requires an unbiased system where all parties receive fair hearings based on facts.""....can expect justice only when decisions are made on the basis of facts and if it does not happen, then people will slowly start losing faith in judicial system. It may lead to a situation where people may get afraid to get married. Men may start feeling that if they get married, they will just end up being an ATM machine for vending money,"" he said.Authorities found Subhash's body at his Manjunath Layout residence on Monday, with a placard stating ""Justice is due.""He recorded an 80-minute video on Rumble explaining his decision, which subsequently went viral.""I feel that I should kill myself because the money I earn is making my enemies stronger. That same money will be used to destroy me, and this cycle will keep going,"" Subhash stated in the video.His uncle, Pawan Kumar, alleged harassment over financial demands, stating the family initially requested Rs 40,000 monthly, which increased to Rs 1 lakh.""His wife even said that he should commit suicide if he cannot pay the amount to which the judge also laughed. This really hurt him,"" PTI quoted Kumar as saying.Sushil Kumar, Nikita's uncle, denied involvement, stating, ""I came to know that I am also named in the FIR. I am innocent. I wasn't even there. We got to know about his suicide through media. None of our family members were present at the scene of incident. There's a case going on in the court for the last three years and in this duration, we did not have any communication with him or his family. We are not at fault. Case is going on... Court will decide and give the verdict.""Police investigations revealed ongoing marital disputes and a case filed against Subhash in Uttar Pradesh. Before his death, he distributed his note via email and shared it with an NGO WhatsApp group. The death note reportedly mentions that Subhash got married in 2019 and that the couple had a son the following year.""In July, the family court at Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh directed Atul to pay a monthly maintenance of Rs 40,000 towards his son. The court did not ask Atul to compensate his wife since she was earning decently in Delhi. Atul was earning a monthly salary of Rs 84,000. Perhaps, Atul might have thought Rs 40,000 was a little expensive for him. But he could have appealed in higher courts, including high court, against the orders. It is an unfortunate incident,"" said advocate Dinesh Mishra.Mishra told mediapersons at Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh that the orders passed by the court were in accordance with the law.","Atul Subhash, 34, left a detailed 24-page note describing years of emotional distress from marital problems.

RIP. Thank you, Mr. Mangione, for your sacrifice.""Messages on the fundraising page read slogans like “Deny, Defend, Depose,” reportedly found on shell casings at the murder site, referring to alleged insurance tactics to avoid payouts. Meanwhile, Mangione merchandise, including hats and T-shirts bearing phrases like “CEO Hunter” and “FREE LUIGI,” has surfaced online.Felipe Rodriguez, a former NYPD detective sergeant, criticised the public response. “They’ve made him a martyr for all the troubles people have had with their own insurance companies,” he said. “But he’s a stone-cold killer.”Mangione, who reportedly suffered from chronic back pain, remains in custody in Pennsylvania on gun and forgery charges while prosecutors in New York pursue extradition. His lawyer has said that he plans to plead not guilty to the charges.Some social media users have praised Mangione’s actions, with TikTok videos calling him a “legend” and backing his courtroom outburst against corporate greed. However, others have condemned the killing, seeing it as a dangerous rise in anti-capitalist views and left-wing propaganda.Mangione, an Ivy League graduate, is charged with shooting Thompson outside a Manhattan hotel on December 4, then fleeing and avoiding capture for five days. Police say they have matched the gun found with Mangione to shell casings at the scene and connected his fingerprints to nearby evidence.The 26-year-old has become a debated figure, seen by some as a folk hero, celebrity, and crush, dividing opinions across the United States.","Donations have surged for Luigi Mangione's legal defence after his arrest for killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last week.

PALAKKAD: Four girl students, all 13-year-olds and close friends, were killed after a truck overturned on them at Panayambadam near Kalladikode here on Thursday evening. The deceased are Irfana Sherin, Ritha Fathima, Nitha Fathima, and Ayisha AS, natives of nearby Cherully and Class VIII students of Govt Higher Secondary School, Karimba.Police said the accident occurred on the Kozhikode-Palakkad highway around 4 pm. ""The cement-laden truck, travelling towards Mannarkkad, lost control while trying to avoid collision with another vehicle coming from the opposite direction. It toppled and crashed onto a group of students who were walking home after attending an examination. While four students were trapped beneath the vehicle, one managed to escape unharmed. Despite swift action by rescue workers who lifted the truck and rushed students to a nearby hospital, all four were declared dead upon arrival,"" a police officer said.According to Kongad MLA Santhakumari, who visited the spot immediately after the accident, the truck had hit the other vehicle before moving towards the students.“The rescue operation proved challenging, as a crane and an earthmover had to be used to extract students from underneath the vehicle. Scores of residents assisted in the rescue efforts by removing the cement bags from the truck. Three students were quickly retrieved, but it took considerable effort to take out the remaining student,” she said.Police have taken the driver and cleaner of the truck into custody. The bodies have been shifted to Palakkad district hospital and they will be handed over to relatives after autopsy. Police officers who inspected the site said they would check CCTV visuals to ascertain the reason for the accident. They said the vehicle was found in good condition.Meanwhile, the accident triggered a public protest in the area, with residents blocking the highway for more than an hour demanding steps to prevent frequent accidents on the stretch. The protest ended only after Power minister V Krishnankutty, who visited the spot, assured them that he would convene a meeting with the district collector on Friday to discuss measures needed.Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in his condolence message that a detailed investigation would be conducted into the accident and necessary action would be taken. Transport minister KB Ganesh Kumar said the transport commissioner would conduct a detailed probe.“A comprehensive investigation is essential to determine the exact cause of the accident. Various factors — including wet road conditions, driving under the influence of alcohol or reckless driving — could have contributed to it,” he said.General education minister V Sivankutty has also sought a detailed report on the accident from the district collector. Palakkad MLA Rahul Mamkootathil also visited the accident spot.","Four girl students, all 13-year-olds and close friends, were killed after a truck overturned on them.

Some suggested cutting off energy supplies and highlighted other products for which the US ""relies on"" Canada.Trudeau met with Canada's premiers on Wednesday to discuss Ottawa's plan to address Trump's concerns. This was the second meeting since Trump threatened to impose steep tariffs on Canadian imports after he was sworn in as President in January, CBC News reported.Canada's finance minister, Chrystia Freeland, who was at Wednesday's meeting, said some premiers are in favour of a robust response to threatened US tariffs, CBC News reported. She also took suggestions from premiers on which products to target if retaliatory tariffs become necessary.""Some premiers proactively identified products that their provinces produce and export to the United States -- and which the US relies on -- and which should be considered as part of the Canadian response,"" she said.Further, Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who is currently the chair of the Council of the Federation, stated that the meeting was a ""good start,"" as Canada needs to be ready to fight Trump's tariffs. ""Canada needs to be ready to fight and that Trump's tariffs are 100 per cent coming. Folks, this is coming ... it's coming January 20 or 21, and we need to be prepared. We need to stand as a country,"" he stressed.In a bold statement, Ford said that Canada could cut off energy supplies to the US as Canada sends a significant amount of oil, natural gas, and electricity south of the border. ""We will go to the extent of cutting off their energy,"" he declared. ""I don't want this to happen, but my number one job is to protect Ontario, Ontarians, and Canadians as a whole,"" he added.Notably, Trump announced plans to impose steep tariffs on Canadian goods last month. According to CBC News, Trump has threatened to impose 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods unless both countries address what he describes as an ""invasion"" of drugs, particularly fentanyl, and all ""illegal aliens"" into the US.The US imported a significant amount of goods from Canada in recent years. In 2022, the total value of these imports was USD 614.3 billion, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. More recent data from the US Census Bureau shows that between January and September of this year, the US imported around USD 435 billion worth of goods from Canada.","US President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose steep tariffs on Canadian imports.

A few weeks ago residents of New Jersey spotted unidentified drones in the skies, some believing it was a UFO but the authorities still have no clue.Rep. Jeff Van Drew, who along with R-N J suggested that unmanned aerial vehicles could be Iranian 'mothership,' contested this on Fox News that, ""We aren't being told the truth. They are dealing with the American public like we're stupid.""Dismissing the case of the possibility of an Iranian ""mothership"" being responsible, White House spokesperson John Kirby said that the Coast Guard has confirmed that there is no evidence of any foreign-based involvement from coastal vessels.In a presser, Kirby said, ""We have no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat or have a foreign nexus. The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI are investigating these sightings, and they’re working closely with state and local law enforcement to provide resources, using numerous detection methods to better understand their origin.""""Using very sophisticated electronic detection technologies provided by federal authorities, we have not been able to — and neither have state or local law enforcement authorities — corroborate any of the reported visual sightings. To the contrary, upon review of available imagery, it appears that many of the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft that are being operated lawfully,"" he added.He also noted that the US authorities is taking the threat seriously that can be posed by unmanned aircraft systems and that is why law enforcement and other agencies continue to support New Jersey and investigate the reports, ""even though they have uncovered no malicious activity or intent at this particular stage.""Kirby urged Congress to pass important legislation that will extend and expand existing counter-drone authorities so that the authorities are better prepared to identify and mitigate any potential threats to airports or other critical infrastructure and so that state and local authorities are provided all the tools that they need to respond to such threats as well.Earlier, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh stated, ""There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there's no so-called mothership launching drones towards the United States.""She further noted there is ""no evidence"" suggesting foreign adversary involvement.While the Pentagon denies foreign involvement, the FBI has expressed concern about their limited knowledge. During a Congressional hearing on Tuesday, FBI Assistant Director Robert Wheeler acknowledged uncertainty about potential risks.The FBI later suggested to Fox News Digital that the sightings might not be drones at all. A spokesperson explained they lack evidence of national security threats or foreign connections, noting that many reported sightings appear to be lawful manned aircraft.The drones have been observed near sensitive locations, including a military research facility. Doug Birkey, executive director of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, highlighted outdated detection systems as a potential issue in tracking these objects.The sightings began on November 18, with nightly observations continuing until about 11 p.m. Reports vary from four to 180 sightings per night. According to state Rep. Dawn Fantasia, the objects are ""six feet in diameter"" and operate in coordination with lights off.New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy maintains there is no public safety threat. However, similar incidents have occurred previously, including drone sightings near Langley Air Force Base last year and the Chinese spy balloon incident.Pramod Abichandani, an NJIT drone expert, noted these operations violate numerous FAA regulations. The situation remains unresolved, with some officials, including Fantasia, calling for military intervention.","Residents of New Jersey spotted unidentified drones in the skies, some believing it was a UFO but the authorities still have no clue.

US Planning to bring Timmerman back



A US man, detained for months in a Syrian prison after entering the country, has finally become a free bird as rebels overthrew the regime of Bashar al-Assad.On Thursday, a man identifying himself as Travis Timmerman was found in Syria following his release from imprisonment. In a conversation with CBS News, Timmerman explained his attempts to exit the country after his prison release. He disclosed that his detention occurred seven months prior when he entered Syria without authorisation after spending a month in Lebanon.""My door was busted down, it woke me up,"" Timmerman recounted of his Monday release by two armed men. ""I thought the guards were still there, so I thought the warfare could have been more active than it ended up being… Once we got out, there was no resistance, there was no real fighting.""Timmerman revealed his religious motivations for visiting Syria and described his imprisonment as relatively tolerable. He noted that whilst he avoided physical abuse, bathroom access was restricted to thrice daily.Following his release, Timmerman departed with others and began walking, aiming towards Jordan. He acknowledged experiencing brief moments of anxiety upon leaving prison, though he hadn't fully processed his freedom, focusing instead on securing nightly accommodation.He expressed feeling comfortable seeking assistance from locals, who often approached him first. Timmerman mentioned previous communication with his family three weeks ago using a permitted mobile phone whilst in prison. ""I'm feeling well. I've been fed and I've been watered, so I'm feeling well,"" he stated.Hungarian police records from August identified him as ""Travis Pete Timmerman"" in a missing person's notice, last spotted at a local church. The Missouri State Highway Patrol's bulletin listed him as Pete Timmerman, aged 29, last seen in Budapest, with final contact dated June 2, 2024.US state secretary Antony Blinken said that they are working to bring home Timmerman found. He made this statement in Jordan, where he held meetings to discuss the political transition in Syria.""In terms of (the) American citizen who was found just today, I can't give you any details on exactly what's going to happen, except to say that we're working to bring him home, to bring him out of Syria,"" Blinken told reporters in Aqaba.""But for privacy reasons, I can't share any more details about this,"" Blinken added.The US had no prior indication the man was in Syria, White House spokesperson John Kirby said in a briefing.

How Donald Trump sent his son's 'ex-fiancée' Kimberly Guilfoyle to Greece as Bettina Anderson sparks love triangle gossip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-donald-trump-sent-his-sons-ex-fiance-kimberly-guilfoyle-to-greece-as-bettina-anderson-sparks-love-triangle-gossip/articleshow/116203694.cms,"Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle

US President-elect Donald Trump made a flurry of job announcements on Wednesday, including the selection of Kimberly Guilfoyle as ambassador to Greece . However, the timing of this appointment was anything but ordinary, coming amid a storm of tabloid gossip surrounding his son Donald Trump Jr 's relationship status.Guilfoyle, who had been dating Trump Jr since 2018 and got engaged to him in 2020, found herself in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. The day earlier, British tabloid The Daily Mail published photos of Trump Jr with socialite Bettina Anderson , igniting rumors that he had moved on with a new love interest.The outlet described the images as ""incontrovertible proof"" that Trump Jr had ""moved on"" with the ""stunning 'it girl.'""And so, as his son’s rumored new romance heated up, Donald Trump reportedly sent his son’s 'ex-fiancée' to Greece. The timing of Guilfoyle’s appointment as ambassador could hardly be more dramatic, adding layers to the gossip surrounding the love triangle.Despite the swirling rumors, Guilfoyle’s appointment was met with a glowing endorsement from Trump, who called her ""a close friend and ally"" with “extensive experience and leadership.” However, his Truth Social post made no mention of her relationship with his son, nor did it address the tabloid storm brewing around her and Trump Jr’s alleged breakup.The whispers about the love triangle have been brewing for months.As per the report by NYT, in July, Anderson raised eyebrows at the Republican National Convention , where she sat conspicuously close to Trump Jr and Guilfoyle, clad in a striking red dress. And just last September, reports surfaced of Trump Jr and Anderson sharing a kiss during brunch — adding fuel to the speculation, especially since Anderson was once friends with Trump Jr’s ex-wife, Vanessa Trump.Further intrigue followed when Guilfoyle was notably absent from a postelection family photo, which featured Vanessa, her five children with Trump Jr, and even Elon Musk. The missing fiancée fueled chatter about the couple’s relationship status.Meanwhile, Anderson stirred the pot this week with an Instagram post showcasing a lavish bouquet and a note reading, ""Many have said that you're aging out but I think you're perfect."" Her caption? ""Tough but fair."" Observers were quick to spot Trump Jr's Instagram handle tagged in the post.Anderson, who hails from a prominent Palm Beach family and leads a conservation nonprofit, poked fun at her public image, describing herself online as a “typical stay-at-home mom” who “doesn’t do household chores … or have a husband … or have kids,” reported NYT.When asked about the love triangle rumors , a spokesperson for President-elect Trump dismissed them as “very sexist,” emphasizing that Guilfoyle’s selection was based on her qualifications.Guilfoyle herself shared her excitement about the role, saying she looks forward to “delivering on the Trump agenda, supporting our Greek allies, and ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity.”Trump Jr also chimed in, saying he was “so proud of Kimberly” and confident she would “be an amazing leader.” Whether he’ll join her in Greece remains unanswered, leaving the tabloids to speculate further.For now, all eyes are on Guilfoyle as she steps onto the global stage, carrying both her new diplomatic role and the weight of swirling headlines.","Kimberly Guilfoyle was named ambassador to Greece on Wednesday.

What is the Luigi Mangione '286 Conspiracy Theory'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-luigi-mangione-286-conspiracy-theory/articleshow/116176938.cms,"The Case: The Murder of Brian Thompson



Details of the Crime



Mangione’s Arrest



Key Connections to the Number 286







Timeline of Events



The ""286 conspiracy theory"" centers on the alleged connections between Luigi Mangione—a suspect in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson—and the number 286. Internet sleuths have identified several supposed links between this number and various aspects of Mangione’s life, actions, and the murder, fueling speculation about deeper meanings or intentions.On December 7, 2024, Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was fatally shot outside a Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan. Surveillance footage captured a masked gunman fleeing the scene, described by witnesses as wearing dark clothing and carrying a concealed weapon. The attack occurred at approximately 9:15 PM as Thompson exited a private dinner event. The gunman fired multiple shots, striking Thompson in the chest and abdomen. Despite immediate emergency response, Thompson was pronounced dead upon arrival at a nearby hospital.Thompson was a significant figure in the corporate healthcare industry, known for leading cost-cutting measures and streamlining insurance policies. While these efforts were celebrated by some in the corporate world, they also attracted criticism from activists and patients who felt neglected by the healthcare system.The weapon used in the murder was a ghost gun, an untraceable firearm assembled from unregulated parts. This type of weapon, favored by those seeking to avoid detection, was later discovered among Mangione’s possessions. Witness accounts and surveillance footage showed the suspect fleeing north on foot in a calculated manner, leading authorities to believe the crime was premeditated. Investigators connected Mangione to the murder using ballistic evidence, digital footprints, and his documented animosity toward the corporate healthcare sector.Two days after the murder, on December 9, 2024, Mangione was arrested at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He was found in possession of a ghost gun similar to the one used in the murder, a three-page handwritten manifesto detailing his grievances against corporate America, and forged identification documents. Investigators determined that Mangione had fled Manhattan immediately after the crime, using cash and burner phones to evade capture.The number 286 has emerged as a recurring element in the investigation, with internet sleuths drawing various connections. One notable link is the Pokémon Breloom, which holds the Pokédex number 286. This Pokémon featured prominently in Mangione’s X (formerly Twitter) account banner, leading some to speculate that it was chosen intentionally.Some have tied the number to Proverbs 28:6, a Bible verse stating, “Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity than a rich man who is crooked in his ways.” This verse has been interpreted as reflective of Mangione’s disdain for corporate greed and figures like Thompson. Furthermore, in healthcare billing, denial code 286 refers to claims denied due to failure to meet appeal deadlines—a symbolic connection given Mangione’s documented criticism of the healthcare system.On December 7, 2024, Brian Thompson was fatally shot outside the Hilton hotel in Manhattan. Surveillance footage captured the gunman fleeing the scene. The following day, police identified Mangione as a person of interest based on digital evidence and previous anti-corporate statements. On December 9, Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where he was charged with weapons possession and forgery. Authorities began preparing murder charges based on ballistic evidence and Mangione’s manifesto. On December 10, Mangione appeared in court, and prosecutors revealed his potential motivations and ties to the healthcare industry.The Luigi Mangione ""286 conspiracy theory"" hinges on the idea that a single number ties together various elements of a murder case, reflecting either deliberate symbolism or an unusual string of coincidences. While the significance of 286 remains speculative, the case has captivated public interest, demonstrating how patterns—real or imagined—can influence the narratives of high-profile investigations.","The ""286 conspiracy theory"" centers on the alleged connections between Luigi Mangione and the number 286.

Biden admin unveils historic national strategy to combat Islamophobia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-admin-unveils-historic-national-strategy-to-combat-islamophobia/articleshow/116271514.cms,"US President Joe Biden. (Reuters pic)

The Biden administration on Thursday announced a national strategy to combat Islamophobia and discrimination against Muslim and Arab Americans . The plan outlines over 100 actions across federal agencies and society.This strategy follows a similar plan to address antisemitism released earlier this year. It arrives five weeks before President Biden leaves office and President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated.The White House stated the plan’s importance has grown due to increased threats, citing the October 2023 killing of Wadee Alfayoumi, a 6-year-old Muslim boy, in Illinois.The plan focuses on four areas: Raising awareness of anti-Muslim and anti-Arab hate and recognising these communities’ contributions; improving their safety and security; accommodating their religious practices and reducing discrimination; and building cross-community solidarity against hate.The strategy emphasises the need to recognise that both Muslims and Arabs are targeted for their identities. It highlights new data collection and education efforts to increase awareness of this hate. The plan also calls for wider sharing of effective hate crime reporting practices and clarifies that discrimination against Muslim and Arab Americans in federally funded activities is illegal. It also urges state, local, and international partners, as well as non-governmental groups, to adopt similar initiatives.The Council on American-Islamic Relations criticized the plan, stating: “The White House strategy lays out some positive recommendations related to anti-Muslim bigotry, but it has been released too late to make an impact, fails to promise any changes to federal programs that perpetuate anti-Muslim discrimination on a massive scale.”They added that the plan doesn’t address what they termed a “federal watchlist” or the “US-backed genocide in Gaza.”",The Biden administration announced a national strategy to combat Islamophobia and discrimination against Muslim and Arab Americans.

During his tenure, Alsheikh allegedly directed and participated in inflicting severe physical and psychological trauma on prisoners. He reportedly ordered certain inmates to the ""Punishment Wing,"" where they endured brutal beatings whilst suspended from the ceiling and were subjected to the ""Flying Carpet"" device, which caused severe spinal injuries.Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri stated: ""Samir Alsheikh is charged with torturing political dissidents and other prisoners to deter opposition to the regime of then-Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.""She added: ""Alsheikh later allegedly lied about his crimes to obtain a US green card. The victims of such violent treatment continue to suffer long after the physical acts of torture have ceased.

Peace in the Middle East: A tall order?

Time

President-elect Donald Trump has outlined his ambitious vision to broker peace between Israel and Hamas during his upcoming term, pledging to halt the conflict in the Gaza Strip. However, he has emphasised his distrust in anyone else's ability to achieve this—not even Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.“I don’t trust anybody,” Trump said in amagazine interview after being named “Person of the Year.” His blunt statement reflects his cautious approach toward the Israeli leader and the broader Middle Eastern crisis.When questioned about the possibility of a two-state solution or Israel’s annexation of the West Bank, Trump maintained his focus on ending the bloodshed. “What I want is a deal where there’s going to be peace and where the killing stops,” he remarked.Trump had previously blocked Netanyahu from annexing the West Bank during his first term but left the door open for a different approach, citing the horrific attacks of 7 October 2023, which left over 1,000 people dead. “October 7 was a very terrible day,” he said, underscoring the need for long-lasting peace.Trump’s appointment of former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee as the incoming US ambassador to Israel has raised eyebrows. Huckabee, known for his support of Israeli settlements and openness to annexation, recently told Israel’s Army Radio he would follow the president’s policies regarding such contentious issues.Huckabee also hinted at possible US support for Israeli settlements in Gaza but refrained from making definitive statements, noting, “I don’t want to make any comments about policy because those won’t be mine to make.”Trump expressed confidence in resolving the Israel-Hamas war, claiming it to be a more manageable challenge than the Russia-Ukraine conflict. “The Middle East is going to get solved,” he told, highlighting ongoing productive developments. However, he acknowledged the complexities of creating a peace deal that satisfies all parties involved.Reflecting on his previous term, Trump cited the Abraham Accords as a missed opportunity for broader Middle Eastern cooperation and criticised the lack of subsequent progress.Emphasising his commitment to peace, Trump reiterated his goal of preventing another tragedy like the October 7 massacre. “I want a long-lasting peace, a peace where we don’t have an October 7 in another three years,” he said.","US President-elect Donald Trump has outlined his ambitious vision to broker peace between Israel and Hamas.

FBI did not send undercover agents to join January 6 Capitol attack: Watchdog report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fbi-did-not-send-undercover-agents-to-join-january-6-capitol-attack-watchdog-report/articleshow/116265796.cms,"File photo: FBI director Christopher Wray (Picture credit: AP)

Conspiracy theories and political fallout

The US department of justice inspector general, Michael Horowitz, has released a report discrediting claims that the FBI actively participated in or provoked the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.As per the news agency Reuters, the findings highlight that no undercover FBI agents were present, and none of the bureau's informants were authorised to enter the Capitol or engage in violent acts during the riot.The report counters far-right conspiracy theories suggesting FBI involvement, which have been promoted by supporters of President-elect Donald Trump, including former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.Notably, James Ray Epps, an Arizona man charged with a misdemeanor for entering a restricted area, was falsely accused of being an FBI informant.According to the report, 26 FBI informants were in Washington, D.C., on January 6, most attending protests on their own initiative. Of these, four entered restricted areas, with one entering the Capitol itself, but none acted on FBI instructions.Many informants provided information ahead of the event, though the intelligence was not significantly different from other sources available to the FBI.As per AP, the watchdog noted that the FBI failed to canvass all its field offices for intelligence—a basic step that could have enhanced preparations. Horowitz criticised the bureau's oversight, especially considering the available warnings about potential violence, including a bulletin from the FBI's Norfolk, Virginia, field office a day prior.In response, FBI Director Chris Wray, who plans to step down at the end of President Biden’s term, defended the bureau's actions. He highlighted efforts to disseminate intelligence, including sharing the Norfolk bulletin with Capitol Police and other law enforcement agencies.However, gaps remain evident, such as the FBI's failure to notify Virginia police about reports of a ""quick reaction force"" planning to station weapons nearby.The report also addresses baseless accusations by Republican lawmakers and right-wing figures claiming FBI agents disguised as Trump supporters instigated the violence.FBI Director Wray previously dismissed these allegations as ""ludicrous."" The findings underscore that while the FBI had informants on the ground, their actions were not directed by the bureau.","The US department of justice inspector general, Michael Horowitz, has released a report discrediting claims that the FBI actively participated in or provoked the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.

James Kennedy, a former star of Bravo's Vanderpump Rules, was arrested on Tuesday night in Burbank, California, on charges of misdemeanour domestic violence, reported TMZ.The incident occurred at a private residence where Kennedy and an unnamed woman were reportedly involved in an argument.The Burbank Police Department confirmed that officers were dispatched to the residence at approximately 11.30 pm (local time) after receiving a call about the altercation. A witness allegedly saw Kennedy getting physical with the woman, though law enforcement noted no visible injuries.After investigating, the authorities deemed the incident domestic in nature and arrested Kennedy.The DJ was booked and later released on $20,000 bail. The Burbank City Attorney’s Office is currently reviewing the case for possible charges, as per police sources quoted by TMZ.It is not yet clear who the unnamed woman was but Kennedy and his girlfriend, Ally Lewber, had attended Kathy Hilton’s holiday party earlier that evening.According to a source cited by People, the couple appeared distant throughout the event, and Kennedy reportedly exhibited erratic behaviour. Witnesses at the party claimed he seemed inebriated, acted aggressively, and was ""running back and forth to the bar.""Lewber was seen alone at a public event the following day, smiling for cameras and participating in activities, such as getting a temporary tattoo, hinting at her apparent composure after the incident.Kristen Doute, Kennedy’s former girlfriend and Vanderpump Rules co-star, responded to the news by sharing a screenshot of the TMZ article on her Instagram Stories, captioning it “Finally.”Doute has previously implied abusive behaviour from Kennedy in her 2020 book, ‘He’s Making You Crazy’, though she did not explicitly name him.Kennedy, known for his turbulent personal life and struggles with alcohol, documented his sobriety journey on ‘Vanderpump Rules’. In 2021, he celebrated two years of sobriety but later revealed he was “California sober,” consuming marijuana while abstaining from alcohol.Kennedy’s arrest comes at a time of transition for Vanderpump Rules, which recently announced a complete cast reboot for its upcoming 12th season.While Kennedy is no longer part of the series, his association with the show and its controversies, such as the ""Scandoval"" cheating scandal, has kept him in the public eye.","James Kennedy, a former star of Bravo's Vanderpump Rules, was arrested on Tuesday night in Burbank, California, on charges of misdemeanour domestic violence.

Donald Trump had teased earlier about his son's college choice, describing it as a ""good"" New York-based school, which was later confirmed as NYU.Melania Trump has expressed pride in Barron’s decision to study business in New York, saying it was entirely his choice. “He wants to be in New York, study here, and live at home,” she told Fox News. Melania also reflected on her parenting approach, emphasising that she raised Barron to be independent, allowing him to make his own decisions.Barron’s role during the 2024 presidential election further highlighted his maturity and political awareness. Though he declined to serve as a delegate for Florida at the Republican National Convention, citing prior commitments, he played an influential role behind the scenes.According to Melania, he provided key advice to his father and connected with his generation, significantly impacting Donald Trump’s campaign.Balancing college life and the spotlight hasn’t been easy for Barron. Melania noted, “I don’t think it’s possible for him to have a normal college experience,” but praised his resilience.","Barron Trump, the youngest son of Donald and Melania Trump, has been making waves at New York University’s Stern School of Business since starting his studies in September.

'It's crazy': Trump slams Ukraine's use of US missiles for strikes deep into Russia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/its-crazy-trump-slams-ukraines-use-of-us-missiles-for-strikes-deep-into-russia/articleshow/116264986.cms,"File photo: US President-elect Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

US President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday voiced his strong opposition to Ukraine's use of US-supplied long-range missiles for strikes deep into Russian territory.Speaking to Time magazine in an interview marking his designation as ""Person of the Year,"" Trump called the practice ""crazy,"" suggesting it worsens the ongoing war.""It's crazy what's taking place. It's crazy. I disagree very vehemently with sending missiles hundreds of miles into Russia. Why are we doing that? We're just escalating this war and making it worse,"" he said.These comments follow President Joe Biden's recent decision to lift a US ban on Ukraine deploying long-range missiles like the ATACMS. This move, which Kyiv had been advocating for, was reportedly in response to Russia deploying 15,000 North Korean troops along the battlefront, according to Reuters.While Trump criticised the missile strikes, he assured that he would not abandon Ukraine. ""I want to reach an agreement, and the only way you're going to reach an agreement is not to abandon,"" he emphasised.Trump has repeatedly mentioned his intention to end the nearly three-year-old conflict swiftly but has been vague on specifics, saying his ""very good plan"" would lose value if revealed prematurely.As reported by AFP, Trump reiterated that Washington’s support for Ukraine remains crucial and could serve as leverage to negotiate an end to the war. However, his stance has sparked concerns in Kyiv, where officials worry about the potential terms of any peace deal.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently met Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, where he stressed Ukraine's need for robust security guarantees. Zelensky also highlighted the staggering human toll on both sides, aligning with Trump’s comments on the urgent need to halt the bloodshed.The war continues to escalate, with Russia recently deploying its Oreshnik hypersonic missile as a retaliatory measure to Ukraine's strikes on Russian territory. Meanwhile, the US announced a $988 million arms package for Ukraine last Saturday, further solidifying its support.Asked whether he had contacted Russian President Vladimir Putin since the election, Trump declined to comment, calling it ""inappropriate.""

Bin Laden, Tehran and the Taliban



'Murdered my dreams'



PARACHINAR: Once again, Ali Ghulam receives mourners at his home -- his brother and nephew killed 40 years apart in the same sectarian conflict that was reignited this year in northwest Pakistan, claiming 200 lives since July alone.Thousands of residents are stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district, which borders Afghanistan, as the government struggles to end clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stemming from decades-old tensions over farmland.""Our generations yearn for peace,"" 72-year-old Ghulam told AFP at his home in Parachinar, the main town and a Shiite bastion of the restive district.The latest flare-up of violence has ""reopened wounds"" he said, recalling how his brother was killed in an attack in 1987 that also wounded another three of his brothers.Kurram, known as the ""Parrot's Beak"" for its protrusion into neighbouring Afghanistan, is bounded by dizzyingly high mountains, the northern flank of which includes the Tora Bora caves where Al Qaeda founder and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden once hid.Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for various militant groups, with militants and weapons able to flow largely unchecked in and out of Afghanistan.""I have never experienced peace in my life and have no hope my coming generations will live free of fear,"" Ghulam said.Tribal and family feuds are common in Pakistan.But they can be particularly protracted and violent in the mountainous tribal northwest, where communities live by traditional codes of honour and revenge.The latest round of violence in Kurram erupted in May and intensified in July, when gunmen opened fire on a council of elders attempting to settle the latest round of disagreements over land.Various truces announced since then have held for only weeks or days at a time.More than 300 shops and over 200 homes in Sunni areas have been destroyed, often by fire, and hundreds of families have fled.Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country with Shiites making up 10 to 15 percent of the population, or at least 25 million people.Members of the two sects have periodically clashed in Kurram, where Shiites are particularly vulnerable as they must pass through Sunni-majority neighbourhoods to access essential services.Kurram's location on the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan put it at the heart of the religious and political upheavals of the last five decades.In 1979, Shiites led a revolution in Iran and later that year the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, prompting Sunni hardliners there to rise up against them.Pakistan's military ruler Zia-ul-Haq aligned with them, funnelling thousands of Sunni militants into Afghanistan through Kurram.""It became a hub for arms supply to Afghanistan, including landmines, mortar shells, and weapons of all kinds. Every household in Kurram had a stockpile of weapons,"" Malik Attaullah Khan, a local tribal elder told AFP.Khan, who signed a 2007 agreement aimed at bringing peace to Kurram, criticised the government for failing to ""fulfil in its responsibilities"" in enforcing land settlements.The ethnic Pashtun heartland was merged into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in 2018, but the Pakistani state maintains limited control in the merged districts.In rural areas of Pakistan, villages often bypass the formal justice system and men-only ""jirgas"" or councils made up of respected village elders resolve disputes, sometimes in the form of fines or land reallocation.Ghulam's nephew was killed along with at least 42 others last month, when Sunni gunmen opened fire on a convoy of Shiites being escorted by the police to their homes.In retaliation, a market in a Sunni-dominated area was set on fire.Syed Ghani Shah told AFP his cousin was burned to death inside his shop.""When we buried him, he was so unrecognisable that we couldn't even let his parents see his face,"" Shah said.""Can we ever make peace after all this? Never, if we ever get the chance, we will surely avenge our blood,"" he warned.Authorities have enforced curfews and road closures to reduce the chances of violence breaking out, providing escorts through high-risk areas and using helicopters to deliver supplies.But Akbar Khan, a representative of Pakistan's independent Human Rights Commission told AFP that the state needs to do more to resolve the issue.""In the past, jirgas were successful because they had the full support of the state. Now, the authorities don't even provide the expenses needed to hold a jirga,"" he said.Fatima Ahmed's husband was killed last month while travelling to Islamabad to arrange her admission to medical college.""I don't want to live a life without him. I've lost my will to exist,"" the 21-year-old told AFP.""They haven't just martyred my husband -- they've also murdered my dreams with him,"" she said, bursting into tears.",Violence in northwest Pakistan has killed 200 people since July. Clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stem from decades-old tensions over farmland. Residents stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges, including engaging in political activities and violating a law on official secrets, during field general court martial (FGCM) proceedings against him, military's media affairs wing said Tuesday.Army's media arm ISPR said FGCM also charged Hameed with compromising state security and interests, abusing authority and resources and causing undue harm to individuals. ISPR said proceedings against Hameed were initiated on Aug 12 under provisions of Pakistan Army Act.Hameed, who served as ISI director-general from June 2019 to Oct 2021, was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. He was arrested over accusations about his involvement in land grabbing and snatching valuables and property from the owner of a private housing society. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable in a country where powerful generals have long wielded unparalleled influence in state affairs.""During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (Retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading up to multiple incidents including but not limited to the May 9, 2023 incident for fomenting instability, at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,"" ISPR said. The May 9 incident referred to countrywide protests when PTI supporters stormed army installations and govt buildings following the arrest of party chief and ex-PM Imran Khan for alleged graft. To many, Hameed's close association with Khan was the reason behind his arrest. Khan wanted to continue with Hameed as ISI head but then army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had been adamant on replacing him. Bajwa eventually succeeded and Khan could serve only a few months in office; he was later removed through a no-confidence.Independent observers say action against Hameed could put Khan under pressure and pave the way for the ex-PM to face a military court on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military.","Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges. He was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116191377,imgsize-412913,width-400,resizemode-4/116191377.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries.

Growing threat from Baloch separatists

Sectarian violence fuels instability

Border tensions and counterterrorism efforts

What lies ahead

Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month, according to a report by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). The number of fatalities also surged by 69%, climbing from 100 in October to 169, with 225 others injured.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a banned group, carried out 12 attacks in November, including three high-impact incidents that resulted in 45 deaths. These figures surpassed the fatalities caused by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), indicating a shift in the BLA's operational strategy. Experts suggest this escalation requires a reassessment of counterterrorism tactics.The majority of these attacks in Balochistan targeted security forces and civilians. Notable incidents included an assault on the Quetta railway station, an attack on a police van in Mastung, and a strike on a security check-post in Kalat, which collectively accounted for 91% of the province’s fatalities.Sectarian violence added another layer to the country's security challenges, particularly in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Seven incidents, including two terror attacks and five sectarian clashes, claimed 115 lives and left 137 injured. The violence was triggered by an attack on passenger buses on November 21, which spiraled into broader sectarian unrest.KP remained the most affected province, with 41 terrorist attacks leading to 114 deaths and 95 injuries. The TTP, Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-i-Islam, and other local factions were linked to most of these incidents.The report also highlighted six incidents of border violence along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, resulting in 25 terrorist deaths and 11 injuries. This underscores the ongoing instability in the region and the challenges posed by cross-border insurgents.Security forces conducted 19 counterterrorism operations in November, killing 53 terrorists. Most of these operations were concentrated in KP and Balochistan, the epicenters of recent violence.The PIPS report paints a grim picture of Pakistan's security landscape, with 98 conflict-related incidents causing 338 deaths and 411 injuries in November alone. Experts suggest that the evolving nature of terror threats, including the increasing lethality of BLA operations and persistent sectarian tensions, requires urgent and innovative policy responses.As Pakistan grapples with these challenges, the question remains: can the state adapt quickly enough to address the multifaceted threats destabilizing the country?","Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month.
