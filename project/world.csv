'NRC in disguise': Akhilesh Yadav says BJP deleting votes where it lost; makes big claim against SIR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nrc-in-disguise-akhilesh-yadav-says-bjp-deleting-votes-where-it-lost-makes-big-claim-against-sir/articleshow/125944200.cms,"Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday alleged that the BJP is planning a larger conspiracy of removing voters opposed to BJP, as he claimed the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Uttar Pradesh , calling it ""NRC in disguise.""Addressing reporters in Hyderabad, Yadav accused the BJP and the Election Commission of using SIR as a backdoor method to implement the National Register of Citizens (NRC).""More than three crore votes are at risk of being cut in Uttar Pradesh,"" he claimed.""If such large-scale vote removal happens, and if the BJP and the Election Commission are conspiring to delete votes where the BJP has lost, it amounts to a conspiracy in democracy. This is not the intended purpose of the SIR,"" he added.He further claimed that more than three crore voters in Uttar Pradesh were at risk of being removed from the rolls. “This is not SIR. This is NRC in the guise of SIR. They could not implement NRC directly, so they have brought it in another form,” Yadav saidHe alleged that large-scale deletions were being planned in constituencies where the BJP had lost elections. ""If votes are deleted selectively with the connivance of the Election Commission, it amounts to a conspiracy against democracy,"" the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said.Yadav said the Election Commission should focus on increasing voter participation instead of creating hurdles for voters. Comparing the SIR exercise to demonetisation, the Covid-19 lockdown and the rollout of GST, he said ordinary citizens were once again being inconvenienced.""If NRC is implemented, people are asked to show certain documents.

What happened at Birch by Romeo Lane



Luthra brothers nabbed



Goa police extend custody of accused Bharat Kohli



Fireworks banned in North Goa



NEW DELHI: Deportation proceedings have begun against Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, owners of the Birch By Romeo Lane Club in Goa, with Thai authorities coordinating with Indian law enforcement for their return, officials told ANI.Late on December 6, a devastating fire broke out at the nightclub, claiming 25 lives, including five tourists and 20 staff members.The brothers are currently being held at a detention centre in Bangkok after being moved from Phuket, where they were detained following India’s move to suspend their passports in connection with the fire in Arpora.The Indian Embassy in Bangkok is also actively coordinating with Thai authorities, and sources said the brothers were detained in Phuket following the embassy’s intervention. Thai officials are processing the case under local law, including steps for their deportation to India.They said due process would be followed as cooperation continues between the two countries, with authorities working closely with their Indian counterparts to ensure a prompt and lawful handover, as cited by ANI.Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant reiterated that strict action would be taken against the accused, saying the state government remains committed to securing justice for those who lost their lives in the tragedy.""Our government will work to give justice to the 25 people who lost their lives...We will put them (the club owners, Luthra brothers) behind bars,"" Sawant said on Thursday, as cited by ANI.Twenty-five people, including five tourists, were killed after the fire broke out, while more than 50 others were injured and hospitalised. Officials said most of the victims were staff members working inside the premises.Preliminary findings indicate the blaze was triggered by a cylinder explosion, with three people dying of burn injuries and the rest succumbing to suffocation as thick smoke filled the enclosed space. At least 100 people were on the dance floor when the fire broke out, and in a bid to escape, some ran downstairs to the kitchen area, where they became trapped along with staff, an eyewitness told news agency PTI. Most of the victims were reportedly in the basement area, including three women and several tourists.The brothers were detained by Thai authorities in Phuket earlier this week and are set to be deported to India to face investigation over the deadly fire. Ticket records show the brothers left for Phuket at around 5.30 am on December 7, hours after the fire broke out, while rescue operations were still underway.Goa Police quickly extended the probe internationally, issuing a lookout circular and securing an Interpol blue corner notice on December 9. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) suspended their passports on December 11 and alerted Thai authorities. The brothers’ plea for bail, claiming they had travelled to Thailand “for work,” was rejected by the court.Police told the court the tickets were booked after the fire, contradicting the brothers’ claim they had left on December 6 for business, an act officials called “incriminating.” Thai immigration authorities arrested the brothers on December 11, releasing images showing them in handcuffs at a Phuket resort following requests from Indian agencies.The brothers are also expected to face corporate scrutiny after investigators found that their North Delhi office at 2590, Ground Floor, Hudson Lane, served as the registered address for multiple companies and Limited Liability Partnerships.Goa Police have extended the custody of another accused in the Birch Club fire, Bharat Kohli, by six days for further investigation, officials said. The Mapusa Sessions Court has also issued notices regarding anticipatory bail applications filed by Arpora Panchayat Sarpanch Roshan Redkar and Secretary Raghuvir Bagkar.The court has granted police time until December 16 at 2.30 pm to file a detailed reply and present arguments, according to a press note. So far, over 50 statements have been recorded from individuals connected to the incident, including officials, workers, and victims.In the aftermath of the tragedy, the North Goa district administration on Thursday banned fireworks inside nightclubs, hotels, and other tourist establishments. On Wednesday, BJP’s coalition partner, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), called for the closure of all nightclubs in the state to promote “good tourism.”","Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, owners of the Birch By Romeo Lane Club in Goa, are set to be deported.

GOA: Authorities in Goa are revisiting safety concerns at Romeo Lane, a Vagator nightclub linked to the Luthra brothers, after a tourist’s months-old account of the venue’s unsafe layout resurfaced.Vaibhavi, who visited the club in November, described the nightclub as “suffocating” due to its single elevated entry and exit.She said that staff behaved rudely and that security personnel had physically assaulted her group during the visit.""I visited Romeo Lane in Vagator on 1st November with my cousins. We were 13 people in total. The club is built in such a way that it is very suffocating. It has only one entry and one exit and that too at a height. So it is tough to enter and exit from that club. The staff spoke to us rudely and behaved inappropriately. When we were leaving the club around 3 am, a heavy chair was in our way,"" she said.""My cousin shifted it aside with his foot. The manager came to us and said, 'You are damaging the furniture; we should have thrown you out earlier. You don't have the status to be here.' He grabbed my cousin's collar and started speaking to us rudely.When we tried to apologise and leave, he called all the security personnel, the bouncers. They started chasing us and raised their hands at us. Since it was tough to leave that club, they chased us down and hit people in groups. They hit my sister on the chest, pushed her so badly that she fell down the stairs,"" she added further.""They put up a barricade at the entry gate so we couldn't leave... When my brother removed it, a bouncer ran towards him with a rod and started hitting him badly. When I pushed the bouncer to stop him, he hit me too. They were using such bad language towards us that I had never heard before. Since everyone was badly hurt, we decided to go to the Police station in the morning and not right away. I informed the Police, and they told us to come to the Anjuna Police Station the next day,"" Vaibhavi told news agency ANI.Somehow, an FIR was filed after a lot of effort. I had included the names of both owners in my complaint, but the Police later removed them, saying they were not physically present when this incident occurred, so they are not at fault. f you don't take women's safety and tourist safety seriously, such incidents will keep happening in Goa,"" she added further.Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of the fire-ravaged Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, were recently picked up by Thai police from Hotel Indigo in Patong, Phuket, days after fleeing India on an IndiGo flight as 25 people died in a blaze at their club.The brothers became 'persona non grata' in Thailand after their passports were suspended by the regional passport office in Delhi. Their travel documents were declared invalid after they failed to respond to a notice seeking reasons why action should not be taken against them, easing the execution of India’s request for their detention, officials said.","Goa authorities revisiting safety concerns at Romeo Lane, a Vagator nightclub linked to the Luthra brothers.

Inside The Buzz In Washington

Does it fit Trump's plan?



NEW DELHI: Only a few months back, Donald Trump had said that the US had lost India and Russia to the ""deepest darkest China"". Now, reports indicate he wants the States to join a new grouping with those very countries, and even bring Japan into it. However, no official confirmation has been made regarding this so far.An idea circulating in Washington this week proposed forming a “Core-5” bloc that would include China and Russia, bringing long-time rivals into the same framework and offering a clear contrast to the G7, Politico reported.""Nothing around a C5 or C7 was discussed, but there were certainly conversations that the existing bodies like the G-structures or the UN Security Council weren’t fit for purpose given today’s new players,"" the news outlet quoted a White House official who worked in the previous Trump administration saying.The report suggested the proposal for this group appeared in a longer, unpublished version of the National Security Strategy, referenced by Defense One, though this version couldn’t be independently confirmed by NatSec Daily. The White House firmly rejected the claim, with spokesperson Anna Kelly stating that no alternate, private, or classified version of the 33-page official strategy exists.Though such a plan once seemed unlikely, some observers say it fits Trump’s style.As the US president, he has often sought deals with rival nations, approving the sale of Nvidia’s H200 AI chips to China and sending envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner to Moscow for direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.""This aligns with how we know President Trump to view the world, which is non ideologically, through an affinity for strongmen, and through a propensity of working with other great powers that maintain spheres of influence in their region,"" Politico quoted former director for European affairs on the National Security Council Torrey Taussig saying.The buzz comes at after Trump raised the tariff tensions, especially with the three nations — India, China and Russia, over trade disagreements and Ukraine war.It's not long back when he had posted a picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Chinese President Xi Jinping saying: ""Looks like we’ve lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China. May they have a long and prosperous future together!""The tensions seem to be easing out, but with a deadlock, as India and US are making efforts to finalise a bilateral trade deal.Moreover, PM Modi had a telephonic conversation with Trump on Thursday and the two reviewed ""bilateral relations and discussed regional and international developments.""""Had very warm and engaging conversation with President Trump. We reviewed progress in our bilateral relations and discussed regional and international developments. India and the US will continue to work together for global peace, stability and prosperity,"" PM Modi posted on X.","An idea circulating in Washington this week proposed forming a “Core-5’ bloc that would include China and Russia.

Karur Stampede Tragedy: TVK blames DMK For Conspiracy As 40 Die, Nearly 100 Left Injured

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday observed, ""there is something wrong going on in the high court,"" as it rejected the Tamil Nadu government’s plea to modify its earlier order suspending a one-man inquiry commission and the SIT probe into the Karur stampede, which claimed 41 lives. The bench of Justices JK Maheswari and Vijay Bishnoi emphasised, ""We want everything to be fair and impartial.""During the hearing, senior advocate P Wilson, representing the government, said that the state commission would not interfere with the CBI investigation and would only make recommendations to prevent such incidents. The bench then asked Wilson to read the notification appointing the commission and reiterated, ""We want everything to be fair and impartial.""The court reviewed a report filed by the registrar general of the Madras High Court , which highlighted how a writ petition seeking SOPs for rallies was registered as a criminal writ petition. ""There is something wrong going on in the high court. This is not a right thing that is happening in the high court,"" said the bench.Wilson and senior advocate Siddharth Luthra requested a copy of the report, stating they wished to file a reply.The Karur stampede occurred on September 27 during a rally of actor-politician Vijay’s Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK).Police had earlier stated that the rally saw a turnout of 27,000 people, nearly three times the expected 10,000, and attributed the tragedy to a seven-hour delay by Vijay in reaching the venue.On October 13, the Supreme Court had ordered a CBI investigation into the incident, noting that the tragedy ""has shaken the national conscience and deserves a fair and impartial investigation."" In the same order, the court had suspended the state’s directions for appointing a SIT and a one-man inquiry commission and set up a three-member supervisory committee, headed by former apex court judge Ajay Rastogi, to monitor the CBI probe.The top court had also criticised Justice N Senthilkumar of the Madras High Court for entertaining petitions related to the incident, ordering an SIT probe, and making observations against TVK and its members without making them parties to the case.Earlier, on October 30, the court had advised a victim’s family to approach the CBI with allegations that they had been threatened by officials, stating, ""Except to say the same, at present, no further orders are required to be passed on the interlocutory applications.""Noting the political undertone of the case, the court said that comments made to the media by top police officers, ""without having regard to the gravity of the incident,"" could create doubts about impartiality and the fairness of the investigation.","Justices JK Maheswari and Vijay Bishnoi emphasised, ""We want everything to be fair and impartial"" The Karur stampede occurred on September 27 during a rally of actor-politician Vijay’s Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125932868,imgsize-921122,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-1.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Karnataka Congress MLA Iqbal Hussain on Friday claimed that deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar will become chief minister after the ongoing winter session of the state legislature, adding fuel to speculation over a possible leadership change within the ruling party.Speaking to reporters, the Ramanagara MLA confirmed that he attended a late-night dinner with Shivakumar and several ministers and legislators. He dismissed suggestions that the meeting was a show of strength. ""MLAs from various constituencies have come for the session; it is a rare opportunity for all of us to meet. During the session, we meet each other. We had dinner together. What's there in that? Can having food together be called a show of strength?"" he said.Asked whether Shivakumar shared any political developments during the gathering, Hussain responded, ""I'm giving the good news. He will become (CM) after the session, he will become. What's wrong with it?"" He added, ""....Shivakumar will get a chance, he will become the chief minister now.""Hussain said 50 to 55 Congress legislators attended the dinner. While party leaders described it as a casual meeting, it took place amid heightened speculation over a power tussle between Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar, particularly after the government crossed the halfway mark of its five-year term on November 20.Reacting to remarks that Shivakumar's elevation would depend on destiny, Hussain said, ""Everything will happen if the god has written in one's fate.... We are all confident that Shivakumar has a chance for his efforts, struggle, and organising the party. We have told the same to the high command, the high command will decide.""The MLA reiterated that the Congress remains disciplined and that the final decision on the chief ministership rests with the central leadership. ""Numbers are not important here. We should be committed to the decision they make. They have said that everyone should abide by the party discipline and abide by their decision. This is the party culture, too. We will abide by their decision,"" he said.The Congress high command has recently attempted to contain the leadership friction, with both Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar holding breakfast meetings at each other's residences. The gesture was seen as a signal that Siddaramaiah would continue as chief minister for now, particularly with the Belagavi legislature session underway. The session, which began on December 8, will continue until December 19.Deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar and over 30 Congress legislators, including some ministers, met for a dinner late on Thursday night, party sources told PTI.Ministers K H Muniyappa, Mankal Vaidya, Dr M C Sudhakar, MLAs N A Haris, Ramesh Bandisiddegowda, H C Balakrishna, Ganesh Hukkeri, Darshan Dhruvanarayana, Ashok Kumar Rai, K Y Nanjegowda were among those present in the meeting, the sources added.Expelled BJP MLAs ST Somashekhar and Shivaram Hebbar also attended the dinner, they said.The dinner meeting came a day after CM Siddaramaiah, along with ministers and a few legislators considered close to him, met for a dinner hosted by former Belagavi North MLA Feroz Sait.Though leaders term it a casual dinner meeting, speculation is rife as it had taken place amid a power tussle in the ruling party, over the CM post.There were speculations about a change in chief minister when the Congress government reached the halfway mark of its five-year term on November 20, as it was believed that there was a powersharing agreement between Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar after the grand old party won the Assembly election in 2023.As the government crossed this crucial date, activities intensified in Congress, and both the CM and the Deputy CM met over breakfast at each other's residences, on the instructions of the high command. This was seen as a move to pause the leadership tussle between the two and to signal Siddaramaiah's continuation as the CM for the time being, especially ahead of the Belagavi legislature session.","Deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar and over 30 Congress legislators, including some ministers, met for a dinner late on Thursday night, party sources told PTI.

‘Anti-Sanatan’: Anurag Thakur attacks Tamil Nadu govt over Karthigai Deepam controversy; asks 'why are Hindus lathi charged'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/anti-sanatan-anurag-thakur-attacks-tamil-nadu-govt-over-karthigai-deepam-controversy-asks-why-are-hindus-lathi-charged/articleshow/125930243.cms,"'Hindus Are Lathi-Charged': Anurag Thakur Attacks Tamil Nadu Govt Over Karthigai Deepam Row

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Anurag Thakur on Friday criticised the Tamil Nadu government over the Karthigai Deepam dispute, alleging that it has adopted what he called an ""anti Sanatan"" stance.Raising the issue in the Lok Sabha, the BJP MP said, ""I want to raise a very important issue where one state in India has become a symbol of anti-Sanatan Dharma. Their ministers are making statements against Sanatan Dharma. "" He added that devotees had been compelled to seek judicial intervention to access the temple.Thakur referred to the Madurai bench of the Madras high court, which recently pulled up the state government, accusing officials of ignoring its order on lighting the Karthigai Deepam lamp at Madurai's Thiruparankundram temple. He said, ""People were forced to approach the court to reach the temple. The Madurai bench of the Madras High Court came down strongly on the Tamil Nadu government, accusing officials of deliberately ignoring its order on lighting the Karthigai Deepam lamp at Madurai's Thiruparankundram temple. ""The minister further alleged that devotees faced police action during the episode. ""Hindus are lathi-charged... Why are Hindus stopped?..."" he asked, pressing the government over the treatment of worshippers at the temple.The Karthigai Deepam row escalated sharply lastweek as the Tamil Nadu government again declined to comply with a Madras High Court order permitting the lighting of the ceremonial lamp at the Deepathoon stone pillar atop Thiruparankundram hills. This marked the second consecutive day of defiance, even as a division bench rejected the state’s appeal against contempt proceedings initiated for non-compliance.Tensions rose on the ground, with BJP state chief Nainar Nagendran and several party workers detained in Madurai during protests against the state government. Over 1,000 police personnel were deployed as security forces stopped petitioners and supporters from reaching the hilltop despite the court’s direction.Earlier, a bench of Justices G Jayachandran and K K Ramakrishnan dismissed the state government’s appeal, calling it an attempt to pre-empt contempt action. The bench upheld single-judge Justice G R Swaminathan’s order allowing petitioners to light the lamp at Deepathoon under CISF protection. The single bench had initiated contempt proceedings after officials facilitated lighting the lamp at Uchi Pillaiyar Temple instead of at Deepathoon as directed on December 1.Following the dismissal of the appeal, Justice Swaminathan resumed contempt hearings, set aside the prohibitory orders issued by the Madurai district administration, and again permitted the lighting of the lamp at the hilltop, this time under the protection of Madurai city police. The judge warned that if officials continued to ignore the order, “harsh consequences will ensue.” Officials again blocked access, citing public order concerns.Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu government approached the Supreme Court seeking an urgent hearing on its appeal against the High Court’s orders. When mentioned before a bench led by Chief Justice Surya Kant, the court declined to provide an immediate listing, saying it would consider the request as soon as possible. The state argued that it had exclusive authority over temple rituals and customs under the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act of 1959, and said the High Court could not use contempt jurisdiction to intervene in matters of religious practice.Appearing for a caveator, advocate P V Yogeswaran criticised the state’s approach. He said the government was “repeatedly defying the HC’s orders” and “creating a drama” by filing an appeal to stall contempt proceedings. The High Court has maintained that its directions do not affect the rights of the adjacent dargah and has upheld the petitioners’ right to perform the ritual at the designated Deepathoon site.The state’s appeal in the Supreme Court describes the issue as raising broader questions about the limits of contempt jurisdiction, the autonomy of temple management, and the interplay between judicial orders and executive enforcement powers. It pointed to the district administration’s prohibitory orders issued around 6pm on December 3, at the same time Justice Swaminathan had directed that the petitioner be allowed access to the hilltop. The High Court division bench earlier observed that executive orders under Section 162 of the BNSS cannot override judicial directions and described the timing of the prohibitory orders as indicative of a “well-designed act” to avoid compliance.The division bench will hear related appeals from the Madurai district collector and temple authorities on December 5. Justice Swaminathan had earlier permitted petitioners, including Rama Ravikumar, to light the lamp at Deepathoon after dismissing the state government’s objections about the site’s proximity to a dargah and claims that the ritual had long been conducted at Uchi Pillaiyar Temple.","BJP MP Anurag Thakur criticises Tamil Nadu government over the Karthigai Deepam dispute.

56 ex-judges throw weight behind Madras HC judge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/56-ex-judges-throw-weight-behind-madras-hc-judge/articleshow/125942478.cms,"Say Impeachment Move A Brazen Attempt To 'Browbeat Judiciary'

NEW DELHI: Expressing solidarity with Madras high court judge Justice G R Swaminathan, 56 former judges Friday issued an open letter urging members of Parliament to withdraw the impeachment notice against him. They warned that the move undermines judicial independence and seeks to pressure judges who do not align with certain political or ideological expectations.Signatories include former SC judges Adarsh Goel and Hemant Gupta, Justice Anil Deo Singh (ex-CJ Rajasthan HC), Justice Narsimha Reddy (ex-CJ Patna HC), Justice P B Bajanthri (ex-CJ Patna HC) and Justice Subhro Kamal Mukherjee (ex-CJ Karnataka HC).The notice was filed after Justice Swaminathan, acting on a petition by a right-wing activist, directed state authorities to ensure that a sacred lamp be lit at a hilltop temple. Govt officials said this went against the longstanding practice of lighting the lamp at the nearby Deepa Mandapam, where the ritual had been observed for years.In their letter, the former judges sharply criticised the attempt to remove him. ""We, the former Judges of SC and former CJs and Judges of HCs, take serious exception to the attempt being made by certain MPs and other senior advocates to impeach Justice G R Swaminathan of Madras HC.This is a brazen attempt to browbeat judges who do not fall in line with the ideological and political expectations of a particular section of society. If such an attempt is permitted to proceed, it would cut at the very roots of our democracy and independence of judiciary.""They stressed that the reasons cited by the MPs do not justify such a drastic step. ""Even if the reasons mentioned by the signatory MPs are taken at face value, they are wholly inadequate to justify resorting to such a rare, exceptional & serious constitutional measure as impeachment,"" the statement said.The former judges further warned that using impeachment to challenge judicial decisions poses a grave threat to the rule of law.""The very purpose of the impeachment mechanism is to uphold the integrity of the judiciary, not to convert it into a tool of arm-twisting, signalling and retaliation. To wield the threat of removal as a means of compelling judges to conform to political expectations is to turn a constitutional safeguard into an instrument of intimidation.Such an approach is ""anti-democratic, anti-constitutional, and an anathema"" to the rule of law. The present attempt to impeach a sitting high court judge for discharging his judicial duty is, therefore, not an isolated episode but part of a continuing assault on dignity and independence of the judicial institution itself. Today, the target may be one judge; tomorrow, it will be the institution as a whole,"" they said.They also noted that this reflects a wider pattern of pressure on the judiciary. According to them, recent years have seen similar attempts to attack or discredit former chief justices Dipak Misra, Ranjan Gogoi, S A Bobde and D Y Chandrachud, as well as current CJI Justice Surya Kant, whenever their decisions upset political groups.

SC rejects TN's plea for state commission to probe stampede

The apex court said it would examine the report filed by the HC's registrar general.It, however, turned down the Tamil Nadu govt's plea to allow its commission of inquiry into the cause of the incident in which 41 people died.A bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and Vijay Bishnoi directed that the HC report be shared with the counsels for the parties and called for their response.The apex court had earlier also raised the question of how the HC's principal bench in Chennai could have directed the formation of an SIT, when Karur fell within the jurisdiction of the Madurai bench.""Something wrong is going in the HC.

'A Nation That Never Bows to Terror, Operation Sindoor Shows New India’s Resolve, Says PM Modi

Barbaric actions can't be excused, says SC

NEW DELHI: Carving out an exception to 'bail not jail' principle, Supreme Court has ruled that the right of an accused person to life and liberty should be protected, but it cannot be the sole ground to grant him bail when he is facing trial in a UAPA case for endangering national security and integrity.Dealing with CBI's challenge to bail granted by Calcutta HC to the accused who removed railway tracks, leading to derailment of Jnaneshwari Express and collision with a goods train resulting in the death of 148 people and injuries to 170 on June 9, 2010, a bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and N K Singh said ""individual liberty is not absolute and is subject to just exceptions, that is, the paramount considerations of national interest, sovereignty and integrity of the nation. ""The scales of Lady Justice must balance on the one hand the constitutionally consecrated and jealously guarded right under Article 21""and the just exceptions, it said.Writing the judgment, Justice Karol said, ""Certain cases such as the instant one demand, by their very nature and effect, that the issue presented is looked at from a much wider point of view - national security.""The derailment was caused by Maoist cadres to pressurise govt to withdraw deployment of a joint force of state police and central paramilitary force in Jhargram to combat and capture Rasua village by the Maoists.Apart from loss of lives and injuries to persons, the govt lost approximately Rs 25 crore in the damage caused to public property.The bench said every citizen, irrespective of the grouping or section in society, has a constitutional right to protest within the limits of law against govt's policy decisions. But barbaric actions, like the sabotage on train tracks resulting in deaths of nearly 150 unsuspecting citizens undertaking a train journey, cannot be excused, it said.Also read: Supreme Court asks government to consider bringing back Sunali’s husband, 3 others from Bangladesh It also rejected the argument that since the accused have undergone more than 12 years of imprisonment, they are entitled to bail under provision 436A of IPC, which mandates release of an undertrial accused on bail once he served more than half the maximum sentence for the offence. SC said for terror acts like the one in hand, one of the possible punishments is death, and hence 12-year incarceration cannot be a ground for release on bail under 436A.The bench noted the reverse burden cast under UAPA on accused to prove their innocence and said the trial courts must ensure that the persons incarcerated in such offences are given every document cited against them to prepare their defence and give them a chance to prove their innocence. It ordered an expeditious trial in the more than 15-year-old case.","The Supreme Court has ruled that individual liberty, while crucial, cannot override national security concerns in UAPA cases.

Supreme Court Directs Dogs Be Shifted From Schools, Bus Stands To Shelters; Petitioner Breaks Down

SRINAGAR: Political parties and teachers’ unions in Jammu & Kashmir have slammed education department’s recent directives mandating teachers to report stray dog populations and take part in “management of stray dogs”, and demanded their immediate withdrawal and strict action against officials responsible for issuing such orders. A senior education department official, however, said the orders were based on Supreme Court’s recent guidelines on stray dogs.Jammu & Kashmir Civil Society Forum president Abdul Qayoom Wani described the orders as “shocking” and said they hurt the dignity of thousands of teachers across the Union Territory. Wani, a former head of Jammu & Kashmir Teachers’ Forum, said administration was assigning teachers such duties that had “no connection with teaching or academic development”.PDP called the directives “atrocious”, saying teachers were meant to teach and should not be forced to perform tasks outside their professional role. “Govt must respect educators, not humiliate them with irrational directives,” PDP spokesperson Syed Tajamul said.Jammu & Kashmir General Line Teachers Forum said in a statement the orders were “insulting, irrelevant and an affront to the dignity of teachers”.In the past three days, orders have been issued by various chief education officers across the Union Territory to all drawing and disbursing officers and heads of institutions of govt and private schools to nominate one nodal officer for “monitoring and coordination regarding stray dogs in and around the premises”.According to the orders, the nodal officer will be responsible for reporting sightings and incidents related to stray dogs. The officer will coordinate with municipal, animal husbandry and local bodies concerned for “effective removal and management of stray dogs around educational premises”. The nodal officer will also ensure safety and awareness among staff and students.Jammu & Kashmir has reported more than 2.1 lakh dog-bite cases since 2022, with Jammu and Srinagar districts recording the highest average daily bites at 24.9 and 37.6, respectively.","Jammu & Kashmir has reported more than 2.1 lakh dog-bite cases since 2022.

PATNA: About a month after she broke off relations with her family, RJD chief Lalu Prasad's daughter, Rohini Acharya, signalled there was further strain when she appealed to Bihar's govt to ensure that every woman can stay safely in her parental home. Rohini, who lives in Singapore, had donated her kidney to her father Lalu in Dec 2022 for transplant at a Singapore hospital.In a social media post on Thursday, she indirectly praised chief minister Nitish Kumar for distributing Rs 10,000 among women and giving cycles to schoolgirls, but said these steps were inadequate.

Why will we run away from own country: Sunali

NEW DELHI: More than nine months pregnant now, and visibly exhausted, Sunali Khatun's voice carried a strange mix of tired resolve and simmering anger when she spoke to TOI on Thursday. ""I'm tired from inside. The worst part is that despite showing all documents, no one listened to us,"" she said, fighting back tears.The 26-year-old domestic worker from Paikar village in West Bengal's Birbhum district was detained during an identity verification drive in Delhi's Rohini in late June this year. Sunali said she and her husband, Danish Sekh, immediately produced every document they had - Aadhaar, PAN and ration card. ""I even quickly presented my in-laws' ID proofs arranged over WhatsApp the same night."" Nothing worked.We did everything in our power,"" Sunali said. ""We showed every single document. We kept telling them, 'We are not Bangladeshi. We are Indian.' Who will listen to people like us?""Within 48 hours, on June 26, after the Foreigners Regional Registration Office deportation order, police seized the couple's belongings from their Rohini jhuggi and took them and their eight-year-old son, Sabir Sekh, to Guwahati.From there, she said, they were pushed across the Bangladesh border in hot haste.The deportation was sudden and unexpected for the couple and their families back in West Bengal. For the next five months, Sunali was trapped in a maze of suspicion. What followed, she says, ""broke something inside her.""After filing a missing-person complaint at his local Palkar police station on 6 July 2025, Sunali's father, Bhodu Sekh, moved the Calcutta HC three days later. On 9 July 2025, his habeas corpus petition seeking production of his daughter, son-in-law and grandson was registered.With no information from authorities & fearing his heavily pregnant daughter might be left to deliver without medical help in an unknown country, Bhodu filed pleading for urgent intervention. In his petition, he, too, said family had supplied Aadhaar, voter IDs, PAN cards and land records to show their Indian roots, yet authorities deported them.Back in Bangladesh, the time there for Sunali and her family were a blur of hunger, fear and humiliation.

22 Feared Dead As Truck Falls Into Gorge In Arunachal Pradesh

GUWAHATI: A possibly lone survivor among 22 people on board a truck that plunged into a gorge in a remote location of Arunachal Pradesh Monday night clambered out of the wreckage, climbed 200m and trudged nearly 4km to reach a BRO camp late Wednesday to report the tragedy almost 48 hours later.The victims - 19 bodies had been retrieved until Thursday evening - were all labourers from Assam being ferried to a site in Anjaw district, bordering China, when the accident occurred along Hayuliang-Chaglagam Road. Army teams continue to search for the other two workers.It wasn't immediately clear if the critically injured survivor included the truck driver among the 22 that he said were involved in the crash, officials said. He has been shifted to Assam Medical College and Hospital in Dibrugarh, around 260km from Hayuliang.Nang Chingni Choupoo, in charge of the Anjaw district disaster management department, told TOI that Army teams used ropes to descend into the deep gorge and trace the wreckage. The 19 bodies found so far are still to be brought up.""Since the Army personnel do not have specialised equipment to carry the bodies, an NDRF team from Dibrugarh is being sent there with the required equipment.The operation will resume Friday morning,"" Choupoo said. ""For now, we are assuming there were 22 people, unless the driver wasn't counted. The mangled truck lies upside down and rescuers need to cut through the metal to determine if anyone is trapped inside.""The Assam govt has deputed a joint team of the Tinsukia civil and police administration to travel to the area and coordinate with Army and Arunachal Pradesh officials. The nearest camp, which the injured survivor reached, belongs to the General Reserve Engineer Force under which BRO operates.Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said both states were working closely to rescue survivors, if any, and get the victims' bodies home.Defence PRO Lt Col M Rawat said multiple search and rescue columns of the Army, medical teams, GREF representatives, local police and NDRF personnel worked for hours to locate the wreckage and the bodies.Initial reports suggested the workers were from Tinsukia and travelling to Chaglagam for work.

Why the Sherrone Moore firing created the perfect storm for the Paige Shiver pregnancy rumor

What is confirmed about Paige Shiver and why her name is repeating in every Sherrone Moore conversation

Is Paige Shiver pregnant is the question sitting at the top of every search bar now that the Sherrone Moore story has turned into a full public meltdown. Michigan fired Sherrone Moore for cause, police detained him hours later, and the university confirmed only one concrete detail. There was an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. The school did not name the staffer. Law enforcement did not name the staffer. Yet Paige Shiver has been pushed into the center of the scandal by social media detectives who filled in the gaps with their own theories.The rumor grew even louder once Shiver deleted or hid her social media accounts. That timing alone was enough for people to assume something explosive had happened. None of the pregnancy claims have been confirmed by the university, law enforcement, or any official source. They remain unverified speculation attached to a real firing and a real police detention.Michigan cut Sherrone Moore with immediate effect after internal investigators said they found credible evidence of an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. Athletic director Warde Manuel’s statement was clear and direct.“U M head football coach Sherrone Moore has been terminated, with cause, effective immediately. Following a university investigation, credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. This conduct constitutes a clear violation of university policy, and U M maintains zero tolerance for such behavior,” he said.That was the official foundation. Everything after that came from outside the university.A few hours after his termination, officers in Saline, Michigan detained Sherrone Moore during a domestic incident at an apartment. The Pittsfield Township Police Department took over the investigation. ESPN’s Dan Wetzel reported the development on X, stating that authorities located and detained Moore for potential charges. Police have said the incident was not random. Reports from Michigan have also noted that Moore threatened to harm himself during the encounter. The investigation is ongoing and the exact charges remain unknown.The timing, the firing for cause, the police involvement, and the sudden vacuum around the unnamed staffer created an open space online. Users decided to choose their own protagonist. That is how the theory about Paige Shiver began.Shiver joined Michigan in 2022 in on campus recruiting and operations. She became the executive assistant to the head coach in 2024. That role places her physically and professionally close to the head coach at all times. Combine that proximity with the fact that the university did not release a name and you have a recipe for internet assignment.The rumor escalated when users noticed that she set her Instagram to private and deactivated her LinkedIn and X accounts. Marca reported that her Facebook page now shows only her profile and cover image. People interpreted the move as confirmation. In reality, any employee who becomes the target of unverified allegations often shuts down digital profiles to avoid harassment.The pregnancy claim grew out of posts from large commentary accounts on X that have no official sourcing. These accounts circulated messages, screenshots, and unverified claims that spread quickly. None of the claims about pregnancy appear in any official document, press release, police report, or university statement. They remain social media theories with no confirmation.Meanwhile, everything officially tied to the firing stays the same. The university confirmed an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. The staff member has not been identified. The rumor that the staff member is Paige Shiver and that she is pregnant is not supported by any confirmed evidence.Away from the sidelines and the pressure of Michigan football, Moore is simply a father of three. He and his wife, Kelli, share daughters Shiloh, Solei, and Sadie, who have long been described by people around the family as the center of his world. Moore rarely speaks publicly about them, but he has often hinted that they are the foundation of his life outside coaching.Social media has turned the Moore scandal into a frenzy, and one of the loudest claims is that Paige Shiver and Kelli Moore may have known each other beyond the workplace. Nothing has been confirmed, but the idea of his alleged mistress being friendly with his wife is adding a sharper edge to already wild pregnancy rumors and online speculation.The confirmed information about her is simple and factual. According to Larry Brown Sports and the Michigan athletics website, Shiver joined the Wolverines in 2022 and moved into the executive assistant position in 2024. She has worked in operations, recruitment support, and administrative planning. She is the daughter of longtime Chicago Bears scout Jeff Shiver. She is also a Purdue graduate who was profiled by the Bears in 2016 for her experience living with Pompe Disease.None of these details link her directly to the inappropriate relationship that resulted in Moore’s firing. None link her to the police detention. None confirm any pregnancy rumor.What is not confirmed is whether the staff member involved is Paige Shiver. What is not confirmed is whether she was pregnant. None of this appears in official records. None of it has been acknowledged by the university or the police.Per AP, Sherrone Moore is set to be arraigned Thursday afternoon, barely a day after he was fired for what the university called an inappropriate relationship with a staff member and later arrested just south of Michigan Stadium. Court records show he is still in the custody of the Washtenaw County Jail, which has not released details about the reason for his detention or his bond status.Sherrone Moore’s firing has now pulled in a second wave of controversy after OnlyFans creator Mia Sorety claimed the former Michigan coach sent her flirty DMs while married. Her allegations surfaced as unverified online rumors continued to link staffer Paige Shiver to Moore’s misconduct case, adding to the scrutiny around his online behavior and personal life, though none of these claims have been officially confirmed.Moore remains in custody in Washtenaw County as he awaits an expected arraignment Friday, though no charges have been filed so far. Police have confirmed they are investigating an alleged incident tied to his detention, but court officials say paperwork has not yet been submitted, leaving the case in limbo as the fallout from his firing continues.","Paige Shiver has been pulled into the Sherrone Moore scandal amid unverified pregnancy rumors.

Daniel 'Booby' Gibson in jail?

Daniel 'Booby' Gibson explains traffic stop mix-up as warrant from past speeding case leads to his arrest

Daniel ‘Booby’ Gibson explains his arrest and clears up the traffic stop report.

Daniel ""Boobie"" Gibson, a former Cleveland Cavaliers player, was taken into custody after a traffic stop on Monday night. Around 10:30 p.m., Gibson was stopped by Beachwood police for operating a pickup truck without tail lights. When the officer checked his license, they found a warrant related to an earlier speeding. He was then arrested.He then requested the police to give him some leeway after all that he had done for the community. The former guard for the Cleveland Cavaliers believed that his fame would support him during a trying time. Nevertheless, his attempts failed.Gibson was pulled up on December 8, 2022, for violating the 70 mph speed limit by 90 mph. After recognizing him, the officer was involved in a conversation with him. But things got worse when a regular license check revealed that he had a warrant related to an earlier speeding infraction.He brought up his community service hours with the police. However, he realized that nothing he said would stop the process. After voicing his displeasure and asking for the officer's name and badge number, he got out of the vehicle to be taken into custody.Gibson informed the officer that he believed the lights were on, according to the police report. Nevertheless, the officer demonstrated Gibson how to turn them on after opening the driver's door and noticing that the switch was in the off position. Gibson claimed that because the car's settings were not familiar to him, he had been driving without his taillights on.He was even informed by the officer that he would not be issued a ticket. The officer was informed that Gibson's California driver's license was valid when he called it in to dispatch. However, he had an active warrant from Mansfield Municipal Court. The Ohio State Highway Patrol (OSHP) issued the warrant for failure to appear in court about a speeding ticket in 2023.OSHP acknowledged the warrant and promised to extradite him when Beachwood police got in touch with them. Gibson was later taken into custody on the warrant. An OSHP trooper was dispatched to get Gibson after he was taken to the Beachwood Jail.Gibson paid the $215 fee when he appeared in Mansfield Municipal Court on Tuesday. With a valid driver's license, the passenger in Gibson's pickup truck was free to depart. The warrant was still in effect because he skipped the court date and the fine had never been paid.Gibson said during the arrest:“Every time I’ve ever been arrested out here, or pulled over, every officer has allowed me to go home and handle the stuff from home.”He also talked about how he had spent time with the mayor earlier that evening, and he was disappointed that his local work was irrelevant in this case. He later released a statement discussing the situation. He said:“Just to clear the air — the recent report made my traffic stop sound bigger than it was. I was pulled over for my kit lights, not a speeding arrest.”He then clarified that he lost track of the ticket since he was travelling between Houston and Cleveland. He continued by saying that he had already turned his attention to aiding the 400 kids impacted by a recent Project fire and that he intended to stay in Cleveland full-time in order to support the neighborhood. Nevertheless, even though he was arrested for a while, he is now a free man.Also read: What did Shawn Kemp do?

"Epstein cache surfaces: House panel unveils 19 fresh photos; Trump, Clinton, Bill Gates appear in new images",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/epstein-cache-surfaces-house-panel-unveils-19-fresh-photos-trump-clinton-bill-gates-appear-in-new-images/articleshow/125937405.cms,"Princess Sofia’s Epstein Encounters Exposed; The ‘Scandal Queen’ Files Just Got Darker





NEW DELHI: House Oversight Committee Democrats on Friday released a set of photographs obtained from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, revealing images of several high-profile figures who had interacted with the disgraced financier over the years, including President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Steve Bannon, Bill Gates, Richard Branson and others.The photos, 19 in total, were part of a larger cache of more than 95,000 images the estate turned over to congressional investigators. While many of the individuals shown had previously been linked to Epstein, the newly released images offered additional glimpses into their associations. None of the photographs depicted sexual misconduct or involved underage girls, and it remained unclear when or where they were taken.Among the images was a bowl of novelty condoms featuring a caricature of Trump labelled “Trump condom 4.50,” with each packet printed with the phrase “I’m HUUUUGE!” Another showed Trump with a group of women whose faces were redacted. Additional photos included Epstein and Steve Bannon posing in a mirror, Bill Clinton alongside Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, Bill Gates with the former Prince Andrew, and images of former Harvard President Larry Summers and attorney Alan Dershowitz.The Republican-led committee had obtained the images as part of its ongoing probe into Epstein’s network and influence. Lawyers for the estate told the panel in a letter that the materials spanned photos and videos taken at any property owned or used by Epstein between 1990 and 2019. They added that only minimal redactions had been applied for nudity. Democrats said the production included “over 95,000 photos, including images of the wealthy and powerful men who spent time with Jeffrey Epstein” as well as thousands of images of women and Epstein properties.Rep Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the committee, said, “It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends. These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world. We will not rest until the American people get the truth. The Department of Justice must release all the files, NOW. ”Republicans pushed back, accusing Democrats of selectively releasing images to create a misleading narrative about Trump. A committee spokesperson said, “We received over 95,000 photos and Democrats released just a handful. Democrats’ hoax against President Trump has been completely debunked. Nothing in the documents we have received shows any wrongdoing. It is shameful Rep Garcia and Democrats continue to put politics above justice for the survivors. ”CNN has reached out to representatives for Trump, Clinton, Bannon, Gates, Summers, Dershowitz, Richard Branson and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing related to Epstein, and his spokesperson has said he severed ties well before Epstein’s 2019 arrest. Gates’ representatives have also repeatedly denied that Epstein ever worked for him, and Gates has previously called his interactions with Epstein “a huge mistake. ”Trump and his aides have portrayed the renewed focus on his past connection to Epstein as politically motivated. In earlier emails released by the committee, Epstein claimed that Trump “spent hours” with accuser Virginia Giuffre and “knew about the girls,” assertions Trump has dismissed as false, with White House officials calling the claims a “hoax.”The fallout from associations with Epstein has extended far beyond politics. Larry Summers stepped back from teaching at Harvard and left the OpenAI board, saying he was “deeply ashamed” of maintaining ties with Epstein. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor relinquished the use of his royal titles after public scrutiny intensified, though he has denied misconduct allegations.The latest disclosures add to the growing trove of documents, emails and images shaping the committee’s widening inquiry into the late financier’s network of influence, which continues to cast a shadow over figures across politics, academia, technology and global business.","House Oversight Committee Democrats released a set of photographs obtained from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate.

NEW DELHI: Russian president Vladimir Putin on Friday kept Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif waiting for more than 40 minutes before the Pakistani leader ""gatecrashed"" into an ongoing meeting between Putin and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkmenistan, according to RT.As per RT correspondent, ""PM Sharif waited for over 40 minutes for President Putin before growing tired and gate-crashing Russian leader's meeting with Erdogan.

Former Michigan head coach Sherrone Moore is facing a series of serious legal charges after being arrested earlier this week, just hours before the university abruptly announced his dismissal. The case has quickly become one of the most shocking off-field episodes of the college football season, prompting widespread scrutiny of the allegations and the circumstances surrounding his firing.Here is a detailed look at what Moore has been charged with, the penalties involved and what happens next.The most serious charge Moore faces is third-degree home invasion, a felony under Michigan law. Authorities allege that Moore unlawfully entered the apartment of a woman identified only as someone he “has or has had a dating relationship” with.According to the prosecutor, Moore’s behaviour inside the residence raised significant concern. In a court hearing, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Kati Rezmierski said Moore allegedly entered the kitchen, grabbed several butter knives and scissors and threatened to harm himself, making statements such as, “I’m going to kill myself. I’m going to make you watch.”A third-degree home invasion conviction carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, a $2,000 fine, or both.The allegation forms the foundation of the case and was a major factor in Michigan’s decision to terminate his contract.Moore also faces a misdemeanor charge of stalking, tied to what authorities describe as repeated unwanted contact with the victim after the end of their relationship. Michigan law defines this as conduct that would cause emotional distress or fear in the targeted individual.If convicted, Moore could face up to one year in jail, a $1,000 fine, and as much as five years of probation. Prosecutors described his actions as “highly threatening and highly intimidating” based on police body-camera footage reviewed before the arraignment.The third charge, entering without permission, is another misdemeanor. It stems from Moore allegedly forcing his way into the victim’s residence without lawful authority. This charge carries a penalty of up to 93 days in jail and a $500 fine.The combination of a felony and two misdemeanors paints a severe legal picture, though Moore’s attorney, Joe Simon, has argued that his client is not a public-safety threat and that he has not yet reviewed the evidence being cited.Moore spent two nights in jail before a judge set his bond at $25,000 cash/surety, with several strict conditions:His next court appearance is scheduled for January 22, 2026, due to the holiday calendar.Moore’s sudden downfall comes less than a year into his head-coaching tenure, which began after Jim Harbaugh’s departure. The Wolverines have appointed Biff Poggi as interim coach while beginning a full search for a permanent replacement.As the legal process unfolds, the focus now shifts to how these charges will develop in court and how Michigan moves forward after one of the most unexpected scandals in program history.","Former Michigan head coach Sherrone Moore is facing a series of serious legal charges after being arrested earlier this week.

LUCKNOW: A Bahraich court, which awarded death penalty to main accused Sarfaraz alias Rinku and sentenced nine others to life imprisonment for the murder of a 22-year-old man during the communal violence that erupted over Durga Puja idol, invoked Manusmriti to stress the necessity of a strong punishment as a deterrent.In his verdict pronounced on Thursday, session judge Pawan Kumar Sharma termed the killing an act of ""extreme barbarity"" that shook the social order and ""tore the fabric of humanity"".The judgment noted the accused not only killed an unarmed young man by riddling his body with bullets, but also subjected him to ""demonic torture"".The victim's feet were burnt in such a manner that even his toenails came off, the judge observed. The act created profound unrest and instability in society, the order stated.Citing a verse from the Manusmriti, the court said in the interest of true justice, punishment must be such that it instils fear in such ""beasts"" in society and restores public confidence in judicial system.It's the fear of punishment alone that prevents an individual from deviating from his moral and civic duties. Punishment protects the people and ensures social order is maintained, the order emphasised, quoting the ancient legal code.Agreeing with the prosecution that the accused had crossed all limits of savagery, the court said: ""Humanity cried out in pain because of their actions; the social order collapsed and reached the brink of disintegration. The faith and trust of an entire section of society were murdered.""The court ruled that the accused deserved the maximum punishment for the brutality displayed. The aggravating circumstances overwhelmingly outweighed the mitigating factors, which were negligible, it held.",Bahraich court awarded death penalty to main accused Sarfaraz alias Rinku and sentenced nine others to life imprisonment for the murder of a 22-year-old man during communal violence.

US President Donald Trump yet again threatened Venezuela to launch an operation on the land ""pretty soon"" and claimed that the drug traffic has gone down by 92 per cent.Speaking to reporters, Trump said: “Drug traffic by sea is down 92%, and nobody can figure out who the rest 8 per cent is because I have no idea. Anybody getting involved in that right now is not doing well. We'll start on land too! It's gonna be starting on land pretty soon!”Pressed if there is anything that the country can do to prevent potential land strikes, Trump said that he did not “want to say that.”“I don’t want to say that, but it’s not only land strikes on Venezuela, it’s land strikes on horrible people that are bringing in drugs and killing our people,” the president added as quoted by CNN.The US has announced new sanctions against members of Nicolás Maduro’s family and ships accused of moving Venezuelan oil.The latest actions followed the seizure of an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela earlier this week.The Treasury Department said it targeted the ships and firms because they help fund what it calls Maduro’s “corrupt narco-terrorist regime.” It also said it was sanctioning three nephews of Maduro’s wife for their involvement in drug trafficking.In the statement, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accused Maduro and his “criminal associates” of flooding the US with drugs that are “poisoning the American people.”","US President Donald Trump yet again threatened Venezuela to launch an operation on the land ""pretty soon"" He claimed that the drug traffic has gone down by 92 per cent.

‘Save US First’: Russia Warns Trump Of ‘Unpredictable Consequences’ After Venezuelan Tanker Seizure





When a US general publicly declared that Mexico was a haven for Russian spies, Mexico’s president at the time dismissed it outright. “We don’t have information on this,” President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters the next day, in March 2022.That was not true.His aides had repeatedly heard from Washington about the increase in Russia’s covert activities in Mexico, according to nine current and former US and Mexican officials. In fact, Lopez Obrador had been told about the problem directly. The CIA had even compiled a list of over two dozen Russian spies posing as diplomats, but Mexican officials refused to kick them out of the country.The US did secure a major promise from Mexico in 2023: Under pressure, Mexico agreed to let US officials weigh in on Russians applying for diplomatic credentials, and they have rejected some of them. But even after a new president took office in Mexico last fall, Russian spies were not expelled. “Mexican govt did help, but they could have done a lot more,” said a Biden era official. .”Mexico’s proximity to the US and the cover provided by tourism for spies to operate has allowed Moscow to significantly ramp up espionage activities in the country in recent years, US officials say. Russia is also increasing disinformation efforts, especially online, to turn Mexicans against America and Europe, causing British and French officials to raise concerns with Mexico’s foreign ministry, officials said.It is not clear whether the US is still pushing for expulsions under President Trump, whose policy toward Russia has swung between courting and threatening the Kremlin.The US-led push to support Ukraine, officials said, drove the Kremlin’s need for more intelligence on Washington, and some of Russia’s most skilled intelligence agents are now based in Mexico’s capital.Russia’s embassy in Mexico City is one of its largest around the world, with 85 diplomats listed there. In contrast, Mexico has 16 diplomats at its Moscow embassy, according to its foreign ministry. The CIA put together thick files on people stationed at the Russian embassy. But the concerns were dismissed as paranoia.Mexico’s tolerance of Russia, US officials say, may reflect the politics of its governing party, Morena, which has at its core many ardent leftists who are deeply suspicious of the US. Russia has openly courted countries in the region, too. The Kremlin for years used Brazil as a launchpad for intelligence officers, and used allies such as Cuba and Venezuela as operational hubs. If the US was supporting Ukraine, then Russia had reasoned it would “start messing” with US neighbours, said a former CIA official. “Mexico is the gateway to Latin America, and the Russians know that.”","The CIA had compiled a list of over two dozen Russian spies posing as diplomats, but Mexican officials refused to kick them out of the country.

Of these, 142 deaths — around 70% — occurred in seven districts of the old Mysuru and Malnad regions: Mysuru, Mandya, Hassan, Chamarajanagar, Kodagu, Shivamogga and Chikkamagaluru, highlighting the seriousness of the problem in these areas.Replying to a question raised by Belthangady MLA Harish Poonja, Forest Minister Eshwar B Khandre said Chamarajanagar, a border district, recorded the highest number of human deaths due to wild animal attacks, with 40 casualties. Kodagu followed with 32 deaths, while Mysuru reported 25, Hassan 19, Chikkamagaluru 18, Shivamogga six, and Mandya two.The highest number of human deaths due to wild animal attacks was recorded in 2023–24, when 65 deaths were reported. In 2025–26, 35 deaths have been recorded so far, up to November.According to Honnur Prakash, a farmers’ leader from Chamarajanagar, wild animal intrusion into areas outside forests has reduced slightly after restrictions were placed on safaris.“However, we need a permanent solution to this problem,” he said.He added that civil works inside forests, such as lake development and borewell projects, are forcing wild animals to venture out of forest areas. “Farmers are not trained in how to respond when they spot wild animals. The forest department must become more proactive,” he said.","Nearly 70% of human deaths caused by wild animal attacks in Karnataka have been reported from seven districts in the old Mysuru and Malnad regions since 2022–23.

China, Russia SLAM Trump After U.S. Military 'HIJACKS' Oil Vessel Off Venezuela





COPENHAGEN: The US is using its economic power to “assert its will” and threaten military force against friend and foe alike, a Danish intelligence agency said in a new report. The Danish Defense Intelligence Service said Washington’s greater assertiveness under the Trump administration also comes as China and Russia seek to diminish Western, especially US’, influence.Perhaps most sensitive to Denmark — a Nato and EU member, and a US ally — is growing competition between those great powers in the Arctic. “The strategic importance of the Arctic is rising as the conflict between Russia and the West intensifies, and the growing security and strategic focus on the Arctic by the US will further accelerate these developments,” said the report, published Wednesday.The report echoes a string of recent concerns about an increasingly go-it-alone approach by the US, which under Trump’s second term has favoured bilateral deals and partnerships at the expense of multilateral alliances like Nato. “For many countries outside the West, it has become a viable option to forge strategic agreements with China rather than the US,” read the report. “At the same time, uncertainty has grown over how the US will prioritise its resources in the future,” it added.“The US is leveraging economic power to assert its will, and the possibility of employing military force – even against allies – is no longer ruled out,” the report said.","The US is using its economic power to ‘assert its will’ and threaten military force against friend and foe alike.
