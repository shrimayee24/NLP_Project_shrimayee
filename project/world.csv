Security forces drove away a mob that tried to target CM N Biren Singh's vacant ancestral home outside Imphal.State government imposed a curfew in Imphal East, Imphal West and Bishnupur districts from 4.30pm indefinitely and suspended internet and mobile data services in Imphal East, Imphal West, Bishnupur, Thoubal, Kakching, Kangpokpi, and Churachandpur to curb the spread of hate speech and inflammatory videos on social media. The bodies are suspected to be that of six missing inmates from a camp for displaced Meitei people near the site where security forces killed 10 Hmar men on November 11.

They also opposed the re-imposition of AFSPA in several areas. Residences of BJP legislators, including CM Biren Singh's son-in-law Rajkumar Imo Singh, Raghumani Singh, and Sapam Kunjakeswor, were attacked. Independent MLA Sapam Nishikanta's house was also targeted. Protesters stormed the homes of health minister Sapam Ranjan and consumer affairs minister L Susindro Singh in Imphal.The Union government Saturday acknowledged the “fragile” security situation in Manipur. “Armed miscreants from both communities in conflict have been indulging in violence, leading to unfortunate loss of lives and disruption in public order,” it said, directing security forces to restore peace.Biren Singh’s government requested home ministry to review and withdraw its Nov 14 decision whereby parts of five districts under six police stations were designated as disturbed and AFSPA was reinstated in these areas. Meitei Heritage Society (MHS) condemned abductions and killings in the strongest terms. “We are shocked beyond words, and nothing less than an exemplary capital punishment would do justice for victims.

Trump opens the Gaetz of hell after winning trifecta,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-opens-the-gaetz-of-hell-after-winning-trifecta/articleshow/115307656.cms,"TOI Correspondent from Washington:

MAGA supremo Donald Trump clinched a trifecta on Thursday, winning a narrow Republican majority in the House of Representatives in addition to bagging the White House and the Senate. But right from the get-go, the President-elect is testing the limits of his hold on the Grand Old Party (GOP) now infused with MAGA fervor, choosing controversial young loyalists for key posts in his upcoming administration in moves some Republican grandees see as outrageous.If Trump's pick of Tulsi Gabbard as the country's intelligence czar alarmed the US strategic community, his choice of Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz for the post of Attorney General has stunned even GOP lawmakers, some of whom have accused the Florida maverick of sexual misconduct and deviant behavior. At least two Republican lawmakers have explicitly accused Gaetz, 42, of sexual relations with underaged girls, with the spat on this issue pre-dating the 2024 elections.Moments after Trump named him on Wednesday as the putative Attorney General (he will have to be confirmed by the US Senate), Gaetz resigned from the Congressional seat he had just won from Florida, ostensibly to pre-empt a House Ethics Committee report relating to the allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug that was to be released shortly. The report cannot become public if he is not a member of the House (his resignation was accepted with alacrity by the Republican speaker), but anticipation of a media leak is keeping lawmakers on tenterhooks.Gaetz, and for that matter Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Hegseth, Trump's nominees for Director of National Intelligence and Defense Secretary respectively, will have to undergo a trial by fire in the US Senate confirmation hearings after the President-elect takes office on January 20, 2025. Technically, Presidential appointments for cabinet members and high-ranking administration posts have to be made ""with the advice and consent of the Senate,"" but Senators, who have long prided themselves on being independent-minded, can torpedo nominations by voting them down. The confirmation hearings are also preceded by extensive background checks by intelligence and security agencies, and nominations are often withdrawn if there are any adverse reports.Republicans will have a 53-47 majority in the Senate, and while a majority of the Senators are Trump loyalists , there are independent-minded holdouts who can trip up nominations if they consider them to be unqualified, national security risks, or pose a danger to the party's fortunes. Sometimes they do so out of personal pique.At least four Senators, including Iowa's Chuck Grassley (at 91, the oldest member), Maine's Susan Collins, and Alaska's Lisa Murkowski, appear to have reservations about some of Trump nominees, and along with anti-Trumper Mitt Romney, they could trip up the President. Perhaps anticipating this, Trump is insisting on powers to make recess appointments that would circumvent the confirmation process and allow him to install nominees without congressional hearings.“Any Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments. IMMEDIATELY!” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform in a warning shot after MAGA’s preferred choice of Senate leader, Rick Scott, lost out to a more moderate John Thune. Trump's MAGA acolytes such as Senator Tommy Tuberville warned that lawmakers opposing the President-elect's choices will risk losing their seats, arguing that Trump had the mandate to make appointments as he chooses.The Gaetz nomination will be particularly fraught for Trump considering there has already been a circular firefight involving the Florida maverick and senior Republican lawmakers. After losing a scrap to be the House leader, Trump critic-turned-loyalist Kevin McCarthy said “I'll give you the truth why I'm not speaker. It's because one person, a member of Congress, wanted me to stop an ethics complaint because he slept with a 17-year-old.” Another GOP lawmaker, TonyGonzales from Texas, was more blunt on a tv show, saying, “I serve with some real scumbags. Matt Gaetz, he paid minors to have sex with him at drug parties.”","President-elect is testing the limits of his hold on the Grand Old Party.

Melania Trump’s second term as first lady won't be full-time in White House,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/melania-trumps-second-term-as-first-lady-wont-be-full-time-in-white-house-report/articleshow/115277202.cms,"Melania Trump is unlikely to reside full-time in Washington during her potential second tenure as first lady , demonstrating her independent approach to this unelected but prominent position.According to multiple sources who spoke to CNN, discussions about her living arrangements are still in progress.She has already declined the traditional meeting with current first lady Jill Biden at the White House, where President Biden hosted the president-elect on Wednesday. Despite Trump's team emphasising the importance of her attendance following Jill Biden's invitation, her office cited a book-related scheduling conflict. This was confirmed on X Wednesday morning.This decision suggests that Trump, who previously redefined the role during her first term, is establishing her independence early for her potential second tenure.""I'm not anxious because this time is different. I have much more experience and much more knowledge. I was in the White House before. When you go in, you know exactly what to expect,"" Trump said in a recent Fox News interview whilst promoting her memoir.Sources familiar with the situation indicate she plans to divide her time primarily between New York City and Palm Beach, Florida, rather than Washington, though they affirm she will maintain her first lady duties and attend significant events. Donald Trump is expected to continue his pattern of spending winter weekends at Mar-a-Lago and summer weekends at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club. The Bidens have similarly split their time between Washington and Delaware, though maintaining the White House as their primary weekday residence.Sources indicate that Melania Trump has established a social circle in Florida over the past four years and is likely to maintain these connections.Following the 2016 election, she delayed her White House move until after her son Barron, then 10, completed his school year. Barron, now 18, attends New York University.Sources suggest she will spend considerable time at Trump Tower in New York to be near Barron. She was observed returning with him from Florida on the president-elect's private aircraft on Sunday.""I could not say I'm an empty nester. I don't feel that way,"" Melania Trump told Fox News' Ainsley Earhardt last month.""It was his decision to come here, that he wants to be in New York, study in New York, and live in his home and I respect that. … He's enjoying his college days. I hope he will have a great experience because his life is very different than any other 18-, 19-year-old child,"" she said.This unprecedented arrangement of a first lady choosing not to reside full-time at the White House aligns with Melania Trump's established pattern of non-traditional behaviour.","Melania Trump is unlikely to reside full-time in Washington during her potential second tenure as first lady.

Presidential aspirations and party switch

Prominence in Trump's circle

Military service and intelligence background

Intelligence sector reform plans

US President-elect Donald Trump selected Tulsi Gabbard , an ex-Democratic congresswoman turned staunch supporter, as director of national intelligence on Wednesday. Gabbard , who holds the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve and has combat experience in Iraq, has consistently challenged established foreign policy views.Her selection reflects Trump's preference for appointing foreign policy sceptics who question American military interventions abroad.Trump's official announcement praised Gabbard's ""fearless spirit"" and her potential contribution to intelligence agencies , emphasising ""peace through strength."" The announcement noted her transition from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party , saying she switched ""because of President Trump's leadership and how he has been able to transform the Republican Party, bringing it back to the party of the people and the party of peace.""Roger Stone, Trump's long-time associate who received a presidential pardon in 2020, initially shared the news on his X account, publishing the statement he claimed came directly from Trump.If confirmed, Gabbard would work alongside John Ratcliffe, Trump's CIA director nominee, as a principal intelligence adviser to the White House. Her responsibilities would include managing 18 intelligence organisations and coordinating the President's Daily Brief, a crucial morning intelligence summary.Gabbard was born in American Samoa and raised in Hawaii. Her political career began at 21 in Hawaii's House of Representatives, interrupted by her National Guard deployment to Iraq.As the first Hindu member of the House, she took her oath on the ""Bhagavad Gita"". She also holds the distinction of being the first American Samoan in Congress. During her four terms, she notably challenged her party's leadership. Her early backing of senator Bernie Sanders' 2016 campaign elevated her national profile amongst progressives.Her family includes her spouse, cinematographer Abraham Williams, and her father, Mike Gabbard, a state senator who transitioned from Republican to Democrat.Her 2020 Democratic presidential campaign emphasised a progressive agenda and opposition to American military interventions. She highlighted how US Middle Eastern conflicts had destabilised the region and compromised American safety. During the primaries, she notably confronted then-senator Kamala Harris about her prosecutorial record.After withdrawing and supporting Biden's candidacy, she later left the Democratic Party, criticising it as controlled by ""an elitist cabal of warmongers"" and ""woke"" ideologues. She subsequently aligned with Republicans, joined Fox News, and launched a podcast.""Today's Democratic Party is unrecognisable from the party I joined 20 years ago,"" she said regarding her departure.Her endorsement of Trump this year significantly boosted her standing among his supporters. Frequently appearing with Robert F Kennedy Jr, Gabbard exemplified Trump's claimed cross-party appeal. She assisted Trump's debate preparation against Harris and publicly announced her Republican Party membership at a North Carolina rally in October, describing the Democratic Party as ""completely unrecognizable"".Trump has included both Gabbard and Kennedy in his transition team, potentially influencing staffing and policy decisions in a future administration.Gabbard's military career spans over twenty years in the Army National Guard, including deployments to Iraq and Kuwait. She received recognition with a Combat Medical Badge in 2005 for service during Operation Iraqi Freedom III, as confirmed by the Hawaii National Guard.Unlike her predecessors, she lacks senior government experience, though she served two years on the House Homeland Security Committee.The current director, Avril Haines, confirmed in 2021, brought extensive national security and intelligence experience and made history as the first female director.Trump intends to restructure intelligence services, which he views with scepticism. He attributes past challenges to intelligence agencies' alleged interference with his previous administration and campaigns.He frequently references the ""deep state"", describing career civil servants whom he considers insufficiently loyal. ""We will clean out all of the corrupt actors in our national security and intelligence apparatus, and there are plenty of them,"" Trump declared in 2023, outlining second-term priorities.The director's role, established in 2004 post-9/11, aims to enhance interagency cooperation and prevent intelligence failures. The office has been crucial in identifying and exposing disinformation from Russia, China, and Iran regarding voting and democracy before recent elections. Its responsibilities extend to cybersecurity, counterterrorism, and counterespionage","Tulsi Gabbard is the first Hindu member of the House of Representatives.

US Election 2024 Results: 'Nostradamus' Allan Lichtman blames Elon Musk after getting US election result wrong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nostradamus-allan-litchman-blames-elon-musk-after-getting-us-election-result-wrong/articleshow/115302097.cms,"Lichtman’s Prediction Shock



Inside the “Keys to the White House” Model



Concerns Over Democracy



Evaluating the Keys: A System Under Strain



Reflections on a Missed Prediction and Changing Political Dynamics



The Fragility of Democracy in the 21st Century



Allan Lichtman , often referred to as the ""Nostradamus"" of US Presidential Polls, has attributed his incorrect prediction—suggesting Vice President Kamala Harris would win the US election—to disinformation and billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk. Lichtman, renowned for his accurate forecasting of nine out of the last ten US elections, had correctly predicted nine out of ten election outcomes. However, last week, the historian and political scientist’s prediction that Kamala Harris would win the US Presidential election proved incorrect, with Republican Donald Trump returning to the White House.Speaking with News Nation, Allan Lichtman, a professor at American University, elaborated on the reasons for his incorrect forecast, citing conservative media platforms and Elon Musk, who reportedly invested millions in Donald Trump’s campaign, as contributing factors. Lichtman also criticised Musk for amplifying disinformation online on topics such as immigration, hurricane relief, and the war in Ukraine, ""tipping the scales,"" as the News Nation report noted.“Disinformation is the primary issue,” Lichtman stated during an appearance on Chris Cuomo’s NewsNation show. “We’ve always had disinformation, but it’s now reached unprecedented levels. Much of the grievances this election were fuelled by it.” He continued, “Scholars have shown that when truth dissolves, democracy follows. Authoritarian regimes take hold not through force but through the manipulation of information, as George Orwell warned in 1984, where war is peace and famine is plenty.”""The basis of my system, the Keys to the White House, is that a rational, pragmatic electorate assesses if the governing party deserves another four years. But when disinformation drives the electorate's view of that party, especially from individuals with immense financial influence, perhaps the foundation of the Keys needs re-evaluation,"" Lichtman concluded.For over forty years, Allan Lichtman has used his ""Keys to the White House"" model with remarkable accuracy, having correctly predicted every presidential winner since 1984. The 77-year-old American University professor was confident that Kamala Harris would win the 2024 election, with his model’s indicators pointing towards a Democratic victory. However, as the results confirmed Trump’s sweeping win, Lichtman found himself blindsided, live-streaming his disbelief with his son, Sam. The political forecaster was left questioning what had gone wrong, joking, “Good thing I’ve nothing on tomorrow. No interviews for me.”American historian Allan Lichtman, often dubbed the ""Nostradamus of US elections,"" was left speechless when his prediction of Kamala Harris’ victory in the 2024 US Presidential Elections was proven incorrect. Lichtman and his son, Sam, hosted a six-hour YouTube livestream, during which he expressed his bewilderment, saying, “I don’t get it,” as Trump moved steadily towards a victory.Visibly tired and disappointed by the outcome, Lichtman remarked, “Good thing I’ve nothing to do tomorrow. And I’m not doing any interviews.” He added, “The democracy is gone.” Meanwhile, battles in Nevada, North Carolina, and Arizona remained “too close to call.”Reflecting on the state of democracy, Lichtman noted, “Once democracy is gone, it’s almost impossible to recover. The way to recover is by dictators losing wars.” On 6 November, Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump clinched a historic victory, surpassing the majority required to defeat Kamala Harris. Trump celebrated the outcome as a “magnificent victory for the American people,” thanking his supporters.Lichtman expressed his frustration, hoping that Trump would serve his term and that “we never have to deal with him again.” He struggled to comprehend “how that many people can just ignore all the stuff he did in 2020,” describing Trump as “too lazy to govern the country.” Wrapping up the livestream, Lichtman urged, “Democracy is precious, but like all precious things, it can be destroyed. And typically destroyed from within. Throughout the 21st century, democracy has been in decline globally, and America has now joined that trend. But never give up hope. Never stop striving. Never stop trying, especially you young people.”For more than four decades, Lichtman’s ""Keys to the White House"" model has enjoyed a strong track record of accuracy, correctly predicting each presidential winner since 1984. The 77-year-old American University professor expected Harris to win in 2024, relying on the model’s indicators that favoured a Democratic outcome. But Trump’s decisive victory left Lichtman surprised, live-streaming his dismay alongside his son, Sam.Lichtman’s prediction model, the ""13 Keys to the White House,"" is based on 13 true-or-false indicators that assess conditions favouring the incumbent party. If six or more of these keys turn “false,” the model predicts a loss for the incumbent. The keys encompass factors like economic performance, social stability, candidate charisma, and major policy achievements. Lichtman believed Harris had eight keys in her favour, while Trump fell short on several counts, pointing to a clear Democratic path to victory.In his forecast, Lichtman highlighted Harris’s strengths in areas like “No Primary Contest,” “Strong Long-term Economy,” and “No Foreign or Military Failures.” These indicators usually benefit the incumbent party when stable or positive. Yet, despite these favourable indicators, the electorate leaned unexpectedly towards Trump, leading to his decisive win. This miss by the ""Keys"" model underscores its limitations in capturing an increasingly unpredictable political climate.As the election results became evident, Lichtman’s initial disbelief turned into deeper concerns about democracy’s future. During the livestream, he lamented, “Oh, democracy’s gone,” voicing his fears of an era marked by the fragility of democratic institutions. His apprehensions went beyond his failed prediction, revealing a broader concern about the future of democratic governance, especially given Trump’s divisive leadership style and its impact on political norms.Lichtman pointed out that once democracy erodes, restoring it becomes a significant challenge. He referenced historical cases where authoritarian regimes ended only after substantial upheavals, like wars or social revolutions. His son, Sam, tried to reassure him, optimistically suggesting that Trump’s influence might diminish post-presidency. But Lichtman remained sceptical, warning that “Democracy is precious, but like all precious things, it can be destroyed.” He noted the troubling global trend of eroding democratic norms throughout the 21st century.Since its creation, Lichtman’s model has been celebrated as a strong alternative to traditional polling, which often misses subtle shifts in voter sentiment. Developed from a study of presidential elections from 1860 to 1980, the ""Keys to the White House"" model aimed to cut through polling noise and focus on the broader factors that shape elections. The model’s 13 true/false questions support or oppose the incumbent’s chances, with “true” answers favouring the incumbent party. Key factors include economic stability, absence of scandals, and whether the challenger is charismatic.Below are some key indicators that Lichtman considered crucial:Party Mandate – Incumbents often gain an advantage if they hold a strong congressional majority after midterms.No Primary Contest – Indicates party unity, favouring the incumbent.Strong Long-term Economy – If the economy shows steady growth, it generally supports the incumbent.No Social Unrest – A stable social environment benefits the incumbent.No Scandal – Absence of scandals maintains public trust.Uncharismatic Challenger – This benefits the incumbent if the challenger lacks charisma.In 2024, Lichtman assessed that Harris had eight keys in her favour, indicating a Democratic win. However, the result suggests that underlying political and social dynamics were more complex than the model could capture.With Trump’s victory now a reality, Lichtman’s rare error may highlight how shifting political dynamics affect the reliability of traditional forecasting. Modern elections increasingly present unexpected factors, like disinformation, polarisation, and changing voter loyalty. While historically insightful, Lichtman’s model may face challenges in adapting to the electorate’s evolving motivations.Additionally, the 2024 election was marked by heightened emotion and intense division across party lines. Trump’s divisive but impactful rhetoric appealed to many voters disillusioned with the status quo. Although Harris appeared to have the advantage, voter sentiment ultimately leaned towards a familiar figure promising change, despite his controversial approach.For Lichtman, the 2024 result symbolises more than a missed prediction. His comments on democracy’s precarious state underscore a broader concern: that American democracy, like others worldwide, is under strain. Rising polarisation, erosion of institutional norms, and the spread of populism have altered the landscape. Lichtman worries these trends could destabilise democracy if left unchecked.The historian’s warnings echo broader anxieties about the potential consequences of leadership that disregards democratic values. He urged vigilance, reminding those who value democracy not to lose hope. While democracy is fragile, it can also be resilient—if people remain committed to protecting it.In uncertain times, Lichtman’s insights remind us that no model is infallible, but the continued pursuit of truth, transparency, and democratic values is essential. As he concluded, “Never give up hope.” This sentiment transcends his prediction, offering a hopeful message to those committed to upholding democracy in an unpredictable world.","Allan Lichtman, often referred to as the ""Nostradamus"" of US Presidential Polls, has attributed his incorrect prediction to disinformation and billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk.

Israel intensifies attacks

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's house was targeted Saturday, with two flash bombs landing in the garden of his residence in Caesarea.According to a joint statement from the police and Shin Bet, the flares landed in the courtyard of the property. Netanyahu and his family were not present during the incident.“This is a serious incident and a dangerous escalation,” the statement said, confirming that an investigation has been launched. Israeli President Isaac Herzog described the incident as deeply alarming, warning against growing violence in the public sphere. “I have spoken with the head of the Shin Bet and stressed the urgent need to identify and bring those responsible to justice,” Herzog said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.Defence minister Israel Katz also condemned the attack as crossing “all red lines.” Katz highlighted the dual threats faced by the Prime Minister, both from external adversaries like Iran and Hezbollah and, alarmingly, from within Israel itself.This incident follows a prior attack on Netanyahu’s residence in October, when a drone, claimed by the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, targeted the property. At the time, Netanyahu accused Hezbollah of attempting to assassinate him and his wife, vowing to continue the fight against Iran’s proxies. “We are going to win this war.”Hezbollah, which has been engaged in cross-border fire with Israeli forces, has escalated its activities in recent weeks. On the same day as the flare attack, a synagogue in Haifa was struck by a Hezbollah rocket barrage, injuring two people. The Israeli military reported intercepting several projectiles launched from Lebanon, but others hit northern towns, prompting air raid sirens across the region.Israeli forces intensified operations in southern Lebanon on Saturday as Hezbollah launched its largest wave of projectiles yet, marking a significant escalation in the conflict. The Israeli military reported that Hezbollah had fired approximately 80 projectiles, including rockets and mortars, from Lebanon into Israel by late evening.Israeli troops briefly advanced to a strategic hill in Chamaa, a southern Lebanese village, before retreating after clashes with Hezbollah fighters. Lebanese state media reported that Israeli forces destroyed several structures in the area.Israeli warplanes also struck key locations, including Beirut’s Dahiyeh suburb, a Hezbollah stronghold, and the port city of Tyre. These airstrikes reportedly killed civilians, including a family of six, and caused significant destruction across multiple regions.",Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's house was targeted Saturday. Two flash bombs landed in the garden of his residence in Caesarea. Netanyahu and his family were not present during the incident. Israeli President Isaac Herzog described the incident as deeply alarming.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115375888,imgsize-5109529,width-400,resizemode-4/115375888.jpg"

TEL AVIV: Ahead of the G20 summit in Brazil, Israel dubbed the summary statement addressing the Israel-Gaza conflict ""unbalanced"" and ""biased"" towards the nation and urged to ""include recognition of Israel's right to defend itself.""In a post on X, foreign affairs minister Gideon Sa'ar said that he held telephonic conversations with his counterparts participating in the forum regarding the matter.""Ahead of this week's G20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro , I held phone conversations over the weekend with foreign ministers of countries participating in the forum.

North Korea deploys a new weapon against the South: Unbearable noise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-deploys-a-new-weapon-against-the-south-unbearable-noise/articleshow/115374236.cms,"DANGSAN-RI: Loud, crackly noises that sounded like an ominous, giant gong being beaten again and again washed over this village on a recent night. On other nights, some residents described hearing wolves howling, metal grinding together or ghosts screaming as if out of a horror movie. Others said they heard the sound of incoming artillery, or even a furious monkey pounding on a broken piano.Although they heard different sounds at different times, people in this South Korean village on the border with North Korea all call themselves victims of ""noise bombing,"" saying they find the relentless barrage exhausting.""It is driving us crazy,"" said An Mi-hee, 37. ""You can't sleep at night.""Since July, North Korea has amped up loudspeakers along its border with South Korea for 10 to 24 hours a day, broadcasting eerie noises that have aggravated South Korean villagers like no past propaganda broadcasts from the North ever did. The offensive is one of the most bizarre -- and unbearable -- consequences of deteriorating inter-Korean relations that have sunk to their lowest level in years under the North's leader, Kim Jong Un , and the South's president, Yoon Suk Yeol .For decades, the two Koreas -- which never signed a peace treaty after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce -- have swung between conciliatory tones and saber rattling. Under Kim, Pyongyang has veered toward a more hawkish stance over the past few years. It has shut off all dialogue with Seoul and Washington, doubled down on testing nuclear-capable missiles and has vowed to treat South Korea not as a partner for reunification, but as an enemy that the North must annex should war break out.In the South, Yoon has also adopted a more confrontational approach since taking office in 2022. He has called for spreading the idea of freedom to the North to penetrate the information blackout Kim relies on to maintain his totalitarian rule. South Korea has also expanded joint military drills with the United States and Japan, which involved aircraft carriers, strategic bombers and stealth jets, to deter Kim.Complicating the global picture, North Korea this year strengthened its ties with Russia, shipping weapons and troops to aid its war against Ukraine and striking a mutual defense pact in the event either is attacked.The souring of ties is increasingly affecting the lives of people living along the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea, where Kim's growing hostilities toward the South have taken the form of noise bombardment.""It's bombing without shells,"" An said. As she spoke from her living room, the distant gong-like sounds outside raged on, the noise seeming to grow louder as the night deepened. ""The worst part is that we don't know when it will end, whether it will ever end.""An's village, Dangsan, has a population of 354, with most residents in their 60s and older. It has been one of the hardest hit by North Korea's psychological warfare. Sitting on the northern shore of Gwanghwa Island, west of Seoul, it is only a mile from North Korea, separated by a stretch of gray sea.""I wish they would just broadcast their old insults and propaganda songs,"" said An Seon-hoe, 67, another villager. ""At least they were human sounds and we could bear them.""Since the 1960s, loudspeakers have been as much a fixture of the DMZ as razor-wire fences and land-mine warning signs. People living along the border endured propaganda broadcasts as a part of frontier life, as the rival governments switched them on and off, depending on the political mood.When they were on, both sides insulted each other's leaders as ""puppets."" A female voice that drifted across the 2.5-mile-wide DMZ beckoned South Korean soldiers to defect to ""the people's paradise"" in the North. South Korean broadcasts tried to entice North Korean troops with sugary K-pop tunes.The latest bombardment from the North contains no human sound or music -- just nonstop noises that villagers find hard to describe, other than calling them ""irritating"" and ""stressful."" They have blamed them for insomnia, headaches, and even goats miscarrying, hens laying fewer eggs and the sudden death of a pet dog.The noise was part of a series of steps North Korea has taken to retaliate against what it called South Korean hostility. Recent events might explain why the sounds have become so intolerable.Since his negotiations with President Donald Trump collapsed in 2019, Kim has shifted the course of his country's external relations, turning increasingly hostile toward South Korea, in particular.Some analysts say that by raising tensions, Kim was building the case for why the next American president needed to engage with him as he seeks an easing of international sanctions in return for agreeing to contain his nuclear program. The impending return of Trump, who is now president-elect and with whom Kim met three times during his first term, could increase the chances of the two countries' engaging again after years of silence.But others say Kim's recent rhetoric toward the South reflected a fundamental shift, channeling his belief in the advent of a ""neo-cold war.""The catalyst for this change was waves of anti-Kim propaganda leaflets that were sent across the border via balloons by North Korean defectors living in the South, said Koh Yu-hwan, a former head of the Korea Institute for National Unification. These leaflets called Kim ""a murderous dictator"" or ""pig"" and urged North Koreans to overthrow his government.In May, North Korea retaliated by sending its own balloons to the South, loaded with trash in response to what Pyongyang called political ""filth"" from the South.Weeks later, South Korea ended a six-year hiatus in propaganda broadcasts, switching its loudspeakers back on to blast K-pop and news to the North. The North responded with its blasts of strange, nerve-racking noises.""North Korea knows its propaganda no longer works on South Koreans,"" said Kang Dong-wan, an expert on North Korea at Dong-A University in the South. ""The goal of its loudspeakers has changed from spreading propaganda to forcing South Korea to stop its own broadcasts and leaflets.""Until inter-Korean tensions caught up with them, Dangsan residents were proud of their quiet rural life despite their proximity to the border. They grew red peppers and thick radishes in their gardens. Cats sauntered under persimmon trees strung with heavy fruits. Wild geese took off from harvested rice fields in a chorus of honking.These days, however, villagers keep their windows shut to minimize the noise from North Korea. Some have installed Styrofoam over them for extra insulation. Children no longer play on outdoor trampolines because of the noise.Political leaders have visited Dangsan to offer their sympathies. During a parliamentary hearing last month, a teary An Mi-hee knelt before lawmakers, asking for a solution. But officials suggested neither a plan to de-escalate the psychological war with the North nor a solution to the noise, villagers said, other than offering double-pane windows for villagers and medication for their livestock to better endure the stress caused by the noise.""The solution is for the two Koreas to recommit themselves to their old agreements not to slander each other,"" said Koh, of the Korea Institute. But things have only worsened. Last month, North Korea demolished all railway and road links between the two Koreas with dynamite. This month, it disrupted GPS signals near the western border with the South, affecting some civilian ship and air traffic, according to the South Korean military.Residents near the border have grown weary of ebbs and flows of tensions on the peninsula. An's father, An Hyo-cheol, 67, the village chief of Dangsan, urged the South Korean government to stop what some villagers called a ""childish"" shoving match with the North. He demanded that the Yoon administration stop all propaganda broadcasts and ban leaflets, to encourage the North to follow suit.Dangsan residents said they were being sacrificed in the uncompromising political rivalry between the two Koreas.""The government has abandoned us because we are small in number and mostly old people,"" said Park Hae-sook, 75, a villager. ""I can't imagine the government doing nothing if Seoul suffered the same noise attack as we have.""Shortly after she spoke, the afternoon offensive started with faint metallic howls coming across the border.","Since July, North Korea has amped up loudspeakers along its border with South Korea. The eerie noises have aggravated South Korean villagers like no past propaganda broadcasts. The offensive is one of the most bizarre -- and unbearable -- consequences of deteriorating relations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115374258,imgsize-404984,width-400,resizemode-4/115374258.jpg"

Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday pledged to work with the incoming administration of US President-elect Donald Trump , highlighting the importance of maintaining stability in US-China relations His remarks came during a meeting with outgoing US President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum in Lima, Peru. This marked their first meeting in seven months, as both leaders addressed critical global issues, including trade disputes, cybercrimes, tensions over Taiwan , and the ongoing influence of Russia.Xi acknowledged the historical challenges between the two nations but reiterated China’s consistent aim of fostering a stable, healthy, and sustainable relationship with the US, adding that Beijing is ready to maintain communication, expand cooperation, and manage differences with the Trump administration. Biden noted the frank and candid nature of his discussions with Xi, highlighting the importance of dialogue even in times of disagreement.The meeting occurred amid heightened tensions, as Trump prepared to take office in two months. His campaign promises, including imposing 60% tariffs on Chinese imports under his “America First” trade agenda, have already caused unease in Beijing.Biden’s administration has attempted to manage multiple flashpoints in the relationship, including allegations of China-linked cyberattacks targeting US government communications, growing pressure on Taiwan, and Beijing’s support for Russia in the Ukraine conflict.Meanwhile, Taiwan’s leadership has been a source of contention, with reports of President Lai Ching-te planning sensitive stopovers in the US and former economy minister Lin Hsin-i inviting Biden to visit Taiwan, moves likely to provoke Beijing. China continues to view Taiwan as its territory, while the US remains its most significant international backer, supplying arms despite lacking formal diplomatic ties.Beijing’s economy has faced significant challenges due to US trade policies under Biden, including restrictions on investments in Chinese technology sectors like artificial intelligence and quantum computing, as well as export controls on advanced semiconductors. These measures have compounded domestic pressures, creating economic strains that loom large over bilateral discussions.As Xi outlined the potential paths forward, he stressed that mutual respect and cooperation could foster progress in the relationship, while antagonism and competition would risk setbacks.Xi’s visit to the Apec summit also marked a broader diplomatic push to expand China’s influence in Latin America, a region long dominated by US interests. During his trip, Xi signed a refurbished free-trade agreement with Peru, inaugurated the Chancay deep-water port, and announced plans to host the Apec summit in 2026.","Xi Jinping pledged to work with the incoming administration of US President- elect Donald Trump.

Some associate these symbols with the Crusades and, more recently, with white supremacist groups.He responded to the controversy following a social media post from newly-elected vice president JD Vance, who criticised the news agency Associated Press (AP) for 'attacking' Hegseth over his tattoo and accused them of 'anti-Christian bigotry.'Hegseth echoed Vance’s statement about 'anti-Christian bigotry' on X, saying:""Amen @JDVance. Anti-Christian bigotry in the media on full display. They can target me — I don’t give a damn — but this type of targeting of Christians, conservatives, patriots and everyday Americans will stop on DAY ONE at DJT’s DoD.""Earlier, AP Pentagon correspondent Tara Copp had shared on X that Hegseth was flagged as a possible ""insider threat"" by a fellow service member due to his tattoo, providing a link to an AP report supporting the claim.Vance defended Hegseth, calling the AP's reporting ""disgusting anti-Christian bigotry.""“They're attacking Pete Hegseth for having a Christian motto tattooed on his arm. This is disgusting anti-Christian bigotry from the AP, and the entire organization should be ashamed of itself,” Vance wrote.While Hegseth has numerous tattoos, the controversy primarily centers around his “Deus Vult” tattoo on his arm. However, in the past, due to a tattoo on his chest, he was not allowed to work security at President Joe Biden's 2021 inauguration because military higher-ups believed the tattoo might be an extremist symbol.","Pete Hegseth, US President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of defense, is facing criticism for his tattoos.

Music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs has allegedly attempted to contact potential witnesses from jail and sway public opinion to influence jurors in his upcoming sex trafficking trial, prosecutors claimed in a Friday court filing, urging the judge to deny his latest bail request .Combs, currently held in a Brooklyn detention center, faces charges of coercion and abuse of women over several years.Prosecutors, in the court documents, outlined Combs’ alleged efforts to manipulate witnesses and public opinion from jail, including orchestrating social media campaigns. They said that a review of recorded calls revealed Combs instructing family members to influence witnesses' narratives and discussing marketing strategies to shape public perception.""The defendant has repeatedly shown — even while in custody — that he will flout rules to improperly impact the outcome of his case,"" prosecutors stated in the filing, adding that he ""cannot be trusted to abide by conditions.""Prosecutors alleged that Combs' behavior indicates an intent to manipulate victims and witnesses, arguing that he may be attempting to coerce them into remaining silent or giving testimony favorable to his defense.Prosecutors further claimed that Diddy began violating rules shortly after his arrival at the prison following his arrest in September.According to prosecutors, Combs involved his children in his efforts, encouraging them to post a birthday tribute video on social media, which he then analyzed for its potential impact on jurors.These actions, prosecutors argued, justify his continued detention and demonstrate a pattern of witness intimidation and manipulation of the legal process.Despite two prior bail requests being denied, Combs’ lawyers recently filed a third proposal, citing new evidence. However, prosecutors maintain that his alleged attempts to influence witnesses reflect a continued disregard for legal proceedings.A bail hearing is scheduled for next week, with Combs’ trial set to begin on May 5.","Diddy faces charges of coercion and abuse of women over several years.

Florida Democratic representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz on Friday claimed that Tulsi Gabbard , US President-elect Trump's pick for director of national intelligence , is ""likely a Russian asset ,"" sparking widespread criticism.Wasserman made the statement during an MSNBC interview.""She is considered, by most assessments, essentially a Russian asset and would be the most dangerous,"" Schultz said. The host then interrupted and asked, ""Is that what you consider her?""Wasserman stood firm in her claim, responding, ""Yes. There's no question. I consider her someone who is likely a Russian asset who, as the DNI, would be responsible for managing our entire intelligence community, holding all of our most significant intelligence information and secrets, and essentially would be a direct line to our enemies.""She also pointed to Gabbard's 2017 meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has been accused of using chemical weapons against his own people.“Tulsi Gabbard is someone who has met with war criminals, violated the Department of State's guidance, and secretly went to Syria to meet with Assad, who gassed and attacked his own people with chemical weapons,” Schultz said.Wasserman's statement has drawn widespread criticism on social media.

She has been a vocal critic of the Democratic party, which she once called a ""bunch of warmongers.""This is not the first time accusations of ties to Russia have been leveled against Gabbard. In 2019, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton suggested Gabbard was favored by Russia, citing apparent support from Russian media.Gabbard has a long history of military service, having served in Iraq and currently holding the rank of lieutenant colonel in the US Army Reserves.Trump praised her military background and bipartisan appeal when announcing her nomination.

Like it or Leavitt: Trump picks 27-year old as youngest WH Press Secretary in history,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/like-it-or-leavitt-trump-picks-27-year-old-as-youngest-wh-press-secretary-in-history/articleshow/115362743.cms,"TOI Correspondent from Washington:

The oldest man to win the US Presidency will have the youngest press secretary in White House history.MAGA supremo and President-elect Donald Trump on Friday named Karoline Leavitt , 27, as the White House press secretary , one of the most visible jobs in the world, continuing his rapid staffing of an administration that still has two months to go befoe assuming office.Leavitt, mother of a three-month old infant, worked most recently as his campaign press secretary after serving in his first term as an assistant to four White House press secretaries he cycled through. A former Fox News intern, she is known for her combative style and disdain for the mainstream liberal media she shares with Trump.Also read: Is Biden taller than Trump? White House photo sparks height discussions on social media “Karoline is smart, tough, and has proven to be a highly effective communicator,” Trump said in a statement announcing her promotion. “I have the utmost confidence she will excel at the podium, and help deliver our message to the American People as we, Make America Great Again.”Leavitt trumped other prospects like Trump's lawyer Alina Habba and his confidante Laura Loomer for the high-profile job that involves daily appearance -- if Trump wishes so -- on the White House press room lectern. During Trump's first term, weeks passed without a daily briefing as the MAGA supremo himself, never short of words, often took charge of the podium.Leavitt, a 2019 B.A graduate, ran for Congress in New Hampshire in 2022 and lost, adopting positions so far right that she was reportedly dubbed KKKaroline in the state's political circles. One MAGA fans described her ""everything the left hates, young, straight, blonde, Christian, beauty, brains and a mother!""Her nomination is in line with Trump's picks so far of MAGA loyalists regardless of age, experience, or qualifications, in an effort to break the stranglehold of the old school Washington establishment.Some of the nominees have already generated a backlash even within the Republican Party even as Democrats are apoplectic over what they see as an impending ""kakistocracy"" -- an administration staffed by the country's least suitable or competent citizens. Trump's picks for Defense Secretary and Attorney General have both been rocked by allegations of sexual misdemeanors, with doubts about whether they can pass a confirmation process.On Friday, reports surfaced that Pete Hegseth, Trump’s choice to lead the Defense Department, faced police investigation into allegations that he sexually assaulted a woman in a California hotel in 2017 after a Republican conference. The incident did not result in criminal charges. Trump's AG nominee Matt Gaetz faces even more lurid charges of underaged sex trafficking.The reports have alarmed Republican Senate grandees who would typically be tasked with confirming the nominees, but Trump has indicated he would simply work around the process with recess appointments, even as MAGA loyalists are ready to rubberstamp the appointments because they believe the President-elect has the mandate to do as he likes.","Karoline Leavitt, 27, will be the youngest press secretary in White House history.
