I don’t have a small clue: MLA Byrathi Basavaraj





BENGALURU: A 44-year-old man with a criminal background was hacked to death by a group of assailants near Halasuru Lake in Bengaluru on Tuesday night, in what police suspect may be linked to a property dispute.The mother of the deceased has filed a complaint naming KR Pura MLA Byrathi Basavaraj and others, alleging they were involved in the murder.The victim, Shiva Prakash alias Bikkalu Shiva, was a resident of Meanee Avenue Road in Hermit Colony, Sivanchetti Gardens, and was a rowdy sheeter at the Bharathi Nagar police station with 11 previous criminal cases against him.Police said a rowdy sheet had been opened in his name in 2006 and that he had recently attended a rowdy parade.According to initial investigations, Shiva was attacked in front of a hotel just a few metres from his home around 8.10pm.He had been speaking with his driver, Imran Khan and another friend, Lokesh, when the assailants arrived.he attack was described by police as extremely brutal, with a senior officer telling The Times of India that Shiva’s “skull was smashed into pieces” and his face left “totally disfigured”.Witnesses dining at the hotel reportedly fled in panic. Police have detained five suspects in connection with the murder and are currently questioning them.Mother names MLA, alleges threats and pressure over landIn a formal complaint, Shiva’s 68-year-old mother, Vijayalaxmi, accused MLA Byrathi Basavaraj, along with Jagadish, Kiran, Vimal, Anil and others, of being involved in her son’s death.She claims the murder was linked to a dispute over property in Kithaganur village, East Bengaluru.According to her statement, Shiva had purchased a property in 2023 and was the GPA (General Power of Attorney) holder. He built a shed on the land and appointed two women as security guards.On 11 February, she alleges, a group led by the accused, including Jagadish and Kiran, forcibly evicted the women and demanded Shiva transfer the GPA rights to Jagadish.She further claimed that Jagadish threatened Shiva, saying he would not be spared if he refused. Despite filing a complaint, Vijayalaxmi said Shiva continued to receive threats and had informed his family that his life was in danger.On 13 July, Shiva told his family he would be attending a friend’s birthday party and wouldn’t return that night.He came back on the afternoon of 15 July, had lunch, and then took a nap.Later that evening, he argued with his driver over a delay in delivering his car keys and instructed him to bring the vehicle immediately.Shortly after 8pm, he was seen speaking to Imran and Lokesh near the hotel.Vijayalaxmi said she noticed her son was no longer there when she returned to the balcony a few minutes later.Hearing commotion, she rushed outside and witnessed eight to ten men attacking Shiva with lethal weapons. She said Imran was also attacked when he tried to intervene, while Lokesh allegedly filmed the assault on his phone.The attackers then fled the scene in an SUV and on two-wheelers.The FIR, registered at Bharathi Nagar police station, names MLA Byrathi Basavaraj as Accused No. 5.The case has been filed under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita sections 103 (punishment for murder) and 190 (offence committed in prosecution of common object by unlawful assembly).Investigation underwayJoint Commissioner of Police (East),B Ramesh, said, “We will know the motive behind the murder once we find out who the assailants are.”Police are examining CCTV footage and continuing to question suspects as part of the investigation.Speaking to the media, MLA Byrathi Basavaraj said, ""I don’t have a small clue or information about the incident. I don’t know who Bikkalu Shiva is, where the property is, or any other details. But without reason, my name was included in the FIR, and I got to know about it through the media. I am deeply pained by the development. I will fight against it legally, and I will be contacting the home minister to explain to him that I don’t have any role. ""As mentioned in the media, the deceased filed a complaint with the police many days ago. Why did no one inform me about it or try to get my clarification? I am not sure if it is a political conspiracy or another reason,"" Basavaraj said. ""I will appear before the police if they summon me for questioning about the case,"" he added. Meanwhile police sources say that the investigating officer may serve him notice at the earliest.","Shiva Prakash alias Bikkalu Shiva, 44, hacked to death near Halasuru Lake in Bengaluru.

NEW DELHI: Eleven years after he was arrested for allegedly killing his six family members, including three children, for which he was awarded death sentence by trial court and Punjab and Haryana high court, Supreme Court has acquitted the person saying that there was no credible evidence to prove his guilt and he was being sent to gallows because of court's enthusiasm to deliver justice.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta said the trial court and the HC erred in convicting the person on the basis of statements of alleged eyewitnesses which was full of contradiction and their being present at the site of crime was also doubtful. The court said that the case is a reflection of breakdown of legal system where a person is not only punished but sent to gallows despite no credible evidence.""The breakdown of the legal system becomes apparent when such haste to lay a finger of blame on somebody leads to a shoddy investigation and a poorly conducted trial. The result is a loosely tied prosecution case with glaring loopholes all across and yet the courts' enthusiasm to deliver justice in such a heinous crime ensures that the accused person ends up on the death row, albeit without sufficient evidence. This is precisely the misery which the instant case entails,"" the bench said.The incident occurred in Phagwara in 2014 and it was alleged that the murder was done out of family dispute. Examining threadbare the statement of witnesses, the apex court said they did not inspire confidence and were not reliable.""The internal inconsistencies and lack of corroboration cast serious doubts and snatch away the degree of accuracy that is to be attained while determining the culpability of an accused in cases of murder. W e cannot turn a blind eye to the obvious inconsistencies in the depositions of its main witnesses which indicate deliberate embellishment and coaching, rendering these testimonies unreliable. Therefore, we have no hesitation to hold that no credence can be lent to the testimonies of PW1 and PW2 and their account of being ""eyewitness"" to the incident or having seen the accused has to be discarded,"" the bench said.The trial court has held that dacoity or commission of offence by a stranger party has to be ruled out due to the gruesome nature of the crime but the bench said ""merely lack of an alternative plausible explanation to the incident cannot serve as enough evidence in itself to send a man to the gallows, whose guilt otherwise remains unestablished"".""At the cost of repetition, we must state that the standard of proof is an absolutely strict one and cannot be faltered with. When at stake are human lives and the cost is blood, the matter needs to be dealt with utmost sincerity. Therefore, given the facts and circumstances of the case and in light of the above discussion, we cannot bring ourselves to hold the accused-appellant guilty of the charged offence as his guilt has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt,"" the court said, acquitting the accused who had been in jail for the last 11 years.","A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta said the trial court and the HC erred in convicting the person on the basis of statements of alleged eyewitnesses.

Want retribution, nothing else: Kin of murdered Yemeni man

The family of the Yemeni national for whose murder Kerala-born expat nurse Nimisha Priya was sentenced to death has ruled out accepting any proposal for a pardon, suggesting her execution being postponed at the intervention of Indian authorities and religious leaders, was at best a temporary reprieve.""Nimisha won't be pardoned; she must face execution, as ruled by Yemeni courts,"" online news portals in Yemen quoted murder victim Talal Abdo Mahdi's brother Abdelfattah Mahdi as saying.News of the Yemeni authorities deciding to keep the execution scheduled for Wednesday on hold till further orders came the previous day, raising hope in her native Kerala that there could yet be a breakthrough in negotiations.Abdelfattah dismissed any such possibility, including accepting blood money. ""What is happening today, and all the talk of mediation and reconciliation attempts, is neither new nor surprising,"" he posted on his Facebook page.""Throughout the years of pursuing our case, there were covert efforts and serious attempts at mediation - and that is natural and expected. But the pressures we faced did not change us. Our demand is clear: qisas (retribution) and nothing else, no matter what.""Abdelfattah said the execution being postponed on the eve of the date fixed by the prison authorities on court orders was something the Mahdi family didn't expect.""Those who stopped it are well aware of our absolute rejection of any form or method of reconciliation. We will follow through with the execution until it is carried out... Blood cannot be bought. Justice cannot be forgotten.""Nimisha, who is on death row since 2018, is from Kollengode in Palakkad.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the special committee constituted by the ministry of information and broadcasting to decide by Monday pleas opposing screening of censor board-cleared 'Udaipur Files: Kanhaiya Lal Tailor Murder' on the ground that the movie, based on the beheading of the Udaipur tailor for allegedly blaspheming Prophet Muhammad, marked shocking and vicious vilification of Muslims.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared for Maulana Arshad Madani, and senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy, who appeared for prime accused in Kanhaiya Lal's beheading case Mohammad Javed, argued against release of the film alleging that it vilified a particular community, would prejudice the trial in the murder case, put the accused's life in danger and also derogated the judiciary.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi also asked the police to ensure protection of the producer of the film and his son who have received death threats.For the film producer, senior advocate Gaurav Bhatia told the bench that the film was cleared by Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) after incorporation of 55 cuts. He said the petitioners moved Delhi HC at the eleventh hour to stall release of the film, adding that the producer was suffering huge losses apart from stifling of his free speech.Terming the case a contest between right to free speech and right to life, the Justice Kant-led bench asked the committee constituted by the I&B ministry to decide Madani's representation against the release of the film by Monday, the next date of hearing.It also allowed counsel for the main accused in the beheading case to participate in the proceedings before the committee.The bench those who apprehend the trial getting prejudiced had a right to be heard.It also considered the threats allegedly received by the producer and his son warning them against releasing the film. The SC asked the police to evaluate the threat perception and take appropriate steps to protect them.Sibal said he, as counsel for Madani, had watched the film during an HC-ordered special screening. ""Once I saw the movie, I was shaken in every sense. It is a complete thematic dissertation of hate.""The bench pointed to Sibal's advocacy of free speech and recalled telling the senior advocate that he would one day be arguing against free speech. This is one such occasion, Justice Kant said.Sibal said, ""See the movie. It is something that generates violence... seeds violence. It is complete vilification of one community and not one positive aspect of the community is projected in the movie - violence, homosexuality, denigration of women. It is unthinkable that a democratic nation would allow screening of such a film.""Bhatia said, ""Beheading of the tailor and posting of its video on social media had more than one crore views. Videos were released prior to the beheading and after accomplishment of the sinister and gruesome act. None of the petitioners protested such a posting of video on social media. The film gives a message of communal harmony and is an appeal against violence.""Kanhaiya Lal had apologised for forwarding the post that the killers dubbed as sacrilegious.Guruswamy said the accused Javed would be completely prejudiced during the trial if the film was released. ""Free speech cannot be allowed to vitiate fair trial,"" she said, adding that certain remarks in the film by touching upon two sub-judice cases - the tailor beheading and Gyanvapi - also brought the judiciary into disrepute.Justice Kant said the SC was not bothered about derogatory remarks against the judiciary, as it was used to daily bashing by so-called intellectuals. ""We are used to this kind of bashing every day. Our judicial officers are not school-going children or adolescents to get affected by a movie or get swayed by a few dialogues in a film to decide a case.

Tomorrowland In FLAMES | Main Stage Collapse CAUGHT ON CAM - Fire Sparks Panic & Forest Threat





A major fire on Wednesday (local time) has severely damaged the main stage of world famous Tomorrowland festival in Belgium. This comes just days before its official opening on Friday.In a statement issued Wednesday evening, festival organizers confirmed the incident, “Due to a serious incident and fire on the Tomorrowland Mainstage, our beloved Mainstage has been severely damaged.” They confirmed that no injuries were reported.The fire broke out on Wednesday afternoon, sending thick plumes of black smoke into the sky. Videos circulating online showed fireworks erupting as flames engulfed the structure.Belgium’s public broadcaster VRT reported that the main stage was almost completely destroyed. Emergency services responded swiftly, but the fire was not immediately brought under control.At the time of the fire, no festival-goers were on the site, but approximately 1,000 staff members were present. All have since been safely evacuated.Tomorrowland spokesperson Debby Wilmsen said the destruction was heartbreaking for workers who spent years designing and constructing the stage.Despite the incident, the festival is not being canceled. Organizers confirmed that “DreamVille,” the event’s main campsite, will open on Thursday as planned. “Tomorrow we’re expecting 38,000 festival-goers at DreamVille. We’re really looking forward to it,” Wilmsen said.Wilmsen confirmed that even though the main stage will not be ready in time, the team is working on alternative plans. “We’re going to make it a great festival. It will be without a main stage. But hopefully, we can do something else, but I can’t say much about that yet,” she added.Local residents described the moment the fire broke out. Morgan Hermans, who lives near the site said that she initially heard fireworks and then saw thick smoke. “There was just a big cloud of fireworks and smoke very near us, so that was a bit scary,” she said.“It’s one of the biggest events of the year. Our town is very small, so to welcome people from all over the world is a big deal. Everyone in Boom was a bit terrified for a few seconds,” she added, as reported by CNN.Local police have urged people to avoid the area to allow emergency crews to work. The cause of the fire remains unknown at this time.","Main stage of Tomorrowland festival in Belgium severely damaged by fire.

A 7.3-magnitude earthquake jolted the coast of the US state of Alaska on Wednesday, prompting a tsunami warning , as per the US Geological Survey (USGS).The earthquake struck at approximately 12:37 pm local time (2037 GMT), with its epicentre located about 54 miles (87 km) south of Sand Point, near Popof Island, at the centre of the Alaska Peninsula.The depth was recorded at 20.1 km, making it a relatively shallow quake, which can often be more damaging.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued a tsunami warning for an area covering much of the Alaska Peninsula and extending into the southernmost portion of mainland Alaska, reaching toward Anchorage.According to the National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC) in Palmer, Alaska, “a tsunami has been confirmed and some impacts are expected.” The warning specifically applied to the Pacific coasts from Kennedy Entrance (40 miles southwest of Homer) to Unimak Pass (80 miles northeast of Unalaska).Based on initial assessments, tsunami warnings were not issued for regions beyond Alaska, the NTWC added.A major earthquake is considered to have a magnitude of 7.0 to 7.9 and is capable of causing serious damage. On average, about 10 to 15 such strong earthquakes are recorded globally each year.Alaska lies on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and has experienced powerful quakes in the past.

Gisele Bündchen sets the record straight on Trump’s role in their breakup

A relationship built on sacrifice, now remembered with love and support



Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen’s divorce shocked fans, but one symbol sparked lasting controversy—the MAGA hat in Brady’s locker. As speculation swirled linking Donald Trump to their split, Bündchen finally addressed the rumors in a revealing interview, offering emotional clarity on what really ended their 13-year high-profile marriage.Back in 2015, a red “Make America Great Again” hat quietly sitting in Tom Brady’s locker triggered a wave of controversy that would follow the NFL icon for years. As Donald Trump’s presidential campaign gained momentum, Brady’s casual display of support—paired with public comments calling Trump a “good friend”—sparked heated debate among fans and media.But after Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen finalized their divorce in October 2022, nearly a decade into a marriage that once looked like a fairy tale, the MAGA moment resurfaced once again. Online speculators claimed the quarterback’s ties to Trump may have contributed to the couple’s split. However, in a 2023 Vanity Fair interview, Bündchen finally addressed the issue—and made it clear the narrative had spun far from reality.Speaking candidly about her divorce, the Brazilian supermodel became emotional when reflecting on their 13-year marriage. “It’s like a death and a rebirth,” she said, tearing up.But when asked directly if Trump or the MAGA hat incident played any role in the split, she didn’t hesitate to shut it down: “Never.”Her answer not only challenged the popular theory but also offered a rare glimpse into the deeply personal nature of the couple’s separation. The truth, as Bündchen explained, was far more human and less political. “You give a hundred percent of yourself, and it’s heartbreaking when it doesn’t end up the way you hoped for… but you can only do your part.”Despite being one of the highest-paid models in the world, Bündchen had stepped away from the runway in 2015 to prioritize family life. She poured herself into their home, their children, and Brady’s relentless football career. Though the marriage eventually ended, she harbors no resentment.“Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever,” she said warmly. “If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him… I want him to achieve and to conquer.”Also Read: Is Tom Brady quietly backing Donald Trump?

Trump faces revolt on Epstein case: Republican strongholds push to release files; Democrats eye MAGA divide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-faces-revolt-on-epstein-case-republican-strongholds-push-to-release-files-democrats-eye-maga-divide/articleshow/122610583.cms,"Marjorie Taylor Greene : ‘A punch in the gut’



Nancy Mace: ‘Every platform, every phone call’



Mike Johnson: ‘Put everything out there’



Tim Burchett: ‘Aggravated at Pam Bondi’



Thomas Massie and the Discharge Petition



Democrats aware of the split







A growing number of MAGA-aligned Republican lawmakers are at odds with US President Donald Trump over his administration’s refusal to release more information about pedophile Jeffrey Epstein Once some of Trump’s closest allies, several far-right members of Congress are now publicly criticising his stance on the Epstein case and accusing the administration of backtracking on promises to reveal the full truth about the disgraced financier, reports New York Times.The unrest comes as Trump also faces conservative pushback on foreign policy issues involving Iran and Ukraine.Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who built her political career on populist rage and conspiracy theories, including those linked to Epstein, has emerged as one of the most vocal critics of the administration’s position on Epstein files.“It’s a full reversal on what was all said beforehand, and people are just not willing to accept it,” she told reporters. Referring to the Justice Department’s statement that no further disclosures about Epstein would be “appropriate or warranted,” Greene said, “I don’t accept it, and I don’t think anyone else should accept it.”She added, “It’s a punch in the gut when regular people go to jail all the time, when they mess up and do something wrong, and then it always seems the rich, powerful elites escape.”Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina echoed the frustration, saying that calls for transparency on Epstein have dominated communication with her office.“It’s the only thing we’ve heard about for the last 100 hours,” she said. “It’s every social media platform, every phone call into the office.”Mace said she supported the appointment of a special counsel to investigate whether evidence had been destroyed or key figures had been shielded. “If the Justice Department can be more transparent on this, it would be best for the country,” she said. “People don’t trust the government, and we haven’t given them much reason to over the past few years.”Even Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, a close ally of Trump, has cautiously sided with those seeking more openness.“We should put everything out there and let the people decide,” he said during an appearance on The Benny Show. While Johnson added that it was “not my lane,” he made clear he supported the general call for transparency.Representative Tim Burchett of Tennessee stopped short of criticising Trump directly, but voiced displeasure over Attorney General Pam Bondi’s handling of the case.“I’m aggravated at Pam Bondi, claiming the list is on her desk,” he said, referencing earlier comments from Bondi suggesting she had access to Epstein-related material. Bondi’s department later claimed no such list existed.Still, Burchett avoided placing blame on Trump, saying, “I haven’t spoken to the president about it. I don’t know the reasoning there.”Seeking to force the issue, Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky said he would introduce a discharge petition to compel a floor vote on releasing Epstein files. Discharge petitions, while rarely successful, can bypass leadership if they gather majority support.Massie is also co-sponsoring a bill with Democrat Ro Khanna to declassify all non-sensitive Epstein documents, while protecting the identities of victims.Democrats are closely watching the Republican split. Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland said, “This is definitely not a reason for [Pam Bondi] to resign, because it’s clear that Donald Trump is the one who is calling the tune here.”While some GOP members push for transparency, the party leadership remains aligned with the president. Earlier this week, House Republicans blocked a Democratic proposal that would have forced a debate on the Epstein files. Only one Republican on the Rules Committee, Representative Ralph Norman, broke ranks to vote with Democrats.Still, lawmakers like Representative Marc Veasey, a Democrat from Texas, said the push for the files transcends party lines: “The president makes these claims, and people want to make sure children aren’t being abused.”", MAGA-aligned Republican lawmakers are at odds with US President Donald Trump over his administration’s refusal to release more information about pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

Fighting erupts in Syria







As fresh violence erupted between Israel and Syria, US President Donald Trump welcomed two key Arab Gulf leaders to the White House on Wednesday, aiming to spotlight diplomatic and economic progress in the region despite renewed doubts over Middle East peace efforts.Trump first held talks with Bahrain’s Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa in the Oval Office and was later scheduled to dine privately with Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani.The meetings came amid rising tensions in Syria and criticism over Israel’s military actions in Gaza.Trump focused on showcasing the benefits of closer economic ties. “Anything they needed, we helped them,” Trump said during the meeting with the Bahraini crown prince. “And anything we needed, they helped us.”In a post on Trurh Social, the MAGA supremo said : ""It was my Great Honor to welcome the Prime Minister and Crown Prince of Bahrain today at the White House. We have had a tremendous relationship with Bahrain over the years—and they have been a fantastic ally!""Bahrain is a key US ally and hosts the US Navy’s Fifth Fleet. It brings tangible commitments to the table. Crown Prince Al Khalifa said the kingdom had agreed to $17 billion in investments in the United States.“And this is real,” the crown prince said. “It’s real money. These aren’t fake deals.”According to the White House, the investment package includes the purchase of American aircraft, jet engines and computer servers, with potential future deals in aluminium production and artificial intelligence. A separate agreement was also signed to strengthen cooperation on civilian nuclear energy.Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa is expected to visit Washington before the end of the year to further cement ties.Later on Wednesday, Trump hosted a dinner for Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. The visit follows Trump’s recent trip to the region, which included stops in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar, where he toured luxurious palaces.Trump has reportedly shown interest in replacing his current presidential aircraft with a lavish Boeing 747 donated by Qatar, as Boeing delays the delivery of new Air Force One planes. However, this idea has raised ethical and security concerns about accepting such a gift from a foreign government.Even as Trump hosted the Gulf leaders, fresh conflict broke out in southern Syria. Clashes between Sunni Bedouin tribes and Druze factions prompted intervention by government forces, triggering concerns in Israel, where the Druze are a politically significant minority.Israel responded with strikes in Damascus on Wednesday.US secretary of state Marco Rubio, who was also present for Trump’s meeting with Al Khalifa, described the Syrian conflict as “an unfortunate situation and a misunderstanding.” He added, “we think we’re on our way to a real de-escalation” that could help Syria start rebuilding after years of war.",US President Donald Trump welcomed two key Arab Gulf leaders to the White House on Wednesday.

The US justice department on Wednesday fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, as reported by the news agency AP.Comey was a veteran lawyer in the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. She had worked on several high-profile cases, including the sex trafficking prosecution of financier Jeffrey Epstein and the recent case against rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs.Maurene Comey was considered a highly regarded prosecutor. She successfully helped prosecute Ghislaine Maxwell , Epstein’s former associate, who was convicted for her role in a sex trafficking operation.Earlier this month, she led the trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs, which ended with a split verdict: he was convicted on a prostitution-related charge but acquitted of more serious charges.Recently, Comey has faced criticism from figures within President Trump’s right-wing base. Conservative activist Laura Loomer has urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to remove Comey from her position in May, as reported by Politico.The Trump administration had previously reassigned some justice department lawyers involved in cases perceived as adversarial to the president, and Maurene Comey was considered a potential candidate for such a thing due to her father’s well-known differences with Trump over the past decade.James Comey was serving as FBI director when Donald Trump became president in 2017. He had been appointed to the position by former US President Barack Obama . However, his relationship with Trump was tense from the beginning. During a private dinner, Comey refused a request from Trump to promise personal loyalty.In May 2017, Trump dismissed James Comey while the FBI was investigating possible connections between his presidential campaign and Russia.According to media reports, no specific reason was given for her dismissal. Her firing marks the latest shake-up in the Southern District of New York, which has long been regarded as the most prestigious of the Justice Department’s prosecution offices.","Maurene Comey was a veteran lawyer in the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.

The CEO of an advocacy group revealed that his organization declined an offer reportedly worth around $20 million to help organize a national protest against US President Donald Trump Adam Swart, the founder and CEO of Crowds on Demand, said in an interview on Tuesday that groups associated with the “July 17th Movement” had approached them for support, as reported by Fox News.“Interests aligned with the organizers of the July 17th movement have approached us and, in fact, we rejected an offer that probably is worth around $20 million,” Swart said.The protests, scheduled for Thursday, are being led by Good Trouble Lives On, a group that describes itself as a peaceful, nonviolent protest organization focusing on social change. The group aims to demonstrate against Trump and what it describes as ""the most brazen rollback of civil rights in generations"" on its official website.The date also marks the fifth anniversary of the death of Representative John Lewis, a prominent civil rights activist, who often referred to peaceful protests as creating ""good trouble.""Swart explained that his company which specializes in providing crowds for events and demonstrations declined the offer because they believed the protests would not be impactful.""I mean this is a nationwide thing, right? It’s not to say I would have made 20 million dollars personally, but the value of the contract would have been worth around that amount nationwide to organize huge demonstrations around the country,"" he said.""But personally, I just don’t think it’s effective,"" Swart added. “I’m not trying to seem virtuous by turning it down, I just believe it would be ineffective and make everyone involved look bad.”Responding to reports about the rejected offer, Harrison Fields, special assistant to President Trump and principal deputy press secretary, issued a statement.“President Trump’s America is so successful that blue-haired basement dwellers are paid to stage fake protests against the administration’s remarkable achievements,” Fields said. “Paid agitators should find real jobs instead of selling out for gift cards and meager paychecks that aim to divide the nation and obstruct America’s greatest comeback. Nothing screams a party in disarray more than one that clearly lacks organic support and is forced to astroturf everything. ”Recent incidents involving left-wing protests including violent demonstrations in Los Angeles, where American flags were burned and police officers assaulted, as well as the “No Kings Day” rallies held across the country have come into limelight.","Crowds on Demand CEO Adam Swart revealed that his organization declined an offer reportedly worth around $20 million to help organize a national protest.

‘Highly unlikely’: Is Donald Trump not firing Jerome Powell? President sends mixed signals amid speculation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/highly-unlikely-is-donald-trump-not-firing-jerome-powell-president-sends-mixed-signals-amid-speculation/articleshow/122607664.cms,"US President Donald Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell (AP images)





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that it is “highly unlikely” he will fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, after signaling otherwise a day earlier in a private meeting with lawmakers.Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump left the door open but downplayed the possibility. When asked if he had completely ruled out firing Powell, he replied that he never ruled anything out but it was “highly unlikely.” But he added an exception, saying, “Unless he has to leave for fraud.”Trump further added that he had discussed the idea of firing Powell with lawmakers and said most of them supported it. However, he dismissed reports claiming he had definite plans to remove Powell, calling them “not true.”His comments came after a meeting on Tuesday with Republican lawmakers, where he reportedly talked about firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. According to CNN, Trump asked the lawmakers what they thought about the idea, and some supported it. He even pointed to a paper that he said was a letter firing Powell.Trump's latest complaint focuses on a planned $2.5 billion renovation of the Federal Reserve’s headquarters.Speaking to reporters, Trump said: “I think he’s terrible… But the one thing I didn’t see him as a guy that needed a palace to live in.” He added that talking to Powell was like “talking to a chair” because of his lack of personality.Trump has long been frustrated with Powell, particularly for not cutting interest rates. He has criticised the cost of the planned renovations, saying: “But the one thing I would have never guessed is that he would be spending $2.5 billion to build a little extension onto the Fed.”Trump’s senior aides have also joined the criticism. Peter Navarro, a senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, called Powell one of the worst Fed chairs in history in a published opinion piece. Others have urged Congress to investigate Powell’s actions.Despite these developments, many have warned that removing the Federal Reserve chair could have serious consequences for the US economy. On Wednesday morning, the US dollar index fell by 0.8% following reports that the president was considering Powell’s dismissal. However, after Trump’s comments from the Oval Office, the index recovered slightly and was down only 0.3% by midday.Several Republican senators expressed concern about the idea. Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana warned that firing Powell could crash both the stock and bond markets.“If you fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve, you will see the stock market crash, and you will see the bond market crash,” Kennedy said.Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina said it would be a “colossal mistake,” arguing it would send a “shock wave” around the world about the central bank’s independence.Earlier, Bloomberg reported that President Trump had suggested Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent as a possible replacement for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. However, Trump indicated that Bessent is not a top candidate, citing his strong performance in his current role.","US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said that it is “highly unlikely” he will fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

Attorney Tony Buzbee blames mutual agreement for missing high-profile Las Vegas court appearance

Legal miscommunication or strategic legal posturing?

Public fallout and media retreat

The already controversial sexual assault lawsuit against NFL Hall of Famer and media personality Shannon Sharpe took another dramatic turn last week when the accuser’s legal team failed to appear at the initial court hearing in Las Vegas. The no-show left observers stunned and the presiding judge visibly disappointed—only for attorney Tony Buzbee to issue a statement days later that added more questions than clarity.“We are apologizing to the Court by letter for wasting the Court’s time,” Attorney Tony Buzbee told Pro Football Talk. “There was a mutual agreement among counsel to postpone the motion scheduled for July 9. As a result, there was no expectation by our team that her legal team would appear in person.”But the confusion only deepened when Judge Anna Albertson of the Clark County District Court reportedly “expressed disappointment” in court, per KLAS-TV, over Buzbee’s absence. Sharpe’s attorney, Robert DeMarco, did attend the hearing and requested a 45-day extension to review the case, which the judge approved. The next scheduled court date is now set for September 3.Legal analyst Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk questioned the optics of the incident, writing, “It’s odd that Sharpe’s lawyers would have shown up for the hearing, if the hearing had been postponed.It’s odd that, if/when the judge expressed disappointment… Sharpe’s lawyers wouldn’t have said that the lawyers had agreed to postpone the hearing.”This latest development comes just over two months after a $50 million lawsuit was filed against Sharpe, accusing him of assault, sexual assault, battery, and sexual battery stemming from an alleged incident that occurred when the plaintiff was 19. Sharpe has categorically denied the allegations, calling them an “egregious attempt at blackmail,” and has threatened to countersue.While Sharpe initially remained on ESPN’s First Take following the lawsuit, he has since stepped away from the program. His legal team responded to the accusations by releasing explicit text messages and publicly naming the accuser. In turn, the woman responded with voicemails in which Sharpe allegedly issued threats.As the case heads toward its next hearing, the courtroom confusion and increasingly personal nature of the public battle suggest that this will be one of the most closely watched legal dramas involving a sports figure in 2025.Also Read: Shannon Sharpe’s sexual assault lawsuit spirals into courtroom chaos after accuser appears without lawyer","Attorney Tony Buzbee blames mutual agreement for missing high-profile Las Vegas court appearance.

Meet the six key figures juggling multiple roles in the

Trump administration

:

Marco Rubio : Four hats and rising pressure



Sean Duffy: From roads to rockets



Douglas A. Collins: Veterans and beyond



Ed Martin: Multiple Justice Roles Without Confirmation



Jamieson Greer: Trade and ethics



Keith Sonderling: Labour meets Libraries



Criticism over governance







Several senior officials in US President Donald Trump’s administration are currently holding down more than one top-level role at a time, according to The New York Times.The MAGA supremo's team says this approach is efficient and cost-saving. However, critics warn it’s a recipe for poor management and conflict of interest. As Trump pushes to shrink government in his second term, overlapping appointments have become more common, sparking worries among watchdogs and governance experts alike.US secretary of state Marco Rubio is also serving as interim National Security Adviser, Acting Director of USAID, and Acting Archivist of the National Archives. Critics argue that the workload is overwhelming for a single person, particularly when the roles span such varied and critical domains. Rubio, known for his past presidential run and his time in the Senate, now finds himself managing both foreign diplomacy and national records.Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary, was chosen by Trump to head Nasa after the nomination of Jared Isaacman was withdrawn. Though his experience primarily lies in domestic infrastructure, Duffy has now been asked to lead the country’s space exploration programme.Critics question the match, noting that Nasa’s demands require deep scientific and technical understanding.Douglas A. Collins, the secretary of veterans affairs, has also taken on additional duties, particularly early in Trump’s second term. While his leadership at veterans affairs has focused on improving healthcare and services for former military personnel, NYT reports that he’s been consulted or involved in unrelated agency planning.Ed Martin was denied Senate confirmation as US Attorney for Washington, DC, but that hasn’t stopped the Trump administration from giving him substantial responsibilities. He currently holds three different positions within the Justice Department, none of which require Senate approval. Critics say the administration is avoiding usual rules by giving Martin powerful roles without proper public review.Jamieson Greer has been given the responsibility of serving both as the US Trade Representative and acting head of the Office of Government Ethics. The dual role has raised concerns due to the potential conflict between promoting national trade interests and overseeing ethical standards for federal employees. Greer, a known Trump loyalist, has been instrumental in pushing trade reforms and new tariffs.Keith Sonderling, who heads the Department of Labor, has also been appointed to lead the Institute of Museum and Library Services. The two roles have little in common, with one focused on labour policies and worker rights and the other on supporting public libraries and museums. Many experts have pointed out that managing these separate missions could dilute focus and hinder effectiveness.Experts have voiced strong concerns about this strategy. Max Stier of the Partnership for Public Service described it as “horrible management” that could lead to inefficiency. Pete Piraino, a former ATF agent, said departments like ATF and FEMA require full-time leadership. Others say dual roles could produce conflict of interest, especially when criminal prosecution overlaps with pardon processes or ethical oversight.The White House maintains that these overlapping appointments are cost-effective and ensure loyalty. “President Trump’s cabinet is second to none and has met the moment… harnessing its expertise,” said Harrison Fields, deputy press secretary. Yet critics worry the strategy may weaken governance and create unnecessary confusion within agencies designed to operate independently.",Several senior officials in US President Donald Trump’s administration are currently holding down more than one top-level role at a time.

Why has Imamoglu been handed another prison term?







The mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, was on Wednesday handed a prison sentence for insulting a prosecutor, according to Turkish state media.Imamoglu, the main political rival to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been in jail pending trial since March on separate corruption charges.He has now been sentenced to a year and eight months in prison for insulting and threatening Istanbul's chief prosecutor.Under Turkish law, prison terms of this length do not typically result in incarceration, but Imamoglu remains in pre-trial detention on other charges.The case stems from remarks Imamoglu made after a raid on the home of a youth leader from his opposition republican people's party (CHP), when he said Istanbul's chief prosecutor, Akin Gürlek, had a ""rotten"" mind.Imamoglu denies the charges against him and told broadcaster Halk TV and other Turkish media: ""I've been fighting against the abuse of the judiciary and against its use as a political tool. This is indeed an insult against our nation.""It's not the first time that Imamoglu has been convicted of insulting public officials.In 2022, he was sentenced to two years and six months in jail for criticizing election board officials over a decision to cancel the 2019 Istanbul elections in which he defeated the candidate from President Erdogan's ruling justice and development party (AKP).He has appealed that sentence but it has not yet been reviewed. If upheld, the conviction could prevent Imamoglu from participating in future elections.In March, Istanbul University annulled Imamoglu's university diploma, without which he cannot stand as a candidate for president.Since his arrest on March 19, Turkish opposition figures have come under increasing pressure, with dozens of CHP mayors dismissed or detained on allegations of corruption.The CHP denies corruption allegations and calls them a government attempt to remove electoral threats against Erdogan, a charge the government rejects.",Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu sentenced to a year and eight months in prison.

HAVANA: The Cuban government fired its labour minister after she was publicly rebuked by the president for saying Cuba’s beggars were all phonies in disguise. A brief announcement Tuesday evening said labour and social security minister Marta Elena Feito had demonstrated a lack of “objectivity and sensitivity on topics that are currently central to political and governmental policy”.The minister’s remarks on live television Monday were circulated on social media and became a lightning rod for popular frustration with years of economic crisis.“We have seen people who appear to be beggars, but when you look at their hands, when you look at the clothes they wear, they are disguised as beggars ...

TOKYO: An upstart party is gaining support ahead of elections in Japan by railing against a ‘silent invasion’ of immigrants, pushing the government to tackle fears about foreigners as it drags into the mainstream rhetoric once confined to the political fringe.Birthed on YouTube during the pandemic spreading conspiracy theories about vaccinations and a cabal of global elites, the party, Sanseito, is widening its appeal with a ‘Japanese First’ campaign ahead of Sunday’s upper house vote.And while polls show it may only secure 10 to 15 of the 125 seats up for grabs, it is further eroding the support of PM Shigeru Ishiba’s shaky minority government increasingly beholden to opposition parties as it clings to office. “In the past, anyone who brought up immigration would be attacked by the left. We are getting bashed too, but are also gaining support,” Sohei Kamiya, the party’s 47-year-old charismatic leader, said.“LDP and Komeito can’t stay silent if they want to keep their support,” Kamiya added, referring to Ishiba’s Liberal Democratic Partywhich has governed Japan for most of the past seven decades, and its junior partner.Kamiya’s message has grabbed voters frustrated with a weak economy and currency that has lured tourists in record numbers in recent years, further driving up prices that Japanese can ill-afford, analysts say.

SLUBICE (POLAND): The No 983 bus braked shortly after it crossed the Oder river from Poland into Germany, easing inside a large tent and stopping. German officers boarded, pulled off a man with gray hair and stuffed luggage for further inspection, then sent the driver on his way. The delay took about eight minutes. It was an example of a headache that has become routine for people crossing between the two countries as Germany makes a public show of cracking down on migration.Amid a voter backlash over the millions of asylum-seekers who entered the country over the past decade, German officials have thrown up checkpoints to search vehicles crossing their borders from all sides. Neighbouring countries have followed suit, including Austria and, starting last week, Poland.The checkpoints are beginning to undermine the ideal of free movement in European Union. In a series of agreements beginning 40 years ago, EU members effectively declared they would allow one another's citizens to cross without having to clear border security. But the pacts allow them to temporarily reimpose controls ""as a last resort"" in the event of a serious threat to security or public policy. Germany, Poland, Austria, France, Italy and the Netherlands have all cited immigration concerns when reinstating border checks this year.Enhanced checks have stopped 110 migrants per day on average from entering Germany since early May, when the new govt, under Friedrich Merz, tightened security procedures, interior ministry officials said. That's up from 83 per day in the first four months of the year. The checks are snarling traffic and annoying commuters, long-haul truckers and other travellers. They are squeezing, at least temporarily, the tendrils of commerce that have grown between towns like Frankfurt an der Oder, Germany, and Slubice, Poland, which lie on opposite banks of the Oder river.The additional security has spawned protests, often from citizens angry Germans are searching cars coming in from their countries. Dutch citizens acting as vigilantes have stopped cars on their way in from Germany to check them for migrants. In Poland, right-wing groups have vowed to turn back any migrant that Germany rejects at its border.""The policy shift has begun,"" the interior minister, Alexander Dobrindt, said last week, in which he claimed credit for plunging migration numbers. ""And it's working."" In the twin cities on the Oder river, many locals disagree. ""We do not have a migration crisis here,"" said Tomasz Stefanski, Slubice's deputy mayor. ""The idea of EU is really quite shaky at the moment, as is freedom of movement across borders.""","German officials have thrown up checkpoints to search vehicles crossing their borders from all sides.

Procedural or political?



Mace defends her vote







Just minutes after voting against a Democratic-led effort to release the long-awaited Jeffrey Epstein files, Congresswoman Nancy Mace took to social media with a bold statement: “All child r*pists should get the death penalty,” according to Axios, as noted by X community notes on her post.Her post has since drawn intense backlash, with critics accusing her and fellow Republicans of protecting abusers.Mace’s post came shortly after the House voted 211–210 to block a procedural move that would have triggered debate on forcing the justice department to release the Epstein documents within 30 days, according to the Clerk of the United States House of RepresentativesAll 211 votes against the motion came from Republicans. Just one Republican crossing over would have tipped the outcome.Although Mace is not on the House Rules Committee, she was among the 211 GOP members who voted against the move to bring the matter to the floor, leaving many on social media questioning her sincerity.Democrats had sought to advance the amendment, first introduced by Representative Ro Khanna, via a procedural manoeuvre. The attempt followed the Rules Committee’s decision to strike down the amendment the previous evening.Representative Mary Gay Scanlon introduced the motion on Tuesday to force a vote, but it failed narrowly.The measure would have forced the release of files related to the Epstein case, which is still a hot topic for both Republicans and Democrats, especially among supporters of US President Donald Trump. Many in the MAGA movement have long demanded more transparency about Epstein’s network and connections.Even outspoken Republican figures such as Marjorie Taylor Greene, who have previously voiced support for releasing the Epstein files, voted against the motion.In a follow-up post on X, Mace attempted to clarify her position, saying the vote in question was being misrepresented. “There was no vote on the Epstein files today... despite Democrats best efforts to trick the FAKE NEWS and YOU into thinking otherwise,” she wrote.She argued that the vote was simply a routine procedural action known as the “Previous Question” (PQ), not about Epstein or any specific issue. “If it fails, the minority takes over. In today’s GOP-led Congress, Democrats have no shot at defeating the PQ. So they played games – knowing it would fail – and then falsely claimed Republicans voted against releasing the Epstein files,” Mace posted.She continued, “Don’t fall for it. A TOTAL and COMPLETE LIE. This was a routine, party-line procedural vote. Nothing more. In fact, a PQ hasn’t failed since the 1980s.”However, another X Community Note said, “Misleading. GOP twice blocked efforts to get Epstein files released,” citing Politico.","Nancy Mace, a Republican in the US House of Representatives, voted against a Democratic-led effort to force the release of the long-awaited Jeffrey Epstein files.

Two suspects have been accused with helping Benjamin Hanil Song, a military veteran, avoid arrest after he tried to attack an ICE detention centre in Alvarado, Texas.John Phillip Thomas and Lynette Read Sharp are among 14 people accused in connection with the July 4 attack at the Prairieland Detention Centre. According to a criminal complaint, both are charged with hindering the arrest of Benjamin Hanil Song, the alleged gunman, as reported by Fox News.Authorities say Thomas and Sharp did not participate directly in the shooting but helped Song avoid capture afterward. Investigators allege they coordinated using encrypted Signal group chats to plan the attack and manage Song’s movements. The complaint states that on July 7, Sharp planned to transfer Song from Thomas to another unidentified person.Sharp reportedly withdrew from the July 4 plan shortly before the incident, citing ""family problems,"" but continued to monitor chats and offered financial help. Thomas allegedly ran the chat groups and picked up Song after the shooting.Due to evidence that they knew about Song’s intentions and actions, both are accused of hindering an attempted murderer’s apprehension. Their criminal complaint was signed on Monday evening.Thomas was arrested on July 10 and is being held on a $5 million bond for a charge of smuggling people. Sharp was arrested on July 13 and is being held on a $2.5 million bond for hindering the prosecution of terrorism.The main suspect, Benjamin Hanil Song, is charged with six felonies related to the ambush. He is accused of firing at two correctional officers and one Alvarado Police Department officer. One officer was shot in the neck and is expected to recover.Song reportedly hid in the woods near the detention centre after the attack before being picked up and helped by Thomas and Sharp. Following his identification, a Blue Alert was issued on July 9, and he was added to the FBI’s Most Wanted list.On Tuesday evening, the department of justice announced that Song had been captured in Dallas. Previously, the FBI had announced a $25,000 reward for information leading to Song’s arrest.","John Phillip Thomas and Lynette Read Sharp are among 14 people accused in connection with the July 4 attack at the Prairieland Detention Centre.

Powell’s resignation 'would be the right decision for America'







Florida Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna on Tuesday said that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s dismissal is imminent.The explosive claim comes amid mounting pressure from the Trump administration and ongoing speculation about a leadership change at one of the world’s most powerful central banks.The search for Powell’s replacement is now officially underway, according to US treasury secretary Scott Bessent. Bessent confirmed that “there’s a formal process that’s already starting” to find the next Federal Reserve chair, whose term expires in 2026.“There are a lot of good candidates inside and outside the Federal Reserve,"" he was quoted as saying to Bloomberg.Bessent also suggested that Powell should consider stepping down from the Fed entirely once his chairmanship ends to avoid confusion and maintain market stability.“Traditionally, the Fed chair also steps down as a governor,” Bessent said. “There’s been a lot of talk of a shadow Fed chair causing confusion in advance of his or her nomination. And I can tell you, I think it’d be very confusing for the market for a former Fed chair to stay on also,"" he added.However, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon appeared to push back against these ideas, stressing the importance of the Fed’s independence.After an earnings call, Dimon said, “I think the independence of the Fed is absolutely critical.” As reported by The Wall Street Journal, Dimon warned, “Playing around with the Fed can have adverse consequences, the absolute opposite of what you might be hoping for.”The Trump administration has been vocal in its desire for a Fed leader who favours lower interest rates and a more accommodative monetary policy. US President Donald Trump has publicly called for Powell to “resign immediately,” blaming him for not cutting interest rates aggressively enough and branding him “very bad for the country.” Trump argued, '“Every point [of interest] costs us $360 billion,” insisting rates should fall below 1%.Beyond verbal criticism, the White House, through Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, has accused Powell of “gross mismanagement” and extravagance over a $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed’s headquarters. Letters from the White House questioned the necessity and legality of the project, suggesting these concerns could be grounds for removal. Other officials, such as Bill Pulte, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, have publicly stated that Powell’s resignation “would be the right decision for America. ”Despite all this, Bessent emphasised that Trump has “numerous times” said he is not going to fire Powell. Powell himself has requested an inspector general review of the renovation project and reaffirmed his commitment to complete his term.As for who might succeed Powell, Bessent denied speculation about his own candidacy, saying he is “part of the decision-making process” but pointing out there are “a lot of good, strong candidates” both inside and outside the Federal Reserve.The Trump administration is reportedly aiming to announce a nominee as early as October or November.","US treasury secretary Scott Bessent says the search for Powell's replacement is now officially underway.

Republicans divide over document release



Trump links Epstein probe to broader grievances







A growing split is emerging in the Republican ranks as US President Donald Trump lashes out at some GOP allies, accusing them of succumbing to Democratic “propaganda” surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.The controversy began after Trump criticised lawmakers who want to release justice department files on Epstein, a pedophile who died by suicide in 2019 and has been at the centre of many conspiracy theories.In a post on Truth Social, Trump called these critics “weaklings” and said they had fallen “hook, line, and sinker” for a Democratic-orchestrated scam. He wrote: “Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this ‘bull***t’, hook, line, and sinker.” He added: “Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work … I don’t want their support anymore!”Trump argued that the focus on Epstein distracts from his achievements. “I have had more success in 6 months than perhaps any President in our Country’s history,” he wrote. “All these people want to talk about… is the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax.”Later, speaking from the Oval Office, Trump said that Attorney General Pam Bondi could release credible files but criticised “some stupid and foolish Republicans” for pushing too hard. He said: “They only want to talk about that ‘hoax’. Don’t give me their support.”The demand for transparency has gained traction in Congress. House Speaker Mike Johnson, alongside influence from former vice president Mike Pence and other Republicans such as Senators Anna Paulina Luna and Lauren Boebert, have urged the administration to publish the relevant documents.Pence told CBS News: “The time has come for the administration to release all of the files regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s investigation and prosecution. … Anyone who participated or was associated with this despicable man ought to be held up to public scrutiny.”In the House, Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie are pushing a discharge petition to compel a vote on releasing the files. This effort requires 218 signatures and is unlikely to proceed before Congress reconvenes in September.In a recent interview, Trump equated the Epstein investigation with other probes he views as politically motivated. “It’s all the same scam. They could look at this Jeffrey Epstein hoax also,” he said.He insisted the material only needed to be credible to be released. “In the case of Epstein, they’ve already looked at it and they are looking at it, and I think all they have to do is put out anything credible.”Trump aide and Attorney General Pam Bondi had said that there was no “client list” and also declined to comment on releasing additional files.

Her role in the Epstein and Maxwell prosecutions has drawn renewed attention amid a public dispute over unreleased Epstein files.

Critics suggest her firing is politically motivated, due to her family connection to former FBI director James Comey.

Legal experts and prosecutors warn the move undermines prosecutorial independence and risks politicising SDNY .

FAQ



Q. Was Maurene Comey fired because of her father, James Comey?

Q. Did the outcome of the Diddy trial contribute to her firing?

Q. Is this part of a wider purge?

Q. What happens to Epstein-related investigations now?

Q. Has the DOJ or White House issued a response?





Maurene Comey was an Assistant US Attorney in the Southern District of New York (SDNY), widely regarded as the most influential federal prosecutor's office in the country. She is the daughter of former FBI director James Comey, who was fired by Donald Trump in 2017.Comey built a reputation for managing high-profile cases involving sexual exploitation, public corruption, and white-collar crime. Her career highlights include:She was also a lead attorney in Epstein-related matters and represented the DOJ in civil litigation seeking to block disclosure of certain investigative records, citing risks of harassment to victims and witnesses.While the Justice Department has declined comment, several factors appear to have contributed to her abrupt removal:The mixed verdict in the Combs case reportedly sparked frustration in the Trump administration. Although Comey secured a conviction, the acquittals on major charges were viewed internally as a prosecutorial failure. Independent observers, however, noted the case’s legal complexity and the difficulty of securing trafficking convictions.Comey's firing came just days after renewed controversy over the Epstein investigation. President Trump has come under fire from supporters for refusing to release Epstein-related files.In response, he claimed without evidence that materials were “concocted” by his political enemies—including former President Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and James Comey.Although there is no direct link between the firing and Comey’s involvement in the Epstein-Maxwell cases, legal experts say the timing strongly suggests a political motive. As recently as 2024, Comey filed declarations defending DOJ's decision not to unseal Epstein records, arguing that doing so would harm potential retrials and risk victim harassment.Comey's firing is part of a broader shake-up of SDNY:Wednesday’s dismissal of Comey is the most high-profile removal to date. Colleagues say she was informed by letter citing Article II and held an impromptu meeting with the co-chief of the Public Corruption Unit to share the news. She was reportedly escorted out with quiet respect from fellow prosecutors.The removal of a veteran prosecutor without a clear explanation—and during ongoing litigation involving her past cases—has raised serious alarms across legal circles.There is no official confirmation, but Trump’s long-standing animus toward James Comey, combined with Maurene Comey’s role in politically sensitive prosecutions, suggests the name alone may have made her a target.Yes. While the prosecution secured one conviction, the acquittals on more serious charges were viewed unfavourably within the administration.Yes. Her dismissal follows a series of resignations and removals at SDNY, marking a consolidation of influence over one of the most powerful US Attorney’s offices.With Comey gone and DOJ signalling that no client list exists, further federal action appears unlikely. Her departure removes a key figure who had previously defended maintaining file secrecy.No. Both have declined to comment. Trump has said publicly that Epstein “was never a big factor” and described the controversy as a distraction created by “past supporters.”","Maurene Comey was an Assistant US Attorney in the Southern District of New York (SDNY) She is the daughter of former FBI director James Comey, who was fired by Donald Trump in 2017.

This is not about Epstein: Trump's former NSA General Flynn reacts to 'hoax' amid MAGA meltdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/this-is-not-about-epstein-trumps-former-nsa-general-flynn-reacts-to-hoax-amid-maga-meltdown/articleshow/122592404.cms,"Trump's former NSA writes open letter to President after he called Epstein case a hoax.

This is not about Epstein; this is about child abuse







Donald Trump's one of the closest and controversial allies, General Mike Flynn, who was his former National Security Adviser, penned an open letter on the Epstein row as Trump tore into his supporters, specifically old supporters, who are besotted by the Epstein conspiracy theories and are seeking the release of all documents. Trump said he does not need his old supporters as they fell for a Democrat scam. The rant came as his administration had been imploding over the Epstein issue after the Department of Justice and the FBI closed the case.While there is a DOJ versus FBI tussle going on, the MAGA base is up in arms seeking full disclosure of the client list, which the administration said does not exist.After Trump admonished MAGA, which turned into FAGA (fake MAGA), Mike Flynn uplifted the morale of the MAGA as he set the right question that needed to be asked. He said he hesitates to write the letter, but this is not a hoax, and this is not about who killed Epstein or whether he was killed.""This issue goes beyond all that. There are millions of Americans who overwhelmingly voted for you to be OUR President, and we want you to be massively successful. No one more than me. Personally, I still have a target on my forehead. I know that but, like you, I still fight,"" he wrote, adding that the issue is about the powers at play inside and outside of the government.""All we want at this stage is for a modicum of trust to be reestablished between our federal government and the people it is designed to serve. That’s all (PERIOD!),"" he wrote.General Flynn reminded Trump that Epstein was a convicted pedophile and had a list of clients. The issue is not about Epstein or the Left, it is about committing crime against American children.Addressing speculations that Epstein might have been a Mossad agent and that's why everything remains under the wraps, Flynn said the truth must come out.""Few know how many crystal balls you juggle on a daily basis (I do). And I know you cannot drop any of them,"" he wrote.","General Mike Flynn penned an open letter on the Epstein row as Trump tore into his supporters, specifically old supporters.

A Southern California couple has been charged with child endangerment and neglect after authorities removed more than 20 children from their Arcadia home, most of whom were reportedly born through surrogacy, police said.The children were between two months and 13 years old, with most falling in the one- to three-year-old age range, as per the Arcadia Police Department.Arrest warrants were issued in May for Guojun Xuan, 65 and his wife Silvia Zhang, 38, as well as their nanny Chunmei Li, 56.Xuan and Zhang were arrested without incident but Li is still at large, CBS News reported. Fifteen children were taken into protective custody by the Department of Children and Family Services while the others went to stay with friends of the couple or family members.It remains unclear whether the family intended to place the children in permanent homes elsewhere or raise them themselves. However, the mother reportedly said that she had always dreamed of having a very large family, as per investigators.Investigators believe that the surrogate mothers were located all across the country and were not aware that they were carrying embryos for the same couple.The police department said that officers were alerted of a possible child abuse case on May 7 by a local hospital.Upon arrival, they discovered that a two-month-old infant had been admitted with a traumatic head injury and intracranial bleeding.Detectives then raided the residence in Arcadia, where they collected surveillance camera footage, according to the department.""Upon reviewing the footage, detectives observed that a nanny employed by the child's parents violently shook and struck the infant on May 5, 2025, resulting in the child losing consciousness,"" said a police news release.Investigators said that even if the couple were aware of the child’s injury, they did not immediately seek medical help. They brought the infant to the hospital only after the baby suffered seizures two days later.Surveillance camera footage also found that other nannies employed by the couple were seen abusing the children.Neighbors said the sprawling 10,000-square-foot property, where the couple lived, valued at around $4 million, resembled a hotel, complete with a lobby and suite-style rooms across its nine bedrooms.""And (it has) like a round, what I can only describe as a hotel desk and a gentleman sitting behind it like a clerk,"" said Art Romero, who lives nearby.Zhang has denied the allegations saying that the officials are misguided and wrong. ""We look forward to vindicating any such claims at the appropriate time when and if any actions are brought,"" he said as reported by KTLA.""It's horrific, it's disturbing, it's damaging emotionally,"" said Kayla Elliot, one of the surrogate mothers of an infant, reported ABC7. She has launched a bid to get her baby back.","Gojun Xuan, 65 and his wife Silvia Zhang, 38, charged with child endangerment and neglect after authorities removed more than 20 children from their Arcadia home.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Monday it was creating a national paramilitary force, prompting concern among opposition parties and human rights groups that it could be used as a tool of political repression.The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force that will be called the Federal Constabulary, state minister for the interior Talal Chaudhry told a press conference in the eastern city of Faisalabad. Its new duties will include internal security, riot control and counter-terrorism, according to a copy of the amended law reported by the local Dunya News TV.The announcement came after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of former jailed PM Imran Khan said it would stage nationwide protests starting on Aug 5, the second anniversary of his arrest. Several such protests since his Aug 2023 arrest have turned violent, in some cases paralysing the capital Islamabad for days.“This will be a new force. This will be a stronger force. We need this force for internal security,” Chaudhry said, adding that President Asif Ali Zardari had already approved amendments in the law introducing changes in the paramilitary force.The new force replaces the Frontier Constabulary (FC), whose cadres were previously recruited only from tribes in the northwestern province, Chaudhry said.Training of the new force will bring it into line with other national law enforcement agencies, he added. Khan’s party spokesperson Zulfikar Bukhari said the changes should be subject to parliamentary discussion.The new force “should not be used as a gimmick to silence political opponents, as has been previously witnessed when the government applied such laws against a large number of the PTI leadership and supporters,” he said. His concern was echoed by Haris Khalique, secretary of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent body. “We are alarmed by the changes being made to the security and law enforcement structure of the country without any debate in parliament,” Khalique said.REUTERS","The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force.

Karachi blackout protest chokes city traffic: Punjab Colony residents block roads after 24-hour outage; report points to systemic collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/karachi-blackout-protest-chokes-city-traffic-punjab-colony-residents-block-roads-after-24-hour-outage-report-points-to-systemic-collapse/articleshow/122418234.cms,"



A protest over a prolonged power outage in Karachi’s Punjab Colony spiraled into city-wide traffic chaos on Saturday, underscoring what many see as chronic governance failure and energy mismanagement in Pakistan, Dawn reported.Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity. Power had reportedly been out since 11 am Friday, and despite repeated complaints, K-Electric, Karachi’s sole power distributor, allegedly failed to respond.The resulting sit-in crippled traffic on Defence Road and nearby areas. Long queues of trucks and tankers vital to Karachi Port were stalled from Qayyumabad to the KPT Flyover. Major intersections like Boat Basin, Gizri, and Hino Chowrangi were brought to a standstill, leaving thousands of commuters stranded, according to Dawn.The outage reportedly followed K-Electric’s anti-theft operation in the adjacent P&T Colony. Protesters claimed legal connections were also cut off in the sweep, with no clear procedure followed. KE, however, described the protestors as ""miscreants"" attempting to restore illegal connections and said their teams were attacked during the operation, allegedly linked to a cable TV network.No evidence was provided implicating all affected residents in theft.While KE later claimed to have restored power to parts of the area, the larger issue remains unresolved. The incident highlights Pakistan’s ongoing struggle to provide reliable electricity, exacerbated by outdated infrastructure and lack of accountability in power distribution.As Dawn noted, the crisis is less about one blackout and more a reflection of systemic dysfunction, where citizens bear the brunt of institutional failure.","Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity.
