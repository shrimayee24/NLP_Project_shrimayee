'Continued gender harassment & intimidation': Mahua Moitra accuses Kiren Rijiju of 'openly threatening' her in Lok Sabha,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mahua-moitra-writes-to-ipu-against-union-minister-kiren-rijiju-over-his-remarks-in-lok-sabha/articleshow/116305063.cms,"NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress Lok Sabha MP Mahua Moitra on Friday said that she has written to Inter-Parliamentary Union , accusing Parliamentary Affairs minister Kiren Rijuju of threatening her in the Lok Sabha.She also said that despite Speaker Om Birla indicated he would remove Rijiju's remarks from the record, no action has been taken thus far.""So Kiren Rijiju openly threatens me in Lok Sabha today in complete violation of parliamentary rules & procedure. @ombirlakota says he will get Rijiju’s words deleted but no action yet. Written to Inter-Parliamentary Union against this continued gender harassment & intimidation yet again,"" she posted on X.The incident happened between them during a debate on 75 years of the Indian Constitution, where Moitra's comments regarding judge B H Loya's death sparked controversy in the Lok Sabha.“Honourable Defence Minister in a speech this ,morning mentioned the courage of the late justice HR Khanna to dissent in 1976. May I remind everyone, Justice HR Khanna lived for 32 years after 1976 under a largely Congress regime. Long enough to write his autobiography which the minister quoted from. Unlike poor Justice Loya, who is resting in peace long before his time,” Moitra said.Rijiju responded by stating she had raised a matter already settled by the Supreme Court and indicated about potential parliamentary consequences.""We will take appropriate parliamentary action. You cannot escape. You are setting a very wrong precedent,"" said Rijuju.The session was then adjourned briefly for two times, resuming only after Speaker Om Birla requested Moitra to verify her statements. He also addressed opposition concerns regarding Rijiju's stern words towards a female parliamentarian.BJP's Nishikant Dubey also raised objections following Moitra's address. Rijiju called Moitra's comments as concerning, warning that such behaviour could set an unwanted precedent.Following the adjournments, TMC's Saugata Roy and Congress's K C Venugopal objected to Rijiju's language, highlighting that the Speaker holds authority in the Lok Sabha. They suggested proper parliamentary procedures should have been followed if there were concerns about Moitra's speech.Venugopal addressed Birla and said that while the minister should maintain order, he instead intimidated a female member. He requested either an apology or removal of Rijiju's remarks.","Mahua Moitra accuses Parliamentary Affairs minister Kiren Rijijuju of threatening her in the Lok Sabha.

Telangana's Congress govt indulging in publicity stunt to deflect blame for stampede: Centre,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/telanganas-congress-govt-indulging-in-publicity-stunt-to-deflect-blame-for-stampede-centre/articleshow/116301642.cms,"(File photo)

HYDERABAD: The Centre slammed Allu Arjun's arrest on Friday saying the Congress govt in Telangana was ""indulging in publicity stunts "" by arresting the national award-winning actor to deflect the blame for the stampede outside Sandhya Theatre on Dec 4 which claimed the life of a woman. However, CM A Revanth Reddy justified the action saying there are no separate laws for film stars and politicians.Backing the actor, Union I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the stampede was a clear case of poor arrangements by the state and local administration. ""Congress has no respect for the creative industry and the arrest of Allu Arjun proves it yet again,"" he said on X, adding that Telangana govt should assist those affected by the stampede and punish those making the arrangements on Dec 4 ""instead of continuously attacking film personalities"".Talking to media, the CM stressed that the law was equal for all, recalling that even Bollywood stars like Sanjay Dutt and Salman Khan were arrested in various cases. ""Who is responsible for the death of the woman in the stampede? The film was made with huge investment by the producers to make money and not for any social cause,"" Revanth said.Admitting that his govt had given permission for the show on Dec 4, the CM said: ""Had the film hero come in a car and watched the movie silently, there would have been no issue. But he came out of his car and waved to the crowds. Police and security could not control the crowds, which led to the unfortunate incident . That's why the film hero was booked."" The CM said police followed the due procedure in booking and arresting Allu Arjun, going to his house nine days after the stampede.Revanth said he was monitoring the developments after the stampede. ""If the film hero was not booked, people would be asking govt why there is special treatment for Allu Arjun,"" he said, adding that he knew the actor very well and his father-in-law Chandrasekhar Reddy is a Congress neta who is also his relative. Allu Arjun's uncle, mega star Chiranjeevi, is also a Congress leader, the CM added.","Congress govt in Telangana was ""indulging in publicity stunts "" by arresting Allu Arjun to deflect the blame for the stampede outside Sandhya Theatre on Dec 4.

Actor's arrest unwarranted, says family who filed plaint

HYDERABAD: Actor Allu Arjun was arrested Friday from his home in Hyderabad's Jubilee Hills and charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder for the death of a 39-year-old mother of two in the Dec 4 stampede at a city theatre hosting the premiere of his new film, Pushpa 2: The Rule , a blockbuster.Telangana high court granted Arjun interim bail till Jan 21 on a bond of Rs 50,000 after a local court remanded him in judicial custody for 14 days. Justice J Sridevi said it was ""unfair"" to hold the actor to account for the stampede when the film's distributors had intimated cops about his presence at the premiere.However, Chanchalguda jail authorities told TOI that the actor would not be released in the night. Amid protests by fans outside, a jail official said Arjun would be released Saturday morning as the bail order had arrived late.The family of Revathi, who died in the stampede, said Arjun was not to blame and they were ready to withdraw the complaint that led police to register a criminal case.Allu Arjun couldn't be legally held responsible for the December 4 stampede at Sandhya Theatre, in which a woman was killed, as police had been duly informed about his presence at the premiere and should have taken adequate precaution, the actor's counsels argued in a packed courtroom in Nampally on Friday.DCP (central zone) Akshansh Yadav had denied on the morning after the stampede that they received an intimation from the theatre on Dec 2. On Dec 8, ACP (Chikadpally division) L Ramesh Kumar iterated that there was ""no prior information "" about Allu Arjun being invited to the theatre.The public prosecutor sought Allu Arjun's judicial remand on the ground that despite police turning down Sandhya Theatre's request, the actor and his entourage turned up, leading to what he said was ""an uncontrollable situation"". Police also accused Allu Arjun of arriving at the theatre in a cavalcade for which there was no prior permission. ""Waving to the people from the open-top car got the crowd excited, with more people joining in and rushing into the theatre,"" the prosecutor said.The prosecution took a similar line during arguments at HC hearing of Allu Arjun's interim bail plea. Prosecutor Palle Nageswara Rao argued against any relief to the actor and requested that he be asked to file for regular bail on Dec 16.Justice J Sridevi ruled that none of the charges - negligent act leading to death and prior knowledge about the likelihood of such a death, among others - was applicable in this case as police could not present proof of having rejected the theatre's bandobast request.Allu Arjun's counsel Niranjan Reddy cited a Gujarat HC order granting ""instant relief"" to Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan when he was charged with causing a person's death in a stampede during a publicity event for his 2017 film Raees.Justice Sridevi also granted interim bail to the four co-owners of Sandhya Theatre. She asked police to continue their investigation and directed the actor to cooperate with them.The criminal case was filed against the actor, his security team and the management of Sandhya Theatre on the basis of a complaint filed by the family of the victim, Revathi. But the family said the actor's arrest was unwarranted. ""My son wanted to watch 'Pushpa 2', so I took them to the theatre. Allu Arjun was not at fault. I came to know about his arrest from a news portal,"" Revathi's husband Mogadampalli Bhaskar said. Revathi was with her nine-year-old son Sritej when police tried to disperse the swelling premiere-evening crowd jostling for a glimpse of the actor. The boy, a fan of Arjun, was seriously injured in the resultant stampede.The day of drama began around 11.30am when police arrested Allu Arjun from his Jubilee Hills residence. He was taken to Chikadpally police station, by which time hundreds of fans had assembled there. The actor's father, Allu Arvind, a film producer, and other family members trailed the police convoy.The actor waved to his fans and smiled while being taken to Gandhi Hospital later for a medical examination. At 3.30pm, Allu Arjun was produced before the ninth additional chief metropolitan magistrate at Nampally criminal court.The HC relief came moments after Allu Arjun entered Chanchalguda Central Jail, clad in a white hoodie with the film's dialogue, ""flower nahi, fire hei mein"", emblazoned on it. Late Friday, city police said, ""It is beyond our resources to provide bandobast for every event. In specific cases where a heavy crowd is expected or some popular personality is visiting, the organiser personally visits the police station/ACP/DCP office and briefs about the programme, depending upon which we provide the bandobast.""","Actor Allu Arjun was arrested Friday from his home in Hyderabad's Jubilee Hills.

BHOPAL: Suicides by a businessman and his wife - Manoj and Neha Parmar - on Friday in Ashta town of MP and a six-page typed purported suicide note recovered from their home, alleging harassment and physical torture by ED officials during a search at his premises on December 5, have taken a political turn.Congress alleged Parmar was harassed as his kids supported Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra by organising a 'Gullak' (piggy bank) team.ED sources termed the deaths ""unfortunate"" and denied the charge, emphasising that the search was conducted in the presence of two independent officers (one male and the other female) of SBI. A dossier prepared by ED on Parmar termed him a ""habitual offender"" who was sentenced to seven years in jail for loan fraud in another case investigated by Astha police. Parmar was arrested and was on bail in a rape case in which the trial is underway, and faced offences of creating public nuisance, threatening public servants and damaging public property.In his suicide note - marked to PM, CJI, CM, Governor, DGP and AICC and MPCC - the Manoj alleged that his entire family was being victimised because of his association with Congress. The note ends with a prayer to Rahul Gandhi to take care of his three children.Denying the allegations, agency sources said that Parmar had personally called ED office at 12 noon on Dec 12, confirming that he would appear for recording his statement at 3.30pm. However, he didn't turn up.ED had searched four of Parmar's properties in Indore and Sehore as part of a probe into alleged money laundering linked to a 2017 FIR by CBI.Sources stressed that MP high court had in 2022 rejected Parmar's plea for quashing the CBI FIR. The HC had noted that while CBI registered a single FIR for the 18 transactions, each was considered a distinct offence, and the agency was instructed to proceed with the case.","Congress alleged Parmar was harassed as his kids supported Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra by organising a 'Gullak' (piggy bank) team.

'Allu Arjun not to blame', says husband of stampede victim



NEW DELHI: Telugu actor Allu Arjun was arrested on Friday, in connection with a stampede that occurred during the premiere of his film Pushpa 2: The Rule at Sandhya Theatre, Hyderabad. The December 4 incident led to the death of Revathi, a 39-year-old woman, and injuries to her son. Allegations of poor crowd management and negligence have since surfaced, with the actor and others facing legal action.Allu Arjun filed a petition in the Telangana high court to quash the FIR and sought a stay on all legal proceedings.Authorities criticised the theatre management for failing to make additional provisions for crowd control. “The theatre management did not make any additional provisions regarding security...though the theatre management had information about their arrival,” the police stated.The police have registered a case under sections 105 (Culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 118(1) (Voluntarily causing hurt) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) at the Chikkadpally police station based on the complaint lodged by the deceased woman's family.Besides Allu Arjun, his security team and the management of the theatre are also named. The case was registered at Chikkadpally Police Station on December 5 on a complaint by the woman's husband.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central Zone) Akshansh Yadav provided a detailed account of the tragic events at the premiere of Pushpa 2: The Rule on December 13, 2024. The show was scheduled at Sandhya 70mm Theatre in Chikkadpally RTC X Road at 9:40 PM.A massive crowd had gathered to watch the movie and catch a glimpse of actor Allu Arjun, who was anticipated to visit. The theatre management, despite being aware of the actor's arrival, failed to notify the authorities or make necessary security arrangements, including a separate entry or exit for the actor and his team. Around 9:30 PM, Allu Arjun arrived at the venue with his personal security team. The crowd surged towards him, trying to enter the theatre. According to the DCP: ""His personal security team started pushing the public which further aggravated the situation as there was already a huge gathering at the theatre.""The commotion led to overcrowding in the lower balcony area. Among the victims was 35-year-old Revathi and her 13-year-old son Sri Tej, who were suffocated due to the influx of people. Police personnel on duty rescued them and performed CPR on the boy.They were immediately rushed to Durgabai Deshmukh Hospital, where doctors pronounced Revathi dead. Her son was transferred to another hospital for advanced treatment.Telangana high court granted 4 weeks interim bail to actor Allu Arjun after he was sent to 14-day judicial custody by a local court in connection with a stampede incident on Friday. The matter will come up for hearing again on January 21, 2025. The HC said that ""right to life and liberty can't be taken away just because he is an actor"", adding that it is ""apparent that there is no malafide action associated to the petitioner"".The husband of the woman who was killed in a stampede on Friday said he does not hold actor Allu Arjun responsible for the incident and is prepared to withdraw his complaint.Bhaskar clarified his stance in a statement, expressing that he does not hold Allu Arjun responsible for the tragic event. ""We only visited Sandhya Theatre because my son was eager to watch the movie. Allu Arjun is not to blame for being at the theatre that day. I am ready to withdraw my complaint. I wasn’t even informed about his arrest; I learned about it from the news while at the hospital. He has no connection to the stampede,"" Bhaskar said.","Telugu actor Allu Arjun was arrested on Friday, in connection with a stampede that occurred during the premiere of his film Pushpa 2: The Rule at Sandhya Theatre, Hyderabad.

NEW DELHI: Telangana Police on Friday explicitly blamed actor Allu Arjun 's ""gesture"" for the crowd getting out of control and leading to a stampede in Hyderabad's Sandhya Theatre during the premiere of Pushpa 2 that resulted in the death of a woman and serious injuries to her son.The stampede, which occurred on December 4, claimed the life of Revathi and critically injured her 13-year-old son, Shreethej, after a massive crowd gathered at Sandhya Theatre in Hyderabad.Facing backlash for the actor's arrest, who was granted interim bail by the Telangana high court, the state police issued a release in which it dismissed allegations there weren't sufficient arrangements in place to manage the large crowd that had gathered.The Telangana police said that organisers, unlike what usually happens before any mega event, ""did not meet any officer and simply submitted the letter in the inward section"".The administration said when a heavy crowd is expected the organisers ""personally visit the police station/ ACP/ DCP office"" to seek the proper arrangement, which was not the case with Allu Arjun's event.""We receive a lot of requests for(arrangement) citing visits by some political personalities, film celebrities , religious programs etc., However, it is beyond our resources to providefor every event. In specific cases where heavy crowd is expected or some popular personality is visiting, the organizer personally visits the police station / ACP / DCP office and brief about the program depending upon which we provide the bandobust. In this case, the organiser did not meet any officer and simply submitted the letter in the inward section. No details were made available to the police despite this we arranged suitablefor crowd management outside the theatre, "" deputy commissioner of police , Central Zone, Hyderabad City said while clarifying on the letter being circulating in media addressed by Sandhya Cine Enterprise 70 MM to ACP Chikkadpally requestingon 04/05-12-2024 in connection with the release of Pushpa-2 .The police said that the ""crowd was well in control"" before the Pushpa 2 actor ""came out from the sun roof of his vehicle and started waving to the public gathered"".""This gesture attracted a lot of public towards the theatre main gate. At the same time his private security started pushing people to make way for his vehicle. His team was intimated to take him back citing large public gathering but they didn’t act on it and Allu Arjun was there inside the theatre for more than two hours. Therefore, it is clear that adequate policewas in place, it was his actions which led to this unfortunate incident,"" the Telangana police said.The police also refuted that they misbehaved with the actor and claimed they gave ""enough time to to Allu Arjun to ""interact with his family and wife"" before he himself came out and entered the police vehicle.""Another issue that the police personnel misbehaved with Allu Arjun at the time of arrest is also not true. When police reached his residence, he requested some time to change his clothes. He went inside his bedroom, police personnel waited outside and took him into custody when he came out,"" deputy commissioner of police, Central Zone, Hyderabad City added.","Telangana Police explicitly blamed actor Allu Arjun's ""gesture"" for the crowd getting out of control and leading to a stampede.

"Family, aides, and soldiers abandoned: Assad’s solo escape to Moscow",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/syria-civil-war-family-aides-and-soldiers-abandoned-bashar-al-assads-solo-escape-to-moscow/articleshow/116292821.cms,"Bashar al-Assad maintained strict secrecy about his plans to leave Syria during his regime's downfall. According to more than a dozen informed sources who spoke to Reuters, he deliberately misled or withheld information from his aides, officials and family members.On Saturday, at a defence ministry gathering of approximately 30 army and security leaders, Assad gave false assurances about incoming Russian military support and urged the ground forces to maintain their positions, according to an anonymous commander who attended the briefing.The civilian personnel remained unaware of the situation. Assad deceived his presidential office manager by saying he was heading home after work on Saturday, when he actually proceeded to the airport, according to an insider aide.He also requested his media adviser, Buthaina Shaaban, to visit his residence to compose a speech, but upon her arrival, she found the premises empty. ""Assad didn't even make a last stand. He didn't even rally his own troops,"" said Nadim Houri, executive director of the Arab Reform Initiative regional think-tank. ""He let his supporters face their own fate.""Discussions with 14 individuals familiar with his final period in power reveal a leader seeking external assistance to maintain his 24-year rule before orchestrating a covert departure from Syria early Sunday.The sources, including former presidential inner circle members, regional diplomats, security officials and senior Iranian representatives, requested anonymity to discuss sensitive information freely.Assad excluded even his younger brother, Maher, the Army's 4th armoured division commander, from his escape plans. According to three aides, Maher subsequently travelled to Russia via Iraq by helicopter.His maternal cousins, Ehab and Eyad Makhlouf, were left behind as Damascus fell. According to a Syrian aide and Lebanese security official, they attempted to escape to Lebanon by car but encountered rebels. Ehab was killed and Eyad wounded in the ambush. The incident lacks official confirmation.On December 8, Assad departed Damascus by aircraft, flying with the transponder disabled, according to two regional diplomats. His departure concluded his 24-year leadership, his family's 50-year rule, and effectively ended the 13-year civil war. He travelled to Russia's Hmeimim airbase in Latakia, then proceeded to Moscow.His immediate family - wife Asma and their three children - were already in Moscow, according to three former close aides and a senior regional official.Social media footage of Assad's residence, captured by rebels and citizens who entered the presidential complex after his departure, suggests a rushed exit, showing unfinished meals on the stove and abandoned personal items, including family photographs.Russia's military assistance would not be forthcoming, despite their crucial 2015 intervention that had previously supported Assad's position in the civil war. Similarly, Iran, another steadfast supporter, would not provide military aid.Assad received this news during his attempts to secure support from various sources whilst trying to maintain his grip on power and ensure his safety, according to individuals who spoke with Reuters.On November 28, Assad travelled to Moscow, following Syrian rebel attacks in Aleppo province and their swift advance across the nation. Three regional diplomats reported that his requests for military support were rejected by the Kremlin.According to Hadi al-Bahra, who leads Syria's main opposition abroad, Assad misrepresented the Moscow meeting's outcome to his staff, based on information from an insider within Assad's circle and a regional official.""He told his commanders and associates after his Moscow trip that military support was coming,"" Bahra added. ""He was lying to them. The message he received from Moscow was negative.""On Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov informed reporters that whilst Russia had previously invested significant effort in stabilising Syria, its current focus was the Ukraine conflict.On December 2, four days after the Moscow visit, Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araqchi met Assad in Damascus. By then, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) Islamist rebels had captured Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city, and were advancing southward as government forces weakened.A senior Iranian diplomat told Reuters that Assad appeared distressed during the meeting and acknowledged his army's inability to mount effective resistance.Two senior Iranian officials said that Assad never requested Iranian troops in Syria, recognising that Israel might use such deployment to justify attacks on Iranian forces in Syria or Iran itself.The Kremlin and Russian foreign ministry declined to comment on this matter, whilst the Iranian foreign ministry was not immediately available for response.","Bashar al-Assad deliberately misled or withheld information from his aides, officials and family members. He excluded even his younger brother, Maher, the Army's 4th armoured division commander, from his escape plans. His departure concluded his 24-year leadership, his family's 50-year rule, and effectively ended the 13-year civil war.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116292856,imgsize-1068098,width-400,resizemode-4/116292856.jpg"

The actor has since pledged Rs 25 lakh in financial support to Revathi’s family and committed to covering the medical expenses for Shreethej.The stampede at the Pushpa 2 premiere was caused by an overwhelming crowd eager to see the actor, with the situation escalating further due to a lack of proper security arrangements.","Revathi Bhaskar's husband says he does not hold actor Allu Arjun responsible for the incident.

Was Guilfoyle fired from Fox over sexual harassment?

Timeline of Guilfoyle's relationship with Don Jr



Just ahead of the election, Kimberly Guilfoyle floated an old story from her career days that involved Kamala Harris. As Guilfoyle continued to fire salvos at Harris, she recounted her personal story that Kamala Haris once stopped her from getting a job in the San Francisco district attorney's office. This happened over 20 years ago but Guilfoyle's grudge did not become blunt though Guilfoyle ultimately got the job.55-year-old Guilfoyle is almost a contemporary of Harris and their field being the same Guilfoyle's personal story added fire to Donald Trump's campaign against Harris. Guilfoyle did not continue that job for long as she got married to Democrat Gavin Newson in 2001 who was then the mayor of San Francisco. They split in 2006 when Guilfoyle got married to businessman Eric Villency. They broke up in 2009. At that time, Guilfoyle was working with the Fox News.Guilfoyle left Fox in 2018 and joined America First Policies, a Trump super PAC to campaign for Republicans in the 2018 midterm elections. But at that time she was already dating Donald Trump Jr . And according to reports, she was fired from Fox over a sexual harassment accusation from a female assistant. Reports said Fox had been in the middle of a year-long investigation into the allegation when she left.The allegation against her was that she called her assistant to her apartment and ""displayed herself naked"", and showed her photographs of the genitalia of men she'd had sexual relations with. The allegation resulted in Foc News agreeing to a $4 million dollar out-of-court settlement, reports said. Guilfoyle denied any wrongdoing. On her part, the reason for leaving Fox News was a conflict of interest as she was dating Don Jr.Guilfoyle and Don Jr have been together since 2018 and they got engaged in 2020. The relationship launched Guilfoyle as a MAGA voice that matters as she was seen at all Trump events, delivering speeches at Republican National Conventions.On several occasions and as recent as in September, Guilfoyle referred to Donald Trump as 'father-in-law' in a public speech. But that was the last time, she called Donald Trump father-in-law in public as it was in the same month that Don Jr was first spotted canoodling with Bettina Anderson, a Palm Beach socialite leading to rumors of a breakup between Don Jr and Guilfoyle.But on election night, Guilfoyle and Don Jr were seen together side by side -- Bettina was also there.Don Jr and Guilfoyle were not seen together since November 12 and on December 9, Don Jr was seen celebrating Bettina's birthday and then Donald Trump announced Guilfoyle as the Greece ambassador.","Kimberly Guilfoyle floated an old story from her career days that involved Kamala Harris.

NEW DELHI: An FIR has been registered against four people in connection with the suicide of 34-year-old Bengaluru techie Atul Subhash, who accused his wife, her relatives and a judge of harassment, extortion and corruption before his death.Based on a complaint by Atul's brother Bikas Kumar at the Marathahalli police station in Bengaluru, the FIR includes charges under section 108 and section 3(5) of the BNS. The accused are Nikita Singhania (wife), Nisha Singhania (mother-in-law), Anurag Singhania (brother-in-law) and Sushil Singhania (wife's uncle).Subhash, employed at a private company, left a detailed 24-page note describing years of emotional distress from marital problems. In his suicide note, he accused a family court judge in Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh, of dismissing his pleas and alleged that a court officer accepted bribes openly.""I want my brother to get justice. I want this country to have a legal process through which even men can get justice. I want strict action against those who are sitting on a legal chair and doing corruption because if this continues then how will people expect justice,"" his brother Bikas told PTI.Bikas expressed concerns about systemic corruption, noting that justice requires an unbiased system where all parties receive fair hearings based on facts.""....can expect justice only when decisions are made on the basis of facts and if it does not happen, then people will slowly start losing faith in judicial system. It may lead to a situation where people may get afraid to get married. Men may start feeling that if they get married, they will just end up being an ATM machine for vending money,"" he said.Authorities found Subhash's body at his Manjunath Layout residence on Monday, with a placard stating ""Justice is due.""He recorded an 80-minute video on Rumble explaining his decision, which subsequently went viral.""I feel that I should kill myself because the money I earn is making my enemies stronger. That same money will be used to destroy me, and this cycle will keep going,"" Subhash stated in the video.His uncle, Pawan Kumar, alleged harassment over financial demands, stating the family initially requested Rs 40,000 monthly, which increased to Rs 1 lakh.""His wife even said that he should commit suicide if he cannot pay the amount to which the judge also laughed. This really hurt him,"" PTI quoted Kumar as saying.Sushil Kumar, Nikita's uncle, denied involvement, stating, ""I came to know that I am also named in the FIR. I am innocent. I wasn't even there. We got to know about his suicide through media. None of our family members were present at the scene of incident. There's a case going on in the court for the last three years and in this duration, we did not have any communication with him or his family. We are not at fault. Case is going on... Court will decide and give the verdict.""Police investigations revealed ongoing marital disputes and a case filed against Subhash in Uttar Pradesh. Before his death, he distributed his note via email and shared it with an NGO WhatsApp group. The death note reportedly mentions that Subhash got married in 2019 and that the couple had a son the following year.""In July, the family court at Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh directed Atul to pay a monthly maintenance of Rs 40,000 towards his son. The court did not ask Atul to compensate his wife since she was earning decently in Delhi. Atul was earning a monthly salary of Rs 84,000. Perhaps, Atul might have thought Rs 40,000 was a little expensive for him. But he could have appealed in higher courts, including high court, against the orders.

A bizarre escape attempt featuring a man fleeing police in Fall River, Massachusetts, who took inspiration from Santa Claus—but his criminal take on chimney diving didn’t go as planned.According to Fall River Police , Robert Langlais , 33, tried to evade arrest by scaling a rooftop and diving into a chimney, only to find himself firmly stuck. “Langlais invoked the essence of the seasonal icon and attempted to hide inside of a chimney,” the police stated. His peculiar choice of escape earned him the nickname “Ghetto Santa” as he awaited rescue from the very officers he was fleeing.The drama began when detectives from the Community Action & Suppression Team (CAST) executed the warrant. Langlais and another male attempted to escape via the rooftop. While the second individual leapt to freedom onto a parked vehicle, Langlais’ getaway ended in the narrow confines of the chimney. Unable to free him, detectives called the Fall River Fire Department and Emergency Medical Services for assistance.Police bodycam footage, shared on social media, captured the rescue effort. In the clip, officers are heard locating Langlais and remarking, “You’re an idiot,” upon discovering his unconventional hiding spot. The video, lasting 3 minutes and 40 seconds, shows firefighters carefully extracting the suspect from the chimney.After being freed, Langlais was transported to a local hospital as a precaution before being medically cleared and formally arrested. He faces charges of possession of Class A and Class B drugs alongside a series of outstanding warrants.A second individual, 32-year-old Tanisha Ibay, was also arrested at the residence for drug possession, though her arrest lacked the theatrics of her accomplice’s rooftop escapade.","Robert Langlais, 33, tried to evade arrest by scaling a rooftop and diving into a chimney, only to find himself firmly stuck.

The pair were spotted holding hands and kissing at a birthday dinner in Palm Beach on Tuesday, and the following evening, they appeared together atMar-a-Lago , where they mingled with the exclusive crowd and were even greeted by Donald Trump.Sources close to the couple have described their chemistry, with one insider noting, “They are clearly in love.” However, despite their visible closeness, they kept a low profile at the event, maintaining discretion as they enjoyed the evening in the club's VIP area.While the details of Don Jr. and Guilfoyle’s breakup remain private, it’s clear that, despite parting ways personally, they maintain a strong professional and personal connection.","The couple, who started dating in 2018 and got engaged in 2020, has reportedly parted ways, though Don Jr did not explicitly confirm the split in his statement.

How Donald Trump sent his son's 'ex-fiancée' Kimberly Guilfoyle to Greece as Bettina Anderson sparks love triangle gossip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-donald-trump-sent-his-sons-ex-fiance-kimberly-guilfoyle-to-greece-as-bettina-anderson-sparks-love-triangle-gossip/articleshow/116203694.cms,"Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle

US President-elect Donald Trump made a flurry of job announcements on Wednesday, including the selection of Kimberly Guilfoyle as ambassador to Greece . However, the timing of this appointment was anything but ordinary, coming amid a storm of tabloid gossip surrounding his son Donald Trump Jr 's relationship status.Guilfoyle, who had been dating Trump Jr since 2018 and got engaged to him in 2020, found herself in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. The day earlier, British tabloid The Daily Mail published photos of Trump Jr with socialite Bettina Anderson , igniting rumors that he had moved on with a new love interest.The outlet described the images as ""incontrovertible proof"" that Trump Jr had ""moved on"" with the ""stunning 'it girl.'""And so, as his son’s rumored new romance heated up, Donald Trump reportedly sent his son’s 'ex-fiancée' to Greece. The timing of Guilfoyle’s appointment as ambassador could hardly be more dramatic, adding layers to the gossip surrounding the love triangle.Despite the swirling rumors, Guilfoyle’s appointment was met with a glowing endorsement from Trump, who called her ""a close friend and ally"" with “extensive experience and leadership.” However, his Truth Social post made no mention of her relationship with his son, nor did it address the tabloid storm brewing around her and Trump Jr’s alleged breakup.The whispers about the love triangle have been brewing for months.As per the report by NYT, in July, Anderson raised eyebrows at the Republican National Convention , where she sat conspicuously close to Trump Jr and Guilfoyle, clad in a striking red dress. And just last September, reports surfaced of Trump Jr and Anderson sharing a kiss during brunch — adding fuel to the speculation, especially since Anderson was once friends with Trump Jr’s ex-wife, Vanessa Trump.Further intrigue followed when Guilfoyle was notably absent from a postelection family photo, which featured Vanessa, her five children with Trump Jr, and even Elon Musk. The missing fiancée fueled chatter about the couple’s relationship status.Meanwhile, Anderson stirred the pot this week with an Instagram post showcasing a lavish bouquet and a note reading, ""Many have said that you're aging out but I think you're perfect."" Her caption? ""Tough but fair."" Observers were quick to spot Trump Jr's Instagram handle tagged in the post.Anderson, who hails from a prominent Palm Beach family and leads a conservation nonprofit, poked fun at her public image, describing herself online as a “typical stay-at-home mom” who “doesn’t do household chores … or have a husband … or have kids,” reported NYT.When asked about the love triangle rumors , a spokesperson for President-elect Trump dismissed them as “very sexist,” emphasizing that Guilfoyle’s selection was based on her qualifications.Guilfoyle herself shared her excitement about the role, saying she looks forward to “delivering on the Trump agenda, supporting our Greek allies, and ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity.”Trump Jr also chimed in, saying he was “so proud of Kimberly” and confident she would “be an amazing leader.” Whether he’ll join her in Greece remains unanswered, leaving the tabloids to speculate further.For now, all eyes are on Guilfoyle as she steps onto the global stage, carrying both her new diplomatic role and the weight of swirling headlines.","Kimberly Guilfoyle was named ambassador to Greece on Wednesday.

What is the Luigi Mangione '286 Conspiracy Theory'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-luigi-mangione-286-conspiracy-theory/articleshow/116176938.cms,"The Case: The Murder of Brian Thompson



Details of the Crime



Mangione’s Arrest



Key Connections to the Number 286







Timeline of Events



The ""286 conspiracy theory"" centers on the alleged connections between Luigi Mangione—a suspect in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson—and the number 286. Internet sleuths have identified several supposed links between this number and various aspects of Mangione’s life, actions, and the murder, fueling speculation about deeper meanings or intentions.On December 7, 2024, Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was fatally shot outside a Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan. Surveillance footage captured a masked gunman fleeing the scene, described by witnesses as wearing dark clothing and carrying a concealed weapon. The attack occurred at approximately 9:15 PM as Thompson exited a private dinner event. The gunman fired multiple shots, striking Thompson in the chest and abdomen. Despite immediate emergency response, Thompson was pronounced dead upon arrival at a nearby hospital.Thompson was a significant figure in the corporate healthcare industry, known for leading cost-cutting measures and streamlining insurance policies. While these efforts were celebrated by some in the corporate world, they also attracted criticism from activists and patients who felt neglected by the healthcare system.The weapon used in the murder was a ghost gun, an untraceable firearm assembled from unregulated parts. This type of weapon, favored by those seeking to avoid detection, was later discovered among Mangione’s possessions. Witness accounts and surveillance footage showed the suspect fleeing north on foot in a calculated manner, leading authorities to believe the crime was premeditated. Investigators connected Mangione to the murder using ballistic evidence, digital footprints, and his documented animosity toward the corporate healthcare sector.Two days after the murder, on December 9, 2024, Mangione was arrested at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He was found in possession of a ghost gun similar to the one used in the murder, a three-page handwritten manifesto detailing his grievances against corporate America, and forged identification documents. Investigators determined that Mangione had fled Manhattan immediately after the crime, using cash and burner phones to evade capture.The number 286 has emerged as a recurring element in the investigation, with internet sleuths drawing various connections. One notable link is the Pokémon Breloom, which holds the Pokédex number 286. This Pokémon featured prominently in Mangione’s X (formerly Twitter) account banner, leading some to speculate that it was chosen intentionally.Some have tied the number to Proverbs 28:6, a Bible verse stating, “Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity than a rich man who is crooked in his ways.” This verse has been interpreted as reflective of Mangione’s disdain for corporate greed and figures like Thompson. Furthermore, in healthcare billing, denial code 286 refers to claims denied due to failure to meet appeal deadlines—a symbolic connection given Mangione’s documented criticism of the healthcare system.On December 7, 2024, Brian Thompson was fatally shot outside the Hilton hotel in Manhattan. Surveillance footage captured the gunman fleeing the scene. The following day, police identified Mangione as a person of interest based on digital evidence and previous anti-corporate statements. On December 9, Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where he was charged with weapons possession and forgery. Authorities began preparing murder charges based on ballistic evidence and Mangione’s manifesto. On December 10, Mangione appeared in court, and prosecutors revealed his potential motivations and ties to the healthcare industry.The Luigi Mangione ""286 conspiracy theory"" hinges on the idea that a single number ties together various elements of a murder case, reflecting either deliberate symbolism or an unusual string of coincidences. While the significance of 286 remains speculative, the case has captivated public interest, demonstrating how patterns—real or imagined—can influence the narratives of high-profile investigations.","The ""286 conspiracy theory"" centers on the alleged connections between Luigi Mangione and the number 286.

However, in October Bezos said The Post would not endorse any candidate, effectively blocking its endorsement of Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, according to NPR.This led to thousands of readers canceling their subscriptions and sparking protests among journalists associated with the newspaper. Bezos said this was to boost credibility as most people believe the media to be biased.Trump also met Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg a few weeks ago at his Mar-a-Lago mansion.The two have also had a tense relationship, with Trump being removed from Facebook after the January 6, 2021 attacks on the US Capitol.

WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden is closely monitoring the situation in Bangladesh and the US will hold the country's interim government accountable for ensuring the protection of religious and ethnic minorities, the White House has said. The security situation in Bangladesh has been difficult following the ouster of the former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said.""And we have been working closely with the interim government to enhance the capability of their law enforcement and security services to deal with the challenge,"" Kirby said at a news conference on Thursday.Hasina was ousted as prime minister in the face of a massive anti-government protest in August.There have been a spate of incidents of violence against Hindus and other minorities, as well as attacks on temples in the last few weeks in Bangladesh.""We've been very clear in our engagement with all Bangladeshi leaders that protection of religious and ethnic minorities is absolutely critical, and the leaders of the interim government have repeatedly committed to providing security to all Bangladeshis, regardless of religion or ethnicity,"" he said.""We want to hold them to that,"" Kirby said in response to a question.Over the past few weeks, Indian Americans have held peaceful protests and marches in several cities, including in front of the White House, in Chicago, New York, SFO, Detroit, Houston and Atlanta, urging Biden to help stop alleged brutalities against the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh.Earlier in the day, Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi urged members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to address the issue of violence against minorities, primarily Hindus, in Bangladesh during the confirmation hearing of Senator Marco Rubio for the position of secretary of state.President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Senator Rubio for the top diplomatic position.

Dozens of reported drone sightings in the skies above New Jersey have alarmed lawmakers and local officials and left them searching for answers. Gov. Phil Murphy said there were nearly 50 reported sightings in a single night over the weekend. And since mid-Nov, drones have been reported in at least 10 counties in New Jersey and in parts of New York City.Eleven drones have been spotted near Picatinny Arsenal, an army facility, since Nov 13, said its public affairs specialist Timothy Rider. He said the ""increased activity"" was not the result of military operations related to the base.John Kirby, spokesperson for National Security Council, said Thursday that federal authorities had not been able to corroborate any of the reported sightings. ""To the contrary, upon review of available imagery, it appears many of the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft that are being operated lawfully,"" Kirby said.Still, Kirby said the spate of reports and public concern underscored the importance of systems to detect and deter drones. Such tools should be made available to local law enforcement officials, he said.FBI and department of homeland security will continue to investigate the reported sightings, he said, stressing that they did not appear to pose a threat to public safety.Even as officials assured the public they had nothing to fear, New Jersey residents have described the rash of sightings as unsettling. Social media forums dedicated to the ""mystery"" have accumulated thousands of posts. One Facebook group has more than 25,000 members who share videos and swap theories.Robert Wheeler, assistant director of FBI's Critical Incident Response Group, said in testimony to Congress Tuesday that the bureau was ""actively investigating"" the sightings.In Ocean County, New Jersey, the local sheriff's office has been using its own drones to investigate night time sightings, hoping to determine where the objects land and what precisely they are. They have had little luck so far.""We're not getting good characteristics of the drone,"" said Sgt. Kevin Fennessy, who leads the office's drone unit. ""We had one the other night that, as we're watching it, it just shuts the lights off and it's gone in pure darkness."" From what he has seen so far, Fennessy thinks the objects are perhaps double the size of the drones in his fleet, flying at top speeds that are about 20mph faster. Ocean County is near the flight path for airplanes landing at Kennedy Airport in New York, but Fennessy believes the objects are indeed drones, since they do not appear on flight tracking software.Luis Figueiredo, a detective and drone specialist with the police department in New Jersey, said the descriptions of the sightings suggested that the drones were much larger and faster - and ""a lot more sophisticated"" - than those widely available to the public.But Joshua Tan, a professor of physics and astronomy at LaGuardia Community College, explained that while some sightings could be drones, others might be the consequence of confirmation bias: After hearing reports, people might become newly attentive to objects in the night sky.","Dozens of reported drone sightings in the skies above New Jersey have alarmed lawmakers and local officials.

The US military has transported Travis Timmerman , a 29-year-old American who was recently freed from a Syrian prison to safety in Jordan, US officials informed on Friday.Timmerman was released earlier this week during the dramatic fall of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, marking the end of his seven-month captivity.Timmerman was handed over to US troops at the Tanf garrison , a key military base near Syria’s borders with Iraq and Jordan, before being flown to Jordan on a military helicopter. US officials have confirmed that he is now with State Department representatives.According to US sources quoted by AP, Timmerman was freed from the notorious Palestine Branch detention facility after Syrian rebels stormed the prison, breaking down his cell door with a hammer. His release came alongside other detainees, including women and children, following the rebels’ takeover of Damascus and Assad’s flight to Russia.The White House stated it had no prior knowledge of Timmerman’s presence in Syria. Reports suggest he entered the country from Lebanon in June while on a religious pilgrimage. During his detention, Timmerman said he was treated fairly, describing his time in captivity as one of reflection. His family, based in Missouri, expressed relief at his return, with a cousin calling his rescue “the best Christmas gift.”Timmerman’s release comes as US officials and humanitarian groups continue efforts to locate Austin Tice , a freelance journalist missing in Syria since 2012.The fall of Assad’s regime has reignited hope for answers, as Syrians search prisons for loved ones and information surfaces about detainees.","Travis Timmerman, 29, was released from a Syrian prison earlier this week.

'Toy type': Drone crash in New Jersey backyard fuels mystery over recent sightings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/toy-type-drone-crash-in-new-jersey-backyard-fuels-mystery-over-recent-sightings/articleshow/116301680.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

A hobby drone crashed into a Pequannock Township homeowner’s backyard in Morris County, New Jersey, on Thursday night, sparking heightened concerns in a state already rattled by unexplained aerial phenomena .The Pequannock Police Department confirmed that the device, which fell around 8:45 pm, was “a hobby or toy type of drone” and not a military-grade or commercial craft, as reported by the New York Post.This incident adds to a wave of drone-related anxiety, partly fuelled by recent reports of large drones hovering near the highly secure Picatinny Arsenal.The facility, which develops military weaponry, has seen multiple sightings, raising concerns about potential espionage by foreign adversaries.Mayor Ryan Herd of Pequannock Township visited the crash site, emphasising his worries about unauthorised drones invading private property.Speaking to the New York Post, Herd stated, “Drones are flying over our houses, which is our private property. My family is here.” He urged residents to refrain from chasing or attempting to down drones, warning of potential catastrophic accidents.Adding to the tension, another report surfaced later that evening about a drone allegedly hitting a powerline in Randolph Township. However, the Morris County Sheriff’s Office confirmed the report was unfounded.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recently imposed temporary drone flight restrictions over key locations in New Jersey, including Picatinny Arsenal and the Bedminster golf course owned by President-elect Donald Trump.These measures followed reports of unusual drone activity in the region.New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy addressed the growing concerns earlier this week, describing the aircraft as “very sophisticated.” He assured residents the devices posed no immediate public threat but encouraged federal authorities to investigate. Murphy warned against shooting drones out of the sky but supported efforts to capture them for study.White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby revealed that federal investigators have been unable to confirm any of the over 3,000 reports of car-sized drones patrolling the skies.Meanwhile, Pentagon officials stated they do not believe these drones are linked to foreign entities.","A hobby drone crashed into a homeowner's backyard in Morris County, New Jersey, on Thursday night.

Pak SC conditionally allows army to announce military trial verdicts of pro-Imran protesters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-sc-conditionally-allows-army-to-announce-military-trial-verdicts-of-pro-imran-protesters/articleshow/116298908.cms,"Supreme Court of Pakistan

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in last year’s May 9 riots when protesters linked to the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) had stormed govt and military installations.A seven-member SC constitution bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin, specified that the military court verdicts would be subject to its final decision on appeals against its Oct 23, 2023 ruling barring the army from trying PTI protesters, saying military trials of civilians were unconstitutional.Local and international human rights organisations have expressed concern about the military trials, claiming that they do not adhere to the same evidentiary and due process norms as civilian courtsHundreds of PTI workers were arrested after they purportedly stormed military and govt buildings, and even torched a top commander’s house, following the former PM’s brief arrest by paramilitary soldiers on May 9, 2023 in a graft case. Among the detainees, the army initiated military trials against 103 accused on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military. Though Khan was released after three days, he was rearrested two months later in another corruption case and has been in jail since. There have been widespread reports that the military also plans to prosecute him under the same charges. He, however, has already been indicted by an anti-terrorism court over charges linked to the May 9 riots.The seven-member SC constitution bench was formed as a result of a controversial amendment to the constitution in Oct this year.“The final judgment of 85 persons who are under custody and facing trial before the military courts be announced and remissions admissible to the said persons be granted, and persons who can be released after remissions they be released forthwith, and persons who have to yet undergo the sentence awarded to them, their custody be handed over to the concerned jail authorities,” Friday’s court order read.The Pakistan Army Act of 1952 had established military courts, which function under a separate legal system, primarily for trial of military personnel or enemies of the state.The decision to use military courts for civilians was taken by Imran’sadversary, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during his first term in office, and was backed by the powerful military establishment.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in May 9 riots.

Bin Laden, Tehran and the Taliban



'Murdered my dreams'



PARACHINAR: Once again, Ali Ghulam receives mourners at his home -- his brother and nephew killed 40 years apart in the same sectarian conflict that was reignited this year in northwest Pakistan, claiming 200 lives since July alone.Thousands of residents are stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district, which borders Afghanistan, as the government struggles to end clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stemming from decades-old tensions over farmland.""Our generations yearn for peace,"" 72-year-old Ghulam told AFP at his home in Parachinar, the main town and a Shiite bastion of the restive district.The latest flare-up of violence has ""reopened wounds"" he said, recalling how his brother was killed in an attack in 1987 that also wounded another three of his brothers.Kurram, known as the ""Parrot's Beak"" for its protrusion into neighbouring Afghanistan, is bounded by dizzyingly high mountains, the northern flank of which includes the Tora Bora caves where Al Qaeda founder and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden once hid.Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for various militant groups, with militants and weapons able to flow largely unchecked in and out of Afghanistan.""I have never experienced peace in my life and have no hope my coming generations will live free of fear,"" Ghulam said.Tribal and family feuds are common in Pakistan.But they can be particularly protracted and violent in the mountainous tribal northwest, where communities live by traditional codes of honour and revenge.The latest round of violence in Kurram erupted in May and intensified in July, when gunmen opened fire on a council of elders attempting to settle the latest round of disagreements over land.Various truces announced since then have held for only weeks or days at a time.More than 300 shops and over 200 homes in Sunni areas have been destroyed, often by fire, and hundreds of families have fled.Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country with Shiites making up 10 to 15 percent of the population, or at least 25 million people.Members of the two sects have periodically clashed in Kurram, where Shiites are particularly vulnerable as they must pass through Sunni-majority neighbourhoods to access essential services.Kurram's location on the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan put it at the heart of the religious and political upheavals of the last five decades.In 1979, Shiites led a revolution in Iran and later that year the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, prompting Sunni hardliners there to rise up against them.Pakistan's military ruler Zia-ul-Haq aligned with them, funnelling thousands of Sunni militants into Afghanistan through Kurram.""It became a hub for arms supply to Afghanistan, including landmines, mortar shells, and weapons of all kinds. Every household in Kurram had a stockpile of weapons,"" Malik Attaullah Khan, a local tribal elder told AFP.Khan, who signed a 2007 agreement aimed at bringing peace to Kurram, criticised the government for failing to ""fulfil in its responsibilities"" in enforcing land settlements.The ethnic Pashtun heartland was merged into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in 2018, but the Pakistani state maintains limited control in the merged districts.In rural areas of Pakistan, villages often bypass the formal justice system and men-only ""jirgas"" or councils made up of respected village elders resolve disputes, sometimes in the form of fines or land reallocation.Ghulam's nephew was killed along with at least 42 others last month, when Sunni gunmen opened fire on a convoy of Shiites being escorted by the police to their homes.In retaliation, a market in a Sunni-dominated area was set on fire.Syed Ghani Shah told AFP his cousin was burned to death inside his shop.""When we buried him, he was so unrecognisable that we couldn't even let his parents see his face,"" Shah said.""Can we ever make peace after all this? Never, if we ever get the chance, we will surely avenge our blood,"" he warned.Authorities have enforced curfews and road closures to reduce the chances of violence breaking out, providing escorts through high-risk areas and using helicopters to deliver supplies.But Akbar Khan, a representative of Pakistan's independent Human Rights Commission told AFP that the state needs to do more to resolve the issue.""In the past, jirgas were successful because they had the full support of the state. Now, the authorities don't even provide the expenses needed to hold a jirga,"" he said.Fatima Ahmed's husband was killed last month while travelling to Islamabad to arrange her admission to medical college.""I don't want to live a life without him. I've lost my will to exist,"" the 21-year-old told AFP.""They haven't just martyred my husband -- they've also murdered my dreams with him,"" she said, bursting into tears.",Violence in northwest Pakistan has killed 200 people since July.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges, including engaging in political activities and violating a law on official secrets, during field general court martial (FGCM) proceedings against him, military's media affairs wing said Tuesday.Army's media arm ISPR said FGCM also charged Hameed with compromising state security and interests, abusing authority and resources and causing undue harm to individuals. ISPR said proceedings against Hameed were initiated on Aug 12 under provisions of Pakistan Army Act.Hameed, who served as ISI director-general from June 2019 to Oct 2021, was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. He was arrested over accusations about his involvement in land grabbing and snatching valuables and property from the owner of a private housing society. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable in a country where powerful generals have long wielded unparalleled influence in state affairs.""During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (Retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading up to multiple incidents including but not limited to the May 9, 2023 incident for fomenting instability, at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,"" ISPR said. The May 9 incident referred to countrywide protests when PTI supporters stormed army installations and govt buildings following the arrest of party chief and ex-PM Imran Khan for alleged graft. To many, Hameed's close association with Khan was the reason behind his arrest. Khan wanted to continue with Hameed as ISI head but then army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had been adamant on replacing him. Bajwa eventually succeeded and Khan could serve only a few months in office; he was later removed through a no-confidence.Independent observers say action against Hameed could put Khan under pressure and pave the way for the ex-PM to face a military court on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military.","Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries.

At least six Pakistani security personnel were killed and seven wounded on Saturday in an exchange of fire with militants in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Armed men killed six Pakistani security personnel and wounded seven in a checkpoint attack in the country’s northwest, a police official told news agency AP.The incident occurred in the same region where sectarian clashes have killed at least 130 people during the past few weeks.A ceasefire between the area’s Sunni and Shiite communities is holding and Saturday's incident is not connected to the recent clashes, according to AP.Local official Saleem Khan said armed men attacked a Frontier Corps checkpoint in Bagam, 200 kilometres (125 miles) south of Peshawar city. The wounded were taken to a military hospital.
