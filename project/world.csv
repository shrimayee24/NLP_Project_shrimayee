Two Men Accused Of Firing At Disha Patani's House Killed In Encounter

NEW DELHI: UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday compared a shooter arrested in connection with the firing at actor Disha Patani’s Bareilly house to “Maareech”, a demon from Ramayan.Speaking at a function in Lok Bhawan, Adityanath said, “A criminal involved in crimes against women came from outside the state. He possibly entered like Maareech, but when the UP police’s bullet hit him, he admitted he entered wrongly and said he would never show such audacity again.” The CM added that this approach should be applied to every criminal who threatens women’s safety.Police said one of the five shooters involved in the Bareilly incident, Ramanivas, was arrested along with his associate Anil after an encounter on Friday.A video circulating on social media shows him lying on the ground with folded hands, saying, “Baba ke Uttar Pradesh mein kabhi nahi aayenge sir” (I will never come to Baba’s Uttar Pradesh again). He appeared to be referring to Adityanath.Senior superintendent of police Anurag Arya said Ramanivas sustained a bullet injury in his leg during the encounter.Police recovered a 32-bore pistol, four live cartridges, and four spent shells from the accused.During questioning, Ramanivas confessed to his role in the firing, police said.On 12 September, two men on a motorcycle reportedly fired nine shots at the Patani family’s house in the Civil Lines area in Bareilly. Disha's father Jagdish Patani, his wife Padma, and their children Khushboo and Suryansh were at home. Disha Patani was not present at the time.","Yogi Adityanath compared a shooter arrested in connection with the firing at actor Disha Patani’s Bareilly house to “Maareech’, a demon from Ramayan.

Will talk to Reds if killings stop: Chhattisgarh deputy CM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-talk-to-reds-if-killings-stop-chhattisgarh-deputy-cm/articleshow/124021022.cms,"Chhattisgarh Deputy CM Vijay Sharma (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Chhattisgarh deputy CM Vijay Sharma on Saturday said govt was willing to positively consider the CPI(Maoist) offer to lay down arms and start peace negotiations, but the outfit must immediately stop civilian killings and remove IEDs it had planted across its areas of influence, reports Bharti Jain .“The CPI(Maoist) letter issued by its spokesperson Abhay was written on Aug 15 but issued a month later. But even after Aug 15, there have been killings of two shikshadoots (temporary, visiting teachers), on Aug 27 in Bijapur and on Aug 29 in Sukma. On Sept 2, two more civilians were killed by Maoists in Sukma,” he said.The CPI(Maoist) offer to suspend armed ‘struggle’ and the wanton killing of civilians and IED ambushes cannot go together. The leadership must first instruct its cadres on the ground to end civilian killings and de-mine the network of IEDs they have planted,” Chhattisgarh deputy CM Vijay Sharma told TOI .Inspector general, Bastar range, P Sunderraj added that it would take Maoists no more than a week to deactivate the IEDs — laid across ‘core areas’ in the Dandakaranya region and on Bihar-Jharkhand border —if such a directive was issued by the top leadership.The Chhattisgarh deputy CM said the final call on CPI(Maoist)’s peace offer will be taken by the top political leadership, comprising the prime minister and home minister, after careful consideration and due consultation with all the stakeholders.“We are ready to welcome Maoists with open arms if they choose to come forward, including starting with a video call, and lay down arms; we will ensure their rehabilitation and reintegration into the mainstream,” said the Chattisgarh deputy CM.For the time being, he underlined, there is no directive to the counterNaxal forces to scale down operations.As per intelligence reports, a secret meeting had purportedly taken place in Aug among a few top CPI (Maoist) leaders, including Mallojula Venugopal Rao, alias ‘Abhay’. Thippiri Tirupathi, alias Devji, the new general secretary after the neutralisation of Basavaraju in May, had attended the meeting, a source claimed. The discussions were focused on the crackdown by the forces in their old pocket boroughs and the way forward. “We are still evaluating if Devji is on the same page as Abhay on laying down arms, even though the Aug 15 statement was issued by the latter as the CPI(Maoist) spokesperson,” a senior intelligence officer said but added that even if a section of leadership favours peace talks, it should be followed through.The confusion within the CPI(Maoist) on the peace move has arisen thanks to a statement issued by its Telangana state committee on Friday, disagreeing with the unconditional peace offer of ‘Abhay’ alias Sonu and insisting that it was not “authorized” by the party.""Had Devji and Abhay, two of CPI(Maoist) seniormost leaders, been in agreement, the Telangana state committee would not have dared to issue such a statement,"" said an officer.The Telangana committee, in the statement dated Sept 19, opined that it was immature ""to say in public that there were no internal consultations on laying down arms, and asking for a month for the same"".""When a leader/cadre wants to give up the path of violence and join the mainstream, he discusses it within the party forum and gets approval. By not consulting the party formations, a state of confusion has arisen between the party and its military formations,” the Telangana committee noted and asked all extremist and political formations to disregard the unconditional peace offer made through Abhay. “The struggle against fascist BJP and its anti-people policies must be intensified,” it stated.","Chhattisgarh deputy CM Vijay Sharma said govt was willing to positively consider the CPI(Maoist) offer to lay down arms and start peace negotiations.

Monica Kelsey says Safe Haven Baby Box near Laken Snelling’s home could have saved infant

Laken Snelling admits to giving birth and hiding baby in Lexington home closet

Laken Snelling, a 21-year-old former University of Kentucky cheerleader, was arrested in Lexington, Kentucky, on August 30, 2025. Police charged her with abuse of a corpse, tampering with physical evidence, and concealing the birth of an infant. Just days before, on August 27, officers found a newborn baby dead inside a closet at her off-campus home. The baby was discovered after someone called 911 to report an unresponsive child. According to Fox 56 News, Lexington had opened its first Safe Haven Baby Box earlier this year, only 10 minutes from where Snelling lived.Monica Kelsey, the founder of Safe Haven Baby Boxes, spoke out after the case. She explained that these boxes are built into fire stations or hospitals and allow parents to safely and anonymously leave a baby.Each box locks from the outside after a child is placed inside, and staff inside the building can open the interior door to take the baby within minutes.Kelsey told Fox 56 News, “What’s frustrating to me is that she didn’t choose something safe for her and her child. Now we have a dead infant, and we also have a mother that’s probably going to spend the rest of her life in prison. Both could have been avoided.”Lexington’s first Safe Haven Baby Box was installed at Fire Station 2 earlier in 2025.Kelsey added that Snelling may not have even known the box was so close to her home.She said, “We’re being reactive to a dead infant. I want to be proactive. I want people to know these boxes exist and that they work.”On the morning of August 27, 2025, around 10:30 a.m., police received a call from a third party about a baby at Snelling’s Lexington home. When officers arrived, they found the newborn wrapped in a towel and placed inside a black trash bag in a closet. The baby was described as “cold to the touch.”Also Read: Andre Agassi And Steffi Graf’s Son Jaden Agassi Shares Unseen Photos With Catherine Holt As Couple Celebrates Love Laken Snelling later admitted to giving birth, cleaning up, and hiding the evidence. According to court records reported by People, she placed cleaning supplies and the infant inside the same trash bag.At the time police entered the home, Snelling herself was not there. She was found five minutes away and later taken into custody.Laken Snelling was booked on August 30 and appeared in court on September 2, where she pleaded not guilty. She was released the same day on a $100,000 bond. She is now on house arrest with her parents in Tennessee while awaiting her next court date on September 26.A first autopsy of the infant came back inconclusive, and further tests are underway.","Laken Snelling, a 21-year-old former University of Kentucky cheerleader, was arrested in Lexington, Kentucky, on August 30, 2025.

Trump’s Big Strike On Indians; $100,000 Fee Slapped On H-1B Visas





The US administration plans a major change to the H-1B visa programme, with President Donald Trump expected to sign a proclamation Friday imposing a $100,000 application fee, according to a White House official, quoted in a Bloomberg report.The order is intended to curb misuse of the visa category and its perceived impact on American jobs. Entry under the programme would require the hefty payment, the official said (anonymously), while the Labour Secretary will be directed to begin revising H-1B wage rules to protect US workers from wage suppression.The technology sector, a heavy user of H-1B visas, is likely to feel the sharpest effects. The White House argues the new measures will bolster the integrity of the system and reduce exploitation. A document reviewed by Bloomberg News describes the replacement of American workers with lower-cost foreign labour as a national-security issue that discourages domestic STEM careers.It remains unclear whether the $100,000 fee will be added to or replace existing charges. Current costs include a $215 lottery registration and a $780 Form I-129 filing.The programme grants 85,000 visas annually through a lottery that some firms allegedly game by submitting multiple applications, often to hire lower-paid staff via staffing and outsourcing companies.This move aligns with broader immigration fee hikes for work permits, asylum requests and other services, intended to fund detention facilities, expanded border barriers and additional enforcement personnel.","The technology sector, a heavy user of H-1B visas, is likely to feel the sharpest effects.

Charlie Kirk special dropped: Why did Sinclair pull tribute last minute? Aired 'Family Fued' instead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/charlie-kirk-special-dropped-why-did-sinclair-pull-tribute-last-minute-aired-family-fued-instead/articleshow/124023726.cms,"The move follows a wave of backlash triggered by Kimmel’s Monday monologue, in which he accused conservatives of “reaching new lows” while discussing 22-year-old suspect Tyler Robinson, charged with Kirk’s murder.





Sinclair Broadcast Group pulled a highly publicised Charlie Kirk special just minutes before it was due to air, opting instead to broadcast a rerun of ABC’s “Family Feud” on its stations late on Friday night. The decision came amid ongoing controversy over comedian Jimmy Kimmel’s remarks about Kirk’s alleged assassin.The special, which had been promoted for days, was removed at 11:24 p.m. Eastern, six minutes before its scheduled start. Sinclair announced that the programme would instead be available on The National News Desk’s YouTube channel. “Tonight, Sinclair will continue to air ABC network programming as scheduled in the late-night time period,” the company said, ensuring viewers could still access ABC content while providing full access to the Kirk special online.The last-minute cancellation of the Kirk special drew a wave of criticism on social media. Users highlighted the abrupt timing, noting that Sinclair had promised earlier in the week to air the programme in Kimmel’s late-night slot, only to pull it ten minutes before broadcast. At 11:24 p.m. Eastern, Sinclair stations switched to ABC’s “Family Feud” rerun instead, prompting speculation about what occurred behind the scenes with ABC.Commenters were scathing about the production, with one user writing: “No wonder @WeAreSinclair didn’t air this ‘tribute’, seems like a highschooler made it.”The move follows a wave of backlash triggered by Kimmel’s Monday monologue, in which he accused conservatives of “reaching new lows” while discussing 22-year-old suspect Tyler Robinson, charged with Kirk’s murder. Kimmel was criticised for seemingly suggesting Robinson had MAGA ties, although prosecutors later reaffirmed the suspect’s left-wing connections. Kimmel had intended to clarify his comments on Wednesday’s episode, but Disney suspended the show indefinitely before he could respond.Sinclair, which operates 30 ABC affiliates, had initially announced it would air a tribute to Kirk in Kimmel’s late-night slot. Vice Chairman Jason Smith called Kimmel’s remarks “inappropriate and deeply insensitive at a critical moment for our country,” saying the network would not reinstate the show until “formal discussions” with ABC addressed professionalism and accountability. Sinclair also urged Kimmel to apologise to the Kirk family and donate to both the family and Turning Point USA, the conservative group founded by Kirk.Nexstar Media Group, another major ABC affiliate operator, similarly announced it would stop broadcasting Kimmel’s programme. Broadcasting chief Andrew Alford said Kimmel’s comments were “offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse” and that continuing the show was “not in the public interest.”The suspension and subsequent network actions have drawn attention beyond the media industry. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr welcomed Disney’s decision, while former President Donald Trump described it as “great news for America.” Conservatives debated whether the move represented government overreach, while liberal critics accused Disney of yielding to political pressure, with Representative Daniel Goldman calling it “folding to a wannabe mob boss and his authoritarian goons. ”The abrupt last-minute withdrawal of the Kirk special highlights the ongoing tensions between media corporations, political figures, and public opinion, leaving viewers to access the content online rather than on traditional television.Last-minute pull: Sinclair drops Charlie Kirk special; airs ABC rerun instead","Sinclair Broadcast Group pulls highly publicised Charlie Kirk special.

‘Nearly 550 arrested’: inside ICE’s Chicago operation 'Midway Blitz'; tensions escalate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nearly-550-arrested-inside-ices-chicago-operation-midway-blitz-tensions-escalate-video/articleshow/124023545.cms,"Operation unfolds amid tension and criticism







Immigration enforcement officials have arrested almost 550 people in the Chicago area as part of an operation launched on September 8, the Department of Homeland Security said Friday. The updated figure follows a senior ICE official telling The Associated Press that more than 400 arrests had already been made, signalling a major enforcement effort similar to operations in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.The arrests involve Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as well as other federal agencies supporting the operation, dubbed “Midway Blitz.” Activists and immigrant communities have expressed concern over the noticeable increase in enforcement agents, fearing large-scale arrests or aggressive tactics reminiscent of other Trump administration operations. The operation has prompted allegations of excessive force and dragnets that have ensnared U.S. citizens, while Trump supporters see it as fulfilling promises of mass deportations.Marcos Charles, acting head of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, told the AP that roughly 50–60% of the arrests were targeted, involving individuals who had committed crimes, had a final order of removal, or were on ICE’s radar.The remainder were “collateral arrests,” meaning people encountered during operations who were in the country illegally but were not the original target. “It doesn’t mean that the collateral arrests are non-criminal. Some of our collateral arrests … also have criminal convictions and arrests. They just weren’t the people we were looking for at the time,” Charles said.A predawn ride-along with ICE showed officers carefully tracking suspects. In one instance, a man matching the target description was arrested after being discovered to be in the U.S. illegally, news agency AP reported. Charles called it a “successful operation,” adding: “There was no safety issues on the part of our officers, nor the individuals that we arrested. And it went smoothly.”Yet Chicago remains on edge following the September 12 shooting of Mexican immigrant Silverio Villegas González, who died after dragging an ICE officer during a traffic stop. Charles said he could not comment on the open investigation but met with the officer in hospital and felt the force used was appropriate. Critics, including Alderman Andre Vasquez, argue ICE is escalating tensions and provoking communities. “ICE does not belong here,” he said.The operation has brought more than 200 officers from around the country, with no timeline for its conclusion. Charles defended the surge, saying, “It was time to hit Chicago,” targeting cities where local policies have limited cooperation with federal immigration authorities.","Department of Homeland Security says almost 550 people have been arrested in Chicago area since September 8.

Tom Homan secretly probed for 'bribery' in 2024, report says; case closed under Trump",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-house-border-czar-in-trouble-tom-homan-probed-by-fbi-for-bribery-in-2024-report-says-case-closed-under-trump/articleshow/124021137.cms,"Tom Homan (File photo)





Tom Homan, US president Donald Trump’s close aide and his “border czar,” was the target of an FBI undercover operation last year, according to a report.As per MSNBC's exclusive report, Homan accepted $50,000 in cash after suggesting to undercover agents — who posed as business executives — he could help them secure government contracts in a second Trump administration.The probe began in Texas the summer of 2024, after a subject in a separate investigation claimed Homan was soliciting payments in exchange for awarding contracts should Trump win the presidential election. At the time, he was the president and owner of a private consulting business that offered to help companies in the border security sector secure government contracts.The FBI and Justice Department held off to see whether he would follow through if formally empowered under Trump.On November 11, 2024, six days after the presidential election that he won, the Republican named Homan as his “border czar.” Because the role is adversarial in nature, it did not require Senate confirmation or a full FBI background check.The matter stalled in January - shortly after Trump began his second and final term - despite investigators believing they had a strong criminal case. In recent weeks, the probe was officially closed after FBI director Kash Patel called for a status update.In a joint statement to the outlet, Patel and deputy attorney general Todd Blanche gave the following explanation:""The case originated under the previous Joe Biden administration. It was subjected to a full review by FBI agents and Justice Department prosecutors. They found no credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing. The department’s resources must remain focused on real threats to the American people, not baseless investigations. As a result, the investigation has been closed.""The White House criticised the probe as ""blatantly political"" and one that found no evidence of illegal activity.""Tom Homan has not been involved with any contract award decisions. He is a career law enforcement officer and lifelong public servant who is doing a phenomenal job on behalf of President Trump and the country,"" White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson said.In Trump's first term, Homan, 63, briefly served as the interim head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).","Tom Homan, US president Donald Trump’s close aide and his “border czar,’ was the target of an FBI undercover operation last year, according to a report.

Who is Mary Cleary?





A conservative lawyer who has denied allegations she took part in the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot has been appointed acting US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, following the ouster of the office’s chief on Friday.Mary “Maggie” Cleary informed staff of her appointment in an email on Saturday, writing, “While this appointment was unexpected, I am humbled to be joining your ranks,” according to the Associated Press.Cleary takes over from Erik Siebert, who was forced out amid a Trump administration push to bring criminal charges against New York attorney general Letitia James over alleged mortgage fraud. Trump later insisted he had fired Siebert, rejecting the latter's claims of a resignation.The investigation into James, a long-time Trump adversary, centers on paperwork discrepancies tied to her Brooklyn townhouse and a Virginia property. The Justice Department has yet to bring charges, and her attorneys have dismissed the inquiry as politically motivated retaliation.Cleary returned to the Justice Department recently as senior counsel in the criminal division after serving as a prosecutor in the Culpeper Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office.She also worked as deputy secretary of public safety under Virginia's Republican governor Glenn Youngkin and later in the office of the state's attorney general, Jason Miyares.Earlier this year, Cleary wrote in The Spectator World that she had been “wrongly identified” in a photo as being on Capitol grounds during the January 6 riot, while she was a federal prosecutor in Virginia. “Everyone knew I was a conservative. It was all over my resume. I was in leadership in my local Republican Committee. But I had not gone to the Capitol that day,” she wrote.She described being placed on administrative leave and questioned by agents before later being cleared to return to work. “In the last four years, I’ve been somewhat cautious about sharing my experience, but now, while Donald Trump is president, I feel emboldened to finally tell how I, too, was targeted politically,” Cleary added.","Mary ""Maggie"" Cleary appointed acting US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.

US Vice-President JD Vance has said that national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk , warning that such behaviour fuels further political violence.Speaking as guest host of The Charlie Kirk Show on Monday, Vance said: “Call them out, and hell, call their employer. We don't believe in political violence, but we do believe in civility.”The vice-president took over presenting duties from his ceremonial office at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, with the programme livestreamed into the White House press briefing room. It was the first episode of the podcast since Kirk, 31, was fatally shot in the neck while moderating a debate at Utah Valley University last week.Vance, who flew Kirk’s body home to Arizona aboard Air Force Two, said he was “filling in for somebody who cannot be filled in for”. He recounted conversations with Kirk’s widow Erika, describing him as “a kind, loving husband”, and admitted her words had inspired him to “be a better husband and… a better father”.In his remarks, Vance directly challenged those making light of Kirk’s assassination. “There is no unity with the people who celebrate Charlie Kirk's assassination,” he said.“There is no unity with someone who lies about what Charlie Kirk said in order to excuse his murder… And there is no unity with the people who fund these articles, who pay the salaries of these terrorist sympathisers who argue that Charlie Kirk, a loving husband and father, deserved a shot to the neck because he spoke words with which they disagree. ”He added: “I’m desperate for our country to be united in condemnation of the actions and the ideas that killed my friend. I want it so badly that I will tell you a difficult truth. We can only have it with people who acknowledge that political violence is unacceptable.”Other Republicans have echoed calls for accountability. Florida congressman Randy Fine said he would “demand their firing, defunding, and licence revocation”, while South Carolina’s Nancy Mace urged federal funding to be cut from universities that refuse to act.Vance, who described Kirk as a close friend and mentor, credited him with helping President Donald Trump’s re-election and with shaping the administration. “If it weren't for Charlie Kirk, I would not be the vice president of the United States,” he said.","US Vice-President JD Vance said national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

The Trucial States and British Control: Foundations of UAE National Day





1820–1853: A series of treaties were signed between Britain and the ruling sheikhs, starting with the defeat of the Qawasim maritime force. These agreements aimed to curb maritime conflict, prohibit the construction of warships or coastal fortifications, and maintain peace at sea.

1853: The Perpetual Maritime Truce formalized an indefinite end to hostilities at sea. Britain limited its role to maritime security without interfering in the internal governance of the emirates.

1892: The Exclusive Agreements prohibited the Trucial States from engaging with foreign powers without British approval. In exchange, the UK pledged military protection against external threats.



Path to federation: Early steps toward UAE National Day





February 18, 1968: Sheikh Zayed met with Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum of Dubai at Al Samha . They agreed to unite their emirates and invite others to join, forming the first step toward regional federation — the Union Accord.



They agreed to collaborate on foreign affairs, defense, security, social services, and immigration policy. Judicial and internal governance would remain under individual emirate control.

The proposed Federation of the Arab Emirates was based on 11 foundational principles including mutual respect for sovereignty, unified foreign policy, and joint developmental goals. A Supreme Council was to be established to oversee federal legislation and policy, with decisions requiring unanimous consent.

December 2, 1971: The birth of the UAE and National Day





July 18, 1971: The six Rulers formally agreed to establish a federation.

December 2, 1971: The United Arab Emirates was officially declared an independent, sovereign state.



A Provisional Constitution was adopted. Abu Dhabi was designated as the temporary capital. Sheikh Zayed was elected as the first President; Sheikh Rashid became Vice-President, both for a five-year term. The Federal National Council (FNC) was established with 34 seats:



8 each for Abu Dhabi and Dubai 6 for Sharjah 4 each for Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, and Fujairah Ras Al Khaimah was allocated 6 seats should it choose to join later.

The Provisional Constitution guided federal operations from 1971 until it was made permanent in July 1996.

It consists of 152 articles, establishing the foundation of:

1981: Co-founded the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.





December 2 marks a pivotal moment in the history of the United Arab Emirates — the day it became an independent, sovereign nation in 1971. But the choice of this date was not symbolic alone; it was the culmination of decades of treaties, negotiations, British withdrawal, and a shared vision among the region's leaders. This is the detailed story of how the UAE came to be, why December 2 became its National Day, and the constitutional foundations that shaped the Federation.The territory that is now the UAE was historically known as the Trucial States, a group of independent emirates along the southern coast of the Persian Gulf. British involvement in the region began in the early 19th century:British control over the region intensified in the mid-20th century, largely driven by oil exploration and geopolitical interests. They controlled oil concession grants and intervened in territorial disputes to secure exploration zones, including helping define inter-emirate boundaries in the 1950s.However, by 1968, economic constraints pushed the UK to announce a full military and political withdrawal from the Gulf by end of 1971. This move set off a chain of political activity among the Trucial States’ rulers to form a new, self-governed entity before the British departure.The initiative to form a unified state began with Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who became Ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1966. Seeing the necessity of regional cooperation, he envisioned a federation that could unify resources and political will.Despite this progress, Bahrain and Qatar opted for independent statehood in August and September 1971, respectively.As the British exit approached, six emirates — Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, and Fujairah — committed to forming a new union.The Supreme Council of Rulers, composed of the Rulers of each emirate, became the highest federal authority. Decisions would require a majority vote — with both Abu Dhabi and Dubai needed to be part of the majority for any decision to pass.Article 138 specifically enabled the unification of the UAE Armed Forces under federal command, ensuring centralized defense policy and organization.Several shared factors helped facilitate a smooth transition to federation:Immediately after its formation, the UAE began establishing itself as a credible state in the international community:","December 2 marks the UAE’s formation, uniting seven emirates into a strong, independent federation.

‘Majority American-owned’: White House outlines TikTok deal; signing soon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/majority-american-owned-white-house-outlines-tiktok-deal-signing-soon/articleshow/124023302.cms,"



The White House has given fresh details on a deal over TikTok’s future in the United States, saying an agreement is “close to being finalised” and will ensure American control of the platform’s operations, data, and algorithm.Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that the arrangement, reached after months of negotiations with China, would make TikTok “majority owned by Americans in the United States” with six of seven seats on its new governing board held by Americans. “The data and privacy will be led by one of America's greatest tech companies, Oracle, and the algorithm will also be controlled by America as well,” she said.Leavitt praised officials who led the talks. “Great credit to Secretary Besant and Ambassador Jamison Greer and our vice president, JD Vance, who really led the charge on this and have been negotiating with the Chinese for months,” she said. “They were able to accomplish a deal that puts America first and keeps Tick Tock open for all of the young Americans and all of the small businesses who have benefited greatly from selling their products and really creating a name for themselves on this highly popular app. ”President Donald Trump, who discussed the deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping in a phone call on Friday, echoed that confidence. “We have great American patriots that are buying it — very, very substantial people, people that love our country,” he told reporters.“And they’re very smart technologically, and they will not let anything bad happen to TikTok.”Leavitt stressed that Trump had “recognized the need to protect Americans’ privacy and data while also keeping this app open” and even credited TikTok as “a vital part of our democratic process.” She added that the president believed the platform, along with conservative activist Charlie Kirk, played a role in energising young voters in the last election.While China has yet to confirm the reported approval of the deal, Leavitt insisted the framework was set. “All of those details have already been agreed upon. Now we just need this deal to be signed. And that will be happening, I anticipate, in the coming days,” she said.Congress had previously passed legislation mandating a TikTok ban in January unless Chinese parent company ByteDance divested its US operations. Trump has repeatedly delayed its enforcement while pursuing a deal he says will ensure “very good control” of the platform.","The White House has given fresh details on a deal over TikTok’s future in the United States.

California governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday signed a law prohibiting most law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, from covering their faces while conducting official business.The state is the first in the US to enact such a ban, a direct response to the recent immigration raids in Los Angeles where masked federal agents made mass arrests. The raids triggered days of violent protests in June and led President Donald Trump to deploy National Guard troops and Marines to the city.Newsom, a Democrat and frequent Trump critic, framed the measure as a ""defence"" of California’s diversity, noting that 27 per cent of residents are foreign-born. “We celebrate that diversity. It’s what makes California great. It’s what makes America great. It is under assault,” he said, according to the Associated Press.The new rule bars officers from wearing coverings such as ski masks and neck gaiters, though exceptions exist for undercover work, medical masks, tactical gear, and state police.The law’s enforceability against federal agents remains unclear. A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official called the legislation “despicable,” arguing it endangers officers.DHS has already warned California and other Democratic-led states that it would take “all appropriate measures” if they continue resisting federal immigration detainers.Newsom, a potential candidate for US presidency in 2028, asserted the law would help California push back against “federal overreach.”Trump administration officials have defended the use of face coverings, arguing that immigration agents face mounting harassment in public and online as they carry out the president’s mass deportation agenda. Masking their identities, they say, is necessary to protect both the officers and their families.Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin noted in a statement this week that federal agents are already required to identify themselves and wear vests marked with ICE or Homeland Security during operations.","California governor Gavin Newsom signed a law prohibiting most law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, from covering their faces.

US President Donald Trump on Saturday demanded that Venezuela immediately repatriate prisoners and ""people from mental institutions"" sent to the United States by the government of Nicolás Maduro, warning of an “incalculable” price if his demands are not met.On his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote: “We want Venezuela to immediately accept all of the prisoners, and people from mental institutions, which includes the Worst in the World Insane Asylums, that Venezuelan ‘Leadership’ has forced into the United States of America.”He added that “thousands of people” have been hurt or killed by such “monsters” and warned: “GET THEM THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY, RIGHT NOW, OR THE PRICE YOU PAY WILL BE INCALCULABLE!”The warning comes amid rising tensions between Washington and the Maduro administration, which the United States does not officially recognise. In recent days, US forces, acting under Trump’s instructions, have carried out three strikes targeting Venezuelan vessels allegedly involved in narcoterrorism.In August, the US State Department increased the reward for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Maduro to $50 million, up from $25 million.

Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have a decades-long defence partnership, and while the United States provides the overall security framework, in many cases Pakistan has provided manpower and expertise in the military domain, said a source, recalling that whenever Gulf states have come under threat, whether from Arab nationalism or Iran, they have turned to Pakistan.As per Indian authorities, the Pakistan-Saudi Arabia pact only formalises the existing understandings, particularly on Pakistani support to Saudi Arabia, and that the timeline may have been accelerated by the recent attacks on Doha.Saudi Arabia had first signed a defence agreement with Pakistan in 1967 and upgraded it in 1982 through a bilateral security cooperation agreement.

Waters recede, but threat not over

Fields and cattle lost





Even as floodwaters began to recede in parts of south Punjab, the scale of destruction remains staggering, nearly 2.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes and at least 101 lives have been lost, the Dawn reported.The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has called the ongoing evacuation and relief drive one of the largest in recent memory. More than 1,500 boats were deployed to rescue stranded families, with 12,427 people evacuated from villages along the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers.Multan, Muzaffargarh and Rahim Yar Khan districts bore the brunt of the floods. Entire villages were submerged — including the union council of Lati Mari in Alipur tehsil, home to 40,000 people.“Nearly 15,000 people from our basti had to leave on their own as water rose,” said Syed Kausar Shah, a local resident. “Homes and crops were destroyed, and people escaped on a hired boat. Some now live in relief camps, others under the open sky.” He added that two villagers drowned while attempting to flee.Officials declared Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur tehsils safe after a major flood wave passed through Head Panjnad.Multan Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu confirmed that 100,000 people had been evacuated from Jalalpur Pirwala alone in three days.Breaches in Shujabad and Jalalpur Pirwala are now being filled, while helicopters and drones drop food and medicine into cut-off areas. Boats continue to ferry supplies into rural belts.At a press briefing in Bahawalpur, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said Panjnad Headworks still faced a “high flood” but levels had dropped from 700,000 cusecs earlier this week to 575,000 cusecs on Saturday. By evening, the Flood Forecasting Division reported further decline to 492,695 cusecs.“There is no threat to Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur cities,” Kathia assured, adding that water in Bahawalpur would also recede within 24 hours. He called the scale of evacuation “historic,” stressing that Multan could have faced forced evacuations if operations were delayed.According to official data, 4,447 mouzas across 28 districts have been inundated.

The sons of jailed former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said their father “will not be broken” by his “unlawful” imprisonment, as his legal team lodged an appeal with the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture.The elder son, Sulaiman Khan, condemned Khan's treatment in a statement attached to the appeal:Our father is being kept in conditions that no human being should endure. These are violations of his rights, and they amount to torture.”The younger son, Kasim Khan, said:The UN has already recognised that our father’s imprisonment is arbitrary and unlawful. What he is enduring now shows how far the regime will go to break him. But he will not be broken.”Sulaiman and Kasim are the cricketer-turned-politician’s sons with British filmmaker Jemima Goldsmith, with whom he was married for nine years until 2004. They live in the UK with Goldsmith.The appeal, filed by the US-based law firm Perseus Strategies on behalf of Khan’s legal team, alleged a “systematic pattern of abuse, including prolonged solitary confinement, denial of medical care, contaminated food, and restricted access to legal counsel and family visits.”His lawyers argued that these conditions breach Pakistan’s obligations under the UN Convention against Torture (CAT) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). They urged the UN to press authorities to safeguard the former PM’s physical and mental well-being.Khan has been in prison since August 2023 after being charged in multiple cases.","The sons of jailed former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said their father “will not be broken” by his “unlawful” imprisonment.

A Pakistani Taliban ambush in northwest Pakistan on Saturday resulted in the deaths of at least 12 soldiers, as confirmed by local government and security officials to AFP.During a military convoy's passage through South Waziristan district at 4:00 am, ""armed men opened fire from both sides with heavy weapons"", resulting in 12 security personnel deaths and four injuries, according to a local government official.The area's security officer verified the casualties and reported that the assailants captured the convoy's weaponry.The Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban, took responsibility for the attack via social media.This incident ranks among the most severe attacks in recent months within Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where the TTP previously controlled significant territories until a 2014 military operation forced their retreat.Since the Afghan Taliban's return to power in Kabul in 2021, militant activities have intensified in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border regions. Although distinct organisations, the TTP maintains close ties with the Afghan Taliban.Pakistan contends that Afghanistan fails to remove militants who use Afghan soil to attack Pakistan, whilst Kabul authorities reject these claims.Local residents across various Khyber Pakhtunkhwa districts have recently reported TTP-branded graffiti appearing on buildings, expressing concerns about a potential return to the group's previous control during the height of the US ""War on Terror"".A high-ranking local government official recently informed AFP about increased TTP fighter presence and attack frequency.Since January 1, approximately 460 individuals, predominantly security forces personnel, have lost their lives in attacks by anti-state armed groups in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces, according to AFP's records.Pakistan experienced its most lethal period in nearly ten years during the previous year, with over 1,600 fatalities, including almost half being soldiers and police officers, as reported by the Islamabad-based Center for Research and Security Studies.","Pakistani Taliban ambush in northwest Pakistan kills at least 12 soldiers.

KATHMANDU: The 'Gen Z' group on Saturday demanded the arrest of deposed prime minister K P Sharma Oli and then home minister Ramesh Lekhak over their alleged role in a shootout that killed 19 people during the anti-government protests on September 8.Addressing a press conference at Sambad Dabali here, Dr Nicholas Bushal, one of the advisers to the Gen Z group that spearheaded the protests, said Oli, Lekhak and Chief District Officer of Kathmandu Chhabi Rijal should be arrested immediately as they were directly responsible for the shootout at Naya Baneshwor in which 19 activists were killed.Bhushal also demanded the formation of a high-level probe commission to investigate the wealth of all high-ranking leaders and government officials since 1990.Separately, the Gen Z activists also organised a sit-in demanding Oli and Lekhak's arrest at Maitighar Mandala near Singhdurbar Secretariat in Kathmandu, from where they started their protest rally on September 8.At least 72 people, including three policemen, were among the dead during the violent protests against alleged corruption and a ban on social media on September 8 and 9.On Friday, the former prime minister denied that he had given any shooting orders during the Gen Z demonstrations, saying bullets were fired at protesters from automatic guns that the police did not possess and called for a probe into the matter.In his first public statement since his ouster, the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) chairman blamed the infiltrators for the violence during the ""peaceful protest"" by Gen-Z.""The government didn't order to shoot at the demonstrators,"" 73-year-old Oli said in a message issued on the occasion of Constitution Day.""The bullets were fired at the protesters from automatic guns, which were not possessed by the police personnel, and this must be investigated,"" Oli said.Oli quit on September 9 shortly after hundreds of agitators entered his office demanding his resignation.Meanwhile, Supreme Court Chief Justice Prakash Man Singh Raut on Saturday said that the apex court had not issued an order to ban social media sites.""The Supreme Court had not ordered the government to shut down social media sites,"" CJ Raut said while talking to the media in Kathmandu.The apex court had urged the government to regularise the social media sites through formulating necessary laws which is a normal international practice, he said.The Oli-led government had banned 26 social media sites citing the Supreme Court's order, which sparked protests from the Gen Z group on September 8.

Together since the 1960s, they married in Kabul in 1970.""Two British nationals named Peter and Barbara Reynolds, who had violated the laws of Afghanistan, were released from custody today following the judicial process,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi said on social media.He added that the government ""does not view the matters of citizens from a political or transactional angle"".“God is good, as they say in Afghanistan,” Barbie Reynolds said after she arrived at Kabul International Airport to fly out of the country.The Reynolds’ family members in the U.K. repeatedly called for the couple’s release, saying they were being mistreated and held on undisclosed charges. While the Taliban rejected the abuse allegations, they have never explained what prompted their detention, AP reported.“This is a moment of immense joy for our family, and we are deeply thankful to everyone who played a role in securing their release,” the family said in a statement after their release, mentioning Qatar and the British governments.“This experience has reminded us of the power of diplomacy, empathy, and international co-operation. While the road to recovery will be long as our parents regain their health and spend time with their family, today is a day of tremendous joy and relief.”Their son Jonathan told Sky News in April his parents had ""never heard one accusation or one charge"". He said the British govt had offered to evacuate them when the Taliban took over, to which they replied: ""Why would we leave these people in their darkest hour?Qatar, an energy-rich nation on the Arabian Peninsula that mediated talks between the U.S. and the Taliban before the American withdrawal, assisted in releasing the Reynolds couple from Afghanistan, a diplomat said. The couple left Afghanistan on Friday. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations involved in the case.Earlier this month, the Taliban said they had reached an agreement with US envoys on a prisoner exchange as part of an effort to normalise relations. The meeting came after the Taliban in March released US citizen George Glezmann, who was abducted while travelling through Afghanistan as a tourist. Afghanistan remains a focus of US President Donald Trump. On Thursday, while visiting the UK, Trump suggested that he was working to reestablish a US presence at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. Zakir Jalaly, an official at the Taliban’s Foreign Ministry, dismissed the idea.Reynolds couple were flown to Doha and are now on their way home to be reunited with their family.","Barbie Reynolds, 76, and her husband Peter, 80, were taken into custody by the Taliban’s interior ministry on February 1 and moved to a maximum-security prison in Kabul in March.

Today is Constitution Day — the day the Nepali people, after 70 years of struggle, saw the constitution enacted by the

Constituent Assembly

they themselves had elected. It is the day when a democratic republic, a federal inclusive system, and the rights of the people were established.

The challenges we faced while drafting this constitution are still fresh in your memory. Even overcoming blockades and threats to the country’s

sovereignty

, the constitution was promulgated. Therefore, Nepal’s constitution is a blueprint for the future that the Nepali people have written for themselves.

After the constitution was enacted, we were building transport structures connecting north and south to make the landlocked country accessible and resilient against blockades. We had also signed transport agreements with our northern neighbor and were expanding the strength of our sovereignty. We were laying the foundations for development structures and the economy was growing steadily.

Last week, during what was supposed to be a peaceful Jan Gatha (Jan-G) protest, intruders entered — as the organizers themselves had claimed. Conspirators who infiltrated caused violence, resulting in the deaths of our youth. The government had not ordered the demonstrators to be fired upon. The investigation must determine how automatic weapons, which the police did not possess, were used. I again express my grief over the incident, pay tribute to the deceased youth, and wish speedy recovery to the injured.

At this moment, our constitution is under a major attack. After my resignation from the position of Prime Minister, Singha Durbar was set on fire — the map of Nepal was burned, and the national symbol was targeted for erasure. Offices of public representatives, courts, business institutions, political party offices, the homes of leaders and activists, and personal property were systematically destroyed.

I will not speak much today about the

conspiracy

behind this; time itself will reveal many truths. Was our country truly being destroyed, or was anger being stirred up merely through fabricated narratives of destruction? Our new generation will realize this for themselves. Society that once criticized the crowds at airports will, in time, understand what it means when external movement is blocked. Our new generation will come to understand all of this.

However, this is something that must be understood now; if not, our country’s sovereignty will exist only in history.

Our youth must have read the history of Bhim Malla’s death sentence. Bhim Malla, after expanding the country’s borders and returning, was executed upon his return, leaving only regret as the option. Outcomes of discontent fueled beyond reality only serve as lessons in regret, and such regret will deepen the memory of the nation being built.

All Nepalis across generations must unite — to face attacks on our sovereignty and defend our constitution. Sovereignty is our existence, and the constitution is the armor of our freedom. Only our unity can lift and protect the country from this unimaginable crisis.

I appeal to everyone —

Let us protect the constitution, let us defend our sovereignty.

Nepal In Flames: PM KP Oli Resigns, Flees In Army Chopper As Gen Z Protesters Burn Down Parliament





Days after massive unrest upended Nepal’s political situation, deposed Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has shifted from army protection to a private residence. According to news agency PTI, citing Nepal army sources, Oli spent nine days under army security before moving out.Oli had flown to an army barracks -- believed to be in the Shivapuri forest area, north of Kathmandu on September 9, immediately after the Gen Z-led protests turned violent and he resigned as Prime Minister.After nine days in army security, the chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) (CPN-UML) relocated to a private location, the Nepal Army confirmed.However, his current address has not been officially disclosed. Media reports indicate that Oli has shifted to a private house in the Gundu area of Bhaktapur district, about 15 km east of Kathmandu.During the second day of the protests on September 9, Gen Z demonstrators burned Oli’s house in Balkot, Bhaktapur, to ashes. On the same day, while Oli was at the official residence of the Nepal Prime Minister, protesters also partially torched the Prime Minister’s Office in Balkot. He was safely evacuated by a Nepal Army helicopter.Several other senior political figures -- including former Prime Ministers Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda,’ Sher Bahadur Deuba, Jhalanath Khanal, Madhav Kumar Nepal, and others -- had also taken shelter under army protection for a few days. At present, only Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba and his spouse, former foreign minister Arzju Rana Deuba, remain under army security. The couple sustained injuries during the protests and are currently receiving hospital treatment under military protection.Meanwhile, the CPN-UML, led by Oli, is planning a separate event to mark Constitution Day on September 19 at Chyasal in Lalitpur district, where the party’s central office is located. However, it remains uncertain whether Oli will attend the programme.Nepal will observe Constitution Day on Ashoj 3 of the Bikram Era calendar—September 19 this year—marking the promulgation of the country’s constitution drafted by the Constituent Assembly on September 20, 2015.The Nepal government is organising a grand celebration in Kathmandu on September 19 to mark Constitution Day and has declared a public holiday for the occasion. President Ramchandra Paudel, Prime Minister Sushila Karki, the Nepal army chief, ministers and other dignitaries are scheduled to attend.","Deposed PM KP Sharma Oli has shifted from army protection to a private residence.

Nepal protesters delete social media presence as police probe closes in,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/nepal-protesters-delete-social-media-presence-as-police-probe-closes-in/articleshow/123984686.cms,"Nepal Lifts Social Media Ban Following Deadly Protests





With Nepal slowly regaining normalcy after the deadly Sept 8-9 protests that left more than 70 people dead, police have turned their focus to identifying those behind the violence. The crackdown has triggered a 'digital retreat' among many protesters, who are deleting social media accounts or going silent online to avoid detection.Nepal police said they have received nearly 30,000 emails from citizens containing photos and videos that document arson, looting, and attacks on public buildings. The evidence was submitted after an appeal by police urging people to share digital material pertaining to the protests while promising not to disclose the identity of the senders to ensure their safety.DIG Binod Ghimire, spokesperson of Nepal police, said the huge volume of citizen responses received would aid the investigation. ""The videos and photos that we have got from citizens will help us track down those involved in the violence. We will analyse the data and act accordingly. We urge people to share more evidence, if any.""His statement came amid another appeal by Kathmandu police cautioning people against buying looted items.During the protests, many had looted valuables from banks, supermarkets, jewellery shops and other business establishments. Some perpetrators had also looted weapons and other items from police stations across the country.Earlier on Wednesday, ministers of the newly-formed interim govt visited the federal parliament building to assess the destruction. Rameshwor Prasad Khanal, the interim finance minister, said: ""The damage to properties is extensive across the country. We are assessing the loss after which necessary action would be taken to repair or rebuild properties. Our PM has already said that the vandalism and arson was a criminal act which will be punished. Police are therefore working towards bringing the perpetrators to justice.""Meanwhile, in Kathmandu, the sense of unease is palpable, especially among younger residents. Many say the fear of being linked to the unrest has changed everyday routines. ""Youngsters are now not just hesitant to come out of their homes but have also deleted their social media accounts,"" said Prashant Shrestha, who runs a souvenir shop in Thamel. ""There's fear of being identified for the loot and vandalism that caused so much loss to both public and private property. ""Ram Bahadur Chhetri, 64, a retired govt employee, termed the vandalism as a 'brainless act' while demanding strict action against perpetrators. ""Our country had somehow managed to get back on its feet after the 2015 earthquake . Now, again some people under the garb of protests against corruption, caused unforgettable damage. It will take years for us to cope with this loss,"" said Chhetri.","Nepal police have received nearly 30,000 emails from citizens containing photos and videos that document arson, looting, and attacks on public buildings.
