CBI HIDING RAPISTS: Shocking Cover-up Allegation by RG Kar Victim's Father, Vows to Reveal Truth

Poll Do you believe that the woman's complaint about the alleged assault was misleading? Yes No





PUNE: Police commissioner Amitesh Kumar said on Sunday that a fake narrative about the city's ""collapsing law and order"" situation was being built based on an ""entirely false and misleading complaint of a very serious nature"" authorities had received recently.Kumar did not specify the nature of the complaint while speaking at the inauguration of a new police chowkey under the Sinhagad Road police station. However, his observation came against the backdrop of a 22-year-old woman's complaint that an unidentified delivery agent entered her 11th-floor flat in Pune last Wednesday, sprayed some chemical to render her unconscious, and raped her. She had also alleged that the man used her cellphone to take a selfie and keyed in a threat message, ‘I will come back'.Also read: Top cop says 22-year-old woman filed false complaint; tried to portray city as unsafe ""However, our teams busted the same within 24 hours by establishing that the complaint given by the woman was entirely false and misleading and tended to hide information from police,"" Kumar told TOI later.He added: ""There is a part of consent in the case, and this consent we have already established. The woman called her friend to her house. The selfie was clicked with her consent, which she later edited. The woman complained to the police about an unknown courier delivery person, which is not the case.Secondly, she stated that there was forceful entry and use of spray before she was raped, and that too turned out to be misleading. The investigations have also revealed the two had some arguments following which the woman lodged the misleading complaint.""Deputy commissioner of police (Zone V), Rajkumar Shinde, said: ""We have received her medical report from the Sassoon General Hospital. However, these reports are inconclusive.""The woman holds a BE (data science) degree and works with an IT company in Kalyaninagar. Her complaint created a major uproar across the country before the police established there were discrepancies in her account.Also read: No forced entry, no use of spray, selfie with consent, says top cop; friend detained based on phone location Investigators also said she herself wrote the threat message after the friend left her flat.On Saturday, the police got her to record her statement before a Judicial Magistrate First Class in view of the frequent changes she kept making in the narration of the incident. This was also after she and her friend were made to sit in front of each other and questioned. She has also been referred to counselling. Referring to these events as ""a very serious complaint"" received by the authorities, Kumar noted that a fake narrative was being constructed, one alleging that Pune's law and order systems were ""collapsing"".Officials from Kondhwa police on Saturday also recorded the statement of a woman professor with a private engineering college who was in touch with the woman before the registration of the rape complaint, they said.""The professor is the complainant's friend and guide and was in touch with the complainant on Wednesday. During investigations, we realised that the complainant had sought all the directions from the professor to lodge her complaint and on how to deal with investigating authorities,"" Shinde said.""If required, we will question the professor again. We have recorded the woman professor's statement as part of the investigation in the case,"" he added.","Police commissioner Amitesh Kumar said a fake narrative was being built based on an ""entirely false and misleading complaint of a very serious nature"" Kumar did not specify the nature of the complaint while speaking at the inauguration of a new police chowkey under the Sinhagad Road police station.

NEW DELHI: Social media influencer and actor Rajshree More on Monday evening shared details of the incident that has highlighted the hooliganism of MNS in that state.She accused Rahil Shaikh , the 26-year-old son of MNS leader Javed Shaikh, of abusing, threatening, and attempting to assault her after a road accident in Mumbai's Andheri West.The video posted by More has sparked outrage, in which Shaikh can be seen shirtless and visibly drunk. He hurled threats and slurs at More when she confronted him after his vehicle rammed into hers twice.""He told me, 'Tujhe pata hai main kaun hoon? Mera baap kaun hai?

He abused me even before the Police and tried to even hit me,"" she said.She further asked, if her vehicle was hit once, why did he dare to hit it for another time?""When my vehicle was hit once, he could have left. Why was it twice? My vehicle is very famous. People know me and my vehicle.

Opposition united in SC on SIR: 'Will snatch votes of lakhs',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-united-in-sc-on-sir-will-snatch-votes-of-lakhs/articleshow/122305802.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear challenges by Congress and and 10 other opposition parties, including DMK and NCP (Sharad Pawar), to the Election Commission 's decision for special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar.Appearing before a bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and Joymalya Bagchi, senior advocates Kapil Sibal, A M Singhvi and Gopal Sankarnarayanan pleaded to the court to grant an urgent hearing as the revision process had already started and lakhs would be disenfranchised if the exercise was not stayed. They said the squeezed timeline fixed by the EC was impractical and it was impossible to complete the process in such a short span of time. After a brief hearing, the apex court agreed to examine their plea and posted it for Thursday (July 10). Bihar elections are likely to be held in November.The petitions have been filed on behalf of Congress, NCP (Sharad Pawar), CPI, CPM, CPI (ML), DMK, SP, Shiv Sena (UBT), JMM and RJD. Besides, TMC MP Mahua Moitra, NGOs - Association for Democratic Reforms and People's Union for Civil Liberties - and a few residents of Bihar have also filed petitions against the EC's drive.The petitioners took the identical stand that the timeline fixed by EC was not practical and would lead to disenfranchisement of lakhs of voters, particularly migrant workers and people from marginalised communities who do not have requisite documents and may not be able to procure it within the short span fixed by EC.Congress general secretary KC Venugopal posted on X: “It (SIR) has wreaked havoc across villages and towns of Bihar — giving crores of voters anxiety about whether their right to vote will be stolen. This is mass-scale rigging and mischief being carried out by EC, under instructions from ruling regime.”RJD MP Manoj Jha sought direction to EC to conduct the forthcoming polls in Bihar on the basis of the existing electoral rolls. Though at present SIR is confined to Bihar, parties apprehend that it could be replicated in other states too. Moitra urged SC to restrain EC for undertaking such an exercise.“The impugned order is discriminatory, unreasonable and manifestly arbitrary and violates Articles 14, 21, 325 and 326. The order is a tool of institutionalised disenfranchisement. It is submitted that it is being used to justify aggressive and opaque revisions of electoral rolls that disproportionately target Muslim, Dalit and poor migrant communities, as such, they are not random patterns but it is engineered exclusions. The present SIR process is not only hasty and ill-timed, but has the effect of disenfranchising crores of voters, thereby robbing them of their constitutional right to vote. Moreover, this exercise has been launched during monsoon season in Bihar, when many districts are affected by floods and local population is displaced, thereby making it difficult and almost impossible for a large section of population to meaningfully participate in the process,” Jha said in his plea.Seeking the court’s direction to set aside the EC’s order, Moitra in her petition, filed through advocate Neha Rathi, submitted that the order unlawfully shifted the burden of proving eligibility from the state to the individual elector and arbitrarily excludes commonly accepted identity documents such as Aadhaar and ration cards.PUCL, in its petition through advocate Talha Abdul Rahman, questioned EC’s timing, alleging Bihar’s massive migrant population faces systematic exclusion as workers lacking local address proofs struggle with complex procedures from distant locations, possibly missing compressed timelines due to work commitments.","The Supreme Court agreed to hear challenges by Congress and and 10 other opposition parties, including DMK and NCP (Sharad Pawar), to the Election Commission's decision for special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar. They said the squeezed timeline fixed by the EC was impractical and it was impossible to complete the process in such a short span of time.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122305822,imgsize-851775,width-400,resizemode-4/122305822.jpg"

ROHTAK: A 35-year-old woman has alleged she was gang-raped by four men in the vacant coach of a stationary train in Panipat on the night of June 24 and that another train severed one of her feet as she staggered about disoriented and traumatised.Speaking to the media on Monday, she described how a domestic dispute spiralled into a night of brutality for her and left her fighting for her life.According to the survivor, the ordeal began on June 24 when her husband allegedly beat her after she refused sexual relations.

Elon Musk's America Party: Laura Loomer predicts these people may join to spite Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/elon-musks-america-party-laura-loomer-predicts-these-people-may-join-to-spite-donald-trump/articleshow/122291639.cms,"ELON MUSK Forms New 'AMERICA PARTY', Declares War On Trump & Republicans | US News

Laura Loomer predicts defections to undermine Donald Trump

A bold move from Elon Musk

Cracks within the Republican base



Conservative activist Laura Loomer has reignited political tensions by claiming that several prominent conservatives may align with Elon Musk’s newly launched America Party, not necessarily out of shared ideology, but to undermine US President Donald Trump. Loomer’s remarks, shared publicly on social media, come in the wake of Musk’s official announcement of the America Party. Musk framed it as a bold alternative to the entrenched two-party system. The tech billionaire’s increasing political activity, combined with high-profile disagreements with Trump, is stirring speculation about a growing split on the American right.The timing of Loomer’s prediction is especially notable. It came just after President Trump signed off on the controversial “Big, Beautiful Bill,” a sweeping tax and spending package that drew criticism from fiscal conservatives and Musk alike. As ideological fault lines widen, Loomer’s comments reflect growing discontent within Republican ranks and hint at a possible political realignment ahead of 2026.Shortly after Musk’s announcement, Laura Loomer took to X (formerly Twitter) to make a striking prediction. She named Tucker Carlson, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (MTG), and Rep. Thomas Massie as potential defectors to Musk’s America Party, a move she believes would be aimed at undercutting Donald Trump’s influence. “I predict Tucker Carlson, MTG, and Thomas Massie will join the new ‘America Party’ to spite President Trump,” Loomer wrote.Loomer, a longtime Trump supporter known for her hardline views, has frequently called out fellow conservatives whom she believes are disloyal or politically opportunistic. Her latest comments add fuel to speculation about rising fault lines within the GOP.Elon Musk officially launched the America Party on July 4, declaring it a response to public frustration with the current political establishment. In a widely shared post, Musk wrote, ""By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it. Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.""His decision followed a public fallout with President Trump over the “Big, Beautiful Bill.” Musk had strongly opposed the legislation, criticizing its size and scope. His move to form a new party signals an effort to reshape the political conversation, particularly among conservatives dissatisfied with Trump-era policies.Tensions between Trump and various Republican figures have been escalating, especially over issues like government spending and party direction. Rep. Thomas Massie, a libertarian-leaning Republican from Kentucky, has frequently clashed with Trump, including during the pandemic when he opposed Covid relief packages. Trump once referred to him as a “pathetic loser.”Marjorie Taylor Greene, although once a close Trump ally, has recently voiced support for some of Musk’s positions. Tucker Carlson, meanwhile, has maintained a complicated relationship with Trump and may be open to political shifts that align with his populist brand. Loomer’s naming of these figures underscores growing uncertainty about where influential conservatives will place their loyalty going forward.Whether or not Carlson, Greene, or Massie will formally align with the America Party remains to be seen. But the speculation itself is already shifting political dynamics, raising new questions about Trump’s grip on the GOP and whether Musk can truly disrupt the conservative power structure.As the 2026 elections approach, the right is poised for internal battles that may define its future. One thing is clear. Elon Musk is no longer just a disruptor in tech. He is now a force reshaping the landscape of American politics.","Conservative activist Laura Loomer predicts defections to undermine Donald Trump.

Texas flash floods have claimed at least 82 lives, with numerous other holiday visitors and campers still missing after torrential rains triggered a rapid and devastating rise in water levels. Kerr County emerged as the worst-hit region as nearly 12 inches of rain fell early Friday morning during an overnight storm, causing the Guadalupe River to surge 26 feet in just 45 minutes. The disaster unfolded over the holiday weekend, catching many off guard and overwhelming campsites, roads, and riverside communities.This tragedy underscores a stark reality: flash floods are the deadliest weather hazard in the United States, surpassing hurricanes and tornadoes in annual fatalities. The National Weather Service reports an average of over 125 flood-related deaths each year. As communities continue to reel from this latest disaster, it becomes yet another entry in a long history of devastating US floods from Hurricane Katrina to Superstorm Sandy that reveal the escalating threat of extreme weather events. Here are the 10 most disastrous flood events in the US in the last 25 years that will shake you.The Texas Hill Country flood now adds to the growing list of flood disasters that have devastated parts of the US Here’s a closer look at some of the most severe flood events in the US:O ne of the most recent deadly events, Hurricane Helene tore through Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, and Virginia in September 2024. The storm caused around 250 fatalities, most of which were due to inland flooding, not wind.North Carolina alone reported 108 deaths, and entire Appalachian communities were left cut off from electricity, communications, and vital supplies. It was the deadliest hurricane since Katrina in 2005.In July 2022, relentless rainfall triggered catastrophic flooding in eastern Kentucky, killing 45 people, according to the Associated Press.Meteorologists noted that the floods destroyed entire neighborhoods, schools, water systems, and roadways. Thousands of residents lost their homes and belongings overnight, marking one of the worst natural disasters in Kentucky’s history.A staggering 17 inches of rain fell within 24 hours in Waverly, Tennessee, in August 2021. The resulting flood claimed 20 lives, including young twin babies swept from their father’s arms. The rapid rise in water levels overwhelmed communities, destroying homes, vehicles, and businesses.One of the most infamous recent disasters, Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas as a Category 4 hurricane, then stalled, releasing historic rainfall over Houston and surrounding areas. The National Hurricane Center reported 68 deaths, with the vast majority caused by freshwater flooding. Harvey resulted in over $125 billion in damages and destroyed more than 300,000 structures.A seemingly mild rainstorm turned deadly in June 2016, as flooding swept through West Virginia. The flood killed 23 people and left dozens stranded.The event exposed vulnerabilities in emergency preparedness and infrastructure across the state.Superstorm Sandy was a powerful hybrid system that struck the East Coast in October 2012. The storm caused 147 deaths, 72 of which occurred in the USMost fatalities were attributed to drowning, and massive storm surges flooded subways, damaged homes, and left millions without power, especially in New York and New Jersey.In the spring of 2011, excessive rainfall and record snowmelt caused widespread flooding across the Mississippi River Basin, resulting in 24 deaths across multiple states including Oklahoma, Missouri, and Louisiana. Communities were overwhelmed as levees were breached and emergency systems failed under pressure.Striking the Texas Gulf Coast in September 2008, Hurricane Ike produced a 20-foot storm surge in Galveston and dumped torrential rains on Houston.The storm killed over 100 people, many due to floodwaters, and severely damaged homes, roads, and vehicles.The deadliest and costliest flood disaster in US history, Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005.When levees broke, entire neighborhoods were submerged, forcing rooftop rescues. The death toll reached nearly 1,400 people, with damages exceeding $200 billion. The event remains a stark reminder of the catastrophic consequences of flood mismanagement and climate vulnerability.In June 2001, Tropical Storm Allison stalled over Texas and Louisiana, unloading over 40 inches of rain in parts of Houston. The prolonged deluge caused 41 deaths, with extensive damage to homes, businesses, and city infrastructure. The storm left tens of thousands stranded as emergency services struggled to respond.From Texas to Kentucky and New Orleans to New Jersey, the destructive force of flash floods has reshaped communities, taken lives, and cost the nation hundreds of billions of dollars.","Flash floods are the deadliest weather hazard in the United States, surpassing hurricanes and tornadoes in annual fatalities.

DEHRADUN: An elderly woman is battling for her life after two Rottweilers owned by a neighbour leapt over a boundary wall and mauled her while she was walking to a local temple in Dehradun's Rajpur area, police said on Monday.Kaushalya Devi, 66, suffered deep lacerations to her head, hands, legs and ear, as well as fractures in two bones, and required nearly 200 stitches. The domestic help managed to bring the dogs back inside following the attack.Devi was initially treated at Shri Mahant Indresh Hospital before being referred to another facility for surgery on her hand and ear, which was almost ripped off in the attack, which occurred around 4am on Sunday.Nafees Ahmed, owner of the dogs, had left them at the house of his friend, Mohammed Zaid, from where the dogs had pounced at the woman. At the time of the incident, Zaid was not present at the house and only a domestic help was there.Ahmed has been detained by police for questioning while Zaid was charged under BNS section 291 (negligent conduct with respect to animals). A police probe is on. Sub-inspector Mukesh Negi, who is overseeing the investigation, said Devi's son, Umang Nirwal, filed a complaint at Rajpur police station.Dehradun SSP Ajai Singh said Ahmed was detained and brought to the police station for questioning. ""We found that Ahmed didn't have the required license from the Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) to keep the dogs as pets. We will record Devi's statement once her health permits, and more criminal sections could be added in the case, if needed.""He added that following incidents of attacks on people by pet dogs of dangerous breeds, the department of animal husbandry and dairy under the Central govt had earlier banned the import or breeding of dogs of certain breeds deemed dangerous, including Rottweiler, Cane Corso, Kangal, Pitbull, Pitbull Terrier, Dogo Argentino and Wolfdog.""If any resident in the city is experiencing problems due to dogs of these breeds kept as pet by people in his/her neighbourhood, then they can inform police by calling the emergency number of 112, nearby police station or the DMC office for necessary action,"" added Singh.The incident has created widespread outrage in the local community.Residents and corporator Sanjay Nautiyal met Singh and mayor Saurabh Thapliyal to demand strict legal action against Ahmed and Zaid, noting that the same dogs had allegedly attacked four other people previously.Nautiyal told TOI, ""In earlier instances, Ahmed either threatened the victims or arranged settlements to avoid police complaints. This time, too, he dismissed their concerns, daring them to take action.""","Kaushalya Devi, 66, suffered deep lacerations to her head, hands, legs and ear, as well as fractures in two bones.

‘What will happen to me if the monster gets out of jail?’: Kolkata college rape survivor 'extremely scared' of Monojit Mishra; campus reopens but scars remain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/what-will-happen-to-me-if-the-monster-gets-out-of-jail-kolkata-college-rape-survivor-extremely-scared-of-monojit-mishra-campus-reopens-but-scars-remain/articleshow/122309346.cms,"(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)





KOLKATA: As the Kolkata law college reopened under heavy police security on Monday, the survivor of the June 25 gang rape continued to live in fear — haunted not only by the trauma of the assault but also by the thought of her accused attacker walking free.“She keeps asking me just one question: ‘What will happen to me if the monster (prime accused Monojit Mishra) gets out of jail?’” her father told TOI on the day the campus opened for the first time since the incident. “She is still in severe trauma,” he added, revealing how deeply the fear of Mishra continues to torment his daughter.While the administration and faculty returned to campus duty, many admitted that the scars left behind by the brutal incident were far from healed. One professor acknowledged the institution's collective failure to ensure student safety, saying, “No one can avoid responsibility.”The survivor’s family is now focused on two priorities: helping her cope with the trauma and ensuring that justice is served. “We want to refrain from commenting on the court’s decision (after the trial is over) but we strongly believe that the culprit and his associates should receive the maximum possible punishment,” her father said.Meanwhile, police investigations have intensified. The detective department has identified serious discrepancies in the college’s attendance and visitor registers. Statements from 56 individuals have been recorded so far, with 18 considered crucial — several of whom are likely to become key witnesses.Investigators revealed that the main accused, Monojit Mishra, allegedly misused his influence on campus. Documents related to his appointment, salary, and role in the college have been seized.“Our probe has found that several basic college rules were violated on June 25. Witnesses confirmed that many of these violations were carried out under Mishra’s instructions,” said a senior police officer.Security guard Pinaki Banerjee, one of the arrested accused, told police that Mishra had ordered the removal of the campus visitor register.Banerjee also claimed that Mishra had threatened security personnel repeatedly over maintaining records. The register, intended to record the entry of all visitors, was reportedly discontinued on Mishra’s direct orders.Police have arrested Mishra, his two associates — Pramit Mukherjee and Zaib Ahmed — and Banerjee in connection with the crime. The survivor was allegedly dragged into the college’s union room and then to the security guard’s quarters, where the assault took place.","The victim's father says she is haunted by the thought of her accused attacker walking free.

MUMBAI: Social media influencer and businesswoman, Rajshree More, has accused the son of a Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) functionary of intimidation, abuse and threats, after he allegedly rammed his SUV into her car in Mumbai’s Andheri West while driving under the influence.The accused, Rahil Javed Shaikh (26), son of Javed Shaikh, a senior MNS leader from Thane, was seen shirtless in viral videos, hurling vulgar abuses and invoking his political connections, in the presence of police officers.The incident took place around 1.30am on Monday, after Shaikh left a party at a friend’s house in Lokhandwala.According to the FIR registered at Amboli Police Station, Shaikh was driving an Innova SUV in an intoxicated state when he collided with More’s Jeep Compass. He initially fled the spot, but was intercepted shortly after. More, who filmed the incident, said she was stunned by his aggression and his repeated references to his father’s political position.In her statement, More said, “I was targeted because, despite being a Maharashtrian, I raised my voice for people from different backgrounds who come here to work hard. They called me ‘Vibhishan’ for speaking up in support of migrant workers.”More alleged that Shaikh told her: “Tujhe pata hai main kaun hoon? Mera baap kaun hai? Main MNS se hoon (Do you know who I am? My father is in MNS).” She added that he even told her to approach Raj Thackeray’s house for compensation for the damages caused to her vehicle.“When he hit my vehicle once, he could have left. Why twice? My car is well-known, people recognise it. Why was it specifically my vehicle, and why was there an MNS person inside?” she asked.“He abused me in front of the police and tried to hit me. Where am I safe?”More also claimed that a group of around 200 people had earlier visited her studio, demanding an apology for her past remarks supporting labourers from other states.“They threatened to destroy my studio if I didn’t apologise. I am scared of these people. Ek Marathi ladki ko hi ye Marathi waale target kar rahe hain (These very Marathi people are targeting a Marathi girl),” she said.Police have booked Rahil Shaikh under sections pertaining to rash and negligent driving, criminal intimidation, outraging a woman’s modesty, and drunk driving. His vehicle has been impounded, and an on-site breathalyser test showed his blood alcohol level was over the legal limit. A blood sample has been sent to a forensic lab to confirm alcohol levels.","Social media influencer and businesswoman, Rajshree More, has accused the son of a Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) functionary of intimidation, abuse and threats.

When Elon Musk said 'Would not eat omelettes for a week'

The US Air Force has halted its proposed collaboration with Elon Musk 's SpaceX to test hypersonic rocket cargo deliveries from Johnston Atoll, a remote Pacific wildlife refuge, according to Stars and Stripes, an independent US military publication. The decision, as reported by Reuters, highlights concerns from Biologists and experts that the project would endanger numerous seabirds nesting on the unincorporated American territory, located nearly 800 miles (1,300 km) southwest of Hawaii.The Air Force had planned an environmental assessment, but opposition from environmental groups delayed the draft's release. A military spokesperson told Stars and Stripes recently that the Air Force is now seeking alternative locations for the program, which aims to use commercial rockets, like those developed by SpaceX, to deliver up to 100 tons of cargo anywhere on Earth in about 90 minutes—a potential game-changer for military logistics in remote areas. Neither the Air Force nor SpaceX immediately responded to requests for comment.Biologists warn that the one-square-mile (2.6 square km) atoll, part of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, supports 14 species of tropical birds that could be severely impacted by the project.SpaceX has faced similar environmental issues before. Last year, a Starship rocket launch in Boca Chica, Texas, destroyed nests and eggs of protected plover shorebirds, leading to legal repercussions. In response, Elon Musk had said that he would ""not eat omelets for a week"" to atone for the incident, a remark that drew attention to the environmental controversy surrounding his company's activities. ""To make up for this heinous crime, I will refrain from having omelette for a week,"" Elon Musk wrote.Elon Musk made the pledge in response to an article published in an American newspaper highlighting the environmental impact of the SpaceX launch.",The US Air Force has halted its proposed collaboration with Elon Musk's SpaceX to test hypersonic rocket cargo deliveries from Johnston Atoll.

An unusual bee attack in the French town of Aurillac injured 24 people on Sunday morning, as reported by ABC news. Three of the victims were in critical condition but have since improved, local officials said.Lt Col Michel Cayla, head of the local fire service, said he had never seen anything like it. He described the scene as dramatic because of the number of people hurt, the panic it caused and the seriousness of some injuries.“In terms of the number of victims, the panic among the people and the severity of some of the injuries, it was impressive,” he told broadcaster TF1.According to the Prefecture of Cantal office, the attack lasted around 30 minutes. People walking in the area were stung repeatedly. Firefighters and medical teams quickly arrived to help the injured, while police set up a safety perimeter until the bees calmed down.The three people in critical condition were rushed to a local hospital. Aurillac’s mayor, Pierre Mathonier, told broadcaster BFM TV on Monday that all three were now in better condition.One of them, a 78-year-old, had suffered cardiac arrest and had to be revived.The mayor said this person is now stable, while the other two are in good health.The mayor suggested the bees may have become aggressive after Asian hornets, a type of large wasp tried to attack their hive. The hive had been on the roof of a hotel in the town centre for over 10 years. The hive has since been removed and relocated outside the town by a beekeeper.","24 people injured in bee attack in French town of Aurillac.

Following Donald Trump's announcement of 25 per cent tariffs on goods from Japan and South Korea, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Tuesday said his government would hold discussions with the Trump administration for a deal to benefit both Japan and the United States.Ishiba also cautioned that ""hasty decisions"" should not be made.""I chaired the Comprehensive Response Headquarters for US Tariff Measures.

"Brics 2025: 'We don't want an emperor,' says Brazil's Lula; slams Trump tariffs, hints at dollar alternative",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/brics-2025-we-dont-want-an-emperor-says-brazils-lula-slams-trump-tariffs-hints-at-dollar-alternative/articleshow/122309141.cms,"AP photo





Brazilian President Lula da Silva took a sharp dig at Donald Trump as the Brics summit wrapped up on Monday: ""The world has changed. We don't want an emperor"".His words came just hours after the US President took to his familiar playbook of tariff threats, warning the bloc of extra duties if they took what he branded as ""anti-American"" positions. The warning? A 10 per cent tariff against Brics nations -- unless, of course, they looked for their interest rather than American interest!In his trade salvo on Sunday night, Trump said that this administration was preparing to finalise dozens of bilateral deals before a self-imposed July 9 deadline. But the developing powers weren't biting.""This is a set of countries that wants to find another way of organising the world from the economic perspective,"" Lula said, according to news agency Reuters, adding, ""I think that’s why the Brics are making people uncomfortable.""According to a source familiar with the matter, the White House isn’t planning to slap that 10 per cent tariff immediately. But if the bloc’s policies appear ""anti-American,"" the trigger could be pulled.At the Rio summit’s close, Lula doubled down on his call for a diversified global economy. He took aim at the dollar’s dominance in international trade, saying: “The world needs to find a way that our trade relations don't have to pass through the dollar.”“Obviously, we have to be responsible about doing that carefully. Our central banks have to discuss it with central banks from other countries,” he clarified. “That’s something that happens gradually until it’s consolidated.”In February, Trump had already warned of “100 per cent tariffs” on the Brics nations if they dared undermine the dollar’s role. That same threat seems to have cooled the bloc’s ambitions for a common currency, an idea floated last year but quietly parked under Brazil’s current presidency.Other Brics members offered a more diplomatic response to Trump’s outburst.South African president Cyril Ramaphosa said the bloc “does not seek to compete with any other power,” and voiced optimism about reaching a trade understanding with the US.Over in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning was characteristically measured: “Tariffs should not be used as a tool for coercion and pressuring,” she said, noting that the Brics favours “win-win cooperation” and “does not target any country.”The Kremlin, for its part, reminded reporters that its work within the Brics reflects a ""common world view"" that ""will never be directed against third countries"".Without naming the US, the Brics group in Rio, including India, raised ""serious concerns"" about the rise of tariffs which it said were “inconsistent with WTO (World Trade Organisation) rules.”The restrictions “threaten to reduce global trade, disrupt global supply chains, and introduce uncertainty,"" the group said in a statement even as there was confusion even in Washington about the efficacy of the Trump approach.","Lula da Silva: ""The world has changed.

Far-right voices like Jack Posobiec and Alex Jones slammed the decision as a cover-up, while Elon Musk mocked Pam Bondi with clown memes for backtracking on her claims about a “client list.”Before the memo's release, Kash Patel and Dan Bongino were among the leading voices promoting conspiracy theories about Epstein.Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former assistant, is the only associate criminally charged in connection with his crimes.

NEW DELHI: Police detained Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) local leader Avinash Jadhav early Tuesday morning ahead of a planned rally in Thane to counter traders' protests against MNS members slapping a food stall owner for not speaking Marathi. The proposed rally by Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti in Mira Bhayander area was denied police permission.Police officials issued orders restricting Jadhav, who serves as MNS's Thane and Palghar head, from entering the Mira Bhayander area. He was taken into custody from his Thane residence around 3.30am, according to news agency PTI.The Raj Thackeray-led MNS shared a video of Jadhav's detention on social media platforms. Security measures were increased in the Mira Bhayander area due to the proposed rally.The incident that sparked the controversy occurred on July 1, when MNS activists slapped a food stall owner in Bhayander for not speaking Marathi. A viral video showed some attackers wearing scarves with MNS symbols asking the stall owner to speak in Marathi, leading to an altercation and assault.Seven MNS members were temporarily detained and released after receiving police notices. Police filed a case against them under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita for rioting, threatening, and assault.Local traders in Bhayander area organized a protest demanding action against those who assaulted the food stall owner. In response, MNS planned a counter-rally.Mira Bhayander-Vasai Virar Deputy Commissioner of Police Prakash Gaikwad issued a prohibitory order on Monday preventing Jadhav from entering the area.""As Jadhav's move to come to Bhayander may aggravate the situation and give rise to law and order problems, his entry into the area has been prohibited for a day,"" stated Gaikwad in the order.The police order noted that Jadhav had 28 cases of cognizable offenses registered against him at various police stations.MNS members have been actively campaigning for increased use of the Marathi language in commercial establishments and banks throughout Maharashtra.","Avinash Jadhav was taken into custody from his Thane residence around 3.30am.

Why MacArthur Park chosen as the target?



What feds said?



Hegseth Rolls Eyes, Then Fires Off Wild Senate Response; ‘I Won’t Reveal, No Matter What…’ | WATCH





Dozens of heavily armed federal officers and nearly 90 National Guard troops descended on Los Angeles’ MacArthur Park on Monday (local time) in what was billed as an immigration raid but ended up looking more like a military spectacle in a nearly empty public space.With troops on horseback and military vehicles in tow, the operation sparked outrage from city officials, including mayor Karen Bass, who likened the scene to “a city under siege” and slammed it as a “political stunt.”“What I saw in the park today looked like a city under siege, under armed occupation,” AP reported quoting Bass.Questioning the motive behind such an act, Bass said, “The world needs to see the troop formation on horses walking through the park, in search of what? In search of what? They’re walking through the area where the children play.”Children in a nearby day camp were quickly moved indoors, with one 8-year-old telling the mayor he was “fearful of ICE.”The operation took place in LA’s MacArthur Park, a vibrant, immigrant-rich neighborhood dubbed the “Ellis Island of the West Coast.” Health workers assisting homeless residents said troops pointed guns at them and ordered them to leave. The park, known for its lake, concerts, soccer games, and bustling street vendors, is a cultural hub for immigrant families and small businesses.Council member Eunisses Hernandez, whose district covers MacArthur Park, said the area was singled out by the administration specifically because of ""who lives there and what it represents.”MacArthur Park, originally a 35-acre dump turned into Westlake Park in the late 19th century, was renamed in 1942 after General Douglas MacArthur. Since the 1980s, the surrounding Westlake neighborhood has grown into a densely populated immigrant community, home to many from Mexico, Central America, and immigrant advocacy groups.In recent years, it has seen an increase in homeless encampments, with outreach teams providing support for addiction. The park was also the site of a major 2007 May Day immigration rally that ended in police violence, leading to a $12.8 million settlement for protesters.Defense officials said the raid wasn’t a military operation, though they admitted the scale of the National Guard’s presence might give that impression.“It’s just going to be more overt and larger than we usually participate in,” AP quoted an official saying.According to the official, the main responsibility of the service members was to provide security for immigration officers in the event of a hostile crowd. While they were not involved in law enforcement actions like making arrests, they could temporarily hold individuals if needed until law enforcement took over.Deploying soldiers to provide security during the raids brings them closer than ever to direct involvement in law enforcement activities like deportations, something Trump has pledged as part of his hardline immigration agenda.","The operation was billed as an immigration raid but ended up looking more like a military spectacle in a nearly empty public space.

Continued Russian attacks:

Ukraine calls for more aid:





US President Donald Trump said on Monday (local time) that the United States will need to send more weapons to Ukraine, just days after ordering a pause in critical arms shipments to Kyiv.""We are going to send some more weapons (to Ukraine)...They have to be able to defend themselves. They are getting hit very hard...So many people are dying in that mess"", he said.Speaking to reporters about additional weapons deliveries for Ukraine, he said, “We have to. They have to be able to defend themselves.”His comments marked an apparent change in position after the Pentagon last week announced it would hold back deliveries of air defence missiles, precision-guided artillery and other weapons over concerns that its own stockpiles have declined too much.The sudden pause in shipments of Patriot missiles, precision-guided rockets, Hellfire missiles, Howitzer rounds and other weapons surprised Ukrainian officials and allies. The pause came at a challenging time for Ukraine, which is facing frequent air attacks from Russia in more than three-year-old war.Trump has said he is determined to end the conflict quickly, a promise he made during his presidential campaign. On Monday evening, at a White House dinner with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , he expressed frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin “I’m not happy with President Putin at all,” Trump said.Meanwhile, Russian attacks on Ukraine killed at least 11 civilians and injured more than 80 others on Monday, including seven children, Ukrainian officials said.Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia launched more than 100 drones at civilian targets overnight. Over the past week alone, Russia has fired around 1,270 drones, 39 missiles and nearly 1,000 powerful glide bombs at Ukraine.Ukraine’s Army Command said Russian drones also targeted military mobilization centres for the third time in five days, in an apparent attempt to disrupt recruitment.Ukraine has urged the United States and Europe to send more military support, especially after the sudden halt of promised US shipments.White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Monday the pause was part of a “standard review of all weapons and all aid” provided to all countries.Leavitt said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the global review of weapons and aid to ensure that “everything that’s going out the door aligns with America’s interests.”President Zelenskyy said Ukraine had signed new deals with European allies and a leading US defence company to ramp up drone production, aiming to secure “hundreds of thousands” more drones this year.“Air defense is the main thing for protecting life,” Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram on Monday. That includes developing and manufacturing interceptor drones that can stop Russia’s long-range Shahed drones, he said.","US President Donald Trump said on Monday that the United States will need to send more weapons to Ukraine.

Former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina Sentenced to Jail For Six Months by International Crimes Tribunal





DHAKA: The charge of ""crimes against humanity"" is inapplicable to former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina as the cases she is being tried for are part of a political conflict and not a war, her state-appointed lawyer argued on Monday in the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), which has set July 10 for framing charges against her and two of her close aides.Stating that according to the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act, 1973, only acts committed during war can be prosecuted as ""crimes against humanity"", Hasina's counsel Amir Hossain sought exemption for the Awami League politician, who is being tried in absentia. Hossain is also representing former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal and former inspector general of police Chowdhury Abdullah al Mamun in the case.""The events stemmed from political change, violence and revenge,"" Hossain told the ICT, which was formed after the 1971 war to try those accused of war crimes. ""Since no war occurred, the charges based on war crimes and crimes against humanity are inapplicable,"" he said. Rejecting the arguments, chief prosecutor Tajul Islam said allegations' merits will be assessed during formal trial once ICT decides on framing charges. ""I sought discharge from all allegations... as they appear politically motivated,"" Hossain told reporters, adding he has not been able to contact Hasina directly.",Former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina is being tried in absentia for crimes against humanity.

The Trump administration has deported eight migrants to South Sudan, a US department of homeland security official confirmed, after plans to initially send them to a base in Djibouti were called off.""A district judge cannot dictate the national security and foreign policy of the United States of America,"" assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told ABC News. ""This Independence Day marks another victory for the safety and security of the American people.""The aircraft arrived in South Sudan shortly before midnight on Friday.The eight migrants, whom the department of homeland security alleges have serious criminal convictions, were previously involved in a lawsuit that temporarily halted their deportation to South Sudan, redirecting them instead to a US military base in Djibouti.According to court filings, conditions at the US military base in Djibouti were difficult for both the detainees and the ICE officials assigned to guard them.The case reached the US supreme court, which ruled in a 7-2 decision on Thursday that the Trump administration was not obligated to comply with a lower court order requiring the migrants to remain at the military facility while legal proceedings continued.The ruling marked another legal victory for the Trump administration in its ongoing effort to deport individuals to countries with which they have no direct ties, and where they could potentially face mistreatment.In an unsigned opinion, the US supreme court stated that, following its recent decision to remove judge-imposed due process requirements for third-country deportations, the government can no longer be held accountable for allegedly violating those protections.One of the attorneys representing the group of men described their deportation to South Sudan as “punitive and unconstitutional.”“Because of the supreme court's procedural ruling, these men were denied an opportunity to contest their deportations to South Sudan based on their fear of torture or death,” said Trina Realmuto in a statement to ABC News. “The US state department warns Americans against all travel to South Sudan, yet deported these men there without any due process. Make no mistake about it, these deportations were punitive and unconstitutional. ”",Eight migrants have been deported to South Sudan.

Confusion around his death







The US department of justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation concluded that there was no evidence that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was murdered, Axios reported on Monday citing a memo. It also said that the investigators found no indication that Epstein blackmailed powerful figures or maintained a “client list”.The memo noted that no further charges would be filed against others linked to Epstein’s case; his associate Ghislaine Maxwell is already serving a 20-year sentence for child sex trafficking and related crimes.The findings mark the first time Trump’s administration has officially pushed back against conspiracy theories surrounding Jeffrey Epstein’s activities and death, theories that had previously been promoted by the FBI’s top two officials before Trump appointed them to lead the bureau.As prominent voices in MAGA circles, Kash Patel (now FBI director) and Dan Bongino (now deputy director) were among those who once questioned the official account of Epstein’s death.Both Patel and Bongino have since said that Epstein died by suicide. Still, belief that Epstein’s crimes implicated powerful figures, and that he was murdered to cover them up, remains widespread online, especially on the right.Moreover, during Elon Musk's fall out with Trump last month, he accused the US president of being “in the Epstein files.”Trump responded by sharing a statement from former Epstein lawyer David Schoen, who said Trump wasn’t implicated in any crime. Musk later deleted his posts, admitting he “went too far.”The administration is releasing both raw and enhanced video footage showing no one entered the area of Epstein’s Manhattan prison cell on the night he died in 2019. The footage backs the medical examiner’s conclusion that Epstein’s death was a suicide, according to a two-page memo, according to Axios news report.""The FBI enhanced the relevant footage by increasing its contrast, balancing the color, and improving its sharpness for greater clarity and viewability,"" it reported quoting the memo.Investigators found ""no incriminating 'client list' "" of Epstein's, ""no credible evidence ... that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals,"" and no ""evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties,"" the memo added.(This is a top Google Trends topic)",The US department of justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation concluded that there was no evidence that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was murdered.

The old video of Melinda French Gates from 2022 in which Melinda called Jeffrey Epstein 'evil personified' went viral Monday after the US administration brought the curtains down on the Epstein case. In the interview, Melinda blamed Bill Gates' relationship with convicted pedophile Epstein as one of the reasons for their divorce. Melinda revealed in the CBS interview that she had met Epstein once, as she wanted to see who this person was.""And I regretted it the second I stepped in the door. He (Epstein) was abhorrent. He was evil personified. I had nightmares about it afterwards, so my heart breaks for these young women,"" Melinda said adding that she made it clear to Bill that she did not like Epstein and his association with Epstein at all.Melinda wrote about this experience in her memoir ""The Next Day"" that in 2019, NYT published a deeply disturbing article suggesting that Bill Gates had not only betrayed the marriage but also Melinda's values. NYT also reported that Epstein threatened to expose Bill's alleged affair with Russian bridge player Mila Antonova in 2017, after Bill declined to join Epstein’s multi-billion-dollar charitable fund with JPMorgan Chase.But Bill Gates was not accused of any sex offence and also expressed regret for his association with Epstein. ""In retrospect, I was foolish to spend any time with him. I think I was quite stupid. I thought it would help me with global health philanthropy. In fact, it failed to do that.

What is Epstein's non-existent client list?







White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt was grilled Monday at the press conference as she was asked to clarify what happened to Epstein's client list that Attorney General Pam Bondi said was sitting on her desk. The FBI and the DOJ announced that there is no evidence that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein blackmailed powerful figures based on a client list and there was no client list. The administration also concluded that Epstein committed suicide, dousing years of MAGA conspiracy theories that he was murdered in custody.Leavitt defended the FBI and the DOJ and said the administration is committed to ""lock up bad guys"" and already surpassed the Joe Biden's administration in doing so. The administration is committed to truth and transparency and that's why Patel and Bondi pledged to do an exhaustive review of all the files pertaining to the Epstein's crime and death.The materials that have not been released contain incredibly graphic child pornography, not appropriate for public consumption.Journalist Peter Doocy asked Leavitt about Pam Bondi's exact statement that Jeffrey Epstein's client list was sitting on her desk for review, but Leavitt said Bondi was referring to all the documents of the case, not particularly about the client list.Americans expected a list of Epstein's clients full of prominent people who used to visit Epstein's island and took part in sexual exploitation of underage girls. The expectations were built up by the Donald Trump administration as they promised a full disclosure of who all were involved with sex offender Epstein. Several prominent names like Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton already came up in other Epstein-related documents as there were piles of documents including contact books, flight logs, witness testimonies etc.But these celebrities were never linked to any wrongdoing that Epstein was convicted of and Americans expected a sensational revelations in this regard.Epstein's flight logs had the names of Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Alan Dershowitz, Naomi Campbell, Kevin Spacey, Stephen Hawking, Chris Tucker while Epstein's contact book had 1,000 names, including Donald Trump, Tony Blair, Rupert Murdoch etc.","The FBI and the DOJ announced that there is no evidence that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein blackmailed powerful figures based on a client list and there was no client list.

Trump FEASTS With Netanyahu As Texas Drowns | 'America First' Slammed Amid Flood Chaos





Bizarre conspiracy theories have surfaced on social media as Texas is reeling under a massive flood after Republican leader Marjorie Taylor Greene announced that she will be introducing a new bill that would tackle weather modification. This is based on conspiracy theories that the government or some secretive organizations are manipulating the weather, resulting in such sudden mishaps. These organizations are using aircraft to release chemicals or metals into the atmosphere, conspiracy theorists believe.This is not a new theory but Greene's post after the Texas flood in which more than 80 people were killed reinvigorates these theories as being behind the Texas flooding.Senator Ted Cruz Monday rubbished these theories and said there is zero evidence to support claims that anyone is manipulating the weather. ""The internet can be a strange place,"" Cruz said at a press conference this morning. ""People can come up with all sorts of crazy theories.""Ted Cruz said the authorities should have evacuated Camp Mystic, the Christian girls' camp on the banks of the Guadalupe River, was evacuated earlier.“We would evacuate those in the vulnerable areas, such as younger children in the cabins, we would evacuate them sooner and get them to higher ground if we could go back,” Cruz said at a press briefing in Kerr County, the hardest-hit area of Texas Hill Country and home to the famed camp for young girls. But Cruz said he did not want finger-pointing at this hour of tragedy.""You're dropping your little girl off at camp, your little boy off at camp. You're celebrating Independence Day. You know that your child is going to be swimming, and canoes, and horseback riding, and doing archery, and making lifetime friends,"" Cruz said. ""Then suddenly, it turns to tragedy.""""There's a time to have political fights. There's a time to disagree. This is not that time,"" Cruz said.

ISLAMABAD: Swat Valley and Gilgit-Baltistan — key cradles of the Indus river — are battling deadly floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), exposing Pakistan’s weak climate governance and the fragility of its disaster response.At least 72 people have died nationwide, including 14 in Swat and 23 in Astore (Gilgit-Baltistan) where a passenger bus plunged into a swollen river. Another 25 people were rescued from the surging Indus near Shadi Khan in Punjab’s Attock district.Swat’s flash floods were triggered by a GLOF in Kalam Mitaltan area, while accelerated glacier melt in Gilgit-Baltistan has swelled rivers such as the Hunza, Kunjrab, and Shimshal Braldu. In both regions, roads, bridges, and homes have been swept away, leaving mountain communities stranded.“No early warning systems, no modern rescue equipment – Swat is left to drown, again,” said Ambreen Ali, a local activist, echoing growing public frustration.Once a prized alpine tourist destination, Swat continues to reel from its past under Taliban rule (2007–2009). Despite a military-led recovery and donor-funded rebuilding, this summer’s floods have damaged rebuilt infrastructure, including hotels in Kalam and Bahrain and the Mankial bridge, a lifeline for remote villages.In Gilgit-Baltistan, floodwaters threaten power lines and roads in Diamer, Skardu, and Astore, while downstream provinces fear the Indus’s surging flow. In Sindh, farmers worry that floods – exacerbated by dam releases upstream – will drown their fields.The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) blames a 67% rainfall deficit last winter for intensifying water stress. With only 150 cubic meters of per capita water storage, Pakistan is among the most water-insecure countries globally, retaining just 10% of its river flows.But it’s not just Pakistan that’s vulnerable.India, which shares the Himalayan watershed and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan, faces similar climate pressures. The 2022 floods, which killed 1,700 in Pakistan and inundated Indian regions, underscored the shared ecological risks tied to glacial retreat and erratic monsoons.The IWT, signed in 1960, has come under renewed strain. India suspended the treaty on April 23, 2025 following a terrorist attack in Kashmir’s Pahalgam. This halted data-sharing on river flows, leaving Pakistan exposed during the monsoon season.Pakistan suspects India’s water infrastructure push – including the Shahpurkandi and Ujh dams – could further disrupt downstream flows. But India too faces its own water anxieties, including unilateral dam operations and growing glacier-related threats in its Himalayan catchments.Analysts warn that lack of coordination on flood management could have catastrophic consequences for both countries. Experts call for restoring data exchange under IWT, investing in joint watershed management, and building early warning systems. With over 3,000 glacial lakes in Pakistan alone, the risk of future GLOFs looms large.As Swat mourns its dead and Gilgit-Baltistan braces for more floods, the Indus – a lifeline for both nations – is turning into a symbol of shared peril.","At least 72 people have died nationwide, including 14 in Swat and 23 in Astore.

At least 72 people have been killed and over 130 injured in Pakistan as relentless monsoon rains and flash floods battered the country over the past ten days, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said on Monday.Since June 26, casualties have been reported across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan provinces. The NDMA has urged local administrations to remain on high alert and advised tourists to steer clear of vulnerable areas, warning that continued rainfall could lead to further flooding and road blockages.Emergency services were already on heightened alert after a tragic incident last month in which 17 members of the same family were swept away by the Swat River.Thirteen bodies were recovered, including eight children, while four people were rescued. Footage of the family stranded on a rooftop and pleading for help sparked public outrage and criticism of the delayed rescue response.Many of the recent deaths were caused by collapsing walls and roofs, as well as sudden floods in low-lying areas.Officials are concerned that worsening weather conditions could mirror the devastating 2022 floods, which killed over 1,700 people and submerged nearly a third of the country.The NDMA has said it cannot rule out the possibility of similar large-scale disasters this year.With a population of more than 240 million, Pakistan remains one of the most climate-vulnerable nations in the world. Scientists warn that climate change is driving a rise in both the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, putting millions at risk.Rescue operations are ongoing, and authorities have called on the public to remain cautious as the monsoon season continues to intensify.",At least 72 people have been killed and over 130 injured in Pakistan as relentless monsoon rains and flash floods battered the country over the past ten days.

Who is Tommy Robinson?







British far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has drawn fresh attention online after he posted on X ""Free Balochistan"". The post, shared with his more than one million followers on X (formerly Twitter), is the latest in a series of controversial statements from the 42-year-old figure known for his inflammatory views, legal troubles, and vocal presence on social media.Tensions are running high in Balochistan following a violent crackdown by authorities on a peaceful rally in Hub Chowki. The protest, organised by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), was held to denounce the extrajudicial killing of Zeeshan Zaheer, a BYC member from Panjgur, allegedly targeted by a state-backed death squad.The BYC reports that a large number of women, children, and families of forcibly disappeared persons had joined the rally. Despite the peaceful nature of the protest, security forces responded with aerial firing, tear gas shelling, and mass arrests once the demonstration ended. Among those detained were four women — Sadiya, Samina, Aseela, and Mehtab — and human rights activist Abdullah Baloch. More than 20 hours later, their whereabouts remain unknown, with no legal proceedings initiated.Robinson rose to prominence in the UK as the founder of the English Defence League (EDL), a far-right, anti-Islam group notorious for staging violent protests between 2009 and 2013.His activism has long focused on immigration, Islam, and what he describes as the failure of British authorities to confront crimes like grooming gang abuse.Over the years, he has been jailed for assault (2005), mortgage fraud (2014), and previous contempt of court offences (2019), the latter for filming defendants during a grooming gang trial and potentially jeopardising judicial proceedings.Robinson portrays himself as a whistleblower silenced by the state, gaining significant online backing, including from Elon Musk earlier this year, who reinstated Robinson’s X account and has echoed his claims about establishment failures in prosecuting child sexual exploitation cases.Musk had also advocated for his release from jail in January saying, ""Why is Tommy Robinson in a solitary confinement prison for telling the truth? He should be freed and those who covered up this travesty should take his place in that cell.""","British far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley- Lennon, has drawn fresh attention online after he posted on X ""Free Balochistan"" The post is the latest in a series of controversial statements from the 42-year- old figure known for his inflammatory views.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122293019,imgsize-10580,width-400,resizemode-4/122293019.jpg"
Pakistan's power struggle narrows to two men: Imran vs Munir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-power-struggle-narrows-to-two-men-imran-vs-munir/articleshow/122283924.cms,"Imran Khan and Asim Munir (R)

Pakistan Offers Full Military Tribute To 'Kargil War Hero' Whose Body It Refused To Accept Earlier





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political battlefield has narrowed to two poles: Field Marshal Asim Munir , the army chief whose influence spans parliament, the judiciary and diplomacy, and Imran Khan , the jailed former prime minister who, despite his incarceration in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, remains the most potent political force in the country, commanding the street, the diaspora, and a digital army keeping his voice alive.This week, Khan issued a call for nationwide agitation after the 10th of Muharram, aiming to reignite mass mobilisation just as Field Marshal Munir stands at the peak of his institutional authority. The move comes amid growing public frustration over inflation, repression, and a system many believe has been engineered to exclude the electorate’s will.Two weeks ago, Munir met US President Donald Trump at the White House, a discreet engagement confirmed by diplomatic sources. According to insiders, Imran Khan’s fate and Pakistan’s internal political stability were among the topics discussed, particularly in light of pressure from the overseas Pakistani diaspora.Soon after, the Supreme Court awarded the PTI’s reserved seats to the ruling PML-N-PPP coalition, handing it a two-thirds supermajority in parliament — a legal outcome that critics say has effectively nullified the popular mandate from the Feb 2024 general elections.“It’s political elimination through judicial procedure,” said a senior legal analyst. “The system was rewritten to fit the result.”While Munir tours Washington, Riyadh and Beijing as Pakistan’s stabilising envoy, PTI’s political campaign has been pushed abroad, led by a vast online network of digital volunteers across the UK, North America and the Gulf. “You can erase a party from parliament, but not from memory,” said a PTI organiser in Birmingham. “We’ve made the diaspora the movement’s backbone.”PTI’s message – injustice, censorship, stolen mandate – is kept alive through platforms like YouTube, Telegram and X, forming a digital frontline that defies state control.Munir’s rising global stature – reinforced by high-profile diplomatic engagements – may yet prove to be a deceptive calm. History offers a cautionary echo: Pakistan’s military rulers from Ayub to Zia to Musharraf all basked in international legitimacy at their zeniths, only to be brought down by domestic discontent.With Khan’s post-Muharram agitation call threatening to spill onto the streets and economic despair combining with political anger, Munir’s firm grip on the state may soon face its first real stress test. What looks like consolidation could quickly unravel if the tide of public rage surpasses the system’s capacity to contain it.There is no serious civilian counterweight. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif holds office but not authority. The real contest is between Munir with unmatched institutional control, and Imran, the politician with unbroken public appeal.Field Marshal Munir may rule the state. But Imran Khan – even from a prison cell – continues to shape the struggle that could decide Pakistan’s political future.","Imran Khan remains the most potent political force in the country, commanding the street, the diaspora, and a digital army keeping his voice alive.

Pakistan building collapse: 27 dead in Karachi including 3 children; rescue efforts continue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-building-collapse-27-dead-in-karachi-including-3-children-rescue-efforts-continue/articleshow/122281154.cms,"Pakistan Offers Full Military Tribute To 'Kargil War Hero' Whose Body It Refused To Accept Earlier





The death toll from the collapse of a five-storey residential building in Karachi’s Lyari area has risen to 27, according to officials quoted by Dawn on Sunday.Rescue teams continue to comb through the debris in search of survivors, days after the structure came crashing down near Lea Market on Fida Husain Shaikha Road.South deputy commissioner Javed Nabi Khoso said the rescue operation had continued overnight on Friday and was around 80 per cent complete by Saturday. Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan estimated that it would take another five to six hours to fully conclude the operation.Several individuals are still unaccounted for, though authorities say the exact number remains unclear as the search is ongoing.The Edhi Rescue Service confirmed that 27 bodies have been recovered so far, including nine women, 15 men and three children aged 13, 10 and one. Five people, among them three women, were also injured in the collapse. All victims were taken to Civil Hospital Karachi, and ten of the injured have since been treated and discharged.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said emergency teams were deployed swiftly after the incident and that the bodies have been returned to the victims’ families.He reaffirmed expectations that rescue efforts would conclude later in the day.Shah announced that a full investigation is underway, with committees already formed to examine the causes of the collapse. He revealed that over 480 buildings in Karachi’s older city areas, mostly in District South, have been declared dangerous.He also pledged government support for those displaced by the incident, promising assistance in securing alternative housing.The chief minister said the collapsed building appeared to be newly constructed and lacked the necessary approvals. He warned of strict action against those responsible for unauthorised construction and urged residents to confirm the clearance of buildings with the Building Control Authority before purchasing or renting.Acknowledging that financial struggles often force people into unsafe living conditions, Shah stressed the need for stronger enforcement and public awareness to ensure safety is not compromised.","The death toll from the collapse of a five-storey residential building in Karachi’s Lyari area has risen to 27, according to officials quoted by Dawn on Sunday.

KARACHI: The death toll from a collapsed multi-story residential building in southern Pakistan rose to 16 as search operations to find survivors continued for the second day.Rescuers pulled 10 more bodies from the rubble during an overnight operation, officials said Saturday.The govt-run Civil Hospital said in a statement it had received the 16 bodies, adding several of the injured had been hospitalised. Rescue workers are using heavy machinery to search for at least eight more survivors believed to be trapped under the debris, said emergency officials.Residents said the building was located on a narrow street, hampering efforts to bring in additional heavy equipment. Television footage showed rescuers removing debris as relatives of those still trapped cried and prayed for the safety of their loved ones.Building collapses are common in Pakistan, where construction standards are often poorly enforced. Many structures are built with substandard materials, and safety regulations are frequently ignored to cut costs. In June 2020, an apartment building collapsed in Karachi, killing 22.","Rescuers pull 10 more bodies from the rubble during an overnight operation.

Rescue teams in Pakistan continued to search for survivors on Saturday after a six-storey residential building collapsed in Karachi's Lyari neighbourhood, killing 16 people and injuring 13 others, according to local officials.The building came down around 10am on Friday in the Baghdadi area of Lyari, a densely populated and impoverished part of the city. Residents said they heard cracking sounds shortly before the collapse. Rescue workers, battling high heat and humidity, have been working through the night. At least eight people are still believed to be trapped under the debris.Summiaya Syed, a police surgeon with the provincial health department, confirmed the death toll at 16 and said 13 others had been injured.Dev Raj, 54, told AFP his daughter was still under the rubble. ""She was my beloved daughter. She was so sensitive, but is under the burden of debris. She got married just six months ago,"" he said.Another resident, Jumho Maheshwari, said his entire family of six was trapped inside their first-floor apartment. ""Nothing is left for me now,"" he said.Maya Sham Jee, whose brother's family is still missing, called it a tragedy.""We are helpless and just looking at the rescue workers to bring our loved ones back safely.""Authorities said the building had been declared unsafe and that eviction notices were sent out in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Javed Nabi Khoso, a senior district government official, said, ""We don't want to impose our orders by force. We work in phases and send them notices to leave the building. They didn't take the notices seriously.""The building had long been declared ""dangerous"" by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), which claimed that repeated eviction notices had been issued, according to ARY News.Locals, however, disputed the SBCA's claims, alleging that no such formal warnings were communicated.Commissioner Karachi Hassan Naqvi, who visited the site after 13 hours, laid blame on residents who continued living in unsafe structures.SBCA data reveals that Karachi currently has 578 buildings marked as unsafe, with District South holding the highest number of structurally compromised structures.Officials also confirmed that an adjacent building to the one that collapsed has suffered structural damage and is now under observation.However, Imran Khaskheli, a building owner and resident, denied receiving any notice. ""Do you think we are out of our senses to stay in an unsafe building with our families?"" he asked. He said he noticed cracks in the pillars early Friday and warned families to evacuate. ""Many did not heed my warning,"" he said, adding that about 40 families lived in the building.Shankar Kamho, 30, said his wife called him when she noticed the cracks. ""I told her to get out immediately,"" he said. His wife warned the neighbours, but one woman reportedly replied, ""This building will stand for at least 10 more years"". Still, his wife and daughter left in time, just 20 minutes before the collapse.According to officials, more than 50 buildings in the district have been declared unsafe. Six were evacuated after Friday's collapse.","Six-storey residential building collapsed in Karachi's Lyari neighbourhood, killing 16 people and injuring 13 others.

Poll Do you think owning exotic pets like lions should be banned? Yes No





A runaway pet lion attacked a woman and two children on a busy street in Lahore, Pakistan, according to police statements on Friday.Police footage shared by various media outlets showed the lion leaping over a barrier from its enclosure and chasing a woman carrying shopping bags on Thursday night. Surveillance video captured the lion pouncing on her back and knocking her to the ground, while a child attempted to flee. The lion was then seen chasing other pedestrians as bystanders scrambled to escape.According to a police statement citing the children's father, quoted by AFP, the lion attacked his kids aged five and seven years, after injuring the mother, causing injuries to their arms and faces.The victims received hospital treatment, though their injuries were not life-threatening.The father's statement in the police report indicated that the lion's owners appeared entertained by the attack on pedestrians.Three individuals were arrested in connection to the case by police on Friday. ""The suspects departed with the lion but were apprehended within 12 hours of the incident,"" the Lahore Deputy Inspector General Operations office told AFP.The 11-month-old male lion was seized by authorities and transferred to a wildlife sanctuary, where the staff confirmed the animal's healthy condition.In Pakistan's most populated province of Punjab, keeping exotic animals, particularly large felines, has traditionally indicated status and influence.In December 2024, a security guard fatally shot an adult lion that had escaped its enclosure in another Lahore district, causing panic among residents.This event led the provincial administration to implement new regulations governing the trade, purchase, breeding and ownership of large cats.Current regulations require owners to obtain proper licences for these animals, which are prohibited in residential zones. Breeders must pay substantial registration fees, and farms must occupy at least 10 acres of land.","A runaway pet lion attacked a woman and two children on a busy street in Lahore, Pakistan, according to police statements.
