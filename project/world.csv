Quoting the post, he wrote: “I would like to publicly state that I have no association or allegiance with any political party. The video being circulated is a fake, patched-up edit of an ad I did for @PrimeVideoIN. I sincerely appeal to everyone sharing it to stop spreading such distorted content and urge people not to engage with or encourage such misleading content. ”The post prompted RJD’s IT wing to delete the video, but not before it had already ignited a storm online.Hours after the actor issued a clarification, the BJP attacked the Tejashwi-led RJD for using the actor's video without his consent.""Shame on RJD ecosystem for circulating fake video of Actor Manoj Bajpayee for its campaign in Bihar!

Maithili turned 25 recently. Her father Ramesh Thakur is also her guru and teaches music. She had recently met BJP state incharge Vinod Tawde and union minister Nityanand Rai.The high-voltage campaign is building up ahead of voting for the 18th Bihar assembly, which will take place in two phases on November 6 and 11 across 243 constituencies.

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

NEW DELHI: In a surprising development, Supreme Court’s five-judge collegium led by CJI B R Gavai has spelled out the reason — Union govt’s objection — for changing the transfer destination of Madhya Pradesh HC’s Justice Atul Sreedharan from Chhattisgarh HC to Allahabad HC.Two months ago, the collegium had uploaded a statement on its August 25-26 meetings that resulted in recommending Centre transfer 14 judges from HCs where they were discharging their duties to other ones. Justice Sreedharan’s name figured at the top of the list, specifying that he was being transferred from MP HC to Chhattisgarh HC.On October 14, the collegium statement said it acceded to the government’s request for reconsideration of Justice Sreedharan’s transfer to Chhattisgarh, where he would have been senior enough to be part of the HC collegium, and “resolved to recommend” his transfer from MP HC to Allahabad HC, where he would not be in the collegium.This incident brings to fore the increasing influence of Centre, which in the past has stalled or long delayed giving effect to three-judge SC collegium decisions recommending appointments of several persons as HC judges, in the sphere of transfers. SC through its judgments had given primacy to the collegium in matters of appointment and transfers of HC and SC judges.Interestingly, recommendations of the same five-member collegium for appointment of SC judges have been notified with extreme expedition, sometimes in 48 hours, by the government in the past.However, several recommendations by the collegium, comprising CJI and four most senior judges, for transfers have been selectively put in cold storage by the government without assigning any reason. Surprisingly, the SC collegium through CJI has not made attempts to give effect to its recommendations pertaining to transfers.This has left those HC judges, whose transfers have been recommended by the collegium but not given effect, in a piquant situation — whether to take up cases that require detailed hearing or to wind up pending work.A similar incident took place eight years ago. Then 5-J collegium led by incumbent CJI Dipak Misra had recommended transfer of Karnataka HC’s Justice Jayant Patil, who during his stint at Gujarat HC had ordered a probe into the Ishrat Jahan case, to Bombay HC.The government immediately conveyed its disagreement to the proposal. The collegium hurriedly met at the residence of one of the judges and changed the transfer destination to Allahabad HC. Justice Patil tendered his resignation to the President.",Supreme Court's five-judge collegium led by CJI B R Gavai has spelled out the reason — Union govt’s objection — for changing the transfer destination of Justice Atul Sreedharan from Chhattisgarh HC to Allahabad HC.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124617391,imgsize-8538,width-400,resizemode-4/screenshot-2025-10-17-035450.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Cautioning high courts, and itself, against routinely ordering CBI probes, Supreme Court on Thursday said courts should invoke their power to direct an inquiry by the central agency as a last resort in an exceptional situation.A bench of justices J K Maheshwari and Vijay Bishnoi set aside Allahabad high court’s order directing a CBI probe into alleged irregularities in the recruitment process for UP legislative council staff, saying the order was passed by HC on the basis of some doubt and assumptions. The bench also referred the matter back to the high court for a rehearing.“It is well settled that directions for CBI inquiry should not be ordered by the high courts or this court in a routine manner. The jurisprudence, as developed by this court through judgments qua the direction of an investigation by CBI is well settled. It imposes a significant self-restraint on the exercise of this extraordinary constitutional power under Article 32 or Article 226 of the Constitution. The exercise of inherent powers to direct CBI to investigate must be exercised sparingly, cautiously and only in exceptional situations,” Justice Maheshwari, who penned the judgment for the bench, said.“This court has consistently cautioned that a CBI investigation should not be directed as a matter of routine or merely because a party casts certain aspersions or harbours a subjective lack of confidence in the state police. It goes without saying that for invoking this power, the court concerned must be satisfied that the material placed prima facie discloses commission of offences and necessitates a CBI investigation to ensure the fundamental right to a fair and impartial investigation, or where the complexity, scale or national ramification of such allegations demands expertise of central agency,” he said.The bench said while there was no inflexible guideline to decide when such power should be exercised, courts may do it when a case had national or international ramifications. Interestingly, a bench headed by Justice Maheshwari, through an interim order on Monday, had directed CBI to probe the Karur stampede case in Tamil Nadu.Cautioning against burdening a central agency with matters that do not satisfy the threshold of an exceptional case, SC added: “An order directing an investigation to be carried out by CBI should be treated as a measure of last resort, justified only when the constitutional court is convinced that the integrity of the process has been compromised or has reasons to believe that it may get compromised to a degree that shakes the conscience of courts or public faith in the justice delivery system. ”“Such compelling circumstances may typically arise when the materials brought in notice of the court prima facie point towards systemic failure, the involvement of high-ranking state officials or politically influential persons, or when the local police’s conduct itself creates a reasonable doubt in the minds of the citizenry regarding their ability to conduct a neutral probe,” the bench said.",A bench of justices J K Maheshwari and Vijay Bishnoi set aside Allahabad high court’s order directing a CBI probe into alleged irregularities in the recruitment process for UP legislative council staff.

Durgapur rape case: Victim's father apologises to 'mother-like' Mamata; seeks justice for daughter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/durgapur-rape-case-victims-father-apologises-to-mother-like-mamata-seeks-justice-for-daughter/articleshow/124579824.cms,"NEW DELHI: Days after criticising chief minister Mamata Banerjee over her remarks on women's safety, the father of the Durgapur gang rape victim on Wednesday described her as a ""mother-like figure"" and sought forgiveness, urging her to help secure justice for his daughter.""Mamata Banerjee is like a mother-like figure to me. If I have said anything wrong, I ask her to forgive me. I will render countless obeisance at her feet. But I ask her to help my daughter get justice,"" the victim’s father told TV channels, according to PTI.""I have been demanding a CBI probe into this case. I think that would be good. But that depends on the state administration as well,"" he added.His remarks come days after he criticised the chief minister for her comment that ""women should not venture out at night,"" following the assault of his daughter, a second-year MBBS student at a private medical college in Durgapur.Earlier on Monday, the survivor's father stated that, ""She (Mamata Banerjee) is also a woman. How can she say such an irresponsible thing? Should women quit their jobs and sit at home? It seems Bengal is under the rule of Aurangzeb.""He further expressed a loss of faith in West Bengal's law and order situation and said he wanted to take his daughter back to Odisha for her safety. ""I want to take my daughter back to Odisha. Her life comes first, her career later,"" he added.The controversy began after Mamata Banerjee, while addressing the media about the crime, said, ""I learned that she was outside the campus at 12.30 am. Students residing in hostels should refrain from venturing out at night. Private medical colleges must ensure the safety of their students, particularly female students, who should not be permitted to leave the premises at night. Girls should protect themselves as well. ""Defending the police, Banerjee had said it was not possible for officers to monitor everyone's movements or stand guard outside every house.Her comments, however, drew sharp criticism from opposition leaders, women’s rights groups, and the Odisha government, who accused her of victim-blaming.Mamata later clarified that her statement had been ""distorted and taken out of context."" ""The media distorted my words. You ask me a question, I answer it, and then you distort it. Do not try this kind of politics,"" she asserted.The 22-year-old MBBS student was allegedly gang-raped on October 10 after she stepped out of her college campus with a male friend to get food.Police have so far arrested six people, including the friend, in connection with the case, which has triggered widespread outrage and political uproar across the state.","Mamata Banerjee is like a mother-like figure to me.

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

New Delhi: Supreme Court has expressed reluctance to accede to requests from SC Bar Association president Vikas Singh and solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against advocate Rakesh Kishore for attempting to hurl a shoe at CJI B R Gavai, and restrain social media from glorifying the incident.Though the attorney general has granted consent to initiating contempt actions, as is statutorily required, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi Thursday appeared to be wary of the possibility of contempt proceedings providing fresh fodder to those justifying his action.The mentioning was jointly made by Vikas Singh and other SCBA office bearers along with Mehta, who informed the bench that as per the requirement under Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, AG R Venkataramani has granted consent for initiation of contempt proceedings against Kishore for his act, which grossly undermined institutional dignity and interfered with administration of justice.Singh said Kishore is being projected as a hero in a section of social media, which may encourage others to indulge in such reprehensible acts. The SG said SC must consider passing a John Doe order restraining all social media channels from glorifying the incident.Justice Kant said, “There will be multiple problems. SC as an institution has over the decades zealously protected the right to free speech. But we are also of the view that the right to free speech cannot be at the cost of the dignity and reputation of others.How to deal with these competing issues is the question. A John Doe order will trigger the next wave of derogatory comments.”Justices Kant and Bagchi said the CJI had magnanimously ignored the incident and appealed to everyone to follow suit. “The institution never gets affected by such incidents. It is our acts and behaviour which determine our dignity and respect. It is in that spirit that the CJI had brushed aside the incident as an irresponsible act of a citizen.”An unrepentant Kishore had claimed he had hurled the shoe to protest CJI's alleged remarks on the decapitated Vishnu idol at Khajuraho.The bench, on repeated pleas to initiate contempt proceedings, said, “Our request to you is to consider whether taking up the contempt plea would give fresh winds to intensify the contemptuous chirping in social media. Moreover, when we are already burdened with a heavy caseload, should we waste judicial time on such issues?”Mehta said the algorithm of social media is such that an incident like the present one gets amplified to monetise the content for the maker. Justice Bagchi said, “The algorithm is so programmed that the contents which appeal to the baser instincts of people go viral. Mere mentioning for initiation of contempt proceedings would go viral and monetise the makers. Let it die its natural death.”Justice Kant said, “The incident is to be treated with the contempt it deserves.”",Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi expressed reluctance to accede to requests from SC Bar Association president Vikas Singh and solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta.

What allegedly prompted Mahendra Reddy to murder his wife?





BENGALURU: A city-based surgeon has been charged with murdering his newlywed wife, a dermatologist, by allegedly administering repeated overdoses of anaesthesia under the pretext of treatment.Though the alleged murder took place in April this year, police arrested the accused doctor on Tuesday, after forensic science laboratory (FSL) reports confirmed the presence of anaesthesia in the viscera samples of the deceased woman.Marathahalli police from the Whitefield division announced Wednesday the arrest of Dr Mahendra Reddy GS, 31, a surgical resident at the Institute of Gastroenterology Sciences and Organ Transplant (IGOT), on the premises of Victoria Hospital.Read also: 'Anaesthesia of death’: How Bengaluru doctor’s 'cure' became a crime; killed dermatologist wife in cold blood He is accused of murdering his wife, Kritika M Reddy, 28, whom he had married in March 2024.Announcing the arrest, city police commissioner Seemant Kumar Singh stated that FSL reports confirmed the presence of Propofol, an intravenous anaesthetic used to induce and maintain unconsciousness for surgery, procedural sedation, or intensive care sedation.“Soon after Kritika Reddy’s death, we had registered a case of unnatural death.Now, her father, based on the FSL report, has filed a fresh complaint accusing his son-in-law of administering an overdose of anaesthesia and killing the victim,” Singh said.Police investigations revealed that Mahendra Reddy had shifted Kritika to Cauvery Hospital in Marathahalli on April 24, claiming she had fallen unconscious at their Munnekolal residence in Whitefield.However, doctors declared her brought dead. Since the doctors issued a death memo, an autopsy became imperative. Mahendra Reddy reportedly argued extensively with the Cauvery Hospital doctors and police, asking them to refrain from carrying out the autopsy.He also persuaded his father-in-law, K Muni Reddy, to request the police not to perform it. “I cannot think of doctors cutting my daughter’s body into pieces and examining it. Please don't do it,” Muni Reddy repeatedly told the authorities.Additional Commissioner of Police, East Division, Ramesh Banoth, said that despite the requests and objections from the father and husband, the body was subjected to an autopsy.“It was mandatory since a death memo had been issued. Meanwhile, the Scene of Crime Officer’s (SOCO) team visited the residence and collected all evidence, including medical materials such as injections and liquids used in treating the victim.According to the doctor husband, his wife had long-standing gastrointestinal (GI) issues, which he was treating,” Banoth said.After the post-mortem, Kritika’s body was handed over to her family. The ‘Reason for death’ column in the autopsy report was left blank, pending the FSL report.However, the FSL report, received by police on Tuesday, changed the course of the case from an unnatural death to a cold-blooded murder.Investigators traced Mahendra Reddy to Manipal in Udupi district and detained him. According to police sources, Reddy was attending a conference at the time.“Accused has taken a defensive stand, stating that he had treated his wife for gastrointestinal issues and that administering anaesthesia was part of it. However, he has no explanation for the overdose,” an investigating officer said.Police sources said Kritika’s long-term ill health disturbed Mahendra.“Soon after the marriage, Mahendra Reddy discovered that Kritika had multiple health issues, including low blood pressure and gastrointestinal problems. He was angry with Kritika’s parents for allegedly hiding this information before the marriage. This could be one of the reasons,” an officer said.Meanwhile, Muni Reddy’s complaint to Marathahalli police states that Mahendra Reddy often demanded money from Kritika.“He wanted me to build a private hospital for Kritika, and I refused, stating I did not have that much money. Meanwhile, Mahendra was ignoring my daughter while growing close to another woman. He treated her gastrointestinal issues by administering liquids intravenously. After her death, Mahendra and his family objected to the autopsy. However, my elder daughter Nikita, also a doctor, insisted on it. Based on her insistence, an unnatural death report was registered. Now, the FSL report confirms the presence of anaesthesia in her viscera samples. I seek legal action against Mahendra for murdering my daughter,” Muni Reddy’s complaint read.","Dr Mahendra Reddy GS, 31, a surgical resident at the Institute of Gastroenterology Sciences and Organ Transplant (IGOT), was arrested on Tuesday.

'His tyre has already been flattened': RJD



Kishor bows out — 'in larger interest'



NEW DELHI: In Bihar’s charged political arena, the adage “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” seemed to come alive on Wednesday, as rivals —BJP-JD(U) and RJD —found common ground in Prashant Kishor . The trio united in criticism of Jan Suraaj Party founder while mocking him for deciding to eventually not contest the upcoming assembly elections.Union minister Giriraj Singh was even more scathing, calling Kishor’s expectations of winning over 150 seats “Mungerilal ke haseen sapne” — a reference to a popular television show about daydreams. “Kishor realised he would not win. His party is nothing but a ‘vote katwa’ outfit — the ‘B team’ of the RJD,” Singh said.Echoing that sentiment, BJP spokesperson Niraj Kumar said, “Kishor’s bubble burst even before the elections. By announcing that he won’t contest, he has admitted defeat for himself and his party.” JD(U)’s Neeraj Kumar called the move “a humiliation for his workers,” accusing Kishor of having “run away before the electoral battle.”BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said Kishor’s withdrawal was “a business decision,” adding, “Prashant Kishor is a very smart businessman and has a lot of experience in election campaigns. Perhaps he realised that the ground situation is not in his favour and that if he loses, his enterprise will lose credibility.”JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar called Kishor’s withdrawal a “humiliation” for his own party workers, accusing him of abandoning ship before the real fight began. “He has run away before the electoral battle,” Kumar said.“Earlier, he claimed to have undertaken padayatras to understand the people's issues. What happened to that? His decision is sheer embarrassment for his workers,” he added.RJD’s Mrityunjay Tiwary also mocked Kishor saying he had “accepted defeat before the battle began.” “Kishor has realised that he and his party will face a humiliating defeat in the upcoming assembly polls,” Tiwary remarked.“Kishor must understand that politics is not as easy as offering consultancy to others. His tyre has already been flattened.”Prashant Kishor, once among India’s most sought-after election strategists, announced that he would stay away from contesting this year’s Bihar polls — a decision he said was taken “in the larger interest” of his Jan Suraaj Party. In an interview with PTI, Kishor said a tally of “less than 150 seats” would be considered a defeat for his party, but insisted that “if Jan Suraaj wins, it will change national politics.”He explained that his decision was meant to keep the focus on party-building rather than personal ambition. “If I were to contest, it would have distracted me from the necessary organisational work,” said Kishor, who was earlier expected to contest from Raghopur, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav’s constituency.","Prashant Kishor, once among India’s most sought-after election strategists, announced that he would stay away from contesting this year's Bihar polls.

An uneasy ceasefire may have paused six days of fierce fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan, but the name haunting Islamabad remains the same: Noor Wali Mehsud, the militant cleric Pakistan blames for bringing the country to the brink.As Reuters reported, Pakistani forces believed they had their moment last week when an airstrike in Kabul targeted an armoured Toyota Land Cruiser thought to be carrying Mehsud, leader of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). But the strike failed. Militants and Pakistani officials said he survived, and soon after, the group released an audio message purportedly from him, proof, perhaps, that the TTP chief had once again slipped through Pakistan’s grasp.The strike, Pakistan's first in Kabul since the 2022 US drone killing of Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, was followed by deadly clashes along the Afghan border. For nearly a week, both sides exchanged artillery and drone fire, killing dozens and injuring hundreds. As Associated Press reported, Taliban officials accused Islamabad of carrying out two drone strikes in Kabul just hours before the truce took effect, while the UN urged both sides to end hostilities.Behind Pakistan’s anger lies a deeper grievance: Mehsud’s continued sanctuary in Afghanistan. Islamabad has repeatedly accused Kabul’s Taliban rulers of harbouring him and his lieutenants, an allegation the Afghan Taliban deny.According to Reuters, Mehsud, a 47-year-old cleric trained in Pakistan’s seminaries, revived the TTP after years of disarray. When he took over in 2018, the group was fractured and on the run, its leaders killed in US drone strikes. But Mehsud, described by analysts as both “a strategist and an ideologue,” united splinter factions, reorganised command, and shifted tactics.Unlike his predecessors, Mehsud curtailed attacks on civilians, a deliberate move to regain sympathy in Pakistan’s tribal belt after the horror of the 2014 Peshawar school massacre, which killed over 130 children. He ordered fighters to focus instead on the army and police, portraying Pakistan’s military as “anti-Islam” and accusing its generals of “hijacking the people of Pakistan for 78 years.”Under his leadership, the TTP renewed its insurgency. The UN’s Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee lists him for “financing, planning, and perpetrating” terrorist acts, noting the group’s claims of deadly strikes on Pakistani security forces in North Waziristan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2019. As of late 2022, UN records placed Mehsud in Afghanistan’s Paktika province, near the border.Born in 1978 in South Waziristan’s Machikhel village, Mehsud studied at multiple Islamic seminaries across Pakistan before joining jihadist ranks. As detailed by the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS), he fought alongside the Afghan Taliban in the 1990s, later joining the TTP in 2003. He rose quickly first as a judge in TTP’s shadow courts, then as its Karachi chief, and finally as deputy to Maulana Fazlullah before taking command in 2018.What distinguishes Mehsud from other militants is his intellectual bent. He is the author of several books, including Inqilab-e-Mehsud (The Mehsud Revolution), a 700-page account linking his movement to anti-colonial resistance. In it, he even claimed responsibility for orchestrating the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, saying she planned to ally with the U.S. against the mujahideen.Analysts describe him as both “a battlefield commander and a theorist.” He views Pakistan’s military operations against militants as a “defensive jihad” retaliation against what he portrays as the army’s betrayal of tribal traditions by handing over foreign fighters to the U.S. His stated goals: preserving Mehsud tribal autonomy, defeating America in Afghanistan, and establishing a Taliban-style Islamic system.Since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021, Mehsud’s TTP has enjoyed renewed momentum. Pakistan claims the group has used Afghan soil to launch near-daily attacks, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Efforts at negotiation have failed. According to Reuters, the TTP’s demands implementing Islamic law in border regions and the army’s withdrawal were flatly rejected by Islamabad.The failed airstrike in Kabul has made Mehsud an even more defiant figure. His survival has not only embarrassed Pakistan’s military but also underscored the fragility of its ties with Kabul. For now, an uneasy truce holds, but the man once dismissed as a fugitive cleric has managed to force Pakistan into one of its deadliest border crises in decades, a testament to the enduring power of Noor Wali Mehsud, the scholar-commander who turned ideology into insurgency.","Noor Wali Mehsud is the leader of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) Pakistani forces believed they had their moment last week when an airstrike in Kabul targeted an armoured Toyota Land Cruiser.

Charlie Kirk’s assassination shocks America and sparks national outrage

The NBA has suspended one of its employees for mocking conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s assassination on social media.

As a result, the person was suspended without pay for two weeks.The league said it takes such actions seriously, especially when employees’ online comments damage the NBA’s image.

Police identified the suspect as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who was arrested and charged with aggravated murder. Investigators found messages and notes showing the attack was planned.Charlie Kirk’s killing drew nationwide attention.

US President Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, a day before he meets Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington.""I am speaking to President Putin now. The conversation is ongoing, a lengthy one, and I will report the contents, as will President Putin, at its conclusion,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.The call comes ahead of Trump’s meeting on Friday at the White House with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has been pressing Trump to sell Kyiv Tomahawk missiles that would allow Ukrainian forces to strike deeper into Russian territory. Zelenskyy has argued such strikes would help compel Putin to take Trump’s calls for direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine to end the war more seriously.Trump had told reporters traveling with him to Israel on Sunday that he had planned to discuss the Tomahawks with Putin as a way to pressure him to end Russia's war in Ukraine. “Do they want to have Tomahawks going in that direction? I don’t think so,” Trump said on Sunday. “I think I might speak to Russia about that.”Trump has recently taken a tougher stance toward Moscow, showing growing frustration with Putin, while expressing support for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia following the 2022 invasion.Ending the wars in Ukraine and Gaza was a key part of Donald Trump’s 2024 reelection campaign, during which he repeatedly criticised former US President Joe Biden for his handling of both conflicts.However, like Biden, Trump has faced difficulties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as his efforts to persuade Putin to hold direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have so far failed. The war is now close to entering its fourth year.After helping broker the Gaza ceasefire, Trump has expressed renewed confidence that he can make progress toward ending the Ukraine war. He has also indicated that he is prepared to increase pressure on Putin if he does not agree to negotiations soon.“Interestingly we made progress today, because of what's happened in the Middle East,” Trump said on Wednesday evening while addressing supporters at a dinner for his White House ballroom project.Earlier this week, during a speech to the Israeli parliament in Jerusalem, Trump said the Gaza truce could help the United States assist Israel and other Middle Eastern nations in normalising relations. He also stated that his top foreign policy goal is to end the ongoing war in Europe.""First we have to get Russia done,"" Trump said, addressing his special envoy Steve Witkoff, who has been serving as his administration’s main contact with Putin. ""We gotta get that one done. If you don’t mind, Steve, let’s focus on Russia first. All right?""","US President Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday.

61 Senior Naxal Cadres Surrender In Gadchiroli In Presence Of Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis





RAIPUR/NAGPUR: Chhattisgarh’s Bastar awaits the largest mass surrender of Maoists in its history of Left-wing extremism Friday, with 170 guerrillas lined up to formally lay down arms in what home minister Amit Shah termed a “landmark day” in the battle to purge the country’s Red Corridor of Naxalite influence.“Abujhmarh and North Bastar that were once terror bases have today been declared free from Naxal terror... A trace of Naxalism exists in south Bastar, which will be wiped out soon by security forces,” Shah declared on X.The surrender ceremony, to be held in Jagdalpur in the presence of CM Vishnu Deo Sai and his deputy Vijay Sharma, comes three days after CPI (Maoist) politburo veteran Mallojula Venugopal Rao, aka Bhupathi, turned himself in along with 61 other guerrillas in Maharashtra’s Maoist heartland of Gadchiroli.The Maoists converging on Jagdalpur include 78 who reported to police in Kanker, Sukma and Kondagaon districts late Wednesday. Pictures and videos of armed guerrillas, including women, crossing forested areas and fields to the designated camps are circulating on social media.Maoist commander Rupesh and Marh division in-charge Ranita are part of the surrender list, officials said. Rupesh, who oversaw CPI (Maoist)’s northwest sub-zonal bureau, sent out feelers last April about his willingness to surrender and has since been in contact with security agencies.Sources said he was recently elevated to the outfit’s central committee, but the added responsibilities failed to hold him back. He had been a Maoist for two decades, playing a key role in recruitment, coordination and propaganda.“Naxalism is breathing its last due to the relentless efforts of Modi government,” Shah said. “Our policy is clear: those who want to surrender are welcome, and those who continue to wield the gun will meet the wrath of forces. I appeal again...lay down weapons and join the mainstream. We’re committed to uprooting Naxalism before March 31, 2026.”",Chhattisgarh’s Bastar awaits the largest mass surrender of Maoists in its history of Left-wing extremism. 170 guerrillas lined up to formally lay down arms in what home minister Amit Shah termed a ‘landmark day’ in the battle to purge the country�s Red Corridor of Naxalite influence.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124615628,imgsize-306994,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/screenshot-2025-10-17-031129.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A 13-year-old boy on a cycle was allegedly run over twice by a Mahindra Thar in southwest Delhi's Vasant Kunj on Wednesday. Eyewitnesses claimed that the SUV driver, yet to be identified, first hit and crushed the child and then reversed over him before fleeing. The boy was declared dead on arrival at hospital.The boy has been identified as Murshid, a student of Class VIII who lived in a jhuggi near the spot in Sector C. Police said he was hit from behind by the vehicle near a petrol pump. The impact also left the bicycle mangled. A case has been registered under sections 281 (rash or negligent driving) and 106(1) (causing death by negligence) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita at the Vasant Kunj North police station.According to Murshid's family, he had gone out to buy snacks around 4.30pm when the incident took place close to Mehrauli-Mahipalpur Road, a few steps from his home. The petrol pump opposite the spot is surrounded by several bylanes cramped with jhuggis.Ganesh Mathur (45), who works at the petrol pump, said he heard a loud noise and saw a car speeding away. Murada, a 50-year-old vendor who sells boiled eggs nearby, said, ""I heard kids screaming gala kat gaya, gala kat gaya (throat has been cut) and thought a snatching had taken place.I ran to see the boy lying in a pool of blood, face down.""Mahesh Chand (50), who works as a guard in an adjacent residential colony, said, ""I heard that a boy had been run over. We found out that the car had run over Murshid twice."" A friend of Murshid added that some boys ran behind the car to get its number.Murshid's 35-year-old mother, Johana, said she was at her jhuggi when two children came running and told her about the accident. ""His face and neck were soaked in blood,"" a distraught Johana recalled. The family took the boy to hospital in an auto with the help of neighbours.Clutching her son's blue T-shirt, Johana said, ""We may live in a jhuggi, but his dreams were much bigger. He wanted to be an Army officer."" Murshid's father had abandoned the family around a year ago and his mother had to stop working as a domestic help due to poor health. She suffers from frequent bouts of fever and extreme weakness due to blood sugar fluctuations, said Johana, who belongs to Araria district in Bihar.The family owns a few jhuggis and earned Rs 5,000 every month by renting them out while Murshid often did odd jobs like helping out at local sweet shops and delivering groceries. ""He would tend to me and massage my legs whenever my health got bad,"" Johana said.Remembering their last conversation, Tarana, the victim's 18-year-old elder sister, said, ""He just returned after writing his Hindi paper. He wanted to eat samosas with me and stepped out to get some."" He borrowed the bicycle from a friend, ""but never returned"", rued the mother.Murshid's friends remembered him as a quiet boy who never engaged in arguments. ""He was smart and kind,"" said Ajmeri, a 39-year-old neighbour.Tarana, who studies in Class X and dreams of becoming an IPS officer, alleged, ""People were passing by and looking, even making videos, but no one came forward to help us.""Johana, who moved into the house in 2001, said, ""I got a lot in this house, but I also lost a lot here.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently backed President Donald Trump ’s plan to deploy troops in San Francisco. Joining him is now Tesla CEO Elon Musk who recently said that “This is the only solution at this point”. The tech billionaire was responding to a local advocate T Wolf's post citing a March 2025 survey where 61% of voters strongly support federal intervention to deport illegal fentanyl traffickers, rising to 83% including those who somewhat agree.The quoted post references SFPD's seizure of over 90 kilos of fentanyl in the past year and approximately 4,300 overdose deaths since 2020, aligning with official data showing 3,367 confirmed unintentional drug overdose fatalities from 2020 to 2024, with 2025 figures ongoing.“Pretty much 80% of San Francisco wants federal intervention on deporting drug dealers. That's how insane it's been here. 90+ kilos of fentanyl seized in one year by SFPD. 4,300 OD deaths since 2020. Hard data doesn't lie,” T Wolf wrote in the post. In another post, Wolf said “It's simple. If you want to keep federal troops out of San Francisco, remove the organized drug dealers and 80% of the problem goes away. If you don't, you reap what you sow.Replying to the post, Elon Musk wrote “It’s the only solution at this point. Nothing else has or will work.”In an interview last week, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said he supports former President Donald Trump’s proposal to send federal troops to San Francisco, a plan that city leaders have called unacceptable.Benioff said he “avidly supported President Trump” and backed the idea of deploying troops to help reduce crime. “We don't have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I'm all for it,” The New York Times quoted him as saying.Trump had reportedly discussed sending federal troops to San Francisco during an Oval Office meeting in August, naming it among several Democratic-led cities he said had been “destroyed.” He added that he would “clean that one up, too.”Benioff also praised Elon Musk’s DOGE initiative to cut federal spending and voiced support for venture capitalist David Sacks, who chairs Trump’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.San Francisco Democrats strongly criticized Benioff’s remarks.",Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently backed President Donald Trump’s plan to deploy troops in San Francisco.

German parliament opens debate on military service bill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/german-parliament-opens-debate-on-military-service-bill/articleshow/124619589.cms,"German chancellor Friedrich Merz addresses the German parliament during a debate at the Reichstag (Image credits: AP)

Pistorius : Anything less than passionate debate would be disappointing



CDU politicians stick by lot-drawing proposal, but signal flexibility



Aiming to double the Bundeswehr's ranks, with few clear ideas on how



What does the current proposal entail, and what is currently in German law?







Germany's Bundestag parliament began its first reading of the contentious bill seeking to reintroduce some form of military service, on a purely voluntary basis at first but with contested plans to add some kind of mandatory component in future if necessary.The legislation to modernise the Bundeswehr military is supposed to come into force in 2026, but time is already running short, and frictions on the policy plans spilled out into the public earlier in the week.Politicians from both ruling parties, the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats, tried to indicate flexibility and willingness for compromise after the communications blunders of the previous 48 hours.Meanwhile, some Greenpeace members and others from the conscientious objector group, the German peace society, stood outside the parliament with banners decrying the plans.Social Democrat defense minister Boris Pistorius opened the parliamentary debate by praising parliament, saying he was ""proud and grateful that we in this house have found democratic paths to considerably and rapidly improve the defensive capabilities of our country"" in recent years in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.""Today we are taking the next logical step together: the step to expand our combat forces,"" Pistorius said.He said the coalition government had agreed ""to first try to do this using the voluntary route.""This follows the confusion on Tuesday as coalition circles leaked news of a breakthrough on a means of mandatory recruitment via lottery if necessary, only to then abruptly cancel a press conference that was supposed to brief defense reporters on the plan that evening.Pistorius also made oblique mention of this, but more by seeking to stress that any decision on obligatory recruitment was not part of the current bill and was a matter for a future debate.""What's also clear is that if voluntary recruitment does not suffice, there will be no alternative besides some form of obligatory recruitement,"" Pistorius said. ""But even then, that would clearly only take place under the authority of a Bundestag resolution, and using methods that are yet to be decided.""The defense minister tried to argue that the friction of recent days should come as no surprise, even as a reassurance, not least given Germany's difficult 20th century military history.""Anything less than a passionate, open and also heated debate on a question like this would have been a disappointment to me, be it in parliament, in classrooms, or in society in general,"" Pistorius said. ""This issue deserves an open and honest debate because it affects the lives of many people.""Politicains from chancellor Friedrich Merz's CDU said they stood by their lottery-based ""Plan B"" for the case that voluntary recruitment falls short of targets or needs.This idea was hammered out in talks with SPD negotiators Siemtje Möller and Norbert Röttgen but did not meet approval from Pistorius or SPD parliamentarians and so was shelved again. According to German media reports, the issue became the source of considerable tension between Möller, Röttgen and Pistorius.CDU defense policy expert Thomas Erndl described the lottery proposal as a fair idea.""Anyone with better suggestions can gladly put them on the table,"" Erndl said, but argued it was irresponsible not to consider what would happen if too few young men signed up.""We have a damn duty to think about a Plan B as well,"" he said.The stated long-term aim is to more than double the number of active German servicemen and women to 460,000 by 2035; comprised of roughly 260,000 permanent soldiers and around 200,000 reservists.Currently, the Bundeswehr has around 182,000 servicemen and women and has been struggling to recruit more.Neither the draft law as it stands nor the lottery proposal is very clear on the contentious question of mandatory recruitment.The draft law mentions the likelihood for the need of ""comprehensive mustering"" as of 2027, but doesn't say how it plans to achieve this, and avoids clarifying whether it means mustering in the sense of compulsory conscription, or simply an obligation for young men to muster for inspection and consideration.The lottery proposal, meanwhile, was said to involve drawing lots to make up any shortfall, but then to try to encourage those whose lot was drawn to volunteer, rather than obliging them to act. Again, it didn't explain how it planned to achieve this, though Tuesday's canceled presentation might conceivably have shed more light.As of 2026, the bill foresees sending a questionnaire to all men aged 18 asking about their availability and interest in military service; responding will be mandatory.Young women will also be sent the questionnaire, but will have no obligation to respond.The government hopes that enough men will signal a desire to join voluntarily, at least in the short term.Germany had conscription to a form of mandatory national service, but not necessarily in the military, for men leaving school until as recently as 2011.The legal right to oblige young men to serve for a period is enshrined in the constitution, and was only suspended by a simple majority vote in parliament when the system was scrapped. Another simple majority vote would suffice in theory to reactivate the provision as it is.But adding women to the provision, or altering its content, would require a two-thirds majority in the lower and upper houses of parliament instead. The coalition government by itself is nowhere near commanding these majorities, even if it could reach internal agreement on the issue.",Germany's Bundestag parliament began its first reading of the contentious bill seeking to reintroduce some form of military service. The legislation to modernise the Bundeswehr military is supposed to come into force in 2026. Politicians from both ruling parties tried to indicate flexibility and willingness for compromise after the communications blunders of the previous 48 hours.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124619771,imgsize-1365354,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
‘Unhinged’ wolf warrior: US Treasury Secy Bessent slams China’s trade negotiator; claims he showed up uninvited,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/unhinged-wolf-warrior-us-treasury-secy-bessent-slams-chinas-trade-negotiator-claims-he-showed-up-uninvited/articleshow/124619411.cms,"'Showed up uninvited': Bessent on China trade negotiator

China hits back at Bessent’s remarks

Bessent’s claims at odds with China





In a sign of growing US-China trade tensions, America’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday called Beijing’s trade official ‘unhinged’, likening him to a wolf warrior - a term normally used for aggressive Chinese diplomats.The stabilising US-China diplomatic relations deteriorated recently following American expansion of technology restrictions and proposed tariffs on Chinese vessels at US ports. Beijing retaliated with corresponding measures, including stricter controls on exports of rare earths and other strategic materials.According to a Bloomberg report, Bessent criticised a senior Chinese trade representative, accusing him of arriving in Washington without invitation and displaying aggressive behaviour characteristic of China's confrontational diplomatic approach.Bessent claimed that Li Chenggang's visit to Washington on August 28 was not authorised by the Donald Trump administration. During a Wednesday press conference, the Treasury chief suggested the vice minister's arrival with provocative rhetoric might indicate independent action.“Perhaps the vice minister who showed up here with very incendiary language on August 28 has gone rogue,” he said.Bessent's criticism targeted one of China's most distinguished trade specialists.Li, who serves as vice minister, holds advanced legal credentials, specifically a Master of Laws qualification from the University of Hamburg in Germany.Bessent expressed strong disapproval of Li's conduct, describing it as disrespectful. During an event, Bessent incorrectly pronounced Li's name as ""Kuanggong"" and called him ‘low level’, despite Li holding full ministerial status in China.Li, aged 58, was designated as China's vice minister of commerce and trade envoy in April, following Trump's announcement of huge Liberation Day tariffs. Working alongside He Lifeng, China's chief trade negotiator, Li has been central to multiple negotiation sessions between the two leading global economies.During his tenure as China's representative to the World Trade Organization in Geneva from February 2021 until his April appointment, Li demonstrated his negotiation skills. Keith Rockwell, a former WTO spokesperson who interacted with Li, describes him as resolute yet measured in his approach.Li established himself as an astute diplomat with comprehensive knowledge during his role leading China's discussions with the Obama administration regarding a bilateral investment agreement.""He knew his stuff"" and ""didn't allow the US to push him around,"" Rockwell shared with Bloomberg News earlier this year.""Chinese officials seldom go rogue, and those that do, tend to end up out of a job especially under Xi Jinping 's heavily centralized rule,"" Thomas said. ""So it's highly unlikely that Li's actions were anything other than approved by Xi in Beijing.""China's Commerce Ministry released a statement on Thursday indicating that Bessent had severely misrepresented the facts. According to spokesperson He Yongqian, Li visited the United States to pursue discussions that followed the earlier discussions between Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump.Recent diplomatic exchanges between China and the US have continued, with China putting forward proposals. However, he noted that the US's unreceptive response on shipping issues has compelled China to implement retaliatory measures.China’s Commerce Ministry confirmed that in late August, Li travelled to Washington for meetings with treasury, commerce and trade officials. The ministry's statement noted that during this visit, he stressed the ""principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation.""Lin Jian, the spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, emphasised that their nation's stance on trade matters remained ""consistent and clear.""""The US should work with China to resolve relevant issues through dialogue and consultation based on equality, mutual respect and reciprocity, rather than repeatedly resorting to pressure and threats,"" he said.According to the Bloomberg report, Bessent offered a contrasting account, indicating that Li had cautioned about potential ""global chaos"" if the United States proceeded with implementing port fees on Chinese vessels. ""Maybe he thinks he's a wolf warrior,"" he stated.Neil Thomas, Fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis, is of the view that Bessent aims to convey to Xi that easing recent export restrictions could facilitate an agreement with President Trump.","Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent criticised a senior Chinese trade representative, accusing him of arriving in Washington without invitation and displaying aggressive behaviour.

'Big Picture Failure': Former NSA John Bolton Blasts Trump for Targeting India, Not China or Russia

Similarities in the cases

Differences in the charges





Former national security adviser John Bolton has been indicted over the handling of classified information, drawing comparisons to US President Donald Trump , who faced similar allegations in the past.Bolton, who served in the Trump administration for over a year before being fired in 2019, is accused of illegally sending classified information to two family members who did not have security clearances and of keeping copies of those messages at his Maryland home.The indictment follows an FBI search of Bolton’s Maryland residence and Washington office in August.Trump, meanwhile, was previously accused of unlawfully retaining classified documents after leaving the White House in January 2021 and obstructing government efforts to retrieve them from his Florida club and residence, Mar-a-Lago. That case was dismissed after Trump won the 2024 election.Both men were accused of handling classified data insecurely. Trump allegedly stored boxes of sensitive information in unsecured locations at Mar-a-Lago, including a bathroom and a ballroom stage, according to New York Times.Bolton is accused of transmitting classified material through personal email accounts and an encrypted messaging app that were not approved for sensitive information.One of Bolton’s email accounts was reportedly hacked by Iran in 2021.Both faced multiple counts of unauthorized retention of national defense information, with Trump charged with 38 counts and Bolton with eight.In both cases, prosecutors cited public statements made by Trump and Bolton criticizing others for mishandling classified information.Trump had previously criticized Hillary Clinton ’s handling of classified information in 2016, while Bolton had criticized Trump officials in 2025 for discussing sensitive military plans on an unsecured messaging app. These statements were cited to show that both understood the rules regarding classified information.The cases also diverged in key ways. Trump faced additional obstruction charges, including allegations that he conspired to conceal documents and misled investigators.Bolton, in contrast, was charged with unauthorized transmission offenses for sharing information with relatives, but was not charged with obstruction.Another notable difference is the timing. Both men previously avoided certain legal consequences due to elections. Trump’s case was dismissed after his 2024 election victory, while an earlier investigation into Bolton’s handling of classified information in 2020 was dropped after the former President Joe Biden 's administration took office in 2021.The news emerged as Trump spoke to reporters in the Oval Office. The president said he was unaware of the indictment and criticised Bolton, calling him a “bad person” and “a bad guy”.“I think he’s a bad person,” Trump said. “He’s a bad guy.” He added, “That’s the way it goes, right?” he said.

Caribbean strikes the trigger?

Who is Admiral Alvin Holsey









Admiral Alvin Holsey, who leads the US Southern Command overseeing operations across Central and South America, announced on Thursday that he is retiring from service.In his role, Holsey has overseen ongoing operations targeting suspected drug-carrying vessels in the Caribbean.""It's been an honour to serve our nation, the American people and support and defend the Constitution for over 37 years. Effective 12 December 2025 I will retire from the US Navy,"" he said in a statement on the Southern Command's X account without an explanation for his early departure.Holsey had been leading the Doral, Florida-headquartered Southern Command since November 2024.""The SOUTHCOM team had made lasting contributions to the defense of our nation and will continue to do so. I am confident that you will forge ahead, focusing on your mission that strengthens our nation and ensures it longevity as a becaon of freedom around the globe,"" he added.Secretary of defense Pete Hegseth thanked the retiring naval aviator on social media: “On behalf of the Department of War, we extend our deepest gratitude to Admiral Alvin Holsey for his more than 37 years of distinguished service to our nation as he plans to retire at year's end.The Department thanks Admiral Holsey for his decades of service to our country, and we wish him and his family continued success and fulfillment in the years ahead. ”So far, US forces have carried out at least five strikes— and a possible sixth —against alleged drug-smuggling vessels in the Caribbean, leaving 27 people dead in the first five attacks, a campaign that some experts have described as “illegal.”According to CNN, tensions had been ""simmering"" between Hegseth and Holsey for weeks before the admiral announced he was leaving.""Hegseth did not believe Holsey was moving quickly or aggressively enough to combat drug traffickers in the Caribbean. SOUTHCOM was also concerned about the operations not being lawful,"" sources said.The tensions ""came to a head"" during a meeting between Hegseth, Holsey and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine on October 6 at the Pentagon. Holsey offered his resignation, but his departure was not announced until over a week later.A native of Fort Valley, Georgia, Admiral Alvin Holsey joined the Navy in 1988 through the NROTC (Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps) programme at Morehouse College. Over his 37-year career, he commanded helicopter squadrons, led Carrier Strike Group One, served as Military Deputy Commander, and ultimately became Commander of the US Southern Command.","Admiral Alvin Holsey, who leads the US Southern Command, announced on Thursday that he is retiring from service.

Putin’s Winter War: 300 Missiles Trigger Blackouts In Ukraine As Trump ‘Rebuffs’ Tomahawks Demand

Eight regions hit by blackouts

.

Zelenskyy’s Washington mission





Ukraine suffered widespread blackouts after Russia launched one of its heaviest attacks on the country’s power grid, firing hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles overnight, officials said Thursday.The strikes crippled energy facilities across several regions, leaving millions without electricity as winter approaches.Days ago, a Russian strike on an energy facility in the town of Slavutych in Kyiv Oblast caused a several-hour blackout at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant on October 1, according to the Energy Ministry.This comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy prepared to meet US President Donald Trump in Washington on Friday, where he is expected to request more American-made air defense systems and long-range missiles to counter Russian attacks.Trump, who spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, said they plan to meet in Budapest, Hungary, to “try to bring the war to an end,” though no date has been set.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he would discuss his conversation with Putin “and much more” during his meeting with Zelenskyy, adding that “great progress was made” during the call.Ukraine’s national energy operator, Ukrenergo, said eight regions experienced power outages after the barrage.DTEK, the country’s largest private energy firm, reported major disruptions in Kyiv and said it had to halt natural gas extraction in the Poltava region due to damage. State-owned Naftogaz said gas infrastructure was hit for the sixth time this month.Zelenskyy said Russia launched over 300 drones and 37 missiles, accusing Moscow of using cluster munitions and repeatedly targeting the same sites to hinder emergency repairs. ""This fall, the Russians are using every single day to strike our energy infrastructure,"" he said on Telegram.The power grid has remained one of Russia’s key targets throughout the war. Ukrainian officials say Moscow is ""weaponizing winter"" by attacking energy facilities ahead of the cold season, a claim Russia denies, saying it only strikes military targets.Ukraine has responded by targeting Russian oil refineries crucial to its war effort. The Ukrainian military said it struck the Saratov oil refinery in southern Russia on Thursday, the second such attack in two months, as reported by news agency AP.Zelenskyy in a post on X wrote: ""Nothing has changed for Russia – it is still terrorizing life in Ukraine. A swarm of drones struck Kryvyi Rih, hitting civilian infrastructure. There were dozens more attack drones in our skies. Missiles were also spotted. In fact, not a single night in recent weeks has passed without Russian strikes on Ukraine. Most of the targets are infrastructure – a systematic campaign of terror against our energy sector. ""Zelenskyy is expected to seek cruise missiles, air defense systems and joint drone production agreements from the United States. Kyiv is also pushing for tougher sanctions on Moscow.The visit comes amid signs that Trump may increase pressure on Putin to make progress in peace negotiations. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned Wednesday that if Russia refuses to engage in talks, Washington ""will take the steps necessary to impose costs on Russia for its continued aggression.""Trump on Wednesday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured him that India would stop purchasing Russian oil, a move that could further squeeze Moscow’s war finances.Although Washington has hesitated to send long-range missiles such as Tomahawks over fears of escalation, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said such a move would “mirror Russia’s own use of long-range cruise missiles” and not widen the conflict.Meanwhile, Ukraine’s Economy Ministry announced a new partnership with US aerospace company Bell Textron Inc. to boost domestic aviation technology. The Texas-based firm plans to open an office and testing center in Ukraine while training local engineers in the United States.During its visit to the US, a Ukrainian delegation also held talks with major American defense manufacturers, including Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, as Kyiv looks to strengthen its own arms industry amid uncertain future aid from Western allies.","Ukraine suffered widespread blackouts after Russia launched one of its heaviest attacks on the country’s power grid, firing hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles overnight.

He added that high-level advisors from both sides will hold preparatory talks next week, suggesting the summit could take place soon. The US leader noted that his delegation will be led by secretary of state Marco Rubio.During Friday’s meeting, Zelenskyy is expected to push for the supply of Tomahawk missiles and other long-range US weapons capable of striking targets inside Russia.The war in Ukraine began in February 2022.

How much will it cost government?





Who to be blamed?









The Senate voted down the House-passed spending patch for the tenth time on Thursday, as the government shutdown continued with no end in sight. Because the chamber does not plan to be in legislative session again until Monday, it nearly ensures the funding lapse will reach the three-week mark at midnight Tuesday.Senate Majority Leader John Thune continued to force votes on the GOP-led stopgap, while Democratic senators showed no signs of breaking rank and voting in support, Politico reported.The same Democrats who had been voting against the legislation in recent days continued to cast “no” votes on Thursday to advance the measure that would fund the govt through November 21.Independent Senator Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with Democrats, voted again in support of the Republican-led stopgap, along with Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada.However, one new variable emerged this week that could help end the stalemate: Thune is hoping to initiate floor debate on individual spending bills that would fund federal agencies for a full year, starting with the Pentagon and possibly also the departments of Health and Human Services, Labor and Education.As the time of Shutdown extended, the cost on governmten would also increase.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that the ongoing government shutdown could be taking a heavy toll on the US economy.Speaking at a news conference, Bessent said the partial shutdown, now entering its third week, is “starting to cut into muscle here.”He initially suggested the shutdown could cost the economy as much as $15 billion per day, though the Treasury later clarified he meant $15 billion per week. The shutdown began on October 1 after Congress and the White House failed to pass a funding bill for fiscal year 2026, according to Fox Business.Bessent urged moderate Senate Democrats to “be heroes” by breaking with party leadership and supporting the Senate Republicans’ continuing resolution to reopen the government for Americans.Neither Republicans nor Democrats are ready to flinch in their deeply entrenched positions, and talks between both sides, though largely informal exercises, have begun to fade.A new AP-NORC poll shows Americans view it as a serious problem—and assign blame across the political spectrum.About 60% of respondents say President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans bear “a great deal” or “quite a bit” of responsibility, while 54% say the same about congressional Democrats. Overall, at least three-quarters of Americans hold each party accountable to some extent, signaling widespread frustration, AP news reported.The standoff has escalated over Democrats’ push to extend pandemic-era tax credits and Republicans’ refusal to negotiate without a funding bill.While both sides aim to cast blame on the other, the poll suggests the party in power faces slightly more public frustration, with half of Americans pointing to Trump as most responsible. Voters like Sophia Cole, a Republican from St. Louis, see blame on both sides but emphasize the president’s role in brokering a deal.The poll finds that 54% of adults call the shutdown a “major issue,” with just 11% saying it is “not a problem at all.” Democrats are most likely, at 69%, to see it as a major problem, but 59% of independents and 37% of Republicans feel the same way.","The Senate voted down the House-passed spending patch for the tenth time on Thursday.

VIDEO: Hamas Fighters Release Seven Israeli Hostages From Gaza Amid Loud Cheer From Palestinians





Hamas published a video on Monday showing eight blindfolded and kneeling men being executed in the streets, branding them ""collaborators and outlaws.""The footage surfaced amid armed clashes between Hamas security units and Palestinian clans, on the fifth day of a US-brokered truce between Israel and the militant group.Hamas proceeded to take control of Gaza on Tuesday, even as US President Donald Trump vowed to disarm the group under a recently brokered ceasefire.The Israeli military confirmed that the remains of four more hostages held in Gaza were handed to the Red Cross, following the release of four others and the safe return of 20 surviving captives.In northern Gaza, as Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza City, Hamas’s black-masked police resumed street patrols. Hamas’s Brigades helped control crowds when freed prisoners arrived in Gaza on Monday. A new Hamas security unit, called the Deterrence Force, has been targeting armed clans and gangs, some of which are said to have Israeli support.Hamas has dominated Gaza since 2007 after defeating rival faction Fatah. Israel insists Hamas must not play any role in a future Gaza government, hand back the remains of 24 deceased hostages, and eventually disarm.Trump has warned that those who refuse to surrender their weapons will be forcibly disarmed. The US-brokered 20-point peace plan, endorsed by world powers at a Trump-led summit in Egypt, demands a demilitarised Gaza and no leadership role for Hamas.Meanwhile, Israeli families continued pressing for the return of the remains of 24 hostages still held by Hamas.The Israeli army confirmed four more bodies were transferred to the Red Cross and on their way to custody. The military identified two victims as Guy Iluz, an Israeli national, and Bipin Joshi, an agriculture student from Nepal.

New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has reiterated his call for the city to “honour” the International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza.The Indian-origin politician has previously stated that, if elected mayor, he would “arrest” Netanyahu should the Israeli leader visit the city.""I’ve said that this is a city that believes international law, and this is a city that wants to uplift and uphold those beliefs,"" Mamdani told Fox News’ ""The Story"" show on Wednesday.Anchor Martha MacCallum noted that the US is not a signatory to the ICC, which Mamdani acknowledged. He stressed, however, that “The ICC… has issued a warrant for the arrest of Benjamin Netanyahu, as it has for Vladimir Putin (over alleged war crimes in Ukraine). I believe that we should uphold arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court and that we would… do so only in abiding with all of the laws in front of us. ”The Democratic candidate clarified that he would not create new legislation to arrest Netanyahu. “I can tell you that I’m going to exhaust every legal option in front of me, not to make new laws to do so,” he added, responding to a question about whether the NYPD would allow him to arrest the Israeli leader.During his recent US visit, Netanyahu avoided flying over countries that are ICC signatories and could have arrested him in their airspace.Mamdani, 33, who would become New York’s first Muslim mayor if elected and is a vocal critic of Donald Trump, also declined to credit the US president for last week’s ceasefire and hostage-prisoner swap between Israel and Hamas. “To any extent, credit or not, I think it's too early to say. But if it proves to be lasting and durable, then that’s where you give credit,” he said.He also avoided commenting directly on whether Hamas would “lay down their arms” in Gaza, emphasizing that his focus is on justice, safety, and adherence to international law. “Anything has to abide by international law, and that applies to Hamas, the Israeli military, anyone you could ask me about,” Mamdani remarked.The mayoral election in New York is scheduled for November 4. Mamdani faces Republican Curtis Silwa and former New York state governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent.","New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has reiterated his call for the city to ""honour"" the International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

The allegation

Why Bolton became a

Trump critic

Others facing Trump's wrath





Former US National Security Adviser (NSA) John Bolton, who served during Donald Trump’s first term and has since become a vocal critic, has been indicted on charges of ""mishandling classified information.""Bolton, 76, who served as the 26th NSA from April 2018 to September 2019, is the latest perceived “foe” of the Trump administration to face criminal charges in recent weeks.He also served as the US envoy to the United Nations - a post he held from August 2005 to December 2006 under George W Bush.The veteran diplomat was charged by a federal grand jury in Maryland with 18 counts of transmitting and retaining classified information, AFP reported.The 26-page indictment alleges that Bolton emailed “top secret documents” to ""two unauthorised individuals,"" believed to be his wife and daughter, using a non-government email or messaging app. The materials, described as “diary-life” entries about his work as NSA, total over 1,000 pages.According to the Justice Department, the documents “revealed intelligence about future attacks, foreign adversaries, and foreign-policy relations.”Attorney general Pam Bondi said in a statement, “Anyone who abuses a position of power and jeopardises our national security will be held accountable. No one is above the law.”Bolton rejected the charges in a statement to the media, saying, “I become the latest target in weaponising the Justice Department... with charges that were declined before or distort the facts.”Trump told reporters that his former aide is a “bad guy” and added, “that’s the way it goes.”Each of the 18 counts against the ex-NSA carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.In his statement, Bolton, who had been under FBI investigation and whose residence was raided in September, reflected on his time in Trump’s first administration, saying he “devoted my life to America’s foreign policy and national security and would never compromise those goals.”However, he added that he ""resigned"" when it become “impossible” for him to continue.Bolton also linked the indictment to his book, ""The Room Where It Happened,"" which was highly critical of Trump. “The retribution against me began then, continued when he tried unsuccessfully to block the publication of my book before the 2020 election, and became one of his rallying cries in his re-election campaign,” he remarked.The indictment follows the filing of criminal charges by the Justice Department against two other prominent Trump critics -New York attorney general Letitia James and former FBI director James Comey.James, who successfully prosecuted Trump for financial fraud, was indicted by a grand jury in Virginia on October 9 on charges of bank fraud and making false statements related to a property she purchased in 2020 in Norfolk, Virginia.Comey pleaded not guilty on October 8 to charges of making false statements to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding.Both have rejected the charges and alleged ""political retribution.""","Former US National Security Adviser (NSA) John Bolton has been indicted on charges of ""mishandling classified information"" The 76-year-old served as the 26th NSA from April 2018 to September 2019.

The US military reportedly carried out a new strike on an alleged drug-carrying vessel in the Caribbean on Thursday.However, unlike its five previous attacks that killed at least 27 suspected narco-terrorists, some crew members survived this latest operation, according to US officials cited by Reuters.More details are awaited as the Pentagon is yet to confirm the strike.The fifth such strike was conducted on October 14, killing six. The operations have been going on since last month against what the Trump administration has described as its ""war against narco-terrorism.""In some cases, the US president himself has posted videos of the strikes to his Truth Social platform and alleged the boats were carrying drugs.The operations have raised alarms among some legal experts and Democratic lawmakers, who question whether these adhere to the laws of war.

Who is Radule Bojovic?







Immigration and Customs Enforcement has arrested Radule Bojovic, a police officer from Hanover Park, a suburb approximately 35 miles west of Chicago, alleging he has been in the United States illegally after overstaying his visa.According to the ICE, Bojovic was arrested on October 15 while conducting targeted enforcement operations in Rolling Meadows.The ""illegal alien"" came in US as a B-2 visitor visa overstay, who was required to leave the country by March 31, 2015. He illegally overstayed his visa by more than 10 years.“Illegal aliens are prohibited from owning or possessing firearms — full stop,” said ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Chicago Field Office Director Sam Olson.“This is the second known instance in recent months of a local police department hiring an illegal alien and unlawfully issuing him a firearm while on duty in violation of federal law. It is alarming how local jurisdictions continue to disregard federal law to the detriment of their communities.”Bojovic admitted that he had no weapons on his person because he's only authorized to carry his firearm while on duty. As an alien illegally present in the United States, ICE officers immediately placed Bojovic under arrest.“Radule Bojovic violated our nation’s laws and was living ILLEGALLY in the United States for 10 years — what kind of police department gives criminal illegal aliens badges and guns? It’s a felony for aliens to even possess a firearm. A law enforcement officer who is actively breaking the law,” Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.“Under President Trump and Secretary Noem ICE is restoring law and order. Criminal illegal aliens have NO PLACE in our communities, especially on our police forces,” she added.The ICE, in a statement, slammed the Chicago Governor and said, ""This is just the latest instance of Governor JB Pritzker’s continued refusal to abide by federal laws, jeopardizing the welfare of Illinois residents.""Homeland security department secretary Kristi Noem said, ""Sanctuary-state Illinois, under @GovPritzker, is completely corrupt. @ICEgov arrested an illegal alien working as a sworn POLICE OFFICER in a Chicago suburb.

Senator Mitch McConnell had an unexpected “hall pass” on Thursday—literally.

Even seasoned politicians can’t escape the occasional stumble in the hallowed halls of Congress During the incident, an activist from the Sunrise Movement asked the senator whether he supports Immigration and Customs Enforcement “taking working people off the streets and kidnapping them,” before McConnell fell forward and landed on his side.The video captured his aide and a Capitol Police officer helping him up before McConnell turned to the camera and waved. A spokesman for McConnell told The Independent that the senator is “all good.”McConnell, the longest-serving party leader in the upper chamber’s history, has been under intense scrutiny regarding his health following several public incidents where he appeared to freeze while speaking to reporters.Earlier this year, he reportedly suffered two falls and experienced a similar incident in December inside the Capitol, resulting in minor injuries. McConnell, who has walked with a limp after recovering from polio at a young age, returned to the Senate shortly after with a bandage on his cheek.In 2023, McConnell froze while speaking on at least two occasions and was absent from the Senate for weeks after tripping at a Washington dinner, sustaining a concussion and a minor rib fracture. Last year, Senator John Thune succeeded McConnell as the Senate Republican leader, ending an 18-year tenure as the party leader in the upper chamber.",The 83-year-old Kentucky Republican briefly collapsed in the Capitol corridors while heading to the Senate.

Bangladesh, Canada or US: Where will Shahriar go?









Mahin Shahriar, a Bangladeshi man seeking asylum in Canada, has been arrested by the ICE in Buffalo after he was found in the US illegally, though he said he crossed the border by mistake. Canadian authorities said they won't take him back, the Canadian Press reported. The situation which led the man to US soil was strange as Shahriar said he was asked by a friend to reach the location. He said as he was suffering from depression and wanted some time out of his home, he was offered help by his friend who sent him to a particular location. But the location was near the border, on US soil.Shahriar said he has been in Canada since 2019 and worked as an Uber driver to support his family in Canada, which includes his mother, also a refugee, and his sister who is attending school in Canada full-time. Shahriar said he wanted to spend some time alone and a friend offered a place.The place was close to the Canada-US border, Shahriar found out as he was following the instructions of his friend over a phone call. ""Then I found myself in the US. It was not my intention,"" he said.When Shahriar understood that he was in the US, he approached the border patrol officers to explain his situation but he was taken into custody.ICE reportedly told Shahriar's lawyer Washim Ahmed that they won't compel Canada to accept Shahriar.They can't deport Shahriar to Bangladesh as they don't have his travel documents. Also, Shahriar is at risk of torture and detention if he returns to Bangladesh, they said.Ahmed said he is working to schedule an urgent Federal Court hearing to press the CBSA (Canada Border Services Agency) to accept Shahriar’s transfer to Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.“Regardless of what status he may have had prior to leaving Canada, he was a resident of Canada,” Ahmed said. “He was the resident of Canada and he had his first blood family member in Canada, his sister and his mother. Both of them are maintaining valid legal status.”Shahriar signed US immigration documents on September 24, saying he is not seeking protection in the US due to his family being approved for asylum in Canada and his own pending asylum application.","Mahin Shahriar, a Bangladeshi man seeking asylum in Canada, has been arrested by the ICE in Buffalo.

'U.S.-RUSSIA Ties Will Be Hit Significantly': Putin Warns Trump On Tomahawks For Ukraine

What are Tomahawk missiles?





Renewed focus









US President Donald Trump said he had a “very productive” phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin , describing it as a step towards ending the war in Ukraine.The two leaders agreed to hold a meeting of senior advisers next week, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, with Trump and Putin set to meet later in Budapest, Hungary. Trump said he will also meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office tomorrow.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said Putin had congratulated him and the United States on the “Great Accomplishment of Peace in the Middle East,” calling it something “dreamed of for centuries.” Trump added, “I actually believe that the Success in the Middle East will help in our negotiation in attaining an end to the War with Russia/Ukraine.”Trump also said that Putin thanked First Lady Melania Trump for her “involvement with children” and expressed appreciation for her efforts.Earlier today, Trump said he was holding a phone call with Putin. Trump announced the call on Truth Social, stating he would provide an update afterwards.The conversation comes just before Trump’s scheduled meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday, where missile support is expected to top the agenda.Zelenskyy has argued that equipping Kyiv with Tomahawks—capable of striking deep into Russian territory—could push Putin towards serious negotiations.On Sunday, during a visit to Israel, Trump said he intended to raise the missile issue with Putin, adding, “Do they want to have Tomahawks going in that direction? I don’t think so.”Tomahawk missiles are long-range, precision-guided cruise missiles used by the US military. Developed in the 1970s, they have been a key weapon in numerous conflicts, first used in combat during the 1991 Gulf War. These missiles are launched from ships or land-based platforms and can travel over 1,000 miles at speeds of up to 550 mph, making them highly effective for striking distant targets.With advanced guidance systems, they can navigate around obstacles and avoid enemy defences.Typically, Tomahawks carry warheads equivalent to around 400 pounds of TNT. Their ability to fly at low altitudes and high speeds makes them difficult to detect by radar. These capabilities make them a valuable asset in modern warfare.Following the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, Trump has shifted focus to ending the war in Ukraine, central to his 2024 re-election bid. Despite past frustrations with Putin, Trump expressed renewed confidence: “Interestingly we made progress today, because of what’s happened in the Middle East.”Trump is also weighing further economic pressure on Russia. Zelenskyy is expected to urge additional sanctions. While Trump has resisted sweeping measures, he claimed India had agreed to stop buying Russian oil—a key revenue source for Moscow.Meanwhile, the White House is quietly reviewing Senate legislation imposing heavy tariffs on Russian exports. Though Trump hasn’t publicly backed it, officials say it aligns with his foreign policy—provided it offers “complete flexibility.”","US President Donald Trump said he had a “very productive” phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
