11 bases were damaged in Pakistan

The Indian forces struck various ammunition depots and bases like Sagodha and Bholari, which housed F-16s and JF-17 fighter jets were hit. This led to the destruction of 20% infrastructure of Pakistan's air force.

India bombed Pakistan’s Bholari Air Base, killing over 50 people, including Pakistan’s squadron leader Usman Yousuf, 4 airmen among others as well as destroying Pakistan’s fighter jets.

Throughout Operation Sindoor, multiple terror and military locations across Pakistan were attacked by India.

Army Details How India Eliminated Nearly 40 Pak Soldiers In Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir and other border areas remained largely peaceful on the intervening night of May 11 and 12, approximately two days after ceasefire talks.Meanwhile, Indian forces on Sunday released satellite pictures of bases (before and after) in Pakistan and Pok that suffered heavy losses after India's ' Operation Sindoor .'

These facilities were key command centres for Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), responsible for attacks like Pulwama (2019) and Mumbai (2008).""""In response to Pakistan’s retaliatory drone and missile attacks on May 7, 8 and 9th 2025, targeting multiple Indian cities and military installations, India launched kamikaze drones to destroy Pakistani air defences across the country, including neutralising air defence system of Lahore,"" the statement from Indian forces added.On the intervening night of May 9 and May 10, India’s counter-military actions damaged major air force camps of Pakistan. ""Within 3 hours 11 bases were attacked, including Nur Khan, Rafiqui, Murid, Sukkur, Sialkot, Pasrur, Chunian, Sargodha, Skaru, Bholari and Jacobabad,"" it added.The scale of destruction can be clearly seen in the before and after photos of Shahbaz airbase at Jacobabad.","Satellite images reveal Operation Sindoor’s impact on Pakistan air bases, terror camps.

NEW DELHI: India will hit terrorists in Pakistan, external affairs minister S Jaishankar told US secretary of state Marco Rubio in a phone call on May 1 after the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam on April 22, which killed 26 people.""We will hit the terrorists in Pakistan, and there should be no doubt about it,"" Jaishankar told Rubio, according to ANI citing sources.

NEW DELHI: India successfully managed to achieve three main objectives - political, military and psychological - from the May 7 military strikes , according to government sources.""The military aim was, as the PM said, terrorists ko mitti mein mila denge. That was achieved in Bahawalpur, Muridke and Muzaffarabad. The political was to raise the cost of terrorism for Pakistan and to keep Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance till Pakistan stops promoting cross-border terrorism .And the psychological objective was 'ghar mein ghus ke marenge' and that no place is safe for you. All three were successfully achieved,"" the source said.Also read: India agreed to pause as 'main objectives had already been achieved' The sources said India's military strikes on terrorist camps marked a new normal in ties - that LoC or nuclear threat could no longer be used to carry out terrorist attacks in India. They stressed that India was determined from the day of the Pahalgam attack that it would hit Pakistan's terror factory, with the PM asking armed forces to respond to every 'goli' (bullet) with a 'gola' (cannonball).While admitting that US Vice President J D Vance spoke to PM Modi on May 9, government sources said even after the talks, Pakistan targeted 26 places in India at night, after which Indian armed forces hit back hard.Government sources also said the Indian DGMO had spoken to his Pakistani counterpart minutes after the May 7 strikes. He is learnt to have told him that India had hit terrorist camps and was ready to talk. The Pakistani DGMO that day showed no interest in engaging India on the military situation, but came around after India rained ""hell fire"" on May 10.According to Indian authorities, while violence has stopped, Operation Sindoor is still not over and the Indus Waters Treaty will remain in abeyance till the time Pakistan stops cross-border terrorism. Modi is learnt to have conveyed India's resolve to bring the perpetrators to justice in a conversation with US President Donald Trump on April 22 itself, while he was in Saudi Arabia on the day of the Pahalgam attack, and external affairs minister S Jaishankar told his counterpart Marco Rubio on May 1 that India would hit at terror camps in Pakistan.At a briefing on Sunday, director general of air operations Air Marshal A K Bharti made it clear that the calibrated strikes on the Pakistan airbases and radar sites were undertaken after Pakistan upped the ante by relentlessly launching waves of drone attacks to target Indian airbases, military assets and civilian areas.Also read: 'Decided to strike where it would hurt': Air Marshal AK Bharti gives details of India's retaliatory strikes on Pakistan airbases Displaying ""before and after"" satellite and other images to show how some of the bases were hit multiple times, he said there was major damage to runways, aircraft hangers and base infrastructure at other Pakistan airbases like Sargodha, which houses F-16 jets, Skardu, Jacobabad, Bholari, Sukkur and Rahim Yar Khan as well.""To start with, our fight was only with the terrorists and not with the Pak Army. But we were relentlessly attacked and left with no choice,"" Air Marshal Bharti said.A NOTAM (notice to airmen), incidentally, has been issued by Pakistan, saying that the only runway at the Rahim Yar Khan base would be ""not be available for flight operations"" for at least a week.""Even more than the actual damage, the messaging that we can hit the heartland of Pakistan was the key. The strikes were precise in order to not cause collateral damage to civilian infrastructure,"" another senior officer told TOI.In all, the IAF fighters targeted nine airbases - the others being Rafiqui and Murid - as well as radar sites at Pasrur, Chunian and Sialkot aviation bases, as was reported by TOI earlier.Air Marshal Bharti did not specify the precision strike weapons used in the operation. Sources, however, said IAF deployed the twin-engine Sukhoi-30MKI fighters armed with the BrahMos missiles, whose range has been extended from 290 to 450-km, among other jets and weapons, for the mission that did not involve crossing the Line of Control or the international boundary.Other weapons included Crystal Maze-2 missiles, Scalp air-to-ground cruise missiles, Hammer air-to-ground precision-guided munitions and Spice-2000 precision-guided bombs.The Sukhois, with a combat radius of almost 1,500-km without mid-air refuelling, and the extended range BrahMos, which flies almost three times the speed of sound at Mach 2.8, together constitute a decidedly deadly weapons package.Around 40 Sukhoi fighters have also been modified to carry the BrahMos missiles. The IAF has been practising air-to-ground precision strikes against high-value targets from long stand-off distances in the Bay of Bengal for quite some time now.This time, the strike mission was across the frontier with Pakistan. ""The IAF has successfully executed its assigned tasks in Operation Sindoor, with precision and professionalism.

JAMMU: An uneasy calm descended Sunday on the forward areas along the international border and LoC in J&K’s Jammu division after days of heavy shelling by Pakistan, including for a few hours after a pause was declared on military operations.Residents of towns and villages in Rajouri, Poonch, Jammu, Samba and Udhampur gingerly got back to work amid confirmation that there was no ceasefire violation and drone activity from across the LoC since midnight.“With Pakistan, you never know.

Air Force conducts precision strikes on multiple Pakistani airbases; satellite imagery reveals damage to key infrastructure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/air-force-conducts-precision-strikes-on-multiple-pakistani-airbases-satellite-imagery-reveals-damage-to-key-infrastructure/articleshow/121080171.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Air Force (IAF) conducted coordinated precision strikes on at least four Pakistani airbases on May 10, with satellite imagery confirming significant damage to infrastructure and ground assets. As per sources, the attacks were carried out using advanced air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs), likely the BrahMos.Imagery released by Indian space analytics firm KawaSpace confirms a direct hit on a hangar at Pakistan Air Force’s Bholari Airbase.Debris and structural damage were visible, with the strike's proximity to the runway suggesting that the targeted hangar may have had a quick reaction alert (QRA) role.At Shahbaz Airbase in Jacobabad, another precision strike reportedly hit a hangar on the main apron. KawaSpace imagery also suggests possible secondary damage to the air traffic control (ATC) building at the site.Sargodha Airbase was also struck, though the extent of damage has not been officially disclosed. KawaSpace provided updated runway imagery but has withheld additional assessments pending verification.Imagery from a Chinese satellite firm, MizazVision, appears to confirm that Pakistan’s Nur Khan Airbase was targeted as well. The Indian Air Force strike reportedly focused on disabling ground support vehicles and critical infrastructure on site.These strikes follow escalating military tensions and are part of India's broader Operation Sindoor , which aims to neutralize cross-border terror infrastructure .Earlier in the evening, in a rare joint press briefing by all three defence services, Air Marshal AK Bharti emphasized that the Indian response was deliberately focused on high-value targets. “A decision was taken to strike where it would hurt,” he said, outlining how Indian forces carried out a swift, coordinated, and calibrated assault on key Pakistani military infrastructure.The targets included airbases at Chaklala, Rafiq, and Rahim Yar Khan, followed by strikes on Sargodha, Bhulari, and Jacobabad. These strikes, Bharti added, were meant to send a clear message: “Aggression will not be tolerated.”Bharti also confirmed that the Indian Air Force thwarted an attempted breach of Indian airspace by Pakistani fighter jets following India’s cross-border counterterror strikes under ‘Operation Sindoor’.“Their planes were prevented from entering our borders. We have definitely downed a few planes and inflicted losses on their side,” Bharti said, assuring that all Indian pilots involved in the operation had returned safely.The briefing came as all three wings of India’s armed forces shed light on Operation Sindoor, the large-scale military response launched on May 7 following the Pakistan-backed terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people.","The Indian Air Force (IAF) conducted coordinated precision strikes on at least four Pakistani airbases on May 10.

NEW DELHI: Air Marshal AK Bharti on Sunday briefed on Operation Sindoor and said that the armed forces successfully destroyed terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir achieving its objectives with precision.During a press briefing regarding Operation Sindoor, he said the results were evident to the world.Regarding the operation, Air Marshal Bharti said, ""Have we achieved our objectives of decimating the terrorist camps, and the answer is a thumping yes, and the results are for the whole world to see.""The Air Marshal further added that the operation was aimed at hitting designated targets with precision, ""not to count the body bags,"" referring to the matter of the number of estimated casualties.""Whatever methods and whatever means we have chosen, it had the desired effects on the enemy targets. How many casualties? How many injuries? Our aim was not to inflict casualties, but in case there have been, it is for them to count. Our job is to hit the target, not to count the body bags,"" the Marshal said.DGMO Lieutenant General Rajiv Ghai said that armed forces killed more than 100 terrorists including high value targets.""Those strikes across those nine terror hubs left more than 100 terrorists killed, including high-value targets such as Yusuf Azhar, Abdul Malik Rauf and Mudasir Ahmed, who were involved in the hijack of IC814 and the Pulwama blast,"" the DGMO said.The Marshal said the Indian Armed Forces successfully executed Operation Sindoor, achieving all selected objectives, with all Indian pilots returning safely.""All I can say is that we have achieved our objectives that we selected and all our pilots are back home,"" he said.Air Marshal Bharti confirmed that the Indian Air Force had downed several Pakistani planes while preventing enemy aircraft from breaching Indian airspace.""Their planes were prevented from entering inside our border.

Definitely, there are losses on their side which we have inflicted,"" he said.DGMO Lieutenant General Rajiv Ghai said that Pakistan's actions were ""no less than war"". He also said that the Pakistan Army may be involved in the infiltration across LoC.""The activities that have been going on for the last 3–4 days are no less than a war. Under normal circumstances, the air forces of each other's countries do not fly in the air and attack each other. Under normal circumstances, infiltration across the Line of Control is done by terrorists. We have information that the Pakistani army may also be involved in infiltration across the Line of Control, which is trying to harm our posts,"" the Lieutenant General said.Foreign secretary Vikram Misri on Saturday said that Pakistan’s military contacted India earlier in the day, and both sides agreed to stop all military action on land, at sea, and in the air starting from 5 pm.He added that orders were given to enforce the ceasefire, and another meeting between the two countries will take place on May 12 at noon.Hours after the ceasefire was announced, Pakistan reportedly violated it again, with Indian air defence intercepting Pakistani drones during a blackout in Srinagar.India urged Pakistan to take proper action to stop the violations and handle the situation seriously and responsibly. Earlier, Pakistan was also warned that any future act of terrorism against India would be treated as an ""act of war.""The Indian Armed Forces launched Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7, targeting nine terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoK).The strike came in response to the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, which killed 26 civilians.After India’s action, tensions between India and Pakistan increased sharply. This led to more cross-border shelling from Pakistan, with India responding in kind.Several areas near the border were placed on high alert, and blackouts were reported during Pakistani attacks.","The Indian Armed Forces launched Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7, targeting nine terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoK) The strike came in response to the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, which killed 26 civilians.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121083185,imgsize-452422,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
"If Pakistan does anything more, our response will be far stronger, PM Modi told US VP Vance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/if-pakistan-does-anything-more-our-response-will-be-far-stronger-pm-modi-told-us-vp/articleshow/121090504.cms,"PM Modi and JD Vance (File photo)

NEW DELHI: PM Modi is learnt to have told US vice-president J D Vance on Friday, ""If they (Pakistan) do anything more, our response will be far stronger"" when the latter called him up to convey what US intelligence had gathered about Pakistan's intent to massively escalate hostilities.If Vance had expected that his dire message about the offensive intent of a nuclear-armed country would get Modi to lower the ante, he was mistaken.So, when Pakistan indeed widened the theatre a few hours later, India struck back by carrying out precision strikes at multiple PAF airbases, laying bare its air defence.The successful execution of Modi's intent was what forced Pakistan to approach India for pausing hostilities. India agreed, but after laying down its 'if you don't act, we don't act; but if you act, we react strongly' bottomline.Sources also feel Pakistan's alleged threat, which dramatically moved Vance from terming the conflict as ""fundamentally none of our business"" just a day before to playing the concerned mediator, may have been part of its by now familiar playbook to tap into the West's fears of a nuclear conflagration.New Delhi, however, did not indulge Washington's activism. Sources said external affairs minister S Jaishankar made it clear to US secretary of state Marco Rubio that if Pakistan wanted to talk, it could directly approach the DGMO here.Faced with the strong and effective response of our armed forces, they (Pakistan) ran to their uncle to seek its intervention,” a senior source said on what could have led the US to junk its ‘it is for them to sort it out’ aloofness to seek to play the firefighter.As the pause in conflict took effect, there is satisfaction here that Pakistan’s plan to drum up support by painting doomsday scenarios of nukes flying did not work. It failed to rally the Muslim nations, with deputy foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, Adel Al Jubeir, visiting New Delhi as a mark of solidarity. “They were upset that the mass killings happened in Pahalgam during PM Modi’s visit (to Saudi Arabia) and conveyed the message that they were ready to help if needed,” the source said.Sources pointed out Iran was also sympathetic towards India. Algeria, an Islamic country which, like Pakistan, is a non-permanent member of UNSC, was party to resolution which stressed the “need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of the reprehensible act of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice”. Malaysia, another Muslim-majority nation, was equally forthright in its condemnation, sources said.Pakistan’s success in getting references to The Resistance Front, the LeT proxy, which had claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam massacre, dropped turned out to be a pyrrhic victory, the sources said. “We only had to draw the attention of other countries to this and they agreed with our stand because we had been flagging TRF since 2022,” a senior govt functionary said.","PM Modi is learnt to have told US vice-president J D Vance on Friday, ""If they (Pakistan) do anything more, our response will be far stronger"" The successful execution of Modi's intent was what forced Pakistan to approach India for pausing hostilities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121090733,imgsize-785368,width-400,resizemode-4/article-16.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Vice Admiral AN Pramod on Sunday said that in the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack , the Indian Navy immediately mobilised its carrier battle group into the northern Arabian Sea in full combat readiness, adopting what he called a ""decisive and deterrent posture.""Speaking at a joint press briefing alongside Army and Air Force officials, he confirmed that the Indian Navy had remained forward deployed with the capability to strike high-value targets, including Pakistan’s financial capital, Karachi, under Operation Sindoor “In the aftermath of the cowardly attacks on innocent tourists at Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir by Pakistani-sponsored terrorists on 22nd April, the Indian Navy's Carrier battle group, surface forces, submarines and aviation assets were immediately deployed at sea with full combat readiness,” said Vice Admiral Pramod.“We tested and refined tactics and procedures at sea during multiple weapon firings in the Arabian Sea within 96 hours of the terrorist attack,” he added.Vice Admiral also mentioned that Pakistan’s naval and air units were forced into a largely defensive stance, retreating to harbours or staying close to the coastline, movements that Indian forces continuously monitored.“Our forces remained forward deployed in the Northern Arabian Sea in a decisive and deterrent posture with full readiness and capacity to strike select targets at sea and on land, including Karachi, at a time of our choosing,” he said.Vice Admiral Pramod highlighted the measured approach adopted by India. “Our response has been measured, proportionate, non-escalatory and responsible from day one,” he said. “As we speak, the Indian Navy remains deployed at sea in a credible deterrent posture to respond decisively to any inimical action by Pakistan.”Delivering a pointed warning, he stated, “This time if Pakistan dares to take any action, Pakistan knows what we are going to do.”The briefing came just a day after Pakistan approached India with a proposal for a full ceasefire across land, air, and sea an understanding it violated later the same evening.All three branches of India’s armed forces, Army, Navy, and Air Force, addressed the media to provide a detailed account of Operation Sindoor, the military response launched on May 7 in retaliation for the Pakistan-backed attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which claimed 26 lives.Pakistan responded to India’s counterterror operation with a swarm of drones and missile incursions over the subsequent days. However, India’s air defence systems acted swiftly and effectively, neutralising the threats and preventing any casualties or damage.Ironically, even as these hostilities unfolded, Pakistan reached out to India on Saturday, proposing a full ceasefire across land, air, and sea. The request, made via a call from Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations to his Indian counterpart, was positioned as a step toward de-escalation.Yet, within hours of this outreach, Pakistan breached the very peace agreement it had proposed, casting a shadow over the credibility of its peace overture.","Vice Admiral AN Pramod said that in the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack, the Indian Navy immediately mobilised its carrier battle group into the northern Arabian Sea in full combat readiness. “Our response has been measured, proportionate, non-escalatory and responsible from day one,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121083062,imgsize-982686,width-400,resizemode-4/untd-5.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: A Squadron Leader was among five Pakistan Air Force (PAF) personnel killed at Bholari in Sindh while the Rahim Yar Khan airbase housed within the international airport of the same name in Punjab province suffered massive damage in coordinated Indian missile strikes targeting the country’s air defence infrastructure, authorities confirmed Sunday after taking stock of the impact of India’s “retaliatory” action early on May 10.The missile fired at Rahim Yar Khan airbase caused a massive crater on the portion of the runway, the district deputy commissioner said.Sources acknowledged that the attack in the dead of night had been timed to avoid civilian casualties. Although passenger flights to and from the airport have since resumed, the missile strike has severely limited the military operations from the airbase.Pakistani officials emphasise Rahim Yar Khan’s strategic role in southern air defences, close to India’s Rajasthan border. They contested India’s statement that a wave of drones launched from the airbase to attack border villages invited the strong missile retaliation.The PAF casualties at Base Bholari in Sindh’s Jamshoro district included Sq Ldr Usman Yousaf and four others in uniform. The base supports F-16 and JF-17 fighter jets, critical to Pakistan’s southern air operations. Pakistani authorities didn’t specify the material losses. Indian media reports, unverified by Pakistan, suggest damage to aircraft and infrastructure.Pakistani officials also confirmed simultaneous attacks on Nur Khan airbase at Chaklala in Rawalpindi, Rafiqui airbase at Shorkot in Punjab), Murid airbase in Chakwal and Chunian airbase in Punjab. They mentioned damage to transport aircraft at Nur Khan and technical facilities at Chunian.India officially named eight PAF bases, including radar sites in Pasrur and Sialkot. Pakistan’s “Operation Bunyan-ul-Marsoos” targeting Indian sites didn’t cause significant damage, the Indian military said in its first official presser since a pause in military operations.","A Squadron Leader was among five Pakistan Air Force (PAF) personnel killed at Bholari in Sindh.

This came even as the opposition party has offered its support to the government in its efforts against terrorism after the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 people on April 22.""At a time when the nation stands united as Indians, this petty attempt to divide us politically is deplorable. Our government has learned the futility of past approaches the hard way -- after inviting Pakistan to participate in the investigation of the Pathankot blasts in 2016. It is only then that it took to the path of military action, carefully calibrated and maturely conducted. This advertisement is neither appropriate nor mature. Delete it, please, @BJP4India,"" Tharoor said in a post on X. BJP posted a video on X criticising the UPA regime for its ""passivity"" and calling it out on its ""futile peace talks"" with Pakistan.""The message to the enemies is loud and clear. Don't mess with us! Unlike the UPA regime’s passivity, New India has no patience for futile peace talks,"" it said.Tharoor's reaction comes at a time when his appreciation for the Modi-government in certain foreign policies made headlines fueling rumours of rift with the grand old party. BJP leader Amit Malviya even took a jibe at him calling him PM Modi's fan after he sided with the current government's stance on Russia-Ukraine policy. ""Prime Minister Modi needs new haters… Old ones are turning into his fans,"" Malviya had said.Additionally, his presence at Vizhinjam port inauguration and sharing stage with PM Modi gained attention after the prime minister said that the event would give ""sleepless nights to several people"" taking a jibe at INDIA bloc.However, BJP leader CR Kesavan criticised Congress saying, ""We salute the exemplary courage and unparalleled commitment of our brave armed forces in decisively defeating the cowardly attacks of Pakistan on Bharat and our civilians...But unfortunately, the poisonous political propaganda of the Congress Party and their noxious fake narratives have now been weaponised by the enemy state of Pakistan...After Operation Sindoor commenced, Udit Raj of the Congress Party gave the name Operation Sindoor a communal colour. So the Congress Party is failing the nation again and again. It's high time they stop politicising the army and stop their fake factory of false narratives...""Meanwhile, India and Pakistan have agreed to stop the military action against each other with the former categorically maintaining ""a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations"".""India and Pakistan have today worked out an understanding on stoppage of firing and military action. India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.

JAISALMER: A bomb disposal squad of the Indian Army safely detonated a powerful Pakistani missile warhead found in Badoda village of Rajasthan's Jaisalmer district on Sunday, capping a pause in hostilities that had kept the border area on the edge for over three days.The warhead, containing live ammunition, was discovered in a farmer's field after India's air defence system intercepted and shot down a Pakistani missile Saturday night, causing its debris to land in Badoda.The operation to detonate the unexploded warhead was conducted after cordoning off a large area to ensure there was no damage. A deep pit was excavated before the disposal team safely destroyed the warhead.The explosion was so loud that vibrations were felt some distance away as clouds of smoke and dust filled the sky, locals said.Officials said that had the warhead exploded on landing, it would have potentially caused a large number of casualties and extensive damage to property. SP Sudhir Chaudhary and officials from Jaisalmer Civil Defence oversaw the detonation with members of the Army brass.Chaudhary had issued a public advisory not to handle any discovered ordnance and to immediately report to the nearest police station if villagers found munition or any explosive.

NEW DELHI: A high-level judicial panel, inquiring into the discovery of a huge amount of cash at the official residence of HC judge Yashwant Varma on March 14 night, in its report to CJI Sanjiv Khanna has suspected the judge’s personal staff for the mysterious disappearance of the cash.The inquiry panel comprising Punjab and Haryana chief justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC’s Justice Anu Sivaraman recorded the statements of the judge’s private secretary and staff, security personnel posted at his residence as well as fire and police personnel on the fire incident at the Tughlaq Crescent bungalow, the official residence of then Delhi HC judge Varma.All personnel among the first responders were unequivocal that they made videos of burning cash as well as sacks of cash untouched by the leaping flames of the fire that broke out at the storeroom within the judge’s residential premises and left the place without seizing any of the cash, either burnt or unburnt.Delhi HC Chief Justice D K Upadhyay, on being informed about the incident by the Delhi Police commissioner at 4.50pm on March 15, had instructed his registrar-cum-secretary to visit Justice Varma’s residence and inspect the place of fire. On reaching the residence, he was taken to Justice Varma by the latter’s private secretary.Justice Varma took the CJ’s secretary to the room, which was adjacent to the judge’s official residence. He found that though burnt articles and debris were in the room, there was no sign of any cash, burnt or unburnt.The inquiry panel recorded that the fire service was alerted by police, who got the first call about the incident at the judge’s residence at 11.35pm on March 14.They reached the spot at 11.43pm, doused the fire and left the scene at 1.56am on March 15. The panel also found that shortly thereafter police personnel, who videographed the incident, also left the house, leaving behind the cash as it were in the room. Security personnel posted at the judge’s residence informed the panel that Justice Varma’s private secretary and personal staff stayed back. The panel said it is prima facie of the opinion that the cash disappeared from the room in the early hours of March 15 and that the fire scene was cleared of all burnt and unburnt notes, which could not have been done without the knowledge and involvement of the judge’s private secretary and personal staff.However, the panel said it would require a formal investigation to summon witnesses and record their statements, which cannot be done by the informal inquiry panel as it had not been conferred with powers to probe as per the criminal procedure code. It is to be seen whether Delhi HC initiates any disciplinary proceedings against the judge’s private secretary based on the inquiry panel’s prima facie findings.CJI Khanna had forwarded the inquiry report to Justice Varma seeking his response and with a suggestion that he should quit judgeship. Justice Varma refused to quit, forcing the CJI to send the inquiry report along with the judge’s response to the President and the PM for formal initiation of a removal motion against him.Justice Varma was repatriated from Delhi HC to Allahabad HC, his parent high court, immediately after the constitution of the inquiry panel and has been stripped of judicial work.","A high-level judicial panel, inquiring into the discovery of a huge amount of cash at the official residence of HC judge Yashwant Varma on March 14 night, has suspected the judge’s personal staff for the mysterious disappearance of the cash.

NEW DELHI: Buoyed by his ""mediation"" of what he described as a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, President Donald Trump waded into the J&K issue as well, saying he would work with both sides to find a solution, an offer India dismissed offhand although not in an official statement. Official sources here stressed India's position on the Union Territory has not changed and, as it has repeatedly said in the recent past, the only thing left to be achieved is the return of POK that remains under Pakistan's illegal occupation.The govt also ruled out any talks with Pakistan, in line with its long-held policy that talks and terror can't go together, following US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's statement that both countries had agreed to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.A top source also called upon Pakistan to hand over terrorists wanted in India. ""What is it that we can talk to Pakistan about in the current circumstances? Hand over these terrorists to us and then we'll talk,"" he said. ""As for J&K, our stance has not changed. We are not going to discuss it with Pakistan,"" he added.Even during his previous term, Trump had offered to mediate on the Kashmir issue but with the qualifier that both sides had to agree to it. Complimenting both countries for their decision to stop fighting, and in remarks that were seen as drawing an equivalence between India and Pakistan, Trump said on this occasion, “I will work with you both to see if, after a ‘thousand years’, a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir.”Indian authorities also emphasised that it was only through the conversation between the DGMOs on Saturday that they reached an understanding with Pakistan to end the violence.While Trump said millions could have died, suggesting the US might have been spooked by Pakistan’s nuclear weapon threat, govt sources said Pakistan can no longer use the same to deter India from acting against terrorists.Another senior source speaking on condition of anonymity said India did not indulge in any “shuttle diplomacy” after the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22. “It wasn’t like the Parliament attack after which one-fourth of the US Senate was in India and another one-fourth in Pakistan (to defuse tensions). We always maintained that we will hit Pakistan if it chooses to escalate,” he said.“The message through Operation Sindoor was that no place in Pakistan is safe for terrorists. Nobody is untouchable,” he added.","President Donald Trump waded into the J&K issue as well, saying he would work with both sides to find a solution.

(Inputs from Chandigarh, Amritsar, Bathinda, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Jaipur, Gandhinagar)

Border districts of Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat began a tentative return to normalcy Sunday following a pause in military action between India and Pakistan late Saturday.Blackouts, widespread across several districts Saturday night, were scaled back or lifted Sunday as residents cautiously resumed daily life. Though drone sightings and sporadic reports of explosions persisted in some pockets, streets, markets and places of worship buzzed with restrained optimism.Punjab, with a 553km border with Pakistan, endured heavy drone and missile attacks Thursday and Friday.Cities close to the border, such as Jalandhar, Kapurthala, and Bathinda , which reported drone sightings, lifted blackouts Sunday but continued urging residents to shut off outdoor lights voluntarily. Hoshiarpur ordered a blackout from 9.30pm.In Amritsar and Pathankot, unconfirmed reports of flying objects and sounds of explosions persisted into early Sunday.UAVs were also spotted in nonborder districts such as Patiala, Bathinda, Faridkot and Jalandhar, where residents were advised against bursting firecrackers, flying drones, or spreading unverified messages. Border districts of Amritsar, Pathankot, Gurdaspur, Ferozepur, Tarn Taran and Fazilka saw a mixed picture Sunday. Temple bells rang and streets buzzed with life after days of fear and drone attacks. While malls and restaurants stayed active during daylight hours, voluntary blackouts were observed after 8pm.Amritsar resident Gurkirat Singh said: “We celebrated too soon. One moment we’re praying, the next we’re hiding in the dark.” Unconfirmed reports of drones and explosions Saturday night stirred fear in Amritsar and Pathankot. “Seeing projectiles streak across the sky was terrifying,” said Poornima Malhotra, a teacher from Pathankot. Shopkeeper Pawan Kumar from Gurdaspur remained uneasy. “What if the May 12 talks between India and Pakistan fail? Could war resume?” he asked.According to BSF officers, resumption of ceremonial parades at Attari, Hussainiwala and Sadiqi check posts remains undecided, as does pilgrim corridor to Kartarpur.Punjab education minister Harjot Singh Bains said all educational institutions statewide would reopen Monday, though DCs in border areas retained discretion. Schools in Pathankot, Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Ferozepur, Tarn Taran, Barnala, Fazilka and Sangrur will remain shut Monday “by way of abundant caution”, a government official said.In Haryana’s Ambala district, which was under blackout Friday and Saturday, restrictions were lifted Sunday. District magistrate Ajay Singh Tomer advised citizens to avoid using outdoor lights powered by generators or inverters but allowed normal power use inside homes.In Rajasthan, districts along the border saw a cautious reopening. Markets resumed in Jaisalmer, Barmer, Sriganganagar, Bikaner, Jodhpur and Phalodi after four tense days. Night blackouts remained in place in most districts due to fresh drone sightings and fears of renewed hostilities. Jaisalmer collector Pratap Singh authorised daily activities to resume, while Bikaner and Sriganganagar enforced blackout hours until May 12.Phalodi and Jodhpur, which saw consecutive blackout nights, reported no alerts Sunday and showed early signs of recovery. “The past four days were filled with uncertainty but Sunday remained normal,” said Phalodi collector Harji Lal Atal. Barmer collector Tina Dabi confirmed drone activity Saturday night but said no damage had occurred.Gujarat’s Kutch district, too, showed signs of easing. Commercial establishments in Bhuj, Lakhpat, Naliya, Adipur and Khavda remained open Sunday with no new drone sightings. A large crowd gathered at Bhuj’s main square to hail armed forces for defending border towns. Though blackout directives were lifted Saturday evening, brief drone activity prompted renewed surveillance by local authorities.","Border districts of Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat began a tentative return to normalcy Sunday following a pause in military action between India and Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: A day after India and Pakistan announced a stoppage of military activity, posts on the face-off continue to swamp social media.Getting suddenly into 'pause' mode drew another groan of disappointment from the Right, especially in the manner it came about. Noted columnist Swapan Dasgupta, a member of BJP national executive with 1.1 million X followers, posted, ""This ceasefire/'understanding' hasn't gone down well in India for (at least) 2 reasons: 1) It was peremptorily announced by Trump who suddenly appeared out of nowhere & pronounced his verdict 2) It is clear that Pakistan still sees terror strikes against Bharat as a virtuous act, even if it is regarded as an act of war.""Former foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal, now chancellor of JNU, also expressed displeasure on X underlining that Pakistan had been let off.He stated, ""At the international level the issue of Pak involvement in terror has been papered over and the burden has been put on both countries to exercise restraint and find a diplomatic solution."" Sibal further said, ""US claiming mediation has detracted from India's long held position against mediation. US is equating India and Pakistan. This has implications. Can US be trusted?""Shefali Vaidya, convenor of the Indic Academy with nearly 800,000 followers, tweeted Saturday. ""Don't understand the logic behind the sudden #ceasefire TBH, it feels like a bit anticlimactic to quit when you are clearly ahead, but I trust the leadership of my country to take the best decision under the circumstances.""After watching the Sunday DGMO briefing, though, she said, ""Seeing the DGMO press briefing live makes my heart filled with pride. This is how a professional force behaves, provide solid proof, speak in measured tones, unlike the over-the-top Pakistani army guys claiming victory!""Sadly, a 'dirty' online attack on foreign secretary Vikram Misri and his family also raged through Sunday.

Even those who do not support govt on many issues came out in support of Misri.Pollster Yashwant Deshmukh wrote on X, ""We all stand with #VikramMisri. Those who are trolling him, are simply Pakistani stooges living in India. If you are playing in enemy hands, you are a traitor hired by the enemy. That's the bottom line.

JAMMU: Security forces launched Sunday a cordon and search operation on the outskirts of Jammu after a brief gunfire exchange between a soldier and terrorists in Army fatigue near Nagrota Military Station the previous night.Sources said the exchange coincided with Pakistan’s drone attack and artillery shelling along the border, including Nagrota, late Saturday.“Searches resumed in the morning to trace the suspects and also to find the empty cartridges,” an official said. “Nothing substantial has been found so far.”This confrontation adds to a series of security alerts and terrorist sightings across Jammu region in recent weeks. On April 25, police and central forces launched a search in Kathua district after a local woman reported seeing four suspicious men.There have been some high-stakes pursuits in Kathua, Udhampur, Poonch, and Doda, but suspects continued evading capture by frequently shifting locations.","The exchange coincided with Pakistan’s drone attack and artillery shelling along the border, including Nagrota.

SRINAGAR: A pause in military action between India and Pakistan took hold Saturday evening along LoC in Kashmir’s Uri sub-division, following days of heavy Pakistani shelling, drone attacks, and cross-border firing. However, hundreds displaced from border villages remained in shelters as security forces cleared unexploded ordnance Sunday.J&K police urged evacuees not to return home, citing ongoing bomb disposal operations.Specialised teams are sweeping villages for unexploded shells, warning that remnants from attacks pose a serious threat.“These dangerous devices can remain active for extended periods and may detonate with minimal disturbance, posing extreme danger to untrained people,” police said in a public safety notice. “All citizens evacuated from frontline villages are advised to refrain from returning until official clearance is provided.”Operations are expected to take several days depending on weather and contamination levels. “Your safety remains our highest priority,” police added, stressing that unauthorised returns to restricted areas could lead to legal consequences.District authorities have set up temporary shelters with food, medical supplies, and essential aid. Around 15,000 people fled villages such as Salamabad, Razarwani, Gingal, Lagama, and Banday in Uri sub-division in north Kashmir’s Baramulla district. According to 2011 census, Uri’s population stands at 74,867.In Uri town, life began to stir Sunday morning. A few shops reopened and residents returned. By afternoon, authorities again instructed people to vacate. “I came early morning from Baramulla. I opened my restaurant and hoped the situation would stabilise. But in the afternoon, we were told to return,” said Abdul Rashid, a restaurant owner who spent the night back in Baramulla.Residents expressed cautious hope. “We are happy there is an agreement. We are hopeful we will return home soon,” said a Uri resident at a relief centre in Baramulla.Former CM and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti visited shelter homes Sunday, meeting displaced residents. “We don’t know how our family was saved,” said a woman from Salamabad. “We didn’t sleep a minute Thursday night and moved to Baramulla after shells landed in our village.”Mehbooba assured families she would urge govt to provide alternative housing and compensation. “War, bullets, and shelling have stolen homes and shattered childhoods,” she said. “In tin-roofed shelters, Kashmir’s children wait — not for revenge, but for peace.”","J&K police urged evacuees not to return home, citing ongoing bomb disposal operations.

Former India cricketer Venkatesh Prasad has made a scathing attack on Pakistan for ""violating"" the ceasefire agreement just hours after agreeing to end the military confrontation.The violation came despite a formal ceasefire agreement being jointly announced earlier in the day by both nations. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri confirmed that the Directors-General of Military Operations (DGMOs) from both sides had agreed to cease all hostilities — whether by land, air, or sea — with immediate effect.External Affairs Minister Dr S.Jaishankar also confirmed the ceasefire. “India and Pakistan have worked out an understanding on the stoppage of firing and military action,” he said. “India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations — and it will continue to do so.”However, in a stunning turnaround, explosions rocked Srinagar by the evening, prompting a red alert and widespread blackouts across Jammu & Kashmir. Simultaneously, Indian Air Defence forces intercepted and shot down Pakistani drones in Rajasthan’s Pokhran and Kashmir’s Baramulla, further escalating tensions.Taking to X, formerly known as Twitter, Prasad called out Pakistan's instability. He said: ""That country has three power centers- The Army, The ISI and the Prime Minister. It’s virtually impossible for all 3 to agree on a thing even if one of them does.""He further added that the last three days of the hostile tension were not enough and India should teach Pakistan a lesson.""The last three days weren’t enough, with this provocation, India will teach Pakistan a lesson of a lifetime.""Tensions between India and Pakistan have sharply escalated following the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22, which claimed the lives of 26 people, mostly tourists. In response to this brutal attack, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting and striking nine terrorist bases deep inside Pakistan.","Former India cricketer Venkatesh Prasad criticises Pakistan for 'violating' ceasefire agreement just hours after agreeing to end military confrontation.

PATNA: The semi-naked body of a woman was recovered from a rainwater harvesting pipe at the terminal building under construction at Jayprakash Narayan International Airport in Patna late on Saturday evening. The police have not yet determined the identity of the deceased, who is believed to be one of the construction workers in her mid-30s.According to the police, the body, which had injury marks, was discovered after some construction workers reported some noise coming out from the pipes on the second floor of the upcoming terminal building. Upon receiving the information, the manager started an investigation to identify the source of the noise. Engineers drilled small holes in all three pipes installed for rainwater harvesting, and inserted a camera, which found the body inside a 20-inch pipe.Airport police station SHO Manoj Kumar told this newspaper on Sunday that the engineers initially saw the woman's feet and alerted them. ""The police and a forensic team rushed to the spot, and recovered the body of the woman after cutting open the 20-inch pipe. Clothes on the upper part of the body was missing. The police found the clothes on the top of the terminal building, near the opening of the pipe,"" he said, adding the body was sent to IGIMS-Patna for a postmortem examination.Secretariat SDPO-I Anu Kumari, who had reached the spot with Patna superintendent of police (central) Sweety Shehrawat, said they were conducting investigation from all angles. ""The police are questioning the construction agencies to determine her identity,"" she said.Kumar said they couldn't get any CCTV camera footage as the cameras at the new terminal haven't been activated yet. ""Thousands of workers are engaged in the construction of the building, and it appears that the victim is one of them,"" the SHO said, adding the construction company has hired people from four-five different agencies. ""The police have questioned two agencies so far, besides some workers, but no one recognises her.

Poll Should Shiv Sena (UBT) have attended the first all-party meeting after the attack? Yes, it was crucial. No, their absence was acceptable.

(With inputs from PTI)





NEW DELHI: The Shiv Sena (UBT) is facing sharp criticism over Uddhav Thackeray ’s absence during the recent Pahalgam terror attack and his party’s decision to skip a key all-party meeting . Political observers and party insiders say the opposition party's image has suffered due to its lack of presence during a national crisis.According to party sources cited by news agency PTI, the Thackeray family has returned from their vacation.According to PTI, Uddhav Thackeray was last seen publicly on April 19, when he addressed members of the Bharatiya Kamgar Sena, the party's labour wing. His absence coincided with the April 22 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which claimed 26 lives.Criticism intensified after Maharashtra deputy chief minister and Shiv Sena leader Eknath Shinde took a jibe at Thackeray on Thursday, accusing him of vacationing in Europe while party workers were in distress.Shiv Sena MP Milind Deora was even more direct in his condemnation.""From sons of the soil to tourists of India'. How far the Thackerays have fallen. While bullets flew in #Pahalgam, they were vacationing in Europe,"" he posted on X.""Maharashtra needs warriors on duty, not part-time Netas on holiday,"" he added.In another post on May 9, two days after India carried out retaliatory strikes on terrorist camps following the Pahalgam attack, Deora tweeted again: ""Take UBT, for instance.Their hate for PM @narendramodi ji & DCM @mieknathshinde ji has turned into hate for India & Maharashtra.""A Shiv Sena (UBT) MLA acknowledged that while taking a personal break is not inherently wrong, the timing hurt public perception.""The family had gone on a vacation, and it would not be right to comment on it as it is a family matter. But yes, their long absence at such a time does not look good for the party,"" he said.A party functionary also confirmed Thackeray’s return, saying: ""We are not aware of the itinerary, but he (Thackeray) is now back in the country.""In contrast, Eknath Shinde visited Jammu and Kashmir after the attack to assist in the return of tourists from Maharashtra. His government also arranged special flights, and the deputy CM personally met families who lost loved ones in the attack.While Shiv Sena (UBT) also facilitated travel arrangements, it came under scrutiny for missing the first all-party meeting called after the incident.Party MP Arvind Sawant initially explained that he and Sanjay Raut had to skip the meeting due to their parliamentary committee commitments and travel schedules. Later, Raut claimed the party intentionally missed it as they would have demanded Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s resignation—potentially embarrassing opposition allies.Ahead of the second all-party meeting on May 7, after India’s Operation Sindoor, Raut said the party had skipped the earlier one due to a lack of concrete government action.The Shiv Sena (UBT) did attend the all-party meeting on May 7 following India’s retaliation.Political analyst Abhay Deshpande said Thackeray’s absence, particularly at such a critical moment, reflected poorly on the party. He noted that as a key member of the INDIA alliance, Shiv Sena (UBT) should have been present at the first all-party meet.Another political expert, Hemant Desai, said the undivided Shiv Sena had always maintained a proactive stance during national crises. He suggested Thackeray should have cut short his vacation.""When the Sena UBT attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi after the Pahalgam attack, what were its leaders doing?"" Desai asked, adding that the top leadership being away doesn't mean the whole party is on pause.Desai also pointed out that the response from Sena (UBT) lacked the intensity that the original Shiv Sena was known for.While Uddhav Thackeray did issue a statement after Operation Sindoor on May 7, he made no direct comment immediately following the Pahalgam attack. Aaditya Thackeray, however, tweeted about the attack, India’s response, and other related developments.Thackeray is expected to make a public appearance next week. According to Sanjay Raut, he will attend a book launch event on May 17, where NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) leader Sharad Pawar will also be present.","The Shiv Sena (UBT) is facing sharp criticism over Uddhav Thackeray’s absence during the recent Pahalgam terror attack.

Poll Do you believe the government should control media propaganda during times of conflict? Yes, it is essential. No, media should remain free.





MUMBAI: Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut on Friday asserted that the Centre must restrict propaganda being spread in the media amid escalation between India and Pakistan as both sides resort to continuous retaliation, posing a threat to civilian lives.He also criticised those celebrating war rather than extending support to the armed forces and those being ""martyred"" in the ongoing tensions.""The government should control the propaganda happening (in the media during such times). Otherwise, it will pull down the morale of our Army. The entire world is laughing at us. Even the retired army men are saying, 'What is happening?' However, some of them are going on TV and giving expert commentary like it is cricket.The standing of armed forces must be maintained since they are fighting, not us,"" Raut told reporters in a press conference here.Speaking about the war frenzy being created amid rising tensions, the Shiv Sena UBT MP suggested against celebrating war since people in border areas are constantly living under threat and are in danger.""We are not supporting them (the armed forces), but celebrating war. Let us tell the Army if they have attacked or not.Let the Defence Minister make a statement. I trust the official press notes. However, the environment (of war frenzy) being created generates fear among the public. Look at the conditions under which people in Jammu and Kashmir, Jaisalmer and Kutch are living. There's no fear for those living in Mumbai, Kolkata and Delhi. That's why we are doing this,"" Raut said.Raut further expressed his disappointment over people living in metropolitan cities celebrating war, saying that people, including children, have died in the Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir due to shelling by Pakistan.""15 people, including children, have died in Poonch. There's a blackout in Jammu and Kashmir. The civilians are in danger. Look at them facing war and then celebrate it. The majority of the country's population is facing war, and we are celebrating,"" he added.The Shiv Sena UBT leader stated that it was the responsibility and national duty of citizens and political parties to extend support to the government and armed forces since they remained on the battlefield against Pakistan.During the time of war, we should support the government and Indian armed forces because it is not we or the Prime Minister on the battlefield, but our armed forces.

RAIPUR: At least 13 persons, mostly women and children, were killed and half a dozen injured in a devastating road accident on the outskirts of Chhattisgarh capital late on Sunday.The deceased include nine women and a six-month-old infant. The collision occurred near Saragaon on the Raipur–Baloda Bazar highway near Kharora region. The accident took place when a goods vehicle carrying dozens of passengers collided with another vehicle.There was mayhem at the site as there were bodies scattered all over the road, many were in pieces while the injured cried for help.The injured people were rushed to BR Ambedkar hospital in Raipur for treatment.Raipur SSP Lal Umed Singh said the vehicle, loaded with 50 people, was returning from Chataud village from a “Chhathi” ceremony (a traditional postnatal ritual) held at Bana Banarsi village. They were traveling in a Swaraj Mazda goods vehicle (registration CG 04 MQ 1259), when a speeding trailer truck (JH-05 DP-7584) coming from the opposite direction rammed into them head-on near Saragaon.The impact was so powerful that multiple passengers died on the spot, and bodies were left mangled and scattered across the road.Most of the deceased were women and children. Witnesses described a grisly scene, with one elderly woman’s body severed into two, highlighting the sheer violence of the crash.The vehicle was reportedly carrying relatives of Puneet Sahu, whose daughter had recently given birth. They were returning after attending the baby’s naming and purification ceremony.Upon receiving word of the incident, local police and administrative officers rushed to the scene and launched rescue and relief operations. The injured were first taken to Kharora Community Health Center and then referred to Raipur Medical College due to the severity of their injuries. Many victims remain in critical condition, and officials warn that the death toll could rise.Police have begun an investigation into the incident and are questioning the driver of the trailer, who is suspected of speeding and possible negligence. Forensic teams have also been dispatched to the scene for further analysis.Raipur district collector Gaurav Singh said that it was an extremely unfortunate incident, and expressing deep sorrow over the tragedy, he assured all possible support to the families of the deceased and injured.Local political representatives and public officials visited the site and hospitals, calling the incident heart-breaking and unacceptable.Demands have been made for road safety audits and stricter traffic enforcement on the accident-prone Raipur–Baloda Bazar stretch.As grieving families await the final rites of their loved ones, the state reels from one of its deadliest road accidents in recent years.","The deceased include nine women and a six-month-old infant.

Israel's blockade means Gaza's hospitals cannot provide food to recovering patients,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israels-blockade-means-gazas-hospitals-cannot-provide-food-to-recovering-patients/articleshow/121092667.cms,"AP file photo





KHAN YOUNIS: Gaza Strip - It cost a fortune, she said, but Asmaa Fayez managed to buy a few zucchinis in a Gaza market. She cooked them with rice and brought it to her 4-year-old son, who has been in the hospital for the past week. The soup was his only meal of the day, and he asked for more.""It's all finished, darling,"" Fayez replied softly. Still, it was an improvement from the canned beans and tuna she brings on other days, she said.Hospital patients are among the most vulnerable as Palestinians across Gaza struggle to feed themselves, with Israel's blockade on food and other supplies entering the territory now in its third month.With hospitals unable to provide food, families must bring whatever they can find for loved ones.""Most, if not all, wounded patients have lost weight, especially in the past two months,"" Dr. Khaled Alserr, a general surgeon at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, told The Associated Press. Nutritional supplements for intensive care unit patients are lacking, he said.""Our hands are tied when it comes to making the best choice for patients. Choices are limited,"" he said.Hunger worsens as supplies dwindle Malnutrition is on the rise across Gaza, aid groups say.Thousands of children have been found with acute malnutrition in the past month, but adults as well are not getting proper nutrients, according to the U.N. It estimates that 16,000 pregnant women and new mothers this year face acute malnutrition.Since Israel's blockade began on March 2, food sources have been drying up. Aid groups have stopped food distribution. Bakeries have closed. Charity kitchens handing out bowls of pasta or lentils remain the last lifeline for most of the population, but they are rapidly closing for lack of supplies, the U.N. says.Markets are empty of almost everything but canned goods and small amounts of vegetables, and prices have been rising. Local production of vegetables has plummeted because Israeli forces have damaged 80% of Gaza's farmlands, the UN says, and much of the rest is inaccessible inside newly declared military zones.Fayez's son, Ali al-Dbary, was admitted to Nasser Hospital because of a blocked intestine, suffering from severe cramps and unable to use the bathroom. Fayez believes it's because he has been eating little but canned goods. She splurged on the zucchini, which now costs around $10 a kilogram (2.2 pounds). Before the war it was less than a dollar.Doctors said the hospital doesn't have a functioning scanner to diagnose her son and decide whether he needs surgery.Israel says it imposed the blockade and resumed its military campaign in March to pressure Hamas to release its remaining hostages and disarm.Hamas ignited the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage, most of whom have been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israel's offensive has killed over 52,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants.Concern over Israeli plans to control aid Israeli officials have asserted that enough food entered Gaza during a two-month ceasefire earlier this year. Rights groups have disputed that and called the blockade a ""starvation tactic"" and a potential war crime.Now Israeli plans to control aid distribution in Gaza , using private contractors to distribute supplies. The UN and aid groups have rejected the idea, saying it could restrict who is eligible to give and receive aid and could force large numbers of Palestinians to move, which would violate international law.Those under care at hospitals, and their families who scrounge to feed them, would face further challenges under Israel's proposal. Moving to reach aid could be out of the question.Another patient at Nasser Hospital, 19-year-old Asmaa Faraj, had shrapnel in her chest from an airstrike that hit close to her tent and a nearby charity kitchen in camps for displaced people outside Khan Younis.When the AP visited, the only food she had was a small bag of dates, a date cookie and some water bottles. Her sister brought her some pickles.""People used to bring fruits as a gift when they visited sick people in hospitals,"" said the sister, Salwa Faraj. ""Today, we have bottles of water.""She said her sister needs protein, fruits and vegetables but none are available.Mohammed al-Bursh managed to find a few cans of tuna and beans to bring for his 30-year-old son, Sobhi, who was wounded in an airstrike three months ago. Sobhi's left foot was amputated, and he has two shattered vertebrae in his neck.Al-Bursh gently gave his son spoonfuls of beans as he lay still in the hospital bed, a brace on his neck.""Everything is expensive,"" Sobhi al-Bursh said, gritting with pain that he says is constant. He said he limits what he eats to help save his father money.He believes that his body needs meat to heal.

BEIJING: China on Monday prepared to welcome Latin American leaders to Beijing for a major summit, seeking to draw the region closer in response to the trade war with the United States Beijing has stepped up economic and political cooperation with Latin American nations in recent years and urged a united front against US President Donald Trump's recent maelstrom of tariffs.Two-thirds of Latin American countries have joined Beijing's trillion-dollar Belt and Road (BRI) infrastructure programme, and China has surpassed the US as the biggest trading partner of Brazil, Peru and Chile, among others.The forum between China and the 33-member Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) is due to formally begin on Tuesday.Beijing has already begun welcoming regional leaders, notably Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who arrived in Beijing on Saturday for a five-day state visit.Lula has sought to improve ties with both China and the US since returning to power in early 2023. Brazilian exports to China reached more than $94 billion last year, according to the United Nations Comtrade Database.The South American agricultural power sends mainly soybeans and other primary commodities to China, while the Asian giant sells semiconductors, telephones, vehicles and medicines to Brazil.On Monday, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi hosted his Cuban counterpart Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla at Beijing's ornate Diaoyutai State Guesthouse for talks.Other expected attendees at the forum include Colombian President Gustavo Petro and Chilean President Gabriel Boric Petro said last week that he would sign a ""letter of intent"" to join the BRI when he meets Chinese President Xi Jinping in the coming days.Xi will address the summit at its opening ceremony on Tuesday, according to Beijing's foreign ministry.A senior ministry official said on Sunday that Beijing had ""always approached the development of China-Latin America relations from a strategic and long-term perspective"".""The people of Latin America and the Caribbean seek to build their own homeland -- not to serve as the backyard of any other country,"" Miao Deyu told a press conference.China was ""willing to strengthen communication and coordination with Latin American countries"" in the face of US tariffs, and ""jointly work to... oppose unilateralism and economic bullying"", Miao said.","Beijing has stepped up economic and political cooperation with Latin American nations.

DHAKA/NEW DELHI: Bangladesh 's deposed PM Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League on Sunday rejected ""with disgust"" the interim govt's decision to ban the party and vowed to continue its operations despite the restriction.The Muhammad Yunus-headed interim govt's council of advisers or the cabinet on Saturday night slapped a ban on ""all activities of Awami League"", including in cyberspace, under an anti-terrorism law. Reacting to the move, Awami League said, ""We are rejecting and protesting the fascist autocrat Yunus govt's decision with disgust... Awami League will carry on its activities in an appropriate course, defying the decision of the fascist Yunus govt."" The party expressed regret that ""independent Bangladesh"" had to witness the ban by an ""undemocratic fascist"" govt that runs the country ""without people's mandate"", while the country ""earned independence and sovereignty under Awami League's leadership"". ""We strongly believe people of Bangladesh will deliver a resounding response to this reckless decision by the Yunus regime.""Awami League also called upon all democratic states, institutions, and leaders around the world to denounce the move. Earlier, Yunus's press secretary Shafiqul Alam said the democratic world was unlikely to oppose the decision to ban ""the shameless, killer, anti-democracy, and corrupt party"". The move came after newly floated NCP rallied since Thursday and carried out blockades demanding the ban.","Bangladesh's deposed PM Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League on Sunday rejected ""with disgust"" the interim govt's decision to ban the party.

UK government to tighten immigration rules amid voter anger over 'failed experiment in open borders',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/uk-government-to-tighten-immigration-rules-amid-voter-anger-over-failed-experiment-in-open-borders/articleshow/121092591.cms,"UK PM Keir Starmer (AP)





LONDON: British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will on Monday unveil plans to tighten immigration rules, confronting an issue that has bedeviled successive governments and fuelled the rise of a new anti-immigrant party that could threaten the country's political establishment. Starmer, whose centre-left Labour Party won a landslide victory last July, is facing pressure from voters who are increasingly frustrated by high levels of immigration that many believe have strained public services and inflamed ethnic tensions in some parts of the country.Starmer is pledging to end what his office described as ""Britain's failed experiment in open borders,"" less than two weeks after Reform UK rode the immigration issue to victories in local elections.Labour and the center-right Conservatives, long the dominant parties in British politics, both saw their support crater in the contests for local government councils and mayors.""Every area of the immigration system, including work, family and study, will be tightened up so we have more control. Enforcement will be tougher than ever and migration numbers will fall,'' Starmer said in excerpts of a speech to be delivered on Monday.""We will create a system that is controlled, selective and fair.""Immigration has been a potent issue in Britain since 2004, when the European Union expanded to Eastern Europe. While most EU countries restricted immigration from the new member states for a period of years, the UK immediately opened its labor market, attracting a flood of new arrivals.By 2010, then-Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to cut annual net immigration to less than 1,00,000, a target four Conservative governments failed to meet. In 2016, anger over the government's inability to control immigration from the EU triggered a referendum in which Britain voted to leave the bloc.But Brexit did nothing to reduce the number of people entering the country on visas for work, education and family reunification.In recent years, concerns that the government has lost control of Britain's borders have been fuelled by the sight of thousands of migrants entering the U.K. illegally on leaky, inflatable boats operated by people smugglers. Some 37,000 people crossed the English Channel on small boats last year, down from 45,755 in 2022, government statistics show.Reform's performance in the local elections was ""because people are raging, furious, about the levels of both legal and illegal immigration,"" Deputy Party Leader Richard Tice told Sky News.Annual net migration, the number of people entering the UK minus those who left, stood at 7,28,000 in the year to June 2024. While that figure was down 20% from the year to June 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics, it was still more than seven times the target set by the Conservatives in 2010.Starmer's government doesn't plan to set a new target, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, who is in charge of immigration, said on Sunday.""We're not going to take that really failed approach, because I think what we need to do is rebuild credibility and trust in the whole system,"" she said in an interview with Sky News.Instead, she said, the government will focus on policies such as restricting visas for lower-skilled workers. The new rules will mean 50,000 fewer visas for these workers next year, Cooper said.Chris Philp, Cooper's Conservative counterpart, said his party will support such proposals but they don't go far enough.""Tomorrow we intend to push to a vote in Parliament a measure that would have an annual cap on migration voted for and set by Parliament to restore proper democratic accountability, because those numbers were far, far too high,"" he said.","UK PM Keir Starmer will unveil plans to tighten immigration rules on Monday.

QUITO: Five fishermen who spent 55 days adrift at sea arrived Saturday at a port in the Galapagos Islands after being rescued by a tuna boat, the Ecuadorian navy said on X.The three Peruvians and two Colombians had been missing since mid-March and were found on May 7 by an Ecuadorian boat called Aldo.The fishermen had reported damage to the boat's alternator two days after setting sail from Pucusana Bay, to the south of Peru's capital Lima, the navy said in a separate post on Friday.The failure caused communication and navigation tools to malfunction, Ecuadorian navy Frigate Capt. Maria Fares told The Associated Press, adding that they had no power on the boat.""They had no starter, lights and everything that a battery generates,"" she said.To survive, they had to ""take rusted water out of the engine (and) when a fish passed by, they caught it and parboiled it to eat."" Fares added that they also drank rain and sea water to survive.The men are in stable condition and the navy said it is coordinating with local and foreign authorities to ensure their safe return to their respective countries.Earlier this year, another Peruvian fisherman, 61-year-old Maximo Napa, spent 95 days at sea alone. He was also rescued by an Ecuadorian vessel and returned to Lima in mid-March to be reunited with his family.","Three Peruvians and two Colombians had been missing since mid-March and were found on May 7 by an Ecuadorian boat called Aldo.
