'Batenge Toh Katenge': Uddhav & Raj Thackeray Unite For Mumbai Civic Polls | Shiv Sena (UBT) | MNS

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray , who recently forged an alliance with his estranged cousin Uddhav Thackeray ahead of the BMC polls, warned Uttar Pradesh and Bihar migrants against the Hindi imposition.Thackeray said he would ""kick"" people from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh out of Maharashtra if they ""try to impose Hindi"".""People from UP and Bihar should understand that Hindi is not your language. I don't hate the language... But if you try to impose it, I'll kick you. They're coming from all sides to Maharashtra and snatching away your share... If land and language are gone, you will be finished,"" Raj Thackeray was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Calling the BMC polls the ""last election for the Marathi man"", Thackeray said: ""If you miss this opportunity today, you will be finished. Unite for Marathi and Maharashtra.""""Today, this crisis has arrived at your doorstep... This is the last election for the Marathi man... If you miss this opportunity today, you will be finished. Unite for Marathi and Maharashtra. Mumbai was obtained through the sacrifices of so many people... What will we tell them?... The BLA (Booth Level Agents) appointed at 6 AM should be ready on election day... Be alert, be vigilant, don't be careless...If anyone comes to vote again, throw them out,"" Thackeray said.



Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray and his cousin Raj Thackeray on Sunday mounted a joint attack on the rival BJP over what they described as “fake Hindutva” at a rally held ahead of the civic polls, saying their political reunion was prompted by an imminent “danger” to Mumbai.Uddhav said he and Raj Thackeray, who heads the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), had set aside their differences in the interest of the Marathi manoos, Hindus, and Maharashtra.Appealing to the core Marathi votebank, Raj said the two leaders had come together as Mumbai was facing danger.“This is the last election for Marathi manoos. If he makes a mistake now, the battle (for Mumbai) will be lost forever,” he said.Speaking after Raj, the Sena (UBT) chief questioned whether the BJP wanted to rename Mumbai as “Bombay”, referring to remarks made by Tamil Nadu BJP leader K Annamalai.Accusing the BJP of practising divisive politics ahead of elections, Uddhav said, “BJP's Hindutva and nationalism are fake.”“The BJP has become a party which says corruption first, instead of nation first,” he added.","MNS chief Raj Thackeray warns Uttar Pradesh and Bihar migrants against the Hindi imposition.

‘Hijab-Clad PM’ Row: Owaisi’s ‘Tubelight’ Jab At Himanta Sarma Over ‘Only Hindu PM’ Remarks

'Hindutva a political tract'

'Cherishing Hinduism is Hindutva'

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar stirred another row on Sunday after he said Hindutva is ""Hinduism in paranoia,"" which drew a strong response from the ruling BJP During the debate on ""Hinduism Needs Protection From Hindutva"", hosted by the Calcutta Debating Circle, Aiyar said Hindutva is a BJP leader ""slapping a blind, hungry tribal girl because she attends a Christmas lunch in a Church"".Aiyar also said Hindutva asks ""80 per cent of Hindus to quiver in front of 14 per cent of Muslims"".""Hindutva is Hinduism in paranoia. It asks 80% Hindus to quiver in front of 14% Muslims. Hindutva is a BJP leader slapping a blind, hungry tribal girl because she attends a Christmas lunch in a Church. Hindutva raids shopping malls to tear down Christmas decorations,"" said Aiyar during the debate.He also quoted VD Savarkar, saying that the Hindutva ideologue saw Buddhism as an existential threat to all Hindus.""He described it as the ultimate negation of Hindutva, bearing the opiate of universalism and nonviolence. He said it was disastrous to national virility and even the existence of the Hindu race,"" said Aiyar, referring to Savarkar.Drawing a distinction between Hinduism and Hindutva, Aiyar said Hinduism is ""a great spiritual religion, while Hindutva is a political tract."" He also said that Hinduism faced trials and tribulations yet managed to survive and flourish without any need for Hindutva's protection.""Hinduism is a great spiritual religion. Hindutva is a political tract. Hindutva came only in 1923; for thousands of years before Hindutva, Hinduism faced trial and tribulation and yet survived, flourished, with no need of Hindutva protection... There is no way Gandhi's and Swami Vivekananda's Hinduism can be protected or promoted by Savarkar's Hindutva,"" Aiyar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Speaking at the same event, Rajya Sabha member and BJP leader Sudhanshu Trivedi said that Hindutva represents 'Hindu tattva,' which forms the core essence of Hinduism.He further argued that Hinduism is unique among religions in granting its followers the authority to debate, even on its sacred texts.""... Which culture gives you the authority to debate even on religious texts. It is only Hindu... I would like to ask why the term Hinduism? Why is 'ism' associated with all the religions which originated in India? Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism. You have never heard of Islamism and Christianism... The 'ism' world is being associated just to demean, and what Hindutva is, 'Hindu tattva'. The basic immunity of Hinduism is Hindu tattva. .. Another thing I would like to say, when you cherish Hinduism, it is called Hindutva,"" the Trivedi said.Lashing out at Aiyar's remark, the BJP's national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari said: ""Yet again Congress attempts to create a divide between Hindus.""They want 1 Hindu to Stand up against the other Hindu. This benefits Congress whose only focus is -""Consolidate Vote Bank: Unite Minority, Divide Hindu Majority,"" he said.","Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar stirred another row on Sunday after he said Hindutva is ""Hinduism in paranoia"" The remark drew a strong response from the ruling BJP.

'Called Minor Matter, Refused FIR': Tripura Student Angel Chakma's Father Blasts Uttarakhand Police

'Oye Chinese '



Anjel Chakma

'I am an Indian'



'Do you even get Maggi there?'



Do you even get Maggi there? How do you survive with all the non-veg food? I also heard you people eat cats and dogs. A colleague asked Sushma, who hails from Assam

Fear during Covid



'My only mistake is that I look like this'



Nido Taniam

India has seen such cases for years



A legal vaccum



""You people eat dogs, cats, pigs and all your animals, right?"" This was a question Riba says she was repeatedly asked because she hails from the Northeast.Working at a high-profile firm did little to shield her from stereotypes. Friends, colleagues and acquaintances routinely questioned her food habits, appearance and even language.What hurt most, she says, was that many people did not see anything wrong with asking such questions.""It definitely triggered me being questioned every day about what I eat, how I look and where I belong,"" she recalls.That casual prejudice, civil rights activists say often escalates into something far more dangerous.These day-to-day casual slurs, which come as no surprise in the lives of people from the Northeast, reveal that even India’s so-called cosmopolitan ""melting pots"" often fail to be truly inclusive.For many from the region living outside it, these cities remain spaces where identities are questioned and belonging is never fully accepted.On December 9, what began as a routine visit to a local market in Dehradun ended in fatal violence.Twenty-four-year-old Anjel Chakma from Tripura lost his life.Anjel and his younger brother Michael had been planning a Chandrashila trek scheduled for December 22 and had even ordered new trekking shoes for the trip.The shoes arrived a day after the attack. They were never unpacked.According to Michael and other family members, the brothers were subjected to racial slurs — "" Chinki ,"" ""Chinese"" and ""Momo"" during a grocery run in the Selaqui area. One of the men allegedly sneered, ""Oye Chinese, have you come to buy pork?""Anjel objected to the abuse and asserted their identity. ""We are not Chinese… We are Indians. What certificate should we show to prove that?"" he allegedly said.What followed, according to family and friends, was brutal violence.""Soon after Anjel replied, they attacked him and his brother while hurling abuses,"" said a friend who stayed at the hospital through the two weeks that followed. ""Anjel suffered serious injuries to his neck and spine. Michael is also injured and remains in serious condition.""Dehradun senior superintendent of police Ajai Singh said the comments appeared to target the brothers’ appearance. Police said Anjel was struck with a knife and a metal kada, leaving him critically injured.The case drew national attention after Anjel’s father said his son was attacked despite clearly asserting that he was Indian.Similar incidents occur with alarming regularity.Arjun Rimo from Arunachal Pradesh recalls a recent incident in Delhi that left him shaken. ""On January 8, 2026, in Karol Bagh, New Delhi, while buying meat at a shop, I was mistreated,"" he told TOI.""As I chose to leave, I was subjected to racial abuse and called ‘Chinese’. I immediately objected and stated that I am an Indian.""He said a person associated with the shop attacked him first.""I reacted only in self-defence. I punched him, during which he sustained a facial injury. Soon after, two more individuals joined him, and the three of them assaulted me together.""As a crowd of 30 to 35 people gathered, Rimo said he became overwhelmed.""I could no longer protect myself. Fearing serious harm, I sought police assistance,"" he said, adding that he personally witnessed the accused being taken into police custody.""This episode,"" he said, ""highlights a broader, long-standing challenge faced by citizens from India’s North-Eastern region,"" who frequently encounter bias and unequal treatment when living or travelling outside their home states, particularly in metropolitan cities.For many, stepping outside the Northeast means confronting suspicion, stereotyping and casual prejudice — not as isolated incidents, but as an everyday reality.For Sushma Pegu, who works at a high-profile firm in Bengaluru, discrimination followed her into corporate spaces.She recalls being bullied, subjected to racial slurs, and questioned relentlessly about her food habits.""A colleague literally asked me, ‘Do you even get Maggi there? How do you survive with all the non-veg food? I also heard you people eat cats and dogs.’""""I took a stand,"" she said, adding that the colleague was eventually terminated.But the questioning, she said, often begins the moment she steps into a cab, with drivers routinely asking, ""Which country are you from?"" prompted solely by her appearance.Roshni recalls how racial prejudice intensified during the Covid-19 outbreak.""During my time at Lakshmibai College,"" she said, ""a group of students passed a remark about one of my friends, saying, ‘Mujhe toh isko dekh kar dar lag raha hai’ (I feel scared just looking at her).""She said the comment, though made casually, carried a deep sense of exclusion and fear.""I felt shocked, angry and deeply uncomfortable,"" she said.""It created a lasting sense of humiliation and helplessness.""In October 2025, a 27-year-old flight attendant from Meghalaya alleged that she was racially abused twice within an hour in Delhi; first in north Delhi's Kamla Nagar and later on the metro.Her Instagram video went viral after Union minister Kiren Rijiju reposted it.In the video, the woman said a group of men sitting on a scooter mocked her using racial slurs and laughed. Shaken, she walked into a nearby Tibetan eatery but found herself unable to eat.""I did not feel like eating anything. My brain could not process what had just happened,"" she said.""It breaks my heart,"" she added. ""My only mistake is that I am born in India and I look like this and I don’t look like what people expect Indians to look like.""Having travelled to several countries, she said she had never been made to feel unwelcome abroad.""But today, in my own country, my fellow Indians made me feel like I did not belong.""Addressing the alleged perpetrators, she said, ""You didn’t just insult me. You insulted every person who has ever felt ‘othered’ in their own country. India is diverse our faces, our languages and our cultures are all valid. You don’t get to decide who belongs and who doesn’t.""Such incidents are far from isolated.In November 2023, students from the Northeast reported racial and misogynistic abuse near Delhi University’s North Campus. In 2016, two youths from Mizoram were beaten in Bengaluru for not speaking the local language.One of the most chilling cases remains the killing of Nido Taniam in January 2014. The 19-year-old student from Arunachal Pradesh was beaten to death in Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar after shopkeepers mocked his hairstyle.A police investigation report detailed how Nido and his friends had gone to meet another friend when a shopkeeper made derogatory remarks about his appearance.An altercation followed, during which Nido smashed a glass pane. The shopkeeper and his associates allegedly assaulted him while making racist remarks about his caste, race and appearance.Although the immediate dispute was settled after Nido paid compensation, he was later assaulted again by the group and died in his sleep at a friend’s residence.The incident sparked widespread outrage among people from the Northeast living in Delhi, with allegations that the police failed to protect him despite repeated pleas.India is a signatory to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, yet does not have a specific law addressing racial discrimination.Following Nido Taniam’s death, the MP Bezbaruah Committee recommended criminalising racial slurs such as ""chinki"" and ""Chinese"", proposing jail terms of up to five years.While some administrative steps were taken, the proposed amendments to the IPC remain pending.In 2016, the Supreme Court directed the Centre to monitor the implementation of the committee’s recommendations. Activists, however, say enforcement remains inconsistent, with racial abuse often dismissed as a social issue rather than treated as a criminal offence.These incidents show how deeply racial prejudice is woven into everyday life. While stronger laws are necessary, activists argue they are not sufficient on their own.The fight, they say, must begin in schools, through education on diversity, history and discrimination. It must be carried forward by police, institutions, political parties and society at large.Multiculturalism cannot remain a slogan. It must be practised.","Civil rights activists say casual prejudice often escalates into something far more dangerous. Even India's so-called cosmopolitan ""melting pots"" often fail to be truly inclusive. For many from the region living outside it, these cities remain spaces where identities are questioned and belonging is never fully accepted.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126465493,imgsize-68780,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Massive search operation on near IB in Kanachak sector of Jammu

JAMMU: Security forces picked up movement of suspected drones in several forward areas along the International Border (IB) and Line of Control (LoC) in Samba, Rajouri and Poonch districts of J&K on Sunday evening, officials said. All flying objects came from the Pakistan side, and returned after hovering over Indian territory for a few minutes, they said.According to officials, security forces have launched a search operation on the ground after noticing the suspected drone activity in the forward areas.In a related development, security forces launched a massive search operation after intel agencies detected satellite communication by suspected terrorists near the IB in Rajpura area of Jammu's Kanachak sector Sunday.Army troops guarding the Nowshera sector along the LoC in Rajouri, fired from medium and light machine guns on observing drone movement over GaniaKalsian village around 6.35 pm, officials said. Another drone was noticed at Khabbar village in Teryath in Rajouri district at 6.35 pm.The flying object, with blinking light, came from the direction of Dharmsal village in Kalakote and moved further towards Bharakh, officials said.A drone-like object with blinking light was also seen hovering for several minutes over Chak Babral village in Ramgarh sector of Samba around 7.15 pm, they said. Another drone-like object was seen moving from the direction of Tain towards Topa in Mankote sector, located along the LoC, in Poonch district at 6.25 pm.Earlier on Friday night, security forces recovered an arms consignment, allegedly dropped by a drone that originated in Pakistan, in Paloora village of Ghagwal near the IB in Samba district. The recovery included two pistols, three magazines, 16 rounds and a grenade, they added. In another development, security forces launched a massive search operation after intelligence agencies detected satellite communication by suspected terrorists near the IB in Jammu’s Kanachak sector on Sunday.The communication was traced to a Thuraya satellite device around 3pm, and its GPS location was tracked, said officials. “Soon after, a joint team of the Army, J&K Police’s SOG, BSF , and CRPF , cordoned off the area and launched a search operation,” an official said. While nothing suspicious had been discovered so far, further combing was under way, officials said. The SSP Poonch chaired a meeting with Village Defence Group members from the border village of Jhullas on Sunday, and directed the volunteers to remain alert and committed to protecting their villages while strictly sticking toSOPs.","Security forces picked up movement of suspected drones in several forward areas along the International Border (IB) and Line of Control (LoC) in Samba, Rajouri and Poonch districts of J&K.

Amit Shah Confident BJP Will Form Government In Kerala In 2026, Vote Share Climbing

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Union home minister Amit Shah demanded Sunday Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan 's resignation and warned of statewide BJP protests unless a ""neutral probe"" is ordered into an alleged gold heist linked to Sabarimala hill shrine.""It is time for CM Pinarayi Vijayan to go, as LDF could not safeguard Sabarimala and also could not bring development to the state,"" Shah said, addressing party workers at a felicitation function for BJP winners in local body polls in Thiruvananthapuram. He said the FIR in the case was ""designed to protect the real culprits"" and questioned how justice could be ensured ""when ministers are involved"".The alleged gold heist linked to Sabarimala in Pathanamthitta district has triggered political accusations, with BJP claiming a cover-up and seeking a probe independent of Kerala police. Left Democratic Front (LDF) govt denies wrongdoing. According to the state-appointed SIT, gold embedded in sacred structures was allegedly stripped, diverted and converted in 2015 through a planned operation involving temple officials, intermediaries and private jewellers.Setting the tone for BJP's campaign ahead of the 2026 Kerala assembly elections, Shah predicted a breakthrough. ""The lotus will bloom in the state as BJP will assume office in 2026,"" he said.""Our aim is to develop Kerala, to protect the state from anti-nationals, and safeguard the centuries-old devotion of the people.""He accused both LDF and Congress-led opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) of ""match-fixing"" that led to stagnation. ""Communist parties are wiped out from the entire world and Congress has been wiped out in India. The path to development of Kerala is with NDA under the leadership of Modi-ji,"" Shah said, linking Kerala's future to PM Narendra Modi's goal of a developed India by 2047.Citing BJP's growth, Shah said vote share rose from 16% in 2019 to 20% in 2024 and claimed the jump to ""30% to 40%"" would come in 2026. ""I am confident that BJP state president Rajiv Chandrasekhar can end this musical chair by LDF and UDF,"" he said.Drawing parallels with other states, Shah listed BJP's rise from marginal presence to govt in Assam, Manipur, Tripura, and UP. ""Today we have a mayor in Thiruvananthapuram, and tomorrow we will see a CM,"" he said.","Union home minister Amit Shah demands resignation of Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan.

Congress’s in-charge for Tamil Nadu Girish Chodankar had asked if any political party “will say that they don't want the power; then we should name ourselves as NGO.”Periyasamy’s remarks assert DMK’s long-held position on governance in the state. Since 1967, both the DMK and the AIADMK have formed governments on their own despite contesting elections as part of alliances.The only exception dates back to the first assembly (1952–57) in the then Madras state, when the Congress, lacking an absolute majority, accommodated non-Congress leaders in its Cabinet.In 2006, the DMK ran a full five-year government despite falling short of a majority, relying on outside support from allies, including the Congress, but without sharing ministerial power. Congress leaders had made similar demands during that term as well, without success.","Senior DMK leader and rural development minister I Periyasamy ruled out any scope for a coalition government in Tamil Nadu.

Even within TN Cong, some do not press for a coalition government

With inputs from agencies

DINDIGUL: Tamil Nadu's governing DMK has rejected demands from a section of ally Congress's state unit for a share in power after this summer's assembly polls, with minister I Periyasamy asserting on Sunday that there ""would be no coalition govt here"".Speaking in Dindigul, Periyasamy pointed out that Tamil Nadu had always been governed by a single party and the tradition would continue even after the ensuing elections. This is the first time DMK has formally rejected the demand, which has gained traction over the past several months.Periyasamy, DMK deputy general secretary and rural administration minister, admitted that Congress was within its rights to put forth the demand but made it clear that CM M K Stalin wasn't inclined to accept. ""Tamil Nadu has always had single-party rule. The CM is firm on this,"" Periyasamy said.The remarks come amid the chorus for powersharing growing louder. Sections of Congress, including MP Manickam Tagore, have stressed that no party can win elections on their own in Tamil Nadu and the time has come for a discussion on coalition govts. Tagore had said the debate was no longer just about winning power but also about sharing it.Although DMK has credited its alliance for its successive electoral victories, the party has consistently resisted power-sharing demands. DMK’s other allies, too, are divided on the issue — unlike Congress, VCK, Left parties and MDMK do not insist on coalition govts. Even within Congress, there are voices, including that of state chief K Selvaperunthagai, who do not press for the demand. However, AICC incharge for Tamil Nadu, Girish Chodankar, has pushed for coalitions, suggesting political parties should call themselves “NGOs” if they declare they don’t want power.","DMK rejects demands from a section of ally Congress's state unit for a share in power after this summer's assembly polls.

Different words. The same grim picture.



The never-ending list of restrictions



‘Staying within limits’ does not protect women



Shifting the focus: From victims to perpetrators



The way forward

“Only when Sitaji crossed the Lakshman rekha was she kidnapped by Ravan ,” BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya said in 2013, invoking the mythological boundary as a warning for women to stay “within limits” to avoid being abducted by “Ravanas”.The remark was widely criticised at the time. Yet its underlying message was unmistakable: when violence occurs, the woman must have stepped out of line.Statements like these reflect a long-standing pattern in which responsibility quietly shifts from the perpetrator to the victim — from the act of violence itself to a woman’s choices, movements and behaviour.This is not about one leader, one party or one careless remark. It is about a mindset — deeply embedded across politics, courts, families and everyday conversations — that continues to search for causes of sexual violence in women’s conduct rather than men’s decisions.Back in 2013, Vijayvargiya’s comments were condemned. More than a decade later, the language may have softened, the metaphors may have changed — the thinking has not.Fast forward to 2025, and similar blame once again dominated headlines.Last October, a second-year medical student was gang-raped near her institute campus in Durgapur after stepping out for dinner with a male classmate. In response, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said that “girls should not be allowed to come outside at night-time.”The remark drew political backlash. BJP MP Bansuri Swaraj accused Banerjee of justifying rape and called the comment reflective of a “regressive mindset.” Banerjee later said her words had been distorted and taken out of context.But once again, the focus had shifted — away from the crime, toward policing women’s behaviour.Victim-blaming is not confined to political rhetoric. At times, it seeps into judicial language as well.In March 2025, the Allahabad High Court granted bail to a man accused of raping a woman he met at a bar in Delhi’s Hauz Khas, observing that the “victim herself invited trouble.”The comment drew sharp scrutiny from the Supreme Court. Justices B.R. Gavai and Augustine George Masih cautioned judges against such observations, stating that while bail may be granted, courts must be careful in how they speak about survivors of sexual violence.In 2021, Karnataka MLA KR Ramesh Kumar sparked nationwide condemnation after saying in the assembly that “when rape is inevitable, lie down and enjoy it” — a statement that drew laughter from some members.The remark was later withdrawn, with Kumar apologising and claiming he had no intention of insulting women or the House. But the damage lay not just in the words, but in the ease with which they were spoken and received.Time and again, public discourse around sexual violence drifts away from the crime itself and toward moral instruction for women — where they should go, how they should dress, and when they should be visible.From warnings like “don’t cross limits” to strict rules such as “don’t step out at night,” the underlying message remains the same — women must continue to change and modify their lives to prevent crimes they did not commit. For many, these limitations are not a matter of choice but an evil necessity, adopted as precautions to stay safe and protected.For many families, these restrictions are framed as protection, not control. The mother of a 19-year-old told TOI that while she had no issue with her daughter’s clothes or independence, that freedom felt conditional.“When we’re around, we feel she is safe,” she said. “But when she’s alone, it’s different.”Another woman from Noida described the same conflict. “I want my daughter to live freely,” she said. “But with crime rates so high, fear always wins.”However, no matter what measures women take, it is never really safe.A 21-year-old college student told TOI about a frightening experience returning late to her college hostel. “A car with 4-5 men slowed down near me, and one called out, ‘ee aaja’ (hey, come here). My instincts said to run, but I felt numb and just kept walking. They eventually drove off, but those few seconds traumatised me,” she said, adding that she was dressed modest.A Delhi-based corporate worker told TOI, “Though my parents are supportive and trust me, they still set what they think are ‘reasonable’ restrictions for my safety—like a curfew and discomfort with certain clothes since I use public transport here. Given the city’s crime rates, they believe dressing modestly and getting home before dark helps avoid unwanted attention. It’s as if it’s normal for women not to go out at night—that’s the reality. ”This is the quiet burden women grow up carrying — not just fear of violence, but fear of blame.The idea that safety lies in restraint collapses under data.According to NCRB figures from 2023, 97.5% of reported rape cases were committed by someone known to the victim. Homes, families and relationships — not streets alone — are often where violence occurs.Supreme Court advocate Barnali Basak told TOI that social stigma prevents many survivors, particularly from privileged backgrounds, from reporting sexual violence.“The fear of social judgment outweighs the crime itself,” she said.Children remain among the most vulnerable. Experts warn that abuse within families often goes unreported for years, silenced by fear, dependency and shame.Akansha Rastogi, a developmental psychologist at Children First, told TOI, “When a child reports abuse but is ignored or silenced, the psychological impact can be severe. Their boundaries are violated, and they lose their sense of control. This can lead to long-term mental health issues, insecurities, and difficulties trusting others.” She further added that trauma is often stored in the body, as it keeps“the score, which can affect future relationships and intimacy in unpredictable ways. ”Dr Medha, assistant professor of psychology at Patna Women’s College, explained that victim-blaming functions as a psychological defence.She explained, “Victim-blaming helps people feel safe. It reduces fear, protects social beliefs, and maintains existing power structures.”“People want to believe the world is fair,” she said. “Blaming the victim creates distance — ‘this won’t happen to me.’”But the reality, experts stress, is simple: rape is not caused by clothing, behaviour or timing. It is an act rooted in power, entitlement and control. “Rape is not caused by a woman’s clothes, behavior, or personality…rape occurs even when women are: fully covered, elderly, children, disabled, or in safe places. These cases clearly show that clothing or “attractiveness” is not the cause,” Dr Medha explained.Women are raped at home, by relatives, by husbands, in daylight, while fully covered, and even as children. If clothing or visibility were causes, these patterns would not exist.The conclusion is unambiguous: rape happens because some men choose to violate.Blaming women does nothing to prevent it. Holding perpetrators accountable does.Ending victim-blaming requires a fundamental shift — from asking “Why was she there?” to asking “Why did he do this?”Blaming the victim can create a false sense of security: “If I don’t do that, it won’t happen to me.” But this is an illusion. Sexual violence occurs not because someone was visible, friendly, or outside—it happens because someone felt entitled, lacked empathy, or chose to misuse power.According to trauma psychologist Judith Herman, healing begins when survivors are believed, not interrogated.“Blaming women is fear-based,” she writes. “Believing women is justice-based.”A society that stops blaming survivors is not becoming weaker. It is becoming more honest.","A long-standing pattern in which responsibility quietly shifts from the perpetrator to the victim.

Rare visits do not amount to shared conjugal life: HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rare-visits-do-not-amount-to-shared-conjugal-life-hc/articleshow/126472115.cms,".

KOLKATA: ""Once in a blue moon"" visits do not amount to a shared conjugal life, Calcutta high court said on Jan 8 while granting divorce to a couple living apart since 2015, ruling that a marriage stripped of empathy cannot be sustained. The court dissolved the marriage but allowed the father monthly access to his son.A division bench of Justices Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya and Supratim Bhattacharya held that irretrievable breakdown of marriage qualifies as cruelty under Special Marriage Act, extending a 2023 Supreme Court ruling under Hindu marriage law to cases governed by the 1954 statute.The wife, a medical professional posted in Kurseong in north Bengal's Darjeeling district, approached the HC after a lower court in 2022 refused divorce on grounds of cruelty and desertion. The couple married in 2007, lived in Howrah and had a son in 2011. Her earlier postings were in Malda and Birbhum, both in south-central Bengal, before she returned to Howrah and later moved to Kurseong.She argued they had been living separately since 2015, with only occasional visits by the husband and no marital relationship. She also complained the trial court had blocked testimony from her colleagues about alleged abuse at her workplace, even refusing video-conference evidence on grounds of ""insufficient infrastructure"".The HC disagreed, finding cruelty and desertion proved. It said the husband admitted living separately except for stray visits and failed to back claims of brief cohabitation. It also faulted rejection of video evidence on flimsy grounds.Judges pointed to contradictions in the husband's stand - opposing divorce while seeking continued access only to the child. ""When the convivial atmosphere is lost in a matrimonial relationship and all empathy dries up, nothing remains in the marriage for it to be sustained,"" the court said, declaring the marriage irretrievably broken.The husband may meet the child once a month, on the first Sunday, for two hours at a public place.","Calcutta high court grants divorce to a couple living apart since 2015.

NEW DELHI: Indian military retaliation against the terror attack in Pahalgam led Pakistan to frantically seek US mediation to make New Delhi pause the strikes deep inside its territory.Disclosures from US FARA (Foreign Agents Registration Act) filings reveal that between May 7, when IAF struck headquarters of JeM, LeT and Hizbul Mujahideen, and May 10, when Pakistan director general of military operations Major General Kashif Abdullah rang up his Indian counterpart Lt General Rajiv Ghai, Islamabad had launched an urgent lobbying campaign in Washington. Pakistani diplomats, including its ambassador and defence attache, initiated over 60 points of contact - comprising meetings, calls and emails - with high-ranking US officials and media outlets to solicit international intervention. The details are part of the filings by Squire Patton Boggs, hired by Pakistan for lobbying and which, like other US lobbying firms, are mandated to share with the US Department of Justice, the details and nature of their dealings.A majority of meetings were sought between the onset of Operation Sindoor and the eventual suspension of India's military operations with requests to secure American mediation to ""somehow halt"" India's retaliatory military operations.While Pakistan tried to dismiss the impact of India's strikes, the records confirm a high-level of behind-the-scenes panic.Pakistan had hired lobbying firm Squire Patton Boggs originally to help it steer away from FATF grey list. An email from its representative and former US ambassador Paul W Jones to US diplomat Elizabeth K Horst on May 14, 2025, sought a meeting with Eric (Garcetti, US ambassador to India) to ""discuss and hear his perspectives to move the relationship forward"".The email read: ""Squire Patton Boggs is a registered agent of the govt of Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh's interim government on Thursday announced that it has asked its key diplomatic missions in India, including the High Commission in New Delhi, to temporarily suspend visa services citing ""security concerns"".""What I have done is that I have asked our three missions (in India) to keep their visa sections closed for the time being. It's a security issue,"" Foreign affairs adviser M Touhid Hossain told reporters at a media briefing.The remarks came after Bangladesh's Deputy High Commission in Kolkata overnight restricted visa services, following similar steps taken earlier in New Delhi and Agartala.However, business and work visas have been kept outside the scope of the restrictions. Bangladesh also has diplomatic missions in Mumbai and Chennai, where visa services continue to operate normally.Hossain also said Bangladesh has approached the United States seeking a reversal of a recently imposed visa bond requirement. Dhaka will pursue diplomatic channels to seek an exemption, calling the move ""certainly unfortunate and painful for us,"" PTI reported.At the same time, he noted that the US decision was ""not abnormal"", as it was not applied only to Bangladesh and several other countries were facing similar immigration-related measures.Ties between Dhaka and New Delhi have remained strained since the Awami League government led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in violent, student-led protests in July–August 2024.Relations have since hit another roadblock following the killing of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi in Dhaka, which triggered anti-India protests. Hadi, a prominent figure in last year's July uprising, was killed amid rising political tensions, sparking widespread unrest.Protests also broke out after the killing of Dipu Chandra Das, a young Hindu factory worker who was lynched in Mymensingh after being falsely accused of religious defamation.Hindu religious organisations and minority rights groups held a protest outside the National Press Club in Dhaka on Monday, describing the incident as part of a wider pattern of religious extremism, attacks on minorities and official inaction.India too raised concerns over the safety of minorities, the security of diplomatic missions and what it calls ""misleading narratives"" emerging from Bangladesh. New Delhi further urged Dhaka to bring those responsible for the lynching of Dipu Chandra Das to justice and said it remained ""vigilant about the safety of minorities.""From exile in India, Sheikh Hasina blamed interim chief adviser Muhammad Yunus for Bangladesh's instability, accusing the interim government of empowering extremists, failing to protect minorities and undermining ties with India.","Bangladesh has asked its key diplomatic missions in India to temporarily suspend visa services.

BENGALURU: What was first believed to be a tragic death in a house fire has now been uncovered as a brutal murder.A second-year pre-university student has been arrested for the killing of a 34-year-old software engineer in east Bengaluru earlier this month. Police said the accused allegedly smothered the woman after she resisted his advances and then set fire to her flat in a calculated attempt to erase evidence.The victim, Sharmila Kushalappa, a native of Mangaluru, worked with Accenture and lived alone in a rented flat in Subramanya Layout, Ramamurthynagar. On the night of Jan 3, she was found unconscious inside her locked two-bedroom apartment after a fire broke out. She was later declared dead, with initial suspicion pointing to smoke inhalation — a theory that investigators would soon prove wrong.The accused, Karnal Kurai K, a IInd-year PU student at a private college and from Arasunagar in Virajpet town of Kodagu district, lived with his mother in the same building, next door to Sharmila's flat on the second floor. He has been arrested and remanded to three days of police custody.According to police, the case took a decisive turn after forensic and postmortem findings contradicted the initial assumption that Sharmila had died due to smoke inhalation. Ramamurthynagar police had received a complaint from Sharmila's friend, K Rohit, who suspected foul play after learning of her death.On the night of the incident, at 10.30pm, the building owner alerted the fire department after noticing smoke coming from Sharmila's flat. Fire personnel broke open the locked door and doused the flames. Sharmila was found lying motionless near the kitchen and was rushed to hospital, where doctors declared her brought dead.Investigators said injuries on her hands and visible signs of a struggle at the scene raised doubts. During autopsy, doctors found that the injuries were inflicted prior to the fire and were inconsistent with accidental burns. Medical opinion indicated that Sharmila had been smothered just before she lost consciousness.Based on this, police narrowed their probe and detained Karnal for questioning. He reportedly confessed to the crime. A police officer said Karnal entered Sharmila's flat through a sliding window at 9pm. When confronted, he expressed his desire towards her, which she resisted, shouting at him to leave. Enraged by the rejection, he allegedly held her mouth and nose shut, causing her to lose consciousness.Police said bloodstains from her mouth and nose were found on her clothes. To destroy this evidence, the accused allegedly removed the clothes and set them on fire before escaping through the same window. The fire later spread to other parts of the flat.","Karnal Kurai K, a second-year pre-university student has been arrested for the killing of a 34-year-old software engineer in east Bengaluru.

Call for strikes and street mobilisation

Message to protesters and security forces

Who is Reza Pahlavi?

Protests grip Iran





Iran’s former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi on Saturday said that he is preparing to return home. He linked the possible move to the ongoing mass protests against the country’s clerical leadership.Pahlavi, who has lived in exile in the United States for five decades, announced the move in a video message and a post on X, as demonstrations continued across Tehran and other cities.“I, too, am preparing to return to the homeland so that at the time of our national revolution’s victory, I can be beside you, the great nation of Iran. I believe that day is very near,” he wrote.His remarks came amid widespread unrest that has disrupted daily life in parts of Iran and posed one of the most serious challenges to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in years.Many demonstrators have openly called for the return of Pahlavi, the son of Iran’s last shah, who was overthrown during the 1979 Islamic Revolution.In his message, Pahlavi urged Iranians to intensify pressure on the state by targeting the economy and reclaiming public spaces. He called on workers in key sectors to stop work and join the protests.“I call upon the workers and employees of key economic sectors—especially transportation, oil, gas, and energy—to begin the process of nationwide strikes,” he said.Also Read: 1 USD = 1,400,000 IRR: Iran on edge - why this is the most dangerous uprising yet He also appealed for coordinated street action over the weekend, asking people to gather from 6 pm with national symbols and move towards the central areas of cities.“Our goal is no longer merely to be present in the streets; the goal is to prepare for the capture and holding of city centres,” Pahlavi said.Pahlavi praised those who have continued to demonstrate despite threats and crackdowns, describing recent protests as a major blow to the leadership.“My dear compatriots, through your courage and resilience, you have earned the admiration of the world,” he said. Pahlavi added that the protests were “a crushing response to the threats of the treacherous and criminal leader of the Islamic Republic.”He also addressed members of Iran’s armed and security forces who have expressed sympathy with protesters.“To the youth of Iran's Immortal Guard, and all armed and security forces who have joined the national cooperation platform, I say: Slow down and disrupt the repression machine even more so that on the appointed day, we can completely disable it,” he said.Reza Pahlavi was groomed from birth to inherit Iran’s Peacock Throne and was undergoing fighter pilot training in the United States when the 1979 revolution ended his father Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi’s rule.Forced into exile, he has since lived mainly in the US, becoming a symbolic figure for monarchists and some opposition groups, according to BBC.Now 65, Pahlavi said he does not seek to restore the monarchy by force, insisting instead on a peaceful transition and a national referendum to decide Iran’s future system of governance.“This is not about restoring the past. It’s about securing a democratic future for all Iranians,” he has said previously.Iran has been witnessing widespread protests for nearly two weeks, initially triggered by rising living costs but rapidly expanding into broader demonstrations against the clerical establishment.Large crowds have taken to the streets in Tehran and several other cities, chanting slogans against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Several human rights groups said that dozens of protesters have been killed and hundreds injured in clashes with security forces.Authorities have responded with a sweeping internet shutdown, which activists say is aimed at limiting the spread of protest footage and masking the scale of the crackdown.The unrest has drawn international attention, with Iran accusing the United States and Israel of inciting instability. Tehran has approached the United Nations Security Council, blaming foreign interference for the escalation of protests into violent acts.",Iran's former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi says he is preparing to return home.

Man found with 100 human skulls and mummfied bodies in Pennsylvania grave robbery case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/man-found-with-100-human-skulls-and-mummfied-bodies-in-pennsylvania-grave-robbery-case/articleshow/126457952.cms,"Deadly Blast Rocks Pennsylvania; Nursing Home Destroyed As Explosion Causes Multiple Casualties





A man accused of breaking into a historic cemetery near Philadelphia was found with about 100 human skulls, mummified body parts and decomposing torsos, after investigators linked him to a series of grave robberies stretching back weeks, authorities said. The suspect, Jonathan Christ Gerlach, 34, was arrested near Mount Moriah Cemetery, an abandoned burial ground on the city’s outskirts, where at least 26 mausoleums and underground vaults have been forced open since early November.The case came to a head when officers noticed bones and skulls visible inside a vehicle parked near the cemetery, prompting further investigation. Searches of Gerlach’s home in Ephrata and a storage unit uncovered more than 100 human skulls, long bones, mummified hands and feet, and two decomposing torsos, most of them stored in a basement, according to prosecutors.Delaware County District Attorney Tanner Rouse said the remains were in varying conditions. Some were intact, others partially assembled, and some consisted only of skulls placed on shelves. Jewellery believed to have been taken from graves was also recovered, and in at least one instance, a pacemaker was still attached, indicating that not all of the burials were extremely old.Investigators said Gerlach became a suspect after licence-plate data showed his vehicle had repeatedly been near the cemetery during the period of the break-ins.He was arrested as he returned to his car carrying a crowbar and a burlap bag, which authorities say contained mummified remains of two small children, three skulls and additional bones.According to police, Gerlach told investigators he had taken about 30 sets of human remains and showed them some of the graves he allegedly targeted. Authorities said the total number of remains recovered is still being assessed and could be higher.Founded in 1855, Mount Moriah Cemetery spans roughly 160 acres and is believed to contain around 150,000 graves, making it one of the largest abandoned burial grounds in the country. Police say the suspect focused on sealed vaults and mausoleums, damaging stonework to access remains inside.Prosecutors said the motive remains unclear, and they have declined to speculate while the investigation continues. “Given the scale of what we are dealing with, it is difficult at this stage to say exactly why this happened,” Rouse said.Gerlach has been charged with 100 counts each of abuse of a corpse and receiving stolen property, along with multiple counts of burglary, theft, trespassing, and desecration of a historic burial place and venerated objects. He is being held on $1 million bond. Court records do not list an attorney representing him.Authorities said identifying the remains and returning them to their original burial sites is expected to be a lengthy process, given the number involved and the age of many of the graves.","Jonathan Christ Gerlach, 34, was arrested near Mount Moriah Cemetery in Philadelphia.

Naughty But Nice

Barron Watches as Melania and Trump Share an ‘Uncomfortable’ New Year’s Kiss at Mar-a-Lago

CNN 20100429 010000 Larry King Live 4-year old Barron Trump speaks with Slovenian accent





Barron Trump has spent most of his life being watched without ever really being heard. Now 19 and a sophomore at New York University, the youngest son of President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump is, according to people close to the family, quietly working on how he sounds when he speaks.Celebrity journalist Rob Shuter reports that Barron has been taking elocution lessons, training focused on pronunciation and speech clarity, as part of an effort to soften the Slovenian-influenced accent he grew up with. In the Wednesday, January 7 edition of, a source close to the family said the teenager is “very focused on how he presents himself,” adding that he wants to “be confident when he speaks.”Barron’s accent has long been a quiet footnote of his childhood. Raised largely by his mother and her family, he grew up speaking multiple languages and sounded, at times, more European than American. That was on public display when he was four years old and appeared in a pre-recorded segment on Larry King Live. In the clip, a young Barron tells the host, “I like my suitcase,” speaking with a pronounced Slovenian accent. Asked by Larry King whether Barron had an accent, Melania replied, “He does,” explaining that he spent most of his time with her and spoke three languages.When King turned to Trump, the then-businessman answered simply: “I think it’s great. Anything he does is OK with me.”Those early clips resurfaced repeatedly as Barron grew older, including footage of him speaking with a pronounced Slovenian lilt, a reminder of how closely his upbringing was tied to his mother and grandparents. One family friend told Shuter that dynamic has not changed much with age. “Barron was raised primarily by his mother and his grandparents. Even as he grows older, Melania watches over him closely. She wants him to have a normal life, free from cameras and public pressure, while still giving him the tools he needs to succeed. ”People around Barron describe the speech work as deliberate and private, not a performance for public consumption. “Barron is very focused on how he presents himself now,” another source told Shuter. “He’s thoughtful, deliberate, and wants to be confident when he speaks, but he does it quietly, without drawing attention.” A second insider echoed that point, saying, “He stays away from the spotlight whenever possible. He’s very aware of his privacy, and his mother makes sure it stays that way. Melania is fiercely protective of him.”That instinct to stay out of view has followed him into adulthood. Barron is currently attending classes at NYU’s Washington campus while living in the Executive Residence at the White House, a rare arrangement that places him close to power while keeping him largely unseen. According to those who know him, his focus on speech and presentation is part of a broader effort to define himself on his own terms, separate from viral childhood moments and the political gravity surrounding his parents.Elocution lessons, which emphasise clear articulation, breath control and confident delivery, are often used to refine speech rather than erase identity. In Barron’s case, the work appears less about rejecting his roots than about navigating a future in which every word he says is likely to be noticed. For a young man raised between languages, countries and relentless attention, learning how to speak, and when, may be one of the few choices that remains entirely his own.","Barron Trump, 19, has been taking elocution lessons, training focused on pronunciation and speech clarity.

Minnesota BOILS: Tim Walz Confronts Trump, Activates National Guard Amid Anger As ICE Kills American

What was the X post that Jeff Dean quoted

Jesus Freakin Congress' wrote:

🚨BREAKING: Border Patrol just illegally arrested a U.S. citizen… a TEENAGER… in Richfield, Minnesota. The teen was working at Target when agents tackled him and arrested him, while his passport was in his pocket, fully identifying himself as a U.S. citizen.

None of it mattered.

Why? Because he looked Latino.

When a coworker asked who to call, he said, heartbreakingly: “my mom.”

Think about that. Your teenage son goes to work, and Border Patrol kidnaps him.

This isn’t an isolated incident. ICE and Border Patrol have repeatedly illegally arrested U.S. citizens, especially in Minnesota. And after agents murdered a U.S. citizen who tried to drive away from illegal detention, this should outrage every single American.

U.S. citizens do not have to prove their citizenship. Yet, ICE and Border Patrol agents are routinely violating the Constitution, demanding proof anyway… and even refusing to accept drivers licenses or real IDs.

And now? Even a passport doesn’t matter.

This isn’t enforcement… it’s targeting Americans based on fear and appearance, treating citizens like criminals in their own country.

When will this end? When will the government stop stripping citizens of their rights and labeling them terrorists for simply existing?

Iran Street Fire: 500+ Killed, Say Activists As Tehran Blames Israel & U.S. For Unrest | WATCH





Several supporters of Iran’s exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi were injured on Sunday after a U-Haul truck drove into a crowd during a protest in Los Angeles, triggering chaos and clashes near a federal building in the city’s Westwood neighbourhood.The incident occurred as several hundred demonstrators had gathered to express solidarity with anti-government protests in Iran and oppose the country’s clerical leadership. The rally was part of growing global demonstrations backing protesters inside Iran, where unrest has intensified in recent weeks.According to ABC7 news, a U-Haul box truck drove down a street crowded with marchers, forcing protesters to scramble out of the way. Witnesses said demonstrators then ran after the speeding vehicle and attempted to stop the driver. The truck was later found several blocks away, surrounded by police vehicles, with its side mirrors shattered.A banner on the truck read: “NO SHAH. NO REGIME. USA: DON’T REPEAT 1953. NO MULLAH.” Several protesters were seen tearing signs off the vehicle.According to the video, demonstrators swarmed the truck, punched the driver and used flagpoles to break through the driver’s side window.Shattered glass and debris were scattered across the area as police worked to contain the crowd, ABC7 News reported.Los Angeles police confirmed officers responded to the scene but did not immediately say whether any arrests were made. The Los Angeles Fire Department said two people were evaluated by paramedics but both declined medical treatment. No ambulances were called.""We can confirm that a U-Haul truck plowed through a group of protesters this afternoon. We are still gathering information and do not have the number of injuries as of now,"" LA police department said.Chaos intensified shortly before 3.30 pm when crowds surrounded the U-Haul. Eyewitnesses reported that some protesters smashed the truck’s windows as tensions escalated. Eventually, the crowd pulled a man from the vehicle and law enforcement appeared to take him into custody. As officers escorted him away, some protesters attempted to punch him and strike him with flagpoles.Later, LAPD issued a dispersal order. By around 5 pm, the crowd disappeared, with only about 100 protesters remaining at the scene. The U-Haul was later seen stationary, surrounded by crime scene tape, broken glass and debris.Protesters again flooded the streets of Tehran and Iran’s second-largest city on Sunday, despite a government-imposed internet blackout aimed at limiting the flow of information.Human rights groups estimate that more than 580 people have been killed and over 10,600 detained since the unrest began. Iranian authorities have not released official figures, according to USA Today.The protests initially began in late December over economic hardship but quickly expanded into broader anti-government demonstrations. Iran’s economy has been under severe strain, with the national currency collapsing, inflation hovering around 40%, and prices rising sharply for basic goods such as meat and rice.The unrest has also been fueled by anger over past crackdowns, including the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini in police custody, which triggered nationwide protests.Some demonstrators in Iran have chanted slogans in support of Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran’s last shah, who has repeatedly called for protests. Earlier, Pahlavi urged Iranian security forces and government employees to side with demonstrators.“Employees of state institutions, as well as members of the armed and security forces, have a choice: stand with the people and become allies of the nation, or choose complicity with the murderers of the people,” Pahlavi wrote on social media.The violence in Los Angeles comes as tensions surrounding Iran’s protests draw increasing international attention, with US President Donald Trump warning Tehran against violently suppressing peaceful demonstrators.“We’re watching it very closely,” Trump has said. “If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they’re going to get hit very hard by the United States.”",Several supporters of Iran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi were injured on Sunday after a U-Haul truck drove into a crowd during a protest in Los Angeles. The incident occurred as several hundred demonstrators had gathered to express solidarity with anti-government protests in Iran. The rally was part of growing global demonstrations backing protesters inside Iran.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126475201,imgsize-3618842,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Warning to ISIS

Palmyra attack and escalating response

Tensions flare in Aleppo

US role and ongoing mission





The United States carried out “large-scale” retaliatory strikes against Islamic State targets across Syria on Sunday, following last month’s ambush near Palmyra that killed two US soldiers and an American civilian interpreter.US Central Command said the strikes began around 12.30 pm ET and were conducted alongside partner forces, hitting multiple ISIS targets across the country. A US official told CNN that more than 90 precision munitions were fired using more than two dozen aircraft.Saturday’s strikes are part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, the Trump administration’s response to the December attack that killed Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar, Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard, and civilian interpreter Ayad Mansoor Sakat while they were supporting Operation Inherent Resolve, the US-led mission to defeat ISIS.US Central Command said the strikes were aimed at preventing future attacks and degrading ISIS’s remaining capabilities in Syria.“The strikes today targeted ISIS throughout Syria as part of our ongoing commitment to root out Islamic terrorism against our warfighters, prevent future attacks, and protect American and partner forces in the region,” the command said in a statement on X.“Our message remains strong: if you harm our warfighters, we will find you and kill you anywhere in the world, no matter how hard you try to evade justice,” US Central Command said.The December ambush marked the first deadly attack on US personnel in Syria since the overthrow of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. Torres-Tovar, 25, of Des Moines, Iowa, and Howard, 29, of Marshalltown, were members of the Iowa National Guard. Three other Guard members were injured.Operation Hawkeye Strike was launched on December 19 with a large-scale operation that hit roughly 70 ISIS targets across central Syria. The United States and Jordan also carried out a previous round of strikes under the same operation last month.A day before Saturday’s strikes, Syrian officials said their security forces had arrested the military leader of ISIS’s operations in the Levant.Saturday also saw intense clashes in northern Syria’s Aleppo city, where Syrian government forces deployed in the Kurdish-majority Sheikh Maqsoud neighborhood after days of fighting with Kurdish fighters that left dozens dead and wounded.According to Syria’s state news agency SANA, two Kurdish fighters blew themselves up while surrounded by security forces, causing no casualties. Gunfire was reportedly still heard around noon as security forces urged residents to stay indoors. Later in the day, an explosive drone struck the Aleppo Governorate building shortly after a press conference by two Cabinet ministers and a local official.The clashes began Tuesday in Sheikh Maqsoud, Achrafieh, and Bani Zaid after negotiations between the government and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) stalled over integrating Kurdish forces into the national army. Government forces have since taken control of Achrafieh and Bani Zaid. Five days of fighting killed at least 22 people, including civilians on both sides, according to AP.The United States on Saturday called on the Syrian government and Kurdish authorities to return to negotiations, AFP reported. Conflicting reports emerged from Aleppo, with authorities claiming a halt to fighting and the transfer of Kurdish fighters out of the city, which the Kurdish forces denied.The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have long been the United States’ main partner against ISIS, but since Assad’s ouster, Washington has increasingly coordinated with Syria’s central government in Damascus. Syria recently joined the global coalition against ISIS.Despite President Donald Trump’s skepticism about US involvement in Syria, hundreds of American troops remain deployed as part of Operation Inherent Resolve. In April, the Pentagon announced plans to cut troop levels in half, and in June US envoy Tom Barrack said the United States would eventually reduce its bases in the country to one.","The United States carried out “large-scale” strikes against Islamic State targets across Syria on Sunday.

A pair of Minneapolis women were seen following and taunting ICE agents just days after the fatal shooting of protester Renee Nicole Good, according to footage shared across social media.The footage showed unidentified women being confronted by masked ICE agents in the streets, as one agent warned them: ""Don't make a bad decision today.""""If I continually see you following us, interfering with us, honking your horn, blocking our cars, you have a very high probability of making a really bad decision and being arrested today, okay?"" the officer warned one woman in her car.The woman grinned and responded: ""I think I'm making exactly the right decision.""A man nearby then yelled from the street: ""Why are you giving her a warning? She's not interfering, she's just following.""As the ICE agent again told the woman in the car to ""not make a bad decision today and ruin your life"", she chuckled and replied: ""Oh, bad decisions, that's funny coming from you.""As the ICE agent told the woman to ""have a nice day"" she responded: ""I hope you have a terrible day.""The footage received millions of hits when it was shared to X by Fox News reporter Matt Finn, as many on social media criticised the women for antagonising ICE agents so soon after the shooting of Good.In footage shared by Finn, an ICE agent was seen confronting another woman for allegedly following and harassing federal agents. A woman in a blue car was seen holding her car horn as ICE agents passed by on the road, leading the officer to approach her window and point to her.""Just so you know, if we continue to have you follow us..."" he said, while the woman continually held her car horn down to drown him out.The ICE agent continued: ""Okay, have fun, don't make a bad decision today... don't interfere.""The incident came as the fatal shooting of Good on Wednesday in Minneapolis ignited a political firestorm across the US this week, dividing opinion over whether the shooting was justified.President Trump argued that Good was shot after intentionally accelerating her SUV into ICE agent Jon Ross, 43, causing him to shoot her three times in self-defence.The driver of the black Jeep SUV wore a full-face mask, making it impossible to identify him.Ross became the focus of anger over ICE actions around the country after he shot and killed Good on Wednesday afternoon while she was driving her SUV down a street where agents were on duty, Daily Mail reported.The Trump administration came to Ross's defence over his shooting of Good, while Democratic officials in Minneapolis said it was a murder.ICE claimed she deliberately drove her burgundy SUV at agents, but witnesses disputed the claim, with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey calling it ""bulls**t"".Witnesses said Good and her wife, Rebecca, were acting as legal observers and filming the protest when she was shot, but ICE insisted she tried to use the SUV as a deadly weapon.Footage of the shooting showed Good blocking the road with her car until ICE agents told her to move away. She reversed to head back down the road as an agent tried to open the driver""s side door handle before she drove off. Three shots then rang out.Good lost control of the SUV and slammed it into parked cars and a light pole at high speed, prompting screams from onlookers. Her SUV was seen with a bullet hole through the driver's side windshield.","Two Minneapolis women seen following and taunting ICE agents, according to footage shared across social media.

'Europe Weak & Divided': EU Leader Admits 'DEEP CRISIS' As Trump Threatens Greenland Invasion

US President Donald Trump has directed senior special forces commanders to begin preparing ""contingency plans for a possible invasion of Greenland"", reported the Daily Mail on Sunday.The move, however, has reportedly run into resistance from top military officials who are questioning both its legality and political feasibility.According to the report, Trump has asked the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) to draft an invasion plan. However, the proposal is said to be facing pushback from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who argue that any such operation would be unlawful and lack congressional backing.""The generals think Trump's Greenland plan is crazy and illegal. So they are trying to deflect him with other major military operations. They say it's like dealing with a five-year-old,"" a diplomatic told the Mail.“They have tried to distract Trump by talking about less controversial measures, such as intercepting Russian 'ghost' ships - a clandestine network of hundreds of vessels operated by Moscow to evade Western sanctions - or launching a strike on Iran,” a source told the Mail.Sources familiar with the matter told the Mail that hardline figures within Trump’s inner circle, particularly policy “hawks” led by adviser Stephen Miller, have grown increasingly assertive after what they see as the successful operation to capture Venezuela’s leader Nicolas Maduro.Emboldened by that outcome, they are now pushing for swift action to take control of Greenland before Russia or China is able to expand its influence in the Arctic.Trump’s interest in Greenland may also be driven by domestic political considerations. With mid-term elections approaching later this year, there is concern that the president may seek a dramatic foreign policy move to divert attention from the US economy, amid fears Republicans could lose control of Congress to Democrats,"" the Mail reported, citing British diplomatic sources.Such an action would place Trump on a direct collision course with European leaders and could trigger a profound crisis within the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato), potentially bringing the alliance to breaking point.Diplomatic officials have also reportedly conducted internal war-gaming exercises examining what they describe as an “escalatory scenario,” in which Trump could use military force or sustained political pressure to weaken Greenland’s ties with Denmark.A classified diplomatic cable reportedly outlines a “worst-case” outcome that would result in “the destruction of Nato from the inside.”“Some European officials suspect this is the real aim of the hardline MAGA faction around Trump. Since Congress would not allow Trump to exit Nato, occupying Greenland could force the Europeans to abandon Nato. If Trump wants to end Nato, this might be the most convenient way to do it,” it added.Meanwhile, political parties in Greenland on Saturday issued a joint statement denouncing US President Donald Trump's pressure to seize the Danish autonomous territory.""We don't want to be Americans, we don't want to be Danish, we want to be Greenlanders,"" the leaders of five parties in parliament said.""The future of Greenland must be decided by Greenlanders,"" they added.This came hours after Trump once again spoke about taking action on Greenland, saying the US would have to do “something” or risk Russia and China stepping in. He said Washington does not want Moscow or Beijing as its “neighbours”.""We are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not, because if we don't do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland -- and we're not going to have Russia or China as a neighbour. I would like to make a deal the easy way but if we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way,"" Trump said.""And by the way, I'm a fan of Denmark as well. They've been very nice to me. I'm a big fan but the fact that they had a boat land there 500 years ago doesn't mean that they own the land. We had lots of boats go there also. But we need that because if you take a look at outside of Greenland right now, they are Russian destroyers, Chinese destroyers and bigger there are Russian submarines all over the place. We're not going to have Russia or China occupy Greenland and that's what they're going to do if we don't. We will do something with Greenland either the nice way or the difficult way,"" he added.Denmark has also warned that its troops are under orders to “shoot first and ask question later” if Greenland comes under attack, as concerns grow in Europe over the US openly discussing possible military action against the Arctic territory.Earlier, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen rejected Trump’s claims that the US “needs” Greenland for security reasons, calling them an “unacceptable pleasure”.","US President Donald Trump has directed senior special forces commanders to begin preparing ""contingency plans for a possible invasion of Greenland"" However, the proposal is said to be facing pushback from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who argue that any such operation would be unlawful and lack congressional backing.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126461661,imgsize-35532,width-400,resizemode-4/us-president-trump.jpg"

Here are the top developments



US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that Iran’s leaders have reached out to seek negotiations, suggesting they were under pressure from the United States. ""We may meet with them; a meeting is being set up, but we may have to act because of what is happening before the meeting. But a meeting is being set up,"" Trump said.

The US president also said that Washington is considering “very strong options” for retaliation. “There seem to be some people killed that aren’t supposed to be killed. These are violent, if you call them leaders. I don’t know if their leaders are just ruling through violence, but we’re looking at it very seriously,” Trump told reporters, as cited by CNN.

Trump also said he plans to speak with Elon Musk about restoring internet access in Iran, where authorities have imposed a four-day blackout amid ongoing anti-government protests. “He’s very good at that kind of thing, he’s got a very good company,” Trump told reporters in response to a question about engaging with Musk’s SpaceX-run Starlink satellite internet service, as cited by Reuters.

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei shared a cartoon on X portraying Trump as a crumbling sarcophagus, accompanied by the message, “this one too will be overthrown.” The image depicts Trump as an ancient Egyptian-style coffin marked with the US flag and the Great Seal, cracking apart inside a tomb with the caption, “Like Pharaoh.”

The UN’s Independent International Fact-Finding Mission urged the Iranian authorities to restore internet and mobile communications with immediate effect and to put an end to the violent crackdown on the nationwide protests. In its report, the mission said that, based on “credible information,” Iran’s Supreme National Security Council had instructed security forces to carry out a “decisive” and “unrestrained” crackdown to suppress the demonstrations.

At least 544 people have been killed since the protests started, with the toll expected to rise, activists said on Sunday. More than 10,600 people have been detained over the past two weeks, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. The group said 496 of those killed were protesters, while 48 were members of the security forces.

Hospitals across Iran are undergoing a massive strain as protests escalate, with medical workers reporting a surge of wounded and dead following the crackdown. Emergency services in several provinces, including Tehran, described “bodies piled on top of one another."" Doctors described how overcrowded corridors, overwhelmed emergency rooms and full morgues have made even basic treatment difficult.





US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that Washington is closely monitoring the deadly protests in Iran and weighing potential military retaliation, adding that he has been briefed in recent days on a range of intervention options.When asked how the United States would respond if Iran were to strike American military bases, Trump said, “we will hit them at levels that they’ve never been hit before.”Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said Iran appeared to be approaching the red line he had set over the treatment of protesters, adding, “they’re starting to, it looks like.”When asked if he thinks that Iran takes his threats seriously, a visually agitated Trump responded, ""wouldn't you say that they probably do at this point, after going through it for years with me?... Soleimani, al-Baghdadi, the Iran nuclear threat wiped out... What a stupid question.""Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian had earlier accused the United States and Israel of attempting to destabilise Iran by fomenting unrest. While pledging that the government would hear public grievances, he warned against violent protesters, urging Iranians to stay away from “rioters and terrorists”.Israel, meanwhile, said it is closely monitoring tensions between the US and Iran, an official said, noting that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held overnight talks with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to discuss the situation, as cited by AP.Meanwhile, the UN’s Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Sunday urged Iran to restore internet and mobile communications immediately and to end the violent suppression of the protests.Also read: Iran wants to 'negotiate' with US?

Oil Tankers Flip Trump’s Game? Venezuela’s ‘Dark Mode’ Fleet TRICKS US, Then Comes Back. Here’s Why





US President Donald Trump on Sunday shared an image of his Wikipedia page that described him as the “Acting President of Venezuela”.Shared on Truth Social , the image listed Trump as assuming office on January 20, 2025, and remaining incumbent as of January 2026. It also identified US Vice President JD Vance as his deputy.However, the image appeared doctored, as no official documentation or legal framework exists indicating that the US president holds any governing role in Venezuela as of now.The controversial post comes amid major political and military developments in Venezuela following a US-led operation that resulted in the capture of former Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were detained during a US military operation in Caracas and flown to New York.The pair are being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn and face federal charges related to drug trafficking and alleged cooperation with gangs designated by the US as terrorist organisations. Maduro, however, has denied the allegations.US officials told CBS News that the operation was carried out by the US Army’s Delta Force following months of military build-up in the region, including the deployment of the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R.Ford and other naval assets in the Caribbean.Following Maduro’s removal, Venezuela’s vice president and oil minister, Delcy Rodríguez, was formally sworn in last week as the country’s interim president. Rodríguez, a 56-year-old lawyer and senior figure within the ruling political movement, took the oath before the National Assembly, which is headed by her brother, Jorge Rodríguez.A total of 283 lawmakers elected in parliamentary elections held in May were also sworn in. Most opposition parties boycotted the vote, leaving the legislature dominated by pro-government figures. The only lawmaker absent from the ceremony was Cilia Flores, who remains in US custody, Reuters reported.Earlier, in a statement made in Washington, US President Trump said that the United States would “run” Venezuela temporarily during a transition period and would “get the oil flowing”. He later said the US was “in charge” of Venezuela. However, Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to clarify the administration’s position, saying the US does not intend to directly govern the country but will enforce an “oil quarantine” as part of efforts to influence policy outcomes.","US President Donald Trump on Sunday shared an image of his Wikipedia page that described him as the “Acting President of Venezuela” The image listed Trump as assuming office on January 20, 2025, and remaining incumbent as of January 2026.
