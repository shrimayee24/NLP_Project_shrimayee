NEW DELHI: A Railways employee was filmed throwing garbage from a moving train, prompting his immediate removal the same day.

Social media users condemned the act, calling it a reflection of a broader problem.A video shared on Instagram, by a man who said that he was traveling from Kanpur to Jaipur on Sdah Aii Sf Exp (12987) on November 4, when he saw the railway collect the garbage bag from the bin on-board and threw it on the tracks from the moving train. The passenger further explained in video's caption that he had tried telling the employee that he shouldn't have done it and explain the problem but was met with retort that, ""So what, should I have taken it home then?"".

JNUSU polls: Aditi Mishra becomes JNU’s 1st woman president since 2019; ABVP draws blank as Left sweeps all posts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/left-sweeps-jnusu-polls-first-woman-prez-since-2019/articleshow/125141227.cms,"Left sweeps JNUSU polls, first woman prez since 2019

JNU Clash: Student Union President Among 28 Detained, 6 Cops Injured During Protest Against ABVP





NEW DELHI: In a decisive victory, the Left Unity panel swept all four central posts in the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) elections for 2025-26 on Thursday, with Aditi Mishra of AISA becoming the university's first woman president since Aishe Ghosh in 2019. The results mark a strong comeback for the Left, which had lost one post to ABVP in the delayed 2024-25 polls this April.Mishra, a PhD student from Centre for Comparative Politics and Political Theory, secured 1,937 votes, defeating ABVP's Vikas Patel, who polled 1,488 votes. The margin of 449 votes is up from 272 recorded in the April poll.The presidential candidate of Progressive Students' Association (PSA), Shinde Vijayalaxmi Vyankat Rao, who gained traction among voters with her fiery presidential speech targeting both left and right politics on the campus, took away 1,276 votes while NSUI trailed with 419 votes.In the vice-presidential race, Left's K Gopika Babu from SFI registered the highest tally across all posts, winning by a massive margin of 1,314, up from 34 in the April poll. She secured 3,101 votes while ABVP's Tanya Kumari got 1,787 and NSUI's Shaikh Shahnawaz Alam 370.For the post of general secretary, Left's Sunil Yadav from DSF won by 104 votes, a little dip from April's 114, polling 2,005 votes against ABVP's Rajeshwar Kant Dubey's 1,901.The joint secretary's post was also clinched by Left, with Danish Ali securing 2,083 votes and defeating ABVP's Anuj Damra (1,797) by a margin of 286 votes. In the previous poll, ABVP had bagged this post with a margin of 45.This year's election saw 20 candidates in the fray for the four central panel posts, including six woman candidates, reflecting an increase in women's participation in the campus politics.During the early rounds of counting, when about 4,300 votes were tallied, ABVP was leading on two seats — general secretary and joint secretary. However, once votes from School of Social Sciences and School of Languages were opened, Left secured the lead on all posts. Both these centres have historically voted overwhelmingly for Left candidates.The day-long counting unfolded amid high-decibel sloganeering, drum beats and bursts of celebration as each round was declared. Late at night, tensions briefly flared when a group of students carrying Palestine flags clashed with ABVP supporters. Students alleged that ABVP members tore a flag while ABVP denied the charge, claiming the group had raised anti-govt slogans.Observers say the results reaffirm the united Left's dominance on the campus. The outcome also signals that while new entrants like PSA have injected energy into the campus discourse, the traditional Left remains the primary force shaping student politics at JNU, they add.",The Left Unity panel swept all four central posts in the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) elections for 2025-26 on Thursday.

AGRA: A 34-year-old woman, her lover and her lover's friend were sentenced to life in jail by a court in Agra for murdering her husband after he opposed their relationship. Statements by the couple's children before the magistrate on their mother's involvement in an extra-marital affair proved crucial in the case. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on each of the convicts.The couple's eldest son, 15 years then, had stated: ""My mother is in a two-year affair with a man named Sunil Kumar. Whenever that man visited our place, she used to beat me and my siblings. I saw him and Dharmveer near my house many times. I also alerted my father about them... When my father, an auto driver, used to go out, Sunil used to quietly come and stay in a room with my mom."" His younger siblings - 13 and 8 - made similar claims before the magistrate.ADGC Pradeep Sharma said on February 14, 2019, when Ramveer Singh, 34, went missing from home, his uncle, Tikaram, launched a manhunt. Failing to trace him, Tikaram approached police to file a missing complaint. An FIR was registered two days later against Singh's wife, Kusuma Devi, then 28, lover Sunil Kumar, 28, and Dharmveer Singh, 32, both auto drivers, under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 201 (destroying evidence) at Dauki after Singh's body was found in a village well.The postmortem report revealed 12 injury marks and death due to coma as a result of anti-mortem injury. Prime suspect Kusuma was thereafter arrested on February 17, and police also found the large stick used to beat her husband to death. A burnt phone was recovered too. The other two accused were held on February 19; chargesheet was filed on May 13 that year.During trial, the accused rejected their involvement in Singh's murder and attempted to mislead court by trying to project the latter's proximity to local goons, which led to the killing. However, statements by Kusuma's kids in favour of their dad nailed the trio. Taking witness testimonies, autopsy findings and police evidence into consideration, additional district and sessions judge Sanjay Lal punished the convicts on Friday.","A 34-year-old woman, her lover and her lover's friend were sentenced to life in jail by a court in Agra.

""It is necessary that government conducts a proper investigation and makes facts public,"" he told reporters in Akola, breaking his silence on the row.The Rs 300 crore-deal related to transfer of 40 acres of government-owned land in Mundhwa, Pune, to a company in which Parth is one of two partners has been cancelled, Ajit said Friday after it attracted much criticism.Pawar sr brushed aside questions on why his daughter Supriya Sule seemed to be going ""soft"" on Parth amid the row, saying ""family and politics"" are different aspects. Asked why Supriya had ""defended"" Parth, he said, ""That's her personal opinion.""Asked why Parth had not been named in the FIR lodged in Pune in the case, Pawar said, ""Only the home minister (CM Devendra Fadnavis, who also holds the home portfolio) can provide accurate information on this. He's in the best position to say.""Hours later, Fadnavis told mediapersons in Gadchiroli that ""action is being taken as per law and there's no question of saving anybody"".Pawar sr, however, avoided dragging deputy CM Ajit and Parth into the controversy by limiting his response to asking for a fair probe.He said members within the Pawar family have been political rivals but that should not be mixed with family relations. ""My grandnephew (Yugendra Pawar) contested against Ajit. Within the family we have fought elections against each other,"" he said, adding that social, family and political relations should be seen in silos.On Friday, Supriya refrained from taking on Parth, unlike other Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) allies like Congress. Sule had said, ""I called Parth and he said he has not done anything wrong. If it was govt land, how was it sold? CM and the revenue minister should come out with all details.""Pawar, the architect of MVA, also said the inclusion of Raj Thackeray's Maharashtra Navnirman Sena into MVA fold must be a ""collective decision"". Responding to questions about Congress being reluctant to include MNS in the alliance, Pawar said, ""Leaders of the alliance should sit together and take a joint decision. Congress should not take an extreme position in haste."" He added a meeting of MVA is scheduled in a day or two, where clarity is expected.Regarding a potential alliance with Prakash Ambedkar's Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi, Pawar said, ""Some people met him recently, but the talks didn't progress further.""On Rahul Gandhi's allegations about voter fraud, Pawar said this cannot be brushed aside by authorities. ""EC must address vote rigging concerns.

Explosives Found Near Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah's Event Venue In Bengaluru, Major Attack Foiled

NEW DELHI: Union minister and former Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy on Friday dismissed speculation about a possible change of guard in the southern state, asserting that it would not be “easy” for the ruling Congress to replace incumbent chief minister Siddaramaiah “There will be no chief minister change in Karnataka as is being speculated. It is not easy for the Congress party to remove him,” Kumaraswamy told reporters in Bengaluru, according to news agency PTI.The Janata Dal (Secular) leader described the Congress stalwart as a “capable leader,” noting that he knows this well since Siddaramaiah had earlier been part of the JD(S).“He (Siddaramaiah) was with us earlier; others don’t know what he is. As he was with us earlier, we know what he is capable of doing,” Kumaraswamy said.Rumours of a leadership change have been circulating in Karnataka, with some suggesting it could happen after November 20 — the halfway mark of the Congress government’s five-year term that began in May 2023 — a period some political observers have dubbed the “November Revolution.”“I don’t have any belief in revolutions. Discussions have been going on about a revolution, but there will be none in my opinion,” Kumaraswamy remarked.When asked about deputy chief minister and state Congress chief DK Shivakumar’s chances of succeeding Siddaramaiah, Kumaraswamy took a swipe, saying, “He (Shivakumar) discusses with God every day about when he will be made the chief minister. It is between him and God.”Reacting to Shivakumar’s statement that a “revolution” would happen only in 2028 ""when the Congress returns to power again,"" Kumaraswamy added, “Many in this state in the past have said they will be chief minister or in power for the next ten or twenty years. You have seen what happened to them. Let’s see what happens.”Siddaramaiah, who joined the Congress in 2006 after being expelled from the JD(S) led by former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda, has recently reiterated that he intends to serve the full five-year term, subject to the Congress high command’s ""decision.""",HD Kumaraswamy dismisses speculation about a possible change of guard in Karnataka.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Friday accused India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of committing a ""historic sin"" by truncating certain parts of Vande Matram which hailed Goddess Durga.In a social media post on X, BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan said that Congress, under Nehru's presidentship, adopted only a truncated Vande Mataram as the party’s national song in its 1937 Faizpur session. He also cited Nehru's letter to Subhash Chandra Bose where Nehru said that Vande Matram has nothing to do with Goddess Durga and opines that Vande Mataram is not suitable as a national song.""It is imperative for our younger generation to know how the Congress party brazenly pandering to its communal agenda under the Presidentship of Nehru, adopted only a truncated Vande Mataram as the party’s national song in its 1937 Faizpur Session, while PM Narendra Modi today will inaugurate the 150th year commemoration & participate in the mass recital of the full version of our glorious Vande Mataram across the nation,"" Kesavan said.""The glorious Vande Mataram became the voice of our nation’s unity and solidarity, celebrating our motherland, instilling nationalistic spirit and fostering patriotism. Chanting it was made a criminal offense by the British. It did not belong to any particular religion or language. But the Congress committed the historic sin and blunder of linking the song with religion. Congress under Nehru citing religious grounds deliberately removed stanzas of Vande Mataram which hailed Goddess Ma Durga,"" he added.The BJP leader also attacked leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, claiming that ""Hindu Virodhi mentality"" of Nehru finds a pungent echo in Congress leader's recent remarks on Chatth Puja.""In a letter dated Sep 1, 1937, Nehru spitefully writes that anybody considering the words in Vande Mataram as anything to do with a Goddess was absurd. He also derisively opines that Vande Mataram is not suitable as a national song. Netaji Subash Bose had strongly advocated for the full original version of Vande Mataram. On Oct 20, 1937 Nehru wrote to Netaji Bose claiming that the background of Vande Mataram was likely to irritate Muslims. He went on to say that there does seem to be substance regarding outcry against Vande Mataram and people who are communalistically inclined have been affected by it,"" he said.""In 1937 if Nehru as Congress president blanked out the mention of Goddess Ma Durga by truncating Vande Mataram, Rahul Gandhi in March 2024 maliciously remarked ‘ There is a word called Shakti in Hindu Dharma and we are fighting against Shakti’. The Hindu Virodhi mentality of Nehru finds a pungent echo in Rahul Gandhi who recently demeaned and maligned the sacred Chatth Puja as a drama, hurting the sentiments of crores of devotees,"" he added.This comes as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to launch year long celebrations to commemorate 150 years of national song at Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium on Friday. He will also release a commemorative stamp and coin during the event.The programme will mark the formal launch of the year-long nationwide commemoration of the composition that inspired India's freedom movement and continues to evoke national pride and unity.Composed by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, 'Vande Mataram' was first published in the literary journal 'Bangadarshan' on November 7, 1875.""Later, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee incorporated the hymn in his immortal novel 'Anandamath' which was published in 1882. It was set to music by Rabindranath Tagore. It has become an integral part of the nation's civilisational, political and cultural consciousness,"" a government statement said.","Bharatiya Janata Party accused India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of committing a ""historic sin"" by truncating certain parts of Vande Matram.

WASHINGTON: From the MAGA perspective, millionaires are fleeing Manhattan, cops are quitting NYPD en masse, and the Big Apple is rotting faster than strawberries on a summer day because New York City has fallen…to Communists, Islamists and immigrants. Memes show the Statue of Liberty under a burka or niqab, hammer and sickle projected on the Empire State Building, and public transport overcrowded with immigrants in native grab among other bleak outcomes of Zohran Mamdani victory in the mayoral election. “Imagine North Korea… with a dash of Sharia,” goes one rightwing parody of Frank Sinatra’s song New York, New York.Liberals and progressives meanwhile are cockahoop with delight at the resurgence of the left, reflected in a raft of jokes, some of them self-deprecating, on late-night shows. ""Today Democrats are walking around with a spring in their step like a divorced mom in her 40s whose new haircut just got her carded at two different bars,” riffed Seth Meyers, whose late-night gig on NBC beams from the Rockefeller Center in NYC. Trump’s bete-nore Jimmy Kimmel, whose late-night show on ABC broadcasts from across the country in Hollywood, Los Angeles, joked that President’s social media post after the rout (“...ANDSO IT BEGINS!) “was either a response to Mamdani winning the mayoral race, or he just sat down on the toilet.”Toilet humor aside, the more serious commentariat agreed on one thing: Mamdani’s rise from an obscure local legislator who polled less than 1 percent when he began his campaign to a monumental victory with over 50 percent vote has electrified American politics. Although he is not eligible to run for the White House (he is not born in the U.S., a Constitutional requirement to run for President), many are already seeing him, or at least his policy prescriptions, as a challenge, and perhaps even an opportunity, for MAGA supreme Donald Trump to define him in fearful terms.“His smile is disarming, but his ideas are armed to the teeth,” the Wall Street Journal said of Mamdani’s policies, suggesting that his victory could inspire more leftist candidates to challenge moderate Democrats, allowing President Trump to drive home his message of radical left lunatics taking over America. Trump himself is said to have acknowledged that Mamdani is a “talented politician” and “slick talker,” according to one report.So despite railing against the “communist lunatic,” Trump is now showing signs of learning something from the electoral setback. Pilloried for his tone-deaf bragging about his new White House ballroom and his hosting a Gatsby-themed party at his Mar-o-Lago estate at a time of government shutdown, the President briefly embraced the term “affordability” – which Mamdani flogged during his campaign – while discussing a deal to reduce the price of certain drugs like anti-obesity medications at a White House event on Thursday. Taunted from the left that “Affordability is Trump's word of the week,” the President shrank from the word later, saying “I don’t want to hear about affordability” and insisting that inflation is under control and prices are coming down under him. “My cost are lower than the Democrats on everything, especially oil and gas! So the Democrats “affordability” issue is DEAD! STOP LYING!!!” he posted on Truth Social.But even hard-core MAGA lawmakers previously seen as rabid race-baiters are starting to put affordability issues ahead of immigrant demonisation that has been their go-to issue. “Grocery prices remain high. Energy prices are high. My electricity bills are higher…So, affordability is a problem,” Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has sounded increasingly critical of Trump, in recent weeks, said in a TV interview on Thursday, adding that she is worried about her children’s generation because “they’re having a very hard time. ”Even millionaires and billionaires, said to be decamping NYC in the face of the ""socialist surge"" seemed to acknowledge Mamdani has raised important issues. ""Congrats on the win. Now you have a big responsibility. If I can help NYC, just let me know what I can do,"" Bill Ackman, billionaire hedge fund manager and NewYorker who contributed $ 1 million to Mamdani's opponent Andrew Cuomo, posted soon after Mamdani's win.",Zohran Mamdani won the NYC mayoral election with over 50 percent of the vote. His victory is being seen as an opportunity for MAGA supreme Donald Trump to define him in fearful terms. Trump is now showing signs of learning something from the electoral setback. Even hard-core MAGA lawmakers previously seen as rabid race-baiters are starting to put affordability issues ahead of immigrant demonisation.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125167007,imgsize-891801,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Pakistan Fires Into Afghanistan, Breaks Ceasefire Amid Turkey Peace Talks: Taliban Confirms





Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif on Friday said the dialogue between Pakistan and Afghanistan has effectively collapsed, noting that the process has “entered an indefinite phase” after negotiators failed to narrow key differences, reported Dawn News.Officials and security sources earlier confirmed there was no breakthrough.“The talks in Istanbul are deadlocked,” a senior security source told the Pakistani daily, indicating the discussions had reached an impasse.Asif said the government had concluded that ""the talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan are over,"" signalling the end of the latest round of diplomatic engagement aimed at easing cross-border tensions.The collapse in talks follows weeks of fighting along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border that has resulted in civilian and military casualties on both sides, marking the deadliest escalation in years.The violence began after an October 9 explosion in Kabul and another in Paktika the same day which Afghan government blamed on Pakistan. Pakistani officials have neither confirmed nor denied involvement in the blasts, and neither side issued details on casualties from the initial incidents.Since October 9, repeated shelling and exchanges of fire have killed dozens, though casualty figures differ widely. Earlier this week, Pakistan's military spokesman Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif said more than 200 Afghan soldiers and more than 100 militants were killed when Pakistani forces targeted militant hideouts and army positions in Afghanistan after coming under attack.Afghan government spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid rejected that assessment, saying only nine Afghan soldiers had been killed and 22 wounded, while claiming that up to 45 civilians had been killed and 102 wounded in the strikes. Mujahid also claimed 58 Pakistani soldiers had been killed, a figure Pakistan disputed, stating that 23 of its soldiers had died in the fighting.The worsening violence prompted Qatar to mediate, bringing the two sides to Doha for talks that led to a ceasefire on October19.Two additional rounds were later held in Istanbul. While both sides say the ceasefire technically remains in place, sporadic attacks have continued.An Afghan official told news agency AP on Friday that overnight clashes in the border region killed four Afghan civilians and wounded five others.The two countries share a 2,611-kilometre border known as the Durand Line. Established in 1893, the line cuts through the traditional homeland of the Pashtun people, Afghanistan’s largest ethnic group and the core base of the Afghan Taliban.Although the frontier is internationally recognised as Pakistan’s border, Afghanistan has long refused to accept it.",Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif said the dialogue between Pakistan and Afghanistan has effectively collapsed. Asif noted that the process has “entered an indefinite phase’ after negotiators failed to narrow key differences.

'Don't lecture about Indian literacy rates': American CEO James Fishback's jibe at Vivek Ramaswamy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dont-lecture-about-indian-literacy-rates-american-ceo-james-fishbacks-jibe-at-vivek-ramaswamy/articleshow/125161003.cms,"CEO James Fishback took a veiled dig at Vivek Ramaswamy as he mentioned India, maths olympiad in his recent America First speech.





Azoria CEO and ex-DOGE architect James Fishback took a dig at GOP leader Vivek Ramaswamy without naming him and said Americans should not be apologetic about who they are and nobody should lecture Americans on India's literacy or Chinese maths. Americans won't change their culture for a maths olympiad or for a Chemistry exam, Fishback said as he was giving a speech at Boston University College Republicans. The ex-DOGE architect has emerged as a strong anti-H-1B voice.""We don't want ANYONE lecturing us about Indian literacy rates or Chinese math rates. Cut the crap now. We’re Americans. We’re talented. We’re smart. And no, we’re not giving up church on Sunday for more math tutoring. We’re not skipping Friday Night Lights because there’s a chemistry test to cram for. The second we stop apologizing for who we are, we will start winning again!"" Fishback said.The America First CEO has been pushing for completely stopping the H-1B visa program and said that a foreigner should only come to the US for tourism.Fishback's reference to math tutoring, chemistry test was a jibe at Indian-origin Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy who last year created a major uproar in the H-1B controversy as he attacked American culture to justify the H-1B program.Ramaswamy said American culture worships mediocrity over excellence, celebrates prom queen over math olympiad and hence tech companies need to hire foreign employees as there is a dearth of Americans in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.While Vivek's critique of American culture turned out to be a watershed moment for MAGA, with Vivek becoming sidelined, the H-1B conundrum still persists. The Donald Trump administration has imposed a $100,000 fee on hiring H-1Bs, making it difficult for tech companies to hire from foreign countries. Florida has recently announced a ban on H-1Bs in Florida colleges and universities as Governor Ron DeSantis revealed that instead of special positions, the colleges and universities made foreign hiring for some very basic posts, like a public policy professor from China, a graphic designer from Canada.","Azoria CEO and ex-DOGE architect James Fishback took a dig at GOP leader Vivek Ramaswamy without naming him.

University of Pennsylvania cyber attack: Data worth million exposed





The University of Pennsylvania has confirmed that hackers gained access to several of its internal systems linked to development and alumni activities, stealing confidential data in the process, reports BleepingComputer. The breach, discovered on October 31, occurred after attackers obtained employee credentials through a social engineering scam.""Penn employs a robust information security program; however, access to these systems occurred due to a sophisticated identity impersonation commonly known as social engineering,"" the university said in a statement.The university said its staff quickly locked down the affected systems to stop further intrusions but not before an “offensive and fraudulent email” was sent to members of the Penn community.The university further revealed that it has alerted the FBI and is working with cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike to investigate the incident.According to BleepingComputer’s report, the attackers accessed Penn’s Salesforce donor database, SharePoint files, and other platforms, stealing around 1.71 GB of data. This includes sensitive personal and financial information of alumni and donors such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email IDs, and donation histories.The hackers claimed to have obtained records of roughly 1.2 million donors, including details like “gift histories, wealth ratings, and lifetime commitment amounts.” They also said they sent a mass email to nearly 700,000 people after discovering their access was revoked.The attackers told BleepingComputer that the breach wasn’t politically motivated but aimed at Penn’s “vast, wonderfully wealthy donor database.” However, their communications also included sharp criticism of the university’s diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.The university says it is now strengthening its security systems, conducting staff training on social engineering, and enhancing monitoring tools.Once the probe concludes, Penn plans to notify affected individuals. The university has also urged students, alumni, and donors to stay alert for suspicious emails or phone calls that could be phishing attempts.","University of Pennsylvania has confirmed that hackers gained access to several of its internal systems linked to development and alumni activities.

Angry Customer Tosses Hot Coffee at Michigan McDonald's Manager in Disturbing New Video

Warrant issued after public tips



Previous high-profile coffee injury







A woman in Michigan has been filmed hurling a large cup of scalding coffee at a McDonald’s manager during a furious meltdown over her order, police confirmed. The shocking incident took place on Tuesday morning at the chain’s Saginaw branch and was later shared online by Buena Vista Police, prompting an outpouring of tips that quickly identified the suspect.The woman, named by police as 48-year-old Casharra Brown, was seen on CCTV angrily confronting the manager after claiming she had waited more than an hour for her online order and demanding a refund. In the footage, Brown repeatedly called the worker a “liar” while the manager tried to explain the refund process.“You’ve got your coffee,” the manager said. “That’s all that you were charged for. Your refund will take up to 48 hours.”As the manager turned away, Brown tore the lid from the cup, leaned over the counter and threw the hot coffee at the worker’s back. She then went on to hurl expletives at the manager before shouting, “Catch that hot-a– coffee!”The manager screamed in pain as Brown stormed out of the restaurant. Police later said the victim suffered minor injuries and did not require hospital treatment.Authorities released the video on social media, which sparked a rush of information from the public.Buena Vista detective Russ Pahssen said: “I must have gotten about 100 tips,” adding that Brown was identified “within about two minutes”.Police say they know where Brown lives but have so far been unable to find her. A warrant has been issued for her arrest, and officers have asked prosecutors to charge her with felonious assault.Brown reportedly became angry after ordering through the McDonald’s app without entering her name or payment details. The manager initially offered her a coffee to calm the situation, but the confrontation escalated instead.The incident drew comparisons to the well-known 1994 case of Stella Liebeck, who suffered third-degree burns after McDonald’s coffee spilled on her and won a jury award of $160,000 in compensatory damages, with a judge later reducing punitive damages from $2.7 million to $480,000.Police say they are continuing efforts to locate Brown.","Casharra Brown, 48, was filmed hurling a large cup of scalding coffee at a McDonald's manager during a furious meltdown over her order, police confirmed.

PUNE: The state govt has formed two committees to carry out an investigation into the controversial land deal in Pune in which Parth Pawar has been embroiled.

The same thing did not happen in this case. I was also not aware of it, otherwise, I would have told them not to go ahead with the deal.""He added, ""Considering that it is govt-owned land, the deal should not have happened, but somebody showed the daring of proceeding with the deal. Now the committees are carrying out inquiries to find out if anybody influenced the officials for it.""An FIR has been registered in this connection at Bavdhan police station naming Parth's partner in the company Digvijay Patil, Sheetal Tejwani, who held the power of attorney, and the suspended sub-registrar, Ravindra Taru.

Street Racer Loses Control, His Car Rams Into Pedestrians Outside Bar In Florida; 4 Dead, 11 Injured

Fatal Crash in Ybor: November 8, 2025





Four people were killed and eleven others injured when a speeding car fleeing police ploughed into a crowd outside a popular bar in Tampa’s historic Ybor City early on Saturday.The incident occurred near Bradley’s on 7th, a well-known nightlife venue in the area, shortly after midnight.According to the Tampa Police Department, a silver sedan driven by 22-year-old Silas Sampson was first seen street racing on Hillsborough Avenue before being spotted by an air patrol unit around 12:40 am (local time).As per AP, the Florida Highway Patrol tried to intercept the vehicle using a PIT manoeuvre — a tactic that forces a car to spin out — but the attempt failed.Officers later disengaged as the vehicle sped towards downtown Tampa.Moments later, Sampson lost control of his car and crashed into a group of 15 people gathered outside the bar.Three victims died at the scene, while a fourth succumbed to injuries at a nearby hospital.Police said two of the injured were in critical condition, seven were stable and two were treated and released.Another two declined treatment for minor injuries.“This morning’s incident was a senseless tragedy,” Tampa Police Chief Lee Bercaw said in a statement cited by both outlets.“Reckless driving put innocent lives in danger. The Tampa Police Department and the Florida Highway Patrol are committed to seeking justice for the victims and their families”, Bercaw added, as per NBC News.The suspect, Sampson, was arrested and booked into the Hillsborough County Jail, according to AP.Court records show he faces four counts of vehicular homicide and four counts of aggravated fleeing or eluding with serious bodily injury or death, all first-degree felonies.In a statement quoted by NBC News, Bradley’s on 7th owner Bradley Nelson said the car struck three people on the sidewalk before crashing into the bar’s patio. “This event has been very traumatic for my entire staff and myself. Our thoughts and prayers go to the families of those who were killed, and to all the injured,” Nelson said.Tampa Mayor Jane Castor, a former police chief, said on social media, “Our entire city feels this loss,” adding that the investigation remains ongoing.The crash has reignited debate over police pursuit policies in the United States. While some agencies have restricted high-speed chases due to rising fatalities, Florida’s highway patrol has recently eased such limits, allowing for more frequent use of high-risk PIT manoeuvres.","A speeding car fleeing police ploughed into a crowd outside a popular bar in Tampa’s historic Ybor City early on Saturday.

SmugAlana’s viral post deepens anger as fans call Twitch “dishonest”





Twitch is facing huge backlash after its apology for the assault on popular streamer Emiru (Emily Schunk) at TwitchCon San Diego. The platform said it “failed to keep Emiru safe” and promised to donate to anti-sexual violence groups. But fans and creators say Twitch is lying, hiding facts, and not taking sexual assault seriously. A viral community note under Twitch’s post claimed the company “lied on several occasions” and even withheld video evidence.Many users also said Twitch let the man who assaulted Emiru walk free. The outrage grew when another streamer, SmugAlana, mocked Twitch online for unbanning a creator accused of sexual assault after only a one-week ban. Fans now accuse Twitch of hypocrisy and protecting wrongdoers. The issue has become a huge PR disaster for the company, with growing calls for CEO Dan Clancy to take real action, or step down.After Twitch’s post on November 7, streamer SmugAlana shared a meme mocking the company. She wrote, “Nobody is taking this seriously after you unbanned a chick who sexually assaulted a dude on stream after 1 week. You ban people for longer for less.”Her post went viral fast, getting thousands of likes and reposts. Many agreed with her, saying Twitch’s punishments seem unfair and confusing.A community note added to Twitch’s apology made things worse. It accused the platform of lying multiple times, not giving full details, and hiding key evidence. Some users said Twitch claimed the attacker was detained, but video proof showed he simply walked away. Others slammed CEO Dan Clancy, saying he was “out partying” while calling Emiru a “friend” online.Fans and creators are now calling for real changes, like stronger event safety, clear rules for bans, and full transparency. Many said Twitch acts fast for small mistakes, but slow and soft when serious issues happen.By November 8, the backlash had spread beyond fans to advertisers and sponsors. Critics say Twitch’s weak response to sexual assault shows “broken priorities.” For many creators, the Emiru case is no longer just one event, it’s a symbol of how Twitch fails to protect its own streamers and ignores serious problems until they go viral.Also Read: YouTuber Candace Owens Fires Back At Ben Shapiro After He Claims She Accused Erika Kirk Of Killing Charlie Kirk","Twitch is facing huge backlash after its apology for the assault on popular streamer Emiru.

An Indian-origin employee working in the Illinois department of transportation was stopped and questioned about his immigration status while working on a Park Ridge construction project on Friday, according to the Chicago Sun Times.The employee was also asked about incoming New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, according to Governor JB Pritzker’s office, which said the incident raised concerns over racial profiling.The employee was a US citizen working on the Busse Highway resurfacing project when three masked agents reportedly approached him. They questioned him about his immigration status, whether he had travelled to New York, and if he was aware of Mamdani’s mayoral election, before leaving the site.Governor Pritzker condemned the federal action, calling it an example of authorities questioning US citizens “apparently based on the colour of their skin.”“I am appalled they would stop and question a state employee working hard on the job to help improve our state’s roads and infrastructure,” Pritzker said in a statement. “Our state employees should be able to go to work and do their jobs without masked agents targeting them for no legitimate reason.”The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) later denied that the agents were from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or US Customs and Border Protection.The incident worried residents in Park Ridge. Students and teachers in the local school district were instructed to remain inside after reports of federal agents in the area, WGN reported. Park Ridge-Niles School District 64 Superintendent Ben Collins confirmed he was aware of reports regarding federal immigration agents near some of the district’s schools.The episode comes after months of heightened federal immigration activity under the Trump administration’s MAGA crackdown. It has raised concerns among civil rights groups about potential targeting based on race and nationality.The GOP government sought to deploy the National Guard in Chicago amid a wider immigration enforcement surge dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz”.

SNAP benefits: US federal judge orders Trump administration to release full payments amid shutdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/snap-benefits-us-federal-judge-orders-trump-administration-to-release-full-payments-amid-shutdown/articleshow/125146989.cms,"Trump’s SNAP Cuts Leave Millions Hungry Amid Shutdown; White House Announces 'Partial' Payments





SNAP recipients will now not go without food support, as a US federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to deliver full benefit payments to states by Friday.In Rhode Island on Thursday, US District Judge John J. McConnell Jr. ordered the administration to disburse the payments through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, though it was unlikely the 42 million Americans — about one in eight — would see the money on their food debit cards so swiftly, AP news agency reported.The order followed a challenge by cities and non-profit organisations that the administration had proposed covering only 65 per cent of the maximum benefit, which might leave some recipients without any payment this month.“The defendants failed to consider the practical consequences associated with this decision to only partially fund SNAP,” McConnell said. “They knew that there would be a long delay in paying partial SNAP payments and failed to consider the harms individuals who rely on those benefits would suffer.”McConnell was one of two judges who ruled last week that the administration could not skip November’s benefits entirely because of the federal shutdown.Last week’s rulings required the govt to use an emergency reserve fund containing $4.6 billion to pay for SNAP for November but gave it leeway to tap other money to make the full payments, which cost between $8.5 billion and $9 billion each month.On Monday, the administration said it would not use additional funds, arguing that Congress must appropriate the programme’s money. The following day, President Trump appeared to threaten withholding the benefits entirely unless Congressional Democrats agreed to reopen the government. His press secretary later clarified that partial benefits would be paid for November and that future payments were at risk if the shutdown persisted.Late on Wednesday, the USDA, which administers the programme, filed in federal court in Rhode Island that further analysis had shown the maximum benefit would amount to just 65 per cent of the usual sum.After the US federal government shut down at the start of October, Congress was unable to approve additional spending, resulting in states not receiving funds to top up participants’ SNAP cards. The programme worked by issuing reloadable debit cards that people could use to buy essential grocery items at supermarkets or via Amazon for grocery delivery. Although states administered the programme themselves, they relied heavily on funding from the federal govt.",US judge orders full benefits to be paid to 42 million Americans by Friday. Order follows challenge by cities and non-profit organisations.

Trump Takes One Last Jab at Pelosi, Calls Retirement “A Great Thing for the Country”

Nancy Pelosi's historic clashes with Trump









President Donald Trump said Nancy Pelosi's retirement will be a great thing for America as she was 'evil, corrupt and focused on bad things for our country'. Fox News reported Trump's reaction to Pelosi's retirement. ""She was rapidly losing control of her party and it was never coming back. I’m honored she impeached me twice and failed miserably twice. Nancy Pelosi is a highly overrated politician,"" Trump said as reported by Fox's Peter Doocy.The first and only female Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi announced her retirement as she said she would not seek reelection. In a video, she said: ""I have truly loved serving as your voice in Congress, and I have always honored the song of St. Francis, ‘Lord make an instrument of thy peace,’ the anthem of our city. That is why I want you, my fellow San Franciscans, to be the first to know. I will not be seeking reelection to Congress. ""“With a grateful heart, I look forward to my final year of service as your proud representative. As we go forward, my message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power. We have made history. We have made progress. We have always led the way, and now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our Democracy and fighting for the American ideals we hold dear.”There were speculations for days that Pelosi would soon announce her retirement and she was expected to leave Congress after this time, her first in decades as a rank-and-file member.Reflecting on her many roles on Capitol Hill, Pelosi said Thursday: “I say to my colleagues in the House all of the time, no matter what title they had bestowed upon me – speaker, leader, whip – there has been no greater honor for me than to stand on the House floor and say, ‘I speak for the people of San Francisco.’”In September 2019, Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump, citing his solicitation of foreign assistance and a betrayal of national security. The showdown entered public view in dramatic fashion in 2020 when, during Trump’s State of the Union address, Pelosi tore up a copy of his speech immediately after, calling it a “manifesto of mistruths.” After January 6, 2021, Pelosi condemned Trump's role in inciting the the mob, describing his subsequent visit to the Capitol as “returning to the scene of the crime. ”","President Donald Trump said Nancy Pelosi's retirement will be a great thing for America as she was 'evil, corrupt and focused on bad things for our country' The first and only female Speaker of the US House of Representatives announced her retirement as she said she would not seek reelection.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125137197,imgsize-906604,width-400,resizemode-4/donald-trump-said-it39s-great-news-for-america-that-nancy-pelosi-is-retiring.jpg"

US President Donald Trump has once again reiterated his old claim that India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after his intervention.Speaking at an event in Miami, Florida, on Wednesday, Trump added new details to his claims, saying that after his intervention, the next day he received a call claiming that they had made peace after he put out trade conditions.Trump claimed he had solved eight wars in the nine months he had been in office and played a key role in bringing India and Pakistan to a truce. “You know, I was in the midst of a trade deal with both of them (India and Pakistan), and then I read on the front page of a certain newspaper... I heard they were going to war,"" PTI news agency quoted Trump as saying, adding that a total of eight planes had been shot down during the military conflict.His previous claim stood at seven.“I said, this is war, and they are going at it. And they are two nuclear nations. I said, ‘I'm not going to make any trade deals with you guys unless you agree to peace,"" Trump said, adding that his statement took both India and Pakistan by shock.""The two nations said 'No way. This has nothing to do...’ I said, ‘It has everything to do. You are nuclear powers. I'm not trading with you. We're not making any deals with you if you're at war with each other'.""As per the claim made by Trump, this conversation with India and Pakistan took place on May 9. On May 10-2025, both countries announced they had come to a ceasefire understanding and would stop all fighting.""A day later, I get a call saying, 'We made peace'. They stopped. I said, 'Thank you. Let's do trade'. Isn't that great? Tariffs did that… Without tariffs, that would have never happened,"" Trump said amid applause.Trump’s tariff announcement had imposed a 25 percent levy on India in response to what he described as ""the highest tariffs on US goods"" and a 19 percent tariff on Pakistan. He later added an extra 25 percent on India, taking the total to 50 percent, as a penalty for New Delhi’s purchase of Russian oil and its participation in the BRICS bloc, which, according to Trump, fostered anti-American policies.India has repeatedly denied US involvement in the truce. During the G7 Summit in Canada earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi rejected Trump’s claim.“President Trump clearly that during this period, there was no talk at any stage on subjects like India-US trade deal or US mediation between India and Pakistan,” said Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri in a press statement.The conflict between India and Pakistan escalated after New Delhi launched a tri-service strike called ‘ Operation Sindoor ’, targeting terror camps across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The operation followed a terror attack in April in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, in which 26 tourists were killed.","US President Donald Trump has once again reiterated his old claim that India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after his intervention.

Shocking Video: UPS Cargo Plane Explodes After Takeoff In Louisville | FAA, NTSB Probe Deadly Crash

Trail of debris





WASHINGTON: Freight carriers UPS and FedEx said they have grounded their fleets of MD-11 cargo planes, after one of them was involved in a deadly crash in Kentucky this week.A McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft operated by UPS exploded into flames when it crashed shortly after departing on Tuesday from the airport in the US city of Louisville, killing at least 14 people. A three-person crew was aboard.Both carriers said they were acting on a recommendation from the plane's manufacturer to halt use of these planes. McDonnell Douglas originally made the MD-11 but was acquired by Boeing in 1997.""Out of an abundance of caution and in the interest of safety, we have made the decision to temporarily ground our MD-11 fleet,"" UPS said Friday.""The grounding is effective immediately. We made this decision proactively at the recommendation of the aircraft manufacturer,"" the courier added.It said around nine percent of UPS's fleet are MD-11s.FedEx said Saturday it, too, had grounded its 28 MD-11s out of a total fleet of around 700 aircraft as it conducts a safety review.""With safety as our top priority, we recommended to the three operators of the MD-11 Freighter that they suspend flight operations while additional engineering analysis is performed,"" Boeing said in a statement.Besides UPS and FedEx, the only other carrier using the MD-11 is Western Global Airlines.Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said another crash victim had been located, bringing the total number to 14.""Please pray for these families, the Louisville community and everyone affected by this terrible event,"" he said on X.The plane, filled with around 38,000 gallons (144,000 liters) of fuel for the long-haul flight to Hawaii, narrowly missed a major Ford vehicle assembly plant that employs about 3,000 people.Aerial footage of the crash site showed a long trail of debris as firefighters poured water on the flames, with smoke billowing from the area.Investigators have said the accident was caused by one of the engines catching fire and detaching during takeoff.Todd Inman, a member of the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), said this week that investigators had identified the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder -- known as a plane's black boxes -- and would send them to Washington for analysis.The crash was reportedly the deadliest in UPS history. Its main hub, Worldport, is in Louisville, where it employs thousands of people.According to the NTSB, the plane was built in 1991 and was modified into a cargo aircraft. McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing in 1997.The crash comes amid the longest government shutdown in US history, with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warning this week of ""mass chaos"" in the skies due to a lack of air traffic control staff.Inman said the NTSB was not aware of any staff shortages at Louisville's airport at the time of the crash.",UPS and FedEx say they have grounded their fleets of MD-11 cargo planes.

Former Trump loyalist and top MAGA activist Steve Bannon once again became a centre of mockery on social media after making a dramatic prediction about the 2028 US presidential election.Speaking at a Conservative event on Thursday, the former Donald Trump strategist warned supporters that a Democratic victory could have harsh consequences for people in the room, including himself.Bannon told attendees: “If we lose the mid-terms and we lose 2028, some in this room are going to prison – myself included. They’re not going to stop; they’re getting more and more and more radical. We have to counter that, and what do we have to counter it with? We have to counter it with more action, more intense action, more urgency.”The clip went viral on X, where netizens ridiculed both tone and message.Democratic strategist Mike Nellis said: “‘if we lose, we’re going to be held accountable for our crimes’ is not the campaign slogan Steve Bannon thinks it is.”British Muslim Journalist Mehdi Hasan reacted by joking that Bannon was “promising everyone a good time.”Several memes also circulated, with users comparing his warning to a movie villain's speech or pointing out the accidental honesty of the remark.Bannon has been making frequent references to 2028 in recent days. Earlier in the week, he insisted that Donald Trump could somehow serve a third term as president, despite clear constitutional limits. He has also suggested there is “a plan” to get around the restriction and urged the public to “get accommodated” with the idea of Trump appearing on the ballot again.For many online, however, Bannon’s latest warning became another moment of ridicule rather than alarm.","Bannon warned that a Democratic victory could have harsh consequences for people in the room, including himself.

Maxwell is much 'happier and calm' in the new prison





Congress questions ‘VIP treatment’ to Maxwell





Anger inside and outside Bryan





Ongoing row around Epstein









Sex offender and trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has described her new life inside a Texas minimum-security prison as calmer, cleaner, and far safer than the Florida facility where she previously served her 20-year sentence for recruiting minors for late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein Emails reviewed by NBC News revealed that Maxwell has been praising the living conditions of the women’s Federal Prison Camp, Bryan. However, lawmakers are on her nose, investigating whether she is receiving special treatment or not.Maxwell was moved from a low-security Tallahassee prison to the all-women’s FPC Bryan in early August. The camp usually houses inmates with nonviolent convictions, which made her transfer highly unusual.Within days of her arrival, Maxwell emailed friends and relatives, describing her surroundings in glowing terms. “The institution is run in an orderly fashion which makes for a safer more comfortable environment for all people concerned, inmates and guards alike,” she wrote.In another detailed message, she compared the facilities of Bryan to her previous facility, saying, “The food is legions better, the place is clean, the staff responsive and polite.”She added that she had not witnessed the violence, drug use or chaos she said she saw in Tallahassee. “In other words I feel like I have dropped through Alice in Wonderlands looking glass. I am much much happier here and more importantly safe.”Her transfer and the tone of her emails were not really appreciated by Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight Committee. Jamie Raskin wrote to the warden asking why Maxwell appears to have special privileges, citing a Wall Street Journal report alleging special meals delivered to her dorm room, late-night workouts and private shower use.Raskin said inmates claimed they were told not to speak about Maxwell and faced retaliation for doing so. “You have provided no such justification for why prison security requires a ‘Ghislaine Maxwell’ gag order,” he wrote.Other inmates confirmed the details reviewed by the committee. One wrote that “NO inmates is allowed to prepare her meals.”Ghislaine's brother Ian Maxwell said any leaked messages were “stolen without authorisation.”Her transfer has caused frustration among prisoners and residents. One inmate, Julie Howell, was moved out of Bryan after speaking badly to the media about Maxwell’s presence, according to her lawyer.Community organiser Raequel Rogers questioned why Maxwell was placed there at all. “We want a better prison system for all, but why is she being shown privilege?” she asked. “We don’t want a child sex trafficker here.”The Federal Bureau of Prisons policy states that sex offenders must be held in at least low-security facilities unless a special waiver is granted.Maxwell being in jail remains a highly sensitive issue for many Americans, as she is the last close witness to Jeffrey Epstein who could potentially reveal more about his operations. She could even disclose whether any MAGA-aligned figures were involved in Epstein’s parties, like Donald Trump. If that is the case, her transfer to a safer and more comfortable facility may be seen as an attempt to influence her, keep her silent or even pressure her, as some Democrats have alleged. The Epstein files still have not been released, despite former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi claiming before Trump’s second term that she would make them public.","Ghislaine Maxwell has described her new life inside a Texas minimum-security prison as calmer, cleaner, and far safer than the Florida facility where she previously served her 20-year sentence.

Former US President Joe Biden delivered one of his strongest attacks yet on MAGA chief Donald Trump during a speech in Omaha on Friday, accusing the president of damaging America’s institutions and mocking his remodel of the White House.Speaking at a Nebraska Democratic Party gala, the former president told supporters he believed Trump’s actions had gone far beyond what he had expected.“I knew Trump was going to taking a wrecking ball to the country, but I had no idea, I have to admit, I didn’t know there was going to be an actual wrecking ball,” Biden said, referring to Trump’s demolition of the East Wing to build a vast 90,000 square foot, 300$ million ballroom in White House. “It’s a perfect symbol of his presidency. Trump has taken a wrecking ball not only to the people’s house but to the Constitution, to the rule of law, to our very democracy. ”Biden also mocked Trump’s claim that the United States is living through “a golden age”. He said, “He now says we are quote ‘in a golden age.’ The only gold is the stuff he’s hanging on the mantle,” slamming the ornate additions Trump has made to the Oval Office.Speaking at times as though Trump were in the room, Biden said, “You act in a way that embarrasses us as a nation, quite frankly.” He argued that Trump has prioritised the interests of his wealthy friends, saying, “You work for us, Mr. President. We don’t work for you. You work for us, not just billionaires and millionaires. I’m angry.”Biden also spoke about his recent prostate cancer treatment and used his own experience to discuss the importance of affordable health care. “I thank God for the doctors and the nurses and the incredible breakthroughs we’re making in cancer research,” he said. “Now Trump and his Republican friends are cutting government funding for health care and making it more expensive, more expensive for virtually everyone. ”His remarks came during the country’s longest-ever government shutdown. Democrats have refused to back the Republican funding bill because it excludes an extension of the subsidies that expire at the end of the year, according to CNN.Biden celebrated Tuesday’s sweeping Democratic victories, saying, “The Democratic party is back!” Wins included Zohran Mamdani’s election as New York City mayor, and gubernatorial victories for Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey. A Democrat-backed redistricting measure also passed in California.He said the results show that “the American people are sending a message … to Trump and to his crowd,” and that they have rejected Trump’s agenda.Biden closed with a message of defiance, saying, “I know this nation.

'Sleepy Don': Trump Seemingly Dozes Off At Worst Possible Time Amid Chaotic Oval Office Briefing

Also read:





Growing allegations that the Trump family is drunk with power took a new high this week following a Forbes report that US military stores are now selling Trump-branded wines.The controversy erupted after the magazine reported that Trump-labelled wines and ciders had appeared on shelves of duty free stores for military personnel in Washington DC and Centreville, Virginia ahead of the holiday season. Administration officials confirmed the sales but maintained it did not violate any laws. Trump surrogates insisted the products, like many other Trump branded goods, were part of a licensing arrangement, and the President’ had no role in the same.However, watchdog groups decried the sales as a blatant monetization of federal facilities, even if no direct legal violation could be proven. ""This is one of those things where there probably isn’t any legal issue, but there is an optics and an ethics issue,"" said Jordan Libowitz spokesperson for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), adding that if the government buys the products wholesale, it could violate the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, barring presidents from extra benefits beyond salary.The incident though fits a broader pattern of the Trump family's alleged self-enrichment, including forays into crypto ventures that critics say has derailed US-India ties. In early 2025, World Liberty Financial (WLF)—a decentralized finance platform majority-owned by the Trump family (including Donald Trump as ""Chief Crypto Advocate"" and sons Eric and Donald Jr. in leadership roles, with a reported 60% stake)—signed a high-profile Letter of Intent with Pakistan's newly formed Crypto Council (PCC). The deal, which some observers say may have emboldened the Pakistani deep state to pull off the Pahalgam terrorist attack on April 26, was led by WLF co-founder Zachary Witkoff, son of Trump's longtime ally and diplomatic troubleshooter Steve Witkoff.The partnership has fueled accusations of conflicts of interest, with critics like former US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan suggesting it may have prompted Trump’s kid-glove treatment of Pakistan and prioritizing it over India. In a September 2025 Meidastouch podcast, Sullivan stated Trump ""threw the India relationship over the side"" due to Pakistan's business overtures, undermining decades of US-India alignment on technology, economics, and countering China.There have been more dodgy developments since. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who had advised Pakistan’s Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on positioning the country as a crypto hub, won a full and unconditional pardon from Trump late last month after he had pled guilty in November 2023 to violating US anti-money laundering laws and served a four-month prison sentence. Trump later told CBS 60 minutes he did not know who Zhao was even though he issued him a pardon.The Trump dispensation’s lavish pursuits, including the building of a White House ball room and a ""Great Gatsby""-themed Halloween gala he threw last week at Mar-a-Lago, complete with flapper dancers, feather-adorned guests, and champagne toasts, all evocative ofF. Scott Fitzgerald's tale of excess and inequality, have drawn sharp rebukes for insensitivity, coming particularly during a government shutdown. “Nothing says ‘I feel your pain’ like champagne flutes and flapper girls while kids go hungry. Happy Halloween from Count Dracula of Empathy,” the late-night host Stephen Colbert remarked, while others invoked Marie Antoinette and Caligula.","US military stores are now selling Trump-branded wines, according to a Forbes report.

Rama Duwaji, the 28-year-old artist who will become New York’s youngest first lady when Zohran Mamdani takes office in January, has spent years expressing fierce political views through her art.Duwaji kept a low public profile during Mamdani’s campaign. However, her illustrations and posts reveal firm positions on American foreign policy and Israel’s actions in Gaza, which is not liked by conservatives and MAGA activists who consider them propaganda.In mid-October, she posted four broken heart emojis with a photo of Saleh Al-Jafarawi on her Instagram story. Jafarawi was described as a pro-Hamas activist by Israel, and he was killed in Gaza by an anti-Hamas militia on October 12. “Beloved Jafarawi,” her post read.Her online work shows repeated condemnation of US and its relationship with Israel. One 2024 illustration features towering stacks of cash labelled “Israeli war crimes”. Mamdani commented under it, writing, “New York charities send over 60 million dollars every year to fund Israeli war crimes, and that number is only growing.”He urged supporters to lobby officials to end donations.In a 2020 piece showing two women and children beneath smoke from a distant aircraft, the caption states, “Presidents come and go, but American imperialism never changes.”Another animation from May depicts starving Palestinians with the words “Not a hunger crisis” before ending on the phrase, “It is deliberate starvation.”Duwaji’s path to New York was shaped by her Syrian-American family. Her mother, Dr Bariah Dardari, trained and worked as a paediatrician in New Jersey before taking leadership roles in hospitals across the UAE. She has also joined humanitarian missions to Syria and Gaza through the Syrian American Medical Society. Duwaji grew up in Texas and New Jersey before the family relocated to Dubai in 2006, reports the New York Post.Though quiet during the campaign, she reportedly helped shape Mamdani’s image and messaging. Fashion outlets have praised her style, with friends comparing her to “our modern-day Princess Diana”.Her work has appeared in the New Yorker and BBC.

Jeans controversy







Sydney Sweeney’s recent interview with GQ has once again stirred up a row around the American Eagle denim campaign that earlier sparked one of the year’s biggest culture-war arguments.The advert was built around the tagline that “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans."" The ad drew accusations of racism and eugenics in June. Her latest remarks have now reignited that row.The interview was conducted by Katherine Stoeffel. It includes several clips of Sweeney addressing the controversy for the first time. Her answer to a direct question about the row went viral on social media, where backlash was quite evident.Stoeffel had asked her to respond to concerns that “specifically in this political climate, white people shouldn’t joke about genetic superiority,” explaining that this was the main criticism of the campaign. Sweeney replied, “I think that when I have an issue that I want to speak about, people will hear.”She also said the advert “spoke for itself,” and described the public reaction from US President Donald Trump and vice president JD Vance as “surreal.”Netizens said the interview was a moment for her to directly address racial concerns or condemn racist interpretations. Instead, her short answer made people think she was dodging the question. Others argued she had no obligation to elaborate further.The discussion once again split along political lines, with liberals attacking both the campaign and her response, and MAGA supporters praising her for not engaging with ""bad-faith"" criticism.Social media also turned its attention to journalist Katherine Stoeffel, accusing her of not asking the right questions. Some users said she was too passive and had “no backbone.” Others criticised her for being too shy and not pressing Sweeney on issues like the racial impact of the advert or Sweeney’s perceived ties to the MAGA movement.The backlash began in June when American Eagle released its “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans” advert. The brand saw the advert a playful pun, but it quickly turned into an online argument. Many critics said the wording sounded too close to ideas about eugenics and “genetic superiority,” especially because Sweeney is often framed as the typical blonde, blue-eyed American actress. The debate went viral on social media, while others argued the outrage was unnecessary and that it was only a joke about jeans.","Sydney Sweeney’s recent interview with GQ has once again stirred up a row around the American Eagle denim campaign.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: A day after peace talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan in Turkey broke down, the Taliban on Saturday accused “elements within the Pakistani military” of pursuing “anti-Afghanistan policies for years. ”“Unfortunately, certain military elements in Pakistan appear to view a stable and strong Afghanistan as contrary to their interests,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement on X. “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts.”Mujahid also rejected claims that the rise of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was linked to the Taliban’s return to power in Kabul. “Some groups have falsely accused the Islamic Emirate, suggesting that instability in Pakistan and the TTP’s growth began with our arrival. In reality, both date back to 2002, a result of misguided policies by certain Pakistani military elements who aligned with the US, permitted drone strikes in Waziristan, and turned against their own people,” he wrote.He pointed to a series of Pakistani military campaigns against the TTP — including Operations Al-Mizan, Rah-e-Rast, Sher Dil, Nijat, Koh-e-Safid, and Zarb-e-Azb — that, he said, displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians.“In this so-called war on terror, 80,000–90,000 soldiers and civilians were killed, by Islamabad’s own count, long before the Islamic Emirate’s rise,” Mujahid added.Calling Pakistan’s instability “an internal issue,” Mujahid remarked the Taliban has taken steps to prevent cross-border militancy since taking power. These include mediating dialogue among political and religious figures, relocating refugees from the Durand Line, banning weapons among refugee populations, and issuing fatwas against unauthorized foreign jihad.“The Islamic Emirate welcomes all efforts that allow refugees to return safely,” he stated, reaffirming that Afghanistan would not allow its territory to be used to interfere in another country’s affairs.","The Taliban accused “elements within the Pakistani military’ of pursuing “anti- Afghanistan policies for years” “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125186693,imgsize-78016,width-400,resizemode-4/taliban-accuses-pakistani-military-of-fueling-instability-through-quotmanufactured-pretextsquot.jpg"
‘Knew F-16s could deliver nukes’: Ex-CIA officer makes major claim on Pakistan; recalls warning of ‘enemy within’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/knew-f-16s-could-deliver-nukes-ex-cia-officer-makes-major-claim-on-pakistan-recalls-warning-of-enemy-within/articleshow/125181155.cms,"Representative image

CIA Whistleblower Confirms Pakistan’s F-16s Were Nuke-Capable, But US Hid The Truth From The World

‘Benazir was cut out of the loop’

A cover-up?





In a startling revelation, former CIA counterproliferation officer Richard Barlow has claimed that successive US Presidents continued to certify Pakistan as a non-nuclear state until 1989 — even though Washington’s own intelligence showed that US-supplied F-16 fighter jets had been modified to deliver nuclear weapons.Barlow, who tracked Pakistan’s clandestine nuclear program through the 1980s, said US officials were fully aware of Islamabad’s nuclear capabilities. “We knew that the F-16s were capable of delivering the Pakistani nuclear weapons as they existed at that time, without any doubt. It’s a hard engineering question, period. It had been looked at by the engineers and the physicists, not by me. There was that. Yet the government went ahead with the sale,” Barlow said in an interview with ANI.He added that the Reagan and Bush administrations kept certifying that Pakistan did not possess nuclear weapons “all the way through 1989,” even as CIA assessments contradicted those claims. “The President continued to certify that Pakistan did not possess nuclear weapons all the way through 1989. Now, I mean, I can tell you that most of us in the CIA are not comfortable with that, to say the least. But we’re not elected officials,” Barlow said.“All we can do is provide the elected officials and senior policymakers with the best available intelligence information, which is accurate, and brief them accordingly. What they do after that is not our place; we’re not in control of that.”Barlow said the US intelligence community had long concluded that Pakistan’s F-16 fleet could deliver nuclear weapons, a finding later echoed in journalist Seymour Hersh’s 1993 article in The New Yorker. “You can read all about it in Seymour Hersh’s article in The New Yorker in 1993. They saw the intelligence community saw nuclear weapons moving to air bases and being put on F-16s, et cetera. You know, so the nuclear weapons that Pakistan did not possess, according to the President of the United States, were actually being stuck on,” Barlow said.The revelations trace back to the 1987 “Brass Tacks” crisis, when Pakistani scientist Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan openly hinted at a nuclear deterrent amid heightened tensions with India. Barlow noted that the US technical experts had already verified Pakistan’s nuclear capability at that time.“To put it in a nutshell, there had been studies for years inside the intelligence community by experts, like national laboratories, etc. We knew all about the Pakistani nuclear weapons design, and we knew all about the F-16s, as you could imagine,” he said.According to Barlow, then Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had limited control over Pakistan’s nuclear program, which was effectively managed by General Mirza Aslam Beg and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan. The US, he said, only confronted Islamabad over the issue after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989.The US had kept the matter quiet during the Afghan war to secure Pakistan’s cooperation against the Soviet Union — a Cold War priority that overshadowed nuclear proliferation concerns.Additionally, talking about past India-Pakistan tensions, Barlow said that by 1990, tensions between India and Pakistan over the nuclear issue had reached alarming levels. The crisis was ultimately defused after then Defense Secretary Robert Gates was sent to New Delhi and Islamabad by President George HW Bush.He added that the 1990 standoff was “far more dangerous” than more recent India-Pakistan flare-ups due to poor command structures and limited communication. “There was a significantly greater chance of miscalculation in 1990 and miscommunication, among other issues. So I think that was a far more dangerous period,” he said.Barlow also discussed the Pressler Amendment, a 1985 US law requiring the President to certify annually that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear device to receive military aid.“After the 1990 nuclear crisis, my bosses at the agency refused to go along with any more certifications. Believe it or not, there were still people in the US government who wanted to certify under the Pressler Amendment,” he said. “They were having a collective heart attack because they knew it was over — the aid, et cetera.”Barlow also claimed that senior US State Department officials secretly tipped off Islamabad about an undercover American operation in the 1980s to arrest a retired Pakistani general involved in nuclear smuggling. The joint CIA–Customs sting had targeted Pakistani agent Arshad Parvez, who was attempting to purchase 25 metric tons of Maraging 350 steel — a key material for uranium enrichment — under the direction of Brigadier General Inam-ul-Haq. “He was supposed to show up in Pennsylvania... but Haq didn’t show up. And I learned that some people in the State Department had tipped off the Pakistani government to this arrest warrantBarlow said he was furious upon learning that officials within his own government had sabotaged the operation, describing his reaction as “ballistic.” The revelation, he said, pointed to how elements within Washington prioritized Pakistan’s cooperation in the Afghan war over enforcing non-proliferation laws. “These were people in my own government, the enemy within,” Barlow remarked, adding that such internal compromises weakened US efforts to curb Pakistan’s nuclear build-up during the 1980s.",Former CIA counterproliferation officer Richard Barlow has claimed that successive US Presidents continued to certify Pakistan as a non-nuclear state until 1989.
