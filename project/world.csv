'Cops planted evidence': SC acquits death row convict after a decade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cops-planted-evidence-sc-acquits-death-row-convict-after-a-decade/articleshow/120077459.cms,"There is no semblance of satisfactory evidence: Court

NEW DELHI: A botched investigation by police, which also ""planted"" evidence, and lopsided proceedings by the trial court sent a man to the gallows in a rape-cum murder case of a child in Uttarakhand. After a decade in jail under the shadow of death, Supreme Court not only quashed his sentence but also acquitted him.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta, after examining all evidence, including the forensic report, did not find even a single piece of credible evidence against the man and pulled up the state police as well as the trial court for the way in which the investigation and prosecution were carried out. The court quashed his conviction by both the trial court as well as high court.The incident occurred in Udham Singh Nagar district in June 2016 when the girl disappeared during a jagran and her body was found in a nearby field. The man was arrested a day later. The bench said when the FIR was lodged, none of the witnesses claimed to have seen the girl with the man, who was in charge of sound and light at the jagran, but they subsequently alleged so when police made him an accused.It also said the doctor who examined the girl was not cross-examined and he also did not disclose the name of the policeman to whom the samples were handed over nor did he state that the samples were sealed and were handed over in a secure condition. The court said police tried to stick the case on the man by getting his confessional statement.""After being arrested, the appellant confessed to the crime and stated that the clothes which he was wearing at the time of commission of the offence were placed by him in a bag which he was carrying in his hand. He had also stated that he was intending to throw the clothes but before he could do so, he was caught by police. We feel that the theory put forward in the testimony of the said witness... is totally unbelievable. It is clear as daylight that these recoveries have been planted because it is hard, if not impossible, to believe that the appellant, who was a free bird and had ample opportunity to destroy the clothes, would keep the same with him for almost two days after the incident so as to facilitate police to recover the same at a later point of time,"" the bench said.It said there was not even a ""semblance of evidence"" on record to satisfy the court that the samples collected from the girl's body and those collected from the man, which were later forwarded to the forensic science lab, were properly sealed or remained in a safe condition. ""There is every possibility of the samples being tampered/manipulated by the police officers to achieve a favourable result from FSL, thereby, inculpating the appellant in the crime,"" it added.The bench also found fault with trial proceedings as the accused was not properly represented. ""Thus, it is established beyond doubt that the trial was not conducted in a fair manner,"" it said.""The lopsided manner in which trial was conducted is fortified from the evidence of sub-inspector Prahlad Singh who was allowed to narrate the entire confession of the appellant in his examination-in-chief. This procedure adopted by the trial court in permitting a police officer to verbatim narrate the confession made by an accused during investigation is grossly illegal,"" tt said.","Supreme Court quashes a man's conviction in a rape-cum-murder case in Uttarakhand.

NEW DELHI: Indian national Nikhil Gupta, indicted by US authorities for plotting to kill Sikh separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun , will go on trial November 3 this year and not in June or July as was earlier proposed.A US district judge of the Southern District of New York finalised the date for the trial, which will last only for a week, after both prosecution and defence sought postponement of the trial to allow them to file pretrial motions to resolve legal issues that may have a bearing on the trial.In a February 28 order, the Court had asked both parties to suggest a trial date in June or July. While the parties also said in their latest submission they anticipated the trial to last for approximately 2 weeks, the court allowed only a week to wrap up the trial. Gupta, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, has been held in a detention centre since the Czech Republic, where he was first detained, extradited him to the US on June 14 last year.Gupta stands accused of hiring a hitman for $ 100 thousand to eliminate Pannun, a dual US-Canadian national, all at the behest of an Indian government official identified as Vikash Yadav. The murder plot unravelled as the hitman turned out to be a federal undercover agent. Yadav allegedly hired Gupta in May 2023 to orchestrate the assassination of Pannun.According to the Department of Justice, Gupta is charged with murder-for-hire and conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and, if convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for each charge. 264The Trump administration has not been reported yet to have raised the murder-for-hire plot bilaterally with Indian authorities but the Biden government placed it right on top of its agenda with India, as it raised the issue at the highest level with the Indian government and pressured it to act against the Indian mastermind.The Indian government formed a high-level committee in November 2023 to probe the US findings. In January this year, days before Trump assumed office, the committee submitted a report recommending legal action against Yadav (without naming him) saying his “earlier criminal links and antecedents also came to notice during the enquiry”.","Indian national Nikhil Gupta, indicted by US authorities for plotting to kill Sikh separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, will go on trial November 3.

He urged J&K govt to take positive steps for compassionate appointment of 12-year-old Yuvraj Singh, son of selection grade constable Jaswant Singh who lost his life in the line of duty, when he attains adulthood.Earlier in the day, Shah flew to BSF outpost ‘Vinay’ near the International Border in the Hiranagar sector of Kathua, where BSF director general Daljit Singh Chaudhary, J&K DGP Nalin Prabhat and other senior officers received him. The outpost is named after assistant commandant Vinay Prasad, who was hit by a sniper shot when he and his patrol party were out on a border domination exercise along the International Border on Jan 15, 2019.Shah’s visit comes at a time when security forces have been engaged in an intensive operation in Kathua over the past fortnight against a group of terrorists that is believed to have recently infiltrated from across the border.Shah also inaugurated newly built facilities at the border, including eight women barracks and high-mast lights.Praising the border guarding force’s glorious history, he said: “The entire nation knows that the BSF is our first line of defence, and the force has always performed this responsibility exceptionally well… In every war with Pakistan, the contribution of our BSF soldiers has been as significant as that of the Army.”On Monday evening, Shah, accompanied by LG Manoj Sinha, landed at the Srinagar airport, where CM Omar Abdullah received him. Shah visited the family of DSP Humayun Bhat, 32, one of four officers killed in an encounter with terrorists in south Kashmir’s Kokernag on Sept 13, 2023.In view of Shah’s visit, tight security arrangements are in place across the Kashmir Valley. The home minister will chair a security review meeting on Tuesday morning at the Raj Bhawan, followed by another meeting on developmental projects.Earlier, after arriving in Jammu on Sunday evening, Shah had held a nearly two-hour long meeting with BJP MLAs.",Home minister Amit Shah is on a three-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir.

Second extension for China's TikTok app

Trump Tariffs hurt TikTok deal . The US President Donald Trump just admitted the same. According to a report in Bloomberg, The US President made the admission to reporters on Air Force One as he returned to Washington after a weekend of golf in Florida. China’s objections to new US tariffs stalled a deal to sell off TikTok and keep it operating in the US, President Donald Trump said, as per the report. Trump told reporters, “We had a deal pretty much for TikTok — not a deal but pretty close — and then China changed the deal because of tariffs.”He added, “If I gave a little cut in tariffs they would have approved that deal in 15 minutes, which shows the power of tariffs.” Reports claim that before Trump announced widespread tariffs that went live on April 5, a deal was said to be close, advanced by a consortium of US investors including Oracle Corp, Blackstone Inc and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.Incidentally, Trump had earlier said that he is willing to cut a deal with China to lower tariffs if the country agreed to a TikTok sale .On Friday, April 4, the US President extended the deadline for the TikTok deal by another 75 days. This is the second extension for the Chinese social media app, after Donald Trump earlier gave a 75-day extension on the day of his inauguration as the US President. Media reports suggest that the Trump administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, have been working on an agreement to find TikTok an American buyer, as required by a bipartisan law enacted in 2024. However, any deal that allows TikTok to be sold to an American company requires China's approval. Under the 2024 law, ByteDance was required to divest TikTok’s US unit by January 19, which has been valued from $20 billion to as high as $150 billion.Trump previously extended the divest-or-ban requirement, and on Friday signed another 75-day extension.","China's objections to new US tariffs stalled a deal to sell off TikTok and keep it operating in the US.

Poll Do you think green card holders should reconsider traveling abroad in light of recent immigration policies? No, I believe it's safe. Yes, it's too risky.

Having correct documents is most important

Green card holders and visa holders in the country need to think twice before traveling outside the country, lawyers warn amid the massive crackdown on international students and migrants. ""Anyone who isn't a U.S. citizen should think hard about the need to leave the United States, especially if they have made statements on social media that are critical of political positions that the Trump administration supports or have had even minimal contact with police,"" César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, the Gregory Williams Chair in civil rights & civil liberties at Ohio State University College of Law, told Newsweek.""The Trump administration has given permanent residents and visa holders plenty of reason to worry about running into problems trying to get back into the United States from a trip abroad,"" the immigration law expert said, though the administration asserted that those who have not broken any laws have nothing to fear about anything.Shannon Shepherd, chair of the media committee for the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) told Newsweek that overall there's no guarantee that a person coming back to the US will be granted entry and that's been the case always. ""But what we're seeing lately is more negative exercise of discretion, I guess is the way to put it, where people are being denied entry that we wouldn't necessarily have been denied before or people being detained instead of just allowed to withdraw their request for entry.""According to these experts, having the correct documentation is of utmost importance. For green card holders, the documents are a valid passport and the green card. If the green card is up for renewal, then one must vatty the receipt from the US Citizenship and Immigration Service.Past criminal convictions, even minor infractions, could now be taken into account at the discretion of CBP officers at the border, along with social media comments or text messages, in order to deny entry even if the traveler has all the correct paperwork, Shepherd said.If an individual is in the process of applying for a green card, known as Adjustment of Status (AoS), then they generally can't leave the country without Advance Parole. This is a travel document that has to be granted by USCIS before travel. CBP website mentions that those with valid H-1B or L-1 visas going through AoS are allowed to travel without Advance Parole, as are V- and K-3/4 nonimmigrant visa holders.","Green card holders and visa holders in the country need to think twice before traveling outside the country, lawyers warn.

Bailable warrant re-issued against Malaika Arora for skipping court in 2012 assault case against Saif Ali Khan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bailable-warrant-reissued-against-malaika-arora-for-skipping-court-in-2012-assault-case-against-saif-ali-khan/articleshow/120081989.cms,"A Mumbai magistrate court has reissued a bailable warrant against Malaika Arora for failing to appear as a witness in the 2012 assault case involving Saif Ali Khan and others.

MUMBAI: A magistrate’s court on Monday reissued a bailable warrant of Rs 5,000 against actor and model Malaika Arora for failing to appear as a witness in the 2012 assault case against actor Saif Ali Khan, her brother-in-law Shakeel Ladak, and Bilal Amrohi. The matter was adjourned to April 29.On March 29, Malaika’s sister, actress Amrita Arora Ladakh, deposing as the third witness, told the court said she saw Saif Ali Khan being punched and hit by the same man who barged into their private enclosure at a Colaba five-star hotel's restaurant and aggressively reprimanded the group for allegedly being loud.The trial commenced last year. Malaika Arora, is listed as a witness as she was also present with the group that dined at the restaurant on February 21, 2012. Amrita (46) had said that a group comprising Khan, Shakeel, Amrohi, Khan's wife and actor Kareena Kapoor Khan, actor Karisma Kapoor, Malaika, designer Vikram Phadnis, and others decided to dine at the restaurant.The case is registered at Colaba police station. Explaining the alleged trigger for the spat at a five-star hotel in Colaba, police said a man from South Africa, Iqbal Sharma, protested against the raucous chatter of the actor's group when Saif Ali Khan allegedly threatened him and his father-in-law Ramanbhai Patel and went on to punch Sharma on the nose, fracturing it.In 2014, a magistrate's court framed charges of assault against Saif Ali Khan, Shakeel, and Amrohi. The trio was charged under sections 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. Subsequently, a plea was moved by the prosecution, submitting that the police report and the statement of the witnesses, Patel and his daughter Tarina Sharma, showed that the former was also assaulted by Khan and his two friends but unfortunately the actor's name was not mentioned as one of the persons who assaulted him.On March 4, 2017, the magistrate's court added the charge, saying, ""...that you accused on the abovementioned date, time and place, in furtherance of your common intention, voluntarily caused hurt to the witness, Ramanbhai Patel, by slapping on his cheek and as well as beating him, and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323.""Khan then moved the sessions court against the order. In his plea, he said when the evidence of the complainant (Sharma) was recorded in 2017, the prosecution moved a plea to modify the charge against him and the two others on the grounds that his name was inadvertently left out when charges were framed with respect to Patel's assault.The actor claimed that the prosecution moved the plea as Sharma, a non-resident Indian, was not attending the matter and they wanted Patel to be the main witness. In 2019, the sessions court rejected his plea.In 2023, a magistrate's court framed an additional charge of voluntarily causing hurt to a witness against the actor, paving the way for it to begin the trial. The accused pleaded not guilty to the charges.","A magistrate’s court on Monday reissued a bailable warrant of Rs 5,000 against actor and model Malaika Arora for failing to appear as a witness in the 2012 assault case.

Harvard University announced plans to borrow up to $750 million through taxable bonds as part of its contingency planning after the federal government said it was reviewing around $9 billion in grants and contracts awarded to it, following allegations of antisemitism on campus.In a statement issued Saturday, Harvard said, “As part of ongoing contingency planning for a range of financial circumstances, Harvard is evaluating resources needed to advance its academic and research priorities.” A university spokesperson clarified that the funds would be used for “general corporate purposes,” reported Straits Times.The announcement follows a similar move by Princeton University, which last week said it was considering selling around $320 million in taxable bonds. Princeton has also seen dozens of its federal research grants frozen by the government.Federal agencies, including the departments of education and health and human services, are examining $255.6 million in existing contracts and $8.7 billion in future grants tied to Harvard and its affiliates. Secretary of education Linda McMahon said the university must address concerns about antisemitic discrimination on campus, or risk further reputational and financial damage.University president Alan Garber warned freezing or cancelling funding would seriously affect life-saving research and scientific innovation.Harvard, which currently has $7.1 billion in debt, expects that amount to rise to $8.2 billion after the bond issuance. The university’s endowment stands at $53 billion—the largest of any US university.Meanwhile, student visas for three of the university's students and two recent graduates were also revoked. The university said it has referred the cases to its legal counsel. The reason for the action is not known.""We are not aware of the details of the revocations or the reasons for them, but we understand that comparable numbers of students and scholars in institutions across the country have experienced similar status changes in roughly the same timeframe,"" Harvard said.","Harvard University announced plans to borrow up to $750 million through taxable bonds as part of its contingency planning.

US president Donald Trump and Paramount, the parent company of CBS News, will soon begin mediation in a $20 billion lawsuit Trump has filed over what he calls “news distortion,” reported New York Times.The case focuses on CBS’s editing of an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris that aired on its flagship programme 60 Minutes.Trump claims the network altered Harris’s comments about Israel to make her look more coherent and polished than she actually was during the interview. He alleges that the edits misled the public and gave Harris an unfair advantage in how she was portrayed.CBS denied the accusations saying the interview was edited to fit broadcast time limits and that it had no intent to deceive viewers. In its defence, CBS pointed to its sister programme, Face the Nation, which had aired a longer version of Harris’s comments. This, the network argues, proves there was no effort to hide or distort her words.The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) initially dismissed the complaint due to lack of evidence. But after Trump appointed Brendan Carr as the new FCC Chairman, the commission reopened the case and ordered CBS to submit the full, unedited footage.CBS’s parent company Paramount is currently in talks to merge with Skydance, a Hollywood studio backed by billionaire Larry Ellison. Some believe resolving the lawsuit could help clear regulatory hurdles for the merger.This isn’t the first time Trump has taken legal action against media outlets. In recent months, ABC News reportedly paid $15 million to settle a defamation claim, and Meta paid $25 million over issues related to Trump’s social media bans.","The case focuses on CBS’s editing of an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris that aired on its flagship programme 60 Minutes.

TEL AVIV: Israel has dramatically expanded its footprint in Gaza Strip since relaunching its war against Hamas last month. It now controls more than 50% of the territory and is squeezing Palestinians into shrinking wedges of land.The largest contiguous area the army controls is around the Gaza border, where the military has razed Palestinian homes, farmland and infrastructure to the point of uninhabitability, according to Israeli soldiers and rights groups. This buffer zone has doubled in size in recent weeks.Israel has depicted its tightening grip as a temporary necessity to pressure Hamas into releasing remaining hostages taken during the Oct 7, 2023, attack that started the war. But the land Israel holds, which includes a corridor that divides the territory's north from south, could be used for wielding long-term control, rights groups say.

ISLAMABAD: A tense standoff unfolded across Balochistan on Monday as a shutter-down strike and widespread road blockades sparked by nationalist leader Sardar Akhtar Mengal ’s call for a “long march” from Lakpass to Quetta paralysed the Pakistani province.The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists, including women leaders of Balochistan Yakjehti Committee (BYC), amid escalating clashes with authorities.Shops businesses and schools remained closed in cities like Quetta, Kalat, Mastung Khuzdar, and Gwadar. Mengal’s supporters blocked key highways, including the Quetta-Karachi national highway.The provincial govt’s deployment of containers, trenches, and police checkpoints at Lakpass, roughly 30 km from Quetta, stalled the march, forcing demonstrators onto rugged mountain routes.Reports of police using teargas and shelling BNP-M workers have intensified the unrest.Mengal, addressing a sit-in at Lakpass, accused the state of oppression and vowed to press forward. “The state may crush us, but we won’t bow,” he declared, signalling plans to escalate the march into province-wide resistance. The protest began March 28 in Wadh, Mengal’s hometown, following the arrest of BYC leaders, including Mahrang Baloch, during a crackdown on their Quetta sit-in. A suicide bombing near the rally on March 29 left Mengal unharmed but underscored the volatile stakes.Balochistan’s govt, led by chief minister Sarfraz Bugti, has taken a hard line. His spokesperson, Shahid Rind, warned Mengal of arrest under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Act if the march entered Quetta’s Red Zone.Negotiations have faltered, with Mengal dismissing the provincial govt’s delegations as powerless to meet demands. BYC, however, rallied behind Mengal, urging highway blockades and strikes to amplify pressure.Analysts see it as a critical juncture for Balochistan, where grievances over state repression, enforced disappearances and resource exploitation fuel dissent. The shutter-down has disrupted public life, with Quetta’s land links to 12 districts severed for over a week. With cellular networks down and security tightened, the province braces for what Mengal’s supporters call a defining fight.",The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) demands the release of detained Baloch activists.

Who is Shoshana Chatfield? US navy officer fired for 'woke' comments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-shoshana-chatfield-us-navy-officer-fired-for-woke-comments/articleshow/120079059.cms,"AP photo

Who is Shoshana Chatfield?

Chatfield is a US navy pilot and bronze star recipient.

She is a native of Garden Grove, California.

She has served in key roles in Afghanistan, the Pacific, and Europe.

She holds degrees from Boston University, Harvard, and the University of San Diego.

She is the only woman serving on Nato’s top military committee.

Chatfield was reportedly targeted by the conservative American Accountability Foundation, which urged her removal, citing her support for a 2015 Women’s Equality Day event and diversity summits in a LinkedIn post.

Vice admiral Shoshana Chatfield, has been dismissed by the Trump administration , US officials confirmed on Monday. Though no clear reason was given, news agency Associated Press sources said her removal appears to be linked to her public support for diversity within the military ranks.According to officials, Chatfield received a phone call from admiral Christopher Grady, the acting chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. She was told the administration wanted to take the position in a “different direction.” Defence secretary Pete Hegseth is believed to have made the decision last week, though it is not clear if president Trump was directly involved. The officials spoke anonymously due to the sensitivity of the matter.This is the third removal of a high-ranking female officer under Trump. In February, Hegseth fired admiral Lisa Franchetti, the then-chief of naval operations. Admiral Linda Fagan, commandant of the coast guard, was dismissed a day after Trump returned to office.The firings are part of a broader effort to eliminate what Trump and Hegseth describe as ""woke"" policies in the military. They have been vocal about dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes.Senator Mark Warner called the firing “deeply disturbing,” criticising Trump for undermining US alliances and removing ""decorated"" officers.","Vice admiral Shoshana Chatfield has been dismissed by the Trump administration.

Senate Republicans pass budget bill as Trump's tariffs spark nationwide protests

US president Donald Trump on Monday declared full support for the Senate’s newly approved budget plan.Posting on Truth Social, Trump wrote that the bill includes “all the elements we need”—from permanent tax cuts to major spending reductions and border security.""The budget plan just passed by the United States Senate has my complete and total endorsement and support. All of the elements we need to secure the border, enact historic spending cuts, and make tax cuts permanent, and much more, are strongly covered and represented in the bill. Thank you to Senate majority leader John Thune, and house speaker Mike Johnson for their hard work and attention to detail. There is no better time than now to get this deal done,” the president wrote in his post.""""The House, the Senate, and our great administration are going to work tirelessly on creating “the one, big, beautiful bill,” an appropriate name if Congress so likes. Everyone is going to be happy with the result. Passage will make even the subject of world trade far easier and better for the USA. The House must pass this budget resolution, and quickly — make America great again!"" the president added.The Senate passed the bill early Saturday in a close 51-48 vote, mostly along party lines. The plan aims to extend the 2017 Trump-era tax cuts, reduce federal spending, and allocate $175 billion each to military funding and immigration enforcement.Democrats strongly opposed the Senate bill. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called Trump’s policies “a disaster” and warned the current proposal would harm social programmes like social security and Medicaid. Republican leaders argued that the bill is necessary to prevent upcoming tax increases, as many of Trump’s tax cuts are set to expire soon.The package sets up a clear political fight in the House, where more conservative Republicans are pushing deeper tax cuts and heavier spending cuts. Fiscal conservatives in the house have already criticised the Senate’s estimates, claiming they downplay the real cost.House speaker Mike Johnson is expected to bring the bill to a vote soon, hoping to strike a deal before the Memorial Day deadline.","US president Donald Trump declared full support for the Senate’s newly approved budget plan.

Canada has again updated its travel advisory for the United States, including a warning to prospective travelers that they should be prepared for scrutiny from border patrol officers. The updated advisory says US authorities can check electronic devices like phones and laptops. ""Comply and be forthcoming in all interactions with border authorities.

The first came as the US made it mandatory for all Canadians staying in the US for more than 30 days to register with the US administration.

The law requires “all aliens 14 years of age or older who were not registered and fingerprinted (if required) when applying for a US visa and who remain in the United States for 30 days or longer” to do so, according to the USCIS website. Parents and legal guardians of children under 14 must make sure they are registered.Canada issued a warning about the stricter border checks before the new rule took effect.""Individual border agents often have significant discretion in making those determinations.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney marked the beginning of Ram Navami celebrations by joining the Hindu community at the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Toronto.Observed over nine days, Ram Navami— also known as Ram Navratri — concludes the Navratri festival, which honors Goddess Durga and her nine divine forms, collectively known as Navdurga. The final day commemorates the birth of Lord Ram, one of Hinduism’s most revered deities.Sharing his experience on X, Carney posted, ""Joined Hindu community members at the @BAPS_Toronto Mandir yesterday for the first day of Ram Navami celebrations.

Despite being among the highest earners and leading successful lives, they maintain a low profile and often refrain from engaging in political decisions. This sometimes leads to underrepresentation, leaving the community vulnerable.""The Foundation also addressed the recent rise in anti-Hindu sentiment, attributing it to separatist influences. It urged the incoming federal administration to take meaningful action. ""The recent surge in anti-Hindu sentiment, fueled by rising separatist groups, has deeply affected every Hindu Canadian.

Poll Should the government reconsider its use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations? No, it's necessary for national security. Yes, it's outdated.

Andry Hernandez Romero , a Venezuelan makeup artist and member of the LGBTQ+ community, came to the United States last year seeking asylum after facing threats in his home country due to his sexuality and political beliefs. After a treacherous journey through the perilous Darien Gap and into Mexico, he legally presented himself at a US border crossing near San Diego and was taken into custody to await the outcome of his asylum application.Romero had passed a credible fear interview—an initial screening in the asylum process—which determined that his claim had merit. “And the government had found that his threats against him were credible and that he had a real probability of winning an asylum claim,” said Lindsay Toczylowski, his attorney.But just weeks ago, Romero vanished from the legal process. ""Our client, who was in the middle of seeking asylum, just disappeared. One day he was there, and the next day we're supposed to have court, and he wasn't brought to court,"" Toczylowski added.Romero is among 238 Venezuelan migrants transferred to El Salvador's high-security Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) under a new deportation agreement between the Trump administration and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele. President Trump, who has vowed to dismantle the Venezuelan criminal organization Tren de Aragua, utilized the Alien Enemies Act—unused since WWII—to justify the deportations, branding the individuals as terrorists and gang members.Since being flown to El Salvador, Romero’s legal team and loved ones have been unable to contact him. Images captured by Time magazine photographer Philip Holsinger show Romero inside CECOT. Holsinger recalled hearing a man cry out, ""I'm not a gang member. I'm gay. I'm a stylist,"" before being slapped and forcibly shaved.""It's horrifying to see someone who we've met and know as a sweet, funny artist, in the most horrible conditions I could imagine,"" said Toczylowski, expressing deep concern for her client's safety. ""We have grave concerns about whether he can survive.""","Andry Hernandez Romero, a Venezuelan makeup artist and member of the LGBTQ+ community, came to the United States last year seeking asylum.

Trump administration wins court approval to fast-track deportations under wartime law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-wins-court-approval-to-fast-track-deportations-under-wartime-law/articleshow/120078092.cms,"US President Donald Trump (ANI photo)

What is the Alien Enemy Act?

The US Supreme Court has given the Trump administration temporary permission to use an 18th-century wartime law to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of gang involvement. In a 5–4 decision, the court allowed the government to enforce the Alien Enemies Act , originally passed in 1798, but insisted that those affected must be granted a court hearing before removal.The ruling, a major victory for the Trump White House, permits immigration officials to fast-track deportations while legal challenges continue in lower courts. However, the court made clear that deportees must be informed they are subject to the act and given a chance to contest their removal.Legal proceedings must now take place in Texas, not Washington, as a federal appeals court had previously decided.The decision exposed deep divisions on the bench. All three liberal justices dissented, accusing the administration of attempting to bypass judicial scrutiny. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, though part of the conservative majority, partially joined the dissent, signalling unease with parts of the ruling.Attorney General Pam Bondi described the court’s ruling as “a landmark victory for the rule of law.” She added, “An activist judge in Washington, DC does not have the jurisdiction to seize control of President Trump’s authority to conduct foreign policy and keep the American people safe,” in a social media post. The ruling stemmed from an order issued by U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg, who blocked deportations to El Salvador.President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to justify deportations under a proclamation targeting the Tren de Aragua gang. The ACLU sued on behalf of five Venezuelan noncitizens detained in Texas, prompting Boasberg’s temporary halt on deportations.The judge later questioned if the administration defied his order. Trump and allies called for Boasberg’s impeachment, though Chief Justice Roberts stated, “impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.”The Alien Enemy Act of 1798 is a wartime law that gives the US President authority to detain or deport nationals of a hostile country during a declared war or in cases of invasion or threat. Still in force today, it was part of the original Alien and Sedition Acts, introduced to address tensions with France. While other related laws were later repealed, the Alien Enemy Act remains intact and has rarely been used in modern times.Under the act, those deemed to be linked to a hostile nation can be subject to restrictions, detention, or removal—typically following a presidential proclamation. The law is rooted in the belief that foreign nationals aligned with an enemy power may pose a security risk and therefore are not entitled to the same protections as US citizens. The recent case involving Venezuelan migrants marks one of the most high-profile uses of the act in recent decades.","The US Supreme Court has given the Trump administration temporary permission to use an 18th-century wartime law to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of gang involvement.

Who are the militant groups?



Poll Do you believe the rise in militant attacks in Pakistan is primarily due to the influence of groups based in Afghanistan? No, not at all Yes, definitely

Which are the most affected regions?



What are the consequences of the rising violence?



More than 100 deadly attacks in Pakistan by Islamist militants and separatist rebels made March the deadliest month over a decade with 335 people killed, a think tank reported Thursday.Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) think tank. They included 73 members of security services, including soldiers and police officers, 67 civilians and 88 militants.The Islamist-militant Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the separatist rebel Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) were the main militant groups responsible for the attacks.The BLA was responsible for a 28-hour hijacking of the train Jaffar Express in the southwestern region Balochistan. Some 450 people were held hostage and more than two dozen were killed.Balochistan was the most affected province, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the northwest of Pakistan.They have both also been targets of suicide bombings, a form of attacks that surged in March.In Punjab, the eastern province bordering India, the think tank observed a strong increase in militant activity.At least seven attacks were recorded, and most were attributed to the TTP.In response to the growing threat, Pakistan's security forces have intensified their operations in the region. Many people have been arrested with connections to militant groups, including the TTP.Islamabad claims that most attacks, both by militants and rebels, are planned and executed from Afghanistan. It accuses the neighboring country of granting Pakistani militants space to plan and organize attacks.A recent report by the United Nations supported this claim. It said that the Taliban provided support to the TTP and that some attacks were launched from Afghan territory.As a consequence, the Pakistani government has urged the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan to act against the allegedly responsible criminals. Kabul, on the other hand, denies that the militants are in Afghanistan.","Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.

Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.The operation, in Katlang, a remote hilltop area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, was aimed at militant hideouts and resulted in the deaths of 12 suspected terrorists. However, it also led to the deaths of 10 civilians, including women and children, sparking outrage.Government spokesman Muhammad Ali Saif confirmed the casualties and said that the location was being used as a hideout and transit point for terrorists. He admitted that unarmed civilians were present at the site.""The safety of civilians is always a top priority during such operations. However, due to complex geography, terrorists using civilian populations as cover, and the urgent nature of the operation, unintended consequences can sometimes occur,"" said Saif, as quoted by the Associated Press.The provincial government has now promised an inquiry into how the operation led to civilian deaths.Local residents reported that the victims were nomads from the Swat region who had been living in the Shamozai mountains with their livestock. Their families protested by placing their bodies on the Swat Highway, demanding justice.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur called the incident “highly condemnable and tragic.” He assured that every effort is made to avoid civilian casualties but acknowledged the challenges of military operations in complex terrains where militants embed themselves among civilians.The government said medical aid is being provided to the injured, and compensation for the victims' families is being arranged. A provincial press note said the operation had ""neutralised several high-value militant targets"" but admitted that the “fog of war” sometimes leads to unintended consequences.","Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.

Demonstrations broke out across Bangladesh, including Dhaka city, on Monday protesting against Israeli actions in Gaza. Different organisations spanning political, social, cultural, religious and professional spheres took to Dhaka's streets in protest.The demonstrations form part of worldwide protests against attacks on Palestinians in Gaza, according to organisers. Students have stayed away from classes and examinations to join the protests.Muhammad Yunus, chief advisor of interim government in Bangladesh, said in a statement on X, ""The Government of Bangladesh expresses its strongest condemnation of the Israeli Occupying Forces’ continued mass killing and gross violations of human rights in the Gaza Strip. Israel’s ongoing military attacks since last month's unilateral breach of the ceasefire have killed scores of Palestinians, mostly women and children as well as blocked the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza leading to a human catastrophe. Evidently, Israel has shown no regard to repeated international appeals and has instead engaged in an increasingly intense killing spree.""Workers and professionals went on strike with organisers asking people to stop buying Israeli products.""We support humanity first of all. The things that Israel has been doing to Palestine to remove their identity from the world are brutally bad. As a human, if I don't support Palestine right now, my humanity will be lost,"" stated a Dhaka University student participant.Protesters voiced strong opposition to American support for Israel's Gaza offensive, whilst criticising the inaction of bodies like the UN, OIC and Arab League.Responding about American involvement, she said, ""They have been doing this for power, nothing else. If they had humanity in their hearts, they would not be doing this to the people right now. We are demanding to stop the genocide and to stop the killing of people.""Palestinian flags, solidarity placards, and setting fire to Netanyahu's effigy were all part of the Bangladeshi protest.The USA faces criticism over Trump's suggested forced Palestinian relocation for Gaza's reconstruction.

Man who fought with Maoists to end monarchy is now commander of people who want it back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/man-who-fought-with-maoists-to-end-monarchy-is-now-commander-of-people-who-want-it-back/articleshow/120066259.cms,"Durga Prasai, the healthcare baron.

Durga Prasai was once a Maoist ally.

KATHMANDU: The man who once smuggled armed Maoists in milk vans through Nepal’s eastern flatlands is now a fugitive “hiding in India” — his black SUV abandoned in a village ditch just 20-odd km from the border. Durga Prasai , the healthcare baron who financed rebels and established hospitals, is now broadcasting his fury from hiding, his voice ringing through TikTok videos, Instagram reels, and bootleg YouTube clips.Two decades ago, he backed a 10-year civil war that killed over 17,000 people and helped bring down the crown. Today, he’s the loudest voice calling for its return. Last month, a coalition of pro-royalist groups declared him their 'People’s Commander' — a symbolic title that capped his rapid rise from political outsider to the most visible face of Nepal’s monarchy revival. Overnight, the Maoist-turned-royalist became the de facto leader of a movement that had long lacked coherence or momentum.Born into a farming family in Terhathum in 1971, his family later migrated to Jhapa. He dropped out after Class 8 due to financial constraints. A failed buffalo-farming venture and mounting debt nudged him into politics. Initially aligning with the Nepali Congress , he later went underground with the Maoists. During the war, he provided refuge and logistics to fighters, becoming a trusted link between revolution and resources. His ties to Maoist supremo Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ deepened, and by 2017, he was influential enough to host a dinner with both Prachanda and PM K P Sharma Oli — helping unify warring factions.Then came the rupture. After being denied a parliamentary ticket and seeing his private medical college, B&C Medical College, embroiled in controversies, Prasai broke with the ruling UML. In 2022, he was expelled from the party. By early 2023, he was publicly denouncing secularism and federalism. The man who once worked to end the monarchy began to call for its restoration.“Prachanda betrayed the people, the revolution, and everything we fought for,” Prasai said recently. “He used the blood of thousands to build a personal empire. He’s the reason the country is where it is today — divided, looted, and leaderless. The politicians are corrupt. The king never looted the country. We want him back.”On March 28, he took that message to the streets. Under the banner of his ‘People’s Movement for Nation, Nationality, Religion and Culture’, Prasai led a massive pro-monarchy rally in central Kathmandu.What started as a peaceful protest devolved into chaos. Videos show Prasai’s SUV breaking through police barricades. Protesters clashed violently with security forces. Two people died. Govt offices were ransacked.By the next morning, Prasai had vanished.On Friday, his SUV was found abandoned in Jhapa, 35km by road from Panitanki, an Indian border town on Nepal’s east. Police suspect he switched vehicles and crossed into India. “He is either in the Tarai or in Indian territory,” a senior police official told myRepublica. “We’re monitoring all points.”But from hiding, Prasai has kept talking. In one video, standing beside a temple, he says: “Even a lion takes a step back before hunting — and then it pounces.” In another: “I am still in Nepal. I have no enmity with the police. I stepped back not out of fear, but to prepare for the next move.” Addressing the events at the March 28 protest, he said: “I broke through the security barricade for my own safety. It was not an act of hostility toward the police. I apologise for any harm caused to you.”He also claimed that snipers had been positioned to assassinate him. “This was not an ordinary operation,” he said. “After hearing that the PM has ordered to shoot me on sight, I took shelter in a safe place.” On Facebook, he dared the authorities: “If you have the courage, arrest me and King Gyanendra within 24 hours. Let’s see who the people stand with.”While Prasai presents himself as a moral insurgent, critics point to a chequered past. In Dec 2024, his case was transferred to the Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police for allegedly paying Rs 500,000 to hire criminal associates to issue threats to business rivals. The threats, investigators say, were made in the name of notorious Indian gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who remains incarcerated at Sabarmati Central Jail in Gujarat. Prasai denied any involvement, claiming the charges were politically motivated.Regardless, his influence has only grown. He has overshadowed traditional monarchist leaders, including those from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), spearheading the protests for years. Thousands now rally behind him, waving flags and amplifying his speeches on social media.Prachanda, leader of the opposition, has warned in parliament that the republic’s democratic gains are “under coordinated attack.” Oli — who replaced him as PM in July 2024 — has also distanced himself from his former ally. Dozens of Prasai’s aides have been arrested since the March 28 protest. A red-corner notice for his arrest is in preparation and there are rumours that he will be charged with sedition.Yet among many frustrated Nepalis, Prasai’s message lands hard. Fourteen govts in 17 years, rising prices, youth emigration, a failing healthcare system — all have left the republic discredited in the eyes of millions. Whether Prasai can ride that sentiment into real political change remains uncertain.","Durga Prasai once smuggled armed Maoists in milk vans through Nepal’s eastern flatlands.

Protect minorities: Modi. Restrain Hasina: Yunus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/protect-minorities-modi-restrain-hasina-yunus/articleshow/119993504.cms,"PM Modi meets Bangladesh's Muhammad Yunus on the sidelines of Bimstec Summit (Picture from X @narendramodi)

B'desh says reports of attacks on minorities 'hugely inflated'

PM Modi on Friday asked Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus to ensure safety and security of minorities, including Hindus, in the country and thoroughly investigate ""atrocities"" committed against them.In their first bilateral meeting since the formation of the interim govt in Dhaka in Aug 2024, Modi sought positive and constructive relationship with Bangladesh based on pragmatism, and urged Yunus to avoid rhetoric that could vitiate the atmosphere.However, as Modi broached the subject of minorities and increasing radicalisation, a Bangladesh readout said, Yunus called for a reality check against what he described as social media propaganda and said ties should be shaped on basis of principles like territorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs.Yunus came to the meeting in Bangkok armed with his own list of issues Dhaka considers important, including the extradition of Sheikh Hasina , border killings, Saarc cooperation and pending Teesta water-sharing agreement. Even in the absence of any assurance that India would consider extraditing the ousted PM, Bangladesh authorities described the meeting as constructive and fruitful, but called upon India to restrain her from making inflammatory statements. Modi touched upon the issue of polls in Bangladesh as he reiterated India's support for a democratic, stable, peaceful, progressive, and inclusive neighbour. According to Bangladesh, Modi said India's ties are with the country and not with a political party or organisation.PM Modi underlined that India believed in a people-centric approach to the relationship and highlighted the cooperation between the two countries over a long period that has delivered tangible benefits to people in both countries,"" said foreign secretary Vikram Misri.According to Misri, the PM spoke at length about the issue of minorities, expressing deep concern over their plight and telling Yunus how violence against them impacts society in India too. He expressed hope Bangladesh would be able to fulfil its responsibility of protecting minority communities.However, the minority issue remained a sticking point as Yunus, according to the Bangladesh readout of the meeting, said the reports of attacks on minorities were hugely inflated and ""the bulk of them were fake news"". He asked Modi to send reporters to Bangladesh to investigate the alleged attacks themselves.""The chief adviser said he has instituted an effective system for monitoring every incident of religious and gender violence in the country, and his govt was taking serious actions to stop any occurrence of such incidents,"" said Dhaka in a statement.While calling for Hasina to be extradited, Yunus also accused the former PM of destabilising Bangladesh through her ""inflammatory"" statements from India, calling it an abuse of the hospitality extended to her by the Indian govt. He also accused Hasina of committing crimes against humanity, citing a UN report about the human rights violations under her govt.""We request that Indian govt take appropriate measures to restrain her from continuing to make such incendiary statements while she remains in your country,"" said Yunus. Interestingly, according to Dhaka, Modi blamed social media for tensions over Hasina's remarks and said India doesn't have special preference for any party or individual.He also said Bangladesh remained thankful for the ""unwavering support"" of the govt and people of India during its most challenging time in 1971. ""Excellency, we seek to work together with you to set the relationship on the right track for the benefit of both our peoples,"" said Yunus, according to Bangladesh.While Yunus raised the issue of border killings, Modi told him strict enforcement of the law and prevention of illegal border crossings, especially at night, are necessary for maintaining border security and stability.

'Unacceptable and deeply concerning': UK minister condemns Israel's detention of British MPs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/unacceptable-and-deeply-concerning-uk-minister-condemns-israels-detention-of-british-mps/articleshow/120073106.cms,"Yuan Yang, MP for Earley and Woodley, and Abtisam Mohamed, MP for Sheffield Central (Photo: X)

The Minister for the Middle East, Hamish Falconer, has condemned the treatment of two British MPs who were detained and refused entry to Israel over the weekend, calling the move “unacceptable” and “deeply concerning” during a statement to the House of Commons.Yuan Yang, MP for Earley and Woodley, and Abtisam Mohamed, MP for Sheffield Central, had both received entry clearance before travelling as part of a parliamentary delegation to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. However, on arrival at Tel Aviv airport, they were held for six hours by Israeli immigration officials. Falconer told MPs, “When I spoke to them at 8.30pm, they believed they were to be detained overnight without their mobile phones.”Following intervention by Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Falconer, the MPs were released from detention but still barred from entering Israel. They were flown back to the UK early on Sunday morning.“It is my understanding that this is the first time a British MP has been barred from entering Israel,” Falconer said. “That decision appears to have been taken on the basis of the comments made in this Chamber.” He continued, “It is no way to treat democratically elected representatives of a close partner nation. We have made this clear at the highest levels in Israel.”Falconer confirmed that Foreign Office officials were involved in assisting the MPs and paid tribute to the pair, who he said “behaved with great dignity”. He added that they had planned to visit humanitarian projects in Gaza and the West Bank to witness the impact of the ongoing conflict and rising settler violence.“These visits are commonplace for MPs from across this House and from all parties,” he said, pointing out that more than 160 MPs have taken part in similar trips, often supported by groups such as Medical Aid for Palestinians and the Council on Arab British Understanding.Falconer warned the Israeli government that barring MPs “will only damage the image of the Israeli government in the eyes of Honourable Members across the House.” He also addressed the wider crisis in Gaza, citing the deaths of 15 paramedics in Rafah on 23 March and reiterated the UK’s call for a ceasefire. “The killing of 15 paramedics and rescue workers… was one of the deadliest attacks on humanitarian staff since the war began,” he said. “These deaths are an outrage and we must see this incident investigated transparently.”“A ceasefire is the only way we will bring the conflict to an end,” he said.","Yuan Yang, MP for Earley and Woodley, and Abtisam Mohamed,MP for Sheffield Central, had both received entry clearance before travelling.

Plans to harm state the reason, embassy says

History of rejected visits

Dozens killed in Gaza, rockets in Israel

Two British members of parliament who were sent back to the UK after trying to enter Israel criticized the country's decision on Sunday.Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang, both from the country's governing center-left Labor Party, traveled to Israel as part of a parliamentary delegation, but were stopped by Israeli authorities due to what the Israeli embassy in Britain labeled as their intention to provoke anti-Israel activities.""We're astounded at the unprecedented step taken by the Israeli authorities to refuse British MPs entry on our trip to visit the occupied West Bank,"" the two said in a statement after returning to London.""It is vital that parliamentarians are able to witness first hand the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory ,"" the statement continued.According to Israel's embassy in London, the two politicians ""had accused Israel of false claims, were actively involved in promoting sanctions against Israeli ministers, and supported campaigns aimed at boycotting the State of Israel,"" whereas Mohamed and Yang said they had spoken about the importance of following international law.The two said parliamentarians should have the ability to ""speak truthfully,"" without having fears of being targeted.Britain's Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the Israeli authorities' handling of the two British MPs was no way to treat parliamentarians.Members of the European Parliament and the US Congress have previously been barred from entering the country on similar grounds, with the latest high-profile name added to the list being UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.Israel said the reason for the decision was that Guterres had not ""unequivocally"" condemned Iran's missile attack on the country.Another high-profile case took place in 2019, when Congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib were prevented from entering Israel due to their history of criticism against the country.Tlaib, who is of Palestinian origin, was later allowed to enter Israel ""on humanitarian grounds"" to visit her grandmother, who lived in the occupied West Bank.Tlaib had to commit to ""not promoting any boycotts against Israel"" during her visit, which she rejected, labeling Israel's conditions ""oppressive.""Meanwhile, Gaza's civil defense agency said that at least 44 people have been killed as a result of Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip on Sunday, with dozens being injured. Israel has ramped up its strikes in Gaza in recent weeks, and accused Hamas of stalling efforts to reach a ceasefire deal to release Israeli hostages.In Israel, several rockets were shot from the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, triggering sirens across the southern cities of Ashdod and Ashkelon. The IDF said most rockets were intercepted.One injury has been reported in the city of Ashkelon as a result of one of the rockets.Hamas took responsibility for the rockets' launch. Hamas is deemed a terrorist organization by not only Israel, but also Germany, the US and several other countries.","Two British members of parliament were sent back to the UK after trying to enter Israel.

UK Nurse Suspended: UK nurse claims she was suspended for ‘misgendering’ trans prisoner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-nurse-claims-she-was-suspended-for-misgendering-trans-prisoner/articleshow/120043967.cms,"File photo: Suspended nurse Jennifer Melle (Picture credit: X)

A senior NHS nurse on Sunday was suspended after addressing a transgender paedophile as ""Mister"" and later speaking publicly about the incident. Jennifer Melle, 40, was escorted from St Helier Hospital in Carshalton, Surrey, in tears following a short meeting with a manager last week, Daily Mail reported.Ms Melle, a devout Christian originally from Uganda, claims she was punished for whistleblowing , despite being subjected to racist abuse by the patient. “I am devastated to have been suspended just for whistleblowing,” she was quoted saying by The Daily Mail.“Despite being the one placed at risk, I am the one being punished. The message I have received is clear: I am expected to tolerate racism, deny biological reality and suppress my deeply held Christian beliefs.”The patient, known only as Patient X, was a convicted sex offender brought to the ward from a high-security men’s prison for treatment. During an evening shift, Ms Melle referred to the patient as “he” and “Mister” while discussing a catheter procedure with a doctor, explaining it was “a medical scenario that required accurate terminology.”The patient, who identifies as a woman, became enraged and verbally assaulted the nurse.According to The Telegraph, Ms Melle recalled the patient shouting, “Imagine if I called you n-----? How about I call you n-----? Yes, black n-----,” before lunging at her.Despite this abuse, it was Ms Melle who was disciplined last year with a final warning and referred to the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). The NHS trust has now suspended her over a “potential breach” of patient confidentiality, after she spoke to the media about her experience.Ms Melle has launched legal proceedings against Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust, alleging harassment, discrimination and human rights violations . The Christian Legal Centre, which is backing her claim, described her treatment as “blatant, unlawful victimisation.”“This is a legally protected act under the Equality Act,” said Andrea Williams, the group’s chief executive. “The NHS has become so entrenched in transgender ideology that it is willing to side with a man brought in from prison in chains – who was shouting racist abuse – over a Christian nurse”, Wiliams added.The case has sparked political backlash. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch called Ms Melle’s suspension “completely crazy,” adding, “She has my full support. It’s time the Government pulls its finger out and intervenes to make it clear no one should be punished at work for stating biological reality to paedophiles.”A spokesperson for the NHS trust said staff are expected to uphold professional standards, including confidentiality, and confirmed Ms Melle’s complaints were under investigation. “There is no excuse for racially abusing our staff, and we’re sorry that Ms Melle had this experience,” the spokesperson was quoted saying by The Telegraph. “As proceedings are still ongoing, it wouldn’t be right for us to comment further”, the spokesperson added.","Jennifer Melle, 40, was escorted from St Helier Hospital in Carshalton, Surrey, in tears following a short meeting with a manager last week.

UK PM Keir Starmer acknowledges Trump’s tariff logic but calls them wrong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-pm-keir-starmer-acknowledges-trumps-tariff-logic-but-calls-them-wrong/articleshow/120034542.cms,"Poll Do you agree with Keir Starmer's stance on tariffs? No, I oppose his view. Yes, I support his view.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to acknowledge the reasoning behind US President Donald Trump’s latest push for tariffs, even as he maintains that such protectionist measures are the wrong approach, according to The Times.In a speech due to be delivered on Sunday, the Labour leader is set to announce that he recognises why Trump's economic nationalism resonates with many voters. However, he will also argue that tariffs ultimately do more harm than good.“Trump has done something that we don’t agree with but there’s a reason why people are behind him on this,” a spokesperson for the Prime Minister told The Times.“The world has changed, globalization is over and we are now in a new era. We’ve got to demonstrate that our approach, a more active Labour government, a more reformist government, can provide the answers for people in every part of this country,” the spokesperson added, quoted by the New York Post.Starmer will also throw light on what he sees as the end of globalisation, saying that free trade and mass migration, once considered cornerstones of modern economic policy, have failed large sections of the voters.Although Starmer has not yet spoken to President Trump about the newly announced tariffs, he did raise the issue with French President Emmanuel Macron during a phone call on Saturday. Both leaders reportedly agreed that a trade war would benefit no one, though “nothing should be off the table,” according to the report.Trump’s sweeping new tariffs, announced on Wednesday, include a 10% levy on all goods imported from the UK, part of a broader strategy targeting almost every country in the world.","UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to acknowledge the reasoning behind US President Donald Trump's latest push for tariffs.
