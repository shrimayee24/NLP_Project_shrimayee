'Working to spread hatred against Muslims': Owaisi slams Assam CM’s ‘point-blank shot’ video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/working-to-spread-hatred-against-muslims-owaisi-slams-assam-cms-point-blank-shot-video/articleshow/128096040.cms,"NEW DELHI: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen ( AIMIM ) chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Sunday launched a broadside against Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma over a video posted by the BJP showing Sarma taking a “point-blank shot” at two individuals identified as minorities.During a rally at Telangana's Zaheerabad, Owaisi accused the Assam chief minister of spreading hate against the Muslim community and added that the AIMIM would soon lodge a police complaint over the video.“If you think that communalism has ended, remember, no matter who comes to power, the poison of communalism persists. And the remedy, the antidote for the poison of communalism, is that you make the representatives of the Majlis successful. You see that in the country, the chief minister of Assam makes a video where he has a gun in his hand. And he fires a bullet. The bullet hits a person wearing a beard and a cap,” Owaisi said.“Tell me, he is the chief minister of Assam from the BJP. He posts a video from the BJP's social media. Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen strongly condemns that video. And Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, God willing, will also file a complaint with the police against it, so that a case can be registered against the chief minister of Assam.They are working to spread religious hatred against Muslims,” he added.Also read | 'I want to give you Rs 2 in alms': Owaisi hits out at Himanta Sarma over 'trouble Miya Muslims' remark This comes after the BJP Assam unit posted a video on X showing Sarma purportedly aiming a rifle at two people, one wearing a skull cap and another with a beard. The video was deleted after receiving backlash.Earlier, Owaisi had slammed Sarma over his controversial remarks on “troubling Miya Muslims”, calling them unconstitutional and divisive.Owaisi mocked the chief minister, saying, “I want to give you Rs 2 as alms,” and accused him of reducing constitutional governance to prejudice and intimidation. In a lengthy response, Owaisi said India’s Constitution guarantees equality and non-discrimination, regardless of religion or community.“The Constitution says all are equal. No discrimination should be done, whether it is a chief minister or anyone else,” he said.Owaisi alleged that Bengali-speaking Muslims in Assam were being scapegoated for issues ranging from migration to rising prices.“If vegetable prices increase in Assam, Miya Muslims are blamed. If someone wants to vote, they are told to go to Bangladesh,” he said, adding that such rhetoric amounted to targeting a community for political gain.The AIMIM leader's remarks came after Sarma made statements encouraging action against “Miya Muslims” in Assam.Sarma said, “Trouble the Miya Muslims by any means. If they face trouble, they will go from Assam... We are directly against the Miya Muslims. We are not hiding anything.”The comments triggered a political storm in the election-bound northeastern state, with opposition parties accusing the BJP of resorting to communal polarisation to consolidate votes.The BJP, however, has long maintained that its focus in Assam is on addressing illegal immigration and protecting indigenous rights. Bengali-speaking Muslims have frequently been labelled “illegal infiltrators” in political discourse, an issue that has remained central to Assam’s electoral politics.",All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen ( AIMIM ) chief Asaduddin Owaisi launched a broadside against Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma over a video posted by the BJP.

‘Have To Stay United’: RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat On Atrocities Against Hindus In Bangladesh

RSS chief must be Hindu, caste not a criterion

Organisation focuses on values, not campaigning

Language and anti-corruption stance

NEW DELHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday said the organisation had asked him to continue working despite completing 75 years of age, adding that he would step down whenever the Sangh directs him to do so.Speaking during an interactive session at an event marking the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ’s centenary, Bhagwat said there is no election for the post of RSS chief and appointments are made by regional and divisional heads.“There is no election to the post of RSS chief. Regional and divisional heads appoint the chief. Generally, it is said that after turning 75, one should work without holding any post,” Bhagwat said.He added that after informing the organisation about turning 75, he was asked to continue.“I have completed 75 years and informed the RSS, but the organisation asked me to continue working. Whenever the RSS asks me to step down, I will do so, but retirement from work will never happen,” he said.Bhagwat said the RSS does not follow community-based representation and that volunteers rise through the ranks based on their work. He asserted that the RSS chief will always be a Hindu, irrespective of caste and the post goes to the best available candidate.“If I were to choose a chief, I would go by the ‘best available candidate’ criterion,” he said, adding that belonging to the Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe communities is not a disqualification, just as being a Brahmin is not a qualification.The RSS chief said the organisation’s work was about inculcating “sanskar” or values, and not campaigning.“Excessive campaigning leads to publicity and then arrogance,” he said, adding that publicity should be measured and timely.In a lighter remark, Bhagwat said the Sangh “extracts work till the last drop of blood from its volunteer” and that there has never been a situation where someone had to be retired.Bhagwat said English would never be the medium of communication for RSS functioning as it is not an Indian language, though it is used where necessary.He also said the RSS works geographically and does not target any caste or community.On corruption, Bhagwat said the RSS supports anyone fighting it. “Our volunteers are told to support those who fight corruption,” he said, adding that corruption lies in people’s minds, not the system.He also urged people to detect and report illegal infiltrators to authorities and said caste-based reservations should continue “as long as needed,” while stressing the need for social unity.","Mohan Bhagwat says there is no election for the post of RSS chief and appointments are made by regional and divisional heads.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has criticised Left politics as a ""retrograde ideology"" which has lost a lot of ground, even as he praised BJP MP from Kerala, C Sadanandan Master's maiden speech in Rajya Sabha, and admired his courage after he lost his legs in a brutal attack by alleged supporters of CPM over three decades ago.Master had put his prosthetic legs on display as he delivered his speech in the House on Feb 2 to highlight the brutality of his CPM rivals, a charge rejected by the party's members.Modi said, ""Your courage is widely known in Kerala and to a lot of us, but when you displayed the artificial limbs that support you, it surprised people in Parliament and across the length and breadth of India. People were unable to digest how in a vibrant democracy like ours, a hardworking teacher could be attacked like this by followers of a retrograde ideology."" He added, ""And today, it is worth noting that the retrograde ideology has shrunk greatly, while you are sitting proudly in Parliament! The manner in which a few MPs were mocking you and questioning your struggles was appalling even by their own dismal standards. "" Modi, however, did not directly mention the Left parties.The PM echoed Sadanandan's anguish over the political situation in poll-bound Kerala, saying people are tired of the Congress-led UDF and CPM-led LDF, two principal rivals in a state where BJP has made some gains but remains a distant third so far.Modi recalled his recent visit to Thiruvananthapuram and said the welcome he got was exceptional. ""The presence of youngsters in particular was gladdening to see. It shows that the people of Kerala are appreciating our vision of Vikasita Keralam. I am sure you are happy that Kerala will benefit significantly from the recently presented budget and its provisions across a wide range of sectors,"" he said.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi has criticised Left politics as a ""retrograde ideology"" He praised BJP MP from Kerala, C Sadanandan Master's maiden speech in Rajya Sabha.

'Why Was My Life Ruined?': Tej Pratap Yadav's Ex-Wife Lashes Out at Lalu, Rabri, Tejashwi Yadav

NEW DELHI: Janshakti Janata Dal (JJD) chief Tej Pratap Yadav on Sunday strongly denied rumours circulating on social media that a woman allegedly linked to him has given birth to his child, calling the claims false and defamatory.He accused political rivals and former associates of deliberately spreading misinformation and said that he would take legal action Addressing a late-evening press conference, former Bihar minister said that the rumours had caused him severe mental distress and were part of a targeted campaign to malign him. He claimed the speculation resurfaced months after a controversy that led to his expulsion from the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), headed by his father Lalu Prasad.“I am distraught at rumours on social media that a woman with whom I had been falsely linked several months ago, which resulted in my expulsion from the party, has given birth to my child,” Yadav said.Providing background to the controversy, Yadav recalled that a post had gone viral last year from his Facebook account, claiming he had been “in a relationship, for 12 years” with a woman. He reiterated that the post was not authored by him and alleged that his social media account had been compromised.He claimed the post was the result of “hacking” carried out by what he described as “the five Jaichands,” using a metaphor for traitors.Naming them publicly, Yadav said, “There has been some suspense about who the Jaichands I have been speaking about are. Here are the names — Mukesh Raushan, Sanjay Yadav, Shakti Singh Yadav, Rameez and Sunil Singh.”Notably, Sanjay Yadav is a sitting RJD Rajya Sabha MP, Sunil Singh is a member of the legislative council, Mukesh Raushan and Shakti Singh Yadav are former MLAs and Rameez is considered close to Tejashwi Yadav, Tej Pratap’s younger brother and the RJD’s national working president.Rejecting the latest claims outright, Yadav told reporters, “I reject this completely, a controversy was created, Akash Bhati will be revealing the truth. They are trying to defame me. I will go to court.”He said he became aware of the rumours after being told that union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi had “congratulated” him on the alleged birth of a child, which he said shocked him.Yadav also linked the renewed controversy to his recent political activities. “Recently, I hosted a well-attended feast on the occasion of Makar Sankranti. This has made my detractors wary of the prospects of my party. I will seek legal action against them. I will move the court. I have also sought an appointment with Home Minister Samrat Choudhary,” he said.Appealing for an end to the speculation, he added, “I beg my detractors to let me live in peace. I know the person with whom the woman is in a relationship and who, I believe, is the father of the child. They are causing mental anguish to me by dragging my name.”Tej Pratap Yadav was expelled from the RJD last year for what the party described as “serious breaches of moral and social values,” following a public fallout triggered by the viral Facebook post.The episode added to long-running controversies surrounding him, including his strained marriage with Aishwarya, the granddaughter of former Bihar chief minister Daroga Rai.Aishwarya had left their matrimonial home within months of the wedding, alleging mistreatment, and the divorce case is still pending in court.Since his expulsion, Yadav has floated his own political outfit, the Janshakti Janata Dal and has repeatedly ruled out any return to the RJD, saying he would “choose death over returning to that party.” He has maintained that his political journey is guided by “principles and self-respect,” not by the pursuit of power.",Janshakti Janata Dal (JJD) chief Tej Pratap Yadav strongly denied rumours circulating on social media that a woman allegedly linked to him has given birth to his child.

Weeks After Noida Techie's Death, Delhi Biker Dies After Falling Into Pit Dug By Jal Board

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Delhi unit president Saurabh Bharadwaj, along with several party workers was detained by police on Sunday while protesting in west Delhi’s Janakpuri over the death of 25-year-old Kamal Dhyani.The protest was organised to demand justice for Dhyani, who died earlier on Thursday after his motorcycle allegedly fell into an unmarked pit.According to the AAP, Bharadwaj and other leaders had gathered in Janakpuri to pay tribute to Dhyani by lighting candles. However, Delhi police erected barricades across the area and detained the protesters.In a series of posts on X, Bharadwaj said that he was being taken away by the police and questioned the action against what he described as a peaceful tribute.“Today we had come to Janakpuri to pay tribute to Kamal Dhyaani who was killed there. The police has put up barricades everywhere today. We said no sloganeering is happening, we will just light candles and leave. Is even this much now a crime?” he wrote.He also raised political allegations in his post, claiming, “The BJP government had stolen the election through deceit and fraud exactly one year ago today, and the entire Delhi is commemorating this one-year anniversary.”Bharadwaj further demanded justice for Kamal Dhyani, action against the Delhi Police Commissioner and criticised Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta.Speaking to reporters while being detained, Bharadwaj accused the authorities of suppressing dissent. “You can see the level of dictatorship. No one lodged a complaint, even when the parents of Kamal Dhyani went to six police stations. The police are detaining us when we have all gathered to pay tribute to him,” he said.The protest follows days of sharp criticism by the AAP against the Delhi Police and the BJP-led Delhi government over Dhyani’s death.Bharadwaj has alleged police negligence and attempts to hide crucial information related to the case. He claimed that Dhyani’s family visited six police stations on the night of the incident but no missing complaint was registered and that the location data of the victim’s mobile phone was allegedly deleted.Dhyani, a resident of Janakpuri, reportedly fell into a deep pit late at night while riding his motorcycle on February 5. His family and friends have alleged that the pit was poorly barricaded and unmarked and that timely police action could have saved his life.The incident has drawn comparisons with a recent case in Noida, where a young IT professional died after his car plunged into a water-filled construction pit, renewing concerns over road safety , unmarked construction sites and accountability of civic authorities in the Delhi-NCR region.The Delhi government has said that it has taken cognisance of the Janakpuri incident and assured action against those responsible. Meanwhile, the AAP has said it will continue to raise the issue and demand accountability for what it calls a preventable tragedy.","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Delhi unit president Saurabh Bharadwaj was detained by police on Sunday while protesting in west Delhi’s Janakpuri.

The broader political calculus

NEW DELHI: As Kerala heads toward another high-stakes assembly election, a controversial name has returned to the centre of a new political storm. Jamaat-e-Islami, long part of the state's complex web of alliances and rivalries, is now the trigger for an escalating war of words between the CPM , the Congress and the BJP.What began as a debate over electoral support has quickly turned into a larger fight over secularism, minority politics and ideological credibility.The latest round of exchanges was triggered after Congress leader and the leader of the opposition VD Satheesan indicated that the UDF would accept support from Jamaat-e-Islami, asserting that the organisation had clarified it does not advocate a religion-based nation in India.That remark drew immediate criticism from both the CPM and the BJP, who accused the Congress of legitimising a group they describe as communal.Senior BJP leader K Surendran accused the Congress of closeness with Jamaat-e-Islami and alleged that the party was “whitewashing” communal forces. He went further, claiming that “sharia” would be implemented in Kerala if the Congress and the UDF came to power. “The Congress has now adopted a blatant communal stand by whitewashing terrorist groups like Jamaat-e-Islami,” Surendran said.The CPM, too, sharpened its attack. State secretary M V Govindan alleged that the Congress had adopted a position portraying Jamaat-e-Islami as a non-communal organisation and accused it of attempting to give the outfit a “good certificate”.Satheesan rejected the allegations and accused the CPM of hypocrisy. He alleged that the Marxist party had itself benefited from Jamaat-e-Islami support in the past.“CPM is hypocritical. Until the parliamentary elections, they appeased minorities. Later, they appeased majority communities. Currently, there is confusion overall. They are in a state where they do not know what they are saying or doing. They are pretending to forget what they said in the past,” Satheesan said during the UDF’s Puthu Yuga Yatra in Kasaragod.He further claimed, “For 42 years, Jamaate-Islami was aligned with the CPM. Many times, individuals like Govindan and Pinarayi Vijayan were elected with the support of Jamaat-e-Islami. Clips of Pinarayi Vijayan’s speech justifying Jamaat-e-Islami and Deshabhimani’s editorial can be sent to Govindan. If his forgetfulness is deliberate, then nothing can be done.”Satheesan also argued that the opposition was unfairly being targeted for engaging with community organisations. “We do not interfere in the internal matters of any community organisations. Our wish is for everyone to walk together. It is not the opposition leader’s job to comment on any of this,” he said.In Kerala, references to Jamaat-e-Islami typically point to Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, a socio-religious organisation with an active presence in the state through educational institutions, social initiatives and community networks. Its political platform is the Welfare Party of India, which has contested elections and participated in local alliances.The organisation is not a dominant electoral force in Kerala but commands influence in certain regions, particularly in parts of northern districts. In a closely contested political landscape where margins can matter, even limited organisational backing can acquire significance.Jamaat-e-Islami has been in controversy several times for its ultra-conservative views. Only last month its leader Shaikh Muhammed Karakunnu said that no true believer who loves Prophet Muhammad can reject Islamic Republic.In a Facebook post titled ‘Would true believers reject Islamic Republic?' posted on January 17, Karakunnu said Prophet was the founder of Islamic Republic, and its headquarters was Medina and it was established without shedding even a single drop of blood.The remarks came amid the CPM's attack on Jamaat-e-Islami, accusing the organisation of subscribing to the ideology of establishing a theocratic nation.CPM leaders were quick to cite Karakunnu's remarks as vindication of their stand.""The people of that land welcomed its leader with open arms, choosing him as their ruler. They even gave their land his name: Madinatun-Nabi (The City of the Prophet). It was an ideal-based, humanitarian and pluralistic nation. At that time, the Muslim population there was only 15%,"" he said.Kerala’s politics has traditionally been bipolar, with power alternating between the CPM-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the Congress-led UDF. The BJP, despite a growing vote share, has struggled to translate support into seats. In this context, debates over minority outreach and ideological positioning carry both symbolic and electoral weight.For the CPM, attacking the Congress over Jamaat-e-Islami allows it to question the UDF’s secular credentials while attempting to consolidate its own base among both minority and majority voters. For the BJP, the issue provides an opportunity to frame the Congress and the Left as engaging in minority appeasement, a narrative it has consistently deployed in Kerala.The Congress, meanwhile, appears to be balancing objectives of reassuring minority voters that it remains open to their support, while countering charges that it is endorsing communal politics.Kerala has a significant Muslim population, and minority consolidation can influence outcomes in several constituencies. Historically, the Indian Union Muslim League has been the primary Muslim political force within the UDF. However, the presence of organisations like Jamaat-e-Islami adds layers to the competitive dynamic.The CPM has previously worked with various community organisations, and its leaders have often defended engagement as part of Kerala’s plural political culture. The Congress now argues that similar engagement cannot be selectively labelled communal.The BJP’s intervention introduces a national dimension, especially as it seeks to expand its footprint in a state where it has yet to break through decisively. By raising the spectre of “sharia” and accusing the Congress of legitimising extremist forces, it seeks to polarise the debate and position itself as the defender of secular governance.The controversy has also intersected with rival mass contact programmes. While the UDF is conducting its Puthu Yuga Yatra to present what it describes as a vision for Kerala’s future, the LDF is running the Vikasana Munnetta Jatha to highlight development initiatives under chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.Each side has used the Jamaat-e-Islami debate to undercut the other’s campaign narrative. Satheesan has suggested that the CPM’s criticism stems from discomfort over the UDF’s electoral confidence, while CPM leaders argue that the Congress is attempting to normalise communal elements.At its core, the clash over Jamaat-e-Islami reflects deeper tensions in Kerala politics like how parties engage with community organisations, how secularism is defined in practice, and how minority support is negotiated in a competitive electoral field.","Jamaat-e-Islami, long part of the state's complex web of alliances and rivalries, is now the trigger for an escalating war of words. What began as a debate over electoral support has quickly turned into a larger fight over secularism, minority politics and ideological credibility. The latest round of exchanges was triggered after Congress leader and the leader of the opposition VD Satheesan indicated that the UDF would accept support from the organisation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128073857,imgsize-65704,width-400,resizemode-4/kerala-elections.jpg"

Ukraine to Gaza: Malaysia PM Anwar Ibrahim hails PM Modi’s unwavering global peace push

NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta on Sunday praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership, emphasising a shift toward female leadership in governance.In a ceremony marking the first anniversary of the BJP-led Delhi government, chief minister Rekha Gupta and BJP National President Nitin Nabin officially flagged off a massive fleet of 4,000 electric buses, making Delhi's EV fleet the largest in the country.Gupta credited the team's 365-day effort, saying women-led development is thriving under PM Modi's guidance adding that the event served as both a milestone for urban mobility and a celebration of the administration's ""women-led development"" philosophy.""This is the wonder of PM Modi's leadership: the women's driver, the women's secretary, and the women's chief minister, where women-led development is possible in the country. I am pleased that on 8th February, we are able to serve the people of Delhi, thanks to their trust and blessings. A large fleet of 4,000 EV buses has been handed over to the people of Delhi, making it the largest in the country. I am pleased that all our ministers and the entire government have been working for Delhi for 365 days,"" she said.The addition of 4,000 electric buses aims to drastically reduce the city's carbon footprint and modernise public transit.CM Rekha Gupta was joined by Transport Minister Pankaj Kumar Singh, PWD Minister Parvesh Verma, and National President Nitin Nabin.CM Gupta, along with Transport Minister Pankaj Kumar Singh, PWD Minister Parvesh Verma and BJP National President Nitin Nabin, flagged off electric buses and the Delhi-Panipat bus service to mark the BJP-led government's first year in office.Addressing a gathering, chief minister Rekha Gupta said that the people of Delhi ended years of neglect in development by electing the BJP government.""For eleven years, Delhi lagged behind in development. The hopes and aspirations of the people of Delhi withered away. Delhi stopped dreaming of development. The people of Delhi were left without basic amenities such as water, sewage, and healthcare. But in the 2025 assembly elections, the people of Delhi gave a befitting reply to those who claimed to be the masters of Delhi,"" CM Gupta said.""Arrogant Kejriwal used to say, 'You will have to be reborn to defeat me.' But the people of Delhi, in this very lifetime, in this very Ramlila Maidan, changed the atmosphere of Delhi by forming the BJP government. The people of Delhi showed that if they can elevate someone to a position of power with love and affection, they also know how to bring them down,"" he said.Further, transport minister Pankaj Singh said the BJP government is fulfilling its promises as it completed one year in office, announcing the introduction of 500 electric buses and improved connectivity between Delhi and Panipat.","Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership, emphasising a shift toward female leadership in governance.

The mortal remains of 58‑year‑old Haryana Police Inspector Jagdish Prasad, who succumbed to fatal injuries sustained while rescuing people after a giant swing collapsed at the Surajkund fairgrounds, were cremated with state honours in his native Dengar village in Uttar Pradesh on Sunday.Prasad’s last rites were performed with full rituals on the banks of the Yamuna River, where his son Gaurav lit the funeral pyre. Hundreds of people from the village and nearby areas gathered to pay their respects, an official said, news agency PTI reported.Paying tribute to Prasad’s bravery, Palwal SP Varun Singla said every Indian is proud of his dedication and courage. The SP also consoled the family members of the late inspector.The accident occurred on Saturday evening when about 19 people were riding a giant swing at the fair around 6 pm. The swing tilted before crashing to the ground, leaving the police officer dead, and several others injured.Prasad, who joined the Haryana Armed Police in 1989 and was due to retire in March after completing 36 years of service, was among the first to respond to the accident, senior officers said. While trying to help those trapped under the collapsed structure, he sustained severe injuries that later proved fatal.Prasad’s nephew Prashant, who was at the venue at the time of the incident, described the sequence of events.“When the swing broke, Jagdish uncle was the first to engage in rescue operations. He began pulling out those trapped beneath the swing. He had already rescued some people and was still trying when the broken swing tilted too far towards him, trapping his neck. He suffered serious injuries. After this, he was taken to the hospital but could not be saved,” Prashant told news agency PTI.Speaking about the last time the family met Prasad, his son Gaurav said, “He had promised to meet again only after the fair was over, but that meeting proved to be the last. One of my sisters had to get married in November, but all shattered now.” Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini also expressed condolences and assured full support to the family saying, ""I assure the family members that the government stands with them in every possible way. We will provide all possible assistance. Along with this, the police officer who was martyred will be provided with financial security, as he was on duty there. We will also provide a government job to one of his children,"" he added, as quoted by news agency ANI.","Jagdish Prasad, 58, died after a giant swing collapsed at a fair in Haryana, India.

NEW DELHI: Police on Sunday arrested the swing operator and one of his staff members, a day after an on-duty inspector was killed and 12 others were injured when a giant ‘Tsunami’ ride snapped mid-air and crashed at the Surajkund fairgrounds in Faridabad.The accident occurred on Saturday evening during the 39th Surajkund International Crafts Mela. Around 19 people were on the ride when it suddenly tilted and collapsed to the ground.Inspector Jagdish Prasad, 58, died while attempting to rescue those trapped in the swing, officials said. He had joined the Haryana Armed Police in 1989 and was scheduled to retire in March after completing 36 years of service. His body was handed over to his family on Sunday following a post-mortem examination.“A special investigation team formed to probe the incident has arrested two accused – Mohammad Shakir, a resident of Himachal Pradesh’s Sirmour district, and the proprietor of Himachal Fun Care that operated the giant swing, and Nitesh from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh, who worked under Shakir. The role of others is being examined,” Yashpal, spokesperson for the Faridabad police told news agency PTI.The 12 injured include female Assistant Sub-Inspector Neelam, female constable Sharmila, Special Police Officer Rajesh, and civilians Harsh Prakash, Prashant, Amisha, Parvinder, Sunil, Shivani, Balbir, Anuj and Pooja.Five of them have been discharged after treatment, Yashpal said.Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini directed officials on Sunday to ensure strict compliance with safety standards at the fair and other public events. “The government stands firmly with the family of Jagdish Prasad in this difficult time. Those seriously injured in the accident will receive financial assistance of Rs 1 lakh each from the state government,” Saini said.The district administration said the fair would continue on Sunday, though the area around the swing has been cordoned off pending investigation.On Saturday night, Haryana director general of police (DGP) Ajay Singhal announced a compensation of Rs 1 crore for Prasad’s family and a government job for one of his relatives. He also said the inspector would be accorded martyr status.“Inspector Jagdish Prasad made a commendable effort to rescue the injured while on duty. His death is a profound tragedy for the police department.“The department will provide financial assistance to the family as much as possible, and employment will be provided to an eligible member under the compassionate leave policy,” the DGP said.On Sunday, DGP Singhal and Faridabad Commissioner Satendra Kumar Gupta met Prasad’s family to offer condolences and later visited the hospital to inquire about the injured.Tourism Director Parth Gupta and Faridabad Deputy Commissioner Ayush Sinha also inspected the fairgrounds to review security arrangements.Officials said the accident took place barely an hour after a gate collapsed at the venue, injuring two people, including a child.Police had earlier constituted a four-member Special Investigation Team led by DCP (Crime) Mukesh Kumar. The team includes ACP (Crime) Varun Dahiya and Sub-Inspector Sanjay Kumar of Surajkund police station. The SIT has been tasked with conducting a detailed probe, determining whether there was negligence, and examining compliance with safety norms.According to a complaint filed by assistant sub-inspector Sunny, he and Inspector Prasad were on duty at the fair when they noticed several people riding the ‘Tsunami’ swing. As the ride snapped mid-air, Prasad attempted to rescue those trapped. The swing then broke from one side and fell, causing serious injuries. Prasad later died in hospital.“The death of the inspector was caused due to the deliberate endangerment of people's lives by Himachal Fun Fair’s proprietor Mohammad Shakir and his staff, who did not maintain the safety standards,” the ASI stated in his complaint.Separately, the district administration has formed an inquiry committee headed by additional deputy commissioner-cum-Mela Administrator Satbir Singh.The panel includes DCP Maqsood Ahmed, Arvind Gupta, Head of the Mechanical Department at YMCA University, Hitesh Kumar, Executive Engineer (Mechanical), and Ashwini Gaur, Executive Engineer (Electrical).","Inspector Jagdish Prasad, 58, died while attempting to rescue those trapped in the swing, officials said.

Encounters, arrests and surrenders since 2024

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday said the Centre’s strategy against Left-Wing Extremism has started delivering clear results and asserted that Naxalism will be fully eradicated before March 31.He made the remarks after chairing a high-level security review meeting in Raipur, weeks ahead of the government’s stated deadline.Sharing details of the meeting on X, Shah said a mix of security-focused operations, infrastructure expansion, disruption of Maoist funding channels and an effective surrender policy had significantly weakened the insurgency.“Today in Raipur, I held a review meeting with the Chhattisgarh government and officials on anti-Naxal operations. The security-centric strategy, infrastructure development, targeting of the Naxal financial network and the surrender policy have yielded positive results, and Naxalism will be completely eradicated before March 31,” Shah wrote.The meeting, held at a hotel in Nava Raipur Atal Nagar, was attended by Chhattisgarh chief minister Vishnu Deo Sai, deputy chief minister Vijay Sharma, the Union home secretary, the director of the Intelligence Bureau and the special secretary (internal security) in the ministry of home affairs.Senior security leadership was also present, including the directors general of the CRPF, BSF, ITBP and the NIA.Top police officials from Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Telangana also took part in the discussions.Chhattisgarh’s Bastar region, which includes seven districts and shares borders with Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, has traditionally been regarded as the strongest base of Maoist activity.However, intensified anti-Naxal operations over the past few years have considerably weakened the movement in the region, according to officials.Since January 2024, security forces have made major gains in Chhattisgarh.More than 500 Naxalites have been killed in encounters, including senior CPI (Maoist) leader and general secretary Nambala Keshava Rao, also known as Basavaraju, according to police data cited by news agency PTI.During the same period, around 1,900 Naxalites were arrested and over 2,500 surrendered in the state, highlighting what the Centre describes as the combined impact of sustained operations and rehabilitation measures.","Home minister Amit Shah said the Centre’s strategy against Left-Wing Extremism has started delivering clear results.

Forest officials arrested a seven-member gang and seized tiger skin, claws, and teeth during an operation in the Kannur district of Kerala. The arrests followed secret intelligence inputs about an attempt to sell tiger body parts.Acting on the tip-off received on Friday night, forest officials launched a joint operation and tracked down three suspects near a school at Kathiroor in Thalassery taluk, officials told news agency PTI.The first to be arrested were Ashwin, a native of Eruvatti, and Sandheesh and Balan, both natives of Cheruvanchery.“From these persons, we recovered tiger skin, claws and teeth. They had reached the spot to sell these objects,” Nithinraj T, Forest Range Forest Officer, Kottiyoor, told PTI.Based on information obtained during preliminary interrogation, forest officials arrested four more persons, Sharath KK of Kallikandy, Rajeesh of Mangad, Vithul from Cheruvanchery and Rakhil from Malal.An Innova car allegedly used to transport the tiger body parts and a scooter used during the operation were also seized, ANI reported.“The seized objects were examined by a doctor, who confirmed that they belonged to a tiger.We have sent them for DNA testing as part of further investigation,” Nithinraj told PTI.According to ANI, the operation was carried out by a team led by Kottiyoor Range Officer Nithin Raj and the Kannur Forest Vigilance Unit, with participation from several forest and vigilance officers.The arrested persons were produced before the Thalassery Judicial First Class Magistrate Court on Saturday and remanded to judicial custody. Forest officials said they would soon approach the court seeking custody of the accused for further interrogation.Another forest official told PTI that the investigation so far has revealed that the arrested persons were allegedly linked to poachers operating in Karnataka, raising suspicion that the tiger may have been hunted there.

KHARGONEAn elderly man in Madhya Pradesh learnt the hard way that the law not only has long arms but also a long memory, after he was arrested in a wheat theft case registered more than 45 years ago.Salim and six others had allegedly stolen wheat from fields in the Balsamund Kakad area in 1980, when he was just 20, Sub-Divisional Officer of Police (Mandleshwar) Shweta Shukla told news agency PTI on Sunday.The stolen produce was worth about Rs 100 at the time, she said, adding that a quintal (100 kg) of good-quality wheat then cost Rs 115 — roughly Rs 1.15 per kg.After the theft, Salim, a resident of Balkhad village under Balakwada police station limits, went absconding and later settled into a quiet life. He ran a grocery shop with his son in Bag town of neighbouring Dhar district, police said.The case, however, remained pending in court, and a warrant was issued against him.Salim was finally traced to his shop in Bag during a cyber cell-assisted search for another accused and arrested on Saturday. During questioning, he told police he believed the case had been forgotten over the decades and that he was no longer at risk of legal action, said Khaltaka outpost in-charge Mithun Chauhan.Salim, son of Mujahid, was produced before a local court, which remanded him to judicial custody, Chauhan added.","Salim, then 20, stole wheat worth Rs 100 in 1980.

SIR hearing on without EC nod for deadline extension; SC to hear 7 petitions on Bengal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/sir-hearing-on-without-ec-nod-for-deadline-extension-sc-to-hear-7-petitions-on-bengal/articleshow/128097346.cms,"(With additional inputs by Suparna Goswami in Kolkata)





KOLKATA: Hearings for the Special Intensive Revision of the electoral roll continued at multiple places in Bengal on Sunday despite Election Commission not issuing any notification extending the deadline for the exercise.The SIR hearing deadline was Feb 7, but the sheer number of pending cases prompted state chief electoral officer Manoj Agarwal to write to EC on Saturday, asking for an extension of the deadline by a week. The CEO also requested the poll panel to push back the deadline for the publication of the final voters’ list, which the original notification says is Feb 14.Most of those who turned up for hearing on Sunday had applied for enrolment as new voters as their names were not on the draft SIR list published last month or had “logical discrepancies” in their enumeration forms.“The extension of the SIR hearing and verification deadline is an internal matter. EC generally does not issue a notification for it. However, if the date for the publication of the final electoral roll is extended, EC will have to issue a notification,” an official at the poll panel said. He, however, did not clarify whether an extension of the hearing deadline would automatically push back the timeline for the publication of the voters’ list.Sources said Agarwal asked all district election officers on Sunday to continue and expedite work related to hearings, document upload, verification and disposal of cases without waiting for EC to extend the deadline.“Hearings were conducted on Sunday at multiple places in Kolkata, in the Noapara (North 24 Parganas) and Kurseong assembly constituencies, as well as in seven assembly constituencies in South 24 Parganas,” an officer said.Supreme Court is set to hear seven petitions on the Bengal SIR — including one filed by CM Mamata Banerjee — at 2 pm on Monday. The petitions will be heard together by a three-judge bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and justices Joymalya Bagchi and N V Anjaria.At Survey Building in Alipore, many of those standing in long queues said they had been issued hearing notices a day or two ago.Abhijit Das and his wife attended a hearing on behalf of their 18-year-old son, who is preparing for his HS exams. “The exams start on Feb 12. We didn’t want him to waste time standing in a queue,” Das said.Afsar Hussain, 42, was called for a hearing as his name was not on the draft SIR list. “I have been voting since 2005. My name wasn’t there on the 2002 voters’ list. But my parents’ names were there,” he said. Hussain’s hearing was scheduled for 11.30 am but even an hour later, he was still waiting for his BLO to arrive and assist him.At Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Institution in Phoolbagan, Tariq Ali said his BLO called him on Saturday night asking him to appear for a hearing the next day. “I asked the BLO why I was being called today if the hearing process was over, but there was no answer.”",Hearings for the Special Intensive Revision of the electoral roll continued at multiple places in Bengal on Sunday.

Elon Musk in Epstein files?





Elon Musk offered his support to victims of Jeffrey Epstein by offering to cover their legal expenses if they publicly name their abusers. His offer came in response to a discussion about a new PSA featuring Epstein's victims that aired on Super Bowl Sunday.The tech billionaire made this commitment on X, replying to conservative commentator Matt Walsh's posts about the PSA. ""I will pay for the defense of anyone who speaks the truth about this and is sued for doing so,"" said Musk.The PSA showed several women who claim to be Epstein's victims, urging Attorney General Pam Bondi to support their cause. In the video, they appeared alongside photos of themselves from when the alleged abuse occurred, stating, ""After years of being kept apart, we're standing together"" and ""Because we all deserve the truth.""Walsh questioned why these women haven't named their abusers directly. He pointed out that the timing of their campaign was curious, noting it began just as Biden left office. He suggested they could safely reveal names through Congress members who could speak on the floor without legal risk.However, he noted that this hasn't happened and questioned why. Further dismissing the defence that women fear being sued, Walsh added, ""For those claiming that they can’t name names because they’ll be sued: they could simply give the names to any of their many (and mostly very recent ) advocates in congress, who could read the names out loud from the floor, insulating themselves and these women from any litigation.But they refuse to do that. Why?""It is in reponse to this that Musk offered to cover the legal costs.A newly released photograph from the latest batch of Jeffrey Epstein files shows the disgraced financier at a 2015 dinner attended by Elon Musk and other tech figures. The image, disclosed by the US Department of Justice as part of a large release of investigative records, appears to show Musk seated at a long dining table alongside other prominent guests.Emails included in the documents indicate Epstein had noted plans to dine in Los Angeles with “musk thiel zuckerberg” in August 2015 and later sent himself a photograph from the gathering.Musk has previously said he declined invitations to Epstein’s private island and has not been accused of any crime.","Elon Musk offered his support to victims of Jeffrey Epstein by offering to cover their legal expenses.

What the numbers mean





LDP’s revival under Takaichi

Far-Right presence still marginal





Who is Sanae Takaichi?



China tensions grow under Takaichi







Economic promises







International reactions









Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), led by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, is on course to win Sunday’s snap election by a landslide, according to projections.The conservative leader is expected to deliver 316 seats of the 465-seat lower house to the LDP — the party’s best-ever result. Together with coalition partner Japan Innovation Party (Ishin), the ruling bloc controls 352 seats, giving it a commanding majority in parliament.NHK figures show Ishin is expected to secure 36 seats, while opposition parties won a combined 113 seats.Once officially confirmed, the result will give Takaichi wide scope to push through her conservative agenda. With a two-thirds majority, she would also be in a strong position to pursue her long-held aim of revising Japan’s pacifist constitution.If the coalition secures at least 261 seats — a threshold known as an “absolute stable majority” — it can control parliamentary committees, easing the passage of legislation, including key budget proposals.A supermajority of 310 seats would allow the coalition to override the upper house, where it currently does not hold a majority.If the polls prove wrong and she loses her lower house majority, Takaichi has said she will resign.Takaichi, 64, called the snap election to capitalise on her strong personal approval ratings after taking over the leadership of the long-dominant LDP late last year. Hugely popular with voters, she nonetheless leads a party that has governed Japan for most of the past seven decades but has recently struggled with funding irregularities and religious-linked scandals.She dissolved parliament just three months into her tenure, hoping to secure a fresh mandate and stabilise the party before her popularity began to wane — making the election a high-stakes political gamble.Speaking in a television interview as results came in, she said, “This election involved major policy shifts — particularly a major shift in economic and fiscal policy, as well as strengthening security policy.”“These are policies that have drawn a great deal of opposition ... If we have received the public's support, then we truly must tackle these issues with all our strength.”The projected victory marks a sharp contrast with the LDP’s recent troubles. Under Takaichi’s two predecessors, the party lost its parliamentary majority amid corruption scandals and rising living costs.In 2024, the LDP lost its majority in both houses of parliament, and its decades-old coalition with Komeito collapsed. In this election, Komeito joined forces with the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan to form the largest opposition bloc in the lower house.Despite facing a more unified opposition, Takaichi’s personal popularity appears to have revived the party’s fortunes, with government approval ratings mostly hovering above 70%.The far-right Sanseito party fielded a record 190 candidates and was expected to increase its presence in parliament. Opinion polls suggested it may win around 15 seats, up from just two.The gains would build on last year’s upper house election, when the party broke through with fiery warnings about foreigners and attracted notable support from younger voters.Sanseito has sought ties with US President Donald Trump’s MAGA movement. While it is expected to remain a small party, its emergence has helped shift Japan’s political discourse to the right, a trend seen in other advanced democracies.Japan’s first elected female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi is an ultraconservative leader known as much for her hardline views as for her distinctive personal style. A self-described admirer of Margaret Thatcher, she has long aspired to be Japan’s “Iron Lady,” pledging to “work, work, work” after taking office in October.A staunch conservative, Takaichi opposes same-sex marriage, legislation allowing married couples to use separate surnames, and the idea of women succeeding to the imperial throne. She has consistently backed more traditional roles for women in society and family life, despite becoming a symbol-breaking figure herself.Strongly pro-defence, she is focused on maintaining a close alliance with the United States while strengthening Japan’s own military capabilities. She has struck up a notably warm relationship with US President Donald Trump, meeting him just days after assuming office.A motorbike enthusiast and heavy metal drummer, Takaichi has become a pop-culture phenomenon, particularly among young voters. Her appeal is driven as much by her image as her policies, with personal items and catchphrases going viral and a massive following on social media, even as critics point to her limited promotion of women within her cabinet.Relations with China — Japan’s largest trading partner — have become increasingly strained after Takaichi suggested last November that Japan could intervene militarily if China attempted to seize self-ruled Taiwan by force.Seen as a China hawk even before taking office, Takaichi made the remarks barely two weeks into her premiership, reinforcing concerns among voters already uneasy about her push for sharply higher defence spending.In the televised interview, she largely sidestepped questions about how soaring military outlays would be funded or how her government plans to ease diplomatic tensions with Beijing.Analysts say her rightward shift is unlikely to fundamentally alter Japan’s broader foreign policy direction. Takaichi is expected to maintain stable ties with South Korea, driven by shared concerns over security threats from North Korea and China.A key election pledge — suspending the 8% sales tax on food — was aimed at helping households cope with rising prices. However, the promise has rattled investors concerned about how the policy would be funded, given Japan’s heavy government debt burden.Critics, including businesses, are sceptical that higher spending and tax cuts can revive the sluggish economy.One Tokyo voter, Ritsuko Ninomiya, told the BBC, “People want their lives to be better and more comfortable because we are so accustomed to not having inflation [costs rising]... so people are very worried. I think we need a long-term solution rather than short-term fixes.”During the campaign, Takaichi pushed to toughen immigration rules, review foreign ownership of Japanese land, and tackle unpaid taxes and health insurance by foreign nationals.Critics say the policies risk creating anxiety and division in a country where only 3% of the population are foreign nationals.Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Takaichi on her “ landmark victory,"" saying Japan and India’s friendship could reach “greater heights.”US President Donald Trump also congratulated Takaichi, calling her a “highly respected and very popular” leader.Writing on Truth Social, Trump said, “I wish you Great Success in passing your Conservative, Peace Through Strength Agenda.”He added, “The wonderful people of Japan, who voted with such enthusiasm, will always have my strong support.”US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called it a “big victory,” saying “when Japan is strong, the US is strong in Asia.”People across Japan braved snow and severe weather to vote in the country’s first mid-winter election in 36 years. The transport ministry said 37 train lines and 58 ferry routes were closed, while 54 flights were cancelled as of Sunday morning. There was rare snowfall in Tokyo as voters headed to polling stations.","Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), led by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, is on course to win Sunday's snap election by a landslide.

I’m a proud citizen of Frisco, and I’m not going anywhere.""Burt Thakur spoke about H-1B earlier too and said he had no authority over federal immigration policy or visa enforcement and rejected the suggestion that local officials were orchestrating demographic change. “I really would have no problem with any federal agency coming in and doing an audit,” Thakur said earlier. “And if things are found that are illegal … I’ll be the first supporter and the biggest supporter of those agencies coming in and being able to do their job. ”“If people have done stuff legally … it’s something that is their right to do,” he said, adding that he takes offense at suggestions that the presence of Indian residents itself is problematic. “Please, feel free to tell me what percentage of the population is allowed to be Indian,” Thakur said.Facing questions over Indian donors, Thakur said he is an American citizen who served during 9/11 and is now focused on local governance in his capacity as a councilman.",Frisco council's first Indian-origin member Burt Thakur spoke about the issue and said Indians who came to America upheld American Dream because American Dream needs participation.

Mandelson-Epstein Scandal Rocks UK Parliament; Starmer Under Siege Over Russian Spy Claims, Judgment

Leadership challenges add to pressure on Starmer





The global fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal is threatening the political future of a world leader — but not the one many might expect.British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has never been directly linked to Epstein, yet he is facing mounting political pressure connected to the wider fallout of the case. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump — whose name appears in some investigative files related to the disgraced financier — is facing no immediate political threat. As political tensions grow in Britain, Epstein victims continue to push for further accountability in Washington.The contrast highlights the different political environments facing both leaders. While British institutions focused on scrutiny and accountability are actively probing links tied to the scandal, Trump’s influence over the Justice Department and strong backing within the Republican-controlled Congress have limited political fallout for him. At the same time, the reach of the Epstein files continues to expand globally, with implications now touching countries including Norway and Poland, nearly seven years after Epstein’s death.In the United Kingdom, public anger over any association with Epstein has been intense. King Charles III stripped his brother, former Prince Andrew, of royal titles and removed him from royal duties due to his links with Epstein.In contrast, the United States has not seen similar political or institutional consequences for figures connected to Epstein, who died by suicide in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking and abuse charges involving underage girls.One of the most prominent figures to face professional consequences was former US treasury secretary Larry Summers. The former Harvard University president stepped back from public roles last year after emails revealed he had exchanged sexist remarks and sought personal advice from Epstein. Summers later said he was “deeply ashamed.”Trump, meanwhile, is attempting to move past renewed scrutiny after the US Department of Justice said there would be no further prosecutions tied to the case. Authorities have not charged Trump or anyone else named in newly released files, and there is no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the president. Some references to Trump in the documents are routine, while others include newly surfaced, unverified sexual assault allegations and accounts from some Epstein victims describing encounters with the future president.Starmer’s political crisis, however, has deepened. His leadership came under further strain after unrest among Labour Party lawmakers added to ongoing challenges facing his government.During a tense parliamentary session, Starmer acknowledged he was aware of the relationship between former Cabinet minister Peter Mandelson and Epstein before appointing him ambassador to Washington.Starmer dismissed Mandelson last year after earlier Epstein documents showed Mandelson maintained ties with Epstein after his 2008 sex offense conviction in Florida. The controversy intensified this week following newly released files suggesting Mandelson may have shared sensitive, market-moving information with Epstein during the 2008 financial crisis. Mandelson is now under criminal investigation and has resigned from both the House of Lords and the Labour Party.“Mandelson betrayed our country, our parliament and my party,” Starmer told parliament.The political fallout in Britain is being driven not only by Epstein’s crimes but by deeper, ongoing tensions in British politics. Starmer is facing pressure less than two years after winning a landslide election victory, with speculation growing about potential leadership challenges within the Labour Party.British prime ministers face constant internal party pressure in a system where leadership challenges can emerge quickly. The current crisis comes after more than a decade of political instability that saw the UK cycle through multiple prime ministers.The Epstein scandal has also revived scrutiny of Mandelson’s long and controversial political career. Once a key architect of Labour’s transformation in the 1990s alongside Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, Mandelson helped move the party toward the political center. However, repeated controversies — often linked to his connections with wealthy and influential figures — have overshadowed his legacy.The scandal has also revived debate about the British royal family, particularly Prince Andrew’s association with Epstein and his settlement with Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of abuse after being trafficked by Epstein. Andrew denied wrongdoing and made no admission of liability or guilt, but the settlement intensified public criticism and contributed to his removal from royal duties.While Epstein-related developments have created turbulence in US politics, they have not posed a direct threat to Trump’s presidency. He has not been accused of any crimes related to the case, though his past association with Epstein continues to draw scrutiny.Trump remains politically resilient despite ongoing controversies, from immigration policies to disputes over election integrity. His political strategy often involves overwhelming public discourse with multiple issues simultaneously, reducing the impact of any single controversy.","UK PM Keir Starmer has never been directly linked to Epstein, yet he is facing mounting political pressure.

‘Impregnate 20 Women, Create Super Race’: Inside Epstein’s SICKEST ‘Baby Ranch’ Plan Using His DNA





Jeffrey Epstein’s victims used the huge audience of Super Bowl Sunday to once again call for the release of millions of government documents linked to the late sex offender.In a short advert aired just before one of the most-watched television events in the United States, eight women stood together and demanded full transparency from the Trump administration. They held photos of themselves as children from the time they say they were abused by Epstein.“After years of being kept apart we’re standing together,” they said. “Because we all deserve the truth.”The public service announcement was released with World Without Exploitation, a human sex trafficking advocacy group. The video opened with the message, “On November 19, 2025, the Epstein Files Transparency Act was signed into law. 3 Million Files Still Have Not Been Released.”The video aired just before President Donald Trump and millions of other Americans tuned in to watch the Seattle Seahawks play the New England Patriots in the NFL championship.Earlier this week, Trump, whose second term has been clouded by attention on his past friendship with Epstein, said it was time to “move on” from the disgraced financier.On January 30, the US Department of Justice released about three million pages from its investigation into Epstein under the Epstein Files Transparency Act.The release included around 2,000 videos and 180,000 images.However, about half of the estimated six million files have not been made public. This has raised fresh fears among survivors that some of Epstein’s alleged accomplices may never face justice, and has led to new claims of a cover-up.The victims are now leading calls for the remaining files to be released. The video ends by urging the public to “stand with us” and to “tell Attorney General Pam Bondi it’s time for the truth”.The Department of Justice says the withheld files cannot be released because they reveal victims’ identities, include child pornography, or could affect ongoing federal investigations.“We didn’t protect or not protect anybody,” deputy attorney general Todd Blanche said, adding that the department had “completed” its release of the files.More than 38,000 references to Trump, his wife and his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida appear across 5,300 of the newly released files, reported The Telegraph.Epstein died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, in a death ruled a suicide. His longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell was jailed in 2022 and is serving a 20-year sentence for helping him recruit underage girls.According to a letter obtained by NBC News, members of Congress will be able to view the unredacted files on secure Justice Department computers starting on Monday.","Eight women held photos of themselves as children from the time they say they were abused by Epstein.

Along with email chains, the documents reveal a $6.5M gift, private travel and even university sanctions, in shocking revelations.Nowak, a popular mathematical biologist appears more than 4,000 times in the records released under the 2025 Epstein Files Transparency Act, as per The Sunday Guardian.The documents reveal that Epstein and Nowak shared a long-standing financial and personal relationship that continued even after the late billionaire was convicted in 2008.In 2003, Epstein gave $6.5 million to establish Program for Evolutionary Dynamics (PED) at Harvard which Nowak founded and led. This was a part of his larger $9.1 million donations to the university. Epstein also kept a private office in the PED building for 10 years and visited more than forty times between 2010 and 2018.In 2014, the two exchanged an email where the professor wrote to Epstein, ""our spy was captured after completing her mission."" To this Epstein responded, ""Did you torture her?""In another email, a writer told Nowak that Epstein wanted to have dinner with him, the 'Chomskys' and 'all the boys' at the Institute.“Jeffrey would like to have dinner at the Institute this Friday with the Chomskys and `all the boys' he says he would like an hour with you alone first—will this work for you? I know you said you have something starting at 4 pm at PED,” they wrote. Chomsky here refers to Noam Chomsky, who has also been mentioned in the files earlier.Apart from professional help and suspicious emails, Nowak also stayed at Epstein's New York apartment and thanked his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell for ""amazing hospitality"". He was also a planned beneficiary of $5 million in Epstein's will, just days before his death.Martin Nowak is an Austrian-born professor of math and biology at Harvard University. From cancer progression to viral systems, he has researched on numerous diverse topics. He also founded and ran the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics (PED) at the university.Born in Vienna in 1965, he went to Albertus Magnus School and studied Biochemistry and Mathematics at the University of Vienna. He went to Oxford as an Erwin Schrödinger Scholar in 1989 and became Professor of Mathematical Biology in 1997. He joined Harvard in 2003. A highly cited and popular scholar he has previously held positions at the Institute for Advanced Study as well.In 2020, Harvard shut down PED and banned Nowak from starting new research or advising students for at least two years. This was after he was suspended following a university review that found he had extensive and unreported contact with Epstein. The review also found that Nowak devoted a page to Epstein on the centre's website with links to the financier's website.However, all sanctions were lifted in 2023 and Nowak remains a professor with joint appointments in Mathematics and Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at the university.Epstein killed himself in Metropolitan Correctional Centre, New York City in 2019 after being arrested on sex trafficking charges. He had pleaded not guilty to sexually abusing girls as young as 14 and young women in New York and Florida in the early 2000s.","Harvard professor Martin Nowak's deep ties with convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have resurfaced after the release of the files by the Department of Justice.

US President Donald Trump has once again claimed that American elections are “rigged” and “stolen,” renewing calls for sweeping changes to voting rules that he says are necessary to restore public trust in the electoral system.In a post on Truth Social on Sunday, Trump warned that the United States risks political collapse unless major reforms are introduced.""America’s elections are rigged, stolen, and a laughingstock all over the world. We are either going to fix them, or we won’t have a country any longer,"" Trump wrote.In his post, Trump outlined three key demands under what he called the “Save America Act.”First, he called for mandatory government-issued photo identification for all voters. Second, he demanded proof of US citizenship at the time of voter registration. Third, he urged an end to most mail-in voting, allowing it only in limited circumstances such as illness, disability, military service or travel.Trump argued that these measures would prevent fraud and restore public confidence in elections. While several US states already require voter ID, the types of identification accepted vary widely across the country.His latest remarks follow comments in a recent interview in which he urged Republicans to “nationalise” and “take over” voting processes in at least 15 locations, though he did not specify which ones. Those comments drew criticism from election experts, who warned that federal control of local elections could undermine the independence of state and county authorities.Under the US Constitution, states hold primary responsibility for administering elections, although Congress can establish certain nationwide standards.Democratic leaders quickly condemned Trump’s statements. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused him of attempting to manipulate the electoral system for political gain.“What Donald Trump wants to do is try to nationalise the election. Translation: Steal it. And we’re not going to let it happen,” Jeffries said in an interview with CNN.Jeffries said Democrats had blocked Republican efforts to redraw congressional maps in what he described as unfair ways and had opposed attempts to expand federal control over election administration.According to US election data and multiple court rulings, no evidence has emerged to support claims of widespread fraud in recent national elections. More than 60 lawsuits challenging the 2020 election results were dismissed or withdrawn.","US President Donald Trump has once again claimed that American elections are “rigged” and “stolen,” renewing calls for sweeping changes to voting rules.

Why is Minneapolis witnessing unrest?





Minneapolis witnessed a fresh wave of unrest on Saturday as an anti-ICE protest outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building spiralled into chaotic scenes, including demonstrators hurling sex toys and other objects amid clashes with law enforcement.Videos circulating online showed protesters throwing items over security fencing toward the federal complex, which houses immigration enforcement operations.In one viral video, a pickup truck driver displaying anti-ICE placards, including one reading “Nuremberg 2.0”, was surrounded by demonstrators who appeared to mistake him for an opponent.Despite repeatedly shouting that he supported their cause, the man was confronted by members of the crowd, some of whom struck his vehicle and removed a sign from his hands. The situation eventually de-escalated after other protesters intervened.Authorities said the gathering later intensified, with some individuals allegedly throwing ice chunks and bottles at officers guarding the building.The Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office declared an unlawful assembly and confirmed that dozens of people were arrested.Officials stated that while many participants protested peacefully, some engaged in property damage and assaults, including an incident in which a deputy was reportedly struck.Counter-protesters were also present. Witness accounts and online footage suggested that individuals in a passing vehicle fired paintballs and pepper balls toward demonstrators, further escalating tensions.The protest coincided with ongoing federal immigration enforcement operations in the Twin Cities area.Recent remarks by federal officials indicated that personnel levels may be reduced, though operations continue under what has been described as “Operation Metro Surge.”The demonstrations stem from anger over the fatal shootings of two American nationals during separate encounters with federal immigration agents. Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three and poet, was shot last month as she drove away from immigration officers on a snowy Minneapolis street.Federal authorities described her as a threat, a claim disputed by local leaders. Her death triggered large-scale protests across Minneapolis and other US cities.Three weeks later, Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse at a Veterans Affairs hospital, was shot during a confrontation with border patrol agents who reportedly spotted his licensed firearm.Family members described him as compassionate and deeply troubled by the federal immigration crackdown.",Anti-ICE protest in Minneapolis spiralled into chaotic scenes on Saturday.

Eight skull fractures, five brain hemorrhages

Calls for probe, political backlash





A 31-year-old Mexican immigrant has alleged that he was brutally beaten by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers during his arrest in Minnesota last month, leaving him with multiple skull fractures and brain hemorrhages.Alberto Castañeda Mondragón told the Associated Press that he was pulled out of a friend’s car outside a shopping centre in St. Paul on January 8 and assaulted without provocation. “They started beating me right away when they arrested me,” he told AP.According to Castañeda Mondragón, officers threw him to the ground, handcuffed him, punched him and struck his head with a steel baton before dragging him into an SUV and transporting him to a detention facility, where he claims the assault continued.“They were very racist people. No one insulted them, neither me nor the other person they detained me with. It was their character, their racism toward us, for being immigrants,” he said.ICE officers have maintained in court documents that he “purposefully ran headfirst into a brick wall” while being detained, a version of events he has strongly denied.“There was never a wall,” he told AP, alleging that officers used an ASP, a telescoping metal baton commonly carried by law enforcement, to hit him.Mondragón, who has no criminal record, said he plans to file a complaint. He told AP that he continues to suffer from memory loss, balance issues and lingering trauma following the incident.When he closes his eyes at night, he said, fear still grips him. “You’re left with the nightmare of going to work and being stopped,” he told AP. “They hit you.”Castañeda Mondragón was later taken to Hennepin County Medical Center, where CT scans revealed fractures to the front, back and sides of his skull. He told AP that doctors informed him he had suffered eight skull fractures and five life-threatening brain hemorrhages.Medical staff who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity reportedly questioned ICE’s claim that his injuries resulted from running into a wall. An outside physician consulted by AP also stated that the pattern of injuries was inconsistent with such an explanation.A federal court declaration filed on January 20 by ICE deportation officer William J. Robinson acknowledged that during intake it was determined Castañeda Mondragón “had a head injury that required emergency medical treatment.”The filing also noted that he had entered the US legally in March 2022 but had overstayed his visa. A federal judge later ruled that his arrest had been unlawful and ordered his release from ICE custody.The case has triggered calls for an investigation from Minnesota elected officials, including Governor Tim Walz, who posted on X: “Law enforcement cannot be lawless. Thousands of aggressive, untrained agents of the federal government continue to injure and terrorize Minnesotans. This must end.”St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and several members of Congress have also sought accountability, according to AP.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees ICE, did not respond to repeated requests for comment from AP. ICE and DHS also did not immediately respond to queries from PEOPLE magazine.","Alberto Castañeda Mondragón, 31, claims he was brutally beaten by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers during his arrest in Minnesota last month.

Floridians seeking a driver’s licence were required to pass the state’s exams entirely in English for the first time in nearly two decades, after the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles implemented an English-only policy that officials said followed a fatal crash involving an illegal immigrant who failed a test 10 times before the accident.The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles announced the policy last week. The rule went into effect Friday and was aimed at “promoting clear communication, understanding of traffic laws, and responsible driving behavior.”Officials said the move was prompted by a deadly crash last summer involving Hardjiner Singh, an illegal immigrant who had obtained a commercial driver’s licence in California. Singh attempted an illegal U-turn with his tractor-trailer, triggering a crash that killed three people, according to New York Post citing officials.State authorities later determined that Singh received his California licence despite failing an English proficiency test. Officials said the incident sparked backlash from public officials and renewed scrutiny of language requirements for commercial drivers.“Good reform by (Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles) to require driver exams be conducted only in English,” Governor Ron DeSantis wrote on X last week.“Need to be able to read the road signs!”The policy also drew criticism from Democrats. Nikki Fried, the former state agriculture commissioner and current chair of the Florida Democratic Party, condemned the change.“In one of the most multilingual states in the country, Florida is going to implement driver’s license exams exclusively in English,” Fried wrote Jan. 30 on X.“This is not about safety, this is about racism.”Authorities said Singh entered the United States illegally in 2018 and was living in California at the time of the crash. Records showed he failed the CDL knowledge exam 10 times in Washington state over a two-month period and twice failed the air brakes exam before ultimately being licensed.Singh was arrested days after the crash in Stockton, Calif., extradited to Florida and charged with three counts of vehicular homicide and three counts of manslaughter. He has pleaded not guilty and was being held without bond in the St. Lucie County Jail.","The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles announced the policy last week.

NEW DELHI: Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday. Toll rose to 36 on Saturday after some critically injured people died in hospitals, said a PTI report.In a related development that has attracted the attention of Indian security establishment, the Islamic State in its latest al-Naba issue called on members of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) to defect and join the Islamic State in Khorasan Province.The claim regarding the blast was issued via IS central's mouthpiece, Amaq, stating the attack was a Fidayeen operation carried out by a soldier of the Islamic State in Pakistan Province (ISPP) -- active since 2019 -- inside the mosque compound. Amaq claimed over 200 casualties in contrast to the official Pak govt admission of 36 deaths and injuries to scores.The suicide bomber was identified by Amaq as Saifullah Ansari. His photograph taking the bayah (oath of allegiance) was also posted by the IS mouthpiece. The statement also mentioned that hundreds of Pakistani Shias had joined the pro-Iran 'Zaynabiyoun brigade' militia in Syria.The claim by Amaq followed an official denial by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which strongly rebutted any involvement in the incident.The blast, which occurred during prayers at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque in Tarlai area, was the deadliest in Islamabad since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing.The explosion coincided with the visit of Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to Pakistan.

'Home-Grown Ills': Islamabad Mosque Blast Triggers Blame Game As India Rejects Pakistan's Blame





The Islamic State on Saturday claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad, which killed at least 36 people and injured many others.In a statement released through its Amaq News Agency, the Islamic State in Pakistan, an offshoot of Daesh, said the bomber opened fire at security guards when they tried to stop him at the entrance and then exploded inside among worshippers.The group also said Shiite Muslims in Pakistan were a target, claiming they provided recruits to militias fighting the Islamic State in Syria.The blast took place on Friday at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque-cum-shrine in the Tarlie area of the capital. The attacker, identified as 32-year-old Yasir from Peshawar, entered the mosque while worshippers were offering weekly prayers and detonated explosives.Authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said they arrested four suspects, including three alleged facilitators and the mastermind, during intelligence-based raids in Peshawar and Nowshera.Investigators said an identity card recovered during the probe confirmed the attacker’s identity. Official records showed his permanent address in Abbas Colony on Charsadda Road in Peshawar.Officials also said the attacker had spent around five months in Afghanistan before the bombing, where he allegedly received training in weapons handling and suicide attacks.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif had earlier claimed that India and Afghanistan were involved in the attack, without presenting any evidence.India had strongly rejected the allegations, saying, ""It is unfortunate that, instead of seriously addressing the problems plaguing its social fabric, Pakistan should choose to delude itself by blaming others for its home-grown ills.

The format of the talks remains unclear, though the official said the main meeting would take place that day.A regional official told Reuters that the priority of the talks was to avoid conflict and de-escalate tensions between Iran and the US, adding that several regional powers had been invited at the foreign ministers’ level.According to the official, countries invited include Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).US outlet Axios, citing two sources and a US official, reported that Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible agreement related to Iran’s nuclear programme.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had instructed Araghchi to pursue “fair and equitable negotiations” in an environment “free from threats and unreasonable expectations”.The talks, he said in posts on X, would be held “within the framework of our national interests”.US President Donald Trump has said he is hopeful Washington would “work something out” with Iran but warned on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal was reached.In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal.”“In return, we expect sanctions to be lifted,” he added, while warning that Iran was prepared for war if talks failed, saying any conflict would likely spread beyond Iran.Turkiye has been leading diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and engaging with regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have assured Tehran that they would not allow their airspace or territory to be used for military action against Iran, while Jordan has said it would not act as a “launching pad” for any such action.","Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States.

A Pakistani anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Tuesday issued non-bailable arrest warrants against Aleema Khan, sister of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan in connection with a protest held in Islamabad in November 2024.According to news agency PTI citing a media report, the warrants were issued by the ATC in Rawalpindi after Aleema Khan failed to appear before the court despite earlier directions.The court also issued non-bailable arrest warrants against her two guarantors and ordered that all three be arrested and produced before it on Wednesday, without fail. Aleema’s application seeking exemption from personal appearance was rejected.The case, registered at Sadiqabad Police Station, relates to a protest at D-Chowk in Islamabad on November 24, 2024 and includes charges of protesting against the government, chanting anti-government slogans, vandalism and stone-pelting. ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah conducted the hearing.The court also issued a show-cause notice to the Superintendent of Police (SP), Rawal, for failing to execute the arrest warrants.The SP has been directed to appear before the court on Wednesday and explain why Aleema Khan was not arrested and presented despite clear orders, according to Pakistani news website Express Tribune.During Monday’s hearing, Aleema Khan’s defence counsel sought a one-day exemption, citing difficulties in travel and daily affairs after her bank accounts, Computerised National Identity Card and passport were reportedly blocked. The court, however, did not accept the plea.The proceedings have drawn attention as Aleema Khan had earlier skipped multiple hearings in the case and appeared only after the court issued property seizure orders and several arrest warrants. She is among those nominated as accused in protest-related cases filed following the November demonstrations.The protest followed Imran Khan’s “final call” for nationwide demonstrations demanding the restoration of the party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) electoral mandate, the release of party leaders and the reversal of constitutional changes.The D-Chowk protest ended on November 26 after a security operation, with several cases registered across Rawalpindi district.

Troops ‘physically handicapped’ by vast terrain

Insurgency background and wider fallout





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country’s security forces are “physically handicapped” by the sheer size of Balochistan as they battle a fresh surge in militant violence, after authorities reported killing 177 insurgents in sweeping counter-terror operations across the province.Addressing the national assembly, Asif described the scale of the challenge facing troops deployed in Pakistan’s largest and least populated province, where coordinated attacks triggered one of the deadliest security crises in recent years. His remarks came after militants launched simultaneous assaults in multiple towns, targeting civilians, homes and security installations.“Balochistan constitutes over 40 per cent of Pakistan geographically...To control it is much more difficult than a populated city, and it needs deployment of massive forces. Our troops are deployed there and are in action against them (terrorists), but they are physically handicapped by guarding and patrolling such a big area,” Asif told lawmakers, as quoted by PTI.Security officials said the death toll of militants had risen to 177 in the past two days following large-scale raids and gun battles.The operations were launched after insurgents carried out coordinated attacks at 12 locations, with authorities confirming that at least 17 police and security personnel were killed, along with dozens of civilians.Asif said the weekend violence claimed 33 civilian lives and 17 members of the security forces. He ruled out talks with the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), saying no negotiations would be held with “terrorists” responsible for killing civilians, including women and children.Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, has long faced a separatist insurgency driven by ethnic Baloch groups who accuse the central government of discrimination and exploitation. Authorities say groups such as the BLA have targeted security forces, infrastructure and projects linked to the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor.Train services between Balochistan and the rest of Pakistan remained suspended for a third day, while mobile and internet services were cut in several districts during clean-up operations. Provincial officials said services were expected to resume once the security situation stabilised.Asif dismissed claims that Balochistan had been neglected, saying the province had seen development, including multiple airports. He also rejected the “missing persons” narrative, alleging that names of militants killed in operations had appeared on such lists. “This narrative has been concocted. I also used to support this cause and protest over it. But, terrorists and criminal elements have hijacked all these narratives,” he said.","Khawaja Asif says security forces are 'physically handicapped' by sheer size of Balochistan.
