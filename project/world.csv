Bengal trying to paint CBI probes as Centre-state row: Govt in SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bengal-trying-to-paint-cbi-probes-as-centre-state-row-govt-in-sc/articleshow/109798700.cms,"NEW DELHI: Stating that it has no administrative and supervisory control over CBI , which is an independent agency, Centre told Supreme Court that West Bengal ’s original suit under Article 131 of the Constitution against it to not allow probe by the agency in the state was not maintainable and is an abuse of legal process.Arguing on maintainability of West Bengal’s petition, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Justices B R Gavai and Sandeep Mehta that the state was attempting to give Centre-state dispute colour to CBI investigations in cases in the state, many of which have been ordered by Calcutta high court.He said Article 131 could be invoked only in case of inter-govt disputes and the grievance of the state in this case was against CBI and not the Union.“Suit is inherently not maintainable at all. The Union and DoPT have nothing to do with registration of cases by CBI, probe and prosecution of a case. We do not have administrative and supervisory power over CBI. I cannot supervise and tell the agency on registration of cases or how to investigate or whether to file closure reports or chargesheet. It is a separate statutory entity, supervised by another statutory body CVC,” Mehta submitted, adding that CBI is not an arm of the govt.Mehta said West Bengal govt had already approached SC challenging HC’s order directing CBI probe in various cases and it should not be allowed to file suit also for redressal of the same grievances, and accused the state for suppressing the fact.Taking note of SG’s submission, the bench asked senior advocate Kapil Sibal on how the state can file suit after it filed appeal against HC order. Sibal said the appeal was filed in individual cases and not on broader jurisdiction issues. Countering Mehta’s contention, Sibal said CVC has supervisory control over CBI only in corruption cases but it is Centre which controls the agency in the rest of the cases. He submitted that ED always followed CBI if it is allowed to probe in the state and it had huge implications on federal structure. He said that law regulating CBI is unique where consent of state was needed which was not the case in case of ED and NIA.The hearing remained inconclusive and would resume next week.",Centre says it has no administrative and supervisory control over CBI. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said state was attempting to give Centre-state dispute colour to CBI investigations in the state. He said Article 131 could be invoked only in case of inter-govt disputes.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109798705,imgsize-48196,width-400,resizemode-4/109798705.jpg"
"At UN debate, India backs full membership of Palestine",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/at-un-debate-india-backs-full-membership-of-palestinian-state/articleshow/109798620.cms,"NEW DELHI: After the US last month vetoed a resolution in the Security Council seeking full membership of the UN for Palestine, India Wednesday backed Palestine’s bid, expressing hope the endeavour will soon get endorsed. Palestine is currently a ``permanent observer state’’ at the UN with no power to vote on resolutions and decisions.A full membership will allow the global body to recognise a Palestinian state .The US, which supports a 2-state solution, had vetoed the resolution in the Council, saying its vote did not reflect opposition to Palestinian statehood, but instead was an acknowledgment that it will only come from direct negotiations between the parties. While the UK and Switzerland had abstained, the 12 remaining members had voted in favour.Participating in a debate on the use of veto, the Indian ambassador, Ruchira Kamboj, noted that Palestine’s application for membership at the UN was not approved by the Security Council because of the US veto.``I would like to state here at the very outset that in keeping with India’s longstanding position, we hope that this would be reconsidered in due course, and that Palestine’s endeavour to become a member of the UN will get endorsed,’’ said Kamboj, while announcing India’s intentions of participating actively in an emergency special session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) on the same issue.The Security Council resolution would have allowed the UNGA, UN’S most widely represented body, to vote for Palestine’s full membership. Israel has said nothing exemplifies the UN’s ``rotten values’’ more than the advancement of a Palestinian statehood.While espousing the Palestinian cause in the UN, India has for long strongly backed the Palestinian application for membership of the UN in the Security Council. India co-sponsored and supported the 2012 resolution in the UNGA on enhancing Palestine’s status from ‘Non-Member Observer Entity’ to ‘Non-Member Observer State’ in the UNGA.In 2011, then PM Manmohan Singh had said in a speech at the UNGA that India was looking forward to ``welcoming Palestine as an equal member of the United Nations’’. The same assurance was given to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas when he visited India next year.The top Indian diplomat at the UN also backed the Security Council’s adoption of resolution 2728 in March demanding an immediate ceasefire for the month of Ramadan. She said it is imperative that humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza is scaled up immediately in order to avert a further deterioration in the situation. ``We urge all parties to come together in this endeavour,’’ she said. While reiterating India’s unequivocal condemnation of the terror attacks in Israel on October 7, Kamboj also underscored that international law and international humanitarian law must be respected by everyone under all circumstances.","The US last month vetoed a resolution in the Security Council seeking full membership of the UN for Palestine.

NewsClick stand on Covid vax ‘terror act’: Cops,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/newsclick-stand-on-covid-vax-terror-act-cops/articleshow/109798166.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police chargesheet filed against NewsClick and its founder, Prabir Purkayastha , has accused him of actively seeking to “undermine the Indian govt’s efforts to develop a vaccine to combat Covid-19”. It claims “the actions were nothing but an act of terror as they aimed at public health, which is one of the touchstones of national security”.Purkayastha has been booked under anti-terror law UAPA.“Evidence gathered during the investigation paints a clear picture of a coordinated campaign to undermine India’s response to Covid-19, driven by a biased agenda and potentially influenced by external entities. Their malicious acts not only endangered the lives of individuals who chose not to get vaccinated due to the misinformation peddled by the accused, but it also threatened the overall public health and safety of the population,” it claims.In a statement, NewsClick said the allegations were completely baseless. “NewsClick and Prabir have not been involved in any terrorist act. Nor is there any evidence for the same. Prabir does not have links to any terrorist group. The timing of these reports makes it clear that they aim to prejudice public opinion and pending judicial proceedings. The chargesheet is nothing but a set of opinions of the investigating officer parading as ‘allegations’. These allegations will be firmly contested,” it said.The chargesheet has a reference to World War III and philosopher Marshall McLuhan, besides claims of a deeper plot to propagate “information warfare” as part of a transnational conspiracy. “The investigation has brought to life McLuhan’s saying that ‘World War III is a guerrilla information war with no division between military and civilian participation’,” the police said while elaborating on Purkayastha's association with China-based millionaire and CCP functionary Neville Roy Singham.According to the chargesheet, the probe revealed a conspiracy aimed at a deliberate creation of a false narrative against Citizen Amendment Act. “The end result of this deliberate misinformation campaign was seen from the beginning of Dec, 2019 and ran up to Feb 2020 in the physical manifestation of the deadly Delhi riots,” it alleges.","Delhi Police chargesheet filed against NewsClick and its founder, Prabir Purkayastha.

KOLKATA: A Raj Bhavan employee on Thursday evening filed a complaint of molestation against Bengal governor C V Ananda Bose, introducing an element of the unprecedented in state politics and pitting the Trinamool govt and the governor’s office in direct conflict in the middle of a seven-phase election season,andThe woman , according to Raj Bhavan insiders, works in the telephone room and stays at the residential quarters on the campus. She first went to the Raj Bhavan police outpost before 7pm Thursday, from where she was taken to Hare Street police station.The governor issued a statement a couple of hours later, saying he would not be “cowed by engineered narratives”.The woman’s complaint to cops mentions two incidents. It says that Bose asked her on April 19 to meet him with her CV. She went to meet him on April 24 at 12.45pm, when he “touched her inappropriately and made untoward advances”, the complaint says. Bose again called her to his office on Thursday but the woman, instead of going alone, asked her supervisor to accompany her. The woman told cops that Bose asked the supervisor to leave after some time, following which he assured her of a promotion and then “touched her cheek”, prompting her to protest.A video in circulation since the evening shows the woman complaining to a senior cop that she had been molested. “This is not the first time that this has happened to me,” she is heard saying on phone before explaining why she had not complained earlier: “I had kept quiet as I was scared of losing my (contractual) job.” She said she felt impelled to complain on Thursday, after the latest incident, to protect others from facing the ordeal she had faced. She is also seen referring to another woman who made similar complaints in the past.Senior cops later toldthey had recorded the woman’s statement but did not register any FIR. “Article 361 of the Constitution insulates the governor from any criminal proceeding while in office,” a senior official explained, adding that legal experts would be consulted on Friday.In its first statement, Raj Bhavan said: “Truth shall triumph. I refuse to be cowed by engineered narratives. If anybody wants some election benefits by maligning me, God bless them. But they cannot stop my fight against corruption and violence in Bengal.” Another statement issued a little later thanked Raj Bhavan staff “who expressed solidarity against derogatory narratives circulated by two disgruntled employees as political parties’ agents”.A third release issued after 10pm banned the entry of cops and Bengal finance minister Chandrima Bhattacharya in Raj Bhavan premises. The statement said cops have been banned to prevent their entry “in the guise of conducting unauthorised, illegitimate, sham and motivated investigations to placate political bosses during election”. The minister’s entry is banned in Raj Bhavan premises in Kolkata, Darjeeling and Barrackpore, but no reason has been attributed.The governor would not attend any finance department event, the statement said, adding that the attorney-general would be consulted for legal steps against Bhattacharya.Before the release of Raj Bhavan order banning her entry, Bhattacharya had condemned “the alleged misconduct by the governor”, which she called “unbecoming of any official, especially the head of State”. She demanded an immediate and a “thorough investigation”.PM Modi reached Raj Bhavan around 10pm, where he stayed the night. He is slated to leave Raj Bhavan Friday morning for campaigning in East Burdwan, Nadia and Birbhum.Earlier, Trinamool launched a blistering attack on Bose on X: “Appalling and unthinkable! The sanctity of Raj Bhavan, a symbol of our constitutionality, has been tarnished. Hours before the PM was supposed to arrive at Raj Bhavan to spend the night, a woman was allegedly molested by the governor under the false pretext of a job. Such despicable behaviour must be condemned in the strongest terms. Justice must be delivered swiftly for the victim, no excuses, no delays!”","A Raj Bhavan employee on Thursday evening filed a complaint of molestation against Bengal governor C V Ananda Bose.

White House

WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden has called Japan and India “xenophobic” countries that do not welcome immigrants , lumping the two with adversaries China and Russia as he tried to explain their economic circumstances and contrasted the four with the US on immigration .The US President made the controversial remark at a campaign fundraising event Wednesday evening.There was no immediate reaction from either the Japanese or Indian governments.Biden’s Xenophobia remark came just three weeks after the White House hosted Japanese PM Fumio Kishida for a lavish official visit, during which the two leaders celebrated what Biden called an “unbreakable alliance ,” particularly on global security matters. Japan is a critical US ally.The White House welcomed PM Narendra Modi for a state visit last summer. And India is a vital partner in the Indo-Pacific despite differences on human rights.At a hotel fundraiser where the donor audience was largely Asian-American, Biden said the upcoming US election was about “freedom, America and democracy” and that the nation’s economy was thriving “because of you and many others”. “Why? Because we welcome immigrants,” Biden said. “Look, think about it. Why is China stalling so badly economically? Why is Japan having trouble? Why is Russia? Why is India? Because they’re xenophobic. They don’t want immigrants.” The president added: “Immigrants are what makes us strong. Not a joke. That’s not hyperbole, because we have an influx of workers who want to be here and want to contribute.”White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Biden was making a broader point about the US posture on immigration. “Our allies and partners know well in tangible ways how Prez Biden values them, their friendship, their cooperation and the capabilities that they bring across the spectrum on a range of issues, not just security related,” Kirby said Thursday when asked about Biden’s “xenophobic” remarks. White House press secretary, Karine Jean Pierre, said, “The broader case that he was trying to make, which most leaders and allies across the globe understand that when it comes to who we are as a nation, we are a nation of immigrants. That is in our DNA. You have heard the prez say it, it makes us better, and we are stronger for it and that is a very important point to know.”",The US President made the controversial remark at a campaign fundraising event Wednesday evening.

"Russia using chemical weapons in Ukraine, says US; Kremlin denies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russia-using-chemical-weapons-in-ukraine-says-us-kremlin-denies/articleshow/109799225.cms,"The US has accused Russia of using chemical weapons , including poison gas, “as a method of warfare” against Ukrainian forces, in violation of a global ban on the use of such weapons.The state department said in a statement on Wednesday that Russia had used chloropicrin , a “choking agent” widely used during World War I, as well as tear gas , against Ukrainian troops.The use of these gases in warfare is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention, an arms control treaty ratified by more than 150 countries, including Russia. “The use of such chemicals is not an isolated incident and is probably driven by Russian forces’ desire to dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions and achieve tactical gains on the battlefield,” the state department said.The state department also said that the US would impose sanctions on three state entities linked to Russia’s chemical and biological weapons programmes and four companies that support them.Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the US, called the accusations that Russian forces had used chemical weapons “odious and unsubstantiated” in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Moscow remained bound by its obligations under the treaty that bans chemical weapons. “As always, such announcements are absolutely unfounded... Russia has been and remains committed to its obligations under international law in this area,” he said.The Ukrainian authorities have reported hundreds of cases of suspected chemical weapons use on the battlefield by Russia since invasion began in Feb 2022. Lt. Col. Artem Vlasiuk, an expert in the Ukrainian army department that deals with nuclear, chemical, biological and radiological security, said that about 250 cases of suspected chemical weapons use by Russian forces had been reported in Feb, about five times the number in March 2023. He said that most of the chemical substances used in the attacks had been identified as CS gas, a tear gas commonly used by riot police to control crowds.Although govts use tear gas for domestic law-enforcement purposes, it is considered a chemical weapon when used in warfare, according to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Civilians can usually escape tear gas during protests, but soldiers in trenches have little choice but to flee under enemy fire or risk being suffocated.Gyunduz Mamedov, Ukraine ’s deputy prosecutor general, said last week that the Russian army had used tear gas against Ukrainian troops at least 900 times in the past six months, with more than 1,400 incidents reported since the start of the war. In addition to tear gas, the state department said that Russian forces had used chloropicrin, a choking agent that irritates the nose, throat and the lungs when inhaled and can cause nausea and vomiting. Ukrainian army officials have said that the chemicals are usually contained in grenades that Russian forces throw at Ukrainian positions, forcing soldiers out of their fortified positions.",The use of these gases in warfare is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention. The state department also said that the US would impose sanctions on three state entities linked to Russia’s chemical and biological weapons programmes.

"Russian troops enter base housing US military in Niger, US official says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russian-troops-enter-base-housing-us-military-in-niger-us-official-says/articleshow/109798716.cms,"WASHINTON: Russian military personnel have entered an air base in Niger that is hosting US troops, a senior US defense official told Reuters, a move that follows a decision by Niger's junta to expel US forces from the country.The military officers ruling the West African nation have told the US to withdraw its nearly 1,000 military personnel from the country, which until a coup last year had been a key partner for Washington's fight against insurgents who have killed thousands of people and displaced millions more.A senior US defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Russian forces were not mingling with US troops but were using a separate hanger at Airbase 101, which is next to Diori Hamani International Airport in Niamey, Niger's capital.The move by Russia 's military puts US and Russian troops in close proximity at a time when the nations' military and diplomatic rivalry is increasingly acrimonious over the conflict in Ukraine.It also raises questions about the fate of US installations in the country following a withdrawal.""(The situation) is not great but in the short-term manageable,"" the official said.The Nigerien and Russian embassies in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The US and its allies have been forced to move troops out of a number of African countries following coups that brought to power groups eager to distance themselves from Western governments. In addition to the impending departure from Niger, US troops have also left Chad in recent days, while French forces have been kicked out of Mali and Burkina Faso.At the same time, Russia is seeking to strengthen relations with African nations, pitching Moscow as a friendly country with no colonial baggage in the continent.Mali, for example, has in recent years become one of Russia's closest African allies, with the Wagner Group mercenary force deploying there to fight jihadist insurgents.Russia has described relations with the United States as ""below zero"" because of US military and financial aid for Ukraine in the war now approaching the end of its second year.The US official said Nigerien authorities had told President Joe Biden's administration that about 60 Russian military personnel would be in Niger, but the official could not verify that number.After the coup, the US military moved some of its forces in Niger from Airbase 101 to Airbase 201 in the city of Agadez. It was not immediately clear what US military equipment remained at Airbase 101.The United States built Airbase 201 in central Niger at a cost of more than $100 million. Since 2018 it has been used to target Islamic State and al Qaeda affiliate Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) fighters with armed drones.Washington is concerned about Islamic militants in the Sahel region, who may be able to expand without the presence of US forces and intelligence capabilities.Niger's move to ask for the removal of US troops came after a meeting in Niamey in mid-March, when senior US officials raised concerns including the expected arrival of Russia forces and reports of Iran seeking raw materials in the country, including uranium.While the US message to Nigerien officials was not an ultimatum, the official said, it was made clear US forces could not be on a base with Russian forces.""They did not take that well,"" the official said.A two-star US general has been sent to Niger to try and arrange a professional and responsible withdrawal.While no decisions have been taken on the future of US troops in Niger, the official said the plan was for them to return to US Africa Command's home bases, located in Germany.",Russian military personnel have entered an air base in Niger that is hosting US troops.

He warned that no attempt to create instability would be tolerated.“Let us all reject negative forces (a reference to critical voices) together and focus on Pakistan’s journey of development and stability,” he said.The Pakistan Supreme Court is currently hearing a case involving accusations levelled by six out of eight Islamabad high court judges of intimidation and interference by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), an organ of the army.The judges provided various examples of alleged interference, including a case concerning Imran Khan, and mentioned incidents where they said their relatives were abducted and tortured, and their homes secretly surveilled to coerce them into delivering favourable judgments.",Pakistan army chief General Asim Munir said on Thursday that the military was “well aware’ of its “constitutional limits” Gen Munir was quoted as talking about constitutional limits at a passing out parade at the Pakistan Air Force Academy in Risalpur.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109795052,imgsize-508829,width-400,resizemode-4/109795052.jpg"

"At least 2,000 people arrested at pro-Palestinian protests on US campuses, AP tally shows",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/at-least-2000-people-arrested-at-pro-palestinian-protests-on-us-campuses-ap-tally-shows/articleshow/109795823.cms,"At least 200 people were arrested at UCLA on Thursday, bringing the nationwide total of arrests to more than 2,000 at dozens of college campuses since police cleared an encampment at Columbia University in mid-April, according to a tally by The Associated Press.Demonstrations - and arrests - have occurred in almost every corner of the nation.But in the last 24 hours, they've drawn the most attention at the University of California, Los Angeles, where chaotic scenes played out early Thursday as officers in riot gear surged against a crowd of demonstrators .Police removed barricades and began dismantling demonstrators' fortified encampment at UCLA after hundreds of protesters defied orders to leave, some forming human chains as police fired flash-bangs to break up the crowds.At least 200 people were arrested at UCLA, said Sgt. Alejandro Rubio of the California Highway Patrol, citing data from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Rubio said the arrestees were being booked at the county jails complex near downtown Los Angeles. UCLA police will determine what if any charges to seek.Workers entered the former encampment site Thursday morning and began an extensive cleanup. Bulldozers scooped up bags of trash and dismantled tents. Some buildings were covered in graffiti.The arrests came after officers spent hours threatening arrests over loudspeakers if people did not disperse.A crowd of more than 1,000 had gathered on campus, including inside a barricaded tent encampment. Protesters and police shoved and scuffled as officers encountered resistance. Video showed police pulling off protesters' helmets and goggles as they were detained.With police helicopters hovering, the sound of flash-bangs - which produce a bright light and a loud noise to disorient and stun - pierced the air.Protesters chanted at the officers, ""Where were you last night?"" Late Tuesday, counterprotesters attack the encampment and the UCLA administration and campus police took hours to respond.Tent encampments of protesters calling on universities to stop doing business with Israel or companies they say support the war in Gaza have spread across campuses nationwide in a student movement unlike any other this century. The ensuing police crackdowns echoed actions decades ago against a much larger protest movement protesting the Vietnam War.They included a college professor from Illinois who said he suffered multiple broken ribs and a broken hand during a pro-Palestine protest on Saturday at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.Bystander video shows the arrest of Steve Tamari, a history professor at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. He seems to be moving in to take video or photos of protesters being detained when multiple officers roughly take him down.Tamari said in a statement Thursday that it was ""a small price to pay for Israel's ongoing genocide in Gaza.""Officials at New York 's Stony Brook University on Long Island said 29 people were arrested early Thursday morning, including students, faculty members and others ""from outside our campus community.""In New York City, Fordham University officials said 15 people were arrested after pushing inside the lobby of a building on the school's campus at Lincoln Center.Seventeen people were arrested on criminal trespass charges Wednesday at the University of Texas at Dallas after demonstrators refused to comply with law enforcement orders to remove an encampment from the school's main walkway, a university spokeswoman said in a statement Thursday.Yale University police arrested four people, including two students, Wednesday night after around 200 demonstrators marched to the school president's home and the campus police department, school officials said. Protesters ignored repeated warnings that they cannot occupy parts of campus without permission, school officials said in a statement Thursday.The protest group Occupy Yale said campus police were violent during the arrests and did not issue warnings. The group posted a video on Instagram showing officers taking one person to the ground and pinning another to a sidewalk.""A peaceful protest,"" Occupy Yale said. ""Police officers seized, pushed, and brutalized people. Is this what you call keeping campus safe?""In Oregon, police began to clear pro-Palestinian rights demonstrators out of the Millar Library at Portland State University, which they have been occupying since Monday.They spray-painted graffiti inside and knocked over or piled up furniture to create barricades. Portland State said on social media Thursday that campus would remain closed because of the police activity.University President Ann Cudd said Wednesday that about 50 protesters vacated the library after administrators promised not to seek criminal charges, expulsion or other discipline if they left peacefully, but others - including non-students - remained. Portland police said Thursday that 15 police vehicles were set on fire overnight; it was not immediately clear if that was related to the protest.University of Minnesota officials meanwhile reached agreement with protesters to end an encampment on the Minneapolis campus. Interim President Jeff Ettinger said in an email Thursday to the campus community that protesters agreed not to disrupt final exams or commencement ceremonies. That followed similar agreements at Northwestern University in suburban Chicago and Brown University in Rhode Island.Meanwhile, Florida's state university chancellor has ordered campus presidents to take whatever steps necessary to prevent disruption of graduation ceremonies, including at large schools such as the University of Florida and Florida State University.Protests also sprung up off campuses. In Albuquerque on Thursday, about two dozen protesters sat in the middle of a roadway blocking access to a main gate at Kirtland Air Force Base. The group waved flags and vowed to ""shut everything down"" over the ongoing war in Gaza.The protests at UCLA appeared to be getting the most attention. Iranian state television carried live images of the police action, as did Qatar's pan-Arab Al Jazeera satellite network. Live images of Los Angeles also played across Israeli television networks.President Joe Biden on Thursday defended the students' right to peaceful protest but decried the disorder of recent days.Israel has branded the protests antisemitic, while Israel's critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, protest organizers - some of whom are Jewish - call it a peaceful movement to defend Palestinian rights and protest the war.California Highway Patrol officers poured into the UCLA campus by the hundreds early Thursday. Wearing face shields and protective vests, they held their batons out to separate them from demonstrators, who wore helmets and gas masks and chanted: ""You want peace. We want justice.""Police methodically ripped apart the encampment's barricade of plywood, pallets, metal fences and dumpsters, then pulled down dozens of canopies and tents. The number of protesters diminished through the morning, some leaving voluntarily with their hands up and others detained by police.The law enforcement presence and continued warnings contrasted with the scene Tuesday night, when counterdemonstrators attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment, throwing traffic cones, releasing pepper spray and tearing down barriers. Fighting between the two sides continued for hours before police stepped in. No one was arrested, but at least 15 protesters were injured. Authorities' tepid response drew criticism from political leaders, Muslim students and advocacy groups.By Wednesday afternoon, a small city sprang up inside the reenforced encampment, with hundreds of people and tents on the quad. Demonstrators rebuilt the makeshift barriers around their tents while state and campus police watched.Some protesters said Muslim prayers as the sun set, while others chanted ""we're not leaving"" or passed out goggles and surgical masks. They wore helmets and headscarves, and discussed the best ways to handle pepper spray or tear gas as someone sang over a megaphone.Outside the encampment, a crowd of students, alumni and neighbours gathered on campus steps, joining in pro-Palestinian chants. A group of students holding signs and wearing T-shirts in support of Israel and Jewish people demonstrated nearby.The crowd grew as the night wore on as more and more officers poured onto campus.Ray Wiliani, who lives nearby, said he came to UCLA on Wednesday evening to support the pro-Palestinian demonstrators.""We need to take a stand for it,"" he said. ""Enough is enough.""California Gov. Gavin Newsom denounced the delayed law enforcement response on Tuesday and UCLA Chancellor Gene Block promised an investigation. The head of the University of California system, Michael Drake, ordered an ""independent review of the university's planning, its actions and the response by law enforcement.""""The community needs to feel the police are protecting them, not enabling others to harm them,"" Rebecca Husaini, chief of staff for the Muslim Public Affairs Council, said during a news conference Wednesday.Meanwhile, police cleared protest encampments at schools across the US, resulting in arrests, or were closed up voluntarily. In New York, those included the City College of New York, Fordham University, Stony Brook University and the University of Buffalo. Others nationwide included the University of New Hampshire in Durham, Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, and Tulane University in New Orleans.On Tuesday night, police burst into a building occupied by war protesters at Columbia University, breaking up a demonstration that had paralyzed the school.Columbia's chapter of the American Association of University Professors condemned the school's leadership on Thursday for asking New York police to remove the protesters. The chapter said ""the horrific police attack on our students"" is now ""shamefully on view for the whole world to see.""At the University of Wisconsin in Madison, a scrum broke out early Wednesday after police with shields removed all but one tent and shoved protesters. Four officers were injured. Four people were charged with battering law enforcement.The nationwide campus demonstrations began at Columbia on April 17 to protest Israel's offensive in Gaza, following Hamas' deadly attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. Militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took roughly 250 hostages. Vowing to stamp out Hamas, Israel has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the Health Ministry there.US college campuses have become a flashpoint, with school leaders facing intense scrutiny over their handling of allegations of antisemitism and the right to free speech. The presidents of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania resigned following questions at a congressional hearing about whether calls on campus for the genocide of Jews would violate the school's conduct policy.","At least 200 people were arrested at UCLA on Thursday, bringing the nationwide total of arrests to more than 2,000.

How police took down the UCLA protest camp,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-police-took-down-the-ucla-protest-camp/articleshow/109792635.cms,"LOS ANGELES: As protesters chanted and sprayed fire extinguishers at them, police officers moved in on the pro-Palestinian encampment at UCLA in the early hours of Thursday, tearing down its barricades, arresting dozens of people and clearing out the tents that had dominated the center of campus for days.The chaotic scenes were part of a tense, hourslong back-and-forth between protesters and police that had been building after violent clashes a day earlier — involving counterprotesters who attacked the encampment — prompted administrators to call in law enforcement.On Wednesday night, authorities issued a warning to pro-Palestinian demonstrators : Leave the encampment outside Royce Hall or face arrest.As the night wore on, officers in riot gear tried to approach the encampment through one of its entrances but were turned back several times.Demonstrators appeared to try several tactics to fend them off. At one point, they blocked an entrance with wooden pallets and homemade shields. They surrounded police officers, chanting “Free, free Palestine!” and “Peaceful protest!” At another point, they opened umbrellas and began flashing lights and taking photos of the police officers.Then, around 3 a.m. Thursday, officers breached one of the barricades at the encampment and began to pull apart plywood and other materials that demonstrators had used to build a wall. Some demonstrators sprayed fire extinguishers in response, briefly forcing some officers to fall back.But an hour into the raid, the encampment’s main barricade had been dismantled. A line of students linking arms took its place.Officers gave another dispersal warning to protesters. They corralled those who refused to leave and began arresting them, zip-tying their wrists and leading them away from the encampment.Police pulled up tents — one removed a Palestinian flag and tossed it aside — and at several points fired devices at demonstrators. It was not clear what the officers were using, but Erik Larsen, an officer for the California Highway Patrol, said in a telephone interview that its officers were equipped with a variety of “nonlethal” tools, including flash-bang devices.By dawn, the camp had been cleared of all but a final group of demonstrators, some of whom chanted, “We’ll be back, and we’ll be stronger — you cannot ignore us any longer.” Some were detained and marched away with their hands zip-tied behind their back.The CHP — which, in addition to patrolling state highways is responsible for safekeeping state property, including public universities such as UCLA — said that 132 demonstrators had been arrested and would be handed over to the university’s police department. At least 250 CHP officers were involved in clearing the encampment, Larsen said.Other law enforcement agencies, including the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department and the UCLA police, were also on the scene, he said.","The California Highway Patrol said 132 demonstrators had been arrested and would be handed over to the university’s police department.

The case, which has shocked the nation, centers around a disturbing video that emerged during the trial, revealing harrowing details of alleged child abuse .Appearing in court on Tuesday, Gregor stands accused of forcing Corey to run on a treadmill, purportedly because the child was deemed ""too fat."" If convicted, Gregor could face a life sentence behind bars, according to a report from NY Post.The Superior Court in Ocean City was shown surveillance footage depicting Gregor compelling Corey to run on the treadmill, despite the child's repeated falls due to the machine's excessive speed. The incident occurred on March 20, 2021, at the Atlantic Heights Clubhouse fitness centre.In the video obtained by CourtTV.com, Gregor is seen adjusting the treadmill's settings, pushing the limits of the machine as Corey struggles to keep pace. The distressing footage captures the child falling multiple times, with Gregor forcefully placing him back on the moving track, even appearing to bite Corey's head at one point.The emotional toll of the trial was evident as Corey's mother, Bre Micciolo, took the stand, tearfully watching the horrifying events unfold on screen.Disturbingly, days before Corey's tragic death, Bre Micciolo had reported her son's injuries to the New Jersey Division of Child Protection and Permanency, urging Gregor to seek medical attention for their son. Corey reportedly revealed to doctors that his father made him run on the treadmill because he was ""too fat.""Tragically, Corey's health deteriorated rapidly, and on April 2, 2021, he was rushed to the hospital after exhibiting alarming symptoms, including stumbling, slurred speech, and respiratory distress. Despite medical efforts, Corey succumbed to his injuries.An initial autopsy attributed Corey's death to blunt force injuries, with subsequent investigations revealing a pattern of chronic abuse. A forensic pathologist, Dr. Thomas Andrew, concluded that Corey had suffered from acute traumatic injuries, ultimately leading to his demise.Gregor's arrest in July 2021 on child neglect charges was followed by further scrutiny, culminating in his arrest on March 9, 2022, for Corey's death. Despite being offered a 30-year plea deal, Gregor remains in custody at the Ocean City Jail, awaiting trial without bond.","Christopher Gregor, 31, is on trial for the suspected killing of his 6-year-old son Corey Micciolo.

The pre-action letter sent on Monday outlines his civil claim for damages for harassment abroad, physical injury, trespass to the person, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.“While in office, Shahzad highlighted army and ISI interference with his accountability and anti-corruption objectives. Believing that he could not fix the rampant corruption in Pakistan, he resigned from Khan’s government in Jan 2022,” a spokesperson for UK law firm Leigh Day, which is representing Akbar, said. On April 17, 2022, he fled to London.“He continues to campaign against corruption in Pakistan and remains highly critical of the military establishment and govt officials,” the spokesperson added.Akbar said: “Compared to what was done to me, I believe a lot worse is being inflicted on dissidents in Pakistan by the current regime. They are targeting political workers, lawyers, judges andjournalists. However, what should be most alarming is that Pakistan is able to target its dissidents on British soil without any accountability.”A spokesperson for Hertfordshire constabulary confirmed to TOI it was investigating the acid attack and was appealing for witnesses and to trace the motorbike the suspects rode. No arrests have been made.The Pakistan high commission in London said: “The govt rejects all such attempts to malign the reputation of its institutions for motivated agendas.”A spokesperson for the Pakistan ministry of foreign affairs said last Dec, when asked about the attack: “We reject any insinuations of Pakistan's involvement and that of Pakistani agencies in such a heinous attack. It is not our policy to target our own nationals abroad. We hope that culprits in this case will be identified and treated as per UK law.”","Shahzad Akbar (46), a Pakistani citizen who fled to Britain after Khan was ousted, was nearly blinded in the attack in front of his young child at their home in Royston, Hertfordshire.

Who is responsible for this?""Rehman, while taking a veiled jibe at Pakistan 's Army, claimed that hidden forces are pulling the strings behind the scenes, making elected officials mere puppets.""There are powers behind the walls controlling us, and they make decisions while we are just puppets,"" he asserted, casting doubt on the legitimacy of the current parliament and accusing its members of compromising their principles and ""selling democracy .""The opposition leader expressed his concerns about the state of representation in Pakistan, questioning whether the parliament truly reflects the people's will.

It is not an admirable step because, at this serious juncture of our national life and the lowest point of our economic condition, we should be focusing on substantive issues rather than taking trivial and inconsequential decisions,"" The News quoted Mehboob as saying.Meanwhile, lawyer Abdul Moiz Jaferii highlighted the absence of any pretence of law or order in the notification regarding Dar's appointment on the said post.However, Supreme Court Advocate Basil Nabi Malik is of the view that Article 90(2) of the Constitution does allow the prime minister to act either directly or through his federal ministers.",The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) came down heavily against the Shehbaz Sarif- led government over the appointment of Ishaq Dar as Deputy PM.

Gen. Mao Phalla said the soldiers were transferring ammunition from trucks into a storage facility when the blast occurred, killing them instantly. He said another 11 people, including soldiers and nearby villagers, were slightly injured, mostly from debris from the damaged buildings, not shrapnel.Cambodia held a mass funeral on Sunday for those killed in the explosion.The initial but still not official theory was that the soldiers were unloading ammunition from a truck and stacking it on the ground before moving it into the storage facility, causing one item to explode, he said. That set off a chain reaction, added Mao Phalla.However, he said it will be difficult to determine the exact chain of events as all those involved in the unloading were killed.Mao Phalla said the site has been sealed off and that deminers from theCambodian Mines Action Center were clearing the area any unexploded ordnance.In March 2005, a nighttime blast at an arms depot in the northwestern provincial town of Battambang triggered an hourslong spray of shells and bullets that killed at least six people and caused panic.A 2014 report by the Swiss-based group Small Arms Survey highlighted the dangers of poorly stored or mishandled munitions, calling it a ""global problem.""

Five people died trying to make the crossing last week.Human rights charities and unions opposed to the policy are expected to launch fresh legal challenges to stop the flights from taking off after the UK Supreme Court declared the policy unlawful last year.Images released by Britain's interior ministry on Wednesday showed a man being put in a van by immigration enforcement officials, and another being led out of his house in handcuffs.""Our dedicated enforcement teams are working at pace to swiftly detain those who have no right to be here so we can get flights off the ground,"" interior minister James Cleverly said in a statement on Wednesday.Care4Calais, a refugee charity, said the detentions had started on Monday.A spokesperson said that the group's helpline had received calls from ""tens of people"", adding that they still did not know who would be earmarked for the first deportation flight, or when it would be attempted.","British authorities have started to detain migrants in preparation for them to be sent to Rwanda in the next nine to 11 weeks.

Rare editions of Pushkin are vanishing from libraries around Europe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/rare-editions-of-pushkin-are-vanishing-from-libraries-around-europe/articleshow/109799385.cms,"PARIS: In April 2022, soon after Russia invaded Ukraine, two men arrived at the library of the University of Tartu, in Estonia’s second-largest city. They told the librarians they were Ukrainians fleeing war and asked to consult 19th-century first editions of works by Alexander Pushkin, Russia’s national poet, and Nikolai Gogol. Speaking Russian, they said they were an uncle and nephew researching censorship in czarist Russia so the nephew could apply for a US scholarship.Eager to help, the librarians obliged. They spent 10 days studying the books.Four months later, during a routine annual inventory, the library discovered that eight books the men had consulted had disappeared, replaced with facsimiles of such high quality that only expert eyes could detect them. At first, it seemed like a one-off — bad luck at a provincial library. It wasn’t. Police are now probing what they believe is a vast, coordinated series of thefts of rare 19th-century Russian books — primarily first and early editions of Pushkin — from libraries across Europe.Since 2022, more than 170 books valued at more than $2.6 million, according to Europol, have vanished from the National Library of Latvia in Riga; Vilnius University Library; the State Library of Berlin; the Bavarian State Library in Munich; the National Library of Finland in Helsinki; the National Library of France; university libraries in Paris and Lyon in France, and Geneva; and from the Czech Republic. The University of Warsaw library in Poland was hardest hit, with 78 books gone.The books are worth tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars each. In most cases, the originals were replaced with high-quality copies that mimicked even their foxing — a sign of a sophisticated operation. The disappearance of so many books of the same ilk from so many countries in a relatively short period is unprecedented, experts said. The thefts have led libraries to boost security.According to Europol, authorities have arrested nine people in connection to the thefts. Four were detained in Georgia in late April, along with more than 150 books. In Nov, French police placed three suspects into custody. Another man has been convicted in Estonia and a fifth suspect is in jail in Lithuania. A special French police unit dedicated to fighting cultural theft is overseeing the investigation in France and coordinating across Europe. Authorities paint a picture of a network of associates, some blood relatives, travelling across Europe by bus with library cards sometimes under assumed names to scout rare Russian books, make high-quality copies, then swap them for the originals, case files reveal. The probe has been dubbed “Operation Pushkin”.Prices of books published during the lifetimes of the holy trinity of Russian romantic writers — Pushkin, Gogol and Mikhail Lermontov — have risen dramatically in the past 20 years, in line with the rise in wealth of Russian collectors. Western sanctions put in place after Russia invaded Ukraine prohibit dealers in the West from selling to residents of Russia, fuelling an existing shadow market for rare books. Europol said that some of the stolen books had already been sold by auction houses in Moscow and St Petersburg, Russia, “effectively making them irrecoverable”.","Since 2022, more than 170 books valued at more than $2.6 million have vanished from libraries across Europe.
