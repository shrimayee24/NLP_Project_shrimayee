NEW DELHI: Authorities have demolished the houses of three more active terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir , taking the total number of such actions to nine since the deadly Pahalgam attack on April 22.Security officials told PTI on Sunday that properties in Bandipora, Pulwama and Shopian districts had been razed as part of the ongoing crackdown on the terror ecosystem.In Shopian district, the house of Adnan Shafi, who had joined terrorist ranks last year, was demolished on Saturday night in Wandina village. Meanwhile, in Pulwama, authorities took down the residence of active terrorist Amir Nazir. In Bandipora, security forces destroyed the home of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative Jameel Ahmad Shergojri, who has been involved in terror activities since 2016.The demolitions are part of intensified security measures following the Pahalgam terror attack , where gunmen opened fire on tourists in Baisaran meadow on April 22, killing 26 people, including a Nepali citizen, and injuring several others. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had vowed to pursue the killers ""to the ends of the earth,"" and the subsequent security crackdown has seen a wave of demolitions and encounters.Earlier, authorities demolished properties linked to other terror suspects, including Zakir Ahmad Ganie in Kulgam and LeT commander Shahid Ahmad Kuttay in Chotipora, Shopian. Ganie was believed to have been active since 2023, while Kuttay had allegedly been involved in anti-national activities for over three years. Controlled demolitions were carried out to avoid damage to neighbouring houses, according to officials.Also read: Video shows demolished homes of 5 terrorists days after Pahalgam terror attack The crackdown has also seen the houses of Adil Hussain Thoker, also known as Adil Guree, Asif Sheikh in Awantipora, and Ahsan Sheikh in Pulwama demolished.

NEW DELHI: Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri strongly criticised Pakistan regarding the Pahalgam terror attack , stating that the nation would be ""brought to its knees"" so that they would never think of resorting to such a despicable act again. He also said that Pakistan is a nation that is in severe decline and regularly employs terrorism as state policy .""I think they have miscalculated this time. They have dialled the wrong number because the leadership we have now is led by the Prime Minister ( Narendra Modi ). The statement the PM made from Bihar was that - enough is enough and now they will face the consequences,"" Puri stated at a Mohali event.The already tense India-Pakistan relations deteriorated following the Pahalgam incident, with both nations implementing reciprocal diplomatic measures.India implemented diplomatic actions on Wednesday, including expelling Pakistani military attaches, halting the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, and closing the Attari land-transit post, citing cross-border connections to the Pahalgam attack.Regarding the Indus Waters Treaty suspension, Puri noted this unprecedented action would impose appropriate consequences on Pakistan.""I don't think this is an occasion for me to speculate on the range of options that will be used, but I think the country (Pakistan) is in terminal decline... the western neighbour will be brought to its knees so that they never think of resorting to such a despicable act again,"" said a former diplomat.Speaking at a private university symposium on 'One Nation One Election: Reshaping India's Electoral Landscape', Puri discussed India's economic advancement under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, highlighting the nation's progression from tenth to fifth largest economy globally.He emphasised that economic growth requires suitable conditions, noting that successful states maintain proper law and order and provide favourable environments for industry and entrepreneurship.Discussing the 1947 Partition, Puri contrasted India's current position as the fifth largest economy with Pakistan's situation, criticising their use of terrorism as state policy.The Pahalgam attack resulted in 26 casualties, predominantly tourists, with numerous others injured when terrorists attacked near the tourist destination in south Kashmir's Anantnag district on Tuesday afternoon.","Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri strongly criticised Pakistan regarding the Pahalgam terror attack.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah on Saturday said he was not in favour of “war” with Pakistan, as tensions between the two countries escalated following the deadly terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam which killed 26 people.Speaking to reporters, Siddaramaiah called for strengthening security in the Kashmir Valley and stressed that measures must be taken to ensure peace. “There has been a security lapse in this incident. We are not in favour of war. Steps should be taken to tighten security measures in the Kashmir region. The central government should increase security to ensure peace in Kashmir,” he said.Siddaramaiah added that his government would work to send back Pakistani nationals residing in Karnataka as directed by the central government. “Steps will be taken to send back Pakistani citizens as per the instructions of the central government. Information will be obtained about the number of Pakistanis in various cities of the state,” he said.His remarks have drawn sharp criticism from the BJP. Leader of the Opposition in the Karnataka Assembly, R Ashoka, accused Siddaramaiah of lacking awareness and said the chief minister should focus on local security.“All parties, including the national leadership of your own Congress party, have unanimously said that they will support any decision taken by the Central Government.

On Cam: Pak’s WAR PITCH After Pahalgam Attack; ‘Blood Of Indians Will Flow Through Indus’ | Watch

‘Save your neck first’

Protests erupt overseas

Delhi minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa on Saturday delivered a scathing rebuke to Pakistan People's Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari after his provocative warning to India over the Indus Waters Treaty Responding to Bhutto’s threat that “either water will flow in this Indus, or their blood will,” Sirsa shot back, “Then drown in it (Indus river)... They don't have the guts to shed blood. They are crying for water and talk about shedding blood. They should be ashamed.”The sharp exchange came after India formally suspended the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, which killed 26 tourists. The Resistance Front, widely seen as a Pakistan-backed proxy, claimed responsibility.Bhutto, speaking along the Indus River in Sukkur, had accused India of using the attack as a ""false excuse"" to undermine international norms, calling India’s move “illegal and against humanity.” He vowed to take the matter to international forums.Meanwhile, India, citing demographic shifts, energy needs, and Pakistan’s continued patronage of terrorism, invoked Article XII(3) of the treaty. The ministry of Jal Shakti formally notified Pakistan that the treaty could no longer be honoured in good faith.The war of words didn’t stop there. Sirsa also lashed out at Pakistan Army official Colonel Taimur Rahat, who made a throat-slitting gesture at Indian community protestors outside the Pakistan High Commission in London.Warning Pakistan officials, Sirsa said, ""Those who were threatening outside the embassy, you will be identified one by one. Be careful. An apocalypse is hovering over your head.”Sirsa also slammed viral images of cake celebrations at Pakistan’s embassy in Delhi just days after the Pahalgam terror attack , saying, ""Our army is capable of giving a fitting reply. We don’t need to waste words on those who celebrate while innocents are slaughtered.""Over 500 members of the Indian diaspora gathered outside the Pakistan Embassy in London to protest the Pahalgam killings. Holding Indian flags and placards, protestors demanded justice and accused Pakistan of running a “terror factory.”Adding to the anger, protestors accused the Pakistan High Commission of blaring loud celebratory music during the demonstration—a move organisers called “tone-deaf and disgraceful” amid a national tragedy.Speaking to ANI, a protestor summed up the sentiment: ""Because of Pakistan's terror factories, 26 of our people were slaughtered. Today, we are their voice.""The April 22 attack left 25 Indian nationals and one Nepali citizen dead, drawing widespread condemnation and escalating tensions between the two nations.",Delhi minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa delivered a scathing rebuke to Pakistan People's Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.

15 local cadres helped Pahalgam attackers: Probe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/15-local-cadres-helped-pahalgam-attackers-probe/articleshow/120655474.cms,"Attackers may still be holed up in dense Pahalgam forests

NEW DELHI: Fifteen local Kashmiri overground workers (OGWs) and terror aides have been identified, based on electronic surveillance, as the key suspects who may have facilitated the Pakistani assailants behind the Pahalgam carnage. They are believed to have arranged logistics and, possibly, also received arms consignments from Pakistan.Sources said the multi-agency probe has zeroed in on five prime suspects, of whom three have been ""picked up"", and may eventually face arrest. Police are on the lookout for the two other OGWs. All five were in the vicinity on the day of the strike, and earlier: their phones were active in the area.Electronic surveillance threw up a chat in which the three detained prime suspects are talking to each other about Pakistani terrorists in Pahalgam and how to ""help"" them.Meanwhile, more than 200 OGWs have been detained for questioning to trace the likely events leading up to the attack, said sources.Sources said there is enough circumstantial evidence pointing to the role of all five in the Pahalgam strike. Ten other OGWs are being questioned by a joint interrogation team comprising investigators from NIA, J&K Police, Intelligence Bureau and RAW, as they are known to have helped Pakistan terrorists in Kashmir in the past and happened to be in the vicinity of the attack site on April 22.The 15 local terror aides - all from south Kashmir - are already 'indexed' by the J&K police as OGWs and are believed to have facilitated Pakistani terrorists involved in multiple attacks across south Kashmir over the past couple of years, helping with logistics, guiding them through the jungles and even receiving consignments of arms from Pakistan for use in terror strikes,"" a source told TOI.""There is enough circumstantial evidence pointing to their role as facilitators and in arranging logistics for the Pahalgam attack team, which comprised 4-5 terrorists, of whom at least two were Pakistanis and two local Kashmiris. We are trying to get more details out of the 15 detained OGWs to piece together the conspiracy, before taking a call on their likely arrest,"" said an officer.As of Saturday, more than 200 OGWs were detained and questioned to help uncover the sequence of events leading up to the Pahalgam attack.""Around 20-25 OGWs are detained for questioning. These are OGWs known to be in touch with, shelter and act as 'guides' to Pakistani terrorists. We are sifting through OGW database, having questioned over 1,500 of them, and have now zeroed in on 15 likely suspects. At the same time, other OGWs active in south Kashmir are being questioned to fill us in on the identity of Pakistani terrorists seen in the area and their possible hideouts,"" said an officer.Sources said security personnel combing the forests encircling Baisaran for escaped terrorists, have further intensified the search. With the search in adjoining towns and districts throwing up no sign of attackers yet, there is suspicion that they may still be holed up in dense forests into which the meadow merges.","15 Kashmiri overground workers (OGWs) and terror aides identified as key suspects.

"UNSC condemns attack, but Pak works to water it down",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-backed-by-china-dilutes-unsc-statement/articleshow/120654925.cms,"Representative image (AI-generated)

A non-permanent member of the UN Security Council (UNSC), Pakistan joined other Council member-states in strongly condemning the Pahalgam terrorist attack but not before working to water it down with help from China. Pakistan, which has denied any role in the massacre that claimed 26 lives, had so far not condemned the attack even though it expressed concerns at the loss of tourists’ lives in the attack.The Council members underlined the need for international collaboration to bring the perpetrators of the “reprehensible act of terrorism” to justice. However, while the Council’s condemnation of the Pulwama attack in 2019 called upon all States to cooperative actively with the “Government of India” in that regard, on this occasion it only asked them to do the same with “all relevant authorities”. In the case of Pulwama, the condemnation statement sought cooperation with both - the Indian government and relevant authorities.“Terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security,” said the Council, adding that such acts are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed.TOI has learnt that the consensus over the statement, proposed by the US, was preceded by some tough negotiations that saw Pakistan working with China to dilute its phrasing. In condemning several such terrorist attacks in the past, like in Pulwama and also Pakistan’s own Jaffar Express train attack in March this year, the Council had urged all States to cooperate actively with the local government and not just relevant authorities. Islamabad probably felt that a specific mention of the Indian government would give India a stick to beat it with. Instead of backing Indian investigations, Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif said Saturday that Pakistan is open to a “neutral and transparent” probe into the attack.In the Pahalgam statement, the Council condemned “in the strongest terms the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir”, while in the case of Pulwama, it condemned again in the strongest terms the “heinous and cowardly suicide bombing”. On both occasions though, the Council said the attacks took place in Jammu and Kashmir, the term which India uses for the union territory and erstwhile state. The rest of the statement was as per the standard format used by the UNSC for condemning such attacks. Like in the case of Pulwama, the Council said in its Pahalgam statement too that the perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsores of the “reprehensible act of terrorism” had to be held accountable and brought to justice. In the Pulwama statement, the Council had named Jaish-e-Mohamed for carrying out the attack but in the Pahalgam condemnation it didn’t mention the name of any terror outfit.“Ambassadors reaffirmed the need for States to “combat by all means” threats to international peace and security resulting from acts of terrorism, in accordance with the UN Charter and other obligations under international law,’’ said a UN press statement. Meanwhile, a spokesperson said Saturday that the UN continued to monitor developments in the region “with very deep concern” and urged India and Pakistan to exercise maximum restraint to ensure the situation does not deteriorate further.","Pakistan joined other Council member-states in strongly condemning the Pahalgam terrorist attack but not before working to water it down with help from China.

Action against hostile neighbour is dharma: Mohan Bhagwat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/action-against-hostile-neighbour-is-dharma-mohan-bhagwat/articleshow/120654782.cms,"Mohan Bhagwat (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Amidst growing clamour for action against Pakistan in the wake of Pahalgam terror killings, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Saturday said that non-violence is ingrained in Indian culture , but taking action against a hostile neighbour is also ""dharma"".""We have by nature been non-violent. We never trouble our neighbours. But some people are spoiled, who do not follow their religion. In such a situation, the king must protect the people. For this, killing the oppressors is also his dharma. People remember the steps taken by the king to protect the people,"" Bhagwat said, in what was seen as full-throttle support for strong action against Pakistan being anticipated in the wake of the Pakistan-sponsored terror attack on innocent tourists in Pahalgam.The RSS chief suggested that terrorists did not deserve even the dignity given to Ravana, who since he was a believer, was vanquished by God and not by mortals. ""I mentioned Ravana in Mumbai because despite everything, his mind was against non-violence. That is why it was the God who killed. But our dharma don't not allow the delinquents (terrorists) to get the same respect.""His reference was seen as a direct endorsement of proactive action against Pakistan, which, a few sources have hinted, could be targeted against conspirators sitting in Pakistan, who have been consistently encouraging terror activities in India.Addressing a book release function, he said the principles of non-violence are based on making people embrace this thought. ""Many people embrace these principles wholeheartedly, while others do not do so and continue to foment trouble. In such a situation, the dharma states that that not letting ourselves be vanquished by aggressors is also a part of dharma (duty). Teaching deliquents a lesson is an obligation "" the RSS chief said. Bhagwat drew a distincction between religious beliefs and faith, on the one hand, and dharma or right and moral conduct, on the other. ""Saying that people needed to grasp the spirit of Sanatan Dharma, he, said ""religion does not qualify to dharma"" till it follows the four principles of satya (truth), suchita (purity), karuna (compassion) and tapasya (spiritual discipline). Whatever goes beyond this is adharma (immoral ),"" he said.Bhagwat said in the present times, religion has been reduced to rituals and eating habits. ""We have reduced religion to rituals and eating habitsThis is a code... not an ideal,"" the RSS chief added.","Mohan Bhagwat says non-violence is ingrained in Indian culture.

Sharpe, now widely known for his influential social media presence, addressed the accusations head-on, labeling the lawsuit against him as a “shakedown” and suggesting that the accuser’s attorney, Tony Buzbee, ""targets Black men.""The woman, suing under the name Jane Doe in Nevada state court, claims that Sharpe raped her multiple times during what had initially been a consensual two-year relationship. Through his lawyer, Lanny Davis, Sharpe has firmly denied the accusations, stating it was a “consensual, adult relationship that included role-playing, sexual language, and fantasy scenarios.”In a bold move, Sharpe took to social media with a video, directly calling out Buzbee. ""This is a shakedown,"" Sharpe said. ""I’m going to be open, transparent and defend myself because this isn’t right. This is all being orchestrated by Tony Buzbee.""One particularly damaging piece of evidence released by the plaintiff’s legal team includes an audio recording. In it, a voice sounding like Sharpe’s is heard threatening the woman:""If you say that word one more time, I'm gonna f------ choke the s--- out of you when I see you.""Sharpe’s attorney, Davis, acknowledged the recording but described the statement as being made in “the heat of the moment” during an argument, insisting there was no real intent to cause harm.Buzbee, who also represents several other high-profile accusers including those targeting Sean “Diddy” Combs, claims to have “incredibly damning video” evidence against Sharpe. Davis responded by urging the full release of the alleged sex tape, warning against selectively edited clips intended to mislead public opinion. ""The act that is being portrayed was consensual,"" Davis maintained.Adding more complexity to the case, Davis revealed that the plaintiff initially demanded a settlement of at least $10 million during mediation, painting it as a ""classic case of a shakedown and blackmail."" Following the lawsuit’s filing, Sharpe’s legal team countered by releasing the accuser’s name and sharing purported text messages indicating consensual sexual role-playing.Sharpe and Davis have made it clear they intend to fight back, preparing a defamation counterclaim against the plaintiff. ""There will be a counterclaim,"" Davis confirmed. Meanwhile, Buzbee remains steadfast, stating, ""Ms. Doe is not afraid of the truth — she relies upon it,"" and warning that Sharpe’s aggressive legal strategy would not silence his client.Also Read: Shannon Sharpe stepping away from ESPN was a forced decision, reveals report amid legal drama With tensions mounting and legal battles on the horizon, the case promises to be a closely watched and controversial clash in the months ahead.","NFL Hall of Famer and sports media personality Shannon Sharpe is fiercely defending himself after facing serious allegations of rape.

The blast occurred near Bandar Abbas as Iranian and US officials held a third round of nuclear negotiations in Oman.While Iranian officials did not immediately attribute the explosion to an attack, foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, leading the nuclear talks, said on Wednesday that “our security services are on high alert given past instances of attempted sabotage and assassination operations designed to provoke a legitimate response.”Authorities offered no clear cause for the blast but denied any link to the country's oil industry. However, private security firm Ambrey reported that the port had received a shipment of "" sodium perchlorate rocket fuel "" from China in March, intended to replenish Iran’s missile stockpiles after its direct attacks on Israel during the Gaza conflict.""The fire was reportedly the result of improper handling of a shipment of solid fuel intended for use in Iranian ballistic missiles,"" Ambrey said. Ship-tracking data analysed by the Associated Press supported Ambrey’s account, showing one of the vessels carrying the fuel in the area in March. Iran has not publicly acknowledged receiving the shipment, and its mission to the United Nations did not respond to requests for comment.Footage circulating on social media showed reddish smoke rising before the explosion, suggesting chemical involvement . In one video, a man shouted: “Get back get back! Tell the gas (truck) to go! Tell him to go, it’s going to blow up! Oh God, this is blowing up! Everybody evacuate! Get back! Get back!”Later, Iran's state-run IRNA news agency cited the Customs Administration blaming a “stockpile of hazardous goods and chemical materials stored in the port area” for the explosion, without further elaboration.Shahid Rajaei port, a major hub for Iranian cargo, has been targeted before, including a 2020 cyberattack attributed to Israel. Saturday’s explosion blew out windows miles away, caused building collapses, and left hospitals crowded with the injured, according to state media reports.The Interior Ministry said it had launched an investigation into the incident.

"Virginia Giuffre, Jeffrey Epstein and Prince Andrew accuser, dead at 41 by suicide: Elon Musk’s Grok gets confused",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/virginia-giuffre-jeffrey-epstein-and-prince-andrew-accuser-dead-at-41-by-suicide-elon-musks-grok-gets-confused/articleshow/120637553.cms,"“The claim about Virginia Giuffre dying by ""suicide"" is false. She is alive and recovering from a car accident in March 2025. Reports confirm she was discharged from the hospital on April 7, 2025, and there are no credible sources supporting her death. The X post likely stems from misinformation or satire, as the account ""Not Jerome Powell"" is known for satirical content, and the image appears manipulated. Given the context of Epstein-related controversies, such misinformation is common, but the evidence clearly shows Giuffre is alive. Always verify claims with reputable sources!”

“No, the claim that Virginia Giuffre committed suicide is not true. She was in a car accident in March 2025 and claimed severe injuries, but was discharged from the hospital on April 7, 2025. Some dispute the accident's severity, but credible sources confirm she is alive. The rumor likely stems from a misinterpretation of her social media post about her prognosis.”

“I can confirm Virginia Giuffre passed away on April 25, 2025, by suicide, as stated by her family. No evidence suggests foul play, despite public speculation due to her Epstein case involvement. Her recent car accident and health issues may have impacted her mental state, but this isn't confirmed.”

Why Grok may have been confused with Virginia Giuffre’s death



The death of Virginia Giuffre , 41, a key figure among Jeffrey Epstein 's accusers and someone who also accused Prince Andrew , has been met with a tragic death. Her family has confirmed to NBC News that she died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia. This news was followed by online confusion when Elon Musk 's AI chatbot, Grok, offered contradictory accounts of Giuffre's fate. Initially, Grok stated that Giuffre had survived a car accident in March 2025 and was alive, even labelling reports of her death as ""misinformation."" However, in a different response, Grok acknowledged her suicide, citing NBC News and her family's statement. A possible explanation for Grok's conflicting replies is a delay in the AI's processing of the news surrounding Giuffre's death.Grok’s first response about the development was:Grok continued denied Giuffre’s death by saying:Later on, the chatbot corrected itself and responded:After her death was announced, a March 2025 Instagram post of Virginia Giuffre reportedly began resurfacing and sparked the Grok mix-up. In that post, she shared a photo from her hospital bed showing facial injuries and warned she had “four more days to live.” The fact that her passing occurred just days after the accident and her dire comment, coupled with the sensitive nature of the situation, may have driven the confusion.","Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, offered contradictory accounts of Virginia Giuffre's death.

PUNE: Asawari Jagdale , 26, performed her father Santosh Jagdale ’s last rites on Thursday, still dressed in the blood-stained clothes she wore when he was shot dead in front of her eyes by terrorists in Pahalgam.“I’ll carry this pain forever. But I’ll also carry my father’s strength,” she told TOI, hours after cremating Santosh Jagdale, 50, who was killed alongside his childhood friend Kaustubh Gunbote in the Tuesday evening attack. Both families had travelled together to Kashmir for a holiday.The two men, residents of Karvenagar in Pune, were among the few tourists targeted by gunmen near the popular Baisaran meadow.“We were clicking pictures when we suddenly heard gunshots. There were screams. We hid behind tents. And then I saw them being shot… right in front of me,” Asawari recalled, calling the assailants “monsters”.Despite the trauma, she remained composed, handling her father's body, consoling her mother, managing formalities, and coordinating with authorities in Pune and Srinagar. “It’s difficult to believe I cremated my own father. I’m only 26, but I had to be strong for my family. I can’t afford to break down,” she said.An interior decorator, an insurance agent, and a farsan shop owner in Shivane, Santosh was known for juggling multiple roles with unshakable dedication. “He never missed a family event. And no matter how busy he was, he made time for everyone,” said Ajay, his elder brother.Santosh, who lived on the ground floor of a three-storey family bungalow, had grown up in Raviwar Peth and learnt the art of farsan-making from his mother, Manikbai. “He would sell the snacks she made when he was a child. That entrepreneurial streak stayed with him all his life,” said Ravindra Patane, a retired insurance manager and close family friend.Gunbote, the other victim, was remembered as Santosh’s shadow — a lifelong friend who had travelled on countless trips with him. Their families often holidayed together. The two were cremated on the same day, a few kilometres apart.Asawari said the past 48 hours had felt like a nightmare, but it was the kindness of strangers — including their driver and an Army officer — that helped them get through. “They didn’t leave our side for a minute. I’ll never forget that.”She has one demand now: justice. “No one deserves to die like this. I saw them fall in front of me. I saw what hate can do. But I’ll live with strength — the kind my father showed every single day.”","Santosh Jagdale, 50, was killed alongside his childhood friend Kaustubh Gunbote in the Tuesday evening attack.

The masked bandit who broke into a DC restaurant and made off with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem 's expensive Gucci purse, filled with thousands of dollars in cash, confidential government documents, and her DHS badge, has been caught, sources said Saturday, reported the New York Post.Noem, 53, was out celebrating Easter family dinner at The Capital Burger, a mile from the White House, when the slick heist took place on April 20. Her designer Gucci shoulder bag, slung carelessly at her feet, was stolen in a matter of seconds by a hooded thief with a surgical mask and a ball cap, a theft right out of a movie script.""It was kind of shocking, actually, because it was sitting right by my feet. I actually felt my purse — he hooked with his foot and drug it a few steps away and dropped a coat over it and took it,"" Noem said afterward in an interview with podcaster Vince Coglianese.At first, Noem said she thought it was just her grandkids kicking her under the table. ""But it was very professionally done,"" she said. ""It tells me that this happens all the time to people, and that they live in communities where this is a danger, and it reaffirms why I’m here.""Within the purloined fashion bag was a haul worthy of a thriller bestseller. $3,000 in cash, her driver's license, passport, DHS badge, and keys to her apartment. Also resting within the bag was a $600 Louis Vuitton Clemence wallet, the police report said, according to the Post.Security camera footage caught the thief in the act. A white male with dark-colored pants and a ""fur-type"" collar, scanning the crowded restaurant with his eyes. He nervously pushed the bag under his coat and rushed out the door, disappearing into the streets of DC before Noem or anyone else even knew what was happening.Sources indicate the suspect, whose name has not been released, is connected to a larger East Coast robbery gang that deals in high-end thefts. Authorities estimate at least two individuals were involved in Noem's robbery, one of whom is said to be a migrant. The second suspect is still at large.The suspect is set to make his initial court appearance early next week.Noem's protection squad, the Secret Service that looks after her under her cabinet rank as she guards Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, as well as the Coast Guard, was involved during the arrest as well as that of the DC Metro Police. Noem's bodyguards were indeed present within the restaurant, even though their proximity to the burglary is in dispute.Investigations remain to be seen whether Noem was targeted due to her authoritative position, or the act was just an opportunistic crime. Noem herself is leaving it to law enforcement to find out.The arrest represents a significant milestone in what authorities believe is part of a larger trend of brazen, organized crimes on the East Coast, with high-profile targets such as Noem now in their sights.As the hunt for the second suspect continues, federal authorities are piecing together how deep the operations of this robbery crew might be.","Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's Gucci purse was stolen from a DC restaurant.

Six of the victims were women, four of them from the same family.Such was the force of the impact that it left most of the victims dismembered, with torn body parts strewn around the area.

They don’t stay jokes. And flirting with authoritarianism doesn’t stay flirting,” Maher warned.The comedian painted a vivid analogy to relationship cheating. “I’m telling you, humans cannot be trusted to just flirt with other attractive humans, and the MAGA crowd cannot be trusted to flirt with dictatorship,” he argued. “Not everyone who flirts cheats. But all cheating starts with flirting.”Maher, who was a vociferous Trump critic during his time in the White House, has been unexpectedly supported by some conservatives and libertarians of late for his public denunciations of ""wokeness."" But on Friday, he made it clear that his dinner meeting with Trump wouldn't silence him from decrying what he perceives as grave dangers.Earlier on Real Time with Bill Maher 's Friday show, the host began by confirming his end-of-March dinner with Trump, brokered after rock star Kid Rock urged the sit-down. Maher reported that the dinner was proof he could be objective, confessing, ""Everything I’ve not liked about him was, I swear to God, absent."" But Maher soon fell back into old habits, cautioning his viewers that Trump's public demeanor is another matter.""I've gotten some s–t from the loony left for just reporting, honestly, how the president responded in private when I was criticizing him to his face,"" Maher said. ""I was truthful about it. And that gives me standing to say to conservatives, 'Now okay, you enjoyed my honesty and balls, now I want to see your balls,'"" he joked. ""What I mean is — it's your turn.""Even after their temporary peace for dinner, Maher indicated there's no cease-fire in sight: he continues to view Trump as perilously close to full-blown authoritarianism, and he's not joking.","Maher was a vociferous Trump critic during his time in the White House.

""This is against the Quran and Sunnah and threatens the religious identity of Muslims,"" said secretary general Ahmad Abdul Quader.Hefazat's warning came during nationwide protests triggered by the Commission's recent report, which Hefazat claims goes against Islamic law . Speaking at a protest site in Narayanganj on Friday, Hefazat joint secretary general Mamunul Haque said, ""We welcomed five of the six reform commissions, but the proposals from the Women's Affairs Reform Commission are shocking. They blame religious and social norms for gender discrimination, which is a clear rejection of Islamic law."" Referring to Yunus, Haque said, ""We have shown him respect, but if he insists on pushing this agenda, we will be compelled to treat him no differently than Sheikh Hasina.""","Radical Islamist group Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh has warned chief adviser Muhammad Yunus.

Steve Bannon says Trump would get a third term easily if he does this,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/steve-bannon-says-trump-would-get-a-third-term-easily-if-he-does-this/articleshow/120652923.cms,"Steve Bannon says Trump has many options to run for president again in 2028.

President Donald Trump's former adviser Steve Bannon said the Constitution that bars one from being the president more than twice can't stop Trump from serving a third term if he starts millionaire tax that would tax the rich but would help him. “This is being fought behind closed doors right now, and I’m telling you, with the massive tax cut, in addition, he’s going to give the working class and the middle class, the math only works out if you actually increase taxes on the wealthy,” the former Trump adviser said on NewsNation suggesting that a system where the rich takes care of the middle class would sustain Trump in power.“The Democrats never raised taxes on oligarchs, never raised taxes on Wall Street, never took away carried interest. The Democratic Party is absolutely beholden to the billionaires, the oligarchs,” Bannon said. “Trump’s the only person ever stood for the working class.”“And this, this massive tax cut, which the Democrats never did, to take the attacks away from a Social Security, take tax away from tips, take tax away from overtime for working class people, is the first time that the working class has got an additional tax cut from everybody else, and Trump’s fighting for that,” he argued.Trump for 2028 sounds like an impossible idea but has been reinforced time and again with a little push from the president himself, as he is not dismissing the talks but providing a little fuel. His organization came up with Trump 2028 hats and T-shirts this week as he asserted he is serious about running for president in 2028 too.""No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once,"" says the 22nd Amendment.But an easy shortcut is to run for the vice president in 2018 with JD Vance running for president. If they win, JD Vance can step down making way for the vice president to become the president.In an interview with TIME magazine published on Friday, Trump said there are ""some loopholes that have been discussed"" to allow him to serve a third term. However, he said he does not ""believe in using loopholes.""On being directly asked whether he would run as a running mate to JD Vance in 2028, he said, ""I don’t know anything about, what, look, all I can say is this, I am being inundated with requests. I'm doing a good job. Great physical exam, and unlike every other president, I took the cognitive test and I aced it 100% and I bet you guys couldn't get 100% on that exam. It's a tough exam. You know, when you get into the mid questions, it gets to be pretty tricky and pretty tough, and the last questions are very tough, and I aced it. And I guarantee, I'd give you, I'd make a big, beautiful bet that you guys couldn't ace it. But anyway. But look, it's good to have you, it’s a very nasty interview. They don’t ask any of the good things.""","Bannon said the Constitution that bars one from being the president more than twice can't stop Trump from serving a third term if he starts millionaire tax that would tax the rich but would help him. “The Democratic Party is absolutely beholden to the billionaires, the oligarchs,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120652924,imgsize-26150,width-400,resizemode-4/Steve-Bannon-says-Trump-has-many-options-to-run-for-president-again-in-2028-.jpg"

And so we chatted about it,"" Singh said adding that he stayed on for Canada's rollout of the new dental care program.Jagmeet Singh said he's sharing this story now because Canadians shared with him their experience with foreign interference -- during the campaign.

Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. He argued that both strategic waterways would ""not exist"" without US involvement and said he had instructed Rubio to ""immediately take care of"" the matter.Trump has repeatedly advocated for greater US control over the Panama Canal in recent months. His latest comments also expanded focus to the Suez Canal, a crucial link between Europe and Asia that previously accounted for about 10 percent of global maritime trade before security threats disrupted operations.Attacks on Red Sea shipping lanes by Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels have forced vessels to divert around Africa’s southern tip, causing major delays and financial losses. The rebels began targeting ships following the outbreak of the Gaza war, claiming to support Palestinians.Egypt reported a 60 percent drop in Suez Canal revenue last year, resulting in a loss of $7 billion. Meanwhile, US military strikes against Huthi positions have intensified under Trump’s leadership, escalating to near-daily assaults over the past month. Trump has pledged that military operations will continue ""until the Huthis are no longer a threat to shipping.""","US President Donald Trump called for American military and commercial vessels to be granted free passage through the Panama and Suez canals.
