Gold stripped from Sabarimala through organised op: SIT,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gold-stripped-from-sabarimala-through-organised-op-sit/articleshow/126296336.cms,"Sabarimala temple

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM/THRISSUR: Gold embedded in sacred structures of Sabarimala temple in central Kerala was allegedly stripped, diverted and converted through a planned operation involving temple officials, intermediaries and private jewellers, a state-appointed SIT told a vigilance court.In a report seeking police custody of key accused, SIT said gold-plated copper sheets forming part of the sanctum sanctorum were removed in 2019 under the pretext of repairs, chemically stripped of gold at a private Chennai workshop and returned with fresh plating to conceal the loss.According to investigators, ornamental panels depicting 10 incarnations of Lord Vishnu, zodiac symbols, the sanctum door lintel and the prabhamandalam (an arch behind the idol) were falsely described as ordinary copper sheets to secure their removal, causing unlawful loss to Travancore Devaswom Board, which manages the temple.SIT alleged criminal breach of trust, saying extracted gold was neither reported to devaswom authorities nor returned to temple treasury but treated as personal property. Arrests have been made and accused remanded in judicial custody, with SIT telling court interrogation in custody was essential to trace remaining gold and establish full chain of responsibility.SIT named former TDB president A Padmakumar, devaswom commissioner N Vasu, Sabarimala executive officer Sudheesh Kumar, administrative officer Murari Babu and others, along with Chennai-based Smart Creations CEO Pankaj Bhandari and Ballari-based jeweller Roddam Pandu Rangaiah Naga Govardhan. Prime accused Unnikrishnan Potti was also produced before court.","Gold embedded in sacred structures of Sabarimala temple in central Kerala was allegedly stripped, diverted and converted.

NEW DELHI: “You are a nominated official, but I am an elected representative … "" The Trinamool Congress ’s offensive against Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar has set the stage for an all-out confrontation over the ongoing Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls ahead of upcoming assembly elections in West Bengal. Mamata Banerjee ’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee , who led a Trinamool delegation to the Election Commission on Wednesday, accused the CEC of “losing temper” and “raising fingers at party members. Abhishek dared the CEC to respond to his allegations.""They think that by raising their voice and speaking aggressively, everyone will be silenced. When we started speaking, he began losing his temper. He tried to stop some of us and pointed fingers at me. I then stated that you are a nominated official, but I am an elected representative. You are answerable to your masters, but I am answerable to the masses who elected me, for whom we have come here to ensure that no legitimate voter is deleted from the list. .. If he has the courage, let him release the footage. I am standing very close to the ECI office,"" Abhishek said standing at the gate of the Election Commission office.""Gyanesh Kumar must be hearing what I am saying to the media right now. If he has the courage, he should come down, face the media, and rebut every point I am making, rather than making selective leaks after 8 pm.What is stopping him? Does he think the people of Bengal are his subservient? Apart from two-three questions, he has failed. Does he think the people of Bengal, and we MPs, ministers, and MLAs elected by the people, are bonded labourers or slaves?"" the Trinamool MP asked, targeting the CEC.Abhishek Banerjee’s dig on selective leaks referred to the party’s last meeting with the poll body on November 28. The Trinamool leader claimed that they had asked the Election Commission five questions in that meeting, but didn't receive a single precise answer to any of them. The Trinamool leader had accused the Election Commission of selectively leaking information to some journalists, claiming that they had answered every question.In return, the Election Commission accused the Trinamool of intimidating its electoral staff in the state.The Election Commission (EC) officials said that the Trinamool Congress (TMC) delegation was told that intimidation of any electoral staff by ground-level political representatives and workers will not be tolerated and that the West Bengal government should immediately release the enhanced honorarium to each BLO.Draft rolls for West Bengal released by the ECI in December show that 58,20,899 names, about 7.59 per cent of the electorate, have been provisionally deleted due to reasons such as death, permanent migration or untraceability. The Trinamool has raised concerns over the scale of deletions, alleging possible disenfranchisement.Also, around 1.36 crore entries have also been flagged for ""logical discrepancies"", while 30 lakh voters were categorised as unmapped – a significant percentage of whom are likely to be called for verification hearings. The timeline for final publication of electoral rolls in the state is February 14, 2026.Abhishek Banerjee questioned the list of ""logical discrepancies"" made by the EC and accused the poll body of weaponsing the voter list to help the BJP. The TMC leader demanded that the list of voters under the ""logical discrepancy"" category be published and the methodology and legal authority used to create this category be disclosed.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has already claimed that the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise was a huge ""scam"" being conducted with the help of artificial intelligence, and has warned that her party will gherao the Election Commission's office in Delhi if the name of even a single legitimate voter is deleted from the electoral rolls.Trinamool Congress has said that it will not accept the final voter list if it has ""discrepancies” and if needed “it would fight it legally."" Clearly SIR, which is already in the centre of a political storm, is set for a rough ride in West Bengal with the Trinamool Congress piling unrelenting pressure on the Election Commission.",Trinamool Congress’s offensive against Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar has set the stage for an all-out confrontation over the ongoing Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls.

Strict action against those who didn’t follow instructions: Mayor

INDORE: Madhya Pradesh's govt late Thursday evening confirmed nine deaths in Bhagirathpura following people falling ill after drinking contaminated water.People from the area had started pouring into hospitals across the city complaining of diarrhoea and vomiting since Monday after the drinking water supply to Bhagirathpura was contaminated with sewage water from a toilet built at the local police check post.Additional chief secretary Sanjay Dubey, in charge of the urban development department, told TOI: ""Nine deaths have been reported in the area. But we can at present attribute only four to the contaminated water based on postmortem examination reports."" Indore district collector Shivam Verma said the initial report of tests on water samples from Bhagirathpura, received late Thursday evening, found the water to be ""contaminated. "" He, however, could not confirm the type of bacteria found.Dubey, meanwhile, met top officials in Indore to chalk out the course of action. “We have worked out guidelines to ensure that funds are allocated and treatment costs of patients are taken care of,” Dubey said. MP CM Mohan Yadav had announced compensation of Rs 2 lakh for each victim’s family. Chief medical and health officer Dr Madhav Prasad Hasani said on Thursday that 1,714 houses were surveyed and 8,571 people were examined.Of these, 338 patients were identified and treated on the spot.Till Thursday, 272 patients had been admitted to hospitals, of which 71 patients have been discharged. There were 201 patients currently in hospitals and 32 in the ICUs.During the meeting, Dubey discussed ways to contain the situation on the ground and ensure safe water supply. “Instructions issued on various works related to water and sewerage were not followed properly and strict action should be taken against those responsible,” Indore mayor Pushyamitra Bhargava said.MP urban development and housing minister Kailash Vijayvargiya, however, said, “Around 60% of old pipelines have been changed. Work on the rest is on.”Earlier in the day, officials visited the site and checked the water supply pipelines. “Water supply was re-started on Thursday. But we did not allow residents to use it. Water samples were taken randomly. They will be tested on alternative days. Only after the samples are cleared will residents be allowed to consume that water,” Dubey said.The tragedy has also prompted authorities to consider taking steps in civic bodies across the state to prevent such incidents. “We will come out with a standard operating procedure to ensure that random water sample collection is carried out in all local bodies to ensure clean water supply,” he said.Vijayvargiya met the affected families and assured them of govt support. “No person and family affected by this outbreak will suffer. A list of those who were admitted to hospitals has been drawn up and treatment costs will be met. Their expenses will be returned to them via cheques,” Vijayvargiya said.MP Congress president Jitu Patwari, meanwhile, criticised BJP-led state govt over the deaths, saying the tragedy was the result of “gross negligence and arrogance of power”. Congress claimed 13 people had died. “This tragedy has occurred due to govt’s negligence and insensitivity. When journalists raise questions, ministers abuse them. This is not democracy but dictatorial thinking,” he said.",People from the area had started pouring into hospitals across the city complaining of diarrhoea and vomiting since Monday.

INDORE: A deathly silence prevails in Bhagirathpura area of Indore. Barring a few people at makeshift medical camps, its lanes are empty. With over 200 people from the area admitted in as many as 27 hospitals across the city after being afflicted with diarrhoea, most residents have been away attending to the ill since Monday night when they began vomiting and developed high fever. Nine persons have died till now.Tragedy struck Bhagirathpura when a pit to clear waste from a toilet built at the local police check post began leaking, leading to the waste water mixing with the main water supply line that ran just beneath it. Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) officials said the contractor had channeled the output from the toilet to a pit above the main water supply line rather than constructing a septic tank and connecting it to the sewage line.On Thursday, even as Madhya Pradesh govt officials scrambled to fix responsibility, spruce up treatment facilities, and clean up the water supply system, Sadhana Sahu, a teacher at a private school, sat on the doorstep of her home in Bhagirathpura and wept uncontrollably. She has lost her six-month-old son. ""Abhyan was born 10 years after we had a daughter. Bas, mera bachcha nahin raha (My child is no more),"" Sadhana said.Abhyan's father, Sunil Sahu, who works from home for an internet firm, said, ""He had diarrhoea and fever. We took him to a doctor on Dec 26. We brought him back home after he was prescribed medicines. He was fine the next two days but suddenly developed high fever, vomited, and died at home on Monday. We couldn't even take him to a hospital.""""The contaminated water caused his death. I had mixed water with his milk and his health deteriorated,"" Sadhana said.Wailing could be heard from some of the homes where death had struck. Almost every household in Bhagirathpura - which has a population of about 15,000, most from economically weak sections living cheek-by-jowl - has one or more people afflicted.""We earn little and barely manage to survive,"" said Alguram Yadav of Borasi ki Gali. His wife Urmila, 65, died on Sunday. His son Sanju, daughter-in-law Roshini and grandson Shivam (11 months) are admitted to hospitals with the same symptoms that took Urmila's life.""Nobody had turned up to help, though some administrative officials came to check.

‘Won’t Serve The 1%’: Zohran Mamdani Promises ‘New Era’ To New Yorkers In First Speech As Mayor

Mamdani's letter to Umar Khalid







NEW DELHI: Student activist Umar Khalid, who has been in jail for nearly five years in connection with the Feb 2020 Delhi riots , has received a show of solidarity from New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani , who wrote to him, saying, ""we are all thinking of you"".The note, undated, was shared on X by Khalid's partner Banojyotsna Lahiri on Thursday, after Mamdani was sworn in as mayor in a midnight ceremony.In the handwritten note, Mamdani said: ""Dear Umar, I think of your words on bitterness often, and the importance of not letting it consume oneself. It was a pleasure to meet your parents. We are all thinking of you."" TOI reached out to Mamdani's office about the note; there was no response at the time of going to press.Khalid, a former JNU student, was arrested in Sept 2020 and charged under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for allegedly conspiring to incite riots in Delhi, charges he has consistently denied. Khalid was granted temporary bail in Dec to attend his sister's wedding.Khalid’s father, Syed Qasim Rasool Ilyas, told TOI that the family met Mamdani early Dec last year during a visit to the United States to meet Khalid’s sister.Ilyas said he had sought time from Mamdani to congratulate him on his appointment and ended up meeting him and his wife for around half an hour. “He gave us time exclusively and we discussed many things, including Umar’s incarceration. We hoped he would fulfil the promises he has made for the people of New York,” he said.“We also spoke about what has been happening to my son and the developments around his case. Mamdani said he follows it and has read Umar’s letters from jail,” he added.“This prolonged incarceration itself is unjust, and that is why it has attracted international attention,” Lahiri said.Ilyas said he also met Democrat Jamie Raskin of the US Congress separately. “He raised concerns over Umar’s arrest and extended support,” he said. “I told him the matter is currently before Supreme Court and the family is positive about a favourable outcome.” Raskin shared a photograph online with Ilyas and his wife.Raskin, along with three other US Congress members, wrote to India’s ambassador to the United States, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, on Dec 30, expressing concern over Khalid’s continued pre-trial detention. The lawmakers said Khalid has been denied bail for five years under UAPA, arguing that the “pre-trial treatment to which he has been subjected is punitive in and of itself”.","Student activist Umar Khalid has been in jail for nearly five years in connection with the Feb 2020 Delhi riots.

In response, civic authorities launched a drive to capture the monkeys. Officials said 58 monkeys were caught over three days.","Incident believed to have taken place in Bahadurgarh, Haryana, on December 26.

What records say about Jovian Markland’s arrest and court case





Yes, online records show that a man named Jovian Markland, also known as Markie Markland, was taken into custody in New York. According to public inmate records from the New York City Department of Correction, a 36-year-old Jamaican national with that name was arrested on Monday, December 29, 2025. The records say he is being held at the Eric M. Taylor Center on remand.This information spread fast on social media. Many Facebook pages shared screenshots of court and jail records. Some posts claimed Markie Markland was stopped while trying to board a flight to Brazil. These details are not confirmed by officials, but the arrest itself appears in official systems. The inmate record lists a code that points to a fugitive or extradition-related matter, not a detailed charge.As of now, Markie Markland has not posted on social media since December 28. His team has also not released any public statement. Because of this silence, rumors have grown online, including claims about fraud. However, no official document lists those claims as charges.Court records from the New York State Unified Court System show that Jovian Markland appeared at Queens Criminal Court on Tuesday, December 30, 2025.The system confirms that a judge ordered him held on remand with bail. The next court date is listed as January 13, 2026.The charge code shown in the jail system is FOA 900.00 ZT. This usually points to a fugitive or extradition warrant. The court website does not list any incident details or specific accusations tied to fraud or real estate. Because of this, claims about real estate fraud remain unverified.During the online discussion, activist Melissa Atwell Holder, known as Melly Mel, shared screenshots of the records and wrote full comments in support of Markland. She wrote, “Free Markie.” She also added, “When the FEDS tek ya off a plane it serious.” Her posts added fuel to the viral spread.Fans also reacted in comments with concern and support. Some asked what happened, while others said they hoped he was safe.

The document claims the situation became serious enough that others had to step in to stop it.This filing was part of OTK’s “motion to compel arbitration and stay litigation,” which explains the organization’s side of events. The statement was written by OTK’s Chief Operating Officer TipsOut, who said the incident played a key role in the group’s decision-making. The case comes after Mizkif moved from Twitch to Kick and later filed a lawsuit against OTK, King Gaming, Mythic Talent, and several streamers. He has denied wrongdoing and says parts of the filing do not reflect what really happened.The legal filing included a section that described an alleged incident during an OTK owners’ meeting on April 17, 2023. The document stated:“On or about April 17, 2023, [Matthew] was in a physical altercation during an owners’ meeting of OTK, which required the intervention by myself and multiple others present to stop [Matthew] from further attacking another owner of OTK.”The filing also mentioned a second incident from September 26, 2023. It claimed Mizkif was involved in another physical situation with a content creator and said the other person suffered injuries.YouTuber Henry Resilient, who often reviews streamer court cases, discussed these claims on his channel and pointed out the details found in the exhibit.Online, speculation grew about who the other person might be. Streamer Felix Lengyel shared his thoughts during a livestream and said:“NMP 100%… I don’t like to speculate about you like that. But since we’re speculating, NMP 100%.”OTK said it later reviewed Mizkif’s behavior and decided to act. The filing stated:“Following completion of its investigation, OTK issued [Matthew] its first Notice of Termination and Repurchase, dated November 6, 2023.”Mizkif addressed the issue on his Kick stream but said he could not share full details because the case is still active. He told viewers:“I really can’t talk about it because it is involved in the lawsuit… but just know that it’s completely misleading… A lot of it is lawyer jargon.”He later added that the incident involved Nick Polom and said:“This was a small thing that happened between me and Nick, three years ago.”Mizkif has continued streaming and has said the legal process will decide the truth.Also Read: Is Clavicular Facing Criminal Charges After Tesla Cybertruck Crash?

Candace Owens’ SHOCKING Declaration After 4.5-Hour Meeting With Charlie Kirk’s Widow Erika | Watch

Candace Owens, Cabot Phillips, and the Charlie Kirk claims explained





Candace Owens and Cabot Phillips became the center of a big online storm after a murder theory started trending on X. The theory tried to link Cabot Phillips to claims about Charlie Kirk . Very quickly, the posts spread, and many people began sharing screenshots, old videos, and timelines.But here is the most important thing first. Charlie Kirk is alive. There has been no murder or assassination. The claims spreading online are theories shared on social media, not facts. This point matters because much of the discussion grew from confusion and viral posts rather than confirmed reporting.Candace Owens used her X account to question timelines and appearances shown on shows linked to The Daily Wire. She also reacted to posts that claimed Cabot Phillips was in certain places before events connected to Turning Point USA. As the topic trended, Phillips publicly denied the claims and shared personal details to explain where he actually was. The back-and-forth kept the topic alive on X and pulled in many well-known conservative media names.Cabot Phillips is a senior editor at The Daily Wire. Before this role, he worked as editor-in-chief at Campus Reform. He is also active on social media, where his videos often get millions of views.Candace Owens claimed online that Phillips was somehow connected to a murder theory involving Charlie Kirk. These claims focused on dates, locations, and media appearances. One post suggested that Phillips had contact with Turning Point USA members before a major event. Owens also questioned clips from Daily Wire shows, pointing to changes in Phillips’ beard to argue that some episodes were pre-recorded.Phillips responded directly on X. He denied being at Fort Huachuca and said he had never been there. He wrote in a full post:“I was not at Ft. Huachuca on 9/8 or 9/9. I’ve never been. I was home in Nashville both days. On the afternoon of the 8th, I attended an ultrasound with my wife and stopped to get balloons for a gender reveal with our son that evening. It’s a boy if anyone was wondering!”Owens later questioned the images and videos Phillips shared and asked him to send them to her directly so she could check the metadata. She also discussed Daily Wire programming and timelines. On December 31, she confirmed that Phillips contacted her and explained that some shows were recorded earlier, which addressed part of her concern.The entire debate played out on X (formerly Twitter), with users taking sides, sharing clips, and pushing the topic into trending lists. As of now, there is no proof backing any murder theory. Charlie Kirk remains alive, and no official source has reported otherwise. Sources for statements in this story include posts from Candace Owens’ X account and Cabot Phillips’ X account.Also Read: “Just Retire”: Candace Owens Fires Back At Alex Jones Over Deep State Claims And Charlie Kirk Killing Debate","Candace Owens and Cabot Phillips became the center of a big online storm after a murder theory started trending on X.

Khaleda Zia’s funeral: EAM Jaishankar Hands Over Modi’s Letter To BNP Chief Tarique Rahman In Dhaka

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to former Bangladesh prime minister Khaleda Zia in a personal letter addressed to her son and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) acting chairman Tarique Rahman, describing her as a leader of “rare resolve and conviction” whose legacy would continue to shape ties between India and Bangladesh.The letter was handed over by external affairs minister S Jaishankar, who represented India at Khaleda Zia’s funeral in Dhaka on Wednesday. Zia, a three-time prime minister and the founding figure of the BNP, died on Tuesday after a prolonged illness, prompting an outpouring of condolences from regional leaders.In his message, PM Modi wrote, “Dear Tarique Rahman Saheb, I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing away of your mother, Her Excellency Begum Khaleda Zia, former Prime Minister of Bangladesh and Chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Please accept my heartfelt condolences on this profound personal loss.” He recalled his meeting with Zia during his visit to Dhaka in June 2015, saying she “made many important contributions to the development of Bangladesh, as well as to the strengthening of India-Bangladesh relations”.PM Modi described Zia as “the first woman Prime Minister of Bangladesh” and said that while her death left “an irreplaceable void”, her “vision and legacy will endure”.Expressing confidence in Tarique Rahman’s political role, he added, “I am confident that her ideals will be carried forward under your able leadership of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and will continue to serve as a guiding light to ensure a new beginning and the enrichment of the deep and historic partnership between India and Bangladesh. ”The prime minister also extended his thoughts to the Bangladeshi people, praising their “shared values, democratic traditions, and a deep sense of national unity”, and wished Rahman strength and fortitude in overcoming the loss.Jaishankar echoed similar sentiments during his interaction with Rahman, later posting on social media that he had conveyed “deepest condolences on behalf of the Government and people of India” and expressed confidence that “Begum Khaleda Zia’s vision and values will guide the development of our partnership”.On the sidelines of the funeral, Jaishankar exchanged greetings with several regional dignitaries, including Pakistan National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Nepal’s foreign minister Balananda Sharma.","PM Modi paid tribute to former Bangladesh prime minister Khaleda Zia in a personal letter addressed to her son and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) acting chairman Tarique Rahman.

They were killed in a road rage, it was no accident' (AI image)







NOIDA: A friend of two youths found dead in front of Army Public School in Noida on Dec 30 told TOI they were chased by an SUV that hurtled into their bike at high speed, sending them flying into roadside railings and killing them on spot.""It was not a hit-and-run accident but a clear case of road rage,"" Pushpendra told TOI on Thursday. The trigger, according to him, was an altercation at an eatery in Sector 30 where his friends Basant Khasu (23) and Rohan Mandal (27) had stopped for parathas on their way back from a party.Pushpendra, who was at the same party, said Basant and Rohan had an argument at the roadside eatery with another customer. Pushpendra subsequently went looking for them. ""I saw the SUV hit their bike. The SUV did not have a number plate. It stopped for a few seconds, then took a U-turn and sped away. I tried to chase, but lost it in dense fog,"" he claimed.Basant and Rohan were flung into the railings next to the school so hard that their bike got entangled in the grille. Their bodies were found next to the bike, indicating they had no opportunity to move and the impact likely immediately killed them.Pushpendra said they had left for Rohan's cousin's birthday party around 10pm on Tuesday from Basant's house at Nithari. Basant was a hotel management student at an institute in Film City.""Around 11.15pm, Basant and Rohan stepped out to drop one of our friends, Roshan. Around 11.40pm, Vikas, who was at the party with us, called Rohan to ask where he was. Rohan told him about the argument. After that, Vikas and I started for the spot on my bike. But we could not find them at the eatery, nor were they answering their phones. I dropped Vikas at the Sector 37 gate, took a U-turn and went towards DPS school. Near Dent Star, I spotted Basant and Rohan driving their bike at high speed and a black SUV right behind them,"" Pushpendra said.He felt the argument at the eatery had blown up into a road rage after Vikas and Rohan's conversation. Puspendra said he followed the car but lost them at the next T-point after they took a right turn towards Army Public School. It was densely foggy that night.""When I was approaching Army Public School, I saw a bike stuck to the grille there. The SUV, probably a Scorpio N, was right there. It reversed and sped off,"" he said. ""When I went closer, I saw Basant and Rohan. They were bleeding.""Basant, a third-year hotel student, lived with his brother Dheeraj and mother Sonam. His father Hari works as a chef in Kenya. Rohan was a contract worker with the fire department. Both lived in Nithari.Pushpendra's account of an argument was corroborated by Sonam, who told TOI on Thursday that Basant had called Dheeraj for help. ""Basant had called me at 11.18pm to say he was on his way home. Everything seemed fine. I did not feel anything was amiss. Around 11.30pm, Basant called Dheeraj and said Rohan had got into a fight with some people and they needed help. Dheeraj thought his brother was joking, so did not take him seriously,"" Sonam said.""They hit both the kids badly. We need justice. My son had so many plans for his life. He was eager to finish his degree and get a job. He also told me about all the places he wanted to visit. All his dreams have gone with him,"" Sonam added. She said police had told them the death was an accident. ""Later, when we challenged that theory, the cops agreed that it did not look like an accident.""Basant's father Hari, who took a flight to Delhi, said, ""He wanted to become a chef and open a hotel. He was a quick learner. We don't know how we will live without him. We live in a high-tech city like Noida, but even after 48 hours, police have not been able to find the culprits. We will keep fighting for my justice for my son,"" he said.Police said they had formed five teams to track down the SUV. ""We are scanning CCTV footage of the area. The issue we are facing is that the SUV did not have a number plate. But our teams are working and we will get a breakthrough,"" a senior officer said. An FIR has been filed under BNS sections for rash driving and causing death due to negligence. Rohan's autopsy indicates ante-mortem head injuries. Basant's family did not agree to an autopsy. ""I believe the men in the SUV were the same people with whom my brother and his friend had an altercation. It's a clear case of murder,"" Dheeraj told TOI.",Two youths were found dead in front of Army Public School in Noida on Dec 30.

According to sources, the woman sustained multiple fractures, including severe injuries to the right side of her face and shoulder. She is not in a condition to speak. Doctors confirmed fractures to her right facial bones, including the zygomatic region, which has also affected the muscles around the eye and cheek.Her elder sister told TOI she was in intense pain when police attempted to record her statement on Thursday. ""She is unable to speak. We are yet to know what exactly happened to her,"" she said.Hospital officials said on Thursday the woman will undergo surgery for her facial and eye injuries.

DEHRADUN: The murder of Anjel Chakma, a 24-year-old MBA student from Tripura, might have fractured a city's sense of safety — but among students from the Northeast living in Dehradun, it has forged something else entirely: resolve.In the three weeks since the Dec 9 incident, when Chakma was allegedly stabbed to death in the city's Selaqui area during a confrontation with a group of local youths, the city's Northeast community has not thinned out. No student from the region has returned home out of fear. Instead, they have chosen to stay — and to protest, publicly and persistently, until justice is served.There are close to 3,000 students from the Northeast enrolled in colleges across Dehradun, many drawn here by the promise of professional courses and relative affordability. The largest groups are from Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland, and around 250 are from Tripura. Chakma, who was studying at a private university, lived among them — just another student in a city that has become an education hub over the past decade, its hostels and PG accommodations filled with young people from India's eastern corners.Since Chakma's death, the protests have grown more organised, with students preparing banners, giving interviews, and demanding institutional accountability — not just arrests, but structural sensitivity.Now, those young people are on the streets, candles in hand, led by Rishikesh Baruah, president of the Northeast Students Association, Dehradun. ""No one left the city after the incident. We decided we won't go home,"" Baruah said in a measured voice, while speaking to TOI late Thursday evening. ""We are more united now. We will stay in Dehradun and demand justice for Anjel."" He added that the community plans to intensify protests until police arrest Yagya Awasthi, the lone accused still absconding.Police have arrested five others including two juveniles in connection with the killing. Awasthi is suspected to be hiding somewhere near the Nepal border. ""Our teams are putting in all-out efforts to track him down. We're treating this case with complete seriousness,"" said inspector Bhaskar Sah, the investigation officer with the special investigation team (SIT) formed to handle the case.Away from the public demonstrations, the emotional aftermath of the killing has taken a quieter shape — in phone calls home, in the hushed recalibration of everyday routines, in informal safety protocols that students have begun to adopt. ""Our families keep calling, worried something might happen again,"" said a 19-year-old student from Nagaland, who requested anonymity. ""We've started being more cautious. We don't step out alone at night. If we are summoned to a police station, someone always comes along.""Students from the Northeast have also begun clustering — living together in the same rooms or apartments where possible, finding comfort in proximity. ""It helps. We're together, we talk, and it's easier to cope with what happened,"" the student said. ""We don't want a repeat of such a tragedy.""","Anjel Chakma, a 24-year-old MBA student from Tripura, was allegedly stabbed to death in the city's Selaqui area.

"UP ex-IAF officer murder: Juvenile killer of 7 and cop join hands; 2 sons gave supari, want share of father’s savings",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/up-ex-iaf-officer-murder-juvenile-killer-of-7-and-cop-join-hands-2-sons-gave-supari-want-share-of-fathers-savings/articleshow/126296463.cms,"





GHAZIABAD: Police have identified one of their own, a constable posted in Kaushambi district, and an old name from juvenile crime registers as killers of a former Indian Air Force officer, who was shot near his house here the day after Christmas.Police said the two are hitmen, who were hired by victim Yogesh Kumar’s sons. A bitter dispute over money and the house had been festering within the family.Naveen Kumar, the constable, and Kumar’s two sons Nitesh and Guddu who gave the ‘supari’ are absconding. His partner in the crime, a 32-year-old man from Bulandshahr, has been arrested, police said on Thursday.The Bulandshahr man was convicted as a juvenile for wiping out his uncle’s family in one of the most shocking crimes to have happened in the state, the 2008 Barari massacre. Among the seven victims were his pregnant aunt and a two-year-old cousin. Just 15 then, he was sent to a correction home. His father, the main accused, was sentenced to death in 2016 by a court.For several years now, he has been living in Ghaziabad. Kumar was his neighbour at Ashok Vihar in Loni. Police said Nitesh and Guddu gave him Rs 5 lakh to kill Kumar. He needed little convincing because he had his own run-ins with Kumar, including over feeding stray dogs in the area, and nursed a grudge.Kumar had retired on July 31 last year as assistant warrant officer from the air force. According to police, the sons wanted a share of his “hefty savings” and were worried he would spend it. The latest flashpoint was Kumar’s decision to sell the house. “Kumar had asked both his sons to vacate the house. As their neighbour, the accused knew this. Kumar’s wife had told him this herself. Besides, Kumar and the accused had a spat over dogs in the locality. Kumar targeted the strays that the accused fed milk and bread to,” Loni ACP Siddharth Gautam said.Police identified the accused through CCTV footage of the Hero Xtreme bike that he and Naveen rode the day of the crime, their faces masked. The bike’s number plate had been removed but police tracked down its owner after questioning people in the vicinity. The owner told police the accused had borrowed his bike “to go shopping”. The accused was arrested from his house. Unlike Nitesh, Guddu and Naveen, he had not escaped to avoid suspicion falling on him. His wife, eight-year-old son and a younger daughter live with him.“Nitesh and Guddu planned the murder with the accused on the terrace of Kumar's house. The accused knew Naveen, who is a constable with UP Police but has been on leave since Aug 2025. On the day of the murder, the accused hit Kumar with an iron rod. When Kumar fell to the ground, Naveen shot him in the head first. The accused fired a second bullet,” the ACP said. Kumar was ambushed by them just 50m from his house. A senior police officer said Naveen had taken a few days’ leave in Aug but never reported back to work.An FIR has been filed at Loni police invoking murder charges and sections of the Arms Act.","Yogesh Kumar, a former Indian Air Force officer, was shot near his house here the day after Christmas.

Can the US revoke citizenship?

The Trump administration was exploring the denaturalisation of Somali-Americans in Minnesota who engaged in fraud, a move that would seek to strip US citizenship from those who illegally obtained tax dollars intended for social services.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt discussed the potential action in a December 31 appearance on Fox News, one day after the US Department of Health and Human Services froze childcare payments to Minnesota following what the agency said was fraud at daycares in the state.""We're also not afraid to use denaturalization,"" Leavitt said. ""That's a tool at the president and the secretary of state's disposal, and it's one this administration has previously used before.""""Absolutely,"" Leavitt said when asked whether Trump wanted Somali-Americans' citizenship revoked if they were convicted of fraud. “It’s something the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State is currently looking at right now.""Federal prosecutors charged 86 individuals with felonies for exploiting federal tax dollars intended to help hungry children during the COVID-19 pandemic for personal gain.More than 60 pleaded guilty or were convicted so far. The case was originally brought by the Biden administration, US Today reported.Of the 86 people charged in a sprawling $250 million case involving Minnesota-administered programmes, 78 were identified as Somali-Americans. Minnesota was home to about 80,000 Somali immigrants, the largest of any state. Most were naturalised citizens, foreign-born individuals who went through a legal process to gain their citizenship.Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in a December 30 appearance on The Charlie Kirk Show podcast, said DHS investigators were currently going ""door to door"" to suspected fraud sites in Minnesota ""to make sure we follow the money here and we bring arrests, prosecutions and ultimately removals.""The White House also seized on a recent viral video from conservative influencer Nick Shirley that claimed abandoned daycare centres were receiving millions in state taxpayer dollars. FBI Director Kash Patel on Dec. 28 said his agency had ""surged personnel and investigative resources to Minnesota to dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs.""Stripping citizenship from naturalised US citizens was rare and had a high bar. Federal courts, not the administration, made the final decisions. Denaturalisation could be pursued through either civil proceedings or a criminal conviction.During President Donald Trump's first term in office, the Justice Department filed 168 denaturalisation cases in federal court, while the Biden administration filed 64 such cases, a database created by Irina Mantra, a Hofstra University law professor, found. An average of 11 denaturalisation cases per year were filed between 1990 and 2007.The general grounds for denaturalisation involved the ""illegal procurement of naturalization"" or the ""concealment of a material fact or willful misrepresentation,"" according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, a federal agency. In addition, the federal govt could cite an individual's current or past affiliation with a totalitarian political party or terrorist organisation.Demonstrators rallied in protest against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), amid a reported federal immigration operation targeting the Somali community, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, US, December 8, 2025.Trump called Somali immigrants in Minnesota ""garbage,"" igniting pushback from immigrant rights advocates who argued the White House's focus on the Minnesota fraud case was an excuse to target the immigrant population. Trump and Republicans blamed Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee, for allowing the fraud to unfold.Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minnesota, a close ally of Trump, called for the denaturalisation of Somali-Americans convicted of fraud in a Dec. 30 post on Facebook.“I have three words regarding Somalis who have committed fraud against American taxpayers: Send them home. If they’re here illegally, deport them immediately; if they’re naturalized citizens, revoke their citizenship and deport them quickly thereafter,"" Emmer said.","White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt discussed the potential action in a December 31 appearance on Fox News. The move would seek to strip US citizenship from those who illegally obtained tax dollars intended for social services.

‘Asked sons to vacate house sparked bloodshed’: They hired hitmen to kill UP ex-IAF officer; chilling details emerge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ghaziabad/asked-to-vacate-house-sparked-bloodshed-sons-hire-hitmen-to-kill-up-ex-iaf-shot-him-in-head-chilling-details-emerge/articleshow/126297947.cms,"





GHAZIABAD: The latest flashpoint in a bitter family feud was the decision of former Indian Air Force officer Yogesh Kumar to sell his house. “Kumar had asked both his sons to vacate the house,” said Loni ACP Siddharth Gautam, setting off a chain of events that ended in his murder the day after Christmas.Police have identified the killers as a Kaushambi-based constable, Naveen Kumar, and a 32-year-old man from Bulandshahr, both hired by Kumar’s sons, Nitesh and Guddu.The two sons allegedly provided the hitmen with Rs 5 lakh to carry out the attack. Naveen Kumar and the sons are currently absconding. The Bulandshahr man, who had a criminal past as a juvenile, has been arrested.The arrested man had been convicted in the infamous 2008 Barari massacre, in which he killed seven members of his uncle’s family, including a pregnant aunt and a two-year-old cousin. At the time, he was just 15 and sent to a correction home, while his father, the main accused, was sentenced to death in 2016. He has been living in Ghaziabad for several years and was a neighbour of Kumar in Ashok Vihar, Loni.Police said the accused had a personal grudge against Kumar, including disputes over feeding stray dogs in the locality, which made him an easy target for Nitesh and Guddu’s plan.Kumar had retired as an assistant warrant officer on July 31 last year.Police said the sons were motivated by a desire to access their father’s “hefty savings” and feared losing control over the property.According to police, the murder was meticulously planned. CCTV footage showed the accused and Naveen riding a Hero Xtreme bike on the day of the crime, their faces masked. Although the bike’s number plate had been removed, police traced its owner, who revealed it had been borrowed “to go shopping.” The accused was arrested from his residence, where he lives with his wife and two children. Naveen and the sons remain at large.ACP Gautam detailed the attack: “Nitesh and Guddu planned the murder with the accused on the terrace of Kumar’s house. The accused knew Naveen, who is a UP Police constable but had been on leave since August 2025. On the day of the murder, the accused hit Kumar with an iron rod. When Kumar fell to the ground, Naveen shot him in the head first. The accused fired a second bullet.” The attack occurred just 50 meters from Kumar’s house.An FIR has been registered at Loni police station, invoking murder charges along with sections of the Arms Act. Police are continuing the investigation to apprehend the remaining accused and probe whether the attack was premeditated or influenced by other disputes.","Yogesh Kumar, a former Indian Air Force officer, was shot dead in Ghaziabad.

INDORE: Bhagirathpura in Indore has fallen eerily quiet. Streets that are usually crowded remain largely deserted, save for a handful of residents at temporary medical camps set up in the locality. With more than 200 people from the neighbourhood hospitalised across 27 medical facilities in the city, most families have been away since Monday night, tending to relatives struck by diarrhoea, vomiting and high fever. Nine residents have died so far.For Sadhana Sahu, a private school teacher, the silence is permanent. Sitting outside her home on Thursday, she struggled to speak through tears as she recalled losing her five-month-old son, Abhyan. “The water was contaminated. I mixed it with his milk and his condition worsened,” she said.The crisis in Bhagirathpura began when waste water from a toilet constructed at a police check post seeped into the main drinking water pipeline below it. Officials of the Indore Municipal Corporation said the contractor had diverted the toilet’s discharge into a pit located directly above the water line instead of building a septic tank connected to the sewer system, leading to large-scale contamination.As state officials rushed on Thursday to identify lapses, improve treatment facilities and flush the water supply network, Sadhana remained inconsolable. Abhyan, she said, was born a decade after the couple’s first child. “We waited 10 years for him. Now he is gone,” she said.Her husband, Sunil Sahu, who works remotely for an internet services firm, said their son first showed symptoms of diarrhoea and fever on December 26. “We took him to a doctor and brought him home with medicines. For two days, he seemed better. Then suddenly on Monday, his fever spiked, he vomited and collapsed. He died at home. We didn’t even get the chance to reach a hospital,” he said.Grief hangs heavy across Bhagirathpura, a densely populated area of nearly 15,000 people, most of whom belong to economically weaker sections. Almost every household has one or more members suffering from similar symptoms.From Borasi ki Gali, Alguram Yadav said his 65-year-old wife, Urmila, died on Sunday. His son, daughter-in-law and 11-month-old grandson are currently undergoing treatment in hospital. “We barely get by. When illness strikes, everything collapses,” he said.Yadav said apart from visits by officials to take stock of the situation, little help reached families initially. “The minister came and handed over the Rs 2 lakh compensation cheque announced by the chief minister,” he said, adding that many families were still struggling to cope with medical costs and loss.",Waste water from a toilet constructed at a police check post seeped into the main drinking water pipeline below it.

‘Kyiv Forced Injured To…’: Russia Levels Shocking Charge After Deadly Kherson Attack

How the events unfolded





Days after Russia claimed that Ukraine tried to target President Vladimir Putin’s official residence in a drone attack, Russian authorities on Thursday said they had shared what they described as evidence linked to the incident with the United States.The Russian defence ministry released a video on Telegram showing a meeting between Igor Kostyukov, chief of Russia’s main intelligence directorate, and a representative from the US military attache’s office in Moscow. Russian officials said the meeting was held to present materials connected to the alleged drone strike.“I am Igor Kostyukov, chief of the main intelligence directorate of the general staff of the armed forces of Russia. I have invited you for an important matter. I would like to inform you that we have found the debris of unmanned aerial vehicles involved in this attack,” Kostyukov said at the start of the meeting, as seen in the video.During the meeting, Kostyukov showed a device that he said was recovered from one of the drones. He claimed that several drones shot down during the incident had navigation systems that were still intact.“In several of these drones, the navigation systems are well-preserved and technically functional. The decoding of the content of the memory of the navigation controllers of these drones, carried out by specialists of the Russian special services, unequivocally and accurately confirmed that the target of the attack was the complex of buildings of the residence of the President of the Russian Federation in the Novgorod region,” he said, as quoted by Anadolu Agency.Kostyukov then handed the device to the US military representative. “We want to hand over this controller and the description of this controller made by our specialists to you. We believe that this step will help to remove all questions and contribute to the establishment of the truth,” he said.A drone strike in Russia’s Novgorod region earlier this week was allegedly aimed at the presidential residence. Moscow blamed Ukraine for the attack, an allegation Kyiv denied.Ukraine said Russia had provided no evidence to support its allegation, following which Russia released a video showing a damaged unmanned aerial vehicle lying in snow in a wooded area.US President Donald Trump said he was angry after learning about the reported incident. Speaking to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago club, Trump said, “I don’t like it. It’s not good. I learned about it from President Putin today. I was very angry about it.”By Wednesday, however, Trump appeared more sceptical, sharing on social media a New York Post editorial accusing Russia of obstructing peace efforts in Ukraine.Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has warned that Russia would respond to the attack and said the timing and targets of Moscow’s response had already been decided.","Russia claims Ukraine tried to target President Putin's official residence in a drone attack.

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: A government-constituted magisterial inquiry has found that the Goa nightclub where a devastating fire killed 25 people in early December was built illegally on a salt pan and operated for months without valid permissions, pointing to systemic failures and alleged collusion by local authorities, as reported by news agency PTI.The fire broke out late on December 6 during a crowded event after fireworks were set off without adequate safety measures or equipment. The club lacked emergency exits on both floors and was operating without valid permissions. The blaze killed 25 people, including tourists and staff.The report, made public on Wednesday, said the structure of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, North Goa, stood in the middle of a salt pan or water body and was “not permissible under any law”, either current or past, violating the Goa Land Revenue Code and Coastal Zone Regulations.The inquiry revealed that the village panchayat issued an establishment licence to the operator in December 2023, valid only until March 31, 2024. Despite the licence not being renewed, the premises continued to function as a bar and nightclub, with no steps taken by the panchayat to seal it, even though the Goa Panchayat Raj Act empowers such action.Also read: Birch staff tried to douse fire with a glass and water bottle: Survivor Statements recorded during the probe showed that senior panchayat officials were aware of the lapse but failed to inform other departments, which continued granting permissions based on the expired trade licence.The report concluded that this amounted to collusion with the owners and a violation of conduct rules, PTI reported.Serious irregularities were also flagged in the original licensing process. The inquiry noted alleged forgery in the application, including entries added later in different ink, missing mandatory documents such as approved plans and land records, and a hurried approval process completed within days. Officials admitted they had not verified the house number or legality of the structure before issuing the licence.Despite multiple complaints over noise pollution and parking between January 2024 and December 2025, inspections repeatedly recorded “nothing found on the spot”, and directions of the Bombay High Court regarding night patrolling were not followed.Police have registered the case under several Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita sections, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder, negligence, forgery and criminal conspiracy.Eight people have been arrested so far, including co-owners Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra.",A government-constituted magisterial inquiry has found that the Goa nightclub where a devastating fire killed 25 people in early December was built illegally on a salt pan.

Who are the victims?





At least 40 people were charred to death and over 100 others were injured after a deadly fire ripped a crowded bar in the ski resort town of Crans-Montana in Switzerland during a New Year's party.According to the Swiss police, the blaze broke out in the early morning hours at Le Constellation where young partygoers who gathered at the bar to celebrate the new year.Officials added that they are still investigating the cause of the fire and the explosion that followed. However, they ruled out the possibility of the terrorist attack.Emergency services sent 10 helicopters and 40 ambulances to transport the injured to hospitals, officials said at a news briefing Thursday morning. The emergency ward and operating rooms at the nearest major medical center ran out of space to treat the victims.Three specialized jets took burn victims to Zurich, the country's largest city, about 90 miles away. In an interview with the Swiss news site 24 heures, Claire Charmet, the head of a hospital in Lausanne, where 22 severely burned patients were taken, said most of the survivors were between 16 and 26.According to police commander Frederic Gisler, the smoke was spotted around 1.30am.Few seconds later a witness contacted the police.""Immediately, the red alarm, which mobilises the fire department, was triggered,"" Gisler said, adding that firefighters ""quickly contained the blaze"" while the injured were being treated.Authorities, however, declined to speculate on what caused the tragedy.Meanwhile, several news channels seemed to point to sparklers that were apparently mounted on top of champagne bottles and held aloft by restaurant staff as part of a regular ""show"" put on for patrons who made special orders to their tables.""I think there were some ladies, waitresses, with champagne bottles and little sparklers. They got too close to the ceiling, and suddenly it all caught fire,"" Axel, who was present at the time of the incident, told the Italian media outlet Local Team.A tourist from New York, who filmed bright orange flames pouring from the bar, told AFP he saw people running and screaming.Alexis Lagger, an 18-year-old, had been walking with a group of friends past Le Constellation bar, a spot popular with young people and tourists, when they noticed smoke and flames emerging from the venue and called the police.""People were running through the flames. People were using chairs to try to break the windows,"" he told Swiss public broadcaster RTS.According to Crans-Montana website, Le Constellation has a capacity of 300 people, plus another 40 people on its terrace.However, several witnesses said that the event space in the basement of the establishment, where the fire began, was connected with the ground floor by only a staircase, which some described as ""narrow"".Meanwhile, Wallis's chief prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud contested the allegations and stressed that the cause of the tragedy was still being investigated.Responding to questions from reporters, she said she had seen the site herself.""What exactly constitutes a narrow staircase?"" she asked, stressing that the probe would ""determine whether all safety standards were met"".Pilloud also said it was ""too early"" to comment on whether emergency exits met the required standards, or whether the necessary procedures had been followed before organising the New Year's event.Multiple sources told news agency AFP that the bar owners are French nationals: a couple originally from Corsica who, according to a relative, are safe and sound, but who have been unreachable since the tragedy.Given the bar's usually youthful clientele, questions were also being raised about the possible presence of minors at the time of the tragedy.The bar was a popular spot among the tourists and drew a young crowd. Authorities are yet to release any information on the victims, but said that foreign nationals are also expected among the victims.""Given the international nature of the Crans resort, we can expect foreign nationals to be among the victims,"" Gisler said.He said Swiss authorities were ""in close contact with the victims' families, whom we are informing in real time, as well as with the various embassies involved"".Stephane Ganzer, head of Wallis's security department, did not confirm that.But, he told reporters, ""you can imagine that on New Year's Eve, in a ski resort, the population is undoubtedly quite young"".We have someone close to us who is still missingMeanwhile, hundreds gathered in silence in the freezing night, laying flowers and lighting candles to remember the victims.""There are dead and injured, and we have someone close to us who is still missing.

INDORE: Laboratory tests have confirmed that the diarrhoea outbreak in Indore, which has so far claimed at least four lives and sickened more than 1,400 people, was caused by contaminated drinking water, officials said.Indore’s Chief Medical and Health Officer (CMHO) Dr Madhav Prasad Hasani said a report prepared by a city-based medical college found that water samples collected from Bhagirathpura were contaminated due to a leak in a main supply pipeline. The area has emerged as the epicentre of the outbreak.District collector Shivam Verma said the initial laboratory report confirmed contamination in the water samples, though officials were yet to identify the specific bacteria responsible.State minister Kailash Vijayvargiya said preliminary indications suggested that sewage water had mixed with the drinking water supply near a police check post. “We are already treating the water. A detailed microbiological examination will take eight to ten days,” he said.Residents of Bhagirathpura began reporting to hospitals across the city from Monday onwards, complaining of vomiting, diarrhoea and high fever.Officials said the contamination occurred after sewage water from a toilet constructed at a local police check post seeped into the drinking water line.Additional chief secretary Sanjay Dubey, who oversees the urban development department, said nine deaths had been reported from the area so far. “Based on post-mortem findings, only four deaths can currently be linked directly to contaminated water,” he said.Dubey held meetings with senior officials in Indore to review the situation and finalise relief measures. “Guidelines have been worked out to ensure funds are made available and treatment costs for patients are covered,” he said. Chief Minister Mohan Yadav has announced compensation of Rs 2 lakh each for the families of those who died.Health department officials said door-to-door surveys were conducted in 1,714 households on Thursday, during which 8,571 people were examined. Of these, 338 individuals with mild symptoms were provided treatment at their homes.Bhagirathpura, meanwhile, remains largely deserted. With more than 200 residents admitted to 27 hospitals across Indore, most families have been away attending to sick relatives. Since the outbreak began earlier this week, nine people have died.Municipal officials said the crisis was triggered when waste water from a pit connected to a toilet at the police outpost leaked into the main water pipeline running beneath it. The contractor allegedly routed the toilet’s waste into a pit instead of constructing a septic tank and linking it to the sewage network.Officials said a leak was detected in the main water pipeline near the police outpost, leading to contamination of the supply in surrounding areas. “We are examining the entire pipeline to check for additional leaks,” Dubey said.After repairs and inspection, clean water was restored through the pipeline on Thursday. However, residents have been advised to boil water before consumption as a precaution. Fresh samples have also been sent for testing.The state government is now planning to issue a standard operating procedure for drinking water infrastructure across Madhya Pradesh to prevent similar incidents in the future.According to officials, 272 patients have been admitted to hospitals since the outbreak began eight days ago. Of them, 71 have been discharged. At present, 201 patients remain hospitalised, including 32 in intensive care units.",Officials said the contamination occurred after sewage water from a toilet constructed at a local police check post seeped into the drinking water line.

‘We’re Unstoppable’: Maduro’s New Year Message To Trump After Venezuela Shoots Down 9 Aircraft





Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro on Thursday said he was open to working with Washington, weeks after the United States threatened action and carried out strikes on alleged drug boats off the Venezuelan coast.Speaking on state television, Maduro said Venezuela was willing to talk to the United States on issues such as drug trafficking, oil and migration. “Wherever they want and whenever they want,” he said, when asked about dialogue with Washington.At the same time, Maduro avoided giving a clear answer on claims made by US president Donald Trump that American forces had attacked a dock in Venezuela used by alleged drug boats. Asked directly whether the attack had taken place, Maduro said it was “something we could talk about in a few days.”Earlier this week, Trump said the United States had struck and destroyed a docking area used by Venezuelan drug boats.“There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs,” Trump told reporters.If confirmed, the strike would be the first known land attack linked to the US campaign against drug trafficking from Latin America. For weeks, Trump has warned that ground strikes against drug cartels in the region could begin soon.Since September, US forces have also carried out several strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean.","Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro says he is open to working with Washington.

Russia Says Ukraine Launched Drones At Moscow On New Year Eve As Putin Addressed Nation





The CIA has determined that Ukraine did not target President Putin of Russia or one of his residences in an attack this week, according to US officials, rebutting an assertion Putin made in a phone call to President Trump on Monday. CIA director John Ratcliffe briefed Trump on the finding, a person familiar with the matter said.Trump has not directly acknowledged the intelligence, but on Wednesday, he posted on social media a link to a New York Post editorial that blamed Putin for standing in the way of a peace deal with Ukraine and cast doubt on the veracity of his claim that he was the target of an attack. On Monday, Trump had said he was ""very angry"" about the purported attack when Putin told him about it. The CIA declined to comment, and the White House referred questions to Trump's social media post.Russia had used the claim to threaten to harden its stance in negotiations as thorny issues already appear to be hampering talks to end the war. But it has not presented any clear-cut evidence of the purported drone attack, which it said was aimed at Putin's residence in the Novgorod region.Instead, the finding by US intelligence officials, which was reported earlier by WSJ, aligns with Ukrainians, who denied the Russians' allegations.In a post on social media, President Zelensky called the claim ""a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine...""On Monday, even as Trump said he was angry about the purported attack, he conceded he had no independent confirmation and that it was ""possible"" it had not happened. ""It's a delicate period of time. This is not the right time. It's one thing to be offensive because they're offensive. It's another thing to attack his house,"" he said.","CIA director briefed Trump on finding, a person familiar with the matter said.

Indian-origin Zohran Mamdani early Thursday was sworn in as New York City's mayor, beginning a four-year term. The 34-year-old Democrat, known for his left-leaning views and criticism of US President Donald Trump, took the oath of office just after midnight at the long-abandoned City Hall subway station beneath Manhattan’s City Hall.Mamdani made history as New York's first Muslim mayor, placing his hand on the Quran during the ceremony. ""This is truly the honour and the privilege of a lifetime,"" he said after being sworn in.The oath was administered by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a close political ally at the historic City Hall station one of the city's original subway stops, famed for its elegant arched ceilings.Mamdani will be sworn in again later on Thursday in a larger public ceremony at City Hall, where US Senator Bernie Sanders, one of his political inspirations, will administer the oath.The event will be followed by a public block party along Broadway’s ""Canyon of Heroes,"" traditionally known for ticker-tape parades.During the mayoral campaign, Trump had threatened to withhold federal funding from New York City if Mamdani won and even floated the idea of deploying National Guard troops.However, the president later surprised both supporters and critics by inviting Mamdani to the White House for what was described as a cordial meeting in November.""I want him to do a great job and will help him do a great job,"" Trump said.Despite this, tensions are expected to resurface given their sharp policy differences, particularly on immigration.Born on October 18, 1991, in Kampala, Uganda, Mamdani is the son of Indian-origin parents and acclaimed filmmaker Mira Nair, known for films such as Salaam Bombay! and Monsoon Wedding, and Mahmood Mamdani, an Indian-born Ugandan academic.He spent part of his early childhood in Cape Town before moving to New York at the age of seven.Mamdani was educated at St George’s Grammar School in Cape Town, Bank Street School for Children, and the Bronx High School of Science. He went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in Africana Studies from Bowdoin College in 2014. While in college, he co-founded Students for Justice in Palestine and later worked on several progressive political campaigns in New York.In 2019, Mamdani won a seat in the New York State Assembly from the 36th District, representing Astoria and Long Island City, where he focused on issues such as housing, transit affordability and immigrant rights, priorities that shaped his mayoral bid.A practising Shia Muslim, Mamdani married Syrian artist Rama Duwaji earlier this year. Her illustrations have appeared in The New Yorker and The Washington Post.The couple will move from their one-bedroom, rent-stabilised apartment in an outer borough to the official mayoral residence in Manhattan.","Indian-origin Zohran Mamdani sworn in as New York City's mayor.

A ‘red line’ between Saudi and UAE

Yemen’s leadership steps in

Why this matters for Yemen

(With inputs from agencies)





Saudi Arabia’s airstrikes on Yemen’s southern port city of Mukalla this week have exposed a sharp and public rupture inside what was once a unified Gulf-backed coalition.What began as a complex war against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement has now evolved into an open confrontation between partners who once fought on the same side.The strikes followed the arrival of two vessels from the UAE port of Fujairah, which Saudi Arabia says unloaded weapons and armoured vehicles destined for the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC), a separatist force seeking self-rule in southern Yemen. Riyadh described the shipments as an “imminent threat” to its national security and warned that Emirati actions were “extremely dangerous”, language that underscored the seriousness of the fallout.At the heart of the dispute lies Saudi Arabia’s fear that instability in Yemen’s eastern provinces, particularly Hadramout and al-Mahra, could spill directly onto its borders.Saudi warplanes struck targets in Mukalla after the Saudi-led coalition accused two ships of arriving without authorisation, disabling their tracking systems and unloading “a large amount of weapons and combat vehicles” to support the STC.Riyadh said the operation was limited, conducted overnight, and aimed at preventing collateral damage.“The crews had the disabled tracking devices aboard the vessels and unloaded a large amount of weapons and combat vehicles in support of Southern Transitional Council’s forces,” the coalition said. “Considering that the aforementioned weapons constitute an imminent threat, and an escalation that threatens peace and stability, the Coalition Air Force has conducted this morning a limited airstrike.”Footage aired by Yemeni state media showed black smoke rising from the port and burned vehicles near the docks. Saudi state media said there were no casualties, though local residents reported damage to nearby homes.The Southern Transitional Council (STC) is a separatist movement in southern Yemen that seeks autonomy or independence for the region. It was formed in May 2017 following mass protests in the southern port city of Aden over the dismissal of its leader, Aidarus al-Zoubaidi, who now heads the council.The STC’s stated goal is to “reinstate the Southern State”, referring to the independent country that existed in South Yemen between 1967 and unification with the north in 1990. Support for southern secession has long existed, but gained momentum after Yemen’s civil war erupted in 2014.Backed by the United Arab Emirates, the STC controls key territory in the south, including Aden, and commands armed forces known as the Southern Armed Forces. While it has at times shared power with Yemen’s internationally recognised government, its core demand for southern self-rule remains unchanged.The STC now faces a critical test. It is part of the Presidential Leadership Council, yet its forces have seized swathes of territory from Saudi-backed units. Its leadership insists the UAE remains a “main partner” in the fight against the Houthis and has rejected Al-Alimi’s orders, saying they lack consensus.While the STC has framed its advance as consolidating southern control, defying Riyadh carries risks. Saudi Arabia controls Yemen’s airspace and has made clear it will act to prevent any shift that threatens its security interests.Saudi Arabia and the UAE were once the twin pillars of the coalition formed in 2015 to restore Yemen’s internationally recognised government after the Houthis seized the capital, Sanaa. While both opposed the Houthis, their long-term goals increasingly diverged.Riyadh has remained committed to a unified Yemen under the internationally recognised government. Abu Dhabi, by contrast, has backed the STC, which seeks to revive the formerly independent state of South Yemen. That divergence has now erupted into open confrontation.Saudi Arabia accused the UAE of pressuring the STC to carry out military operations near its borders, calling such actions a “threat to the kingdom’s national security”. “The Kingdom stresses that any threat to its national security is a red line,” the Saudi foreign ministry said, adding that it would not hesitate to act.The UAE rejected the accusations, saying the shipment “did not contain any weapons” and that the vehicles were intended for Emirati forces operating in Yemen. It condemned any attempt to implicate it in operations threatening Saudi security and called for restraint and coordination.The UAE said it was surprised by the Saudi airstrike and rejected allegations that it directed STC military operations.“The UAE categorically rejects any attempt to implicate it in the tensions between Yemeni parties,” its foreign ministry said, calling for restraint and coordination.Abu Dhabi said its presence in Yemen was at the invitation of the internationally recognised government and within the Saudi-led coalition framework. It urged that recent developments be handled “responsibly and in a way that prevents escalation”.Later in the day, the UAE announced that it would withdraw its remaining forces from Yemen.""The Ministry of Defence announces the termination of the remaining counterterrorism teams in Yemen,"" a statement from the ministry said, as cited by news agency AFP.The focus on Hadramout and al-Mahra is no coincidence. Hadramout borders Saudi Arabia and has deep economic and historical ties with the kingdom. Al-Mahra sits astride key land routes linking Yemen to Oman and Saudi Arabia and controls vital ports and crossings.For Riyadh, large-scale instability in the east is not a distant Yemeni problem but a direct border security issue. Saudi officials fear that unchecked STC expansion could redraw control over resource-rich areas and trade routes, creating long-term insecurity along the kingdom’s southern frontier.This explains why Saudi Arabia warned the STC against advancing into Hadramout and demanded a withdrawal, a call the separatists dismissed.The escalation was framed politically through Yemen’s internationally recognised leadership. Rashad al-Alimi, head of the Presidential Leadership Council, cancelled a defence pact with the UAE and ordered Emirati forces to leave Yemen within 24 hours. In a televised speech, he accused Abu Dhabi of fuelling strife by backing the STC.“Unfortunately, it has been definitively confirmed that the United Arab Emirates pressured and directed the STC to undermine and rebel against the authority of the state through military escalation,” he said.Al-Alimi also imposed a temporary no-fly zone and a sea and ground blockade on ports and crossings, except for coalition-approved exemptions, signalling the seriousness of the moment.The escalation risks opening a new front in Yemen’s decade-long war, with anti-Houthi forces turning on each other while the Houthis remain entrenched in the north, including in Sanaa.More than ten years of conflict have already killed over 150,000 people and created one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. Strategic southern regions now at the centre of the dispute hold key ports and most of Yemen’s oil reserves.","Saudi Arabia and the UAE were once the twin pillars of the coalition formed in 2015 to restore Yemen’s internationally recognised government.

Are Sikh drivers being targeted?





California will delay the cancellation of around 17,000 commercial driver’s licences until March to allow more time for truckers and bus drivers who legally qualify to keep them, the Blue state announced on Tuesday.The move comes a week after immigrant advocacy groups filed a lawsuit challenging the revocations.The US department of transportation warned California that failing to meet a January 5 deadline could cost the state $160 million in federal funds. Secretary Sean Duffy has already held back $40 million because he claims the state is not making sure commercial drivers meet English language requirements.California only began sending notices to revoke the licences after Duffy pressured the state to ensure that immigrants who are in the country illegally are not granted commercial driving privileges. An audit found licences that remained valid long after an immigrant’s legal authorisation expired and also cases where the state could not confirm it had checked a driver’s immigration status properly.“California does NOT have an ‘extension’ to keep breaking the law and putting Americans at risk on the roads,” Duffy said in a post on X.In August, a truck driver who was not authorised to be in the US made an illegal U-turn in Florida, causing a crash that killed three people.In October, a similar incident in California involved an unauthorised driver in a crash that also resulted in fatalities.The Sikh Coalition and the Asian Law Caucus filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the affected drivers, saying that immigrant truckers were being unfairly targeted. Mumeeth Kaur, legal director of the Sikh Coalition, said the delay “is an important step towards alleviating the immediate threat that these drivers are facing to their lives and livelihoods.”Immigrants are around 20 per cent of all truck drivers, but the special non-domiciled licences they can get make up only 5 per cent of California’s commercial licences. A court has paused federal efforts to make stricter rules on who among noncitizens can qualify.California officials said they are working to ensure the federal Transportation Department is satisfied with the reforms implemented.Department of Motor Vehicles (DMC) director Steve Gordon said, “Commercial drivers are an important part of our economy — our supply chains don’t move, and our communities don’t stay connected without them.”","California will delay the cancellation of around 17,000 commercial driver’s licences until March.

Former US ambassador and Indian-origin Nikki Haley took a swipe at New York City’s new mayor Zohran Mamdani on the day of his swearing-in, mocking his inaugural speech as sounding more like Chinese Communist Party rhetoric than American politics.Reacting to the speech on X, Haley wrote, “Xi Jinping wants his speech back,” a comment that went among conservative users and added fuel to an already heated debate over Mamdani’s socialist views.Zohran Mamdani was sworn in on January 1, 2026, becoming New York City’s 112th mayor and its first Muslim mayor. The 34-year-old is a democratic socialist and won the 2025 mayoral election held in November. He built his campaign around affordable housing, higher taxes on the wealthy, expanded public services, defunding police, and a stronger role for government in daily life.In his inaugural address outside City Hall, Mamdani doubled down on his Left ideological stance. “I was elected as a democratic socialist and I will govern as a democratic socialist,” he told the Blue crowd.Although one line from the speech was criticised by the right: “We will replace the frigidity of rugged individualism with the warmth of collectivism.”Haley’s comment appeared to be aimed directly at that line.Social media users said the comment is similar to that of Communist leaders like Joseph Stalin or Mao Zedong.The ceremony was attended by huge progressive figures, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders, who similarly aligned with Mamdani’s position among the left wing of the Democratic Party.“If you are a New Yorker, I am your mayor,” Mamdani said.Zohran Mamdani won the NYC elections in November last year against independent candidate Andrew Cuomo. The odds were against the socialist leader as he was a newbie in America's wealthiest city and was facing veterans endorsed by MAGA chief Trump himself.

Donald Trump says exercising is 'boring' as his physician confirms he takes 325 milligrams of aspirin 'daily',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-says-exercising-is-boring-as-his-physician-confirms-he-takes-325-milligrams-of-aspirin-daily/articleshow/126296233.cms,"On Cam: Trump INJURED, Mystery Bruise 'Spreads' As Health Panic Rocks America | 'HOLE IN HAND...'





US President Donald Trump has admitted he finds exercise boring, even as doctors recommend steps to protect his health.In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, the MAGA chief said, “I just don’t like it. It’s boring. To walk on a treadmill or run on a treadmill for hours and hours like some people do, that’s not for me. ”The soon-to-be 80-year-old GOP leader is an avid golfer and considers playing golf his form of exercise. “My ‘exercise’ is playing, almost never during the week, a quick round of golf,” he told reporters in 2020.Trump also discussed his medical choices, revealing that he takes a daily 325-milligram aspirin dose to thin his blood, higher than the 81 milligrams recommended by doctors, according to CNN. “They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart. I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart. Does that make sense?” he said.Doctors have expressed concern over the high dose and said that aspirin can prevent blood clots, but higher doses increase the risk of bleeding without added benefit. Trump’s physician, Dr Sean Barbabella, has said that the president “remains in exceptional health.”Trump also clarified reports about a medical scan he had in October, stating it was a routine CT scan, not an MRI as some had suggested. “It wasn’t an MRI. It was less than that. It was a scan,” he said. The scan reportedly showed normal results for his cardiovascular and abdominal systems.Trump addressed other health issues, including swelling in his legs due to chronic venous insufficiency. He said he stopped wearing compression socks recommended by doctors because “I didn’t like them.”Furthermore, Trump dismissed concerns about appearing to doze off at public events, saying, “I’ll just close. It’s very relaxing to me. Sometimes they’ll take a picture of me blinking, blinking, and they’ll catch me with the blink.”He also downplayed hearing difficulties, saying he struggles “when there’s a lot of people talking,” but otherwise hears normally.","The soon-to-be 80-year-old GOP leader is an avid golfer and considers playing golf his form of exercise.
