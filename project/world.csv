His video speeches have been taken out of context,” Angmo said. “The NSA charge sheet cites several videos, but we have provided full versions with subtitles and transcripts to show that the allegations are baseless.”Angmo, co-founder of Himalayan Institute of Alternatives, Ladakh, said one of the videos cited by authorities was “grossly misinterpreted”. “In one clip, he refers to revolutions in Bangladesh and Nepal and Gen Z but clearly says ours should be peaceful. Authorities twisted this to claim he was calling for similar protests in Ladakh,” she said.Wangchuk began a 35-day hunger strike for Sixth Schedule safeguards and statehood on Sept 9, accusing Centre of delaying talks on Ladakh’s democratic rights. The home ministry had announced a new round of talks for Oct 6, but violence broke out on Sept 24, prompting him to break his fast. Authorities later arrested more than 70 people, including Wangchuk, who was subsequently moved to Jodhpur jail.Angmo said her husband’s case “is not about law and order but about silencing a voice that speaks for Ladakh’s people”.“NSA is meant for terrorists and smugglers,” Angmo said. “We have clearly stated that Sonam poses no threat, has never been a threat, and his arrest is an attempt to silence his voice and the peaceful movement for Ladakh’s statehood.”She questioned the timing and relevance of the charges. “The FIRs mentioned are old, and the videos are one year old. How can such videos incite a protest now?” she asked.She said 11 videos were listed, including unrelated ones. “For instance, during last year’s long march, Sonam was held briefly in New Delhi. When some youths in Ladakh observed a spontaneous bandh, it was attributed to him and his supporters. People love him — their actions were voluntary,” she said.According to Angmo, officials also misread Wangchuk’s remarks on the Ladakh Scouts. “They allege he demotivated the force in case of war with Pakistan or China. What he actually said was that border residents should be kept content so they can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Army,” she said.Angmo said another video was misquoted to suggest Wangchuk urged confrontation with China. “In reality, he was quoting a comedian and rejecting that view. He clarified that while one may differ with any political party, we will always stand with India and its Army,” she said.The representation was drafted by senior lawyer and Congress RS MP Vivek Tankha and others. He later wrote on X: “How can Govt even conceive detaining @Wangchuk66 (a Gandhian) under NSA after the kind of exemplary work he has done in Ladhak….

Will the president decide his own payout?





Trump filed multimillion-dollar claims against DOJ before reelection





The New York Times





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that his Justice Department might owe $230 million — and he’d be the one to decide whether to cut himself a check.Trump is seeking $230 million as compensation for past investigations into him, though he professed to have little knowledge of the specifics and said he would give the money to charity.“It could be,” Trump responded when asked by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins about a New York Times report that he was seeking the money in connection with complaints he had filed about past DOJ investigations.“I don’t know about the numbers. I don’t even talk to them about it. All I know is that they would owe me a lot of money. But I’m not looking for money. I’d give it to charity or something,” Trump said in the Oval Office.Though many of the details remain unclear, Trump acknowledged the unprecedented nature of the situation in which he would be potentially “paying myself” damages to resolve claims that the DOJ under his predecessor had wronged him.""That decision would have to go across my desk. And it's awfully strange to make a decision where I'm paying myself. In other words, did you ever have one of those cases where you have to decide how much you’re paying yourself in damages?"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the report.""But I was damaged very greatly.""As a private citizen, President claimed he was entitled to money from the government.As president, he could now, in effect, order that government to pay him. If the payment came in the form of a settlement, the White House might be under no legal obligation to disclose it to the public, the Washington Post reported.The New York Times reported Tuesday on that Trump was seeking $230 million in compensation and that any settlement might be approved by Justice Department officials who defended Trump, or those around him, during the investigations.Trump first lodged the complaints in 2023 and 2024 — before his reelection — alleging that he was wronged by past federal investigations,reported.The first claim centers on alleged violations of his rights during the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The second focuses on the classified documents case, which was dismissed after his return to office, and accuses the FBI of breaching his privacy during the 2022 search of his Mar-a-Lago estate. That filing reportedly sought $100 million in damages, as per CNN.“President Trump continues to fight back against all Democrat-led witch hunts,” his legal spokesperson said, calling the investigations part of the “weaponization of our justice system by Crooked Joe Biden and his handlers.”The Times noted it remains unclear whether Trump or his lawyers have taken new steps to pursue payment. Both filings were made under an administrative process that allows citizens to seek compensation from federal agencies — a procedure separate from a court lawsuit.Complicating matters, two senior Justice Department officials who could now review Trump’s claims previously defended him or his associates. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche served as Trump’s criminal defense attorney, while Civil Division chief Stanley Woodward represented one of Trump’s co-defendants in the classified documents case.","Trump is seeking $230 million as compensation for past investigations into him, though he professed to have little knowledge of the specifics and said he would give the money to charity.

After the ""racist and pro Nazi"" chats leaked, US President Donald Trump ’s pick to lead a federal watchdog agency withdrew from consideration Tuesday evening.Paul Ingrassia had been scheduled to attend his confirmation hearing with the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs (HSGAC) during the week. However, on Monday, Politico reported a text conversation in which Ingrassia said some racist comments.Politico revealed that Ingrassia said that the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday should be “tossed into the seventh circle of hell and referring to former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy , said: “Never trust a chinaman or Indian."" The texts also showed Ingrassia describing himself in the chat as having “a Nazi streak” at times.After the texts were made public, several Republican senators, including some of President Trump’s most conservative allies in the Senate, announced they would not support his nomination.“I will be withdrawing myself from Thursday’s HSGAC hearing to lead the Office of Special Counsel because unfortunately I do not have enough Republican votes at this time,” Ingrassia posted in an online message.“I appreciate the overwhelming support that I have received throughout the process and will continue to serve President Trump and the administration to Make America Great Again!”Ingrassia’s withdrawal followed remarks from Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who expressed hope that the White House would retract his nomination.While Republicans have generally succeeded in advancing the majority of President Trump’s nominees in roll call votes despite strong Democratic opposition, there have been occasional instances of internal resistance, typically behind the scenes, indicating limits to their support.Paul Joseph Ingrassia is an American attorney and political commentator who, as of 2025, served as White House liaison to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).He also briefly served as liaison to the Department of Justice earlier that year.Ingrassia studied mathematics and economics at Fordham University before attending Cornell Law School, where he served as senior online editor for the Cornell Journal of Law and Public Policy.He is known for his conservative political views and has contributed writings to outlets like National Review and The Daily Caller. Ingrassia co-hosted a podcast and gained attention for controversial political commentary frequently cited and shared by former President Donald Trump.In May-2025, Trump nominated Ingrassia to lead the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency responsible for protecting federal whistleblowers and enforcing civil service laws.The White House indefinitely paused the judicial nomination of former Florida Deputy Attorney General John Guard due to his involvement with a charity under criminal investigation, Axios reported on Monday.Trump also withdrew economist E.J.

CNN

“You know, we’re building right behind us, we’re building a ballroom. They wanted a ballroom for 150 years, and I’m giving that honor to this wonderful place,” he said. “I didn’t know I’d be standing here right now, because right on the other side, you have a lot of construction going on, which you might hear periodically.”

Funding and donor support for the White House Ballroom





“It will be in keeping with the White House architecture,” Trump said. “It will be appropriate in color and in window shape. There won’t be anything like it actually. … You know, a new thing is you build a super modern building next to an old-fashioned building, and I think that’s good, but I don’t have the courage to do that with the White House.”?

“I said, ‘How long will it take me?’ ‘Sir, you can start tonight, you have no approvals.’ I said, ‘You gotta be kidding.’ They said, ‘Sir, this is the White House, you’re the president of the United States, you can do anything you want.’”

Construction has officially begun on President Donald J. Trump’s long-anticipated White House ballroom, a sprawling $250 million project that marks one of the most ambitious structural changes to the presidential residence in over a century. The move, confirmed through a statement posted by the White House on Truth Social, coincides with visible demolition activity on parts of the East Wing, where excavators and construction crews have been working since Monday.For the first time in the history of the White House, a permanent ballroom is being constructed on the grounds, a dream Trump said had been shared by every U.S. president for more than 150 years.“I am pleased to announce that ground has been broken on the White House grounds to build the new, big, beautiful White House Ballroom,” the president announced in a post shared on Truth Social and reposted by the official White House account. “Completely separate from the White House itself, the East Wing is being fully modernized as part of this process, and will be more beautiful than ever when it is complete! For more than 150 years, every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom at the White House to accommodate people for grand parties, State Visits, etc.I am honored to be the first President to finally get this much-needed project underway, with zero cost to the American Taxpayer! The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly. This Ballroom will be happily used for Generations to come!”The ballroom, spanning approximately 90,000 square feet (8,300 square meters), is being built over the area that currently houses the East Wing. Renderings released by the White House depict a vast, neoclassical-style interior with gold and crystal chandeliers, gilded Corinthian columns, a coffered ceiling with gold inlays, marble floors, and three walls of arched windows overlooking the South Grounds.Demolition began on October 20, 2025, when construction crews and excavators were seen tearing down sections of the East Wing façade, including parts of the roof, entryway, and windows. Photos obtained by multiple outlets, includingand, showed visible demolition activity and portions of the structure’s interior being removed.The East Wing, which was constructed in 1902 and last modified in 1942 during Franklin D. Roosevelt’s presidency, has long served as the location of the First Lady’s offices. Under Trump’s modernization plan, this wing will be “fully modernized” as part of the ballroom development. According to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, the state ballroom will accommodate up to 650 seated guests, more than triple the capacity of the current East Room, which has historically been the largest event space in the White House.At a ceremony honoring Louisiana State University’s NCAA baseball champions in the East Room earlier Monday, Trump spoke about the construction:The president has emphasized that the ballroom’s construction will come at “zero cost to the American taxpayer,” financed entirely by private donors, major U.S. corporations, and Trump himself.During a recent White House donor dinner attended by representatives from Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, Microsoft, Palantir, and Lockheed Martin, Trump unveiled further design plans and confirmed that the new venue will feature bulletproof glass, a 1,000-person capacity, and the ability to host a future presidential inauguration.He assured guests that the structure would align with the mansion’s historic architecture:When asked about regulatory procedures, Trump recalled:The ballroom project, estimated between $200 million and $250 million, is expected to be completed before the end of Trump’s second term in January 2029.The White House stated that the ballroom will maintain the “theme and architectural heritage” of the neoclassical executive mansion. Plans call for a separate structure, adjacent but “not touching” the existing White House.“It won’t interfere with the current building,” Trump said in July. “It’ll be near it but not touching it, and pays total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of. It’s my favorite place. I love it.”Still, images of the demolition sparked controversy across social media, with some critics, including one former lawmaker, calling the project an “utter desecration.” Despite the criticism, Trump’s supporters and donors have lauded the expansion as a “historic upgrade” to one of America’s most iconic buildings.The East Wing renovation marks the largest physical modification to the White House in over 80 years, rivaling the 1948 Truman reconstruction and the 1990s West Wing refurbishments.The ballroom is part of a broader effort by Trump to reimagine Washington’s landmarks and leave a symbolic architectural legacy.At a fundraiser for ballroom donors earlier this month, Trump also unveiled a 3D model of a monument called the “Arc de Trump,” designed to resemble Paris’s Arc de Triomphe. He said the arch, topped with a gold statue, will be located across from the Lincoln Memorial and will “serve as a gateway to Washington while entering via the Arlington Memorial Bridge from Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.”The Arc de Trump is proposed to commemorate the United States’ 250th anniversary in 2026 and, like the ballroom, will be privately funded by supporters.Throughout his presidency, Trump, a former real estate developer, has personally overseen numerous aesthetic and structural updates to the White House, including:","The White House ballroom is expected to be completed before the end of President Trump’s second term, in January 2029. The ballroom, spanning approximately 90,000 square feet (8,300 square meters), is being built over the area that currently houses the East Wing. Renderings released by the White House depict a vast, neoclassical-style interior with gold and crystal chandeliers, Corinthian columns, and marble floors.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124711313,imgsize-1325658,width-400,resizemode-4/white-house-demolition-east-wing-expansion.jpg"

Will Canada buy German-made submarines?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/will-canada-buy-german-made-submarines/articleshow/124732946.cms,"German defence minister Boris Pistorius (Image credits: AP)

A new Cold War



Tracking Russian submarines from Iceland



Rare earths as well as defence



Is the Bundeswehr overextended?



No decision yet







In the Canadian capital, Ottawa, on Monday, the defence ministers of Norway and Germany, Tore Sandvik and Boris Pistorius , received military honors from their Canadian counterpart, David McGuinty, at the start of what might informally be described as a sales presentation.Sandvik and Pistorius want to convince the Canadians to join a German–Norwegian project that has been running since 2023, to procure standardised, modern submarines. They hope to secure an order from Canada of up to 12 units over the next 10 years.This would provide a significant boost to the German and Norwegian companies that are building these submarines. As McGuinty pointed out, if Canada came on board, production numbers could be substantially increased, and this would reduce the cost of each submarine.The German delegation believes that going into partnership on submarine construction would clearly signal a strengthening of North Atlantic naval cooperation. Last year, Germany, Norway, and Canada formally established a maritime security partnership, which Denmark also joined this year.After the end of the Cold War, submarines in the Atlantic were no longer considered a priority, and Germany drastically reduced its fleet.However, with Russia once again regarded as a significant threat in the Baltic Sea and the North Atlantic, the submarine fleet is growing. And the emphasis is not just on submarines. German defence minister Pistorius said that northern Nato countries were strengthening their commitment to protect critical infrastructure, such as undersea cables and offshore wind farms, and detect Russian submarines in the North Atlantic.""Russia's ambition will not stop in eastern Ukraine or at the eastern flank,"" he said. ""The civilian and military lines of communication across the North Atlantic are vitally important […] for our economy and our defence alliance with Canada and the United States.""The German navy is to increase its presence, with more ships in the waters around the Arctic Circle. Special P-8 Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft, which can detect submarines over great distances, will be deployed more frequently from Iceland.Pistorius co-signed a declaration of intent to this effect while on a brief visit to Reykjavik on Sunday, with Iceland's foreign minister, Katrin Gunnarsdottir.The US navy operates the large Keflavik base in Iceland, from which the North Atlantic is monitored. Various Nato countries send reconnaissance aircraft to Keflavik, in rotation. The US shut down the base in 2006, but reopened it in 2016 in view of the growing threat from Russia.Although Iceland is a member of Nato, it does not have a military of its own, so any external support is very welcome. In return, it provides logistical assistance at its ports, accommodation, and training grounds for German soldiers.During the talks in Canada, Pistorius also pushed for an expansion of the strategic and economic partnership. This partnership was only formalised in August, when the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney was in Berlin to meet with the German chancellor Friedrich Merz.Canada could, for example, export more liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Europe. Germany is keen to reciprocate by assisting with the exploration and extraction of coveted rare earth elements.These metals are needed primarily for high-end electronics and microchips. At the meeting in Ottawa, the Canadian side commented that its European allies were keen to reduce their dependence on China, and the United States.US President Donald Trump has imposed high tariffs on Canadian imports. Until recently, the US was by far the largest customer for Canada's goods and raw materials, accounting for 75% of its volume of trade. That is now starting to change. Canadian diplomats say Canada will be focusing more on Europe in future.When asked by a journalist whether the German Bundeswehr (armed forces) risks becoming overextended, with so many foreign commitments, in Lithuania, the Baltic Sea, Canada, and Iceland, Pistorius responded with a smile. This, he said, was ""a typically German question."" He pointed out that Germany was the largest Nato country in Europe, and, as such: ""We have to bear more of the burden. We have to demonstrate that. ""Pistorius explained that the Bundeswehr can't be everywhere. It has to prioritise. ""Just as other Nato countries focus more on the south, the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, or North Africa, we are focused on the Baltic Sea, the Baltic region, the eastern flank, and the Nordic countries.""He then affirmed that: ""We will be in a position to manage all this with our current personnel, and the personnel we will add in future.""Following the talks in Ottawa, Canada still has not made a decision about joining the submarine project with Germany and Norway. In the coming days, the Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, is due to travel to South Korea, where he will be met with another big sales presentation. South Korea is also keen to secure an order for 12 new submarines from Canada.After a long day of negotiations, Canadian defence minister McGuinty addressed his German and Norwegian counterparts, but without going into specifics. ""This partnership is active, it is evolving. It is vital to addressing today's global challenges,"" he said.German defence minister Pistorius said only: ""It's looking hopeful.""",Tore Sandvik and Boris Pistorius want to convince Canada to join a submarine project.

NEW YORK: An immigration enforcement sweep targeting vendors on Manhattan's famed Canal Street turned chaotic on Tuesday after droves of angry New Yorkers surrounded federal agents and attempted to block them from driving off, prompting arrests and fierce standoffs along a bustling downtown corridor.The confrontation began shortly after 4 p.m., as federal agents fanned out across a section of Chinatown that has long served as a not-so-underground market for knock-off designer handbags, watches, perfumes, electronics and other goods.An Associated Press reporter observed dozens of agents detaining a street vendor selling bedazzled smartphone cases, one of a number of arrests in the area.In response, a contingent of protesters, many of whom appeared to be on their way home from work, surrounded the masked officers, attempting to block their vehicle as they shouted ""ICE out of New York"" and called on other pedestrians to join them.Agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Border Patrol and other federal offices then tried to clear the streets, in some cases shoving protesters to the ground and threatening them with pepper spray before detaining them.As more New Yorkers joined the fray, some of the federal agents retreated on foot, followed by jeering protesters and honking vehicles. Additional federal agents, armed with long guns and tactical gear, also arrived in a military tactical vehicle.Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said the agents were conducting an enforcement operation against sellers of ""counterfeit goods""""During this law enforcement operation, rioters who were shouting obscenities, became violent and obstructed law enforcement duties including blocking vehicles and assaulting law enforcement,"" she said.At least one person was arrested for assaulting an officer, McLaughlin said. She did not respond to a request about how many vendors were detained.The sweep came days after a conservative influencer shared video on X showing a group of men selling bags on the street, urging the official ICE account to ""check this corner out.""While clashes between immigration authorities and protesters have played out in Los Angeles and other cities, such scenes have been rarer on New York City streets, which Mayor Eric Adams has attributed in part to his working relationship with President Donald Trump's administration.Trump has threatened to send federal troops to the city if Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, wins election in two weeks.An FBI spokesperson said Tuesday that special agents were involved with immigration enforcement efforts in New York in response to a request from DHS to help with ""major operations.""Mayor Eric Adams said the city had no involvement in the sweep Tuesday and was still gathering details.""Our administration has been clear that undocumented New Yorkers trying to pursue their American Dreams should not be the target of law enforcement, and resources should instead be focused on violent criminals,"" he said.In a statement, Murad Awawdeh, president of the New York Immigration Coalition, accused the Trump administration of trying to create a ""violent spectacle"" on the city's streets.""This operation had nothing to do with public safety and everything to do with terrorizing immigrant families and communities,"" he said.","Immigration agents targeted vendors on Manhattan's famed Canal Street.

How does Tanzania 's electoral system work?



Who could take the presidency?



Key concerns for voters



How previous elections have gone



Opposition suppressed







Tanzania has a first-past-the-post system, with the president and vice president jointly and directly elected via simple majority popular vote. They serve five-year terms, which are renewable once.The October 29, 2025 election is a little unusual, because current President Samia Suluhu Hassan is competing in her first presidential election . She took over as president upon the death of President John Magufuli in 2021. Hassan, the first woman to lead Tanzania, was his deputy.Tanzania has a special relationship with the semi-autonomous island of Zanzibar, off the coast to the east. While the mainland and Zanzibar have formed the United Republic of Tanzania since 1964, the territories have considerable differences in populations, colonial history, religious makeup and economy.For example, Zanzibar's population counts for approximately 1.9 million out of Tanzania's total population of 68 million. Around 98% of Zanzibaris are Muslim, while around 63% of Tanzanians in total are Christians.As such, of the 264 members of parliament directly elected to represent constituencies, 214 are reserved for mainland and 50 for Zanzibar. Women are allocated 113 additional seats in parliament, and are indirectly chosen by their respective parties.Seventeen candidates and their parties are officially running. However, Hassan of the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party is the only nationally recognised candidate, and the two main opposition parties, Chadema and ACT-Wazalendo (Alliance for Change and Transparency), have been barred.Major candidates from both parties have also been banned from standing for election.Tanzania has made significant strides in building roads, power lines, rail and internet access, but there's still a considerable gulf between rural communities and growing urban areas.Service delivery, from access to clean water to reliable electricity, and a gap in educational and employment opportunities are key issues for voters. Some say that despite close on five decades of rule, the CCM has not delivered on promises.Tanzania is East Africa's most populous nation, and demographic trends place the country among the fastest-growing populations globally.Young, upwardly mobile voters are increasingly making their voices heard. But concerns persist over voter apathy, or reluctance to vote, because the CCM has stifled dissent.An intriguing prospect is how the 2025 election will reflect Hassan's standing within her own party, and how its politicians jostle for position.The CCM has effectively been in power since Tanzania's independence from Britain in 1961. It is considered the party of Julius Nyerere, still a figure held in high regard. Analysts see the CCM as the last of Africa's liberation era parties still competing and dominating elections.From 1977 to 1992 Tanzania was a one-party state, with CCM, essentially a merger of the Tanganyika National Union and the Zanzibari Afro-Shirazi Party, holding sway.Chadema's best election result came in 2015 when its presidential candidate, Edward Lowassa, won almost 40% of the vote, lagging behind Magufuli's 58%. In 2020, the opposition party saw its vote share shrink to just 13%, with its leaders claiming voting irregularities.Hassan was praised after coming to power in 2021 for easing repression of political opponents and censorship of the media, which had become associated with Magufuli's legacy. In 2023, she lifted his ban on opposition-led rallies, and she has been hailed for a number of reforms.However, Hassan is now facing growing criticism over the alleged state-sanctioned abductions and arrests of human rights activists and opposition politicians. Chadema leader Tundu Lissu is on trial for treason, after his arrest this past April while calling for electoral reforms.Humphrey Hesron Polepole, a vocal government critic and the former Tanzanian ambassador to Cuba, went missing in October. Senior Chadema official Ali Mohamed Kibao was abducted in September 2024 and found dead. In the run-up to the 2025 vote,Human Rights Watch has warned of ""deepening repression"" threatening the election, while Amnesty International said it had documented ""systemic human rights violations"" by authorities, which includes ""enforced disappearance and torture"" and ""extrajudicial killings of opposition figures and activists.""","Tanzania has a first-past-the-post system, with the president and vice president jointly and directly elected via simple majority popular vote.

Jeri stated that the measure allows the armed forces to assist the police in maintaining public order, though he provided no further details.""We are moving from defence to offence in the fight against crime, a fight that will allow us to regain peace, tranquility, and the trust of millions of Peruvians,"" he said.Under the state of emergency, the government can deploy the military to patrol streets and impose restrictions on gatherings and other civil liberties.This marks the first major action by the interim president since taking office nearly two weeks ago to tackle the escalating crime crisis.Jeri was sworn in earlier this month following the removal of former President Dina Boluarte and unveiled a new cabinet last week, pledging to make tackling crime a top priority. He has already faced his first major protest, led by civil society groups and young people from ""Generation Z,"" demanding action against rising crime.This is not the first time Peru has imposed a state of emergency to address security concerns.Lima was previously placed under a partial state of emergency from March to July following the murder of a well-known musician, a crime linked to organized criminal activity, as cited by France24.Over the past month, protests in Peru have left more than 200 people injured, including police officers, demonstrators, and journalists, and one man was shot dead by police.The country’s escalating security crisis, which has particularly affected the transportation sector, with at least 47 bus drivers killed this year in suspected extortion-related attacks, prompted the dismissal of former President Boluarte on October 10.","Peru’s President Jose Jeri announced a 30-day state of emergency on Tuesday in the capital, Lima, and the nearby province of Callao.

Trump Aide’s ‘Unhinged’ Criticism ‘Prompts’ China To Shake Up Trade Team; Xi’s Rare Move





Amid an escalating tariff war with Beijing, US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he wants to be “nice” to China but claimed that the country has been “very rough” with the United States over the years because America “never had smart presidents from a business standpoint. ”The 79-year-old businessman-turned-president made the remarks while responding to a question from ANI on whether Washington would impose tariffs on China for buying crude oil from Russia. The comments came during Diwali celebrations at the White House, where Trump lit ceremonial lamps.“I want to be nice to China. But China has been very rough with us over the years because we had presidents that weren’t smart from a business standpoint. They allowed China and every other country to take advantage of us,” Trump said.He added that starting November 1, China could face tariffs of about 155%, calling the situation “unsustainable” for Beijing. Trump argued that his tariff policies have boosted US national security and brought in “hundreds of billions, even trillions of dollars” in revenue.“We’re getting hundreds of billions, even trillions of dollars paid into the United States...We’ll start paying off debt,” he said, adding that the administration might soon make a “distribution” from tariff earnings to American citizens.Trump further claimed that the United States had collected $650 billion from the European Union, $550 billion from Japan and $350 billion from South Korea through trade duties.“Now we’re taking a lot of money, and it keeps people like this here because that’s why they’re coming in,” he remarked.During the same interaction, Trump said he had spoken to Prime Minister Narendra Modi , asserting that India had “cut back” on buying Russian oil.“He’s not going to buy much oil from Russia. He wants to see that war end as much as I do,” Trump said, referring to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.Trump’s latest remarks came a day after he said he wanted to strike a “fair” and “fantastic” trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping, while also warning that Beijing could be in “big trouble” if it avoided doing business with the US.“If they don’t do business with us, I think China is in big trouble… I want them to do great. I want them to thrive. But we have to thrive together. It’s a two-way street,” he said earlier this week.Since returning to the White House, Trump has already imposed additional 30% tariffs on Chinese goods, bringing total duties to around 55–57%.He has also warned that the rate could rise further if talks fail. The White House says the tariff measures have earned the US “respect” from Beijing, while Chinese officials have dismissed the approach as counterproductive.The confrontation follows China’s decision to tighten export controls on rare earth elements, citing national security. The US responded by hiking import tariffs on Chinese goods by 100%, raising the total rate on some products to nearly 130%.Earlier this week, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that as many as 85 senators were ready to back Trump’s authority to impose tariffs of up to 500% on Chinese imports over Beijing’s energy trade with Russia, a move that could further escalate tensions between the world’s two largest economies.On Tuesday, the president said he expects to finalize a “good” trade deal with President Xi at next week’s APEC summit in South Korea, adding that he anticipates “a very successful meeting” and noting that “a lot of people… are waiting for it.”He added, however, that the outcome was not guaranteed, saying, “Maybe it won't happen. Things can happen where, for instance, somebody may decline to meet, saying it’s ‘too nasty.’ But it’s really not nasty.”",US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he wants to be “nice” to China.

During a recent meeting in Washington, US President Donald Trump reportedly pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to consider relinquishing the eastern Donbas region in exchange for peace, according to a senior Ukrainian official speaking to AFP.The discussions, described as ""tense"" and ""not easy,"" highlighted the ongoing challenges in diplomatic efforts to resolve the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which the source said felt like they were ""dragged out"" and ""going in circles.""When questioned about whether Trump had suggested Zelenskyy withdraw from Ukrainian-controlled land, a key demand of Putin, the Ukrainian official confirmed the claim to AFP, stating, ""Yes, that's true.""Following the meeting, Trump took to social media to describe the talks as ""very interesting, and cordial,"" adding that he had advised both Zelenskyy and Putin that ""it is time to stop the killing, and make a DEAL!"" Despite Trump's promise to end Russia's three-and-a-half-year invasion within ""24 hours"" of his inauguration in January, he has yet to secure any concessions from Putin. His stance on the conflict has shifted multiple times following discussions with both leaders in conflict.European officials briefed on the meeting added that Trump appeared to echo many of Putin’s talking points almost word for word, even when they conflicted with his own recent comments about Russia’s vulnerabilities. According to a European official familiar with the discussion, Trump told Zelenskyy that Putin described the conflict as a “special operation, not even a war,” and warned that Ukraine needed to strike a deal or risk annihilation. The official added that Trump also told Zelenskyy he was losing the war, cautioning: “If [Putin] wants it, he will destroy you.” At one point, the official said, the US president even tossed Ukraine’s battlefield maps aside.Zelenskyy's visit to the White House last week was aimed at leveraging Trump's increasing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin's resistance to a ceasefire. However, the Ukrainian leader left without securing any commitments, as Trump, who had spoken with Putin the previous day, declined Zelenskyy's request for long-range Tomahawk missiles and instead pressured him to consider a territorial concession.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with US President Donald Trump at the White House last week.

Trump Says He Spoke To PM Modi On Diwali, Repeats Russian Oil Remark





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said India is not going to be buying “too much oil” from Moscow, suggesting that he had received assurances from Prime Minister Narendra Modi that New Delhi would be tapering Russian oil purchases without completely stopping the transactions.“I spoke to Prime Minister Modi today and we just have a very good relationship. He's not going to buy much oil from Russia. He wants to see that war (between Russia and Ukraine) end as much as I do. They're not going to be buying too much oil,"" Trump said at a White House Diwali event at which he lit a diya (lamp) in the Oval Office.""So they've cut it way back, and they're continuing to cut it way back..."" he added.The US President appeared to dial down his earlier claims that India would halt buying Russian oil completely (“a big stop” he called it), with the latest comments providing some wiggle room for both sides to press ahead with direct talks on trade and tariffs. Oil trade circles are not reporting any significant tapering in Indian oil purchases from Russia, much of which is routed through private players with future contracts.“I love the people of India. We're working on some great deals between our countries,” Trump said, as he greeted the people of India on Diwali while celebrating the festival of lights in the White House with a flock of Indian-Americans in the administration and corporate world, seeming also to want to repair some of the self-inflicted damage to his ratings in a country where he had a high approval numbers before the tariff tantrums.The two leaders could meet as soon as early next week on the sidelines of the Asean summit in Malaysia where Trump is heading to over the weekend. PM Modi’s trip has not been announced and could depend on whether the two leaders have something substantive on hand beyond mere optics, handshakes, and hugs.Leaders of Russia, China, and India appear to be leery of meeting Trump because of what some diplomats say is lack of serious preparation by US interlocutors and his penchant for grandstanding before the media.Trump also dropped a clanger at the Diwali event by disclosing he and Modi talked about “let’s have no war with Pakistan.” New Delhi prefers to deal with Islamabad on a bilateral basis and has made it clear that Pakistan cannot inflict terror attacks on India under a nuclear umbrella.“He’s a great person and he’s become a great friend of mine,” Trump said of Modi, in line with his personalized approach to countries he is at odds with, including China, Russia, and Brazil.At the same event, he also reeled back a meeting he had announced with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Budapest, saying it would be a waste of time and he did not want an unproductive meeting.Trump wants Russia and Ukraine to agree to a ceasefire at current battlefront, but Moscow has indicated it needs guarantees that Ukraine will remain neutral and not be drafted into NATO, conditions that are unacceptable to Kiev and its European partners who fear future Russian transgressions.",US President Donald Trump said India is not going to be buying “too much oil” from Moscow.

A 55-year-old Palestinian woman was hospitalised after a masked Jewish settler struck her on the head while she was picking olives.The unprovoked attack took place on Sunday morning in the Palestinian village of Turmus Ayya in the occupied West Bank and was captured on video by US journalist Jasper Nathaniel.Nathaniel said the settler struck the woman unconscious with a stick and hit her again as she lay on the ground. He rejected claims that Israeli soldiers intervened, saying, “no Israeli forces showed up to the attack at any point.”According to Nathaniel, soldiers had been present before the assault and had “lured” him and others into an “ambush” before driving away moments prior to the settlers’ attack.Footage shows the assailant wielding a large wooden stick with a knotted end, resembling a club, which he swings overhead before striking Abu Alia.""It's the most vivid image that's ever been seared in my mind,"" Nathaniel was quoted as saying by the BBC. ""He swings it one time and I saw her body go completely limp. And then he stood over her and hit her twice more.""The assault was part of a larger incident involving at least 15 masked settlers who threw stones and attacked Palestinian olive harvesters and activists, including Nathaniel. One car was set on fire, and several others had their windows smashed.The UN and rights groups have warned that Palestinian farmers face increasing risks as the olive harvest season begins.“Settler violence has skyrocketed in scale and frequency,” stated Ajith Sunghay, the head of the UN Human Rights Office in the Palestinian territory on Tuesday.Turmus Ayya, a predominantly Palestinian-American village situated in a valley surrounded by Israeli settlements, has long been targeted by settler violence, which residents say has escalated amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict.The United Nations reports that the first half of 2025 saw 757 settler attacks resulting in casualties or property damage, marking a 13 percent increase compared with the same period last year.During the opening week of the olive harvest, more than 150 attacks were recorded, with over 700 olive trees reportedly uprooted, damaged, or poisoned, according to Muayyad Shaaban, head of a Palestinian Authority office monitoring the violence, as cited by AP Israel captured the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East War.

What was the case against Uribe?





Uribe charges deepen US-Colombia rift









A Colombian court on Tuesday overturned convictions against former President Alvaro Uribe for bribery and witness tampering.Uribe, who served as Colombia's president from 2002 to 2010, was sentenced to 12 years of house arrest after being found guilty in August.Last month, Colombia's supreme court ordered Uribe's release from detention until his appeals were heard.He was the first former Colombian president to be convicted of criminal charges.The Bogota High Court said that the charges had not been demonstrated ""beyond reasonable doubt.""""It was not proven directly or indirectly that Alvaro Uribe instigated the crime of bribery in criminal proceedings ... therefore, the court will overturn the sentence imposed on Alvaro Uribe Velez,"" judge Manuel Antonio Merchan said.The court concluded that the initial sentence had ""methodological errors, fallacies of interpretation and biased evaluation of evidence,"" adding it had amounted to ""inferences"" without ""objective support.""In 2012, Uribe accused leftist senator Ivan Cepeda of bribing former paramilitary members, who have since been jailed, to tie the ex-president to the right-wing groups.But the supreme court rejected Uribe's allegation and instead accused him of having pressured witnesses.Cepeda has said he would appeal Tuesday's ruling, which will take the case to Colombia's top court.Uribe's time in office was marked by a military campaign against left-wing guerillas and drug cartels.The paramilitaries were founded by cattle ranchers, landowners and merchants to fight leftist guerilla groups such as the FARC.They have been accused of killing over 450,000 between 1985 and 2018.Uribe has alleged that the charges were born out of political persecution against him.US secretary of state Marco Rubio expressed his support for the embattled former right-wing president, saying that the case was an example of ""weaponization"" by Colombian judges.In response, left-wing President Gustavo Petro called for Washington to respect the independence of Colombia's judiciary.It comes amid a broader rift between the two countries, with US President Donald Trump threatening tariffs against Colombia over accusations of involvement of drug trafficking.","Colombian court overturns convictions against former President Alvaro Uribe.

A month after former White House press secretary Jen Psaki and Vice President JD Vance clashed over the deadly Minneapolis school shooting, the two seems to face off once more—this time on a more personal stage.MSNBC host Jen Psaki on Tuesday joked about the perceived threat posed by Vice President JD Vance during the ""I've Had It"" podcast. Psaki and the podcast hosts expressed concern over Vance's role in the Trump administration.“I always wonder what's going on in the mind of his wife. Like, are you okay? Please blink four times. We'll come over here. We'll save you.”She continued, “And that he's willing to do anything to get there. And your whole iteration you just outlined, I mean, he's scarier in certain ways in some ways.

‘I’m not a secret Nazi’: Graham Platner says he will remove tattoo resembling Nazi symbol — what is the ‘Totenkopf’?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/im-not-a-secret-nazi-graham-platner-says-he-will-remove-tattoo-resembling-nazi-symbol-what-is-the-totenkopf/articleshow/124731511.cms,"What is Totenkopf ?



Who is Graham Platner?







Graham Platner, the Democratic Senate hopeful from Maine, expressed regret over getting a tattoo that appears similar to a Nazi symbol nearly two decades ago and posted it on Reddit, which has resurfaced.Platner said that he planned to remove the tattoo after questions were raised, including from a former top campaign staffer, about how he could have been unaware of its connotations.Platner’s campaign sought to preempt opposition research regarding his tattoo, which resembles a Nazi skull and crossbones, during an appearance on the liberal podcast Pod Save America on Monday. His campaign shared a video of him dancing shirtless. Platner stated that he was unaware of any Nazi link when he got the tattoo.He emphasized in the interview that he was “not a secret Nazi” and pointed to his Reddit comment history as evidence of his opposition to Nazism, antisemitism and racism. “I would say a lifelong opponent,” he stated.The tattoo revelation came after Platner apologized last week for a series of offensive Reddit posts spanning 2013 to 2021. On Friday, he issued a video apology for posts like calling police officers “bastards”, questioning why Black people tip less, and appearing to agree with characterizations of rural white voters as “racist” and “stupid”.“It was not until I started hearing from reporters and DC insiders that I realized this tattoo resembled a Nazi symbol,” Platner said in a statement to POLITICO on Tuesday.“I absolutely would not have gone through life having this on my chest if I knew that — and to insinuate that I did is disgusting. I am already planning to get this removed.”Platner reiterated that he obtained the tattoo while out drinking with fellow Marines in Croatia, choosing the skull and crossbones off a wall at the tattoo parlor.He claimed the similarity to Nazi iconography never arose, including during physical examinations mandated by the US Army, which prohibits tattoos of identified hate symbols. “In the nearly 20 years since, this hasn’t come up,” Platner said.The tattoo in question resembles the Totenkopf, or “death’s head” symbol. “Totenkopf” is a German word typically referring to an image of a skull and crossbones. During the Nazi era, one form of the image was adopted by Hitler’s SS during the Nazi era and became particularly associated with the SS-Totenkopfverbande, the branch responsible for guarding concentration camps, according to the Anti-Defamation League.Graham Platner is a Marine and US Army veteran, oyster farmer, and chair of the Sullivan Planning Board, now running for US Senate in Maine to challenge Susan Collins and reclaim the seat for working Mainers.After graduating high school in 2003, amid the Iraq War, Graham secretly took his birth certificate from his father’s office to enlist in the US Marine Corps. Following infantry training, he joined Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion 8th Marines, and deployed to Al-Anbar Province, Iraq, in January 2005, operating primarily east of Fallujah. In 2006, he served as a machine gun section leader in Ramadi’s Government Center and returned for a third deployment in 2007.Using the GI Bill, Graham enrolled at George Washington University after his deployments, but his military service wasn’t over. In 2009, he joined the Maryland Army National Guard and deployed to Afghanistan in 2010 as a rifle team leader.Returning from Afghanistan in 2011, Graham resumed studies at George Washington University but struggled with undiagnosed PTSD and combat-related physical challenges. He eventually withdrew and moved back to Maine, where he used VA resources to get the support he needed.After four overseas tours and growing disillusionment with America’s foreign policy, Graham shifted his focus to serving his local community. In 2018, he began working at a friend’s small oyster farm in Sullivan, Maine, and eventually took it over, growing it into a thriving business. He also started a diving and mooring service for the bay and serves as Sullivan’s Harbormaster and Planning Board Chair.In 2023, Graham met Amy Gertner, fell in love, and married her soon after. The couple lives in Sullivan—just three doors down from where Graham grew up—with their two dogs, Gryffin and Zevon, and their cat, Neptune.","Graham Platner, the Democratic Senate hopeful from Maine, expressed regret over getting a tattoo that appears similar to a Nazi symbol nearly two decades ago and posted it on Reddit.

Donald Trump pardoned January 6 rioter arrested for threatening to kill Hakeem Jeffries: 'Cannot allow this terrorist to live',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-pardoned-january-6-rioter-arrested-for-threatening-to-kill-hakeem-jeffries-cannot-allow-this-terrorist-to-live/articleshow/124729365.cms,"



A man from New York, who was pardoned by US President Donald Trump for his role in the January 6 Capitol attack, has been arrested for allegedly threatening to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, New York State Police said.34-year-old Christopher Moynihan was taken into custody on Saturday and charged with making terrorist like threats. He is the first pardoned Capitol rioter to face arrest over alleged political violence, reports ABC News.Investigators said Moynihan sent threatening text messages last week to an unidentified recipient. One message read, “Hakeem Jeffries makes a speech in a few days in NYC I cannot allow this terrorist to live.” Another said, “Even if I am hated he must be eliminated. I will kill him for the future.” The complaint said the messages “placed the recipient in reasonable fear of the imminent murder and assassination of Hakeem Jeffries by the defendant. ”Moynihan appeared in the Town of Clinton Court and was sent to the Dutchess County Justice and Transition Center with $10,000 cash bail. He is due to appear in Dutchess County State Supreme Court on Thursday.Jeffries said in a statement on Tuesday, “I am grateful to state and federal law enforcement for their swift and decisive action to apprehend a dangerous individual who made a credible death threat against me with every intention to carry it out.”Moynihan was convicted in 2022 of obstructing an official proceeding after breaking through a security perimeter and entering the Capitol on January 6. Prosecutors said he went into the Senate Gallery, looked through a notebook on a senator’s desk, and took photos with his cellphone. During the riot, he reportedly said, “There’s got to be something in here we can f---ing use against these ----bags.” He was sentenced to nearly two years in prison in February 2023 before receiving a pardon from Trump, along with more than 1,500 others who were convicted or charged in connection with the attack.Jeffries warned of rising political violence but said he would not be intimidated. “When it comes to these extremists out there, you better watch how you talk when you talk about me,” he said, adding, “we're living in a moment of extreme political violence” affecting public servants.","34-year-old Christopher Moynihan was taken into custody on Saturday and charged with making terrorist like threats.

​3 Migrants DEAD in 12 Days: Trump’s ICE Detention Nightmare Exposed Amid Allegations of Abuse





A US Marshal and an undocumented immigrant were shot during a federal operation in South Los Angeles on Tuesday, reports Fox 11.Both sustained injuries that are not considered life-threatening and were taken to the hospital for treatment.The incident occurred around 8:50 am in the 400 block of E. 20th Street in the Historic South-Central neighbourhood. Federal agents had surrounded a vehicle containing the suspect. Sources told Fox News that officers opened fire when the suspect allegedly rammed federal vehicles in an attempt to escape.The marshal was reportedly shot in the finger while the suspect was hit in the left arm. The Los Angeles police department confirmed that none of its officers were involved in the shooting. Santee High School was temporarily placed on lockdown after shots were fired.The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement describing the operation as a targeted enforcement traffic stop: ""This is a developing situation and information is preliminary: During a targeted enforcement traffic stop in the Los Angeles area, an [undocumented immigrant]—who had previously escaped from custody—attempted to evade arrest yet again.ICE law enforcement officers, assisted by U.S. Marshals, pulled the [undocumented immigrant] over in a standard law enforcement procedure. The [undocumented immigrant] weaponized his vehicle and began ramming the law enforcement vehicle in an attempt to flee. Fearing for the safety of the public and law enforcement, our officers followed their training and fired defensive shots. The [undocumented immigrant] was shot in the elbow and one law enforcement officer was shot in the hand by a ricochet bullet. Both are in the hospital.""The statement added, ""These are the consequences of conduct and rhetoric by sanctuary politicians and activists who urge [undocumented immigrants] to resist arrest.

Our law enforcement officers are facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults against them, including vehicle rammings by [undocumented immigrants].

An American Airlines flight was forced to return to Omaha Airport on Monday after the pilots mistakenly believed passengers were trying to break into the cockpit, reports New York Post.The flight had departed for Los Angeles but made an emergency landing less than 40 minutes into the journey. The plane was only about 40 miles into its 1,300-mile trip when the incident occurred.The misunderstanding began when the pilots lost contact with the cabin crew due to a glitch with the intercom system. “After landing, it was determined there was a problem with the inter-phone system and the flight crew was knocking on the cockpit door,” the Federal Aviation Administration said.Hearing banging on the cockpit door and static over the intercom, the pilots feared a hijacking attempt. They swiftly turned the plane around and landed safely at Eppley Airfield in Omaha around 7:45 pm local time. Law enforcement was seen boarding the aircraft shortly after landing.The captain later apologised to passengers over the intercom. “We weren’t sure if something was going on with the airplane, so that’s why we’re coming back here,” he said.“It’s gonna be a little bit. We have to figure out what’s going on,” according to passengers.Omaha Airport confirmed there was no security-related incident. “There was no security-related incident at Eppley Airfield this evening,” the airport said in a statement.The airline incident is not the only one in recent times .

Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire after several days of deadly cross-border clashes, Qatar’s foreign ministry said on Sunday.

Pakistan's field marshal Asim Munir has yet again engaged in anti-India rhetoric issuing veiled nuclear and economic threats while claiming that the ""misconceived"" immunity of India's geographic vastness will be shattered by the reach and lethality of their weapon systems.Speaking at the Pakistan military academy in Abbotabad (where Osama Bin Laden lived and was killed by the US) on Saturday, the rabble-rouser army chief threatened that a response far beyond the expectations of the initiators (India/Afghanistan) can be expected, if a fresh wave of hostilities is triggered.""With diminishing distinction between combat and communication zones, the reach and lethality of our weapon systems will shatter the misconceived immunity of India's geographic vastness,"" he added.He cautioned and advised the India's military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment.

What's happening?

Operation Sindoor and the Muridke connection





A state at war with itself





An imploding picture









“You can’t keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbours.”External affairs minister S Jaishankar issued a stern warning to Pakistan at the United Nations in 2022. Three years later, Pakistan is yet to mend its ways, and the warning rings truer than ever. Then, both leaders accused Pakistan of nurturing terror groups for strategic leverage. Now, the country is confronting the full consequences of that strategy.Pakistan is in turmoil at all fronts, and at the centre of the latest crisis lies Muridke - the same city India struck during Operation Sindoor , a swift 22-minute campaign that targeted terror hubs including Markaz Taiba, the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba.This week, Muridke is again in the spotlight as it turned volatile after Pakistan’s law enforcement cracked down on a protest camp organised by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP). The government action has triggered violent clashes, arrests, and growing instability across the region.In a move dripping with irony, the provincial chief minister chaired what her office called an ""extraordinary"" meeting, ordering arrests of ""extremist leaders"" and seizure of assets linked to the same group once courted by the establishment.Over 2,700 people have been detained, and Section 144 has been imposed across Punjab, banning gatherings and protests.Mosques associated with the TLP have been sealed, its social media accounts suspended, and its top brass is being added to Pakistan’s Fourth Schedule—a list of individuals suspected of terrorism or sectarianism.Officials have also announced plans to recommend a federal ban on the party, freeze its assets, and prosecute its leaders under anti-terror laws. AI tools are being deployed to track wanted individuals.Authorities say the TLP’s so-called ""Gaza solidarity"" march to Islamabad had turned, as one official put it, ""bloody as always.""The timing and geography of the crackdown are significant. Muridke was among the nine key sites targeted during Operation Sindoor in May following the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians.During the four-day campaign, the Indian Air Force destroyed at least six Pakistani fighter jets, two high-value surveillance aircraft, a C-130 transport plane, over ten drones, several cruise missiles, and radar installations.One of its central objectives was Markaz Taiba, Lashkar-e-Taiba’s nerve centre in Muridke — just 25 km from the International Border. The facility, built with donations reportedly including Rs 10 lakh from Osama bin Laden, trained the 26/11 Mumbai attackers.For decades, Pakistan’s national security doctrine rested on militant proxies—to gain ""strategic depth"" against India and influence over Afghanistan. That policy has now imploded.Islamabad is fighting multiple insurgencies at once - from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) in Balochistan, and even rogue Taliban factions across the Durand Line.According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), more than 2,400 security personnel have been killed in 2025 so far—the bloodiest year since 2015. The violence is now driven by what analysts call a ""Quad of Terror"": the TTP, Baloch insurgents, Islamic State–Khorasan (IS-K), and Taliban breakaway groups.Since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul, Pakistan’s western frontier has unravelled. The TTP, long sheltered in Afghanistan, now launches near-daily attacks. The BLA targets Chinese projects in Gwadar and convoys in Balochistan. Despite repeated military operations, the insurgency only appears to be deepening.Drone strikes, air raids, and mass arrests have failed to stem the violence. Meanwhile, reports of enforced disappearances, civilian casualties, and militarisation have eroded public trust, especially in Balochistan.The TLP ban, border tensions with Afghanistan, and the fallout of Operation Sindoor together expose a grim truth that India has warned of several times: Pakistan’s long experiment with extremism has backfired catastrophically.When Hillary Clinton stood beside then-foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, in 2011 and delivered the ""snakes in your backyard"" warning, it was a diplomatic metaphor. Today, it's Pakistan's reality.What began as a policy of control has spiralled into a crisis of survival. Pakistan's greatest threat is no longer at its borders: it's the legacy of its own choices.","Pakistan cracked down on a protest camp organised by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) The government action has triggered violent clashes, arrests, and growing instability across the region.
