They can only be legally dissolved in limited circumstances and, that too, only on the basis of evidence given by both parties.Allowing the appeal filed by a woman against dissolution of her marriage, a bench of Justice Saumitra Dayal Singh and Justice Donadi Ramesh said court can only grant divorce upon mutual consent if that consent remains valid until the final order is passed.""Once appellant claimed to have withdrawn her consent and that fact is on the record, it never became open to the court below to force the appellant to abide by the original consent given by her, that too, almost three years later,"" the HC said.The appeal was filed by a woman against the judgment passed by the additional district judge, Bulandshahr, in 2011, allowing the divorce petition filed by her husband. The couple got married in Feb 2006. At that time, the husband was employed with the Indian Army . According to the petition, the woman deserted her husband in 2007. In 2008, the man filed for divorce.The woman initially agreed but, later, pending the suit, she changed her view and contested the divorce, leading to failed mediation attempts. The husband initially refused to live with her. However, in a mediation before Army authorities, they agreed to live together, and two children were born out of wedlock.Mahesh Sharma, the woman's counsel, told the HC that all these documents and developments were brought before the lower court during the divorce proceedings but, that, the lower court allowed the divorce petition only on the basis of the first written statement filed on behalf of the wife. Based on these observations the HC overturned the lower court order that granted divorce to the couple.","Allahabad HC observed that Hindu marriages are sacred and cannot be dissolved like a contract.

Tragedy averted at 130kmph as train tilts but doesn't tumble,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/tragedy-averted-at-130kmph-as-train-tilts-but-doesnt-tumble/articleshow/113359441.cms,"BHOPAL: A disaster was averted when an express train suddenly lurched and tilted in MPs Morena district as soil under a large stretch of tracks gave way on Saturday morning.Thankfully, there was just enough to stop the train from toppling over. Though there were many skipped heartbeats on the Chhattisgarh Express (Amritsar to Bilaspur), no casualties were reported.The incident happened close to the Chambal riverbank, between Morena's Hetampur railway station and Dholpur in Rajasthan.

The tracks are being repaired and trains are restricted to a max speed of 20 kmph.The collapse is attributed to recent heavy rainfall in the region, which led to soil erosion at two locations on the Morena-Gwalior down track.

Trump and Vance amplify false narrative

About Allexis Ferrell

Legal proceedings and mental health evaluation

Authorities warn against misinformation

A bizarre case involving a woman accused of killing and eating a cat has spiraled into political controversy, fueled by misinformation linking the incident to Haitian immigrants . The false claims, which spread rapidly online, even made their way into the recent presidential debate, with both former President Donald Trump and Ohio Senator JD Vance repeating the baseless narrative.However, local authorities have debunked these rumors, confirming that the accused woman is a US citizen with no ties to any immigrant community.A misleading YouTube video titled ""Haitian Woman Eats Neighbor's Cat in Springfield"" sparked confusion after falsely claiming that the incident took place in Springfield, Ohio. The video purportedly showed police confronting a Haitian woman for consuming a cat. However, this footage, as confirmed by USA Today, is from a police bodycam in Canton during an incident on August 16. The case involves Canton resident Allexis Ferrell , and there is no connection to Springfield or any Haitian immigrants.Reportedly, Allexis Ferrell is a US citizen with no known ties to Haiti or any foreign country.This video led to widespread rumors about Haitian immigrants eating pets in Springfield. However, Springfield City Manager Bryan Heck quickly dispelled these rumors, releasing a statement on Monday. ""There is no evidence supporting the claims of Haitian immigrants harming or eating cats or other pets in Springfield,"" Heck reportedly said.Despite the lack of evidence, Ohio Senator JD Vance referenced these unfounded claims, alleging disruptions caused by Haitian immigrants in Springfield. He further suggested that there were reports of pets being taken and eaten by people “who shouldn’t be in the country.”Former President Donald Trump echoed these baseless claims during a presidential debate earlier this week. “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs. The people that came in. They’re eating the cats... It’s a shame,” Trump stated, further amplifying the false narrative.Contrary to these claims, the case centers on Allexis Ferrell, a Canton resident, who was arrested on August 16 after allegedly killing and eating a cat. Ferrell, who has no ties to Haiti, was born and raised in Ohio, having graduated from Canton McKinley High School in 2015.Ferrell has faced various legal troubles in the past, including charges of theft and child endangerment. Canton police confirmed that she is a U.S. citizen and has been involved in previous arrests dating back to 2011.The August 16 incident took place on the 1100 block of 13th Street SE in Canton, where police responded to multiple reports of animal cruelty at Jackson Sherrick Homes, a public housing complex. Ferrell was arrested and charged with animal cruelty and disorderly conduct, and is currently held in Stark County Jail on a $100,000 bond.Ferrell has pleaded not guilty due to insanity, and her attorney has requested a psychological evaluation to determine her mental state during the alleged crime. A competency hearing is scheduled for October 15 in Stark County, where Judge Frank G. Forchione will preside over the case.The case has become a cautionary tale about the dangers of misinformation, as false reports continue to spread on social media and even influence high-profile political figures. Local authorities have reiterated that there is no evidence of immigrants being involved in the incident, emphasizing that the claims made by Senator Vance and echoed by Trump are unfounded.","Allexis Ferrell, a Canton resident, was arrested on August 16 after allegedly killing and eating a cat.

Who was Azali Assoumani?





A man arrested for attacking Comoros President Azali Assoumani with a knife was found dead in his prison cell under unclear circumstances, authorities said on Saturday.National prosecutor Ali Mohamed Djounaid said that the attacker, identified as 24-year-old soldier Ahmed Abdou , assaulted the president with a kitchen knife during a funeral for a prominent religious leader before being restrained and handed over to investigators.Abdou also attacked a relative of the late religious leader. Assoumani sustained an injury to his hand following the attack.The attacker was placed in an isolated cell to calm him down following his arrest, according to Djounaid.""He (Abdou) was isolated in a cell so that he could calm down yesterday after his arrest. Investigators found his lifeless body lying on the floor this morning.

Swift's endorsement: Beyond the numbers

Global pop star Taylor Swift 's endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris has stirred significant buzz and could influence the upcoming election.

The campaign, which was unaware of Swift's decision until her post, is keen on leveraging this momentum. Harris's aides are reportedly hopeful for further involvement from Swift, possibly in the form of a rally appearance in Pennsylvania, a critical battleground state.Celebrity endorsements have historically had mixed results. A 2008 study highlighted Oprah Winfrey's impact on Barack Obama's vote count, while other endorsements, like those from George Clooney and Angelina Jolie, showed minimal effect. Margaretha Bentley from Arizona State University points out that while some students might be influenced by celebrities, others view their endorsements as unrelated to politics.Swift's endorsement has already shown tangible results. The site Vote.gov experienced a 585% spike in traffic during a critical time window after Swift's post. Her promotion of voter registration and early voting is seen as a potent example of how influential figures can mobilize the public.Swift’s support extends to more than just social media.

New intelligence reports reveal that Hamza bin Laden , the son of Osama bin Laden , has taken command of al-Qaida, contradicting claims that he was killed in a 2019 US airstrike. Hamza, known as the ""Crown Prince of Terror,"" is now believed to be playing a pivotal role in the terror group's resurgence, overseeing the establishment of new training camps in Afghanistan, as al-Qaida rebuilds its capabilities to launch attacks against Western nations, including Britain and the US, a report in UK's Mirror said. Experts warn that Hamza’s leadership is reinvigorating the group and deepening its ties with the Taliban.

, the son of , has taken command of al-Qaida, contradicting claims that he was killed in a 2019 US airstrike. Hamza, known as the ""Crown Prince of Terror,"" is now believed to be playing a pivotal role in the terror group's resurgence, overseeing the establishment of new training camps in Afghanistan, as al-Qaida rebuilds its capabilities to launch attacks against Western nations, including Britain and the US, a report in UK's Mirror said. Experts warn that Hamza’s leadership is reinvigorating the group and deepening its ties with the Taliban. Hamza’s brother, Abdullah bin Laden, is also thought to be involved in al-Qaida’s operations, creating a powerful family-led terror dynasty with a shared mission to spread chaos, much like their father before them.

Hamza bin Laden and his four wives are believed to have sheltered in Iran for several years to evade the CIA. Despite claims of his death in a 2019 US air strike in Afghanistan, no DNA proof was acquired to confirm his demise. The recent intelligence suggests that Hamza uses safe houses in various Afghan provinces to facilitate the movement of al-Qaida members to and from Iran, the Mirror report said.

The reports suggest that Hamza’s survival and resurgence could mark al-Qaida’s most potent revival since the Iraq War, sparking fears of a new wave of terrorist activity aimed at the West, the Mirror report said.

Why it matters

Hamza bin Laden’s leadership represents a renewed threat from al-Qaida, a group that had been largely quiet following the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011 and the killing of Osama’s successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, in a 2022 US drone strike. With Hamza at the helm, al-Qaida has been regrouping in Afghanistan, taking advantage of the Taliban’s return to power after the US withdrawal in 2021.

This resurgence could have dire consequences for the West. Afghanistan is now home to a growing number of terror training camps, where fighters and suicide bombers are being prepared for attacks on Western targets. The Taliban, despite earlier promises to cut ties with terror groups, has allowed al-Qaida to re-establish itself within the country, further complicating the security situation.

According to some reports, there are as many as 21 different terror networks operating in Afghanistan, making it the world's most concentrated terror hotspot.

The fact that these camps are being built in areas where Western forces previously fought—such as Helmand and Ghazni provinces—underscores the symbolic and strategic threat posed by al-Qaida’s resurgence. The presence of these camps, coupled with the growing strength of al-Qaida, has sparked fears that another 9/11-style attack could be in the works. ""The parallels between the current situation and the prelude to the 9/11 attacks are alarming,"" said one intelligence analysis seen by the Mirror.

The big picture

Al-Qaida’s comeback is closely tied to the Taliban’s resurgence in Afghanistan. Since the fall of Kabul in 2021, the Taliban has maintained a strong relationship with al-Qaida, providing the terror group with safe havens and training facilities.

This collaboration is not new; the Taliban and al-Qaida have shared deep historical ties dating back to the 1990s when Osama bin Laden first established al-Qaida’s headquarters in Afghanistan. These ties persisted despite the US-led invasion in 2001, and they are now stronger than ever.

According to a recent report from the United Nations Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, al-Qaida has opened eight new training camps across Afghanistan in 2024. These camps are situated in provinces like Ghazni, Laghman, Parwan, Uruzgan, and Helmand—many of which were once battlegrounds for US and British forces fighting the Taliban. In addition to these camps, al-Qaida has established five madrasas (religious schools) in areas such as Kunar and Nangarhar provinces, which serve as breeding grounds for new recruits.

Hamza bin Laden has reportedly played a key role in this resurgence. Intelligence suggests that Hamza, now in his 30s, has been living in Afghanistan under the protection of senior Taliban leaders, holding regular meetings with them to coordinate al-Qaida’s activities.

Hamza is also believed to have received support from Sirajuddin Haqqani, an Afghan warlord and leader of the infamous Haqqani network. Haqqani, who is linked to multiple terror attacks in Afghanistan, is said to be sheltering Hamza and his family in the country, further strengthening the ties between the Taliban and al-Qaida.

""The resurgence and stronger ties between the Taliban and al-Qaida and the establishment of its training camps in Afghanistan represent a profound threat to the West,"" said one intelligence dossier. Western officials are particularly concerned that the Taliban is facilitating the movement of al-Qaida operatives between Afghanistan and Iran, allowing them to regroup and plan attacks with minimal interference.

What they’re saying

Colonel Richard Kemp, former chief of UK forces in Afghanistan, has voiced strong concerns about Hamza’s role in al-Qaida’s resurgence. ""Hamza now appears to have an open field in Afghanistan and will be intent on conquest and vengeance for his father,"" Kemp told the Mirror. He warns that Hamza’s leadership, combined with the Taliban’s tolerance for terror groups, could lead to a new wave of attacks on the West.

“Hamza bin Laden is not only alive but actively involved in al-Qaida’s resurgence, a fact well-known among senior Taliban leaders. These leaders engage with him, holding regular meetings and securing him and his family,"" reads an intelligence report. Another source said, ""[Hamza] has ascended to the leadership of al-Qaida, steering [it] towards its most potent resurgence since the Iraq War.""

Beyond Western intelligence, Afghan resistance groups have also expressed alarm over the growing presence of al-Qaida in the country, a Foreign Policy report said. Ali Maisam Nazary, a senior leader of Afghanistan’s National Resistance Front (NRF), said during a visit to Washington: “The Taliban have allowed al-Qaida to build bases and munitions depots in the heart of the Panjshir Valley. We’re seeing all the lights blinking red.”

Between the lines

While Hamza’s survival and leadership have reignited fears of another large-scale attack, the situation in Afghanistan is part of a broader pattern of growing extremism in the region. Alongside al-Qaida, other terror groups, such as the Islamic State’s Khorasan branch (ISIS-K), Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, have been expanding their influence in Afghanistan, thanks to the Taliban’s inability or unwillingness to crack down on extremist factions.

The United Nations has also noted an increasing presence of foreign fighters in Afghanistan, with militants from Arab countries, Central Asia, and even Europe flocking to the country to train and join the fight. This influx of fighters, combined with the training camps run by al-Qaida and other groups, makes Afghanistan a global epicenter of jihadist activity.

Moreover, the growing ties between al-Qaida and ISIS-K are particularly concerning. Previously, the two groups were rivals, but new intelligence reports suggest that they are now cooperating, with reports of inter-marriages between members of the two factions. This alliance mirrors past collaborations between key terrorist leaders and signals a new, more unified threat to the West.

What’s next

The resurgence of al-Qaida in Afghanistan poses significant challenges for Western governments. Despite Taliban assurances that they would prevent Afghanistan from becoming a haven for terrorism, the reality on the ground suggests that the opposite is happening. The US and its allies must now reassess their counterterrorism strategies, particularly as al-Qaida rebuilds its infrastructure and strengthens its alliances with other terror groups.

poses significant challenges for Western governments. Despite Taliban assurances that they would prevent Afghanistan from becoming a haven for terrorism, the reality on the ground suggests that the opposite is happening. The US and its allies must now reassess their counterterrorism strategies, particularly as al-Qaida rebuilds its infrastructure and strengthens its alliances with other terror groups. Intelligence experts warn that the growth of these training camps and the re-establishment of al-Qaida’s networks could lead to future attacks, not only in the Middle East but also in Europe and the US. ""Al-Qaida is regrouping and preparing for future attacks on Western targets,"" said one report seen by the Mirror. The report also highlighted the possibility of another 9/11-style attack, driven by the symbolic and strategic weight of Hamza bin Laden’s leadership.

With Hamza at the helm and the Taliban providing cover, the threat posed by al-Qaida is as potent as ever. Western governments, particularly in the US and Britain, must remain vigilant and develop new strategies to counter this growing danger.

The world is now, slowly but surely, realising that all the talk of Taliban 2.0 was just a ploy by the militant group to smoothen its take over of Afghanistan. The Taliban 2.0 is no different than Taliban 1.0. All the restrictions on girls and women are back. Terror groups are again being allowed to set up based and training camps.Pakistan, the main advocate of Taliban 2.0, has seen a resurgence in terror attacksTehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), popularly known as Pakistan Taliban, is having a free run in Afghanistan.Pakistan, the main advocate of Taliban 2.0, has seen a resurgence in terror attacks by TTP from safe havens in Afghanistan. TTP has openly declared its goal of toppling Pakistan's democratically elected government. The group aims to replace the current system with an emirate that adheres to its strict interpretation of Islamic law.TTP's violent campaign has resulted in the deaths of numerous individuals, including members of Pakistan's defense forces, law enforcement agencies, and civilian population.Now, there are reports that even al-Qaida is regrouping and is acquiring capabilities to plan and launch terror attacks on Western nations.(With inputs from agencies)","Hamza bin Laden is believed to have taken command of al-Qaida, contradicting claims that he was killed in a 2019 US airstrike. Hamza is now believed to be playing a pivotal role in the terror group's resurgence, overseeing the establishment of new training camps in Afghanistan. Experts warn that Hamza’s leadership is reinvigorating the group and deepening its ties with the Taliban. The presence of these camps has sparked fears that another 9/11-style attack could be in the works.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113322608,imgsize-815192,width-400,resizemode-4/113322608.jpg"

Throughout history, the map of the world has been in constant flux, with numerous countries vanishing or transforming into new entities.

The poll , conducted over two days after the showdown, shows Harris leading Trump 47% to 42%—a five-point margin that has expanded since late August.The debate, marked by sharp exchanges and personal attacks, saw Harris relentlessly press Trump on his fitness for office and ongoing legal troubles.Polling suggests voters saw her as the clear winner, with 53% believing Harris outperformed Trump, compared to just 24% who backed Trump’s performance. A CNN flash poll painted an even starker picture, with 60% of viewers saying Harris dominated the stage.Pundits were quick to declare Harris the victor, noting how she repeatedly backed Trump into a corner. According to Reuters , Harris ""put Trump on the defensive with a barrage of attacks on his record and legal woes,"" a view echoed by 52% of poll respondents who felt Trump struggled to keep up.For Harris, the poll is a welcome rebound after a recent New York Times/Siena College survey—widely regarded as highly accurate—showed her trailing Trump by a single point. That poll had put Trump at 48% to Harris' 47%, a razor-thin margin that had fueled anxiety within Democratic circles.Despite the positive numbers, the race remains tight, with battleground states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Wisconsin holding the keys to the White House. National polls, while promising, offer only a snapshot of the larger fight for electoral votes.In a bid to capitalize on her debate momentum, Harris' campaign swiftly challenged Trump to a second face-off, with Fox News offering to host the rematch. “Vice President Harris is ready for round two. Is Donald Trump?” her team asked in a pointed post-debate statement.Trump, meanwhile, has wavered on whether he’s game for another debate, calling the push for a second round a sign of desperation from the Harris camp. However, he’s left the door open depending on the host network.As the dust settles, the next major clash will be between the vice presidential nominees—Ohio Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz—who are scheduled to debate on October 1, setting the stage for yet another high-stakes political face-off.","A new Reuters/Ipsos poll shows Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of former President Donald Trump.

Drawing on historical parallels, he likened Trump’s current predicament to that of Senator Joe McCarthy in the early 1950s, who, despite a strong initial presence, quickly fell out of favor, he told political commentator Kristen Soltis Anderson and former Senator Al Franken.""Every time he's been done crazy shit and gotten himself in trouble, I said, no, no, it's not over.

Truth behind man carrying geese which led to Haitians eating pets rumour revealed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/truth-behind-man-carrying-geese-which-led-to-haitians-eating-pets-rumour-revealed/articleshow/113356564.cms,"Woman behind rumor expresses regret

A viral photo of a man carrying two geese which stirred controversy and confusion after being linked to recent claims by former President Donald Trump . The image, which has been widely shared online, was initially used to support rumors that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating pets. However, officials have clarified the real story behind the photograph.According to TMZ, the Ohio Division of Wildlife has confirmed that the man seen in the photo was not involved in any nefarious activities.Instead, he was simply collecting two geese that had been struck by a car in Columbus, Ohio. The location of the incident is significant because it is about 45 minutes away from Springfield, where recent rumors about Haitian immigrants originated.The Franklin County Wildlife Office explained to TMZ that while claiming animal carcasses usually requires documentation, geese are an exception. Therefore, the man was legally allowed to pick up the geese without needing additional paperwork. There is also no evidence to suggest that the man is an immigrant or has any intentions of consuming the geese.The confusion began with a misleading video titled “Haitian Woman Eats Neighbor's Cat in Springfield,” which falsely claimed that a Haitian woman was caught eating a pet. This video, as verified by USA Today, was actually from an unrelated incident in Canton involving Allexis Ferrell, who has no known ties to Haiti. Springfield City Manager Bryan Heck quickly debunked the rumors, stating, “There is no evidence supporting the claims of Haitian immigrants harming or eating cats or other pets in Springfield.”Despite the lack of evidence, Trump and Ohio Senator JD Vance have perpetuated these false claims. During a recent debate, Trump suggested that Haitian immigrants were causing disruptions and eating pets in Springfield. At a rally, Trump further claimed that immigrants were taking geese from local parks and lakes. ""A recording of 911 calls shows residents reporting that the migrants are walking off with the town’s geese. They’re taking the geese. You know where the geese are? In the park, in the lake. And even walking off with their pets,"" the former President said.Erika Lee, whose Facebook post about the supposed pet-eating incidents sparked the controversy, has expressed regret over the situation. Lee’s post, which was based on second-hand information, was not intended to spread misinformation . “I’m not a racist,” Lee told NBC News, emphasizing that her intention was not to fuel racial or xenophobic narratives. Lee, who is mixed race and a member of the LGBTQ community, regretted how her post escalated into a national controversy.The photo of the man with the geese was mistakenly associated with these rumors, but it has now been confirmed that he was simply handling geese involved in an accident.","The Ohio Division of Wildlife has confirmed that the man seen in the photo was not involved in any nefarious activities.

And in 2024, he is the vice presidential candidate of the GOP. On several occasions, he explained how he evolved over the years.

But what we're seeing in Springfield really drives it home,"" Ohio senator JD Vance said. Ohio's Springfield has been on the edge over the bizarre rumor that Haitians immigrants living there have been killing pet cats and dogs to eat them.After Donald Trump spoke about it in his debate speech, several establishments received bomb threat. Another round of threats were issued on Saturday.JD said this threat is also condemnable and has no justification. ""Nothing justifies violence or the threat of violence levied against Springfield or its residents. We condemn both. But the existence of threats doesn't justify silencing those who wish to petition their leadership for a better life. There is no heckler's veto in our country. Donald Trump was shot in the head, and yet they still call him a 'threat to democracy',"" JD Vance said.""Yet it is Kamala Harris who is a threat to democracy. It is Kamala Harris who would rather import new voters than persuade the ones who are already here. It is Kamala Harris who would rather ignore the citizens of Springfield than undo the policies that hurt them. It is Kamala Harris who would rather censor her fellow Americans than listen to them.""The Ohio senator said the administration ignored the problems of Springfield for years.

This was not her first attack on Kamala Harris but this rattled even Republicans like Marjorie Taylor Greene who said Laura Loomer does not represent the party and this makes Donald Trump look bad.But Laura's proximity with Donald Trump set the tongues wagging as Laura joined Trump before the ABC News presidential debate, then she was with Trump at a 9/11 event.Donald Trump reacted to the controversy and said Laura Loomer is a private citizen and she does not work for his campaign.

""...like the many millions of people who support me, she is tired of watching the Radical Left Marxists and Fascists violently attack and smear me...""

What happened to Springfield?

Amid the major controversy over rumors that Haitians are eating cats and dogs in Ohio's Springfield, a new video posted by Christopher F Rufo, claimed that African migrants last year were filmed grilling cats in Dayton. And the claim found its backing from GOP's vice presidential candidate JD Vance who condemned how the story ""debunked"" by media turned out to have merit.""Kamala Harris and her media apparatchiks should be ashamed of themselves,"" Vance said sharing Christopher's post.Christopher Rufo who identifies himself as a person who is leading the fight against the left-wing ideological regime said his investigation revealed that some migrants in Ohio have been ""eating the cats"" though not exactly how former president Donald Trump described in his debate speech.""We identified a social media post, dated August 25, 2023, with a short video depicting what appear to be two skinned cats on top of a blue barbeque,"" he wrote in his blog. He said he spoke to the person who made the video. The person wanted anonymity but confirmed that the ""African dude next door had the damn cat on the grill"".Christopher said they identified their house (the one who hat the cat on the grill) and got to know that they were from Congo. Christopher said new residents now live in the house but the blue grill is still there.""To be clear: this single incident does not confirm every particularity of Trump’s statement. The town is Dayton, not Springfield; cats alone were on the grill, not cats and dogs. But it does break the general narrative peddled by the establishment media and its “fact checkers,” who insisted that this has never happened, and that any suggestion otherwise is somehow an expression of racism,"" Christopher wrote.Ohio's Springfield became the hotbed of a tense situation after several Republicans furthered the conspiracy theory that Haitian immigrants there were killing and eating cats, dogs and ducks. After Trump mentioned this as the presidential debate, several establishments received bomb threats and Springfield has been on the brink this past week.","Christopher F Rufo claims African migrants filmed grilling cats in Dayton, Ohio.

""I'm not a racist. Everybody seems to be turning it into that, and that was not my intent,"" she said adding that her daughter is half- black and she herself is mixed race and a member of the LGBTQ community.What Erika posted was not her first hand knowledge but something that she heard from her neighbor Kimberly Newton.

The photographer said he posted the photo on Reddit because he thought it was something that does not happen daily that a man carries dead ducks in his hand.Now the Ohio Division of Wildfire has confirmed that the man was actually picking up two geese that were hit in a car accident.
