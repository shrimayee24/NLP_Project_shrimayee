She and her brother Manish Vijay, additional commissioner of central excise and customs in Kochi, are suspected to have entered into a suicide pact along with their mother Shakuntala.The matriarch's body was found covered in a white cloth with petals sprinkled all over, leading investigators to presume she died before the siblings purportedly took their lives in separate rooms of Manish's official quarters at Eechamukk in Kochi's Kakkanad neighbourhood.Investigators aren't ruling out the possibility of Shakuntala dying of any natural cause before her son and daughter hanged themselves. ""We will know the details for sure, including the time of death, only after the autopsies,"" said assistant CP (Thrikkakara) P V Baby.Manish's colleagues were the first to find the bodies when they visited the house to check on him as he was supposed to resume work the previous day after a period of leave but was incommunicado.Police found a note in Manish' diary, dated Feb 15, with an instruction to hand over some documents to his younger sister, who is currently in Dubai. The note mentions her phone number. ""She will be arriving soon after the autopsies, which most likely will be done on Saturday,"" a police officer said.Shalini was the topper among 64 civil servants recruited through JPSC's first combined exam in 2003.Some candidates who didn't make the cut challenged the recruitment process soon after, pointing out that many of those who cleared the exam were linked to politicians or officials. As the state probe dragged on, Jharkhand HC had the case transferred to CBI in 2022.CBI filed charges against Shalini and the other recruits under sections 420 (cheating), 423 (fraudulent documentation) and 201 (destruction of evidence) of the IPC, among other offences, along with 13(2) and 13(1)(D) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The next hearing is scheduled for Feb 27.The Vijay family lived in a rented house in Ranchi until 2013. Shalini's mother used to be a college professor in Bokaro.","Shalini Vijay was assistant director in the Jharkhand social welfare department.

'Don't take me lightly': Eknath Shinde's 'warning' amid rumours of Mahayuti rift,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-take-me-lightly-eknath-shindes-warning-amid-rumours-of-mahayuti-rift/articleshow/118455655.cms,"Former chief minister Eknath Shinde

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde has once again sent a strong message to his political opponents and allies alike, warning them not to underestimate him. Reflecting on his political journey and the 2022 rebellion that reshaped the state’s leadership, Shinde asserted that he is not just any party worker but a disciple of Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray and his mentor Anand Dighe.""I have said this earlier too—those who took me lightly… I am a worker, but a worker of Balasaheb and Dighe Saheb, so everyone should treat me in that way,"" Shinde told reporters. ""When they took me lightly, I overturned the government in 2022 and brought the government of people's choice.""Shinde’s rebellion had led to a vertical split in the Shiv Sena, with a majority of MLAs siding with him, ultimately resulting in the collapse of Uddhav Thackeray’s government. His alliance with BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis secured them a dominant position in the state, a feat he proudly referenced. ""Back then, I had said in my first speech in the Assembly that I and Devendra Fadnavis will win more than 200 seats, and we got 232 seats,"" he said. ""So, 'don't take me lightly'—those who need to understand this signal should understand it.""Meanwhile, at the press conference in Nagpur, Eknath Shinde strongly criticised the Shiv Sena-UBT saying that those leaders who have left Balasaheb Thackeray’s thoughts and those pushing good people out of the party were pushed back by the people in the Assembly elections and made to stay at home forever.""However, Shiv Sena is the one that carries forward the thoughts of Balasaheb Thackeray and Dharmaveer Anand Dighe. Therefore, leaders, office bearers and activists of different parties from across the state are joining Shiv Sena,” he added.On the email threat that he received, the Maharashtra Deputy CM said: ""I am a worker of Balasaheb Thackeray and Anand Dighe. Dance bars were closed when Anand Dighe was there. There were many threats at that time too. When I was the Guardian Minister of Gadchiroli, Maoists gave threats, but the Gadchiroli police did the job of curbing the LWE menace. I am not afraid of threats... I am a person who remains strong.”Meanwhile, Mumbai Police arrested two suspects—Mangesh Achyutrao Wayal (35) and Abhay Gajanan Shingane (22)—from Buldhana in connection with the threat email. Investigations are ongoing to determine the motive behind the threat.","Eknath Shinde says he is not just any party worker but a disciple of Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray and his mentor Anand Dighe.

Although Shafiq Ansari has now been proven innocent, he no longer has a house of his own. His home was bulldozed by the administration less than 10 days after the woman filed the complaint in March 2021. ""I had built the house on 4,000sqft of land with my hard-earned savings. Now, there's only rubble. We are staying in my brother's house,"" Ansari (58) told TOI Friday.""We had all the papers. It was alleged that the house was built without permission, but we were not provided a chance to show records or say anything. It was simply torn down. I have a family of seven. They all suffered. I went to jail for three months,"" said Ansari, a former corporator of Sarangpur civic body, around 130km from Bhopal. As per the woman's complaint on March 4, 2021, Ansari called her to his house on Feb 4, 2021, on the pretext of offering help for her son's wedding but raped her.Ansari's house was demolished on March 13, 2021. ""They came at 7am. The administration arrived with bulldozers, and before my family members could understand anything, my house was in ruins. I was absconding at that time. I surrendered the next day,"" Ansari said.The verdict came on Feb 14 this year. First additional sessions ju dge of Rajgarh district, Chitrendra Singh Solanki, noted ""significant inconsistencies"" in the testimonies of the woman and her husband. The court observed that although there is a police station close to her house, which was demolished, she did not report the alleged rape immediately. For 15 days after her son's wedding, she neither informed her husband or any of her sons about the alleged crime, and no reason was given for this delay, the court noted. No human sperm was found on samples of the complainant, the order said, concluding that rape could not be confirmed from clinical and scientific evidence.Ansari plans to move court seeking justice for the demolition of his house.","Shafiq Ansari's home was bulldozed by the administration less than 10 days after the woman filed the complaint in March 2021.

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday went hammer and tongs at the Congress party after US President Donald Trump acknowledged India's 2024 Lok Sabha election was ""influenced"" by the external forces to ""get someone else elected"".Hours after Trump criticised the Biden dispensation's decision to disburse $21 million towards "" voter turnout efforts "" in India, the BJP IT department head Amit Malviya posted multiple clips of PM Modi claiming about the foreign influence during the parliamentary polls.During the poll campaign in the summer elections last year, PM Modi was seen lashing out at the Congress over the ""external influence"".""Nowadays influential people around the world have united to remove Modi but there is the blessing of(women power)(maternal power)... it's yourprotective shield) that Modi keeps working despite facing challenges,"" PM Modi said while addressing a rally in Karnataka's Chikkaballapur in April ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.In another rally at Chhattisgarh's Sarguja, PM Modi said: ""Congresspeople and some influential people in the world lose their cool...if India grows in power, it would spoil the game of some influential people. Today, if India becomes self-reliant...some influential people would lose their jobs.""""Therefore, they want a weak government of Congress and the INDI alliance. The government with issues of infighting, which practices corruption. The history of Congress suggests that can destroy the nation for the greed of power,"" he added.In a television interview PM Modi said: ""The entire world trying to influence India's election, which they shouldn't do. They aren't giving their opinion or comment but influencing it. But they won't be able to influence it.""Further accusing Rahul Gandhi of ""urging foreign powers to intervene in India’s internal affairs"", BJP shared a clip from his visit to London in 2023 and said: ""He has aligned himself with global networks seeking to undermine India’s strategic and geopolitical interests, acting as a tool for foreign agencies.""Earlier, Trump once again questioned the United States' decision to allocate $21 million for voter turnout efforts in India. Speaking at the FII PRIORITY Summit in Miami, he said, ""$21 million for voter turnout, why do we need to spend $21 million for voter turnout in India? I guess they were trying to get somebody else elected.""""We have got to tell the Indian Government. Because when we hear that Russia spent about two thousand dollars in our country, it was a big deal. They took some internet ads for two thousand dollars. This is a total breakthrough,"" he added.Senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad also attacked the Congress party for ""resorting to conspiracies"" and ""maligning India's democracy"".""When people don’t vote for them (Congress), they resort to conspiracies, using foreign money to influence India’s elections. They malign India’s democracy, and we strongly condemn this. This blatant attempt at foreign interference in India’s democratic process is a matter of great shame,"" Prasad said.BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan called Trump's statement a ""smoking gun"" which ""exposes"" the dangerous role of a foreign hand.""President Trump's statement is a smoking gun which shockingly exposes the dangerous role of a foreign hand interfering and influencing the outcome of the Indian elections, but the million dollar question, rather the 21 million dollar question, is which were the Indian hands who were at cahoots with the foreign hands, receiving foreign funds to undermine Indian's democracy and destabilise India's statement..."" said BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan.On Wednesday, Trump also questioned the purpose behind providing $21 million to India for ""voter turnout"" and said that New Delhi is ""one of the highest taxing countries in the world"".This came after Elon Musk-led DOGE’s (Department of Government Efficiency) disclosed that USAID contributed $21 million to EC allegedly for boosting voter turnout.","US President Donald Trump acknowledged India's 2024 Lok Sabha election was ""influenced"" by the external forces to ""get someone else elected"" The BJP IT department head Amit Malviya posted multiple clips of PM Modi claiming about the foreign influence during the parliamentary polls.

Delta Plane Crash Toronto Pilot: Who is Kendal Swanson? Why everyone thinks she was responsible for Delta flight turning upside down in Toronto,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-kendal-swanson-why-everyone-thinks-she-was-responsible-for-delta-flight-turning-upside-down-in-toronto/articleshow/118428652.cms,"The Delta aircraft turned upside down as it crash-landed on the runway.

In a shocking incident, a Delta Airlines flight turned upside down after crashing on the runway at Toronto Pearson International Airport Monday becoming the latest in a series of aviation mishaps. There was no fatality as all 80 people including the crew managed to crawl out of an upside-down plane. 21 of them were taken to hospital with injuries and by Thursday morning all of them were released.As the harrowing incident is under investigation, Delta reportedly announced a payoff of $30,000 to each of the passengers which raised suspicion as to whether the airlines want to silence the passengers. But reports claimed that taking the money will have no strings attached and the passengers can still sue the airlines for the life-threatening crash-landing.Speculations are rife on social media that the airlines has not revealed the identity of the pilots to safeguard their DEI (diversity, equity and inclusivity) hiring policies. Many viral posts indulged in a gender blame game claiming that all pilots were female -- though the gender had no link to the mishap and Delta did not release any details about the pilots -- neither their names nor gender.Kendal Swanson is the only name doing rounds on X. It has been claimed that she was the pilot of the plane but there were other pilots and the captain -- and these claims are not verified.One viral post with a photo of Kendal Swanson claimed that she was not experienced enough for the landing while the runway was covered in snow. The post said she was an instructor pilot for a small propellor aircraft a year ago and she recently received her licence. Others countered the claims and many questioned who the captain of the flight was as it was the captain's fault to give the landing to an inexperienced pilot, if the claims were true at all.According to the screenshot attached to the viral post, the PIC (pilot in command) was James and the FO (First Officer) was Kendal and the flight attendants were Hollie and Rebecca. Social media users asked if James was the captain, then it was not Kendal's fault.

Three years of Ukraine war:

Baltics disconnect from Russia:

Impact on Taiwan:

Vietnam’s jiujitsu on China:

Bolsonaro charged with attempted coup:

Welcome back to another to another edition of My Take 5, your weekly round-up of top international news. It’s been all about Ukraine the past week with the war in that country homing in on the three-year mark. Shockingly for Ukrainians though, the US under Trump seems to be more interested in doing a “deal” with Putin’s Russia. Europe still, largely, stands behind Ukraine, as exemplified by the Baltics disconnecting their electricity grid with Russia. Taiwan is looking at the Ukraine situation warily given its own predicaments with China. Vietnam, however, is outfoxing Beijing in the South China Sea. And Brazil’s former president Bolsonaro is charged with attempted coup. So let’s get to it:As we home in on three years of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the past week has been nothing short of a roller coaster for Ukrainians. First, just before the Munich Security Conference, Ukraine and its European allies were in for a rude shock when newly minted US defence secretary Pete Hegseth said that Washington did not believe that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders was realistic and that Nato membership for Ukraine wasn’t a realistic outcome of negotiations. This was then followed up by US Vice President JD Vance asserting at the Munich conference that the biggest threat to Europe was not from external sources like Russia or China, but from within. Vance alleged that Europe had moved away from its “core values”, was indulging in censorship, failing to halt illegal migrants and cancelling elections. He conveniently forgot that Trump supporters had stormed the US Capitol and tried to overturn the results of the 2020 US elections.As if this body-blow weren’t enough, the US then for the very first time since the start of the full-scale Ukraine war in 2022, held a high-level meeting with Russia in Saudi Arabia. Astonishingly, Ukraine and Europe were left out of the deliberations, raising fears that the Trump administration was trying to do a deal with Moscow over Ukraine without Kyiv’s involvement. And in that meeting, Washington seems to have given Moscow all that it wanted – it broke Russia’s isolation, agreed to restore embassy staffing, explored the possibility of renewing economic relationships, and decided to depute negotiating teams to end the Ukraine war. This is exactly what Russia was waiting for. What did US get in return? Zilch . And yet Trump then went on to ridiculously rant that Zelenskyy was a ‘dictator’ who had taken US money to start a war that couldn’t be won.Firstly, it was Russia that INVADED Ukraine. Not once but twice – in 2014 and then in 2022. Ukraine has lost so much in the course of this war. To even suggest that Ukraine provoked this conflict is a downright insult and blames the victim. Secondly, Trump is just mad that Zelenskyy has rejected the deal that would see US gain control over 50% of Ukraine’s rare earth minerals in lieu of the aid Washington has provided Kyiv. But that deal has been rejected as of now because it does not have security guarantees that Ukraine seeks. Which Ukrainian leader in his right mind would gift away half of his country’s mineral wealth without any security guarantees? Washington has already said no to Ukraine’s Nato membership, won’t be sending troops to Ukraine, doesn’t want to give Kyiv a big weapons package to defend itself, and yet wants Ukraine to give away its mineral riches! If there were guarantees it would be different. But an unsecured minerals deal is positively batty.So the moral of the story is Ukraine and Europe have to take care of their own security. They cannot rely on US anymore. The Trans-Atlantic Alliance is fraying. Russia is at Europe’s door. Ukrainians will fight till the end. But what after? Will Europe have the gumption to stare down Putin by working together and creating a joint European defence force? Such a force will need the battle-hardened Ukrainian army. Together they can form a European shield. It’s now or never.Meanwhile, the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia have disconnected their Soviet-era electricity transmission lines with Russia in a show of energy independence from Moscow. They have now merged with the European power grid. Before the full-scale Ukraine war, the Baltics imported about 10% of their electricity from Russia. Now it is down to zero. The cutting of electricity ties shows the Baltics’ determination to resist Russia in the context of the Ukraine war. As frontline European states, they have been the most vocal supporters of Ukraine and have backed Ukraine's Nato membership. Countries like Lithuania have given Ukraine some of the highest aid support as a percentage of their GDP. But the big question is will the rest of Europe follow the Baltics’ lead. Will they substantially increase their investment in their own defence, even at the cost of sacrificing some luxuries to secure their common future? The clock is ticking.The change of approach of the US to the Ukraine war has raised concerns in Taiwan. If the US could overnight change its stance on defending democracies and the global rules-based order, what guarantee does Taiwan have that Washington actually has its back in a potential invasion by China? In any case, the US has always maintained strategic ambiguity about defending Taiwan. It was, however, believed that it would do right by Taiwan, having sold military platforms to the island nation to boost its defensive capabilities. Add to this close commercial links between US and Taiwan, including in strategic areas such as semiconductors.But when Trump says that he wants to achieve “peace through strength” and then proceeds to seemingly throw Ukraine under the Russian bus, autocratic nations like China take it as a sign that Washington doesn’t have the appetite for a fight. So, if Beijing invades Taiwan, will Washington come to the latter’s rescue or will it push for a “deal” with China like it is doing with Russia? Given Trump’s previous statements on Taiwan, the odds aren’t looking good for the island nation.Having said that, the US this week removed a statement on its state department website which said it did not support Taiwan’s independence. This has been welcomed by the Taiwanese government. This could very well be the influence of China hawks in the Trump administration. There is bipartisan support in the US Congress for tough anti-China policies. However, Trump as the all-imposing American leader can easily overturn his advisers’ counsel if he thinks he can do a deal with China. Hence, Taiwan will be apprehensive of Washington’s moves over the next four years.Vietnam has been developing islands in the South China Sea at a fast clip. And China doesn’t seem to be happy. It has protested Vietnamese activities in the Spratly Islands. Tough luck Beijing. China was the first to develop and militarise the South China Sea islands unilaterally, disregarding protests from neighbours that also have legitimate claims over these features. In fact, China claims almost the entire South China Sea and uses the cartographical innovation of the Nine-Dash Lines to assert these claims. But the latter were dismissed by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in its 2016 ruling in a case brought by the Philippines. Thus, Vietnam is well within its rights to develop the islands it controls in the region. It’s also a lesson for Beijing: This is what happens when you abandon cooperation and take unilateral action to impose your writ. Chinese aggression is the biggest obstacle to a collaborative approach to the South China Sea. It’s about time that China gets a taste of its own medicine.Brazil’s former president Jair Bolsonaro was charged this week for an attempted coup after he lost the elections in 2022. Back then Bolsonaro supporters had tried to prevent the winner, Lula da Silva, from taking office. Now Brazil’s attorney general has filed the charges based on extensive evidence spanning manuscripts, digital files, and exchange of messages that allegedly shows that Bolsonaro had conspired to thwart the will of the people. But Bolsonaro is also known as the ‘Trump of the Tropics’. With Trump back in the White House, the new administration in Washington would certainly have things to say about their Brazilian pal’s legal predicament. Growing Chinese presence in America’s backyard is a big concern for Trump 2.0. Let’s see how American interests play out vis-à-vis Brazil.","The past week has been nothing short of a roller coaster for Ukrainians.

Hampton Dellinger case: Supreme Court delays Trump’s removal of whistleblower protection chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hampton-dellinger-case-supreme-court-delays-trumps-removal-of-whistleblower-protection-chief/articleshow/118467671.cms,"Hampton Dellinger (Picture: X)

The Supreme Court on Friday allowed Hampton Dellinger , the head of the Office of Special Counsel , to stay in his position.The Supreme Court did not outright grant or deny the Trump administration ’s request to remove Dellinger but chose to postpone the decision. This means that they will wait to see what happens in a scheduled hearing on Wednesday, where US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson will discuss whether to extend the order keeping Dellinger in office.Dellinger, therefore, will remain in office at least until Wednesday when the lower-court order temporarily protecting him expires.The court's ruling was closely divided, with five justices in favour and four against. Conservative justices Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito expressed doubts about whether the courts have the power to reinstate someone after the president has fired them.Gorsuch mentioned that when presidentially appointed officials have challenged their removal in the past, they typically sought financial compensation rather than reinstatement.On the other hand, liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson opposed the administration's request.The Justice Department argued that the lower court overstepped its bounds by preventing Dellinger's removal, saying that it interfered with the president's ability to direct the agency during an important transition period.The Office of Special Counsel plays a vital role in safeguarding federal employees from unlawful actions, like retaliation for whistleblowing. Its leader can only be removed for specific reasons, such as incompetence or misconduct.","Hampton Dellinger is the head of the Office of Special Counsel.

Maine Governor: 'See you in court': Maine governor defies Donald Trump over transgender athlete ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/see-you-in-court-maine-governor-defies-donald-trump-over-transgender-athlete-ban/articleshow/118468289.cms,"Janet Mills and Donald Trump

In a moment of open defiance, Maine governor Janet Mills pushed back against US President Donald Trump during a White House meeting on Friday, challenging his executive order banning transgender athletes from women’s sports.Trump, speaking to a bipartisan group of governors, abruptly turned to the issue and asked if Maine was present. “Yeah,” Mills responded. “I’m here.”The president questioned whether she intended to comply with his order. “I’m complying with state and federal laws,” she replied pointedly.Trump insisted that “we are the federal law” and warned that Maine could lose federal funding if it did not follow his directive. “You better comply, you better comply, because, otherwise, you're not getting any federal funding,” he said.Mills didn’t back down. “See you in court,” she shot back.Trump responded, “Good. I’ll see you in court. I look forward to that. That should be a real easy one.” Then, after a pause, he added, “And enjoy your life after governor, because I don’t think you’ll be in elected politics.”The tense exchange came as Trump has moved aggressively to reshape federal policy on gender and sports, with Republican lawmakers largely standing behind him. His administration argues that banning transgender female athletes from women’s sports is about fairness, while critics say it targets an already vulnerable group.Shortly after Mills' challenge, the US department of education notified Maine’s education commissioner, Pender Makin, that it had launched a “directed investigation” into the state’s handling of the issue. The letter cited reports that a school had allowed “at least one male student to compete in girls' categories.”The confrontation left an impression on those in the room. Hawaii governor Josh Green, a Democrat, noted that several governors found the exchange unsettling. “It seemed it was a little bit harsh – and it wasn’t yelling, but it was unnecessary conflict,” he said.Furthermore, the Maine Principals’ Association announced it would continue allowing transgender female athletes to compete in high school sports, following the Maine Human Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination based on gender identity. However, the US department of education’s Office of Civil Rights launched an investigation into the state, claiming it violates federal antidiscrimination laws by allowing ""male athletes"" to compete in girls’ sports. The department warned that Maine must comply with Title IX as interpreted by the Trump administration if it wants to continue receiving federal education funds.Maine governor Janet Mills and attorney general Aaron Frey have vowed to fight back, calling the investigation politically motivated. Mills has stated that the state ""will not be intimidated"" and promised legal action if federal funding is withheld. She argued the issue is not just about sports but about a president forcing compliance without regard for the rule of law. Frey also pledged to defend Maine’s laws against what he described as Trump’s bullying tactics. The executive order Trump signed earlier this month allows federal agencies to enforce compliance with his administration’s interpretation of Title IX, which defines ""sex"" based on birth assignment. Schools and organizations that refuse to comply risk losing federal funding.","Maine governor Janet Mills challenged US President Donald Trump during a White House meeting on Friday.

They have sought the timely attention of state forests minister Ganesh Naik .It is learnt that Naik may discuss the issue with activists and the forest department during his scheduled janata darbar in Thane next week. Activists and alert residents claimed frequent forest fires were reported at various points along the mountain ranges skirting Thane city and Mumbra in recent times.A major fire erupted in some parts of the Mama Bhanja Hills recently, which, locals said, was visible even from far away. This raises questions about safety, considering the presence of sensitive installations like the Air Force station at Yeour, which is located in the belt, and also the possibility of the blaze spreading to nearby urban settlements.Activist and Thane MNS functionary Sandeep Pachange said he wrote to Naik elaborating on the risks involved due to these sudden forest fires sparking in the region, especially in the SGNP.“We fear the involvement of miscreants and have sought the intervention of the minister to take timely corrective action without waiting for a major tragedy. Recently, the mystery forest fires in California caused immense destruction, and we need to stay alert and avert a similar situation in Thane city, which is located in close proximity to the jungle,” he said.Fellow activist Vijay Tripathi said he met minister Naik recently, pointing out encroachments and anti-social activities allegedly being carried out in the environmentally sensitive area. This has led to the destruction of a huge swathe of green cover and damage to thousands of newly planted saplings and trees.“I met minister Naik requesting his attention towards the issue, and he promised some action.

Hunter Schafer issued male passport

US actress Hunter Schafer , known for her role in HBO's hit show ""Euphoria,"" spoke out against the Donald Trump-led administration after her passport gender marker was changed to male.Schafer attributed the change to policies under President Trump, who has implemented a federal policy recognising only two sexes - male and female.In a TikTok video shared Thursday and later reposted Friday, Schafer explained that despite having female identity documents for nearly a decade, her renewed passport was marked male.""I filled everything out just like I normally would. I put female, and when it was picked up today and I opened it up, they had changed the marker to male,"" Schafer said, showing her passport. She mentioned the renewal was necessary after her previous passport was stolen last year.Trump's administration has enforced a strict two-gender policy , halting the issuance of passports with an ""X"" marker for non-binary individuals.The state department’s website states that passports will only be issued with an ""M"" or ""F"" marker corresponding to the individual's biological sex at birth.Schafer suggested that her birth certificate, which still lists her as male, likely led to the change. ""This is the first time this has happened to me since I changed my gender marker... and I do believe it is a direct result of the administration our country is currently operating under,"" she said.Schafer clarified that she shared her story not for sympathy but to highlight the potential impact on other transgender people. ""Trans people are beautiful. We are never going to stop existing. I'm never going to stop being trans. However, it does make life a little harder.

Trump Executive Order: US federal judge halts Donald Trump’s order to cut federal support for DEI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-federal-judge-halts-donald-trumps-order-to-cut-federal-support-for-dei/articleshow/118467418.cms,"US President Donald Trump

A federal judge has halted an executive order from US President Donald Trump that aimed to cut government funding for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes, ruling that it likely violates free speech rights.Judge Adam Abelson in Baltimore issued an injunction on Friday, temporarily blocking the order while a legal challenge continues. The decision is a setback for Trump’s administration, which has sought to end all federal support for DEI initiatives .On his first day back in office, Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to eliminate all ""equity-related"" grants and contracts. He later signed another order requiring federal contractors to certify that they do not promote DEI in their workplace policies.The move sparked immediate legal action from plaintiffs including the city of Baltimore and higher education groups. They argue that Trump's directives are unconstitutional and represent an overreach of presidential authority. The plaintiffs say the orders discourage organisations from supporting DEI and limit free speech.Abelson, a Biden appointee, sided with the plaintiffs. He stated that the executive orders pressure businesses, educational institutions, and public entities into silence on issues of diversity and inclusion.""The harm arises from the issuance of it as a public, vague, threatening executive order,"" Abelson said during a hearing this week.Despite blocking the order, Abelson’s ruling does allow the US attorney general to investigate DEI practices and prepare a report on their implementation.The Trump administration has defended the measures, arguing that they are only targeting DEI programmes that violate federal civil rights laws. Officials claim the government has the right to align federal spending with the president’s priorities.However, critics say the administration's stance is an attempt to dismantle long-standing efforts to promote workplace and educational diversity. The legal battle is expected to continue in the coming months as the lawsuit moves forward.Furthermore, Trump also abruptly removed Air Force General CQ Brown as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The move was part of a broader effort to replace military leaders who support diversity and equity. Brown was the second Black general to hold the position.","A federal judge has halted an executive order from US President Donald Trump that aimed to cut government funding for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes.

'Threat to every American’s freedom': Associated Press sues Donald Trump officials over White House ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/threat-to-every-americans-freedom-associated-press-sues-donald-trump-officials-over-white-house-ban/articleshow/118466631.cms,"AP sues Trump officials over White House ban

Why was AP barred from presidential press briefings?

White House officials respond

Impact on press coverage

The Associated Press has taken legal action against US President Donald Trump 's administration after its reporters were blocked from covering key presidential events, including Oval Office meetings and Air Force One trips.The lawsuit, filed in a US district court in Washington on Friday, names three senior White House officials: Chief of staff Susie Wiles, press secretary Karoline Leavitt, and deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich.AP argues that the ban violates both the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause. The organisation is seeking an emergency hearing and a court order to lift the restrictions.According to AP, the White House is punishing the news agency for refusing to adopt a term preferred by President Trump. The dispute stems from the AP’s continued use of the name “Gulf of Mexico,” despite Trump’s insistence that it should be called the “Gulf of America.”At a recent press conference, Trump criticised the AP, saying, “The Associated Press just refuses to go with what the law is and what has taken place. It’s called the ‘Gulf of America’ now.”The AP, however, maintains its global editorial independence. Given that other countries do not recognise the new name, the organisation has continued using “Gulf of Mexico” in its reports, while also noting Trump’s decree.The legal filing describes the White House’s stance as a direct attempt to control media language. “The White House has ordered its journalists to use certain words in its coverage or else face an indefinite denial of access,” the AP’s lawyers wrote.Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Friday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt acknowledged the lawsuit. “Upon driving over here from the White House, I actually learned that I have been sued by the Associated Press,” she said. “So we’ll see them in court. We feel we are in the right in this position.”Leavitt defended the administration’s actions, stating, “We are going to ensure that truth and accuracy is present at that White House every single day.”The White House says the AP is still accredited like other news outlets and can attend regular press briefings. However, its reporters are banned from Oval Office events and Air Force One trips.AP plays a crucial role in White House press coverage, acting as a key source of information for thousands of news outlets globally. The organisation is part of the "" press pool "" that travels with the president and shares reports with the wider media.“When the AP is denied access, the thousands of global news outlets that republish the AP’s news reports, and the billions of people that rely on its reporting, also are denied access,” its lawyers argued in the complaint.There is no Supreme Court ruling that guarantees news outlets access to White House events, but some appellate court decisions have addressed similar issues.The AP’s lawsuit aims to prevent future government attempts to influence journalistic coverage. “The Constitution does not allow the government to control speech,” its lawyers wrote. “Allowing such government control and retaliation to stand is a threat to every American’s freedom,"" they added.","The Associated Press has taken legal action against US President Donald Trump's administration.

USAID: Judge allows Donald Trump's administration to fire thousands of USAID staffers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-allows-donald-trumps-administration-to-fire-thousands-of-usaid-staffers/articleshow/118465954.cms,"US President Donald Trump

US district judge Carl Nichols on Friday gave the green light for US President Donald Trump ’s administration to remove thousands of USAID staffers from their posts in the US and around the world. The ruling allows most USAID employees to be dismissed, with only a few kept on.Nichols at first declined to extend his temporary block on the move. The judge explained that the alleged injuries in the lawsuit – brought by unions on behalf of USAID workers – arise from the employees’ existing contracts with the agency. This, he argued, means the matter should be resolved under federal employment laws rather than in district court.Under the administration’s plan, USAID workers stationed abroad would have just 30 days to return to the US at government expense. In addition, the plan would result in pulling staff off the job both in the US and abroad. Critics, including unions representing the staff, claim that these measures have led to dangerous and uncertain conditions for those working in high-risk areas.The lawsuit details harrowing accounts of workers being left stranded in volatile regions. One USAID staffer, posting anonymously from an undisclosed African country, said, “Everyone says I need to wait and see what happens” as she faced complications with high blood pressure during a late-stage pregnancy.In another case, a pregnant spouse was left haemorrhaging in a foreign hospital bed. Her husband recounted that a US senator had to intervene to secure a medical evacuation. However, doctors stated that the intervention came too late for her to travel safely back to the US.Concerns have also been raised over the administration’s approach to emergency communications. Initially, Judge Nichols expressed deep worry about staffers left overseas without adequate access to rescue measures amid political violence, such as that in Congo. However, he later noted that he had been reassured by the administration’s promise that these workers would still have access to two-way radios and a phone app featuring a “panic button.” According to Nichols, “the risk posed to USAID employees who are placed on administrative leave while stationed abroad – if there is any – is far more minimal than it initially appeared.”Critics of the Trump administration argue that the proposed cuts are part of a broader plan to shutter USAID altogether. The administration has asserted that the agency’s work is wasteful and misaligned with the president’s agenda, though no evidence has been provided to support this claim. In addition to the mass job cuts, the plan has also involved a funding freeze that affected essential programmes. Lifesaving initiatives, including PEPFAR – the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief – and an Ebola outbreak response in Uganda, are reportedly being hampered by these measures.Furthermore, USAID workers still stationed overseas have described chaotic conditions, with many left to contend with issues such as unpaid electricity bills and mounting hotel expenses after being evacuated from dangerous situations.","US district judge Carl Nichols on Friday gave the green light for US President Donald Trump ’s administration to remove thousands of USAID staffers.

Then what is the truth about Kash Patel's enemies list?

Though all Democrat senators voted against the confirmation of Kash Patel as the new director of the FBI, California senator Adam Schiff has a special 'dishonorable' mention as he issued an elaborate statement claiming that Kash Patel is absolutely unqualified for the job and the Republicans also know that, he said. ""The only qualification Kash Patel has to be FBI director is that when everyone else in the first Trump administration said 'no, I won't do that, that crosses moral, ethical, legal lines', Kash Patel said sign me up,"" Adam Schiff said adding that Patel is a political hack, a sycophant and does not deserve to be in the building.Speculation is rife that Adam Schiff will now be added to the list of Kash Patel's enemies that he appended to his 2023 book, Government Gangsters. Claims that Schiff visited Epstein's island resurfaced after Schiff's strong words against Kash Patel. However, it was earlier debunked that the posts claiming Adam Schiff visited Epstein Island over 70 times were fake, as the court documents released in January 2024 did not have Schiff's name.During the confirmation hearing, Kash Patel was questioned about the enemies list which he denied.After being confirmed to the post, Kash Patel said FBI will hunt down those who seek to harm Americans. ""My mission as Director is clear: let good cops be cops—and rebuild trust in the FBI. Working alongside the dedicated men and women of the Bureau and our partners, we will rebuild an FBI the American people can be proud of.

The reaction of the world's richest man gushing about the Fort Knox gold reserve has gone viral and Elon Musk said he'd love a livestream from Fort Knox as he wondered what 5,000 tons of gold even look like. Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference where Elon Musk flaunted his chainsaw, which was a gift from Argentinian president Javier Milei, symbolic of the work Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is doing, Musk said everyone wants to see that gold.""There's like 5,000 tons of gold in Fort Knox. We all want to see it. This is your gold. It's the public's gold. I don't know if it's there. We just want to see it and make sure someone didn't spray paint some lead or something.

Trump said he would open up the doors to check the gold reserve is intact.The Army post is about 35 miles south of Louisville and is spread over 109,000 acres in three Kentucky counties -- Bullittm Hardin and Mead.Camp Knox was established during World War I and became an artillery training center, according to the Army post’s website. It was made a permanent installation in 1932 and has been known since then as Fort Knox. The first gold arrived at Fort Knox in 1937 with the 1st Cavalry Regiment called on to guard the shipment.The facility was built in 1936, using 16,000 cubic feet of granite, 4,200 cubic yards of concrete, 750 tons of reinforcing steel and 670 tons of structural steel.According to the US Mint, current gold holdings at the US Bullion Depository at Fort Knox are 147.3 million ounces. About half of the Treasury’s stored gold is kept at Fort Knox. The Mint said only very small quantities of gold have been removed to test the purity during scheduled audits. Except for these samples, no gold has been transferred to or from the depository for many years. The gold’s book value is $42.22 per ounce.It is said that no single person knows all the procedures to open the vault.","Elon Musk said he'd love a livestream from Fort Knox as he wondered what 5,000 tons of gold even look like.

US President Donald Trump again raised the issue of $21 million funding for ' voter turnout in India ', calling it a kickback scheme , and said that nobody has any idea of what is going on there.During his address at the Republican Governors Association (RGA) meeting on Thursday (local time), Trump questioned the allocation of funds not only for India but also mentioned $21 million for Bangladesh's political landscape and $19 million for Nepal's biodiversity.""And $21 million for voter turnout in India. Why are we caring about India turnout? We got enough problems. We want our own turnout, don't we? Can you imagine all that money going to India? I wonder what they think when they get it. Now, it's a kickback scheme. You know, it's not like they get it and they spend, they kick it back to the people that send it. I would say in many cases, many of these cases, anytime you have no idea what we're talking about, that means there's a kickback because nobody has any idea what's going on there,"" he said.""$29 million to strengthen the political landscape in Bangladesh. Nobody knows what they mean by political landscape. What does that mean? $20 million for fiscal federalism and $19 million for biodiversity in Nepal, $47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia. What the hell do I care about?"" he said.""We got a lot. We got enough problems and all of this is terminated. We terminated this stuff and we're on the track. And by the way, there were so many others I could have I could read all night long, but so many were so terrible, and were actually disgusting. And I know you're eating your dinner, so I didn't want to do that but we're draining the swamp,"" he continued.Responding to the claims, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said that this money is used to 'sustain deep-state assets who work to defend and deflect such revelations.'BJP leader Amit Malviya responded on X, suggesting the funds were utilised to maintain certain influential entities in India who work to protect such disclosures. ""A day after US President Donald Trump spoke about $21 million being sent to India for voter turnout, he has reiterated the charge. And no, he is not confusing it with the $29 million funneled into Bangladesh. This time, he has also mentioned kickbacks. Essentially, this money is also used to sustain deep-state assets who work to defend and deflect such revelations. We are now witnessing the same pattern unfold in India.""BJP national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari called for an investigation to determine if Rahul Gandhi and Congress party received benefits from these alleged kickbacks.Meanwhile, Congress leader Pawan Khera lashed at the government for stating that the Congress government took money from foreign funding agencies. ""Selectively, they are saying that the Congress government took money from foreign funding agencies. When Smriti Irani was the brand ambassador of USAID and used to protest on the roads, was USAID behind those protests? Social activist Anna Hazare also launched a protest, after which our government lost the elections, and then he went to America and held road shows there. Everyone knows that he used to receive money from the Ford Foundation and RSS was also involved in it,"" Khera said.""PM Modi went to the US uninvited. He was not invited to President Donald Trump's swearing-in ceremony, but he went there anyway. US President Donald Trump said he would impose reciprocal tariffs, but he (PM Modi) was just smiling. You (PM Modi) have come (from the US) after hearing Trump's threat. US President Donald Trump said that he would end BRICS, but he was still smiling. America's Adani, Elon Musk called F-35 fighter jets junk. The same is being imposed on India, and he was just smiling...This happened in the US and they are telling us that we took money from US aid to destabilise them,"" he added.At the FII PRIORITY Summit in Miami, Florida, Trump had said the previous day, ""We have got to tell the Indian Government. Because when we hear that Russia spent about two thousand dollars in our country, it was a big deal. They took some internet ads for two thousand dollars. This is a total breakthrough.""Trump pointed out India's strong economic position and high tariffs on US goods, saying, ""They got a lot of money. They're one of the highest taxing countries in the world in terms of us. We can hardly get in there because their tariffs are so high.""","US President Donald Trump again raised the issue of $21 million funding for'voter turnout in India ', calling it a kickback scheme.

Anthony Ricco, one of the lawyers representing rapper Sean Diddy in the sex-trafficking case, announced that he would not remain associated with the case, under any circumstances. Without clarifying what exactly happened, Ricco issued a mysterious statement. ""Under no circumstances can I continue to effectively serve as counsel for Sean Combs. It is respectfully but regrettably requested that the court grant the relief requested,"" Ricco wrote in his Manhattan federal court filing. Diddy has six defense attorneys and Ricco said he already spoke with lead counsel Marc Agnifilo.""Without violating any aspect of the attorney/client privilege, or otherwise providing any details whatsoever on the grounds supporting the application, the government has been notified of the filing of the motion to withdraw as counsel,"" the filing states. ""The government takes no position on the motion seeking withdrawal of counsel for Sean Combs.""Diddy faces charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation for engagement in prostitution. Arrested in last September, the music mogul will face trial starting from May 5 and in all these months, none of his bail pleas has been accepted -- so serious the charges are. Diddy pleaded not guilty to the charges while hundreds of victims came forward with their stories of abuse at the hands of Diddy and his celebrity friends at freak-off parties.Stakes are high as the legal team of Diddy has this uphill task to prove that Diddy is innocent. The exit of Ricco hints that his legal team is struggling or there are cracks inside the team which are now surfacing as the trial date approaches.Ricco said he would not provide any details in support of his application and that the government prosecutors had already been notified about it and they didn't take a stance. He said his exit won't affect the schedule of the case.While Diddy was arrested during the Biden administration, the Donald Trump administration is now under tremendous pressure to release Epstein files and Diddy list . Epstein, a convicted sex offender was found dead in a cell in New York's Metropolitan Correction Center in August 2019 while awaiting his trial on sex trafficking charges. It was a suicide but conspiracy theories believe otherwise as many powerful figures went to his island.Many feel the Diddy case will also take a similar turn as the list of Hollywood stars who partied with Diddy is long and once these names start coming out in the public, heads will roll.FBI director Kash Patel in November said he will restore the trust in the government by exposing the Epstein list, the Diddy list and ""everything else they're terrified of being exposed"".Attorney General Pam Bondi Thursday said a list of Epstein's clients will be released as President Donald Trump has goven a ""very strong directive"".","Anthony Ricco, one of the lawyers representing rapper Sean Diddy in the sex- trafficking case, announced that he would not remain associated with the case, under any circumstances.

US refuses to call Russia 'aggressor' in G7 document,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-refuses-to-call-russia-aggressor-in-g7-document/articleshow/118464754.cms,"BERLIN: The United States is opposing calling Russia the aggressor in the war with Ukraine in a G7 statement being drafted to mark the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion, four senior officials from countries involved said Thursday. The American objections to the statement come after President Donald Trump earlier this week blamed Ukraine for starting the war, which in fact began with Russia's attack on Ukraine.One official from a G7 country said that current chair Canada had circulated the first draft of the statement to the other six member countries. That version, the official said, used language that retained the pro-Ukraine tone the group of allies adopted after the full-scale invasion of the country in Feb 2022. The US side went through that first draft this week and removed all references that could be interpreted as being pro-Ukraine, the official said. The result, the official added, was a neutral draft statement that made no references to Russia as the aggressor in the conflict, nor to Ukraine as the victim of the invasion.Diplomats are continuing to work on the language in the draft, which currently describes ""a devastating war that began with Russia's invasion of Ukraine"" but does not use the words ""Russian aggression"" or ""aggressors"", which have been in G7 statements since 2022, senior German and European officials said. Another senior official from a G7 nation added that the drafting and negotiating over the text could continue until Monday, when the text is set to be published.Similarly, it is not yet settled whether the G7 leaders who will meet virtually Monday will invite President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to participate, as he did last year, the official said.The American objections follow a bitter exchange of insults between Zelensky and Trump. The US president has vowed to try to end the war rapidly and has authorised envoys to hold talks with Russia without the involvement of Ukraine or European nations.The Americans also wanted to cut passages that described the invasion as a breach of sovereignty, one official said. For now, the current draft includes a statement that says strong security guarantees and Ukraine's integration into the EU ""will be critical to secure a lasting peace that prevents future aggression."" Negotiations are continuing, so the final language is still to be determined. The last time Canada was the G7 chair, during Trump's first term in 2018, the president walked out of a summit meeting in Quebec and withdrew his support for the final joint communique, angry about its language on trade.",The U.S. is opposing calling Russia the aggressor in the war with Ukraine in a G7 statement.

Donald Trump says Zelenskyy should not be at meetings with Russia as 'he has no cards',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-says-zelenskyy-should-not-be-at-meetings-with-russia-as-he-has-no-cards/articleshow/118461831.cms,"Donald Trump said he does not think Zelenskyy should be there in any meeting between US and Russia as he is very difficult for deals.

The war of words between President Donald Trump and Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy intensified in the last few days as Trump claimed Ukraine started the war, Zelenskyy retorted that Trump lives in Russian disinformation and then again Trump struck calling Zelenskky a dictator without elections. In an interview with Fox on Friday morning, Trump did not repeat his earlier claim that Ukraine started the war but said that Russia could have been talked out of invading Ukraine.Trump said both former president Joe Biden and Zelenskyy said the wrong things and thus Ukraine got attacked by somebody that's much bigger and much stronger. “That should never have been a war, and all those dead people shouldn’t be dead, and all those cities shouldn’t be demolished right now,” Trump said. “Russia attacked, but they shouldn’t have let them attack, because they wouldn’t have attacked if you had people that knew what they were doing.""“And I will tell you, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin could have been talked out of that so easy, but they didn’t know how to talk.”“I’ve had very good talks with Putin, and I’ve had not such good talks with Ukraine,” the president told the nation’s governors during remarks at the White House. “They don’t have any cards, but they play it tough.”As Trump is pushing for an immediate resolution to the three-year-long war and Russia is happy about it, US and Russian officials held their first meeting in Saudi Arabia on how to end the war but Ukraine was not included in the meeting. Trump said Zelenskyy has no cards and hence he did not think the Ukraine side was important to be at meetings. ""he makes it very hard to make deals,"" Trump said about Zelenskyy.Treasury secretary Scott Bessent presented a deal to Zelenskyy that sought 50 per cent of the country's rare-earth minerals. Zelensky said he rejected the first deal because he didn’t see enough “security guarantees” offered by the US in exchange for the billions in mineral rights.","Trump said both former president Joe Biden and Zelenskyy said the wrong things and thus Ukraine got attacked by somebody that's much bigger and much stronger.

Steve Bannon Nazi Salute Row: Did Steve Bannon do a 'Nazi salute' to the cheers of CPAC audience?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-steve-bannon-do-a-nazi-salute-to-the-cheers-of-cpac-audience/articleshow/118459805.cms,"Steve Bannon is being criticized for his controversial hand gesture.

Former Trump advisor Steve Bannon ignited a firestorm of debate during his appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) after raising his arm in a gesture that some attendees and online critics labeled a "" Nazi salute ."" The incident, which occurred during a fiery speech railing against the political establishment, has drawn sharp reactions from both supporters and detractors. The clip went viral as Elon Musk was recently embroiled in a similar row though Musk aides said it was a 'heart goes out' gesture.Bannon, known for his provocative rhetoric and unapologetic style, was addressing a packed crowd of conservative activists when he extended his right arm upward in what appeared to be a pointed gesture. Video footage of the moment quickly spread across social media, with critics accusing the far-right figure of deliberately mimicking the infamous salute associated with Adolf Hitler’s regime. ""The only way that they win is we retreat. And we are not going to retreat, we are not going to surrender. We are not going to quit. Fight Fight. Fight,"" he said and extended his right hand.Supporters, however, dismissed the accusations as overblown, arguing that Bannon’s gesture was simply an emphatic wave or a call to action, not a nod to extremist ideology. ""A salute is a very deliberate act to the front. Whatever this is, it is not a Nazi salute. He could have seen someone, he could have started to wave and went back to the mic, he could have been doing many things. Quit playing the Lefts games for them,"" one wrote""Steve Bannon, after calling for Trump to be President for life, did a Nazi salute on stage at CPAC. Nazism has officially taken over the GOP. The few remaining conservatives have a choice: either leave the party and obstruct it—or choose to be complicit,"" one wrote.The controversy comes as no surprise to those familiar with Bannon’s polarizing career. His speech at CPAC focused heavily on dismantling what he called the “globalist elite"".Neither Bannon nor his representatives have directly addressed the gesture.","Bannon was addressing a packed crowd of conservative activists when he extended his right arm upward in what appeared to be a pointed gesture.

Two police personnel and four militants were killed in an attack on a police check post in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province on Friday.The attack came two days after the separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed the killing of seven passengers, who hailed from Pakistan’s Punjab province, on a highway in the restive province.In the latest incident, police said that armed men stormed a police check post in Shaban area, some 35 km from the provincial capital Quetta, early on Friday morning, “killing two policemen and injuring two others”, local police station in-charge Munir Khan said.“The police force retaliated and killed four attackers,” Khan said, adding, “Search and clearance operations continued in the area as some terrorists fled to the nearby mountains.”Pakistan has been struggling to quell separatist attacks in Balochistan, which shares a porous border with Iran and Afghanistan.According to official figures, around 40 attacks against police in Balochistan in 2024 killed at least 25 police officers and injured 61 others. Last month, dozens of fighters of the separatist outfit wrested control of a small town in Khuzdar from paramilitary forces. Pakistani authorities regained the town after hours of effort.The separatists accuse Pakistan’s federal govt and military authorities of exploiting the natural resources of mineral-rich Balochistan for development elsewhere in the country, while neglecting the local population. The province has been the site of an insurgency for the last two decades, with separatists frequently attacking police, security forces, and civilians they see as “outsiders” in the region. The BLA also targets Chinese interests in the restive province.",Two police personnel and four militants were killed in an attack on a police check post in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province on Friday.
