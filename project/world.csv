NEW DELHI: Ladakh-based climate activist and education reformer Sonam Wangchuk and over 170 people, who were on way to the national capital as part of their Delhi Chalo Padyatra demanding sixth schedule status for the UT, were detained by Delhi Police at the Singhu border on Monday night for allegedly ""violating prohibitory orders"".Wangchuk and 173 detainees, who are housed in police stations in Bawana, Narela and Kanjhawala, began an indefinite hunger strike in protest against their detention.Delhi CM Atishi was not allowed to meet Wangchuk when she visited Bawana police station.I am sure the LG called the police officers and ordered them not to let me meet Wangchuk,” CM Atishi said. AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, former deputy CM Manish Sisodia and leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi criticised the detentions. The police action led to a wave of protests.The climate activist started his march from Leh on Sept 1 to advocate for the inclusion of Ladakh in the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution to secure special protection for tribal regions. “I am being detained, along with 150 padyatris, at the Delhi border by a police force of hundreds, some say a thousand. Many elderly men and women in their 80s and a few dozen Army veterans. Our fate is unknown. We were on a most peaceful march to Bapu’s samadhi in the largest democracy in the world, the mother of democracy. Hai Ram!” Wangchuk had posted on Monday.Delhi Police will take a call on releasing Wangchuk and his supporters. They are being requested not to enter Delhi in large numbers as section 163 BNS (formerly section 144) is in place in the city.One of the detainees at Arya Samaj Ashram in Narela, where 23 women and seven men have been lodged, said they are on a peaceful march and yet they are being held like criminals. “I joined this march from Solang Valley. We did not face any problems anywhere as such. We even kept in mind that we should not disturb Haryana during this election time and bypassed it. But look what is happening. This is dictatorship. Our people have been divided. Some have been kept here, while we don’t know where the others are. We won’t eat now. We didn’t come this far to eat,” she said.Dr Jyoti, a doctor who visited the Bawana police station, said, “All of them, including Wangchuk, are not eating anything. They were facing some issues for which I prescribed medicines.”Another detainee, Sajjad Kargili, a political activist, said, “We, including some elected members of Ladakh, were detained around 9.30pm on Monday. This is extremely shameful and undemocratic. It is deeply unfortunate that while people like Ram Rahim are granted parole, the peaceful people of Ladakh are denied entry into Delhi.”Ladakh MP Haji Hanifa Jan said he was only allowed to meet Wangchuk for 5 minutes at 3 am. “There are so many problems in Ladakh after it became a Union territory. There is no cultural identity left and youth is troubled. They have been sitting on a fast for years now. Wangchuk was supporting these issues and leading the padyatra. They completed over 700 km to reach the Delhi border. But the action taken is a way to silence these voices,” he said.While the atmosphere inside the police stations was tense, the situation outside was equally grim. A crowd of supporters gathered, awaiting news of Wangchuk’s release. Among them was a 50-year-old woman from Gurgaon, a former student of Wangchuk who had participated in a ‘Sun and Earth’ festival he organised in Ladakh. “He always made an effort to connect with each student during the programme. We stand by the truth. We tried to meet him, but access has been denied. Wangchuk’s demands are entirely justified. Granting Ladakh the Sixth Schedule will not only benefit the region but the entire nation. The Himalayas are crucial for all of India,” she said.AAP workers rallied outside the Bawana police station, calling the LG “a dictator”. National Alliance of People's Movements also condemned the detentions during a press conference attended by environmentalist Prafulla Samantara, climate expert Soumya Dutta, Suniti SR, and social activist Medha Patkar.

Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged.

The officer claimed there were 15 years of wild parties, suggesting that while not everyone who attended was complicit in trafficking, they witnessed inappropriate behavior. He emphasized that many people knew what went on, especially as things became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Israel's military recently conducted a significant airstrike targeting Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah using U.S.-supplied BLU-109 bombs with JDAM guidance kits. These 2,000-pound bombs, also known as ""bunker busters,"" are designed to penetrate fortified underground structures. The airstrike was captured in a video showing Israeli F-15i jets carrying out the mission, where the bombs were deployed to strike Hezbollah's underground command centre.This operation was part of Israel’s ongoing efforts to neutralise threats posed by Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran.As per reports, the U.S. has provided Israel with bunker buster bombs since 2005, with over 1,000 bombs included in a $6.5 billion military aid package in 2023. These bombs are equipped with delayed fuses, ensuring detonation only after penetrating the targeted bunkers.The strike resulted in the death of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrullah along with both military and civilian casualties, drawing international attention to the precision of Israel's military operations and the destructive capabilities of these advanced weapons.Bunker buster bombs, also known as ground-penetration munitions, are specialised weapons designed to destroy heavily fortified structures or underground bunkers. These bombs, weighing between 2,000 and 4,000 pounds, are loaded with explosives and equipped with delayed fuses to ensure they only detonate after reaching their target. They can penetrate up to 30 metres of earth or six metres of reinforced concrete, maximising structural damage through their impact and internal explosion.The concept of bunker busters originated during World War II, developed by German engineer August Coenders and tested between 1942 and 1943. However, these bombs gained prominence in modern warfare, particularly during the Gulf War, when precision-guided munitions became essential for targeting deeply buried enemy assets.: Developed during the Gulf War, this 5,000-pound bomb uses laser-guided technology for precision targeting.A GPS-guided bomb effective in adverse weather, capable of hitting deeply buried targets.: The largest bunker buster weighing 30,000 pounds, designed to penetrate up to 200 feet of reinforced concrete.Bunker busters bombs are equipped with advanced GPS or laser guidance systems for precise targeting, reducing collateral damage. Their strong casings allow the bombs to drill deep into hardened structures before detonating, making them ideal for targeting command centres, weapons depots, and other strategic locations.While bunker busters bombs are not banned by international law, their use in densely populated areas raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding potential civilian casualties. The Geneva Conventions emphasise avoiding unnecessary harm to civilians, making the deployment of such bombs controversial when used in urban environments.","Israel's military recently conducted a significant airstrike targeting Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah using U.S.-supplied BLU-109 bombs.

Walz highlighted Israel's right to self-defense following Hamas’ deadly October 7 attack but refrained from explicitly endorsing a preemptive strike on Iran. Instead, he focused on the importance of diplomacy, coalition-building, and maintaining stability in the region. ""What is fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" Walz argued, stressing that Vice President Kamala Harris had demonstrated calmness and effective coalition-building in the face of adversity.Vance, representing the Republican camp, took a different approach, praising Trump’s foreign policy during his tenure as one of deterrence and stability. He criticised the current administration for unfreezing billions of dollars in Iranian assets, suggesting these funds had empowered Iran’s military capabilities, ultimately contributing to the conflict. “Donald Trump actually delivered stability in the world. Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration,” Vance said. He accused the Democrats of enabling the very aggression the US now faces.Walz’s criticism also touched on Trump’s decision to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, a key point in the Democrat's foreign policy argument. “Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon because of Donald Trump’s fickle leadership,”This comes as Israel continued its offensive against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and faced retaliatory missile strikes from Iran. Iran launched a massive barrage of at least 180 missiles late Tuesday night, marking another dangerous chapter in the long-standing conflict between the two nations.","Tim Walz and JD Vance offered starkly contrasting views on US foreign policy.

Israel, however, remains determined to strike Hezbollah until displaced residents from the northern border can safely return home.The United States reaffirmed its support for Israel, promising that Iran would face ""severe consequences"" for the missile attack.

Deep intelligence led to strike

Importance of intelligence in military operations

Implications for Israeli intelligence

Israel carried out a major airstrike on Friday evening, reportedly dropping around 100 bombs, resulting in the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who was in New York for a UN speech, reportedly gave the final authorization for the strike. The strike targeted a hidden underground bunker in Dahieh, a southern suburb of Beirut.The bombs used included US-made 2,000-pound bombs, dropped by the Israeli air force, as reported by French newspaper Le Parisien.Nasrallah, known for being extremely cautious about his security, rarely appeared in public. However, Israel managed to gather enough intelligence to know that Nasrallah and other Hezbollah leaders were meeting in what they thought was a secret location. This enabled Israel to order the airstrike.Brig Gen Amichai Levine, commander of the Hatzerim airbase, explained that such operations require precise intelligence and that they needed to ensure the target did not escape before the bombs hit. This meant preventing any early warning of the approaching fighter jets.The success of this operation highlights the depth of Israel’s intelligence infiltration within Hezbollah, a stark contrast to their failure to foresee Hamas’s actions before October 7th last year. Military analyst Matthew Savill from the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) suggested that Israel has likely spent years building up intelligence on Hezbollah, including human sources, to keep the information up to date.","Israel carried out a major airstrike on Friday evening, reportedly dropping around 100 bombs, resulting in the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.

Israeli forces launched airstrikes on Yemen 's Ras Isa Port on Sunday, targeting facilities controlled by the Houthi rebels . The strikes, which were part of a broader response to Houthi missile attacks on Israel, resulted in multiple explosions, including large oil tanks bursting into flames.Eyewitnesses reported the scene at Ras Isa, a major oil terminal in Western Yemen, where thick black smoke and fire billowed from the damaged tanks.The attack comes as part of escalating tensions between Israel and the Iranian-backed Houthi movement, which has ramped up its missile strikes on Israeli territory in recent weeks.Israel’s military confirmed that the strikes targeted both oil facilities and power stations in the port, accusing the Houthi forces of using these sites to transfer Iranian weapons and supplies for military purposes. The strikes were described as a response to recent missile attempts by the Houthis, one of which targeted Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport.According to the Houthi-controlled Al-Masirah TV, the airstrikes resulted in the deaths of four workers, including a port employee and three engineers.

Who will succeed Nasrallah?



In a series of targeted strikes over the course of just over a week, Israel has significantly escalated its actions against Hezbollah, resulting in the deaths of seven top commanders, including its leader, Hassan Nasrallah .This escalation came after Hezbollah joined forces with Hamas in Gaza, following the latter's surprise attack on southern Israel.The loss of these key members, many of whom have been with Hezbollah since its inception in the early 1980s, presents a significant challenge for the organization, which is considered Lebanon's most influential military and political force.Among those killed were Nabil Kaouk, a veteran commander who joined Hezbollah in the 1980s and was seen as a potential successor to Nasrallah.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) conducted a targeted airstrike on the headquarters of Hezbollah, resulting in the death of its leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah.With the death of Nasrallah, who had led Hezbollah for over three decades, the organization faces a significant leadership void. Nasrallah, born into a struggling Shiite family in 1960, pursued theological studies and became involved with the Amal movement before co-founding Hezbollah.The group formally declared its formation in 1985, releasing an ""open letter"" that named the US and the Soviet Union as Islam's main enemies and called for the ""obliteration"" of Israel.A day after the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Israel has killed another high-ranking Hezbollah commander, Nabil Kaouk, in an airstrike.Nabil Kaouk was a veteran of Hezbollah, having joined the organisation in the 1980s.The United States had imposed sanctions on him in 2020 for his involvement in Hezbollah’s military operations in southern Lebanon.Kaouk also served as Hezbollah’s military commander in south Lebanon from 1995 until 2010. He made several media appearances and gave speeches to supporters, including in funerals for killed Hezbollah militants. He had been seen as a potential successor to Nasrallah.Senior Hezbollah commander and head of the elite Radwan forces, Ibrahim Aqil was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Beirut’s southern suburbs.Aqil was planning an assault on Israeli territory, with the goal of penetrating and attacking communities in the Galilee, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.The IDF added that his objectives were similar to those of Hamas during the October 7 attacks.In 2015, the US department of the treasury designated Aqil as a specially designated national due to his actions on behalf of Hezbollah. In 2019, he was further designated a ""specially designated global terrorist"" by the US state department. In the 1980s, Aqil was involved in major attacks, including the 1983 bombings of the US embassy and the US Marine Corps barracks in Beirut, which resulted in numerous casualties.Wehbe was a commander of the Radwan Forces and played a crucial role in developing the group since its formation almost two decades ago. He was killed alongside Akil in an airstrike in Beirut's southern suburbs that struck and leveled a building.Karaki led Hezbollah's southern front, playing a key role in the ongoing conflict. The US described him as a significant figure in the militant group's leadership.Little is known about Karaki, who was killed alongside Nasrallah.Surour was the head of Hezbollah's drone unit, which was used for the first time in this current conflict with Israel.Under his leadership, Hezbollah launched exploding and reconnaissance drones deep into Israel, penetrating its defense systems which had mostly focused on the group's rockets and missiles.Top Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Mohammed Kobeissi died in an Israeli strike on South Beirut. Kobeissi led Hezbollah's missile unit.According to the IDF, Kobeissi planned the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli soldiers at the northern border in 2000, whose bodies were returned in a prisoner swap with Hezbollah four years later.There is no one nearly as in?uential and respected among the group’s remaining brass as Nasrallah. The man widely regarded as his heir is Hashem Safieddine , a cousin of Nasrallah who oversees the group’s political affairs.It is not known if he survived Friday’s attack, and the Hezbollah statement announcing Nasrallah’s death on Friday made no mention of a successor. The group’s Shura Council will have to meet in the coming days or weeks to choose its new leadership","Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's leader for over three decades, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Friday. Seven top commanders, including Nabil Kaouk, Ibrahim Aqil and Ahmad Wehbe, were also killed in the strike. The loss of these key members presents a significant challenge for the organization.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113798660,imgsize-991050,width-400,resizemode-4/113798660.jpg"

Two days after the Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah was killed by Israeli bombs south of Beirut, the armed group has yet to provide information about his funeral — or name his successor. Officials in Lebanon, Israel and the US expect Nasrallah’s replacement to be Hashem Safieddine , one of his cousins.Safieddine is one of Hezbollah’s most prominent figures and has deep religious and family ties to the Shia Muslim movement’s patron Iran .He bears a striking resemblance to his charismatic maternal cousin Nasrallah. He is aged in his late 50s or early 60s. A source close to Hezbollah said the grey bearded, bespectacled Safieddine was the “most likely” candidate for party’s top job.The US and Saudi Arabia put Safieddine, who is a member of Hezbollah’s powerful decision-making Shura Council , on their respective lists of de signated “terrorists” in 2017.While Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem automatically takes over the Hezbollah leadership after Nasrallah’s death, the Shura Council must meet to elect a new secretary-general.Safieddine has strong ties with Iran after undertaking religious studies in the holy city of Qom. His son is married to the daughter of General Qassim Suleimani , the commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards’ foreign operations arm who was killed in a 2020 US strike in Iraq. Safieddine has the title of Sayyed, his black turban marking him, like Nasrallah, as a descendant of the Prophet Muhammed.

JERUSALEM: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed a former rival, Gideon Saar , as a member of his Cabinet on Sunday, expanding his coalition and strengthening his hold on office. Under their agreement, Netanyahu said Saar would serve as a minister without portfolio and serve in the security cabinet, the body that oversees the management of the ongoing war against Israel 's enemies across the Middle East.Saar (57) had hoped to replace defence minister Yoav Gallant, another rival of Netanyahu's. But a deal to become defence minister fell through several weeks ago after fighting intensified with Hezbollah along Israel's northern border, leaving the popular Gallant in office for the time being.Saar has had a strained relationship with the prime minister. He was once a rising star in Netanyahu's Likud party but angrily left it four years ago after accusing the prime minister of turning it into a ""cult of personality"" as he battled corruption charges.Since then, however, Saar has struggled as leader of a small conservative party, enjoying little support with the broader public. While he and Netanyahu have little love for one another, they share a hard-line ideology toward Israel's Arab adversaries.In recent months, Saar has said Israel must fight until Hamas is destroyed. He also has called for tougher action against Hezbollah's sponsor, Iran. And like Netanyahu, he strongly opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state .In a joint statement, they said they had put their differences aside for the good of the nation.Netanyahu's decision appears to have been driven in part by domestic politics.He faces a number of key political battles in the coming weeks -- including the contentious issue of drafting ultra-Orthodox men into the army, passing a budget and taking the stand in his long-running corruption trial. Saar is expected to help Netanyahu on many of these issues.His appointment also will likely scale back the influence of ultranationalist members of his coalition. Bezalel Smotrich, the Israeli finance minister, and Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel's minister of national security, are religious ideologues who have threatened to bring down the government if Netanyahu makes too many concessions in any cease-fire deal. Ben-Gvir has also drawn international criticism for provocative visits to a contested Jerusalem holy site.Sunday's agreement gives Saar, who hopes to be prime minister one day, an opportunity to revive his political career, while expanding Netanyahu's majority coalition to 68 seats in the 120-seat parliament.","Gideon Saar will serve as a minister without portfolio and serve in the security cabinet.

Former Hezbollah leader Nasrallah's body recovered 'intact'



Israel's 'precise' strike



Israel tracked Nasrallah for months

Iran calls for UNSC meeting



Israel vows to keep up attacks on Hezbollah



The Israeli military announced on Sunday that the airstrike responsible for the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut earlier this week also resulted in the elimination of more than 20 additional members of the Lebanese armed group.""More than 20 other terrorists of varying ranks, who were present at the underground headquarters in Beirut located beneath civilian buildings, and were managing Hezbollah's terrorist operations against the state of Israel, were also eliminated,"" the military said, providing a list of some of the individuals.Here are the latest developments from the Israel-Hezbollah conflict:Israel conducted airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen on Sunday, following missile attacks by the Houthi militants on Israel in the past two days. This exchange marks a new development in the ongoing regional conflict.According to a statement from the Israeli military, a large number of aircraft, including fighter jets, targeted power plants and a sea port at the Ras Issa and Hodeidah ports.The statement further claimed that ""Over the past year, the Houthis have been operating under the direction and funding of Iran, and in cooperation with Iraqi militias in order to attack the State of Israel, undermine regional stability, and disrupt global freedom of navigation.""Since the beginning of the Gaza war on October 7, Yemen's Houthi militants have repeatedly launched missiles and drones at Israel, claiming to act in solidarity with Palestinians.The remains of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah have been found at the location of an Israeli air strike on the southern suburbs of Beirut. News agency Reuters reported that his body was recovered intact.The Israeli military on Friday struck multiple bunkers of Hezbollah inside Lebanon, confirming the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, a claim later verified by the Lebanese militant group.While Hezbollah's statement on Saturday confirming Nasrallah's death did not say how exactly he was killed nor when his funeral would be, the sources indicated that Nasrallah's body showed no signs of direct wounds. They suggested that the likely cause of death was blunt trauma resulting from the force of the explosion.A statement released by Hezbollah on Saturday said Nasrallah ""has joined his fellow martyrs."" Hezbollah vowed to ""continue the holy war against the enemy and in support of Palestine.""The attack reportedly involved around 85 ""bunker-buster"" bombs, designed to penetrate deep underground before exploding. Bunker Buster bombs, also known as ground penetration munitions, are heavyweight weapons ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 pounds. These bombs are designed to penetrate deep into the earth or through reinforced concrete structures.The use of Bunker Buster bombs in areas with high population density is prohibited under the Geneva Convention, due to the high risk of civilian casualties.Nasrallah, who had been at the helm of Hezbollah for over three decades, is the most significant target to be eliminated by Israel during the recent escalation of hostilities with the group. The Israeli military said that it executed a precise airstrike on Friday, while Hezbollah's leadership was convening at their headquarters in Dahiyeh, located in the southern part of Beirut.The Lebanese health ministry said six people were killed and 91 injured in the Beirut strikes, which leveled six apartment buildings.Israel had known about Nasrallah's location for months before launching the fatal strike, New York Times quoted three Israeli officials as saying. The decision to strike Nasrallah was made recently, without informing the US. Jerusalem feared that the window of opportunity to eliminate him would close.Hashem Safieddine, a relative of Nasrallah and a potential future leader, was not present at the bunker in Beirut that was targeted, according to three officials.High-ranking officials from the Israeli Air Force reported on Saturday that the operation was carried out flawlessly, without any mistakes or hostile fire directed at their aircraft.""Everything we planned was executed precisely, with no errors, both in intelligence, the planning, with the planes, and the operation itself. Everything went smooth,"" said the commanding officer of the Israeli Air Force's 69th squadron while speaking to journalists.US President Joe Biden referred to the Israeli airstrike that killed Hassan Nasrallah, as a ""measure of justice"" for his decades-long campaign of terror.The president pointed out that the operation against Nasrallah occurred within the wider context of the conflict that was initiated by Hamas' killing of Israelis on October 7, 2023. Biden said, ""Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with Hamas and open what he called a 'northern front' against Israel.""In a letter addressed to the United Nations Security Council, Iran's UN ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani called for an urgent meeting of the council's 15 members to discuss Israel's recent actions in Lebanon and the surrounding region, particularly in light of the killing of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah by Israeli forces.""The Islamic Republic of Iran strongly warns against any attack on its diplomatic premises and representatives in violation of the foundational principle of the inviolability of diplomatic and consular premises and reiterates that it will not tolerate any repeat of such aggression"", the ambassador said.Moreover, Iravani asserted Iran's readiness to take all necessary measures to protect its crucial national and security interests. In his letter, he wrote, ""Iran will not hesitate to exercise its inherent rights under international law to take every measure in defence of its vital national and security interests.""Israel announced on Sunday that it was conducting fresh air strikes against numerous Hezbollah targets within Lebanon, following the assassination of the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, who was backed by Iran.The Israeli military stated that it had ""attacked dozens of terrorist targets in the territory of Lebanon in the last few hours,"" focusing on facilities housing weapons and military infrastructure belonging to Hezbollah.Since Saturday, the Israeli military has claimed to have struck hundreds of Hezbollah targets across Lebanon, with the aim of crippling the organization's military capabilities and infrastructure.Israel’s chief of staff, Lt gen. Herzi Halevi, said that the killing of Nasrallah was ""not the end of our toolbox"".","Israel conducted airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen on Sunday, following missile attacks by the Houthi militants on Israel in the past two days.

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said on Sunday that they have discovered and dismantled a one-kilometre Hamas tunnel as part of their ongoing operations in Gaza . The IDF claimed this effort aims to free hostages and weaken Hamas and is integral to Israel 's broader military campaign, which has escalated into a ""multi-front war"".The tunnel, located in a densely populated area, contained rooms and equipment believed to be used by Hamas for extended operations underground.""As we continue to fight in a multi-front war, we are operating in Gaza in order to bring our hostages home and dismantle Hamas. IDF troops discovered, mapped, and dismantled an underground tunnel route that is approximately 1km long, embedded near residential buildings and civilian spaces in central Gaza,"" the IDF said.The conflict, which erupted on October 7, 2023, after a surprise attack by Hamas gunmen in southern Israel, has since evolved into a broader regional conflict. Cross-border exchanges between Hezbollah forces in Lebanon and Israel have intensified over the past weeks, resulting in some of the deadliest clashes in the region since Lebanon's civil war. Israeli air raids have reportedly killed hundreds in Lebanon, further escalating tensions.Hamas, meanwhile, expressed condolences for its ally Hezbollah following the confirmed death of Hassan Nasrallah, the group's leader. In a statement, Hamas reaffirmed their alliance, stating that ""assassinations will only increase the resistance in Lebanon and Palestine in determination and resolve.""The conflict has had devastating consequences for both sides.
