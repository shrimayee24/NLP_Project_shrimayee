NEW DELHI: At least 15 people were killed and several others were injured after a stampede at New Delhi Railway Station late Saturday night. The incident occurred as a massive crowd gathered after the announcement of a special train, leading to chaos within 15-20 minutes.Among the 15 casualties in the incident, three were children, according to the chief casualty medical officer of LNJP Hospital.The situation unfolded due to a huge rush of passengers who had reached the station to board special trains for the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj. Some passengers fainted amid the sudden surge, sparking rumours of a stampede-like situation and further fuelling panic.Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to X and said he was ""distressed"" by the stampede.

Injured and fainted passengers were promptly taken to nearby hospitals by the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and Delhi Police.The situation has since been brought under control, according to DCP Railway KPS Malhotra, who explained that the crowd surge was triggered by the delay of two trains and an unexpected influx of passengers.Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced a high-level investigation into the incident and confirmed that four special trains were arranged to manage the unprecedented rush, with more on standby. In a tweet, he stated, “4 special trains to evacuate this unprecedented sudden rush at NDLS.

TALIT (BURDWAN): Diversity is intrinsic to India's existence and reflected in its culture of embracing pluralism, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said at an event in Bengal's Burdwan on Sunday.""Indian civilisation is ancient. Every community has its character. Hindus know it and accept that. They know that our pluralist character is a manifestation of unity,"" he said during the rally in Talit, calling for ""sanhati"" (unity) of all Hindus.""We should respect the separate characteristic traits of different communities. Diversity of language and culture has always been part of the Indian ethos. This culture created our identity as Hindus. 'Hindu' is not people from a particular community or religion. Hindus believe in ' vasudhaiva kutumbakam ' (the world is one family). We have always believed in harmony, even with our enemies.""Alluding to Pakistan, the RSS chief said ""those who felt they couldn't remain within this harmonious society made their own country"" while ""those who didn't leave the country accepted the nature of Indian society"".Bhagwat reminded RSS swayamsevaks of "" rajdharma "", citing Ram as the epitome of this ideal. ""India remembers the king who decided to spend 14 years in the wilderness just to keep his father's word. It also remembers the king who put the exiled king's shoes on the throne and ruled the country.""He expressed happiness at RSS expanding its network in Bengal.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis defended the state government’s decision to form a committee to examine legal options against "" love jihad "". He said that while interfaith marriages are not wrong, deceitful conversions through false identities must be addressed.“The Supreme Court has also acknowledged the reality of love jihad in its decision. Even in Maharashtra, we are seeing an increase in such cases. It is not wrong for a person of one religion to marry a person of another religion. But marrying someone by lying and showing false identity is wrong. These incidents are very serious, and action must be taken,” Fadnavis said, as reported by news agency ANI.The Maharashtra government has established a seven-member panel to explore legal provisions on forced conversions . Led by the state’s Director General of Police (DGP), the committee includes senior officials from departments such as law and judiciary, women and child development, minority affairs, social justice, special assistance, and home affairs. The panel will study similar laws in other states and recommend measures to tackle reported cases.BJP leaders, including Union minister Ramdas Athawale, have welcomed the move, calling for stricter laws to prevent religious conversions through coercion. “There should be a law against love jihad. The conversion of women is not right. Two youngsters of different religions coming together is normal, but girls shouldn’t be forcefully converted,” Athawale said.Maharashtra minister Mangal Prabhat Lodha also expressed support, claiming that the number of such cases has risen, particularly in Mumbai. He said that when he raised the issue in the Vidhan Sabha, Samajwadi Party MLA Rais Shaikh opposed it and even filed a court case against him. “Does he want to encourage love jihad?” Lodha questioned. He added that many cases go unreported and thanked Fadnavis for setting up the committee.The government resolution (GR) setting up the committee specifically mentioned 'love jihad' and outlined the panel’s responsibilities, which include examining other states' laws, handling complaints, and developing legal frameworks, TOI had earlier reported. The document noted that the decision was based on requests from public representatives, organisations, and citizens seeking action against forced conversions.Fadnavis had previously indicated plans for such a law when he was deputy chief minister in 2023. He had stated that growing concerns over religious conversions through marriage had prompted demands for legal measures.“Many cases have come up of girls getting married and converting. There is demand from all corners to make a law against this. Earlier, I had made an announcement in the House also. Accordingly, study of laws in various states is on and then the decision about it in Maharashtra will be taken,” he had said at the time.","Devendra Fadnavis: Interfaith marriages are not wrong, deceitful conversions through false identities must be addressed.

We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine. To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians.

We are convinced that Europeans must invest better, more, and together in their security and defense--both for today and for the future.""Following discussions with European leaders about Ukraine's security situation, Zelenskyy conveyed details of his dialogue with French President Macron. He reinforced the need for substantial security assurances for Ukraine , noting that inadequate guarantees would enable Russian deception and potential conflict renewal.Zelenskyy posted on X, ""I just had a long conversation with President of France @EmmanuelMacron following his meeting today with other European leaders to discuss the global situation, the state of affairs in Europe, and security guarantees for Ukraine.""He further stated, ""We share a common vision: security guarantees must be robust and reliable. Any other decision without such guarantees--such as a fragile ceasefire--would only serve as another deception by Russia and a prelude to a new Russian war against Ukraine or other European nations.

But there must be a US backstop because a US security guarantee is the only way to effectively deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again,"" Starmer declared at the Paris emergency summit's end.""We have to recognise the new era we're in, not cling hopelessly to the comforts of the past.

French President Emmanuel Macron has convened an emergency meeting of European leaders to discuss the implications of US President Donald Trump 's actions, according to European officials.The meeting, scheduled for Monday in Paris, was revealed by Polish foreign minister Radosław Sikorski at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday. Two European Union officials confirmed the development to Politico.""I'm very glad that President Macron has called our leaders to Paris,"" Sikorski said, emphasising that the discussions will address Trump’s recent moves ""in a very serious fashion.""Sikorski also compared Trump's approach to foreign policy to a Russian military strategy known as razvedka boyem—or ""reconnaissance through battle""—where a leader pushes boundaries to test reactions before adjusting positions. ""You push and you see what happens, and then you change your position. And we need to respond,"" he added.Trump's impact on Nato and European security has been a recurring concern among EU leaders. While Sikorski has previously acknowledged Trump's calls for European nations to increase their defence spending , he has also been vocal about the broader risks the US president poses to global stability .Macron, however, has maintained a cordial relationship with Trump. Following Trump's re-election in November, the French leader expressed a willingness to collaborate with him again. ""Ready to work together as we did for four years. With your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity,"" Macron posted on X.Trump's December visit to Paris for the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral further underscored Macron’s diplomatic approach.

The Trump administration has begun dismissing hundreds of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) employees, disrupting air travel during a busy weekend. This move comes just weeks after the fatal mid-air collision at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.The notifications continued into the night, and more staff could be anticipated to get fired over the long weekend or even prevented from entering FAA buildings from Tuesday.These firings were focused on probationary staff, with employees receiving emails late on Friday informing them of their dismissal, said David Spero, president of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union.The affected workers include those working with FAA radar, landing, and navigational aid maintenance as per AP.Spero stated that the lay off happened “without cause nor based on performance or conduct.” The termination mails were sent from an 'exec order' Microsoft email address rather than a government address.These layoffs come as the FAA struggles with a staffing shortage, specifically among air traffic controllers . Federal officials have been raising concerns about the strained and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially following a series of close calls between aircraft at US airports.These staffing issues have been attributed to factors like low pay, long working hours, intense training and mandatory retirements. The news of the firings was first reported by CNN.During the tragic crash on January 29 between a US Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines passenger jet, both commercial airline and helicopter traffic were managed by a single controller at the busy airport.The Elon Musk-led department of government efficiency, which is overseeing the administration’s efforts to reduce the size of the federal government, did not immediately comment on the matter.","FAA employees received emails late on Friday informing them of their dismissal.

This was an extremely vile act. The electricity in my cell was shut off for five days, leaving me in complete darkness. I was confined to the cell for ten days. For several weeks, any visits by family members, doctors, or lawyers were blocked. They want to break me through this torture and hardship, but I will stand firm for the genuine freedom of the Pakistnation.""Under the constitutional amendment, the term for the chief justice of Pakistan has been set at three years.

ISLAMABAD: At least 10 people were killed and six injured a bomb planted by the road exploded as a pickup truck carrying coal mine workers went by in Harnai district of southwestern Balochistan province on Friday, officials said.Hazrat Wali Kakar, Harnai’s top civilian official, said the bomb was an improvised explosive device (IED). “Ten mining workers were killed in the attack,” Kakar said.Saleem Tareen, another local official, said most of the victims were from the country’s northwestern Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province. “The labourers were traveling to a market in Harnai,” he added. Harnai lies some 160 km east of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province.Authorities said they were investigating the attack, with officials saying evidence was being collected and that preliminary investigation showed the explosive material had been planted on the roadside.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack yet. But the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant organisation fighting for independence, is active in the restive province that borders Afghanistan and Iran. The group usually targets security forces as well as Pakistanis from other provinces. Local media reported that most of the workers killed or injured came from KP’s Puran village.The BLA has also targeted Chinese projects in the region, arguing that foreigners are exploiting resource-rich Balochistan while the impoverished residents are left behind.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif responded to the incident by reaffirming his commitment to aggressively working to eradicate terrorism in the country.",A bomb planted by the road exploded as a pickup truck carrying coal mine workers went by.

Such steps accentuate military imbalances in the region and undermine strategic stability. They remain unhelpful in achieving durable peace in South Asia,” Khan said.“We urge our international partners to take a holistic and objective view of issues of peace and security in South Asia and refrain from endorsing positions that are one-sided and divorced from ground realities,” he said.","The joint India-US statement called on Islamabad to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attack and the Pathankot attack. “We consider the Pakistan-specific reference in the Indo-US joint statement on February 13, 2025 as one-sided, misleading and contrary to diplomatic norms,” foreign office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118257401,imgsize-34754,width-400,resizemode-4/118257401.jpg"

The ministry said its embassy in Tripoli had “dispatched a team” to a local hospital at the site near Marsa Dela port for the identification.Late Tuesday, the ministry disclosed that of the 63 Pakistanis on the boat, the bodies of 16 had been fished out and 37 rescued, while 10 were still missing. “Three of the survivors are in Tripoli, being looked after by the (Pakistani) embassy,” the ministry said in a statement.The tragedy unfolded less than a month after 50 Pakistanis died when a boat with 86 migrants to Europe capsized off Morocco on January 16. Before that, at least 300 Pakistanis had drowned in a migrant boat that sank off Greece in June 2023, with Italy their intended destination.In a travel alert, Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has identified Libya as one of 15 transit countries used for human trafficking.Each year, thousands of Pakistanis pay traffickers large sums for risky and illegal journeys to Europe, hoping to find work and send money back to their families. Many also take these perilous routes to escape conflicts and religious persecution.Pakistani authorities claim human smugglers send migrants seeking illegal entry into Europe to Libya, located around 300km from Italy. From there, they either take them by boat to Europe or relocate them to the coastal cities of Morocco and Mauritania in west Africa.On Monday, UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said it was “deeply alarmed” by the dozens of migrants’ bodies found in mass graves in southeastern Libya.

An estimated 65 people were on the boat, it said.Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his deep grief and sorrow for those lost in the capsizing in Marsa Dela port in the western city of Zawiya.Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to complete the process of identifying the victims and provide assistance to those affected. He also ordered action against those involved ""in heinous acts like human trafficking,"" according to a statement.Most of the victims came from Kurram, a district in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan , where hundreds of people have been killed in recent years in sectarian clashes.""People try to travel to Europe through illegal means because of unemployment"" at home, said Javed Hussain, a nephew of Shehzad Hussain, one of the victims. He said mourners were gathering at the homes of those who perished in the latest tragedy.In January, authorities said dozens of Pakistanis died when a boat capsized off West Africa. Some of the survivors later accused smugglers of killing 43 migrants in a dispute over payment. Pakistan has since confirmed the deaths of 13 of its nationals.Hundreds of Pakistanis die every year while trying to reach Europe by land and sea with the help of human smugglers. They also use dangerous land and sea routes to reach Europe in an effort to find jobs.Libya, which has borders with six nations and a long shore on the Mediterranean, was plunged into chaos following a Nato-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Since then, the oil-rich country has emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East for Europe.At least 674 migrants were reported dead and more than 1,000 missing off Libya in 2024, according to the International Organization for Migration's missing migrants project. More than 21,700 migrants were intercepted and returned to the chaos-stricken country.In 2023, the IOM reported 962 migrants dead and 1,563 missing off Libya. Around 17,200 migrants were intercepted and returned to Libya that year, it said.Those who are returned are held in government-run detention centers rife with abuses, including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture - practices that amount to crimes against humanity, according to UN-commissioned investigators. The abuse often accompanies attempts to extort money from the families of the imprisoned migrants before releasing them or allowing them to leave Libya on traffickers' boats to Europe.","At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank off Libya.

ISLAMABAD: Hundreds of lawyers on Monday staged protests in Pakistan's national capital against a high-level meeting of a constitutional body with the agenda to appoint at least eight judges of the supreme court. The judicial commission of Pakistan (JCP) meeting was being held despite opposition by four apex court judges, the legal fraternity, resistance by opposition the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and controversy over the recent transfer of judges to the Islamabad high court (IHC), which was opposed by five IHC judges.The JCP, a top body empowered to approve judicial appointments, will finalise appointments for eight vacant supreme court judges.Lawyers gathered at various locations in Islamabad, with the lawyers' action committee staging a protest near D-Chowk. But police responded by closing several key entry points to the Red Zone, which houses key buildings, including the supreme court.Dozens of protestors gathered at Serena Chowk as they were stopped from going to the supreme court due to the closure of the Red Zone. They chanted ""Azaadi"" (freedom) and ""Lawyers' unity zindabad"" (long live lawyers' unity). They were also holding a banner written in Urdu and reading "" 26th constitutional amendment unacceptable"".Clashes were also reported between lawyers and police when they tried to enter the Red Zone. However, there was no report of any arrest or injury during the protest.The protest led to the suspension of metro bus services on multiple routes between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, causing significant inconvenience for commuters. The closure of the Red Zone has caused traffic disruptions, leading to heavy congestion on different roads in the capital.Earlier, the legal fraternity in the country was already expressing concerns against the new appointments and transfers following the controversial 26th constitutional amendment passed last year.The lawyers' representatives had held a convention at the Islamabad district courts, opposing the 26th amendment and demanding the cancellation of the JCP meeting.They also announced on February 3 to protest against the transfer of three high court judges to the IHC but it could not elicit a widespread response. The Karachi bar association had supported the strike call by staying away.Last month, the Lahore high court bar association (LHCBA) moved an application before the apex court through advocate Muhammad Waqar Rana, seeking postponement of the JCP meeting.The JCP earlier this month asked all high courts to send a list of five senior judges from each for consideration for the appointment of eight of them to the supreme court.Initially, the IHC had forwarded the names of three judges - chief justice Aamer Farooq, justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb - to the JCP because justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Babar Sattar did not meet the minimum requirement of five years of service.However, as justice Sarfraz Dogar was made the IHC senior puisne judge following his transfer there from the Lahore high court, his name has also been sent to the JCP.Days before justice Dogar's name was added, five judges of the IHC approached chief justice Yahya Afridi and IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq to reclaim their seniority.Separately, four SC judges, senior puisne judge justice Mansoor Ali Shah, justice Munib Akhtar, justice Ayesha Malik and justice Athar Minallah, in a letter to the chief justice showed concerns last week and are also seeking the postponement of today's JCP session until a decision is made on the petitions against the 26th Amendment.The opposition PTI party in a letter to the chief justice on Sunday asked to postpone the commission's meeting.The 13-member JCP is led by the chief justice and includes four judges of the apex court, as well as parliamentarians from both the treasury and opposition and others.The lawyers and opposition allege that the government was trying to 'pack' the top judiciary with hand-picked judges to influence the fate of political cases, a concern rejected by the government.","Hundreds of lawyers stage protests in Islamabad against high-level meeting of constitutional body. The judicial commission of Pakistan (JCP) meeting was being held despite opposition by four apex court judges, the legal fraternity and resistance by opposition the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. The JCP, a top body, will finalise appointments for eight vacant supreme court judges.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118118417,imgsize-838133,width-400,resizemode-4/118118417.jpg"

Pakistan: Terrorists kill 3 cops in Pakistan's volatile Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/terrorists-kill-3-cops-in-pakistans-volatile-khyber-pakhtunkhwa/articleshow/117993406.cms,"ISLAMABAD: At least three cops were killed and six injured Thursday after nearly a dozen militants stormed a police check post at Karak district in Pakistan’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, officials said.Although no group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, suspicion is likely to fall on Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has frequently targeted police and security personnel in the province.“The terrorists opened fire from all sides at the check post in Karak’s Bahadur Khel area, targeting police personnel using light and heavy weapons in an attempt to capture it. Policemen at the checkpost offered stiff resistance in an encounter which lasted two hours, following which the terrorists fled,” the provincial police said in a statement.Pakistan has experienced an escalation in militancy in KP, adjacent to Afghanistan, following the collapse of a tenuous truce between TTP and the state in Nov 2022.Pakistani authorities have linked the surge in militant violence to cross-border incursions from Afghanistan, alleging that the Kabul administration is facilitating TTP fighters, a claim Afghan authorities refute. Most of these assaults have been directed at security and law-enforcement personnel, although civilians and govt officials have also been impacted.In KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district last week, four soldiers were killed by gunfire and an improvised explosive device (IED) unleashed by terrorists.In Balochistan, another restive province in Pakistan’s south, 18 soldiers were killed in an attack by terrorists earlier this month.Islamabad think-tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) has described 2024 as the most lethal year for security forces in a decade, with a minimum of 685 military and police fatalities resulting from 444 terror attacks.Alongside such attacks, militants have stepped up targeted killings and kidnappings of officials in KP and Balochistan.","Nearly a dozen militants stormed a police check post at Karak district in Pakistan’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack.
