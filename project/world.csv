Indian authorities did not confirm the detention but said they were working to verify reports that identified the man as Majoti Sahil Mohammed, apparently a resident of Morbi in Gujarat.Government sources said that the Indian mission in Kyiv had not received any formal communication on this issue from Ukraine.According to one of the reports from Kyiv, Mohammed had gone to Russia to study but was forced to join the Russian armed forces after a drug conviction. It quoted him as saying he did not want to fight and had surrendered before Ukrainian forces.Confirming last month that there were 27 Indian nationals still serving in the Russian army , the Indian foreign ministry had urged Indian nationals to stay away from the offers being made to serve in the Russian army as they were fraught with danger and risk to life.Majoti appeared on a video recorded by Ukraine's 63rd Mechanised Brigade, saying that he was sentenced to seven years in a Russian prison on drug-related charges.

He was also reported to have said he wanted to live in Ukraine or return to India.""According to Mohamed, he had been promised that a year of service would earn him freedom and payment ranging from RUB 100,000 to 1.5 million (about $1,200-18,000), but he never received any money,"" said a report by Ukrainska Pravda.",Ukrainian media reports 22-year-old Indian national fighting for Russian army captured.

Kumar took PSO's pistol, saying he had 'some work to do'

CHANDIGARH: Haryana ADGP Y Puran Kumar (52), known as an outspoken IPS officer who flagged irregularities, including alleged caste bias, in his own department, was found dead from a gunshot to the head at his Chandigarh residence Tuesday afternoon.The incident happened a day before he was to take up his new assignment as head of Police Training Centre, Sunaria.Police said Kumar, a 2001-batch IPS officer, shot himself with his gunman's service revolver in the soundproofed basement of his brother-in-law's house in Sector 11. According to a police release, a will and nine-page ""final note"" left by the ADG were recovered along with the weapon. Sources said the note named a few serving and retired IPS officers but didn't divulge its content.His wife, IAS officer Amneet P Kumar - civil aviation secretary and commissioner & secretary, women and child development dept in Haryana govt - was in Japan as part of a delegation.A native of Andhra, Haryana ADGP Y Puran Kumar belonged to the Scheduled Caste community. He held a BE-computer science degree and was an IIM-Ahmedabad alumnus. He repeatedly challenged his own department, not hesitating to move court, and had once complained against former Haryana DGP Manoj Yadava, accusing him of discrimination.He was last posted as IG-Rohtak Range before being transferred to the training centre on Sept 29. He went on leave and was due to join his new posting on Wednesday.Investigators are struggling to establish a timeline since the basement, which Kumar had converted into his office, was soundproof. So far, they have learnt that Kumar had asked his gunman to give him his service pistol around 1 pm Tuesday, saying he had ""some work to do"", and proceeded to the basement. No one heard the gunshot - not his daughter, the securitymen, house staff, passersby, nor some labourers working at a plot nearby.About an hour later, when Kumar's daughter went to the basement, she found him lying on the sofa, bleeding from the head. She alerted the security personnel and informed the cops. IG Pushpendra Singh, SSP Kaur and SP-city Priyanka rushed to the spot with the first responders. The house was sealed off, and forensic experts collected evidence. The on-site investigation was videographed, police said.Kumar and his wife have two daughters; the elder one studies abroad.","Haryana ADGP Y Puran Kumar (52) was found dead from a gunshot to the head at his Chandigarh residence Tuesday afternoon.

'Every Time There's An Election...': TMC MP Mahua Moitra Exposes BJP's 'Hindu-Muslim Danga' Strategy

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to examine a plea to lodge an FIR against hate speech for a video being circulated by Assam BJP in support of its claim that Muslims would take over the state if BJP goes out of office.The application has been filed by former Patna high court judge Anjana Prakash and journalist Qurban Ali who alleged that the video ""targets, vilifies and demonises Muslims"".Appearing for petitioners before a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta, advocate Nizam Pasha, submitted that though the offensive video uploaded on 'X' targeted one community in violation of apex court's order, no action has been taken.He also pleaded the court to pass directions for the video to be taken off social media and direct lodging of an FIR.The bench, after a brief hearing, issued notice and posted the case for further hearing to October 28.""The video has been circulated by the BJP Assam Unit on Sept 15 on its official X handle viz. ""BJP Assam Pradesh"" showing a grossly false narrative that depicts the takeover of Assam by Muslims if the BJP doesn't remain in power in Assam.The video depicts the consequences of a change in the present ruling dispensation and inter alia shows visibly Muslim people (wearing skull caps and burqas) taking over tea estates, Guhawati airport, Guhawati Accolad, Assam Ranghar, Guhawati Stadium, Guhawati Town,"" the petition said.They pleaded that the video should be be taken down immediately to contain any further spread of communal disharmony, unrest and enmity.""It is submitted that the aforementioned video shows the gross failure as well as the complete disregard of secular values that the ruling dispensation of any State of our country is bound to uphold. It is further submitted that a state government, elected and formed under the Constitution of India, is the guardian of all communities and is specifically prohibited by the Constitution from engaging in discrimination inter alia on the basis of religion, race, caste, gender, language.

What is Moscow format

NEW DELHI: India, along with other nations, on Tuesday, opposed the deployment of foreign military infrastructure on Afghan soil, effectively rejecting United States president Donald Trump's calls for handing over the Bagram airbase.The joint opposition came at the 7th Moscow Format Consultations on Afghanistan, which included India, Afghanistan, Russia and China, Iran and Central Asian countries, including Pakistan.The countries described the presence of a foreign military in Afghanistan as ""unacceptable"" during the extensive deliberation on bringing prosperity and development to Afghanistan.“They called unacceptable the attempts by countries to deploy their military infrastructure in Afghanistan and neighbouring states, since this does not serve the interests of regional peace and stability,” said a joint statement published by the Russian foreign ministry.The Indian delegation, led by Ambassador Vinay Kumar, reaffirmed India’s support for an independent, peaceful, and stable Afghanistan, along with the socioeconomic development and prosperity of its people, according to the Indian Embassy in Moscow.US president Donald Trump issued a warning to Afghanistan last month, demanding the return of Bagram Air Base to Washington or face consequences.“If Afghanistan doesn’t give Bagram Airbase back to those that built it, the United States of America, bad things are going to happen,” the president wrote on his Truth Social platform.The ultimatum follows remarks made earlier in the week during Trump’s state visit to the United Kingdom, where he revealed Washington was “trying to get it back.” Standing beside British prime minister Keir Starmer, he said, “We’re trying to get it back because they need things from us.”The issue underscores the base’s strategic significance. Its location gives access to volatile parts of Central and South Asia, while also offering a vantage point close to China’s sensitive Xinjiang region, where Beijing maintains nuclear missile sites.Trump also complained that the United States had “gave it to them for nothing,” adding that Bagram is “exactly one hour away from where China makes its nuclear missiles.”Bagram Air Base, located in Afghanistan’s Parwan province, was a key strategic hub for the United States since the 2001 invasion. However, following the US withdrawal in 2021 and the Taliban ’s rapid re-invasion, the United States lost control of Bagram.Also read: What is the ‘insurrection act’? Trump’s new favourite term - All you need to know about At the talks in Moscow, participating nations agreed on the need to strengthen counter-terrorism cooperation at both bilateral and multilateral levels.They stressed that Afghanistan must be supported in taking comprehensive steps to eliminate terrorism and prevent its soil from being used to threaten neighbouring countries or others.The countries noted that terrorism remains a serious threat to Afghanistan, the region, and the wider world.They also highlighted the importance of expanding Afghanistan’s economic ties and supported its active integration into regional connectivity networks.The Moscow Format Consultations on Afghanistan is a regional diplomatic platform established in 2017 to facilitate dialogue among Afghanistan's neighbouring countries and other stakeholders.

The US Space Force has awarded SpaceX , led by Elon Musk , five of seven critical military launch missions for the upcoming fiscal year, totaling $714 million. The contracts are said to reinforce SpaceX’s dominance in Pentagon space contracts, despite recent public tensions between Musk and President Donald Trump. United Launch Alliance (ULA) secured the remaining two missions for $428 million.The contracts fall under the National Security Space Launch Program (NSSL), which previously selected SpaceX, ULA, and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin for 54 missions worth $13.5 billion, scheduled between 2027 and 2032. “Space is the ultimate high ground, critical for our national security,” said Col Eric Zarybnisky of the U.S. Space Systems Command, per Air & Space Forces.“Delivering assets to the warfighter is our ultimate mission, and we rely on strong government-industry partnerships to achieve that goal.” SpaceX’s missions include launching a communication satellite, three classified payloads, and a reconnaissance satellite, with launches expected in 2027 due to the Space Force’s two-year advance planning. Meanwhile, Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket, a competitor to SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, remains uncertified for NSSL missions and was not assigned any launches for this cycle.Blue Origin’s next chance for a mission is in fiscal year 2027, though its upcoming NASA Mars mission—delayed from 2024 and potentially launching by month’s end—could advance its certification prospects.The awards is reported to highlight SpaceX’s lead in national security space launches, while Blue Origin continues to push for a stronger foothold in the competitive space race.","The US Space Force has awarded SpaceX five of seven critical military launch missions for the upcoming fiscal year, totaling $714 million.

Tole first used pepper spray, then pulled out a knife and stabbed Sanchez in the torso. In return, Sanchez allegedly struck Tole, leaving him with a severe cut across his face.Photos obtained by FOX59 showed Tole in the hospital, his left cheek split open almost to his ear. His family said the cut went through his cheek and tongue, leaving him unable to speak clearly.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes pick six leaves Heidi Gardner in disbelief during live ManningCast with Peyton Manning and Eli Manning On Monday, Tole filed a civil lawsuit against Sanchez and Fox Sports, asking for damages for what he called “permanent disfigurement.”Mark Sanchez was first booked on misdemeanor battery, public intoxication, and unlawful entry, but now faces the much heavier felony battery charge. The case remains under investigation as both Sanchez and Tole recover from their injuries.","Mark Sanchez, the former New York Jets quarterback, is in serious legal trouble after a violent fight in Indianapolis.

Long before he said he would stop the Ukraine war within a day of becoming president, Trump said he would get Dr Shakil Afridi out of prison in two minutes: ""I would tell them, 'let him out,' and I'm sure they would let him out. ""But nine years and some months after Trump's boast, Afridi, the CIA eye who helped US hunt down Osama bin Laden , remains in a Pakistani jail. Did Trump forget to tell the Pakistanis, or did they refuse to humour him?The answer can shed some light on his baffling flip-flop relationship with Pakistan It's baffling because Trump's original attitude towards Pakistan left no room for a relationship at all. ""Get it straight: Pakistan is not our friend,"" he tweeted in December 2011. And again in Jan 2012, before asking in June that year, ""When will Pakistan apologise to us for providing safe sanctuary to Osama bin Laden for 6 years?! Some 'ally'.""Pakistan has never apologised, but within five months of Op Sindoor, PM Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir have wormed their way into Trump's good books by dangling before him goodies like a Nobel nomination, a rumour of oil, and a box of rocks.The latest from our neighbours is that they have delivered a batch of ""enriched rare earth elements and critical minerals"" to a firm in the Midwestern state of Missouri.They should have said ""sample"" because there's no way sea freight will reach Missouri from Pakistan in less than a month - the MoU was signed only on Sept 8. More than these, what's softened Trump to putty is fulsome praise. Munir recently claimed Trump saved ""millions and millions of lives"" through his alleged intervention in Op Sindoor.But go a long, long way back, like 40 years, when Trump wasn't 40 yet, and only once married.He already had a dim view of Pakistan as a prospective rogue nuclear state, and to pre-empt that, he told Ron Rosenbaum this in a 1985 interview: ""You start off telling them, 'Let's get rid of it.' If that doesn't work you then start cutting off aid. And more aid and then more. You do whatever is necessary so these people will have riots in the street, so they can't get water. So they can't get Band-Aids, so they can't get food. ""Yet, after railing for Decemberades, late in 2017 he had a change of heart: ""Starting to develop a much better relationship with Pakistan and its leaders.""But just two months later, he changed his mind: ""The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & Decembereit, thinking of our leaders as fools.""Also: ""We paid Pakistan Billions of Dollars & they never told us he (Osama) was living there...We no longer pay Pakistan the $Billions because they would take our money and do nothing for us, Bin Laden being a prime example, Afghanistan being another.""If the past five months are a sign, Trump seems to have got over his old mistrust of Pakistan completely. Heck, he's practically kissed them with a 19% tariff. Whether this relationship is of the blood-is-thicker-than-water type, or of the oil-is-thicker-than-blood type, time will tell, but with Afridi still in jail, it's a fair bet that Sharif-Munir is stringing Trump along.How's that? Maybe they take him for one of their own. There was that old conspiracy theory about him being a local boy, remember? According to Pakistani channel Neo News, Trump was born Dawood Ibrahim Khan in Waziristan, in 1946, and brought to US in 1955 after his parents' death in a car crash.If only it were true, it would explain so much. For instance, the liberties Pakistan takes with readouts of its Trump meetings. It claimed in December 2016 that Trump had told then PM Nawaz Sharif, Shehbaz's elder brother: ""You have a very good reputation. You are a terrific guy"", and Pakistan is a ""fantastic country, fantastic place"", although the US version said nothing of the kind.After last week's closed-door meeting, on which US kept mum, Pakistan claimed Trump showed ""open support of Pakistan's role in counter-terrorism and emphasised the need to further increase security and intelligence cooperation"".But it might be that Trump himself has bought into the myth of his Pakistani origin. Which would explain why he hankers for Bagram, which is 50 minutes by air from Waziristan. And isn't Pakistan the model for what he wants US to be? Army out in cities, opponents in jail, no rights worth the name, and best of all, nobody to stop him from a third - and fourth and fifth - term in office!","Trump's original attitude towards Pakistan left no room for a relationship at all.

A massive blaze gutted the beachfront home of South Carolina Circuit Court Judge Diane Goodstein on Saturday morning, leaving her ex-senator husband, Arnold Goodstein, and two other family members hospitalized.Goodstein's four-bedroom, four-bath $1,155,200 home, stretching up a three-story property on Edisto Beach, was engulfed in flames around 11.30 am as stunned neighbors looked on. Authorities have launched an investigation into the cause, while dramatic drone footage captured the inferno consuming the residence.The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) is investigating the fire, a spokesperson confirmed. Although Goodstein was not present at the time, multiple family members, including her ex-senator husband Arnold Goodstein, were at home. South Carolina Chief Justice John Kittredge stated that the fire resulted from an ""apparent explosion,"" Daily Mail reported""Judge Goodstein was walking on the beach when the fire started. Her husband, Arnie, was in the house with children and perhaps grandchildren. The family had to escape by jumping from a window or balcony. I’m told there were injuries from the fall, such as broken legs,"" Kittredge said.Of the three family members hospitalised, Arnold Goodstein is reported to have leaped from the burning building after assisting other family members to escape.""Arnie’s injuries may have been the most serious, for he was airlifted to the hospital,"" Kittredge added.He sustained multiple broken bones in his hips, legs and feet, according to reports. Another hospitalised individual is reported to be Goodstein's son, Arnold Goodstein II.Their current condition remains unclear.Kittredge mentioned that SLED chief Mark Keel stated he would stay in touch and inform if there is any evidence of arson. ""At this time, we do not know whether the fire was accidental or arson. Until that determination is made, Chief Keel has alerted local law enforcement to provide extra patrols and security,"" he added.Goodstein had reportedly been receiving death threats in recent weeks. ""She's had multiple death threats over the years,"" a judge close to Goodstein told the outlet. In early September, she was involved in a controversial case regarding whether voters' personal information in South Carolina could be handed over to the government.Goodstein issued a temporary restraining order in early September, stemming from a lawsuit challenging the South Carolina Election Commission's ability to provide voters’ data to the Department of Justice, The Gazette reported.However, the order was later overturned after a six-page opinion from the Supreme Court criticised Goodstein's process in barring the state from complying. The Supreme Court, signed by all five justices, criticised Goodstein for not detailing the damage that would occur from the release of voters' personal information, specifically that of Calhoun County voter Anne Crook, who filed the suit to prevent her information from being disclosed to the federal govt.","A massive blaze gutted the beachfront home of South Carolina Circuit Court Judge Diane Goodstein on Saturday morning.

H-1B Visa Shock Explained: $100K Annual Fee Announced by Donald Trump





The University of Southern California has issued a travel warning urging its faculty and staff who are on H-1B visas to defer international travel until further guidance is available on the visa issue. The university's student newspaper reported about the advisory that also urged staff outside the US to come back to the country.“Out of an abundance of caution, all faculty and staff in H-1B status currently in the U.S. should put international travel plans on hold until they receive further guidance,” the statement obtained by the outlet reads. “If possible, any faculty and staff in H-1B status who are currently outside the US are strongly recommended to return to the US before the proclamation takes effect.”The proclamation took effect from September 21 two days after Trump signed it, requiring employers to pay $100,000 fee for each new H-1B petition filed after September 21. Tech companies were in a disarray initially but it was later clarified that there was no need to rush back staff outside the country, as it won't affect existing staff. Existing H‑1B holders, as well as renewals and amendments, are exempt from the fee, and certain additional exemptions are available.“One of the primary reasons why people come here as well is because of the international reputation of the American education system,” Aisling Kelliher, an associate professor of cinematic arts at USC who came to the US on H-1B said. “It’s a huge opportunity, both to come here as an immigrant and to receive an education, and then also to be able to continue as a researcher and as a teacher within the system that you’ve learned from. ”The H-1B visa fee is now being challenged in court, as a group comprising unions, employers, and religious organisations has filed a federal lawsuit aiming to prevent the implementation of a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas for highly skilled foreign workers.","University of Southern California has issued a travel warning for H-1B faculty.

Pam Bondi goes on offensive in senate hearing: Accuses senator Blumenthal of lying; dodges Epstein questions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pam-bondi-goes-on-the-offensive-in-senate-hearing-accuses-senator-blumenthal-of-lying-dodges-epstein-questions/articleshow/124369327.cms,"Pam Bondi at the senate hearing (AP)





US attorney general Pam Bondi came under fire Tuesday during a Senate judiciary committee oversight hearing, adopting a combative stance with Democratic senators and refusing to engage with questions about the Jeffrey Epstein files. She accused Senator Richard Blumenthal of lying about his military service while deflecting probes into her former lobbying firm and other controversies.Blumenthal pressed Bondi about lobbying connections, asking, “In the merger … involving American Express GBT … I understand that Brian Ballard, longtime backer and head of the law firm where you worked, was instrumental in lobbying the Justice Department to drop that lawsuit. … What conversations did you have with Mr. Ballard?” as quoted by The Hill.In response, Bondi pivoted angrily, saying: “Senator Blumenthal, I cannot believe that you would accuse me of impropriety when you lied about your military service. You lied, you admitted you lied to be elected a US senator,” she said.“How dare you? I’m a career prosecutor. Don’t you ever challenge my integrity … Do not question my ability to be fair and impartial as attorney general, and anything [about] my former firm Ballard Partners.”Blumenthal had acknowledged in 2010 that he “misspoke” about serving in Vietnam.When the topic shifted to Epstein, Bondi repeatedly stalled and refused to engage. Senator Dick Durbin asked who ordered a justice department statement that Trump’s name was in the Epstein files.Bondi replied, “I’m not going to discuss anything about that with you.” Durbin warned: “Eventually you’re going to have to answer for your conduct in this, you won’t do it today, but eventually you will,” according to Miami Herald.Bondi remained defiant, citing partisan claims and repeatedly attacking her interrogators rather than addressing substantive questions.Throughout the hearing, Bondi defended the justice department’s approach under the Trump administration, accusing Democrats of politicizing the department. She also shifted attention toward her critics, questioning why they had not previously released Epstein files when Democrats had held majorities.She specifically invoked Reid Hoffman, a tech billionaire linked in past fundraising to Epstein, asking Democrats why they failed to disclose associated flight logs or donor ties.When Democratic senator Sheldon Whitehouse raised a question about reports alleging that Epstein possessed photos of Donald Trump with “half-naked young women,” and whether those images were part of the justice department’s Epstein files, Bondi deflected by targeting the senator instead.“Senator Whitehouse, instead of making baseless insinuations about President Trump, perhaps you should address your own political ties - especially your connections to one of Epstein’s known associates,” Bondi shot back.She employed a similar tactic when Senator Dick Durbin questioned her about a July memo from the Justice Department stating that no new information had been uncovered in the Epstein files. “I’m not going to engage on that topic,” Bondi said, sidestepping the question.Bondi then cited a claim popular among Trump-aligned supporters - MAGA, suggesting Democrats had resisted calls to release the Epstein flight logs when they held a congressional majority because individuals linked to their party might be implicated.The attorney general was in fight mode throughout the hearing, pushing back against questions related to national guard deployments in US cities and allegations of politicising the justice department.The hearing’s tensions underline the growing scrutiny over Bondi’s handling of sensitive federal investigations and her role as chief law enforcement officer under Trump.","Pam Bondi accused Senator Richard Blumenthal of lying about his military service while deflecting probes into her former lobbying firm and other controversies.

India Won't Hold Back in Operation Sindoor 2.0: Army Chief Dwivedi Sends Clear Message To Pakistan





ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Army on Saturday criticised the recent remarks made by the Indian military officers and political leaders, warning that a future conflict between the two countries might lead to a ""cataclysmic devastation"".In a statement, it also said that these ""irresponsible statements"" indicate a renewed attempt at ""fabricating arbitrary pretexts for aggression"" - a prospect which might ""lead to serious consequences"" for peace and stability in South Asia.A day earlier, defence minister Rajnath Singh had said India can cross any border whenever necessary to protect citizens and safeguard India's unity and integrity. Indian Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Friday issued a stern warning to Pakistan , saying the neighbouring country should stop sponsoring terrorism on its soil if it wants to retain its place on the world map.General Dwivedi also said the restraint shown by New Delhi during Operation Sindoor would not be repeated in case of a future military conflict and urged Indian soldiers to remain poised for action.Also, chief of air staff Air Chief Marshal A P Singh on Friday said that at least a dozen Pakistani military aircraft, including US-origin F-16 jets, were destroyed or damaged in Indian strikes during Operation Sindoor.In its statement, the Pakistan Army said that it noted with ""grave concern"" the ""delusional, provocative and jingoistic statements"" coming from the highest levels of the Indian security establishment.""In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian Defence Minister and its Army and Air Chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint,"" it said.The statement said that Pakistan has established a ""new normal of response"", which will be ""swift, decisive and destructive"".It added that the armed forces of Pakistan have the capability and resolve ""to take the fight to every nook and corner of the enemy's territory"".The statement also responded to the threat of ""erasing Pakistan from the map"", saying India ""must know that if a situation comes, the erasure will be mutual"".It also said that earlier this year, the Indian attack against Pakistan brought two nuclear powers to the brink of a major war. ""...India now seems to be aching for the next round of confrontation,"" it added.In response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in territories controlled by Pakistan.The strikes triggered four days of intense clashes that ended with an understanding on stopping the military actions on May 10.On Thursday, defence minister Singh said any misadventure by Islamabad in the Sir Creek sector will invite a ""decisive response"" that could be strong enough to change both ""history and geography"".Sir Creek is a 96-km-long tidal estuary between Gujarat's Rann of Kutch and Pakistan and is considered a disputed region due to varying interpretations of maritime boundary lines by both sides.

A day after Pakistan 's foreign minister Ishaq Dar said that Donald Trump 's Gaza peace plan was not endorsed by Pakistan, Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President's plan calling it a ""step towards ending bloodshed.""In a social media post on X, Shehbaz thanked Trump and leaders of Arab and Muslim states for their efforts to bring peace in Palestine.“Alhamdolillah, we are closer to a ceasefire than we have been since this genocide was launched on the Palestinian people. Pakistan has always stood by the Palestinian people and shall always do so,” Shehbaz said.""Gratitude is due to President Trump, as well as to leaderships of Qatar, Saudia Arabia, UAE, Turkiye, Jordan, Egypt, and Indonesia who, met with President Trump on the sidelines of #UNGA80 for the resolution of the Palestinian issue. The statement issued by Hamas creates a window for a ceasefire and ensuring peace that we must not allow to close again. InshaAllah, Pakistan will continue to work with all its partners and brotherly nations to everlasting peace in Palestine,"" he added.Shehbaz took a U-turn as his deputy Dar had claimed that Trump’s version of the peace plan was not the one proposed by the bloc of eight Muslim-majority nations that met the US president on September 22 on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.“I made it clear that the 20 points that President Trump made public are not ours. Changes were made to our draft. I have the record,” Dar said, emphasising that “there is no room for politicking” on the issue.Dar explained that the plan took shape during a meeting between Trump and foreign ministers of eight countries - Pakistan, Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt - on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session. He said the group had prepared a counter-draft to the US proposal, focusing on an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and an end to the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza.Dar also reaffirmed that Pakistan will never recognise Israel and continues to back the two-state solution based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al Sharif (Jerusalem) as the capital of a future Palestinian state. He stressed that Pakistan’s stance remains unchanged.Dar also confirmed that the plan envisions deploying an international peacekeeping force in Palestine, and said Pakistan’s leadership would soon decide on contributing troops.Under Donald Trump’s proposed plan, military operations in Gaza would be suspended, existing battle lines would remain in place, and a temporary “technocratic, non-political” Palestinian administration would be established. The plan also calls for creating a “Board of Peace,” chaired by Trump, with former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair reportedly serving as an adviser.On Friday, Trump said Hamas must accept the proposed Gaza peace plan by Sunday, warning that failure to do so would result in further attacks.This comes as Hamas accepted some elements of Trump's plan to end the nearly two-year war and return all the remaining hostages taken in the October 7, 2023, attack.Hamas said it was willing to release the hostages and hand over power to other Palestinians, but that other aspects of the plan require further consultations among Palestinians. Senior Hamas officials suggested there were still major disagreements that required further negotiations.","Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President's plan calling it a ""step towards ending bloodshed"" On Friday, Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar said that Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan was not endorsed by Pakistan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124307060,imgsize-660599,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

At Least 24 Killed As Pakistan Air Force Bombs Tirah Village In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa





At least four students were injured when a bomb exploded inside a private school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, northwestern Pakistan, authorities said on Saturday.According to the school administration, a fourth-grade student picked up a “toy bomb” on his way to school in Jamrud tehsil, Khyber district, near the Afghan border and brought it into his classroom on Friday.Local authorities explained that “toy bombs” are actually abandoned mortar shells found in the province, especially near the Afghan border, which children often mistake for toys. The bomb exploded when the student dropped it on the classroom floor.The injured students were immediately taken to a hospital in Peshawar for treatment and were later discharged, news agency PTI reported.Security forces have blocked off the area and launched a search operation to locate and defuse any remaining unexploded shells to prevent further accidents. Police have also initiated an investigation into the incident.Incidents involving abandoned mortar shells are common in the region. Last year, on December 27, four boys were killed and two critically injured when an old mortar shell exploded in Bajaur district.Such devices continue to pose serious risks to local communities, particularly children, in heavily mined tribal areas along the Afghanistan border.","At least four students were injured when a bomb exploded inside a private school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, northwestern Pakistan.

PoJK protests at the core







Protests in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) continued for a sixth consecutive day on Friday, spilling into the country’s capital, triggering a shocking police raid on the Islamabad National Press Club (NPC) that left several journalists injured and equipment vandalised.The assault has sparked nationwide outrage, with journalist unions announcing a “Black Day” in protest against what they called an attack on press freedom, ANI reported.Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday, where members of the Lawyers’ Community of PoK were holding a peaceful demonstration in solidarity with ongoing protests in the region.Visuals widely shared on social media showed baton-wielding policemen dragging journalists, smashing cameras, and assaulting media staff inside the club premises. In one video, a photojournalist could be seen with a torn shirt and a broken camera.The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) strongly condemned the attack, calling it one of the “darkest days” in Pakistan’s history.PFUJ President Afzal Butt said black flags would be hoisted at press clubs across the country in solidarity. “This is not only the Islamabad press club's issue,” Butt said at a press conference.“Press clubs across Pakistan believe that if they ignore this worst incident, tomorrow it could be Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar or Quetta,” he added.Videos circulating on social media show Pakistani Rangers using tear gas shells and live ammunition to disperse crowds. Internet, mobile, and landline services have been shut down, cutting off residents from their families and worsening the crisis.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident and ordered an inquiry into the raid. “Violence against the journalist community cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” Naqvi said, promising disciplinary action against those responsible.However, journalist unions rejected what they termed “mere promises.” They warned that if the government continued to use police action to suppress dissent, the protests would intensify.The Islamabad incident comes amid massive protests in PoK, which have entered their sixth consecutive day.The protests, which began two years ago, were initially sparked by demands for political reforms, subsidised wheat flour, reduced electricity tariffs, free education and healthcare, and an end to privileges for government officials.The unrest intensified after at least three civilians were killed during police firing in Muzaffarabad, ANI reported.Their funeral processions drew thousands, fuelling more anger. Reports suggest that over 10 people have died in the clashes so far, with many critically injured.","Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday.

Pak Parliamentarian Mocks Army Chief Munir As ‘Salesman’, PM Sharif As ‘Manager’ Over Trump Meeting





The Commonwealth Observer Group (COG) has officially released its report on Pakistan’s 2024 general elections, noting “conditions that appeared to impact one party’s ability to fairly contest the election” — namely the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), led by incarcerated former Prime Minister Imran Khan The report, which included a ""Letter of Transmittal"" by COG chairperson and former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, cited the denial to PTI of its election symbol, Khan’s consecutive convictions ahead of polling, and restrictions on freedom of association and assembly.Jonathan wrote: “When looked at in isolation, some – though not all – of the arguments advanced by key institutions in support of their actions appear somewhat justifiable. Yet, collectively, it could not go unnoticed that these decisions consistently limited one party's ability to contest the election on a level playing field.”The observers expressed particular concern over the Supreme Court of Pakistan’s revocation of PTI’s iconic “bat” symbol — linked to Khan’s cricketing past — on grounds that the party failed to hold intra-party elections. With the decision coming just weeks before polling, PTI candidates were forced to run as independents, depriving them of a unifying symbol.The group also flagged Khan’s multiple convictions shortly before polling day, along with restrictions on PTI’s rallies and gatherings. “There were also limitations on fundamental political rights, including freedom of association and assembly. These limitations were felt most acutely by PTI and its supporters,” the report said.The COG called for reforms to strengthen transparency and ensure a level playing field for all parties in future Pakistani elections.The report found that mainstream English-language media “broadly followed the principles of fair and accurate election reporting,” though PTI-affiliated independent candidates received ""less positive"" coverage.By contrast, state-owned PTV News lacked balance, focusing mainly on the ruling PML-N and PPP, and reportedly barred references to Khan by name. The group concluded that these factors may have “impinged on the credibility, transparency and inclusiveness of the electoral process.”The report had been controversial after media reports suggested the Commonwealth had “buried” it following widespread problems in the February 8 polls. Submitted to the Commonwealth secretary-general on November 20, 2024, the publication was delayed without explanation.The PTI had repeatedly demanded its release, arguing it confirmed “systemic rigging, institutional bias, and deliberate targeting” of the party and its founder.","Commonwealth Observer Group releases report on Pakistan's 2024 general elections.

From fields to fame: Majestic water buffaloes crowned in Chonburi; crowds applaud Thailand’s unique beauty contest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/from-fields-to-fame-majestic-water-buffaloes-crowned-in-chonburi-crowds-applaud-thailands-unique-beauty-contest/articleshow/124364600.cms,"(Photo credit: AP)





Five-year-old Tod made his debut at the annual water buffalo racing and beauty festival held in Chonburi on Monday. Chonburi is a city in the province of Thailand, about an hour's drive from Bangkok.Tod, the prized stud of food vendor and farmer Thawatchai Daeng-Ngam, was one of the stars of the event, stealing the show. His bright red ears stood out against his sleek black fur.Once considered humble draft animals vital to Thai agriculture, water buffaloes have now become prized show animals. The festival, held at the end of the 11th lunar month to mark the start of the harvest season, celebrates these animals that once ploughed fields and transported heavy loads. Today, many buffaloes are raised for competitions or sold for meat.The Chonburi festival featured a parade of buffaloes adorned with flower crowns, pulling traditional wooden carriages with wheels over 2 metres tall, and carrying owners and women dressed in traditional Thai attire. The event also included a 100-metre sprint race, with jockeys riding the buffaloes at full speed.Pitun Rassamee competed with his three-year-old albino buffalo, Lookaew, which had already won several local pageants. “Although buffaloes can still work in the field, they cannot compete with machines,” said Thawatchai, whose family owns 30 buffaloes, including Tod. “Buffaloes are still important to me. It’s like what they said: ‘People raise buffaloes, and buffaloes raise people.’ They’re like family members,” he added, according to news agency AP The shift from farm labourers to show animals has come with the mechanization of farming and a decline in buffalo populations. Competitions have sparked renewed interest and a growing industry, supported by the government. Since 2017, Thailand has observed Thai Buffalo Conservation Day, and local authorities provide breeding assistance to farmers.Raising a show buffalo can be intensive. On larger farms, animals are bathed daily and fed a special diet of corn, soybeans, bran, and vitamins. At the festival, caretakers splashed water over the larger, prize-winning animals, which are judged on horn size, hoof smoothness, and overall physique.“Each year, it has become bigger and bigger,” said Papada Srisophon, assistant to a village chief near a livestock centre. “Without this activity, they won’t know what to do with their buffaloes, and they won’t be motivated to keep their buffaloes,” she told AP.For many owners, the competitions are more than just sport or show, they reflect a lifelong bond with the animals.","Chonburi is a city in the province of Thailand, about an hour's drive from Bangkok.

Israel Says Yes, Hamas Says No? Decoding Why Trump’s 20-Point Gaza Peace Is A Dud





Pakistan has formally distanced itself from the 20-point Gaza peace plan unveiled by US President Donald Trump, with country’s foreign minister and deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar telling the national assembly that the final proposal presented by the US was not endorsed by Pakistan or fully representative of the original draft prepared by a group of Muslim and Arab countries.“I made it clear that the 20 points that President Trump made public are not ours. Changes were made to our draft. I have the record,” Dar said, emphasising that “there is no room for politicking” on the issue.Dar explained that the plan took shape during a meeting between Trump and foreign ministers of eight countries - Pakistan, Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt - on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session. He said the group had prepared a counter-draft to the US proposal, focusing on an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and an end to the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza.Also read: Who will govern Gaza? Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan — Explained While Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif initially welcomed the peace plan and reiterated support for a two-state solution, the endorsement drew sharp criticism at home. Many in Pakistan labelled it a “surrender” and questioned the absence of a clear roadmap to Palestinian statehood in the US version of the plan.Dar highlighted key differences between Pakistan’s draft and Trump’s final proposal, particularly regarding the extent of Israeli withdrawal and the disarmament of Hamas. Pakistan’s position called for a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, while the US proposal suggested a phased withdrawal linked to the release of hostages.“President Trump's committee also came and open talks were held on what they wanted. They gave us a 20-point proposal,” Dar said. Over the next 24 hours, the eight countries exchanged revised drafts informally. “We were exchanging hard copies in hotel rooms,” he recalled.Dar said while there was an initial effort to seek joint signatures from all foreign ministers, consensus on that point was not reached. After Trump's meeting with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu on September 29, the US publicly announced the 20-point plan. Dar later learned from the Saudi foreign minister that some of the urgent proposals by the eight countries had been accepted, while others were left for further dialogue.He reaffirmed Pakistan’s long-standing policy on Palestine. “Pakistan’s policy on Palestine remained the same as that of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. There has not been any change nor will there ever be,” Dar said, reiterating support for an independent Palestinian state with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.(with inputs from agencies)","Pakistan has formally distanced itself from the 20-point Gaza peace plan unveiled by US President Donald Trump.

At least one student was killed, dozens were injured, and 65 were feared buried in the debris after Al Khoziny Islamic boarding school building collapsed in Indonesia.Rescue workers, police, and soldiers, who had been digging through the night, pulled out eight weak and injured students more than eight hours after the collapse in Sidoarjo, East Java. Additional bodies were spotted, suggesting the death toll could rise, AP reported.Families of the students gathered at hospitals and near the collapsed building, anxiously awaiting news of their children. Relatives wailed as they watched rescuers pull a dusty, injured student from the buried prayer hall.A notice board at the command post established in the boarding school complex listed 65 students as missing as of Tuesday morning. They were mostly boys in Class 7 to Class 11, aged between twelve and seventeen.“Oh my God... my son is still buried, oh my God please help!” a mother cried hysterically upon seeing her child's name on the board, followed by the cries of other parents facing similar losses.“Please, sir, please find my child immediately,” pleaded a father, holding the hand of one of the rescue team members. Heavy slabs of concrete, rubble, and unstable parts of the building hampered search and rescue efforts, said Nanang Sigit, a search and rescue officer leading the operation.Heavy equipment was available but not being used due to concerns it could cause further collapse. “We have been running oxygen and water to those still trapped under the debris and keeping them alive while we work hard to get them out,” Sigit said.He added that rescuers had seen several bodies under the rubble but were focused on saving those still alive. Several hundred rescuers participated in the effort, equipped with breathing apparatus, extrication tools, medical evacuation equipment, and other support devices.The students had been performing afternoon prayers in a building undergoing an unauthorised expansion when it suddenly collapsed on top of them, provincial police spokesperson Jules Abraham Abast said. Residents, teachers, and administrators assisted injured students, many with head injuries and broken bones.Female students were praying in another part of the building and managed to escape, survivors said. One male student, a thirteen-year-old boy, was killed, and ninety-nine other students were injured and taken to hospitals, some in critical condition, officials said. Authorities were investigating the cause of the collapse. Abast said the old prayer hall was two stories, but two additional floors were being added without a permit.“The old building's foundation was apparently unable to support two floors of concrete and collapsed during the pouring process,” Abast said.","Rescue workers, police, and soldiers pulled out eight weak and injured students more than eight hours after the collapse in Sidoarjo, East Java.

Nepal PM Oli ‘Planning To Flee To Dubai’, Gen Z Bring ‘Corrupt’ Govt To Its Knees | Watch





Nepal's former Prime Minister and CPN-UML chairman KP Sharma Oli has publicly dismissed speculation that he plans to leave the country, accusing the Sushila Karki-led government of attempting to strip him of his security and official entitlements amid ongoing political tension, reported news agency ANI.Addressing a gathering of Yuwa Sangh Nepal, the youth wing of his party, in Gundu, Bhaktapur, Oli declared, ""Do you think we will flee by handing over the nation to this groundless government?"" He said he remained committed to restoring “peace, good governance and constitutional order”, as quoted by the agency.Oli’s remarks come weeks after the fall of his government on September 9, which followed large-scale Gen Z-led protests. Since vacating the Prime Minister’s official residence in Baluwatar, Oli has relocated to a rented house in Gundu, following an arson attack on his private residence in Balkot by protestors.The CPN-UML chief alleged that the current administration lacked democratic legitimacy and was formed through “vandalism and arson”, not the people’s mandate.Challenging the government to disclose any communication he had with state authorities during the protests, Oli said, “Publish them with courage.Make public the instructions I gave.” He denied any wrongdoing and questioned the basis of efforts to link him to the violent unrest.He also raised concerns over reported threats to his safety and criticised the government for inaction. “On social media, there are open calls to attack my residence. What is the government doing? Just watching?” he asked.The former PM expressed strong objection to reports that the government was planning to withhold passports of several political leaders, including himself, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, Arzu Rana Deuba, Ramesh Lekhak, and Deepak Khadka.Oli accused the ruling dispensation of creating a climate of insecurity and targeting opposition leaders. “This government is throwing the country into insecurity,” he alleged.Meanwhile, a recent monitoring report by Nepal’s national human rights commission (NHRC) blamed the previous government, led by Oli and then-home minister Ramesh Lekhak, for failing to anticipate the scale of the Gen Z protests. The NHRC said that while the initial demonstrations on September 8 were peaceful, the use of excessive force by security personnel on September 9 led to dozens of deaths and widespread violence.Rights groups have held Oli and Lekhak accountable for the crackdown, which played a key role in the fall of their administration. The NHRC report highlighted poor coordination, declining morale among security forces, and inadequate preparation as contributing factors to the high casualties.","KP Sharma Oli accuses Sushila Karki-led government of attempting to strip him of his security and official entitlements.

Farage ‘Exposes’ Starmer’s ‘Islamophobia Law In Britain’ Bid Amid Showdown In US House | Watch





LONDON: A British Sikh organisation has threatened to take legal action against the UK government over a potential new definition of Islamophobia and the decision to appoint a working group to develop one, pointing out that any government-backed definition risks discriminating against other faiths.The Network of Sikh organisations (NSO), an umbrella body for Sikhs in the UK, has sent a pre-action letter to communities secretary Steve Reed, raising concerns over the impact of any definition on Sikhs and on freedom of religion and speech in Britain.The anti-Muslim hatred/Islamophobia working group was set up in March 2025 to develop a non-statutory definition of Islamophobia to provide the UK government and other relevant bodies with a greater understanding of prejudice against Muslims. Ministers may opt not to accept the definition.The letter that the NSO is preparing to seek a judicial review.The NSO argues that any definition of Islamophobia will also interfere with the right of Sikhs and others to freely manifest their religion and beliefs, a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.Lord Singh of Wimbledon, director of NSO, wrote: “Sikhs are strictly forbidden to eat halal slaughtered meat because halal slaughter, especially non-stun slaughter, is inhumane.”Yet just asserting this would, by virtue of the 2018 definition of Islamophobia by the All-Party-Parliamentary-Group (APPG) on Muslims, be considered Islamophobic, he wrote.The ninth Sikh Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur, gave his life defending the freedom of belief of Hindus who were being forced to convert to Islam. “Simply recounting this historical truth would be deemed Islamophobic according to the APPG definition,” Singh wrote.“There are countless other examples of Sikh (and indeed other religious and philosophical) beliefs and practices which would offend people of the Islamic faith,” he wrote.His letter also criticises the consultation exercise, saying it was carried out privately with select groups and that NSO was not invited to provide evidence.Officials at the ministry of housing, communities and local govt (MHCLG) told TOI they had received the letter and would reply shortly. The working group received a response to the call for evidence from the NSO. “The concerns they raised have informed the work,” a source said. “Any proposed definition must be compatible with the right to freedom of speech. That includes the right to … insult religions.”A MHCLG spokesperson said, “No decisions on a definition have been made, and we will not accept any definition which damages freedom of speech or discriminates against religious communities.”","Network of Sikh organisations (NSO), an umbrella body for Sikhs in the UK, has sent a pre-action letter to communities secretary Steve Reed.

Police have dismantled an international organized crime gang believed to have smuggled up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones from the UK to China over the past year, worth millions of pounds.In what the Metropolitan Police describe as the UK’s largest operation targeting phone theft, 18 suspects were arrested and more than 2,000 stolen devices recovered.Two Afghan nationals were arrested last month on suspicion of operating a network believed to traffic up to 40% of all iPhones stolen in London. Authorities say the gang was moving devices to China on an ""industrial scale,"" where the latest models can fetch £3,700 each.“This is the largest crackdown on mobile phone theft and robbery in the UK in the most extraordinary set of operations of this kind that the Met has ever undertaken. We are talking about some serious criminality here,"" commander Andrew Featherstone was quoted as saying by the Mirror.Police estimate the group could be responsible for exporting as many as half of all stolen phones from London, the city where the majority of UK mobile thefts occur.The investigation was triggered after a victim traced a stolen phone last year.""It was actually on Christmas Eve and a victim electronically tracked their stolen iPhone to a warehouse near Heathrow Airport ,"" detective inspector Mark Gavin was quoted as saying by the BBC.""The security there was eager to help out and they found the phone was in a box, among another 894 phones.""Officers found that nearly all the phones were stolen and were being shipped to Hong Kong. Additional shipments were intercepted, and forensic analysis of the packages helped identify two suspects.As the investigation zeroed in on the suspects, police bodycam footage captured a dramatic mid-road interception, with some officers drawing Tasers.Dozens of phones were found in the vehicle, many wrapped in foil in an apparent attempt to conceal them, and roughly 2,000 additional devices were recovered from properties linked to the suspects.A third suspect, a 29-year-old Indian national, has also been charged with the same offences.Last week, police arrested an additional 15 individuals on suspicion of theft, handling stolen property, and conspiracy to commit theft.Most of the suspects are women, including a Bulgarian national, and around 30 devices were seized during early morning raids.The number of phones stolen in London has nearly tripled over the past four years, rising from 28,609 in 2020 to 80,588 in 2024. London now accounts for three-quarters of all mobile phone thefts in the UK, as cited by the BBC.""This is, without doubt, the largest operation of its kind in UK history, and it was humbling to see first-hand how the Met are going after the leaders of international smuggling gangs as well as the street robbers and snatchers fueling this industrial scale crime,"" Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said.","Gang believed to have smuggled up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones from the UK to China over the past year. 18 suspects arrested and more than 2,000 devices recovered in UK's largest operation targeting phone theft. Police estimate the group could be responsible for exporting up to half of all stolen phones from London.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124354551,imgsize-407098,width-400,resizemode-4/image-xvikingfbr.jpg"

Here's what we know about attack

Al-Shamie, who was on bail in rape case, may have been 'influenced by extreme Islamist ideology'



Six people arrested in this case



How the attack unfolded



Witnesses recall chaos of attack







At least two Jewish were killed and three others critically injured in a car-ramming and stabbing attack outside Manchester’s Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue on Yom Kippur.Police identified the victims as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66. Authorities confirmed that one victim was fatally hit by police gunfire during their response to the assailant, calling it a “tragic and unforeseen consequence.”The suspect, 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, a British national of Syrian descent, was shot dead on site. Investigators are treating the assault as a suspected terror attack.The suspect, a British citizen of Syrian descent who was living in Prestwitch, Manchester, entered the UK as a very young child and was granted British citizenship in 2006 as a minor.Greater Manchester Police said late on Friday that at this stage in its investigation it believes Al-Shamie ""may have been influenced by extreme Islamist ideology."" However, it said establishing the full circumstances of the attack will likely take some time.The suspect's name has not appeared in initial searches of police and security service counter-terrorism records. But Greater Manchester Police said he had a non-counter-terror criminal history, including ""a recent arrest for rape, which resulted in him being bailed.""His family said in a statement: ""We fully distance ourselves from this attack and express our deep shock and sorrow over what has happened. Our hearts and thoughts are with the victims and their families, and we pray for their strength and comfort.""In a statement, the UK police revealed that they have arrested six people in the Manchester synagogue attack. All the six were arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism.“We have now arrested three further people, one man and two women, aged between 18 and mid-40s. This brings the number of people in custody arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism to six,"" the police said in a statement.“We will be seeking warrants of further detention for all six individuals and will seek to issue an update on this later,"" it added.Police responded to reports of a car driving towards members of the public and a man stabbing at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue at 09.31 BST on Thursday.Officers declared a major incident and arrived at the scene in north Manchester within seven minutes, shooting dead the suspect at 09.38 BST, who police said had a bomb.A large number of people were worshipping at the synagogue at the time and were held inside while the surrounding area was made safe. Greater Manchester Police said worshippers and security staff demonstrated ""immediate bravery"" and helped stop the attacker from entering the building.In an update on Friday evening, police said witnesses had described seeing a man ""acting suspiciously"" outside the synagogue before the attack, who then walked away after being confronted by security. The police said they do not believe that incident was reported to them, but about 15 minutes later ""the individual returned in a vehicle and began his horrific attack"".""We have been told from witness accounts that a man was seen acting suspiciously outside the synagogue before he was confronted by security and walked away. Based on the information we have at this time, we don’t believe this was reported to Greater Manchester Police because the man had left the area. Around 15 minutes later, the individual returned in a vehicle and began his horrific attack,"" the police said in a statement.“There were a large number of worshippers in attendance but thanks to the bravery of security staff, worshippers and the fast action of the police, the attacker was prevented from gaining access,"" they added.Shah, a local resident, said she was driving past the synagogue when she saw a vehicle ""just sort of rushing past and driving straight for the members of the public"". She then saw a man ""jump out"" and start running towards the people ""with a knife and he just started going on a bit of a rampage"", she said, calling the scene ""traumatising"".Inside the synagogue, Rabbi Daniel Walker described running into the foyer and seeing ""a terrorist trying to batter his way into the synagogue"". He told the BBC the attacker was ""body-charging the doors, throwing heavy plant pots at the doors, doing everything he could to get in"", as he and others held the entrance doors shut.Outside, Tonge said once police arrived, ""they gave him [the attacker] a couple of warnings, he didn't listen so they opened fire,"" adding that the man holding the knife went down on the floor.The man then ""started getting back up and they [the police] shot him again"", Tonge added – describing it as ""nerve-racking"" to witness.A bomb disposal unit was deployed after ""suspicious items"" were spotted around the suspect's waist - police later confirmed the device was ""fake"".An SAS helicopter, dubbed ""Blue Thunder"", was seen flying above the area later. The aircraft, and the troops it carries, are part of a national airborne counter-terrorism response. The attack was later declared a terrorist incident.","Suspect, 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, a British national of Syrian descent, was shot dead on site.

LONDON: For the first time in the Church of England’s 491-year history, a woman has been appointed to lead it.On Friday Downing Street announced that Bishop of London Dame Sarah Mullally, 63, who became a Christian aged 16, would be the successor to Justin Welby who resigned in Jan over his handling of a child sex abuse scandal.Currently known as the Archbishop of Canterbury-designate, she will legally become the 106th Archbishop of Canterbury at her confirmation of election at St Paul’s Cathedral in Jan 2026, with a service of installation taking place at Canterbury Cathedral in March 2026.Mullally has been Bishop of London since 2018, the first woman appointed to that role too. Prior to her ordination in 2001, she was chief nursing officer for England — the youngest person ever to be appointed to that role at the age of 37 — having previously specialised as a cancer nurse.The Crown Nominations Commission (CNC) for Canterbury nominated Mullaly following a process of public consultation and prayerful discernment that began in Feb. The CNC was made up of representatives from the Church of England, global Anglican Communion and the Diocese of Canterbury.The most senior bishop in the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury’s ministry combines many roles, including serving as primus inter pares — or first among equals — of the Primates of the global Anglican Communion, which consists of around 85 million people, across 165 countries, including India.The Archbishop of Canterbury also sits in the House of Lords.Rajan Zed, president of the Universal Society of Hinduism, commended the appointment and called on the Roman Catholic Church to follow suit. Quoting Hindu scriptures, he said: “ Where women are honoured, there the Gods are pleased.”But Gafcon, a movement of Conservative global Anglicans, which is opposed to the ordination of women to holy orders, said it did not accept Mullaly as leader. “Since the newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury has failed to guard the faith and is complicit in introducing practices and beliefs that violate both the plain and canonical sense of Scripture and the Church’s historic and consensual interpretation of it, she cannot provide leadership to the Anglican Communion,” said Dr Laurent Mbanda, chairman, Gafcon Primates Council. “The majority of the Anglican Communion still believes that the Bible requires a male-only episcopacy.”","Dame Sarah Mullally, 63, became a Christian aged 16.

2 Killed in Yom Kippur Stabbing Near Manchester Synagogue, Suspect Shot by Police





One of the victims of the synagogue attack in Manchester may have been fatally shot by officers during their attempt to stop the assailant, police said on Friday.In a statement, police confirmed that the suspect, identified as Jihad Al Shamie, was not carrying a firearm. “The only shots fired were from GMP’s Authorised Firearms Officer,"" the Greater Manchester Police statement said.“It follows therefore, that subject to further forensic examination, this injury may sadly have been sustained as a tragic and unforeseen consequence of the urgently required action taken by my officers to bring this vicious attack to an end,” the statement added.The incident unfolded on Thursday outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue, where worshippers had gathered for Yom Kippur. Two people were killed and three others seriously wounded after a car was driven at a crowd, followed by a stabbing.Police had initially said the suspect was ""believed dead"" after being shot. A bomb squad was later deployed amid fears the attacker was carrying explosives.The two victims were identified as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66. Three others remain in hospital in serious condition.The assault took place Thursday morning in Crumpsall, a Manchester suburb, as worshippers gathered for Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.Police said a suspect rammed a car into pedestrians outside the Orthodox synagogue before attacking them with a knife. He was shot dead by armed officers seven minutes later. The attacker was wearing what appeared to be an explosives belt, later confirmed to be fake.Police identified the suspect as Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, a British citizen of Syrian origin who moved to the UK as a child and obtained citizenship in 2006. Authorities are still verifying whether “Al-Shamie” is his birth name. The case is being investigated as a terrorist incident, though the motive remains unclear.Three people – two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s – have been arrested on suspicion of preparing or assisting acts of terrorism. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the attacker had not previously been known to police or to Prevent, the UK’s counter-radicalisation programme. “It’s too early to say whether he acted alone or as part of a wider network,” she said.Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis condemned the attack as the product of “an unrelenting wave of Jew hatred.” Writing on social media, he said: “This is the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come.”Political and religious leaders have pledged reassurance to Britain’s 300,000-strong Jewish community following the attack.","One of the victims of the synagogue attack in Manchester may have been fatally shot by officers.

Police confirmed the victims were targeted specifically because of their faith.Starmer also addressed the public on X (formerly Twitter), writing: “This was a vile terrorist attack that attacked Jews, because they are Jews. Antisemitism is a hatred that is rising, once again. Britain must defeat it, once again. To every Jewish person in this country: I promise that I will do everything in my power to guarantee you the security you deserve.”The attack is being treated as a suspected antisemitic terror attack , with authorities alleging that the assailant deliberately targeted and killed Jewish people.Police identified the attacker as a UK citizen of Syrian origin, who was shot dead by armed officers within minutes of the first emergency call.Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the man was wearing a vest resembling an explosive device, which was later confirmed to be fake. He has been named by the police as Jihad Al-Shamie.Within hours of the attack, three other people, two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s, were arrested on suspicion of terror-related offenses, as reported by AFP.The incident unfolded on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, and was declared a terrorist incident by counter-terror officers. Many Orthodox Jewish worshippers, observing Yom Kippur without phones or computers, only learned of the attack after sundown.The attacker reportedly drove into a crowd gathered outside the Synagogue before launching a stabbing spree, leaving multiple victims seriously wounded, according to AFP. A woman who also identified as a Jew and lives next door to the synagogue said that as soon as the suspect got out of the car, he ""started stabbing anyone near him,"" reported BBC.Chief Constable Stephen Watson said the attacker first rammed a car into people gathered outside the synagogue before stabbing victims with a knife.

They praised the residents for alerting them swiftly, saying the response prevented an even greater tragedy.Two prominent Jewish organizations in the UK told CNN that the attack at the synagogue was sadly something they feared was coming. “As we emerge from the fast of Yom Kippur, the holiest day in our calendar, many in our community will only now be learning of the horrific attack on Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation in Manchester,” a joint statement from the Jewish Leadership Council and Board of Deputies of British Jews said. They called on those in positions of power and influence to take strong action to combat hatred against the Jewish community and reiterated their support for the authorities in protecting their people.The attack has drawn global condemnation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it a “barbaric attack,” while Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar accused British authorities of failing to curb antisemitic and anti-Israel incitement. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described the targeting of a synagogue on Yom Kippur as “particularly heinous,” and King Charles III and Queen Camilla said they were “deeply shocked and saddened”, reported AFP.The incident comes just days before the second anniversary of Hamas’s October 7 assault on Israel, which triggered the ongoing Gaza war. Analysts noted it was among the worst antisemitic attacks in Europe since then.Manchester, home to more than 28,000 Jews according to 2021 data, has faced grievously deadly terror attacks before, strikingly the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing that killed 22 people.",UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the attack was a targeted terrorist act against Jews.

Israel’s foreign minister Gideon Saar condemned the deadly terrorist attack that targeted a Manchester synagogue on Thursday, criticising UK authorities for what he described as their “failure to address this toxic wave of antisemitism.”“I am appalled by the murderous attack near Heaton Park Synagogue on the morning of Yom Kippur, the holiest day for the Jewish people. My deepest condolences go to the families who have lost loved ones, and I wish a swift recovery to the injured,” Saar said on X.He called for the “truth” to be told, adding: “Blatant and rampant antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement, as well as support for terror, have recently become widespread in London, other UK cities, and on campuses.”Saar further said Israel expects “more than words” from the Keir Starmer-led government, demanding “effective action and enforcement against antisemitic and anti-Israeli sentiment in Britain.”The attack, carried out with a car and a knife, left two people dead and four injured. Police neutralised the suspect and arrested two others.The incident comes ahead of the second anniversary of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel, after which Israel - a Jewish state - launched a military offensive in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. Tensions between Israel and the UK have also grown following Britain’s recent recognition of a Palestinian state, along with several other Western nations.","Gideon Saar criticises UK authorities for what he described as their “failure to address this toxic wave of antisemitism’ The attack, carried out with a car and a knife, left two people dead and four injured.
