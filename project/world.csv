Goa: 23 Killed In Arpora Nightclub Fire; Cylinder Blast Suspected, CM Sawant Vows Strict Action

PANAJI: Fifteen minutes. That's all it took for Bhavana Joshi to lose her husband and three sisters inside a nightclub that was supposed to crown a holiday in Goa with music and laughter for the family of five from Ghaziabad and Delhi. Flames tore through the club moments after they had stepped into Birch by Romeo Lane in Arpora late Saturday.Bhavana lived. The other four didn't. Her husband Vinod Kumar pushed her through the main entrance as panic broke loose, police said. She stumbled into the open, coughing, burning-eyed, alive. Then he turned back. Inside were Bhavana's three sisters, Anita, Saroj and Kamala, who had travelled with them for a short break that began on Dec 4. He went after them. Fire swallowed them all.Outside, Bhavana waited. She kept dialling Vinod's phone. It rang. Again and again. When the body was carried out, her phone was clenched in her hand, still calling out. The family of five had been staying at a hotel in Baga.What began as a leisure trip ended at a police barricade outside a blackened club, with hotel staff trying to comfort a woman who no longer had a family beside her.Relatives rushed to Goa through the night. ""Their children are waiting at home. All their relatives are waiting too,"" a family member said. ""We haven't told them that all four have died. We have only said two sisters are dead and the other two are missing. We want to take their bodies back."" Another relative held up a phone, trembling.""Look at this picture of my sister-in-law. She is completely charred. She has no skin left.""For Bhavana, the holiday ended in a circle of police tape and silence - saved by a man who walked back into fire so that others might live. Now only she remains to tell the children how their parents' last night together ended in minutes, and how love chose the flames.","Bhavana Joshi, her husband and three sisters were killed in a Goa nightclub fire.

150 years of Vande Mataram: Why BJP and Congress are fighting over its ‘missing stanzas’ — explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/150-years-of-vande-mataram-why-bjp-and-congress-are-fighting-over-its-missing-stanzasexplained-parliament-lok-sabha-debate/articleshow/125813886.cms,"Bankim Chandra Chatterjee (Image credit: PIB)

PM Modi Calls Vande Mataram A ‘Mantra Of Unity And Courage’ As The Song Completes 150 Years

Why it’s in the news now



Origins of Bande Mataram (1870s–1880s)



Song’s literary context: Anandamath

The Mother that was – glorious and mighty The Mother that is – suffering and oppressed The Mother that will be – restored to strength and glory

From song to slogan: Birth of a nationalist cry (1900–1910)



Swadeshi and anti-partition movement

Boycott movements Protest marches Newspapers and political groups carrying its name

Figures who popularised it included:

Rabindranath Tagore

Bipin Chandra Pal

Sri Aurobindo

British repression

Fines for students

Police lathi-charges

Bans on marches

Threats of expulsion from schools and colleges

The song and the Indian National Congress



1937 CWC decision: Were the stanzas removed?



Did it 'sow seeds of partition'?



What the 1937 CWC actually said

The first two stanzas had become widely used and carried no controversial imagery.

The remaining stanzas contained “allusions and a religious ideology” inconsistent with the beliefs of other religious groups.

Only the first two stanzas should be sung at national gatherings.

Organisers were free to choose additional songs if they wished.

Constituent assembly: Equal honour, equal status (1950)

Jana Gana Mana would be the national anthem.

Vande Mataram, because of its historic role, would be honoured equally and accorded equal status.

The debate today



Why is the BJP reviving the issue?

Why is the Congress defensive?

The 1937 decision was guided by inclusivity, not division.

The BJP is weaponising history to distract from contemporary governance failures.

Tagore and the freedom movement need protecting from political revisionism.

What Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind has to say



Vande Mataram

Parliament will begin a special discussion in the Lok Sabha on Monday to commemorate 150 years of Vande Mataram, a song that remains one of the most debated symbols of India’s freedom struggle.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will open the debate, with defence minister Rajnath Singh scheduled to conclude it. The BJP has been given three hours in the Lok Sabha, the total debate will span nearly ten hours. The Rajya Sabha will hold its discussion the next day, to be opened by Union home minister Amit Shah.The commemoration is not merely ceremonial. It arrives amid renewed political sparring over the song’s historical evolution, religious imagery, and the choices made by India’s pre-independence national leadership. What began as a patriotic hymn in a Bengali novel is once again a focal point of fierce political messaging, competing historical narratives, and questions about national identity.This explainer traces the 150-year journey of Vande Mataram—from its birth in Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay’s writing to its role in nationalism, the Congress’s 1937 decision to officially use only its first two stanzas, and its recognition in the Constituent Assembly as having “equal honour and status” with the National Anthem.The upcoming debate is part of a special parliamentary focus on the legacy of Vande Mataram. But the political temperature was raised last month, during the commemoration event of 150 years of the national song, when Prime Minister Modi accused the Congress of having “removed important stanzas” from the original song during its 1937 Faizabad session, claiming this decision “sowed the seeds of partition.”According to the Prime Minister, the Congress’s move amounted to breaking the national song into pieces—an act that abandoned its original spirit and undermined unity. He has framed the issue within his broader narrative of 'Viksit Bharat', tying cultural heritage to national development.The Congress hit back immediately. Citing The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi (Vol66, p46), the party argued that the 1937 decision was not an act of division, but a sensitive accommodation recommended by a Working Committee that included Mahatama Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, Subhas Chandra Bose, Rajendra Prasad, Abul Kalam Azad, Sarojini Naidu, and other iconic leaders. The CWC noted that the first two stanzas were already the only widely sung and nationally recognised part, while the remaining contained religious imagery that some citizens objected to.The Congress also emphasised that the decision drew from the advice of Rabindranath Tagore, who had himself sung Vande Mataram at the 1896 Congress session.In its rebuttal, the party accused the prime minister of attacking the legacy of India’s freedom movement while avoiding present-day issues such as unemployment, inequality, and foreign policy challenges.This political exchange has made the upcoming parliamentary debate all the more charged.The PIB’s historical account helps clarify the origins of the song. According to Sri Aurobindo’s writing in the English daily Bande Mataram (16 April 1907), Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay composed the song around 1875. It was published more widely when Bankim’s novel Anandamath began serialization in the Bengali magazine Bangadarshan in March–April 1881.Anandamath is built around a group of ascetic warriors, the Santanas, who dedicate themselves to freeing the motherland from oppression. Their devotion is entirely to Bharat Mata, envisioned not as a religious deity but as a personified motherland.In the temple of the Santanas stand three images of the Mother:For Aurobindo, the hymn embodied the essence of “the religion of patriotism.”Many later critics, however, would argue that the imagery—particularly in the later stanzas—draws from Hindu goddess symbolism that may not be inclusive of all communities.By the early 20th century, Vande Mataram had escaped its literary origins and become one of the most electrifying symbols of Indian nationalism.After Lord Curzon’s 1905 partition of Bengal, the song became the rallying cry for:In 1906, at Barisal, more than 10,000 Hindus and Muslims together marched shouting Vande Mataram—a testament to its early cross-communal appeal.Aurobindo’s writings in Bande Mataram (the newspaper) turned the phrase into a political and spiritual exhortation for self-rule.Alarmed by its galvanising effect, the colonial government tried repeatedly to suppress it through:From Bengal to Bombay Presidency, chanting Vande Mataram became synonymous with nationalist defiance.In 1907, Madam Bhikaji Cama unfurled the first tricolour abroad—in Stuttgart—with the words Vande Mataram emblazoned across it.The Congress adopted Vande Mataram not just culturally, but ceremonially.1896 —First Congress rendition: At the Calcutta session, Rabindranath Tagore sang the song, giving it national prominence.1905 — Nationwide adoption: At the Varanasi session, the Congress formally adopted Vande Mataram for all-India occasions. This was during the peak of the Swadeshi struggle, when the song had become the soundtrack of political awakening.Yes.By the 1930s, debates around the song’s religious imagery had become politically relevant. India’s nationalist leadership wanted to keep the movement inclusive, and Muslim leaders raised objections to certain stanzas that invoked Hindu goddesses.No.The CWC's decision was more inclusive than divisive in nature.The eventual decision to restrict Vande Mataram to its first two stanzas drew directly from this history of selective popular usage. As the Committee noted, only the opening verses — celebrating the land’s beauty and abundance in gentle, inclusive imagery — had organically acquired national significance over the decades.The remaining stanzas were scarcely known, rarely sung, and contained religious allusions and ideological references that many felt were inconsistent with the beliefs of other communities. The CWC explicitly acknowledged the “validity of the objections raised by Muslim friends” to those portions.While emphasising that the song’s modern, unifying role in national life mattered far more than its origins in a historical novel, the committee concluded that only the first two stanzas should be sung at national gatherings.This, they argued, preserved the unifying spirit the song had come to embody while avoiding elements that could alienate sections of India’s diverse society.The CWC’s statement, issued between October 26–November 1 in Kolkata, recorded:The committee explicitly said that the modern national use of the first two stanzas was more important than the song’s original placement in a religiously infused novel.Tagore had long argued that when a cultural symbol is used nationally, it must not exclude or alienate. His views shaped the committee’s decision and remain central to the Congress’s defence today.When the Constituent Assembly met to choose India’s national symbols, there was no dispute between Jana Gana Mana and Vande Mataram.In his statement on January 24, 1950, DrRajendra Prasad, President of the Assembly, declared:There was applause; no member raised objections.This dual recognition was meant to preserve both inclusivity and historical memory: the anthem would represent national unity, while Vande Mataram’s legacy would be canonised as part of India’s freedom story.For the ruling party, Vande Mataram is a civilizational invocation that predates partisan politics. The BJP frames the 1937 Congress decision as overly accommodative, even compromising, and often ties this critique to a larger argument about “appeasement.”In the government’s view, celebrating 150 years of the song is part of a project to reaffirm cultural pride and national self-confidence.The Congress insists it is the party that first elevated the song, sang it at historic moments, and fought the British under its banner. It argues that:The Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, led by Maulana Mahmood Madani, has taken a clear and consistent position on thedebate: it accepts the first two stanzas as historically validated for national use but firmly rejects the remaining verses on theological grounds.Madani argued that the full composition contains imagery — particularly the depiction of the motherland as the goddess Durga — that conflicts with Islamic monotheism, making it impermissible for Muslims to recite.""He stated that Vande Mataram in its complete form is rooted in shirkiya aqaaid (polytheistic beliefs). Particularly, in the remaining four stanzas, the motherland is depicted as the goddess Durga and addressed with words of worship — concepts that clearly conflict with the Islamic belief in the oneness of God. 'Muslims believe in one God and worship Him alone,' Maulana Madani said. 'Therefore, singing verses that ascribe divinity to anyone other than Allah goes against our faith and conscience,'"" a statement by Jamiat said.","Parliament will begin a special discussion in the Lok Sabha on Monday to commemorate 150 years of Vande Mataram. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will open the debate, with defence minister Rajnath Singh scheduled to conclude it. It arrives amid renewed political sparring over the song’s historical evolution. What began as a patriotic hymn in a Bengali novel is a focal point of fierce political messaging.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125815916,imgsize-732549,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

NEW DELHI: At least 25 people were killed and six others injured after a massive fire broke out shortly after midnight on Sunday at the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, North Goa. Police initially confirmed 23 deaths but later revised the toll to 25.A police spokesperson said the deceased included four tourists and 14 staff members, while the identities of seven others are yet to be established. Six injured persons are undergoing treatment at Goa Medical College and Hospital in Bambolim.According to eyewitnesses, the nightclub was jam-packed with around 100 people on the dance floor when the fire broke out shortly after midnight on Sunday. In the panic that followed, many rushed downstairs and ended up in the kitchen on the ground floor, where they were trapped along with staff members.State police said the blaze was triggered by a cylinder blast, but some eyewitnesses claimed the fire started on the first floor, where tourists were dancing.Most of those who died were kitchen workers, including three women, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said. He added that ""three to four tourists"" were among the victims.""There was a sudden commotion as the flames started erupting. We rushed out of the club only to see that the entire structure was up in flames,"" Fatima Shaikh, a tourist from Hyderabad told PTI.She said some tourists, in the confusion, ran to the kitchen area and got trapped, while ""many managed to run out of the club.""The fire spread rapidly because the club had temporary construction made up of palm leaves, which caught fire instantly. The venue, located in the backwaters of the Arpora river, had narrow entry and exit routes, making evacuation and rescue difficult. Fire brigades could not reach the club due to the lanes and had to park about 400 metres away.According to PTI senior fire and emergency services officer said the narrow access ""made controlling the blaze a challenging task.""The nightclub's location in the backwaters of the Arpora river, with a narrow approach road, made rescue difficult. Fire tenders could not reach the club because of the lanes, forcing crews to park nearly 400 metres away.A Fire and Emergency Services official said the narrow access ""made controlling the blaze a challenging task.""Goa CM Pramod Sawant said that managers of the club and others have already been arrested, and an arrest warrant has been issued against the owners.""This is an unfortunate day. For the first time in Goa’s tourism history, such a big incident of fire has occurred. 25 people died. I reached the spot at 1.30–2 am… Fire was doused within half an hour, but some people could rush out of it, and some others could not,"" Sawant told ANI.He confirmed several victims died of suffocation, and said, ""As per preliminary information, four people were tourists, and the rest were employees at the club.

PM Modi Calls Vande Mataram A ‘Mantra Of Unity And Courage’ As The Song Completes 150 Years

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi will initiate a discussion on Monday in Lok Sabha on the 150th anniversary of Vande Mataram, in what will be an extension of the increasingly fiery ideological battle between BJP and its opponents over the journey of India's national song, a rallying cry during the Congress-led freedom struggle, but whose evocative cultural theme is central to the governing party's political idiom.Defence minister Rajnath Singh from BJP and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Gaurav Gogoi of Congress will be speaking on the issue, which has long animated BJP's base steeped in cultural nationalism.Ten hours each have been assigned for the debate in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, where it is scheduled for Tuesday and home minister Amit Shah will be BJP's main speaker.Sparks seemed set to fly, with BJP sources saying many important and unknown facets related to Vande Mataram will be brought before the nation during the discussion, signalling the party's determined bid to put Congress in a dock over the patriotic song, which is interwoven with India's freedom struggle.Congress has, on the other hand, cited Rabindranath Tagore's support for pruning of the immortal composition to two stanzas to defend Jawaharlal Nehru who accepted it because of both difficulty in understanding the stanzas following the first two, and objections of Muslims.Modi had recently set the tone of the discussion by accusing Congress of dropping in 1937 the stanzas of the song written by noted Bengali writer Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, saying it sowed the seeds of Partition and that such a divisive mindset remains a challenge to the country.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra claimed Sunday Nehru's ""reality"" will be exposed during the debate. He also cited historical text to train guns at Nehru, noting the first PM had contended that Vande Mataram's association with Anandmath, a novel written by Chatterjee, is likely to""irritate"" Muslims and that he found the song's language difficult to understand.Chatterjee's association with the song and its strong endorsement by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose will come handy for BJP in its bid to put TMC on the defensive on the issue of Bengali identity as it prepares for the assembly polls in West Bengal, slated to be held next year.Congress and other BJP rivals like TMC and Samajwadi Party may turn to the alleged indifference of BJP's ideological mentor RSS to the freedom struggle, besides the stand of Hindutva figures on some of the symbols of Indian nationalism at that time to target the government.Muslim League's strident opposition to Vande Mataram because of its evocative Hindu cultural themes, including reverential reference to deities, had led to the song's adoption to its first two paras by Congress, the trigger behind Modi's recent attack on the party. The opposition party, however, argued it was done on Tagore's suggestions. Several orthodox Muslim bodies and politicians have, however, remained critical of the song.The debate will be followed by a discussion in both Houses on ""election reforms"", a broader term to cover what will be essentially a war of words between the government and opposition parties over the SIR of electoral rolls.",PM Narendra Modi will initiate a discussion in Lok Sabha on the 150th anniversary of Vande Mataram.

Goa: 23 Killed In Arpora Nightclub Fire; Cylinder Blast Suspected, CM Sawant Vows Strict Action

North Goa nightclub tragedy

NEW DELHI: The fire at a nightclub in Goa, which killed 25 people, started after fireworks were set off inside, eyewitnesses said.Riya, a tourist from Delhi who managed to escape in time, recalled seeing firecrackers bursting around the dance floor. “The fire must have been caused due to this. There was a stampede-like situation,” she told news agency PTI.Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant later confirmed it, saying, “According to the preliminary inquiry, the fire broke out due to the bursting of some electrical firecrackers inside the club.”As the injured continue to be treated in the hospital and the investigation moves forward, people who were inside or nearby are sharing the horror they witnessed.Fatima Shaikh from Hyderabad said the club was packed because it was the weekend. She remembered a sudden wave of panic.“There was a sudden commotion as the flames started erupting. We rushed out of the club only to see that the entire structure was up in flames,” she said.Fatima said many people rushed downstairs, not knowing it led to the kitchen, where some got trapped with the staff.""It was a temporary structure made of palm leaves, so it easily caught fire,"" she added.A security guard at a nearby restaurant told reporters that the first thing he heard was a “massive explosion”. He later learnt that many people believed it began with a cylinder blast.Another visitor from Delhi, Nikhnesh, said he reached the area just as smoke began rising. “We were planning to come and party here last night. As soon as we reached our hostel, we saw plumes of smoke rising.”A guard named Sanjay Kumar Gupta said everything happened within minutes. ""Suddenly, there was a fire. I was at the gate. A DJ and dancer were going to perform, and it was about to get really crowded,” he said.Witnesses also told news agency IANS that people in nearby hotels saw flames rising from a distance while police tried to control the crowd.A tourist said they saw “reddish flames”. ""We had just reached our hotel when we noticed reddish flames coming out. When we went to check, the police were already there managing the situation.""One resident from the neighbourhood said they heard ambulance sirens at midnight but only learnt the scale of the tragedy the next morning.""It happened at midnight, so not much was known at the time. I heard the sound of an ambulance. In the morning, I found out that perhaps 23 people had died,"" the person said.Others spoke about how close they came to being inside.

Ceasefire collapses amid renewed clashes and diplomatic fallout



Long-running border dispute







Thailand carried out airstrikes on Cambodian military positions on Monday, signalling a sharp escalation in a border conflict that had already appeared close to unravelling after Bangkok halted progress on a US-backed ceasefire agreement.The Thai army said the strikes were launched in response to Cambodian artillery and mortar fire that killed one Thai soldier and injured two others earlier in the morning. Major General Winthai Suvaree said the operation targeted “arms-supporting positions” near the Chong An Ma Pass, accusing Cambodian units of repeatedly shelling Thai territory.Cambodia rejected that account, accusing Thai forces of carrying out the first attack at around 5 a.m. and of engaging in “numerous provocative actions for many days”. Both sides reported heavy exchanges along the frontier, and Thailand said about 70% of civilians in border towns had already been evacuated.The violence marks the most serious breach of the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords, signed in late October and witnessed by US President Donald Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. That agreement followed a brutal five-day conflict in July that killed dozens and displaced hundreds of thousands.Yet tensions resumed almost immediately after Thailand suspended implementation of the deal last month, blaming a landmine blast that wounded several Thai soldiers on what it claimed were newly planted Cambodian explosives.Fresh incidents have followed. A Thai soldier lost a foot after a landmine explosion last week, prompting Bangkok to publicly accuse Cambodia of reigniting hostilities. A Cambodian civilian was later reported killed in new exchanges near Prey Chan village, with both governments trading accusations of deliberate escalation.Analysts say the ceasefire was always fragile. Experts from Singapore and Bangkok note that the deal failed to address the core territorial dispute dating back more than a century. Without a clear demarcation, both sides continue to interpret border lines differently — particularly around the contested ancient temple complexes that have long fuelled nationalist sentiment.Skirmishes have now spread across multiple flashpoints, including areas near Surin, Sa Kaeo, Oddar Meanchey and long-contentious temple zones. Both sides allege the use of heavy weaponry, while Thailand has accused Cambodia of firing BM-21 rockets into civilian districts and targeting a hospital — claims Phnom Penh denies. Diplomatic ties have sharply deteriorated, with each side expelling ambassadors in recent weeks.","Thailand carried out airstrikes on Cambodian military positions on Monday, signalling a sharp escalation in a border conflict.

US President Donald Trump is a little disappointed with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy , as he didn't read the proposal to end the war with Russia, while Vladimir Putin accepted it.While talking with the reporters at the red carpet of the Kennedy Center Honors, Trump said Ukraine loved the proposal, but Zelenskyy is not ready.""We have been speaking to President Putin and Ukrainian leaders, including President Zelenskyy. I am a little disappointed that President Zelenskyy hasn't read the proposal yet...Russia's fine with it (proposal)...But I am not sure that Zelenskyy is fine with it. His people love it. But he is not ready..."" Trump said.The remarks came as talks between US and Ukrainian negotiators over a proposed peace deal with Russia ended in Miami this weekend, with few new developments and lingering questions over security guarantees and territorial issues, according to Ukrainian officials.As the talks concluded, the Kremlin welcomed US President Donald Trump’s new security strategy, saying it dropped the language of past US administrations describing Russia as a threat.The marathon Miami meeting began on Thursday between US special envoy Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Ukrainian officials Rustem Umerov and Andriy Hnatov.After three days of talks, “difficult issues remain,” Ukrainian Ambassador to the US Olga Stefanishyna said Saturday, “but both sides continue working to shape realistic and acceptable solutions.”She added, “The main challenges at this stage concern questions of territory and guarantees, and we are actively seeking optimal formats for addressing them. More details will be provided once all information is compiled. ”Territory and security guarantees are long-standing sticking points for any possible deal. Ukraine maintains that a just end to the war would include reliable security guarantees and would not force it to surrender more territory to Russia.As the meetings kicked off earlier this week, President Vladimir Putin told reporters in India that his country intended to seize Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region by any means.The Miami talks were preceded by a visit to Moscow by US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. Trump said Wednesday the US delegation had a “very good meeting” with Putin, and that they believed the Russian President “would like to see the war ended” — though the talks failed to yield a breakthrough.In a social media post on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he had a “long” and “constructive” phone conversation with Witkoff and Kushner, as well as his Ukrainian delegation in Miami. “We covered many aspects and went through key points that could ensure an end to the bloodshed and eliminate the threat of a new Russian full-scale invasion,” Zelenskyy said. “We agreed on the next steps and formats for talks with the United States. ” He also noted “the risk of Russia failing to honour its promises, as has happened repeatedly in the past.”Zelenskyy said that Hnatov and Umerov were expected to deliver him a “detailed in person report” on the negotiations. “Not everything can be discussed over the phone,” Zelenskyy said. “So we need to work closely with our teams on ideas and proposals.”Peace and its conditions will also be the subject of a meeting on Monday between Zelenskyy and French, British and German leaders in London. The discussion will cover “the situation and the ongoing negotiations within the framework of the American mediation,” French President Emmanuel Macron said Saturday.","US President Donald Trump is a little disappointed with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as he didn't read the proposal to end the war with Russia.

'You have to send Usha back to India': Row erupts over JD Vance saying mass migration is 'theft of the American Dream',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/you-have-to-send-usha-back-to-india-row-erupts-over-jd-vance-saying-mass-migration-is-theft-of-the-american-dream/articleshow/125821737.cms,"Americans Train To ‘FIGHT’ Trump’s Troops, ICE Raids In New York | ‘PROTECTION FROM NATIONAL GUARD’





An immigration row erupted after US vice president JD Vance declared that mass migration amounts to “theft of the American Dream.""This comment again triggered an ongoing row regarding JD's Hindu-Indian wife, Usha. Social media accused the second-highest MAGA leader of hypocrisy because his own wife was born to immigrants.Vance posted on X that “mass migration is theft of the American Dream”, adding that studies suggesting otherwise were funded by “the people getting rich off of the old system”.JD's comments follow earlier remarks made during an appearance on the New York Post’s podcast, where he said that it was “totally reasonable and acceptable” for Americans to not want neighbours with whom they shared nothing in common, including race, language or skin colour.Vance, like his boss, Donald Trump, blames the Biden administration for an immigration system that “promoted division” in US.The vice president was asked whether the Trump administration planned to deport all illegal migrants. Vance replied, “We’re trying to remove as many as we possibly can.”Vance has repeatedly argued that migrants are damaging the prospects of American workers. Speaking at a Turning Point USA event in Mississippi last week, he said immigrants were “undercutting the wages of American workers” while defending Donald Trump’s H-1B visa reforms.Last month, JD Vance strirred another row after saying he hoped his wife, Usha, who was born into a Hindu family, might one day convert to Christianity.

Trump against birthright citizenship





US Homeland Security Adviser Stephen Miller weighed in on birthright citizenship with a fiery tone.The Trump loyalist called the constitutional guarantee an “atrocity” as the US Supreme Court prepares to hear the White House’s appeal on restricting automatic citizenship.Miller posted on X, saying that current rules allow people with no legal statusin America to gain access to welfare and political influence through their US-born children. “Of all the destructive and ruinous policies aimed at the heart of our Republic, few can compete with ‘birthright citizenship,” he said.He claimed that “every illegal alien, foreign visitor and visa scammer, merely by giving birth on US soil, can access unlimited welfare for life through their ‘American’ child and send the extra cash back home to support their foreign village”.Miller said that such children become voters at 18, which he said makes up for a large voting base in the US: “Illegal aliens and their descendants are one of the largest voting blocs in the United States”.Miller also raised security concerns: “Under ‘birthright citizenship,’ a terrorist and his terrorist wife can commit immigration fraud, come here as tourists, perpetrate a terrorist attack, give birth, and have an ‘American’ child.”Miller's remarks arrive as the Supreme Court has agreed to take up Trump’s appeal to uphold his January 20 executive order seeking to limit birthright citizenship. The order aims to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the United States if their mother has temporary lawful status or no legal status, and if the father is not a US citizen or permanent resident. Four lower courts have blocked the government from enforcing the directive, leaving the policy on hold.Immigration experts warn that restricting citizenship would hit families caught in the decades-long green card backlog, particularly thousands of Indian workers on H-1B and H-4 visas. Under the proposed order, a baby born to such parents after February 19, 2025, would no longer receive US citizenship and would instead inherit the mother’s temporary status. In cases where the mother has no lawful status, the child could be considered unlawfully present from birth.",Homeland Security Adviser Stephen Miller called the constitutional guarantee an ‘atrocity’ as the US Supreme Court prepares to hear the White House’s appeal on restricting automatic citizenship.

Netflix–Warner Bros deal: Trump concerned over OTT giant's ‘large market share’; asserts he will be ‘involved’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/netflixwarner-bros-deal-trump-concerned-over-ott-giants-large-market-share-asserts-he-will-be-involved/articleshow/125824450.cms,"Netflix Drops A $72b Bombshell On Hollywood With Mega Warner Bros Discovery Move | WHAT IT MEANS

US President Donald Trump on Sunday raised concerns about the recent Hollywood deal that shook up the media landscape, Netflix acquisition of Warner Bros. The US president, speaking to the media while arriving for the Kennedy Center Honors awards ceremony on Sunday, said that the proposed multi-billion-dollar acquisition raised concerns about market dominance.The streaming service, he argued, already commands significant power in the sector. Netflix has “a very large market share” and “it could be a problem.” He further hinted that the White House would be tied to deal, “I’ll be involved in that decision.”These remarks come as federal authorities weigh whether the nearly $83 billion deal should be allowed to proceed amid pushback from within Hollywood, where the prospect of further consolidation has triggered antitrust concerns.Despite the caution, Trump offered warm words for Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, who met him at the White House recently, saying “he's done one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.”The takeover would hand Netflix control of HBO Max in addition to Warner Bros. studios, the home of titles ranging from “Casablanca” and “Citizen Kane” to recent box-office juggernaut “Barbie.”In case the agreement stands as proposed, the streaming platform would also take possession of world-famous franchises including Harry Potter, the Lord of the Rings saga and DC Studios’ superheroes: Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman among them.However, the deal excludes Warner Bros.’ linear television channels. Discovery, CNN and other broadcast properties would be separated from the company before any sale is finalised.Warner Bros. Discovery announced in October that it was open to a sale after fielding multiple unsought bids. Netflix emerged ahead of rival interest from Comcast and from Paramount Skydance, the media business led by David Ellison, a figure known to be a major supporter of Trump.","US President Donald Trump raised concerns about the recent Hollywood deal that shook up the media landscape, Netflix acquisition of Warner Bros.

KOCHI: The Ernakulam principal sessions court will pronounce the verdict in the sensational actor abduction and rape case, in which actor Dileep is accused of conspiring and hiring a gang to execute the crime, on Monday.District and sessions judge Honey M Varghese will deliver the judgment against 10 accused, excluding those who were discharged or turned approver during the trial. Sunil N S alias Pulsar Suni, who led the gang that abducted and raped the actor, is the prime accused.Besides Suni and Dileep, the accused include Martin Antony, Manikandan B, Vijeesh V P, Salim H alias Vadival Salim, Pradeep, Charly Thomas, Sanilkumar alias Mesthiri Sanil, and G Sarath. The offences include those under Sections 120(A), 120(B) (criminal conspiracy), 109 (abetment of crime), 342, 357 (wrongful confinement), 366 (kidnapping), 354 (outraging a woman's modesty), 354(B) (intent to disrobe a woman), 376(D) (gang rape), 506(i) (criminal intimidation), 201 (destroying evidence), 212 (harbouring an offender), and 34 (common intention) of the IPC.The popular actor was abducted and assaulted in Kochi on Feb 17, 2017, when she was travelling from Thrissur to Kochi.The prosecution's case is that the gang hijacked the survivor's vehicle. Martin Antony was entrusted with picking up the survivor from her house, and he informed Suni of her location throughout the journey. Suni and others started following the vehicle from Angamaly and faked an accident at Athani at 9.15pm. The accused then entered the vehicle and wrongfully confined her. Suni threatened the survivor, sexually assaulted her and recorded obscene videos, including the visuals of the sexual assault, on a mobile phone.In Nov 2022, police relied on circumstantial evidence to submit a second chargesheet that actor Dileep conspired with Suni. It was alleged that Dileep nursed a grudge towards the survivor for informing his former wife, actor Manju Warrier, about his extramarital affair.The trial in the case began on March 8, 2018. Over the years, it saw 261 witnesses, including prominent film actors, being examined in camera, with 28 of them turning hostile. Two prosecutors resigned over the years, and the survivor unsuccessfully moved higher courts seeking to change the presiding officer. Ultimately, the prosecution submitted 833 documents and 142 pieces of evidence, while the defence submitted 221 documents.

BENGALURU: The chaos at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) may have eased Friday night, but for hundreds of stranded passengers, the ordeal continued. Even as IndiGo continued to cancel flights, passengers spent up to 10 agonising hours sifting through piles of abandoned baggage — some damaged, some missing — as assurances of refunds did little to alleviate the stress caused by a system that collapsed without warning.Dhanya Ravindhran, whose flight was cancelled, waited over eight hours for her baggage and camera gear needed for a shoot. ""I kept asking the IndiGo staff, but they had no idea how to retrieve it. They simply said, ‘Madam, please wait' for hours,"" she said. ""Finally, with the help of an airport staff member, I found a small opening near the conveyor tunnel and pulled out my luggage myself. There were heaps of bags dumped there — easily over 1,000,"" she told TOI.Similarly, Arif Khan, a software engineer travelling to Jaipur, found his suitcase damaged after a seven-hour wait. ""My bag looked like it had been thrown around. The wheels were broken, and no staff member could explain what happened...This is the worst situation for IndiGo in the history of its operations.""For 24-year-old student Anjana Ram, the long wait escalated into panic. ""I had medications in my checked-in bag.I waited almost nine hours and pleaded with the staff to prioritise it, but they said they weren't able to track individual bags,"" she said. When her luggage finally arrived, the zipper had been split open. ""Things were falling out. It was heartbreaking.""UK-bound traveller Prakash Menon described the scene as ""an ocean of abandoned bags"". He added, ""People were climbing over piles to find their luggage. There was no system, no announcements, no queue management. It was unbelievable for an international airport of this scale.""Even as crowds diminished by evening, travellers said the airport must urgently improve baggage retrieval procedures to prevent a repeat of this week-long disruption. ""Refunds don't fix the mental stress or the damaged luggage,"" Menon said. ""The system clearly wasn't prepared for a crisis of this magnitude.""Singer takes ordeal to social mediaFor Bengaluru-based singer Ananya Prakash, what should have been a short flight to Hyderabad turned into an ordeal she will never forget. Her flight was abruptly cancelled, leaving her and hundreds of others stranded with no clarity. ""The airlines are least bothered about passengers,"" she said, standing amid a sea of confused travellers. ""People have been waiting for hours. There's no space to even sit.""Her checked-in baggage only added to the distress. At first, airline staff told her the bags would be delayed. Then the message changed: it could take two days to get them back.""I had all my work equipment in that bag,"" she said.

ARPORA: A massive fire at the popular Arpora nightclub Birch in North Goa late Saturday killed 25 people, including five tourists, and injured six. Flames erupted around 11.45pm during a belly-dance performance and engulfed the first-floor dance floor within seconds.Around 150 people were in the DJ area when the blaze broke out, with the dancer performing to Mehbooba O Mehbooba when the fire was first noticed.Electric firecrackers are believed to have struck the wooden ceiling, igniting the blaze. Smoke quickly filled the building, triggering panic. Some guests fled downstairs to the basement kitchen, where 23 victims suffocated. Two charred bodies were later found on the staircase.The deceased included 20 staffers from Assam, Bengal, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Nepal, alongside five tourists. The club, located on a salt pan and surrounded by water, had only a narrow access lane, which trapped revellers and delayed rescue efforts. Investigations revealed the nightclub was operating without proper licences and flouted fire safety norms. Three state government officials have been suspended.Chief minister Pramod Sawant said the chief secretary and DGP Alok Kumar would initiate disciplinary action against the suspended officials. He dismissed initial speculation of a cylinder blast, noting that police and fire service investigations pointed to electric firecrackers as the cause. “The fire spread quickly because of the wooden ceiling,” he said.Postmortems on 17 bodies were completed by Saturday evening, and five were handed over to families. Following the inquiry, the state government sealed Romeo Lane at Vagator, another club owned by the same proprietors, citing inadequate fire safety measures.Police arrested four club staffers—chief general manager Rajiv Modak, gate manager Priyanshu Thakur, bar manager Rajveer Singhania, and general manager Vivek Singh. An FIR has been registered against Delhi-based owners Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. A police team is in Delhi to serve arrest warrants.Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced Rs 2 lakh ex gratia for the next of kin of each deceased and Rs 50,000 for the injured. CM Sawant separately declared Rs 5 lakh for each death and Rs 50,000 to the injured.DGP Alok Kumar said the fire spread rapidly from the first-floor ceiling, trapping guests in the basement.

‘Rs 500cr suitcase makes a CM’: Navjot Singh Sidhu wife’s claim sparks firestorm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/rs-500cr-suitcase-makes-a-cm-navjot-singh-sidhu-wifes-claim-sparks-firestorm/articleshow/125820702.cms,"Chandigarh: Former Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu 's wife, Navjot Kaur Sidhu , has stirred a controversy by claiming that only a politician who gives Rs 500 crore in a suitcase becomes the chief minister in Punjab — an apparent dig at alleged corruption in her party.Navjot Kaur's remark came on Saturday evening, when she was speaking to media after meeting Punjab governor Gulab Chand Kataria on deteriorating law and order in the state. She claimed that her husband could bring a turnaround in Punjab if any party empowered him, but they did not have the money to give donations to any party. When asked by a journalist why did she mention the money, she responded, ""Nahi. Hamse kisi ne nahi ki demand, par CM wahi banta hai jo 500 crore da attache deta hai (No one asked us for money, but only a person who gives a suitcase full of Rs 500 crore becomes the CM). ""Reacting to the remarks, Congress MP and former Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa on Sunday mentioned the Congress made Sidhu a minister and state president. ""I want to ask how much money did he give and to whom for that? The status of party president is higher than that of the CM. Levelling such allegations when you have served as party president is anti-party. The high command should look into it,"" he said.Randhawa added the Sidhus hadn't been active for four years, but started levelling allegations when elections were near. ""They have always betrayed the party. He (Sidhu) refused to make an address during a party rally attended by Priyanka Gandhi in Dhuri [in the run-up to 2022 Punjab elections after Channi was announced as CM candidate by the Congress],"" he added.On Saturday, Navjot Kaur also blamed infighting with Punjab Congress for her husband staying away. ""Vo Congress ke saath attached hain, bahut zyada Priyanka ji ke saath attachment hai. Par mujhe itni infighting mein lag nahi raha ki kahin bhi Navjot Sidhu ko ye promote hone denge. Kyonki paanch-paanch CM already bane hue hai aur vo haraane pe lage hue hain Congress ko. Aur agar unko samajh aa jaye to baat doosri hai (He is attached to the Congress, and deeply to Priyanka. But, given the scale of infighting in Punjab Congress, I don't feel they will let Navjot Sidhu be promoted. Because, there are five CMs (read aspirants) already and they are bent upon defeating the Congress. It is another matter if the high command understands),"" she said.Randhawa asked Navjot Kaur if this meant that each of these five CM aspirants would give the party Rs 2,500 crore.AAP slams congThe incumbent Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) also latched onto the statement to criticise Congress. Punjab AAP spokesperson and former minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal, while speaking to the media in Amritsar and referring to Navjot Kaur's remarks, said it exposed the ""internal reality of Congress"". ""Five people are roaming around Punjab claiming to be chief ministerial faces of Congress. This is the reason the party has been ruined,"" he said.In Chandigarh, AAP Punjab general secretary and media in-charge Baltej Pannu said the statement had ""exposed the ugly truth of how Congress functions, how leadership is decided, and how Punjab's interests are sidelined for personal ambitions and monetary deals"". ""Navjot Kaur Sidhu made two explosive claims, Navjot Sidhu will re-enter Punjab politics only if Congress first declares him as the CM face and the Sidhus do not have Rs 500 crore to play, implying that becoming CM in Punjab requires a Rs 500 crore deal,"" he said.Pannu called the remarks ""deeply disturbing"".""Does the Congress actually sell the CM face for Rs 500 crore? If Sidhus claim they don't have Rs 500 crore, who pays this amount? Where does this money go? To the state unit president? To high command? To Rahul Gandhi or Kharge? The people of Punjab deserve answers,"" he said.Dacoits sitting in party: JakharPunjab BJP president Sunil Jakhar, who preceded Sidhu as Punjab Congress president, said, ""I heard from the horse's mouth, or you may say son of the horse, who said they got the chief ministership for Rs 350 crore. See where the Congress has reached.""Asserting that he did not have the audio proof of the Rs 350-crore claim and that ""Madam Sidhu may have one for Rs 500 crore"", Jakhar said he did have a ""tweet"" of a Congress leader where he said ""dacoits have been made to sit in Congress"". ""Those dacoits are still there. The dacoits I am talking about are still holding positions of power in Congress. Those who take the test that such a person cannot become the chief minister of Punjab, that biba ji (woman) is still sitting there. Those who took 300 or 500 (cr) or whatever are still sitting there,"" he said.","Navjot Kaur Sidhu's remark came on Saturday evening, when she was speaking to media after meeting Punjab governor Gulab Chand Kataria.

CCTV footage, retrieved by police, shows the victim seated at the counter when a man wearing a monkey cap enters, throws red chilli powder in his face, then climbs onto the counter and stabs him more than 10 times. The assailant was caught by local residents after a brief chase, about 30 metres from the shop, and later detained by police.The incident occurred shortly after 8.30 am, when the victim, Girdhari Lal, had opened his shop, Girdhari Lal & Sons Jewellery, on the ground floor of his residence. Locals said Lal, a long-time resident of Govindpuri colony, typically opened his store earlier than others in the area, a routine the assailant, Ankit Gupta, allegedly knew.A bike taxi rider living in the same area until his family relocated a month ago, Gupta was allegedly under financial stress after losing around Rs 20 lakh in shares and online gaming, police said. He knew that Lal owned three other jewellery shops and was well off. For a week, he recced Lal's Govindpuri shop and timed his attack to coincide with the early opening hours to take advantage of the lack of customers and other shopkeepers in the vicinity, police said.On Thursday, the accused entered the shop just after Lal began his day. He threw a fistful of red chilli powder into Lal's face. And even before Lal could react, Gupta climbed onto the shop's counter and slashed and stabbed him repeatedly with a knife, leaving him dead within seconds.Lal's son, Rupendra Soni, heard his father's screams and rushed into the shop, and tried to restrain the attacker. Soni hurled the assailant on a bench, but Soni pulled out what appeared to be a gun—a later investigation revealed it was a toy—and managed to give him a slip.As Soni chased him, local shopkeepers, responding to the commotion, captured the assailant roughly 25-30 metres from the shop. He was beaten by the crowd before being handed over to the police.The entire assault that lasted fewer than 60 seconds was captured in a CCTV camera installed in the shop. Police said they were analysing CCTV footage and gathering witness accounts to reconstruct the events in full.ACP Modinagar Amit Saxena said preliminary investigations indicated that Gupta targeted Lal's shop with the intention to steal jewellery. ""He had planned the robbery around a week in advance. After attacking Lal, he had planned to grab the jewellery on display in a bag that he was carrying. It seems he hadn't anticipated that Soni or anyone would arrive so quickly,"" the officer said, adding that a toy gun had been recovered from Gupta.DCP (Rural) Surendra Nath Tiwari said Gupta has been detained and is being questioned. While no FIR was lodged till the filing of the report, police said the process of registering one was on.Police said the accused had bought the knife online and received it only on Wednesday. In the five days leading up to the crime, Gupta allegedly watched more than 25 heist videos on YouTube to prepare for the robbery, cops added. He also claimed to own a YouTube channel, Desire Telefilms, that has 6,25,000 subscribers.The attack sparked outrage among local residents and shopkeepers, many of whom shut down shops in protest, accusing the police of failing to maintain law and order. Sudheer Singh, a local shopkeeper, said, ""The police chowki is just 200m away, yet patrolling is rare. A robbery attempt at Lal's shop happened two years ago, and the culprits were never caught. Even recent thefts in nearby shops are unresolved.""DCP Tiwari assured the community that additional police forces had been deployed and that security measures in the area would be reviewed. He confirmed that a dedicated team would remain stationed in the market to prevent future incidents and increase patrolling in the area.","A 75-year-old jewellery shop owner was stabbed to death on Thursday morning during a robbery in Govindpuri.

A science teacher at Donna Klein Jewish Academy in Boca Raton, Palm Beach County, Florida, was arrested after investigators said he used a shared Google Doc to communicate secretly with a student before engaging in sexual acts with her at the school and in his flat, according to an arrest affidavit.Elias Gordon Farley, 26, was taken into custody after the student reported the alleged abuse on November 18, Fox News reported.Farley is charged with unlawful sexual activity with a minor and offence against a student by an authority figure. He was booked into the Palm Beach County Main Detention Centre on Dec. 4 and is being held on a $500,000 bond.According to the affidavit, the student told detectives the interactions began as casual conversations during the previous school year but that over the summer Farley created a shared Google Doc in which they exchanged messages. Investigators said the file later contained explicit entries describing sexual activity and planning when they would meet privately.The student said the relationship became physical in mid-September inside Farley’s office, where he touched her beneath her clothing. She told detectives the encounters continued for weeks in both his office and a classroom. By late September and into October, she said the pair engaged in sexual acts, including oral sex and intercourse inside a classroom on campus.She also described visiting Farley’s flat twice in early November after recognising details he had mentioned about its location and layout. Deputies said several sexual encounters occurred during those visits.Detectives executed a search warrant and found bedding, condom wrappers and furniture matching the student’s description. Farley’s flatmate confirmed he had not been home on the dates the student said she visited. School surveillance video reviewed by deputies showed Farley and the student entering his office together on Nov. 7 and later entering a classroom for about an hour.The situation came to light after the student confided in an art teacher on Nov. 14 and showed bruises and bite marks she said were inflicted by Farley. Administrators were informed the next day, suspended Farley immediately and reported the matter to child welfare authorities.Farley refused to speak with detectives after being read his Miranda rights, according to the affidavit.In a statement provided to Fox News Digital, Donna Klein Jewish Academy said it is cooperating fully with the investigation and called the situation “a difficult time for all of us at Donna Klein.”“We are approaching this serious situation with the utmost care, keeping the well-being of our students, faculty and families at the forefront,” a spokesperson said. The spokesperson said no additional details would be released “out of respect for the privacy of our community” but that Farley is no longer employed at the school.","Elias Gordon Farley, 26, was taken into custody after the student reported the alleged abuse on November 18.

Crowd Grooving To ‘Mehbooba’ As Flames Engulf Goa Nightclub, Video Goes Viral

Owner still absconding

Saurabh Luthra

NEW DELHI: Police on Monday detained another manager linked to the tragic Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub fire in Goa that claimed 25 lives.The accused was identified as Bharat. According to police, he used to run daily operation of Birch by Romeo Lane at the club.The owner of Birch by Romeo Lane, Saurabh Luthra, remains absconding following the devastating fire at his Arpora nightclub on Saturday night, which claimed 25 lives and injured six others.Until last year, Luthra had aimed to launch 50 restaurants across India, but his weekend property turned into the site of one of Goa’s worst nightlife tragedies.Luthra’s LinkedIn profile lists him as ‘Chairman at Romeo Lane, Birch and Mama’s Buoi’. Activist Tahir Noronha described him as “like a ghost,” saying he rarely stays in Goa and often avoids legal proceedings, sending representatives in his place.“He is out of touch with the impact of his ventures,” Noronha said. Socialites and staff also described him as aloof; Jayesh Diukar, a kitchen staffer who survived the fire, said Luthra visited the club only once a month and rarely interacted with employees.At least 100-200 persons were on the dance floor of a nightclub in North Goa when a fire broke out there, and in an attempt to escape, some of them ran downstairs to its kitchen where they got trapped along with the staff.While the state police said the blaze occurred at the nightclub due to a cylinder blast after midnight on Sunday, some of the eyewitnesses claimed the fire started on the club's first floor, where tourists were dancing.Most of the dead were the club's kitchen workers, and included three women, chief minister Pramod Sawant said. There were “three to four tourists” among those killed, he added.""There was a sudden commotion as the flames started erupting. We rushed out of the club only to see that the entire structure was up in flames,"" Fatima Shaikh, a tourist from Hyderabad, told PTI at Arpora in the wee hours of Sunday.","The owner of Birch by Romeo Lane, Saurabh Luthra, remains absconding following the devastating fire at his Arpora nightclub on Saturday night.

HYDERABAD: The president of Tahreek Muslim Shabban, Mushtaq Malik, announced plans to establish a Babri Masjid memorial in Greater Hyderabad, along with welfare institutions, following a public meeting on the mosque's 33rd demolition anniversary on December 7.The announcement has sparked reactions from various political leaders, including BJP National General Secretary Tarun Chugh, who criticized suspended TMC MLA Humayun Kabir's separate initiative to lay the foundation stone for a Babri Masjid in Murshidabad, according to news agency ANI.Malik explained the decision was made during a routine public meeting at a mosque in Hyderabad. ""In view of the 33rd anniversary of the demolition of the Babri Masjid, a routine public meeting was held at the mosque in Hyderabad. At that meeting, we decided that a memorial for the Babri Masjid would be built in Greater Hyderabad, and some welfare institutions would also be built within it. We will soon announce how it will be built and for how long,"" he said.Malik addressed concerns about the mosque's name, dismissing them as political propaganda. ""No one should be bothered by the name of Babur. There was no evidence that any revenue came from Babur's side to build the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya.It's possible that some local person was named Babur, but the BJP and the RSS want to make Babur an issue. Babur's reign was very short,"" he stated.He referenced historical texts to support his argument. ""If we look at Tulsidas's Ramayana, it was written 60 years after the construction of the Babri Masjid. There's no mention in that Ramayana that the Ram Temple was demolished,"" he said.Malik discussed the religious tolerance of subsequent Mughal rulers. ""After Babur came Humayun's reign, and after that came Akbar's. There were rituals and prayers in Akbar's palace. Jodha Bai was in Akbar's palace. There were rituals, prayers, and havans... Tulsidas was also alive at that time. During Akbar's period, Tulsidas could have spoken to Akbar. Man Singh was the Chief of the Army at that time. He could have asked him. .. Such a thing doesn't appear in Tulsi Das's Ramayana,"" he explained.He expressed concern about community division. ""So, this is political propaganda to divide the country. The brotherhood that existed between Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, and Dalits has been shattered by this, and the seeds of hatred have been sown,"" he said.In a related development, BJP National General Secretary Tarun Chugh strongly condemned suspended TMC MLA Humayun Kabir's actions in Murshidabad. ""The same Babur who came to India aiming to wipe out the country's culture was condemned by Guru Nanak Sahib as a tyrant. He turned the Ganga, Yamuna and Saryu rivers red with Hindu blood. India will never accept any monument or object in his name,"" Chugh stated.Kabir defended his actions, stating they were constitutional. ""Anyone can build a temple, anyone can build a church; I will build a mosque. It is being said that we cannot build the Babri Masjid. It is not written anywhere. The Supreme Court gave a judgement which stated that the Hindu people had demolished the Babri Masjid. Considering the sentiments of Hindus, the decision was taken to build a temple here. Now we see someone laying the foundation stone for a Ram Temple in Sagardighi. But the Constitution allows us to build a mosque,"" he said.Kabir revealed plans for a 300-crore budget project including a hospital, guesthouse, and meeting hall.

Mamdani Launches First Attack On ICE Agents In NYC After Mayoral Win; 'Out, Out, You're Not...'





New York City’s Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani released a video explaining the rights of immigrants when confronted by ICE officers, days after a reported US Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid on Canal Street prompted public outcry.In the clip, posted late Sunday, he said, “We can all stand up to ICE if you know your rights,” as he pledged to defend the city’s more than three million immigrant residents. The video accompanied his post on X in which Mamdani wrote: “Know your rights. Protect your neighbours. New York is — and always will be — a city for all immigrants.”Mamdani said he would “protect the rights of every single New Yorker,” stressing that agents “cannot enter into private spaces, like your home, school, or private area of your workplace without a judicial warrant signed by a judge.” He warned that officers may present paperwork “that looks like this and tell you that they have the right to arrest you,” but added, “That is false. ICE is legally allowed to lie to you, but you have the right to remain silent. ”Mamdani also advised that individuals being questioned may ask “Am I free to go?” until they receive a clear answer, and said New Yorkers are allowed to film ICE agents provided they do not interfere with an arrest.“Remain calm. Do not impede their investigation, resist arrest or run,” he added, reiterating that the right to protest remains constitutionally protected.Mamdani, who met President Donald Trump in a surprisingly cordial Oval Office meeting weeks earlier, has positioned himself as a staunch opponent of aggressive immigration enforcement within the city. Closing his video, he said: “New York will always welcome immigrants, and I will fight each and every day to protect, support and celebrate our immigrant brothers and sisters.”His message followed a sequence of enforcement activities that have increased tension in the city. ABC News reported that his advisory was released shortly after federal agents carried out an operation in Manhattan, part of broader immigration enforcement drives across several US cities. The outlet also noted that demonstrators had gathered last weekend as agents attempted detentions on Canal Street, echoing a similar sweep last October that drew spontaneous protests in Chinatown.The New York Times reported that on November 28, protesters clashed with police outside a parking garage on Centre and Hester Streets. Dozens of federal agents from US Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Homeland Security had appeared to be assembling there ahead of a raid. The standoff escalated as protesters blocked the garage entrance with their bodies and piled garbage bags to prevent agents from exiting. The confrontation lasted nearly an hour, leading to several arrests and effectively stalling the operation.","New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani released a video explaining the rights of immigrants when confronted by ICE officers.

US President Donald Trump dodged a question about his “naughty list,” saying it's a long list and warning that naming names could “start aproblem out there in the world.”When the reporter asked, ""Who is on your naughty list, Trump jokingly replied that he had a “long list” before bragging about the United States being “the hottest country in the world. ” He added, “Ooooo… It’s a LONG list! I'd better not tell you, or it’ll cause a problem out there in the world. We've got a pretty big naughty list, but our country is doing well, we'e the hottest country anywhere in the world right, and a year ago we were a dead country,” Trump said.Several users on internet guessing the name for the list but the most common name came was ""Adam Schiff.""Earlier, the White House has launched a new web page called ‘Offender Hall of Shame’, to expose what they call ‘false and misleading stories’.Story links, news outlet names and information about the journalists who wrote the articles are all detailed on the web portal.Each story is categorised by ‘misrepresentation’, ‘omission of context’, ‘bias’, ‘malpractice’, ‘mischaracterisation’, ‘lie’, ‘false claim’ and even ‘left-wing lunacy’.On Sunday, Trump became the first president in US history to host the Kennedy Center Honors, amid turmoil within the performing arts centre after he removed the president and much of the governing body and installed himself as chairman.Since returning to office in January, Trump had made the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which is named after a Democratic predecessor, a touchstone in a broader attack against what he had lambasted as “woke” anti-American culture. Trump said in August that he had agreed to host the show.At a State Department dinner for the honorees on Saturday, he said he was doing so “at the request of a certain television network.” He predicted that the broadcast, scheduled to air Dec. 23 on CBS and Paramount+, would have its best ratings ever.“It’s going to be something that I believe, and I’m going to make a prediction: This will be the highest-rated show that they’ve ever done and they’ve gotten some pretty good ratings, but there’s nothing like what’s going to happen” on Sunday night, Trump said.He assumed the role that in the past had been held by journalists such as Walter Cronkite and Stephen Colbert, as well as comedians. Before him, presidents watched the show alongside the honorees. Trump skipped the honours altogether during his first term. Since 1978, the honours have recognised stars for their influence on American culture and the arts.This year’s class included Sylvester Stallone for his Rocky and Rambo films, Kiss for its flashy, cartoonish makeup and onstage pyrotechnics, Gloria Gaynor for her feminist anthem I Will Survive, country music superstar George Strait and Tony Award-winning actor Michael Crawford.Stallone said being honoured at the ceremony was like being in the “eye of a hurricane.” The action star stated ""This is an amazing event."" “But you’re caught up in the middle of it. It’s hard to take it in until the next day. ..: but I’m incredibly humbled by it,"" he added.Crawford said it was “humbling, especially at the end of a career.”Gaynor said it “feels like a dream” to be honoured. “To be recognized in this way is the pinnacle,” she said on the red carpet.","US President Donald Trump dodged a question about his “naughty list,” saying it’s a long list and warning that naming names could “start aproblem out there in the world” On Sunday, Trump became the first president in US history to host the Kennedy Center Honors, amid turmoil within the performing arts centre.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125824463,imgsize-44420,width-400,resizemode-4/us-president-donald-trump.jpg"

US President Donald Trump on Saturday mocked late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel and called him ""horrible"" while presenting the 2025 Kennedy Center Honours honourees with their medals at the Oval Office.“We have never had a president hosting the awards before. This is the first,” Trump said while addressing reporters, as per Deadline. “I’m sure they’ll give me great reviews, right? You know, they’ll say he was horrible. He was terrible. It was a horrible situation. No, we’ll do fine.”He then compared himself with previous hosts, saying, “I watched some of the people that host. Jimmy Kimmel was horrible, and some of these people. If I can’t beat out Jimmy Kimmel in terms of talent, then I don’t think I should be president.”Trump, who appointed himself chairman of the Kennedy Center in February, said in August that he was “about 98 percent involved” in selecting the honourees. This year’s recipients are Sylvester Stallone , George Strait , KISS, Gloria Gaynor and Michael Crawford.The remarks came amid an ongoing feud between Trump and Kimmel, which escalated when Jimmy Kimmel Live! was suspended for six days in September over comments the host made following Charlie Kirk’s death.During a visit to the United Kingdom, Trump said Kimmel was “fired for lack of talent.”Last month, on Truth Social, he called the host a “man with NO TALENT and VERY POOR TELEVISION RATINGS” and wrote, “Get the bum off the air!!!”Kimmel later addressed the post, saying that his wife told him about Trump’s social media message when he woke up. “I’m the bum. I’m the bum. And he posted this, I think this is interesting, at 12:49 a.m., 11 minutes after the show ended on the East Coast, which is nice,” he teased.","US President Donald Trump mocked late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel and called him ""horrible"" He was presenting the 2025 Kennedy Center Honours honourees with their medals at the Oval Office.

Won't quit politics if I get a pardon: Netanyahu





JERUSALEM: Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said the second phase of a US plan to end the war in Gaza was close, but cautioned several key issues still needed to be resolved, including whether a multinational security force would be deployed in the Gaza strip.Netanyahu, speaking to reporters alongside German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, said that he would hold talks with US President Donald Trump at the end of the month on how to ensure the plan's second phase was achieved.The prime minister's office in Nov said that Trump had invited Netanyahu to the White House ""in the near future"".A Hamas member said Sunday the group is ready to discuss ""freezing or storing"" its arsenal of weapons as part of its ceasefire with Israel, offering a possible formula to resolve one of the thorniest issues in the agreement. Bassem Naim, a member of Hamas' decision-making political bureau, said, ""We are open to have a comprehensive approach in order to avoid further escalations or clashes.""A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is entering its second month, although both sides have accused each other of violating the truce agreement. Netanyahu said that it was important to ensure Hamas not only upholds the ceasefire but also follows through on ""their commitment"" to the plan to disarm and for Gaza to be demilitarised.According to the plan, Israel is to pull back further in the second phase as a transitional authority is established and a multinational security force is deployed, Hamas is disarmed, and reconstruction begins.A multinational coordination centre has been established in Israel, but there are no deadlines in the plan and officials involved say that efforts to advance it have stalled. ""What will be the timeline? What are the forces that are coming in? Will we have international forces? If not, what are the alternatives? These are all topics that are being discussed,"" Netanyahu said.Merz said that Germany was willing to help rebuild Gaza but would wait for Netanyahu's meeting with Trump, and for clarity on what Washington was prepared to do, before Berlin decides what it would contribute but that phase two ""must come now"".Netanyahu said on Sunday that he would not retire from politics if he receives a pardon from the president in years-long graft trial.","Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu says the second phase of a US plan to end the war in Gaza was close.

FBI weighs Candace Owens’ explosive claim that France paid for a hit squad to kill her





Candace Owens’ latest accusation has set off a storm bigger than any of her past controversies, pulling in foreign governments, media figures, and now the FBI. The conservative commentator recently claimed that French President Emmanuel Macron authorized an assassination plot targeting her, allegedly involving a team from France’s National Gendarmerie Intervention Group, which she insists includes “one Israeli. ”The accusation was widely mocked online, but it landed on the desk of FBI Director Kash Patel, who was confronted with the claims during a tense interview on The Megyn Kelly Show. While Patel did not validate the theory, his response opened the door to a new level of scrutiny over Owens’ explosive allegations.Last month, Owens posted her original accusation on X, writing that a “high-ranking employee of the French Government” warned her of an assassination order. She claimed, “the Macrons have executed upon and paid for my assassination,” adding that the plot was already “formalized.”She further alleged the hit squad includes “one Israeli” and linked it to the murder of Turning Point USA’s Charlie Kirk, insisting, “The head of state of France apparently wants us both dead.”On Kelly’s show, Patel was asked point-blank whether he believed a foreign government targeted Owens.Patel didn’t support her claim, but he didn’t dismiss it either: “Any American that receives a death threat from overseas or anywhere in America is going to be fully investigated. So we’re not going to turn our eye away from that investigation or any others.”When pressed again, he clarified, “So fa-, we are just looking at everything that comes in… If someone feels that their life is being threatened, we are of course looking at it.”What Patel didn’t provide was evidence. He admitted the FBI has “zero” credible reason to believe foreign governments were behind Kirk’s assassination and offered nothing to support Owens’ theory. Owens, who has repeatedly suggested conspiracies involving France, Israel, and even Kirk’s associates, now finds herself challenged by those she accused, who invited her to a public event to present proof. She accepted, until she didn’t.Whether Owens’ claim is a genuine tip or her most sensational conspiracy yet, Patel’s refusal to outright dismiss it ensures the story won’t fade anytime soon.Also Read: “Provide a description…”: Candace Owens challenges Tim Pool’s shooting claim, demands proof after alleged attack","Conservative commentator Candace Owens claimed French President Emmanuel Macron authorized an assassination plot against her.
