Justice Trivedi's career recap

Boycott of judge’s farewell not in good taste, says CJI

NEW DELHI: CJI B R Gavai on Friday disapproved of the decision of the Supreme Court Bar Association and the SC Advocates-on-Record Association to boycott the courtroom farewell for Justice Bela M Trivedi , the tenth woman judge in the 75-year history of the court.The boycott stemmed from a split decision of an SC bench on punishment to an AoR who had reportedly suppressed material and attempted to mislead the court in a criminal case. While Justice Trivedi had ordered the AoR’s name to be struck off the rolls for a month, her colleague Satish C Sharma had let him off with a warning.During the farewell in the CJI’s courtroom, many advocates, especially women, complimented Justice Bela M Trivedi for a sterling career that exemplified integrity, hard work and protection of institutional dignity.She had joined Ahmedabad City civil court as an additional district and sessions judge in 1995, when her father, too, was a judge in that court. She became an high court judge in 2011 and was appointed as a judge of Supreme Court in Aug 2021.CJI B R Gavai said though Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president Kapil Sibal was present, the boycott of farewell of a judge by the two associations was not in good taste. “We deprecate such a stand of SCBA and SC Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAORA).” CJI’s bench partner Justice A G Masih said, “Good traditions must be followed and respected.”Justice Trivedi, who will retire on June 9, would not be available on the last working day of SC on May 23 prior to the summer break as she has a family wedding in the US. She said it is for the first time that the CJI has broken tradition to invite all her relatives for tea after the ceremonial bench, and dinner.Attorney general R Venkataramani said Justice Trivedi delivered justice while scrupulously adhering to the law. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, “Justice Trivedi has never attempted to mould relief to suit popular sentiments, which is a rare thing. This needs courage of conviction, courage to displease people. I lost most of the matters before her, as HC or SC judge, but our respect can never depend on the relief we got or refused.”SG Mehta said, “There are certain individuals who feel that ‘my word should be the last word in law’ and that never happened in Justice Trivedi’s court, where the last word was the word of law even if it was at the expense of displeasing some people... Our respect and love for the judge is not contingent upon whether relief is being granted or not.”",CJI B R Gavai disapproved of the decision of the Supreme Court Bar Association and the SC Advocates-on-Record Association to boycott the courtroom farewell for Justice Bela M Trivedi.

"First Tharoor, now Chidambaram: Senior leaders put Congress on backfoot",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/first-tharoor-now-chidambaram-senior-leaders-put-congress-on-backfoot/articleshow/121217409.cms,"Also Read:

NEW DELHI: The Congress is once again under BJP fire. And once again, the ammunition for this all-out attack has been provided by a party leader. P Chidambaram 's reality check on the future of INDIA bloc has left the Congress scurrying for cover.""The future (of INDIA bloc) is not so bright, as Mritunjay Singh Yadav said. He seems to feel that the alliance is still intact, but I am not sure. It is only Salman (Khurshid) who can answer because he was part of the negotiating team for the INDIA bloc. If the alliance is totally intact, I will be very happy. But it shows at the seams that it is frayed,"" Chidambaram said at a book launch in the national capital on Thursday.He also hoped that the alliance can ""still be put together, there's still time"".The BJP, as expected, latched on to Chidambaram's remarks and unleashed a fierce offensive against the Congress. And why not? After all, the leadership of opposition's INDIA bloc is with the grand-old-party and Mallikarjun Kharge is its chairperson. So, Chidambaram's assessment points to failure of the Congress leadership to lead the opposition coalition effectively.Ironically, his remarks come at a time when the Congress was already struggling over statements made by Shashi Tharoor in support of PM Modi's policies during the India-Pakistan standoff. Several BJP leaders cited Tharoor's remarks praising several government's policies, including the ceasefire decision, to slam and school the Congress leadership.It was only yesterday that Congress leader Jairam Ramesh officially announced that Tharoor's remarks were his personal views. ""When Mr. Tharoor speaks, it is his view and it is not the stand of the party,"" Jairam Ramesh had said yesterday. Some reports citing Congress sources had suggested that the party had expressed displeasure with Tharoor's statements and was of the view that the Thiruvananthapuram MP had crossed the Lakshman Rekha this time around. However, Tharoor had dismissed these reports and called them ""media creation without any evidence.""Chidambaram's statement coming in this backdrop put the party once again on the backfoot.Citing Chidambaram's reality check, the BJP and its allies have been relentless in targeting the Congress and the INDIA bloc calling it a ""greed-driven coalition"", ""Maha-thagbandhan"", ""opportunistic alliance"", ""kushti-dosti model"", ""company of looters"", ""group of corrupt leaders"", ""ghamandiya alliance"". Some even raised questions on Congress's leadership role and claimed that the grand-old-party is fading and has no future.INDIA bloc, which was launched with a lot of fanfare, is actually gasping for breath today and to that extent Chidambaram is spot on in his assessment. But to announce that from a public platform definetely helps party's political rivals - the BJP in this case.It will be interesting to see how the Congress reacts to this new challenge. Party leader Udit Raj, who had slammed Tharoor for 'becoming BJP's spokesperson', had a word of advice for Chidambaram. ""Party has given him a lot. He and his son are MPs. Since the party is not in power, Chidambaram ji should go around the country and conduct a dialogue,"" he said.Tharoor has been at loggerheads with the party for some time now, but Chidambaram's remarks may have come as a surprise. Interestingly, last week when BJP national general secretary Radha Mohan Das Agrawal had slammed the Congress over demand to sack Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah for his controversial statement on Col Sofia Qureshi, he had cited both Tharoor and Chidambaram to prove his point.""If people start giving resignation for statements, then no one would be left in the Congress except for P Chidambaram and Shashi Tharoor. We should first demand Rahul Gandhi's resignation,"" the BJP general secretary had said. The fact that both these leaders have put Congress in a spot of bother may be a matter of coincidence. Perhaps.",Congress leader P Chidambaram says the future of INDIA bloc is not so bright. BJP has latched on to the remarks and unleashed a fierce offensive against the Congress. Congress was already struggling over statements made by Shashi Tharoor in support of PM Modi's policies.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121217659,imgsize-1338250,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
Operation Sindoor: BJP defends MP deputy CM as a row erupts over his remarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-bjp-defends-mp-deputy-cm-as-a-row-erupts-over-his-remarks/articleshow/121221667.cms,"MP deputy CM Jagdish Devda

Sack Devda & Vijay Shah, demands Congress

BHOPAL: Even as BJP is battling the crisis triggered by Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah’s comments on Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, a fresh controversy erupted Friday over a statement by deputy CM Jagdish Devda.Thanking PM Narendra Modi while lauding the military’s courage in Op Sindoor, Devda said at a training programme for civil defence volunteers in Jabalpur Friday: “Yashaswi Pradhan Mantriji ko hum dhanyawad dena chahenge. Aur poora desh, desh ki woh sena, woh sainik, unke charno mein natmastak hain. Unke charno mein poora desh natmastak hain. Unhone jo jawab diya hai, uski jitni sarahna ki jaye, jitni kaha jaye utna kam hai.” The dispute is over Devda using the words ‘unke charno mein’. While Congress claimed Devda meant the ‘PM’s feet’, BJP said he meant the Army’s feet.BJP, which is on a defensive after Shah’s remark, stoutly defended Devda, with IT cell chief Amit Malviya alleging that Congress is targeting the deputy CM because he is a Dalit. “Congress is unable to accept that a Dalit leader holds such a prominent position,” he said.“Deliberately distorting Devda ji’s statement is an attempt to create sensation and an atmosphere of lies,” Malviya tweeted. Devda warned of legal action, saying: “My speech is being presented in a wrong and distorted manner, which is absolutely improper. I said that the courage shown by the Army in conducting Operation Sindoor against terrorists cannot be praised enough. The entire country and the people of the country bow at their feet and salute them. I too salute them.” Devda defended himself by saying: “What I meant was people of the country salute brave soldiers of the Army. My statement is being circulated in the wrong manner. I have not given any such statement for which an apology is required nor have I hurt anyone’s feelings.”Slamming MP deputy CM Jagdish Devda for allegedly saying that defence forces and its soldiers are at PM Modi’s feet and state minister Vijay Shah for his comments about Colonel Qureshi, Congress Friday said the BJP netas should be sacked from state govt without delay, else their utterances would be seen as having the approval of Modi and the BJP brass.Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said comments from BJP politicians are tantamount to sedition but BJP is going all out to protect them, and the MP CM has already ruled out action against Shah. She asked how could Devda say “defence forces are at the PM’s feet” when they are responsible for maintaining peace, and when the country is full of respect for the way they stunned Pakistan in the recent face-off.“These words are like committing a sin and BJP is doing it time and again,” Shrinate told reporters. “An apology or regret will not work this time. Devda has to be sacked. BJP cannot be a bystander this time.”","Madhya Pradesh deputy CM Jagdish Devda allegedly said that defence forces and its soldiers are at PM Modi’s feet.

Govt to send all-party teams to brief nations on Pak-sponsored terrorism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-to-send-all-party-teams-to-brief-nations-on-pak-sponsored-terrorism/articleshow/121220536.cms,"Congress’s Kharge and Rahul Gandhi speak to the media after the meet

NEW DELHI: Stepping up its diplomatic offensive on Operation Sindoor , govt has decided to send five all-party delegations of MPs to different parts of the world starting next week to highlight Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Each team will have eight members.MPs belonging to BJP, Congress, TMC, DMK, NCP (SP), JDU, BJD, Shiv Sena (UBT), CPM and some other parties will be part of the delegations which are meant to signal national unity.Sources said some former ministers would lead the delegations scheduled to visit various countries over a period period of 10 days. MEA will brief the MPs before they depart.Though all parties appeared to be on board, Congress sources were angry that govt had reached out to its MPs and others directly instead of approaching the leadership first. Sources said while party members would join the delegations in “supreme national interest”, it was for the leadership to decide who from its ranks would go. They particularly appeared to be unhappy about the likelihood of Shashi Tharoor being the choice to head one of the delegations, possibly the one to the US. “He, being chairman of the standing committee on external affairs, should have been the logical choice, but his remarks have lately been out of line with the party’s stand,” said a source.Congress sources also indicated that they would push for the inclusion of deputy leader in Lok Sabha Gaurav Gogoi in one of the teams.Govt expressed surprise at Congress’s response. “Members of delegations are supposed to pursue national interest and not work as representatives of political parties. They are going there as Indians,” a source said. “The practice has always been that govt chooses the members. So far nobody has objected,” he added.A leader of a party that has been sounded out for the exercise said they were asked to be ready to leave by May 22-23 for a period of 10 days and that MEA would be in touch with them to provide details, including the itinerary.Former Union ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Anurag Thakur, Aparajita Sarangi, Samik Bhattacharya and Brij Lal are among the BJP members to be part of the teams, sources said.At least four MPs from Congress, besides members of other parties, have been tapped by govt for the exercise. They include Tharoor, Manish Tewari, Salman Khurshid and Amar Singh. However, Congress sources said at least three leaders told govt that it should contact their party leadership for the names.TMC’s Sudip Bandyopadhyay, JDU’s Sanjay Jha, BJD’s Sasmit Patra, CPM’s John Brittas, UBT’s Priyanka Chaturvedi, NCP (SP)’s Supriya Sule, DMK’s K Kanimozhi, AIMIM’s Asaduddin Owaisi and AAP’s Vikramjit Sawhney are also being tapped to be part of the delegations, sources said.While Khurshid, a former external affairs minister, has been asked to lead a delegation of seven MPs to south and south-east Asia, covering countries such as South Korea, Japan and Singapore, Baramati MP Sule is likely to lead a team to West Asia and Africa, including the likes of Oman, Egypt, Kenya and South Africa, sources said.Tewari is likely to lead a delegation to Europe or West Asia and has been asked about his availability while Tharoor could lead a team to the US, they said, adding that former Union minister Ghulam Nabi Azad was likely to be part of one delegation.While there was no official word from govt on the delegations, Congress’s Jairam Ramesh said Union minister Kiren Rijiju had spoken to party president Mallikarjun Kharge.",Five all-party delegations of MPs will be sent to different parts of the world starting next week.

Despite warning, Dhadda helped Dalla get bail

NEW DELHI: The Lawrence Bishnoi group claimed the killing of a Sikh businessman in Ontario’s Mississauga early Thursday. The victim, Harjit Singh Dhadda , was shot multiple times near his office. Bishnoi’s aide, Rohit Godara , owned up to the killing, accusing Dhadda of furnishing a bail bond for Khalistan Tiger Force chief Arsh Dalla.“I, Rohit Godara, along with Goldy Brother, am taking responsibility. This man was close to our enemies. He got his brother Mehal Singh Uttarakhand murdered by giving money to Arsh Dalla and Sukha Dunuke. All were named in that case,” Godara said in a post.Godara’s post said Dhadda was given a warning a year ago but despite that he helped Arsh Dalla’s release on bail two months ago. “This will be the fate of whoever supports our enemy,” it added.Dhadda, a businessman in the trucking services industry, was shot dead near the intersection of Telford Way and Derry Road in Mississauga, Canada, the local police said. Dhadda was standing near his car when unidentified assailants, believed to have been lying in wait, approached and fired around 20 rounds before fleeing the scene. The gunfire caused panic in the parking lot.A staffer of a local office narrowly avoided injury when a stray bullet entered their office and hit an empty chair, just moments after they stood up. An eyewitness described the scene, saying the gunmen exited a parked car, fired many shots at close range. Dhadda was rushed to the hospital in critical condition but later succumbed to his injuries.Dalla, who replaced slain terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, fled to Canada in July 2020. He was linked to multiple heinous crimes such as murder, extortion, and targeted killings, with more than 13 FIRs registered against him. In January 2023, he was designated a terrorist by the Union home ministry for his involvement in a series of murders, extortion, terror funding, and targeted killings besides terrorist activities.Godara, on the other hand, is on Interpol’s list of wanted men. Interpol issued a red corner notice against Godara in December last year following a request from Indian law enforcement agencies. “On June 13, 2022, Godara is learnt to have fled from Delhi to Dubai on a forged passport issued in the name of one ‘Pawan Kumar’. He is learnt to have taken the same route as his associate, Sachin Bishnoi, who also went to Azerbaijan and was staying in Baku,” said an official.","Harjit Singh Dhadda was shot multiple times near his office.

IAEA Confirms No Nuclear Radiation Leak from Kirana Hills Nuclear Facility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/iaea-denies-radiation-leak-in-pak-after-op-sindoor-airstrikes/articleshow/121168129.cms,"Representative Image (AI)





DEHRADUN: There was no radiation leak or release from any nuclear facility in Pakistan, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Wednesday (IST), rejecting widespread reports that claimed Indian missiles struck Kirana Hills in Pakistan's Sargodha district during Operation Sindoor, triggering a radioactive incident.The clarification followed social media speculation and foreign media theories suggesting a nuclear stockpile in Pakistan had been hit during the airstrikes. Fredrik Dahl from IAEA's press department in an email response to TOI's query stated, ""We are aware of the reports. Based on information available to the IAEA, there was no radiation leak or release from any nuclear facility in Pakistan.""The development came two days after Indian Air Force's director general air operations, Air Marshal A K Bharti, denied that India had targeted Kirana Hills or any nuclear installation in Pakistan. When asked by the media, Bharti said, ""Thank you for telling us that Kirana Hills houses nuclear installations. We didn't know about it. We have not hit Kirana Hills and whatever is there.""The ministry of external affairs also rejected reports of a radiation leak. Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, during a press briefing on Tuesday, said, ""Our military action was entirely within the conventional domain. Some reports were suggesting that Pakistan's National Command Authority would convene a meeting, but those were later denied.In fact, Pakistan's govt representatives have officially denied this on record. ""IAEA's statement sought to dispel speculation that a radiation leak led to the ceasefire between India and Pakistan. Some foreign experts on global media platforms had amplified the theories, claiming the reports were accurate. The rumours intensified after some flight tracking platforms allegedly spotted a US department of energy aircraft—used in nuclear emergencies like Fukushima—near Pakistan.Another claim that an Egyptian military aircraft landed in Pakistan carrying boron, a chemical used to contain radioactive emissions, also circulated. Both these claims were unverified and dismissed by former military officials as baseless. Lt Gen Mohan Bhandari (retd), who served as deputy director general military operations during the Kargil war, told TOI, ""Hitting any nuclear installation is a very irresponsible thing to do, which the highly professional Indian forces will never do. All these stories are bogus conspiracy theories that can't be believed.""He added, ""Above all, both countries in 1988 signed the India-Pakistan Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack Against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, or simply called the non-attack agreement. Under this, both maintain an understanding of not attacking each other's nuclear installations as it would then lead to a devastating armed escalation. Having said that, our forces are fully ready to respond to any misadventure by Pakistan.

Trump has spoken about her previously, particularly when there is a large news event. During one House Republican meeting, Trump spoke about Swift, fearing she might vote for President Joe Biden in the election.Previously, Trump called SwiftThis latest post appeared to have been a jab at the pop star, particularly if Swift is already embroiled in her controversy. She has found herself involved in a court case with her former friend Blake Lively and actor Justin Baldoni.Some of the letters that were part of the case even attempted to enlist Swift's help in garnering support for Lively. The court, however, dismissed the letter.Having blasted Swift, Trump then focused his wrath on Bruce Springsteen, labeling the rock musicianTrump bashed Springsteen's music and politics as a ""pushy, obnoxious JERK.Trump's remarks followed Springsteen criticizing the Trump administration during a concert in Manchester, England.The rock star condemned the government as harming American workers and deserting those in need across the globe.

Indian-origin man slammed for opposing H-1B visas: 'We will welcome you to Kozhikode with open arms',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-origin-man-slammed-for-opposing-h-1b-visas-we-will-welcome-you-to-kozhikode-with-open-arms/articleshow/121214022.cms,"Indian-origin man was trolled on X for opposing H-1B visa program.





An Indian-origin man in the US, Rohit Joy , was slammed on X as he reacted to some recent H-1B updates. In his opinion, all H-1B visa s should expire and all H-1B visa holders should be sent back to their home countries. As his X bio says he's an Indian by blood, and an Oregonian by birth and Texan by choice, the Republican supporter drew backlash mostly from Indians who questioned him on his opinion -- some even suggested him to change his name as it's evidently Indian.All of it started with some of the Congressmen pushing for the domestic visa renewal program for the H-1B. Under the existing rule, H-1B visa holders have to get their visa renewed from the US embassy of their own country and it takes months. Several Congressmen, including those of Indian origin like Ro Khanna, recently wrote to Secretary of State Marco Rubio to allow the renewal in the US only saving time for the companies that hire them as well.Reacting to this push, the Indian-origin man denounced H-1B and said the program has nothing to do with keeping America competitive.""Nope. All H-1B visas should expire, the program should be ended, and visa holders should be sent back to their home countries.It has nothing to do with keeping America competitive.

Blocking out the noise: Shannon Sharpe calls out public perception and media speculation

NFL Hall of Famer and popular media personality Shannon Sharpe has publicly addressed the ongoing $50 million sexual assault lawsuit filed against him by OnlyFans model Gabriella Zuniga. The woman, who claims she was just 19 when she began dating Sharpe, 56, accuses him of physical abuse and threats during their relationship. Sharpe has vehemently denied the allegations, stating their relationship was consensual and backing his defense with explicit text messages exchanged between the two.On a recent episode of his podcast Night Cap, co-hosted by Chad Ochocinco, Sharpe finally broke his silence, thanking fans and supporters for standing by him during what he described as a deeply challenging time.“I just need the people that I love to love me. And obviously, the elephant is not in the room, he outside. But everybody knows what I’m going through. A lot of people have a lot to say,” Sharpe said. “But, I met a lot of people and thank y’all to everybody that’s reached out and [sending] thoughts and prayers—I sincerely appreciate that. But when you think about it, Ocho, man: 50 percent of people don’t care that you got problems. The other 50 percent are glad you got’em. So now what?”His comments offered a glimpse into the emotional toll the lawsuit has taken on him and revealed his focus on staying grounded amid public scrutiny.Sharpe also addressed how public narratives often distort reality, especially in high-profile cases. “Everybody gonna have an opinion. Everybody think they know you…when they really don’t. They heard this, they heard that. Have you ever talked to Shannon?…So what makes you think you know him? How well do you know him?” he continued, emphasizing the dangers of judgment without firsthand understanding.In the wake of the lawsuit, Sharpe announced that he would be stepping away from his role at ESPN.

Where will FBI's new headquarters be?







Indian-origin FBI director Kash Patel , who was recently accused of skipping office most days and working from home, revealed that he is planning to relocate 1,500 agents out of the Hoover building for safety reasons. In an exclusive interview with Fox News that will air this Sunday, Patel said the headquarters is unsafe for the workforce.""This FBI is leaving the Hoover building because this building is unsafe for our workforce and we want… the American men and women to know, if you're going to come work at the premier law enforcement agency in the world, we're going to give you a building that's commensurate with that, and that's not this place,"" Patel said in the preview of the interview that was released on Friday.Recently, Patel was on the radar for his use of FBI jets for private trips which is the only way the FBI director is allowed to travel but questions were raised as to whether he was reimbursing for the many private tours that he made. A former FBI official claimed Patel is spotted more at nightclubs and less at the office. Some reports citing FBI insiders claimed Patel apparently has no interest in FBI -- he cancelled the daily morning meeting and made it twice a week, and did away with the weekly telecall with the leaders of the FBI field officers.Patel's staff said it was a malicious campaign, and Kash Patel's work speaks for themselves. He changed the meeting schedule not to fit his convenience but for safety reasons, they said.Now this safety issue is at the forefront with the FBI headquarters moving out of its decades-old address of decades.""Look, the FBI is 38,000 when we're fully manned, which we're not. In the national capital region, in the 50-mile radius around Washington, DC, there were 11,000 FBI employees,"" Patel said. ""That's like a third of the workforce. A third of the crime doesn't happen here, so we're taking 1,500 of those folks and moving them out.""""Every state's getting a plus-up, and I think when we do things like that, we inspire folks in America to become intel analysts and agents and say, 'we want to go work at the FBI because we want to go fight violent crime, and we want to get sent out into the country to do it,'"" Patel added. ""That's what we're doing in the next three, six, nine months we're going to do that hard.""The options are being weighed in by the FBI and the Government Services Administration. Locations news DC in Maryland and Virginia were earlier explored. The search for a new headquarters is not new and in late 2023, the GSA chose a site in Greenbelt, Maryland, that could serve as the main headquarters. But those attempts did not fructify earlier.","Indian-origin FBI director Kash Patel revealed that he is planning to relocate 1,500 agents out of the Hoover building for safety reasons.

'Misgendering' now considered discrimination in this US state: Here's what the law says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/misgendering-now-considered-discrimination-in-this-us-state-heres-what-the-law-says/articleshow/121226889.cms,"



Colorado Governor Jared Polis has signed House Bill 1312 into law, marking a significant shift in how the state handles discrimination against transgender individuals. While early drafts of the legislation stirred controversy, its final version still delivers key protections, including restrictions on “misgendering” and “deadnaming” in specific contexts.The bill, named the “Kelly Loving Act” after a transgender woman killed in the 2022 Club Q shooting, expands Colorado’s anti-discrimination laws. It no longer explicitly mentions the terms “misgendering” or “deadnaming”, but it lays out provisions that indirectly address those actions by mandating inclusive practices across public records, education, and identification documents.Originally, HB 1312 included far-reaching clauses, including a requirement that courts consider “deadnaming” and “misgendering” in child custody disputes as forms of coercive control. Those sections were ultimately removed after significant public pushback and concerns raised by groups across the political spectrum. Over 700 people signed up to testify at a Senate hearing – the highest number for any bill this session.Polis, a Democrat and the nation’s first openly gay governor, acknowledged the controversy. He said he was “not comfortable” with the family law provisions in the initial draft, praising the final version for better reflecting public consensus.“A lot of the controversial parts were removed during the legislative process,” he added. “What’s left are a few provisions that make it easier to reflect the gender identity of folks. ”Under the law, individuals can now update their marriage or civil union licences with a new name without the revised certificate being marked as amended. The same applies to sex designation changes on a Colorado driver's licence, which may now be made up to three times before a court order is required.In educational settings, students are allowed to choose names for any reason if a school has a name policy in place. Dress code policies must now permit all students to choose among available options, regardless of gender identity.The bill also includes a clause that prevents Colorado courts from recognising laws from other states that would penalise parents for supporting a child’s access to gender-affirming care.Despite the removal of some of its original provisions, HB 1312 still marks a landmark moment in LGBTQ+ rights in Colorado.

CHENNAI: He accused her of having an affair with her female friend. The court later found that this was part of a calculated cycle of abuse meant to humiliate, control, and drive her into silence. But she fought back.A city court has now ordered the man to pay Rs 5 lakh as compensation and restrained him and his parents from coming anywhere near the woman-his wife of just 43 days.The wife said no to forced sex, questioned dowry demands, and refused to return to a house where she was watched through windows, denied food, and mocked for not conceiving.She also told the court he coerced her into sex while drunk and turned aggressive when she resisted.

His parents allegedly joined him in threatening her with a knife and hurling stones at her house. She filed three police complaints in total, citing continued harassment even after initiating divorce proceedings. Even in court, the abuse didn't stop.The magistrate noted that the husband's counsel attempted to ""tease the petitioner and her mother's character during cross-examination""-which the court immediately curtailed. Despite 12 adjournments, he failed to produce any evidence.

'Gaza is a nasty place. It should become a freedom zone,' says Trump

Trump: If I didn't do this, China would have broken apart





The Trump administration is working on a strategy to permanently move up to 1 million Palestinians from Gaza to Libya, according to NBC News.Senior officials have engaged in discussions with Libyan leadership regarding this initiative. The proposal includes potentially unfreezing billions in US-held Libyan funds as compensation.The deliberations remain ongoing, with Israel being kept informed, according to NBC News citing sources.However, later, a State Department spokesperson denied these claims, stating ""these reports are untrue"" and describing the situation as unsuitable for such arrangements.“The situation on the ground is untenable for such a plan. Such a plan was not discussed and makes no sense,” the spokesperson said.Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official, said that they were not aware of any discussions about moving Palestinians to Libya.“Palestinians are very rooted in their homeland, very strongly committed to the homeland and they are ready to fight up to the end and to sacrifice anything to defend their land, their homeland, their families, and the future of their children,” Naim said in response to questions from NBC News.“[Palestinians] are exclusively the only party who have the right to decide for the Palestinians, including Gaza and Gazans, what to do and what not to do. ”Libya has been plagued by instability and warring political factions throughout the nearly 14 years since a civil war broke out in the country and its longtime dictator, Moammar Gadhafi, was toppled. Libya is struggling to care for its current population as two rival governments, one in the west led by Abdul Hamid Dbeibah and one in the east led by Khalifa Haftar, are actively and violently fighting for control. The State Department currently advises Americans not to travel to Libya “due to crime, terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict. ”In an interview with Fox News, Trump called Gaza a nasty place and said that it should become a freedom zone.""Gaza is a nasty place. It’s been that way for years… It should become a freedom zone. It doesn’t work. Every ten years, they go back, they have Hamas,"" Trump said.Responding to a question about the countries that the US President visited going to have to be a part of the solution, Trump said, “They absolutely would be.”He continued telling that he wanted to take care of the people in Gaza.""Look, people are starving.

One of the things that one of the three great leaders that I saw two nights ago said to me, please help the people, the Palestinians, I said, other than the abbess, what do you mean by that? He said, they're starving. And he meant it with his heart. They're starving. So I've already started working on that,"" Trump said in an interview.""It's a deep problem, but we'll get it solved. And a very immediate and a very big problem is, you know, I'm so proud of what we were able to do with India and with Pakistan. Well, it's a potential problem like that that we have here. I'll get it solved, and one way or the other, I'll get it solved. It's either going to be done nicely or it's going to be done violently. And I, 99.9% want to do it nicely if we can,"" he added.","The proposal includes potentially unfreezing billions in US-held Libyan funds as compensation.

"At least 4 dead after tornado and severe storm batters St Louis, mayor says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/at-least-4-dead-after-tornado-and-severe-storm-batters-st-louis-mayor-says/articleshow/121225691.cms,"At least 4 dead after tornado and severe storm batters St. Louis, mayor says





ST LOUIS - At least four people died and authorities were searching from building to building for people who were trapped or hurt after severe storms including a possible tornado swept through St Louis.The storms Friday afternoon tore roofs off buildings, ripped bricks off of siding and downed trees and power lines as residents were urged to take cover.St Louis Mayor Cara Spencer confirmed the deaths at a media briefing.""This is truly, truly devastating,"" Spencer said, adding that the city was in the process of declaring an emergency. National Weather Service radar indicated that a tornado touched down between 2:30 p.m. and 2:50 p.m. in Clayton, Missouri, in the St. Louis area. The apparent tornado touched down in the area of Forest Park, home to the St. Louis Zoo and the site of the 1904 World's Fair and Olympic Games the same year, Pfahler said.At Centennial Christian Church, City of St. Louis Fire Department Battalion Chief William Pollihan told The Associated Press that three people had to be rescued after part of the church crumbled. One of those people died.""Pray for our church,"" Centennial Christian posted on its Facebook page.Jeffrey Simmons Sr., who lives across the street from the church, heard an alert on his phone and then the lights went out.""And next thing you know, a lot of noise, heavy wind,"" he said. He and his brother went into the basement. Later, he realized it was worse than he thought: ""Everything was tore up.""Stacy Clark said his mother-in-law Patricia Penelton died in the church. He described her as a very active church volunteer who had many roles, including being part of the choir.Downed trees and stop lights also caused traffic gridlock during the Friday afternoon commute, and officials urged people to avoid driving if possible.""If you do not have to travel, PLEASE STAY HOME,"" the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department said in a social media post.The upper stories of the Harlem Taproom's brick building were demolished when the storm came through, leaving piles of bricks around the outside. About 20 people were inside, but they huddled in the back of the building and none of them were hurt, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.John Randle, a 19-year-old University of Missouri-St Louis student, said he and his girlfriend were at the St. Louis Art Museum during the storm and got hustled into the basement with about 150 other people.He said they could hear tree branches and hail hitting the building's windows and that he went up a flight of stairs to the main entrance for about 10 seconds.""You could see the doors flying open, tree branches flying by and people running,"" he said. ""A lot of people were caught outside.""Christy Childs, a spokesperson for the Saint Louis Zoo, said in a text that the zoo would remain closed Saturday because of downed trees and other damage. Childs said all animals were safe and that there were no reports of significant injuries to staff, guests or animals.""We can't definitively say whether or not it was a tornado -- it likely was,"" National Weather Service meteorologist Marshall Pfahler said. Radar also confirmed a tornado above Venice, Illinois, on Friday afternoon. Venice is northeast of St. Louis, just across the Mississippi River.The storms were part of a severe weather system that spawned tornadoes in Wisconsin, downed trees, left thousands without power in the Great Lakes region and brought a punishing heat wave to Texas.Appalachia and Midwest face danger Weather forecasters warned that severe storms with hail and even hurricane-force winds could hobble parts of Appalachia and the Midwest on Friday. Tornadoes were also a risk there.In Illinois, the weather service issued a dust storm warning around the Chicago area on Friday night. It said a wall of dust extended along a 100-mile (161-kilometer) line from southwest of Chicago to northern Indiana that severely reduced visibility.The National Weather Service said residents in Kentucky, southern Indiana, southern Illinois, parts of Tennessee, Missouri, Arkansas and Ohio should brace for intense storms that could include baseball-sized hail.The weather service's Storm Prediction Center said that ""strong, potentially long-track tornadoes and very large hail"" could be expected. The threat for damaging winds in excess of 75 mph will increase into this evening as storms grow into larger clusters.Ahead of Friday night's anticipated storm, Appalachian Power, which serves 1 million customers in West Virginia, Virginia and Tennessee, said Friday it requested 1,700 additional workers from neighboring utilities along with sending its own crews from unaffected areas to assist with service restoration.Faith Borden, a meteorologist in the National Weather Service Nashville office, said Friday that middle Tennessee could expect ""all types of severe weather. Winds up to 70 mph. We're talking seriously large hail up to 3 inches, which for us is big hail.""Texas hit by heat wave Texas, meanwhile, faced searing heat. A heat advisory was issued for the San Antonio and Austin, with temperatures at a blistering 95 F (35 C) to 105 (40.5 C). Parts of the southern East Coast, from Virginia to Florida, battled with heat in the 90s.The National Weather Service Office for Austin/San Antonio said Friday the humidity coming in over the weekend is expected to make temperatures feel hotter.""There are concerns of heat exhaustion for people that aren't taking proper precautions when they're outdoors,"" meteorologist Jason Runyen said. He advised those affected to take breaks and stay hydrated.Overnight Thursday, storms accompanied by booming thunder, lightning displays and powerful winds swept through parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, northern Indiana and Michigan - leaving scores of trees down and thousands of homes without power.Several tornadoes touched down Thursday in central Wisconsin. None of the twisters have received ratings yet, said Timm Uhlmann , a National Weather Service meteorologist in Green Bay.""We're still gathering reports,"" Uhlmann said. ""We're assessing some of the damage and still getting video and pictures. The damage that we have is fairly widespread. There was a lot of large hail. In Eau Claire was one report of softball-sized hail.""No injuries have been reported.Surveys also were underway Friday of damage in Michigan to determine if any tornadoes touched down there, said Steven Freitag, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in White Lake Township, northwest of Detroit.The storms were fueled by temperatures in the lower 80s that stretched from Illinois into Michigan and were activated by a cold front that pushed through, Freitag said.By Friday evening, customers in Michigan were slowly seeing power return but more than 200,000 remained without it. An estimated 60,000 were without power in Indiana. Another 27,000 in total had no electricity in Illinois and Kentucky.The threat of severe weather in Chicago delayed a Beyonce concert by about two hours Thursday at Soldier Field.","NEW: The St. Louis Zoo will remain closed Saturday because of downed trees and other damage.

'When you run away you are a coward': South Africa President Ramaphosa slams Afrikaners as Trump grants them US refuge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/when-you-run-away-you-are-a-coward-south-africa-president-ramaphosa-slams-afrikaners-as-trump-grants-them-us-refuge-video/articleshow/121224783.cms,"South African President Cyril Ramaphosa (left) and US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)





Soth African President Cyril Ramaphosa has condemned a group of white Afrikaners who arrived in the United States as refugees, calling them “cowards” for fleeing the country. Speaking on Monday, Ramaphosa said those leaving were turning their backs on efforts to rebuild South Africa and avoid confronting its challenges.Speaking at an agricultural event in the Free State, Ramaphosa said those who left were abandoning their country rather than helping it move forward. “As South Africans, we are resilient. We don't run away from our problems. We must stay here and solve our problems,” he said. “That’s a real cowardly act.”Ramaphosa added that he believed those who had left would soon regret it: “I can bet you that they will be back soon because there is no country like South Africa.”The Afrikaners, a white ethnic minority descended from Dutch, German and French settlers, have been at the centre of a growing row between Washington and Pretoria. The Trump administration claims the group faces racial discrimination in South Africa, citing unproven allegations of land seizures and violence against white farmers. Rights groups have sharply criticised the move, calling it a distortion of reality and an affront to millions of refugees fleeing war and famine across the globe who have been denied entry to the US under Trump’s policies.President Trump, speaking Monday as the first batch of Afrikaner arrivals landed at Dulles International Airport in Virginia, repeated his claim that a “genocide” was taking place in South Africa. “It’s a genocide that’s taking place,” he said, offering no evidence but insisting he would raise the issue directly with Ramaphosa during their scheduled meeting at the White House on 21 May.Ramaphosa, speaking earlier in Abidjan, said he had already confronted Trump in a phone call over what he called misleading narratives. “I told him that what you are being told by those people who are opposed to transformation back in South Africa is not true,” he said. He further told reporters the Afrikaners “do not fit the definition of a refugee.”The South African government has repeatedly denied that white citizens, including Afrikaners, are subject to state-backed persecution. Officials have accused the Trump administration of using racial tensions to justify what Pretoria views as an unjustified attack on its sovereignty and transformation agenda.More than 8,000 white South Africans are believed to have expressed interest in the US relocation scheme.","Ramaphosa said those who left were abandoning their country rather than helping it move forward.

'Pakistan not in control'

What's Next for Balochistan Independence?Baloch Leader's Open Message to India & USA ! Razzak Baloch

'Balochistan is not Pakistan'





With Islamabad still reeling under the decisive blow dealt by India during Operation Sindoor, the Baloch freedom movement is taking advantage of the situation and making bold moves to break away from Pakistan.Prominent Baloch leaders, including Mir Yar Baloch, have declared independence of the 'Republic of Balochistan', appealing to India and the United Nations for recognition and support. The independence announcement, trending widely on social media, symbolises a coordinated push for sovereignty and a rejection of Pakistan's authority, with calls for international peacekeeping forces and the withdrawal of Pakistani security personnel from Balochistan.Meanwhile, Razzak Baloch, secretary general of the Baloch American Congress, has made an explosive claim that Pakistani authorities are no longer in control of vast swathes of the Baloch region.""Pakistani forces cannot even leave Quetta after dark,"" Baloch told TAG TV . He pointed out that even elected Pakistani officials have admitted to this situation, noting the military avoids patrolling from 5 pm to 5 am due to security fears.Razzak Baloch has said that Pakistan has lost control over 70–80 percent of the region.Razzak also urged global powers, especially India and the United States, to support the Baloch struggle.""If India supports us, our doors will open,” he said. He warned that delays in support would only strengthen what he described as a “barbaric army,” affecting the region’s stability.Baloch ended with a stark warning, saying it would be wiser for the Pakistani army to withdraw with dignity rather than face a situation like Bangladesh, where only their boots were left behind. He called for peace, regional stability, and an immediate end to military oppression across Pakistan’s provinces.The recent declarations are rooted in decades of grievances over military repression, enforced disappearances, and exploitation of the region's natural resources.The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), under leaders like Bashir Zaib, has intensified armed resistance, targeting Pakistani military and Chinese projects linked to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.A few days earlier, Baloch activist Mir Yar Baloch has claimed independence from Pakistan. “Balochistan is not Pakistan,” he wrote on social media, where hashtags like Republic of Balochistan trended alongside photos of proposed national flags and maps.Mir had also voiced support for India amid tensions with Pakistan and China. Referring to India’s Operation Sindoor after the Pahalgam terror attack, he said, “You are not alone, Narendra Modi. You have the backing of 60 million Baloch patriots.”Also read: 'We're not Pakistani': Baloch leader declares independence, has this request from Indians The Baloch independence movement has deep historical roots, tracing back to 1947, when the princely state of Kalat briefly declared independence following the partition of British India. In 1948, it was forcibly annexed by Pakistan, a move that Baloch nationalists have never accepted.Activists argue that Islamabad has exploited the province’s gas and mineral wealth while keeping locals in poverty. Balochistan remains Pakistan’s poorest province, with limited infrastructure and media access. Years of conflict have left a troubling record of human rights abuses, including enforced disappearances and killings.","Prominent Baloch leaders, including Mir Yar Baloch, have declared independence of the 'Republic of Balochistan' The independence announcement, trending widely on social media, symbolises a coordinated push for sovereignty and a rejection of Pakistan's authority.

Unfortunately, the fourth one hit the hangar at Bholari airbase, where one of our AWACS was standing.

From India–Pakistan ceasefire to $2 trillion deals and Qatari jet gift: 7 things Donald Trump told Fox News,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-indiapakistan-ceasefire-to-2-trillion-deals-and-qatari-jet-gifts-7-things-donald-trump-told-fox-news/articleshow/121226482.cms,"Declaring a ‘major success’ in the Gulf

Securing record-breaking Gulf investments

On India-Pakistan ceasefire

Defending the Qatar Boeing jet gift

Asserting leverage over Iran’s nuclear ambitions

On Russia–Ukraine and a Putin deal

Eyeing further foreign policy engagement





US President Donald Trump ’s recent Fox News interview covered a sweeping array of topics, ranging from the success of his Middle East tour in restoring ties with Gulf monarchies, and celebrated record-breaking investment commitments totaling an estimated $2 trillion.Trump defended accepting a 42-year-old Boeing 747-8 from Qatar as a stopgap for the delayed Air Force One fleet, contended that his sanctions policy on Iran prevented it from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and touted his role in defusing a potential nuclear showdown between India and Pakistan. He also criticised former President Biden’s handling of global affairs, expressed confidence in brokering peace between Russia and Ukraine, and hinted at further foreign trips.On wrapping up his three-nation tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates from May 13–15, Trump described the trip as “a major, major success” in strengthening US engagement with the energy-rich Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states. He said that the personal friendships with all three leaders, forged long before his presidency, arguing this familiarity translated into unprecedented goodwill.Trump criticized the Biden administration for having “coaxed” these countries towards China, asserting his visit “prevented deeper Chinese influence” in the region.""They're great people and it's a great region. But it was never treated properly and it was certainly not treated well by Biden, who didn't know he was alive, frankly. So, you know, you can understand that. But he was not. He didn't treat. They didn't treat this group well. And I think they were being. And I guess, you know, because you've reported on it, they were being coaxed very strongly by China because that solves China's fuel problem forever. And it wasn't their preference, but they were on their way. They were going to China and that was going to be their, their parent, and that's not happening,"" he said.Trump touted agreements worth over $2 trillion in commercial and defense deals, including a $600 billion investment pledge from Saudi Arabia and $243.5 billion in contracts with Qatar. “We set records. There’s never been a trip like this by any president or anybody ever before,” he boasted. He challenged the Gulf partners to “double it up,” noting their willingness to channel vast energy revenues into the US economy, a point he framed as central to revitalizing American manufacturing and mounting the Iron Dome (or, as he rebranded it, the “Golden Dome”) in the Middle East.Trump also talked about what he called “one of the biggest successes no one ever gives me credit for” calling both Indian and Pakistani leaders by phone and persuading them to “step back from the brink” of a potential nuclear clash, mere hours before his departure for the Gulf. “You had a couple of foreign policy successes,” he told Bret Baier. “You picked up the phone and called two nuclear powers, India and Pakistan, and you got them to step back from the brink. ”""Bigger success than I'll ever be given credit for that. But those are major nuclear powers. Those are not like a little bit. And they were angry. And the next phase was probably. Did you see where it was getting. It was tit for tat. It was getting deeper and more. I mean, more missiles. Every. Everyone was stronger, stronger to a point where the next ones are going to be"" he said.He mentioned the gravity of the situation, noting that “these are major nuclear powers. These are not like a little bit,” and warned that, without de-escalation, “the next phase was probably… you know what the N word is, right?” Trump then lauded his use of trade incentives as a peace-building tool: “I’m using trade to settle scores and to make peace,” he said, pledging to reduce tariffs by “100 per cent” for US exports to India once full calm was restored.Responding to controversy over Qatar’s donation of a 42-year-old Boeing 747-8 to serve temporarily as Air Force One, Trump clarified that the aircraft would belong to the US Air Force, not him personally, and pledged it would be decommissioned like Ronald Reagan’s planes at a future presidential library. He explained that Boeing had fallen “very late” in delivering the new fleet, forcing the need for an interim solution. While acknowledging bipartisan “outcry” and ethical concerns under the Foreign Emoluments Clause, he quipped, “Why wouldn’t I accept the gift? We’re giving to everybody else.” The jet in question, registration P4-HBJ, has been in service with Qatar Amiri Flight since 2012 and is valued at approximately $400 million.Turning to Iran, Trump insisted that under his sanctions regime Tehran “had no money” to bankroll proxies like Hamas or Hezbollah and was “stone cold broke” until sanctions relief under President Biden freed up over $300 billion. He claimed a nuclear deal was “close” but warned there was “not plenty of time” to finalize terms before Iran acquires a weapon. He favored a “nonviolent” resolution yet threatened that failure would force the US to consider options analogous to his secondary sanctions on Venezuela, which had crippled that country’s oil exports.On Ukraine, he lamented President Zelensky’s repeated requests for aid—“he walks out with $100 billion every time”—and criticized the Biden administration for mismanaging the war effort. He professed a personal rapport with Vladimir Putin and declared a “meeting can’t happen without me,” predicting he could secure the peace that eluded other envoys, though he admitted, “He’s not looking good.”""I think Putin is tired of this whole thing. He's not. And he's not looking good. And he wants to look good. Don't forget, this was supposed to end in one week. And if he didn't get stuck in the mud with his army tanks all over the place, they would have been in Kiev, of Kiev in about five hours,"" the US president said.Trump also suggested he was open to more foreign tours, including a potential meeting with China’s Xi Jinping. He framed his hands-on diplomacy as a “very taxing model” but insisted it had “re-emphasized American leadership” abroad. He contrasted this with the Biden presidency, which he characterized as having “weakened” US influence and allowed adversaries to “get stronger.” He pledged: to resolve the twin Middle East crises of Iran and Israel–Hamas, ensuring a “freedom zone” in Gaza and humanitarian relief for starving Palestinians.",US President Donald Trump spoke to Fox News about his Middle East tour.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump has drawn attention with his remarks praising the efficiency and affordability of Iranian drones while criticising the high costs associated with American defence manufacturers. In a recent press briefing, Trump highlighted the stark price difference between drones produced by Iran and those proposed by US companies.Speaking at a press briefing, Trump contrasted Iran’s production costs “$35,000 to $40,000” with US manufacturers quoting $41 million for comparable models.“I asked one of the companies I want a lot of drones... and in the case of Iran, they make a good drone. And it makes them for 35-40 thousand dollars,” Trump said. “So I say to this company, I wanna see... they came in 2 weeks later with a drone that cost 41 million. I said that’s not what I’m talking about.”Trump called the drones “very good too and fast and deadly,” adding, “They are horrible actually. When you look at what’s happening with Russia, a drone is killing tremendous number of people. You hide behind a tree, a drone comes down and circles you with fire. You don’t have a chance.A tree comes down also.”His remarks appeared to reference the role of loitering munitions in recent conflicts like Russia’s war in Ukraine. The comments drew attention for both their blunt assessment of modern warfare and their unusual praise for Iranian capabilities—despite longstanding tensions between Washington and Tehran.In a separate interview, Trump suggested he was open to trade negotiations with Iran , provided it does not pursue nuclear weapons.“Iran wants to trade with us… and I’m OK with that,” he said. “We make a deal, they’ll be very happy. But… they’re not going to have a nuclear weapon.”Trump also added, “I’m using trade to settle scores and to make peace.”Meanwhile, Trump signalled growing optimism over a possible nuclear deal with Iran , suggesting that an agreement may be within reach and could prevent military conflict.Speaking during his Gulf tour, Trump told reporters in Qatar: “We're not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran. I think we're getting close to maybe doing a deal without having to do this.” The remarks, which followed a meeting with the Emir of Qatar, immediately triggered a drop in global oil prices, with Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate both falling more than 3 percent.","US President Donald Trump has drawn attention with his remarks praising the efficiency and affordability of Iranian drones.

‘To easy lol’: 10 inmates including murder convicts use blankets to escape through hole in New Orleans jail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/to-easy-lol-10-inmates-including-murder-convicts-use-blankets-to-escape-through-hole-in-new-orleans-jail-watch-video/articleshow/121225921.cms,"



Ten men executed a daring escape from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans early on Friday, slipping out through a hole behind a toilet in their cell before climbing over a wall and fleeing the facility. The breakout occurred while the only guard assigned to their cell pod was absent, having left to get food. Authorities believe the escape may have been aided by insiders within the sheriff’s department, highlighting serious security failings. Above the hole, messages are scrawled, including ""To Easy LoL"" with an arrow pointing at the gap.Surveillance footage released by the sheriff’s office captured the inmates running out of the jail, some still in their orange uniforms, others in white. They climbed over a fence, using blankets to shield themselves from barbed wire, and several were seen sprinting across a nearby interstate. A photograph obtained by law enforcement showed the hole behind a toilet where the men escaped, with graffiti above it mocking the ease of their exit.The absence of the escapees went unnoticed for more than seven hours. Officials only realised something was wrong during a routine headcount at 8:30 a.m.that morning. No deputy was physically present in the cell pod at the time; a civilian technician assigned to observe the area had stepped away for food, unaware of the breakout. Sheriff Susan Hutson blamed defective locks for the breach, explaining she had repeatedly warned officials about the failing infrastructure and recently pushed for funding to fix the locks. She also confirmed there are strong indications that the inmates received assistance from within the department. “It’s almost impossible for anybody to get out of this facility without help,” she said.Once out, the men shed their jail uniforms, though it remains unclear how some acquired civilian clothes so quickly. Ten men escaped, though initial reports that 11 fled were corrected when one man was found to be housed in a different cell.Two of the fugitives have since been caught. Kendall Myles, 20, was arrested after a brief chase through the French Quarter, hiding beneath a car in a hotel garage. He had previously escaped twice from juvenile detention centres. Robert Moody was captured later that day following a tip to Crimestoppers.The eight remaining men are considered armed and dangerous. Several face serious charges, including second-degree murder. Among them is Derrick Groves, convicted last year for Mardi Gras Day shootings in 2018, and Corey Boyd, who had pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder.The escape has drawn sharp criticism from local and state officials. Orleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams condemned the delayed public notification, saying the failure endangered lives. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill called the escape “beyond unacceptable” and warned the fugitives could be anywhere across the country by now.New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick described a “full court effort” to track down the escapees and protect potential witnesses, with at least one family already relocated for safety. She also warned anyone harbouring the fugitives would face prosecution.The Orleans Justice Center has struggled for years with understaffing and outdated facilities. Sheriff Hutson said staffing is at around 60% capacity, and the office lacks funds for maintenance contracts to repair doors and locks. Federal monitoring and court orders have sought to improve conditions, but security lapses have persisted, culminating in this alarming breakout.","Ten men escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans. They slipped out through a hole behind a toilet in their cell before climbing over a wall. The only guard assigned to their cell pod was absent, having left to get food. Authorities believe the escape may have been aided by insiders within the sheriff’s department.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121225922,imgsize-798874,width-400,resizemode-4/121225922.jpg"
'Bad and dangerous day for America': Trump blasts SC verdict on Venezuelan deportations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bad-and-dangerous-day-for-america-trump-blasts-sc-verdict-on-venezuelan-deportations/articleshow/121225760.cms,"(File photo)





The US Supreme Court has blocked President Donald Trump’s effort to quickly resume deportations of Venezuelan migrants, dealing a fresh blow to his administration’s immigration agenda. The justices ruled against the use of a rarely invoked 1798 wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act , which the Trump administration sought to apply to alleged members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang . This law would have allowed the government to deport individuals without following the usual legal procedures.The court’s decision came in a 7-2 vote on Friday, indefinitely halting the deportations from a detention centre in north Texas and sending the case back to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The justices ruled that detainees must be given more time to legally challenge their removal, finding that the administration’s notice period of roughly 24 hours was insufficient. The unsigned opinion stressed that the court was not deciding on the legality of using the Alien Enemies Act itself, only on the requirement for due process protections.Trump responded immediately on his Truth Social platform, blasting the decision.He wrote, “THE SUPREME COURT WON'T ALLOW US TO GET CRIMINALS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY!” He criticised the ruling, saying it prevents the forced removal of “the worst murderers, drug dealers, gang members, and even those who are mentally insane, who came into our Country illegally.”According to Trump, the court’s ruling “will let more CRIMINALS pour into our Country, doing great harm to our cherished American public” and will encourage “other criminals to illegally enter our Country, wreaking havoc and bedlam wherever they go.” He accused President Joe Biden of allowing “MILLIONS of Criminal Aliens” to enter without any legal process and lamented that his own administration is now bound by “a long and extended PROCESS” to deport them. Trump expressed appreciation for Justices Alito and Thomas, who dissented, thanking them for “attempting to protect our Country,” but called the ruling “a bad and dangerous day for America.”The Supreme Court’s intervention follows a string of legal setbacks for the Trump administration’s efforts to accelerate deportations. The government has labelled members of the Tren de Aragua gang as foreign terrorists and has sought to deport them rapidly under the Alien Enemies Act, bypassing normal immigration procedures. However, several federal judges have pushed back, ruling that the administration’s use of the centuries-old law is improper.The court emphasised that national security concerns must be balanced with constitutional protections, recognising “the necessity that such interests be pursued in a manner consistent with the Constitution.” The ruling makes clear that while the government can still pursue deportations, it must allow detainees reasonable time to contest their removal. This remains a complicated legal patchwork, with various courts issuing differing orders on how and when deportations under the law can proceed.Justices Alito and Thomas dissented, with Alito sharply criticising the majority for intervening without awaiting further review from lower courts. Justice Brett Kavanaugh agreed with the majority but expressed a preference for a quicker, definitive ruling from the Supreme Court rather than sending the case back to the appeals court.","The US Supreme Court has blocked President Donald Trump’s effort to quickly resume deportations of Venezuelan migrants.

Biden leaked interview with Robert Hur shows his memory lapse: Here's what it says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-leaked-interview-with-robert-hur-shows-his-memory-lapse-heres-what-it-says/articleshow/121225600.cms,"File photo: Former US President Joe Biden (Picture credit: AP)

Here's the transcript of the leaked audio:





Newly released audio of President Joe Biden’s 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur showed what had previously been only suggested in transcripts that Biden frequently struggled with memory lapses, including key details such as when his son Beau died and the year Donald Trump was elected. The recordings, made public Friday, offer a rare and unfiltered glimpse into the president’s state of mind during a high-stakes federal investigation and have reignited questions about his mental acuity, which the White House has long sought to downplay.In the six-hour conversation, split across two sessions in October 2023, Biden appears at times lost, slow to respond, and unsure of significant facts. The audio captures long pauses, soft muttering, and moments when his legal team had to assist him in recalling major life events. At one point, Biden struggled to recall that his son Beau died in 2015, requiring prompting from his lawyers. In another instance, he asked for confirmation of when Trump was elected. The backdrop of the interview, the steady tick of a grandfather clock in the Map Room, underscores the president’s halting speech and difficulty in staying on track.While the transcript of the interview had already raised concerns when it was released earlier this year, the audio gives texture to the president’s performance his whispering, his distracted recollections, and the evident reliance on his attorneys.One exchange captures Biden saying, “In 2017, Beau had passed,” only for his counsel to gently correct him, reminding him that Beau died in 2015. Another moment features Biden failing to recall telling his ghostwriter, “I just found all the classified stuff downstairs,” despite a 2017 recording in which he had clearly said it. “I don’t remember,” he replied. “And I’m not supposed to speculate, right?”The release of the audio follows months of Democratic infighting and renewed scrutiny over whether Biden should have pursued a second term. His withdrawal from the 2024 race came after a poor debate performance and rising pressure from party leaders. Though Vice President Kamala Harris ultimately lost to Donald Trump, a forthcoming book Original Sin by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson — claims that Biden’s closest aides shielded his physical and cognitive decline from the public eye during the campaign.Robert Hur’s report ultimately concluded that Biden, despite his mishandling of classified documents, should not face criminal charges. The reason? His age and forgetfulness would likely make a jury view him as a “sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”Robert Hur: So during this time we were living in Chambers Road and there were documents related to the Penn Biden center or the Biden cancer bone shot or your book. Where did you keep papers that related to those things that you were actively working on?Biden: Well, I-I-I-I don't know. This is 2017, 18, that period. Remember, in this time frame, my son is either been deployed or is dying. And. And so if it was. And by the way, there were still a lot of people at the time when I got out of the Senate that encouraging me to run in this period except the President. I'm not. Not a mean thing to say. I mean he just thought that she had a better shot of winning the presidency than I did. And so I hadn't. I hadn't at this point, even though I'm at Penn, I hadn't walked away from the idea that I might run for office again. If I ran again, I'd be running for president. And so what was happening though? When did Bo die? May 30th. Was it 2015 he died. I'm not sure the months are. But I think that was. Yeah, that's right, Mr. President. And what's happened in the meantime is that as. And Trump gets elected in November of 2017. 16. 2016. All right, so that's when you left office in January of 2017. Okay, that's a chunk. Is sworn in January, right? Correct. Okay. Yeah, correct. And in 2017, Beau had passed. And this is personal the genesis of the book and the title. Promise me dad was a. I know you're all close with your sons and daughters, but Bo was like my right arm and that was my left. These guys were a year and a day apart and they could finish each other's sentences. Bo. I used to go home on the train in my period that I was still in the Senate. Anyway. Excuse me. There was pressure. Not pressure. Bo knew how much I adored him. And this sounds. Maybe this sounds. So everybody knew how closer word there was not anybody in the world wonder whether or not. Anyway.","Newly released audio of President Joe Biden’s 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur showed what had previously been only suggested in transcripts.

Leaked audio shows Joe Biden’s memory lapses during special counsel interview,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/leaked-audios-confirm-joe-bidens-memory-lapses-during-special-counsel-interview/articleshow/121224500.cms,"



Newly released audio recordings from President Joe Biden’s October 2023 interviews with Special Counsel Robert Hur have revealed troubling lapses in memory, casting renewed scrutiny over his mental acuity during his time in office. The recordings, obtained by Axios, show the president repeatedly struggling to recall basic details including when his son Beau died, the year Donald Trump was elected, and how classified documents came into his possession.The six hours of interviews were part of Hur’s investigation into Biden’s handling of classified materials found at his home and former office. Although Biden ultimately faced no criminal charges, Hur concluded in his February 2024 report that prosecuting the president would likely fail due to his advanced age and cognitive difficulties. The audio now publicly confirms what the transcript alone could not: long silences, slurred words, and a former president frequently relying on his lawyers to fill in memory gaps.In one moment, Biden appeared to forget when Beau died, only recalling it after prompting from his legal team. As he tried to discuss his book Promise Me, Dad, the recording captured a ticking grandfather clock in the background accentuating the extended pauses in his speech.Biden’s lawyers frequently stepped in to assist, supplying words or correcting dates. At one point, Biden seemed unsure why he had kept a classified memo about Afghanistan, vaguely suggesting it might have been “for posterity’s sake” a remark quickly walked back by his attorney, who insisted Biden could not recall intentionally retaining the document.Though parts of the interview revealed moments of warmth and even humour with Biden reminiscing about bow-hunting in Mongolia and driving his Corvette with Jay Leno the overall tone raised concerns. While he remained generally engaged, he often meandered off-topic, requiring gentle redirection from Special Counsel Hur and his team.The White House had resisted releasing the audio for months, claiming it could be misused by political opponents. Republicans, however, pushed aggressively for its release, with some accusing Attorney General Merrick Garland of shielding Biden from further scrutiny. After Garland only released the transcripts, House Republicans held him in contempt of Congress, and legal challenges from news organisations followed. The matter was still in court when Biden left office.","Newly released audio recordings from President Joe Biden’s October 2023 interviews with Special Counsel Robert Hur have revealed troubling lapses in memory.

Pakistan envoy honeytrapped in Bangladesh? Sudden exit after viral videos sparks row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-envoy-honeytrapped-in-bangladesh-sudden-exit-after-viral-videos-sparks-row/articleshow/121164452.cms,"



Pakistan’s high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof , has abruptly gone on leave after videos of his alleged honeytrap surfaced online, according to Bangladeshi daily Prothom Alo.Maroof left Dhaka on the morning of 11 May, travelling to Islamabad via Dubai. That same day, the Pakistan high commission in Dhaka formally notified Bangladesh’s ministry of foreign affairs of his departure, a senior ministry official told Prothom Alo on Tuesday.Diplomatic sources in Dhaka suggest that Maroof’s recall may be linked to controversy surrounding a personal visit to Cox’s Bazar during the recent India-Pakistan conflict, and his alleged association with a female Bangladeshi government official, Daily Sun reported.Under diplomatic protocol, when an ambassador takes leave, the host country’s foreign ministry is informed of the duration and who will assume responsibilities in the interim. While the Pakistan high commission confirmed that deputy high commissioner Muhammad Asif will serve as acting high commissioner, no timeframe for Maroof’s leave was provided in official communication, Prothom Alo noted.Maroof had played a high-profile role in Dhaka and Islamabad ties, particularly following the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government on 5 August 2024, in the wake of a student-led uprising.Rumours of the scandal escalated after photos and alleged intimate videos surfaced online, showing Maroof with a Bangladeshi woman. This also led to speculation that the envoy had been honey-trapped.","Pakistan’s high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof, has abruptly gone on leave after videos of his alleged honeytrap surfaced online.

"Pakistan's game: Harbour terrorists, stage captures & gain favours from US",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-game-harbour-terrorists-stage-captures-gain-favours-from-us/articleshow/121147957.cms,"Representative image





NEW DELHI: Early in March, the US arrested in Afghanistan an ISIS-K operative involved in the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 Marines. President Donald Trump was quick to thank Pakistan for its help in nabbing the high-value fugitive from the Pak-Afghan border. ""I want to thank the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster,"" he told US Congress.But what was brushed under the carpet was an open secret in intelligence circles: The operative, Sharifullah, had been in Pakistan spy agency ISI's custody for over a year. ISI ran multiple operations using his network and ultimately handed him over to the CIA at the right time - when the regime changed in Washington.This was not the first instance of Pakistan trying to please the US by handing over terrorists that it had been using to achieve its own goals. ISI had played the same trick in 2010 when it 'suddenly discovered' Taliban military commander Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and handed him over to CIA.The case of Osama bin Laden and his courier, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, further exposed the duplicity of Pakistan and its military-industrial complex. Pakistani intelligence agencies had claimed they had no knowledge of Osama's presence in Abbottabad despite the compound where he was staying being just about a kilometre away from the Pakistan Military Academy.The Americans, it appears, didn't believe the Pakistanis and kept on hunting for the 9/11 plotter.But while his capture and killing vindicated the US's lack of trust in Islamabad, American leaders continued to allow themselves to be baited by the Pakistanis. Trump, who considers himself to be the greatest deal maker, seems to be the latest victim of Pakistan's dual game, feeling beholden to the favour that ISI did by offering Sharifullah as a trophy.Sharifullah and Osama are not standalone cases. In 2002, a bombing at nightclubs in Bali had left over 200 people dead, including several Americans. The prime suspect was Umar Patek, a suspected member of the militant group Jemaah Islamiyah. The US had announced a $1 million bounty on him.On January 25, 2011, Patek was dramatically captured by Pakistani officials in Abbottabad and handed over to the US, which then passed him on to Indonesia as a gesture which ""demonstrated the international cooperation between the US and Indonesia in addressing terrorism"". Pakistan had similarly arrested Osama's man Friday Abu Zubaydah in Faisalabad six months after the 9/11 attacks. He was swiftly transferred to CIA custody.These capture-extraditions, though seen as attempts by Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to counter-terrorism, have actually been selective and strategic, aimed at appeasing the US rather than genuinely combating terrorism, a senior officer said.","US arrested in Afghanistan an ISIS-K operative involved in the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 Marines.

Poll Do you think military retaliation is an effective solution to cross-border terrorism? Yes, it sends a strong message No, it leads to further escalation





NEW DELHI: India’s decisive military action under Operation Sindoor resulted in 11 Pakistani military personnel killed and 78 injured, Pakistan confirmed on Tuesday.The casualties occurred during India’s major counterterrorism strike in a strong retaliatory action of Pahalgam terroar attack codenamed, Operation Sindoor, launched on May 7. As part of the offensive, Indian armed forces carried out precision strikes on nine terror launchpads, including major hubs of Jaish-e-Mohammad in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke.In retaliation, Pakistan launched a series of drone incursions into Indian airspace over subsequent nights. These drones were in a quick response were intercepted and neutralised by India's air defence systems.After Pak's incursion, India escalated its response, targeting and reportedly destroying key Pakistani military and air infrastructure, including the Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi and the Rahim Yar Khan airbase.Although both countries reached an understanding to end hostilities on Saturday, an initiative that reportedly came from Islamabad, the ceasefire was short-lived. Pakistan violated the agreement within hours of talks between the Director Generals of Military Operations (DGMOs) from both sides.The Pakistan military released names of several personnel killed in the strikes. Among the Pakistan air force casualties were Squadron Leader Usman Yousuf, Chief Technician Aurangzeb, Senior Technician Najeeb, Corporal Technician Farooq, and Senior Technician Mubashir.Pakistan army fatalities included Naik Abdul Rehman, Lance Naik Dilawar Khan, Lance Naik Ikramullah, Naik Waqar Khalid, Sepoy Muhammad Adeel Akbar, and Sepoy Nisar.","India's decisive military action under Operation Sindoor resulted in 11 Pakistani military personnel killed and 78 injured, Pakistan confirmed on Tuesday.

Pakistan’s ‘innocent preacher’ is actually a global terrorist,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-innocent-preacher-is-actually-a-global-terrorist/articleshow/121123757.cms,"Pakistan had claimed that the man leading the prayers was Abdul Rauf (circled), a preacher and member of Pakistan Markazi Muslim League. But it turns out that he was actually Hafiz Abdul Rauf — a ‘specially designated global terrorist’ by the US who is also on SDN (Specially Designated Nationals) list of the US govt (AFP photo)





Pakistan’s misinformation campaign was exposed yet again after its claim that the man leading funeral prayers for terrorists was an innocent preacher turned out to be blatant lie and the man in question was identified as a designated global terrorist During a press conference, Pakistan’s DG-ISPR (Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations) had flashed the national ID card of a man with a similar name, Abdul Rauf, claiming that he was a preacher and a member of the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League (PMML) party.However, details from the same bio-data exposed the intricate web of misinformation spun by the ISI. It turned out that Abdul Rauf was not a preacher or Masood Azhar’s slain brother with the same name but a different individual with ties to Lashkar-eTaiba. The man, Hafiz Abdul Rauf , is a ‘specially designated global terrorist’ (SDGT) by the US department of treasury and is also on the SDN (Specially Designated Nationals) list of the US government.Pakistan’s lies were busted from their computerised national identity card (CNIC) number visible in the document flashed by DG ISPR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif. The number 35202-5400413-9 on the document is the same as the one listed by the US treasury and the Office of Foreign Assets Control which incidentally also lists Lt Gen Sharif’s father, Mahmood Sultan Bashiruddin, as a designated terrorist with ties to al-Qaida.In the press conference held by DG ISPR during Operation Sidoor, a Pakistan Air Force officer also claimed to have shown “tactical brilliance” in Pulwama, which is being interpreted as an acknowledgement of the Pakistani military’s role in the 2019 Pulwama terror attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel.They then went on to allege that India’s claims of Abdul Rauf being a terrorist were not true.Incidentally, the same photograph of Abdul Rauf at the burial was used by India to identify and release the names of senior Pakistan army personnel and key police officials who attended the funeral of terrorists — including high-ranking officers such as Lt Gen Fayyaz Hussain Shah and Inspector General of Police Usman Anwar.According to the US treasury department, Hafiz Abdul Rauf, a member of LeT’s senior leadership since 1999, is the chief of Falah-i-Insaniat Foundation, operating LeT’s relief activities in disguise.","Pakistan had claimed that the man leading the prayers was Abdul Rauf, a preacher and member of Pakistan Markazi Muslim League.
