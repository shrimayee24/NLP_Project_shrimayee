"Purohit says framed by Karkare, PBS & then govt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/purohit-says-framed-by-karkare-pbs-then-govt/articleshow/109958895.cms,"MUMBAI: In his final statement in the 2008 Malegaon blast trial in the special NIA court, accused Lt Col Prasad Purohit has said that all the police officers who carried out what he called the ""fabricated, orchestrated and concocted"" investigation - on the orders of Hemant Karkare (then ATS chief), Param Bir Singh (then joint commissioner of ATS), and Mohan Kulkarni (then ACP-ATS and investigating officer) - were part of a conspiracy hatched by the senior officers to suit the political requirements of the government of the day at the Centre and the state.A Congress-led govt was in office at the Centre and state when Purohit was arrested in 2008. He said that in Aug 2008, the president of a political party spoke about the existence of Hindu terrorists and the term 'Hindu terror' was coined. The coinage was immediately followed by the blast on Sept 29. The statement said these officers fabricated and planted evidence and were involved in the extra-judicial killings of wanted accused Ramchandra Kalsangra and Sandeep Dange and a witness.Purohit said that with witnesses turning hostile and bringing out the fact that they were tortured to extract statements as required by ATS and or their political masters, it was clear that the whole case against him was a ""concocted lie"". He said the officers had compromised national security, demoralised intelligence officers and permanently harmed Army's reputation.Purohit said that during his time as an intelligence officer, he initiated reports regarding ""fugitive terror accused and ISI agent"" Dawood Ibrahim, proclaimed fugitive Dr Ganapati of CPI (Maoist) and now-proclaimed fugitive Zakir Naik and illegal funding of his organisation.""The meeting was to streamline the arms, ammunition, war-like stores and drug supply from ISI, Pakistan, to left-wing extremists and Naxalites in Dandakaranya special committee xone operating in entire penninsular India, especially after these supplies stopped getting into India from Nepal,"" Purohit said.He said he was treated worse than a prisoner of war. Karkare and Singh insisted that he should own up to ""his role"" and name functionaries of RSS and VHP, and Yogi Adityanath, the then MP from Gorakhpur, UP, Purohit said.He claimed that while he was asked to leave a certain place on Nov 3, 2008, an ATS officer secretly requested him not to as there were orders to kill him the moment he got out of the premises. He said that the planting of RDX was carried out on the same day at co-accused Sudhakar Chaturvedi's home. He said he was brought to the city and ""brutally"" tortured after he was kept suspended by a rope tied to his wrist.Purohit claimed that both the ATS and NIA, the first and second agency to investigate the case, respectively, did not go through the relevant documents to reaffirm that his actions were in the line of his duty and his superiors were kept informed all the time. He said that they instead kept the investigation limited to suit their ulterior motives to implicate him to destroy the intelligence apparatus operating in Southern Command.Purohit alleged that Pakistan left no opportunity to equate the army, which he said was the finest in the world, with the rogue army of their own country. He said that Pakistan President Gen Parvez Musharraf went on to ask for his custody in the Samjhauta Express blast case, thanks to the ATS, which purportedly claimed that the explosives were provided by him.","Lt Col Prasad Purohit says all the police officers who carried out what he called the ""fabricated, orchestrated and concocted"" investigation were part of a conspiracy hatched by the senior officers.

BERLIN: German police on Wednesday arrested a 74-year-old man suspected of hitting a former mayor of Berlin in the head, the latest in a rash of assaults against politicians in Germany .Chancellor Olaf Scholz blasted the attacks against politicians as ""outrageous and cowardly"", stressing that violence did not belong in a democratic debate.Franziska Giffey was at a library on Tuesday afternoon when the suspect came up from behind her to hit her in the head and neck with a bag containing hard objects, police said.Giffey, who is now Berlin state's economy minister and a member of Scholz's Social Democratic Party ( SPD ), was treated in hospital for light injuries.The detained suspect was previously known to investigators over ""state security and hate crimes"", said police, adding that they were investigating the motive of the attack .Prosecutors on Wednesday evening said on X that the suspect had been admitted to a psychiatric ward.According to provisional police figures, 2,790 crimes were committed against politicians in Germany in 2023, up from 1,806 the previous year.Nevertheless, that was down from the 2,840 recorded in 2021, when the last general elections were held.Giffey said she was feeling well after the initial scare.But she was ""concerned and shaken about a growing 'free wild culture' in which people who are engaging politically in our country are increasingly exposed to attacks that are supposedly justified and acceptable.""We live in a free and democratic country, in which everyone can be free to express his or her opinions,"" she wrote on X.""But there is a clear line -- and that is violence against people,"" she added.Berlin's current mayor Kai Wegner said anyone who attacked politicians was ""attacking our democracy"", as he vowed to examine ""tougher sentences for attacks against politicians"".Politicians, particularly from Scholz's SPD or coalition partner the Greens, have found themselves under increasing attacks in recent months.Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the Greens was stopped from disembarking from a ferry by a group of protesters earlier this year.Another prominent Green politician Katrin Goering-Eckardt was blocked from leaving an event in the state of Brandenburg last week by demonstrators who surrounded her car and started hitting it.Giffey's assault also came just days after a European member of parliament, likewise from the SPD, had to be hospitalised last week after four people attacked him as he put up EU election posters in the eastern city of Dresden.Matthias Ecke, 41, needed an operation for serious injuries suffered in the attack, which Scholz denounced as a threat to democracy. Four suspects, aged between 17 and 18, were being investigated over the incident.All four were believed to have links to the far-right group known as ""Elblandrevolte"", according to German media.Dresden has been a hotspot for assaults against politicians, with another case reported on Tuesday.A politician, identified by police only as a 47-year-old from the Green party, was threatened and spat on.She was putting up campaign posters for the European elections when a man came up, pushed her to the side and tore down two posters.He insulted and threatened the politician, while a woman joined in and spat on the victim, police said.Officers arrested both suspects, police added, identifying them as a 34-year-old German man and a 24-year-old woman.Both were in a group standing at the area and who had begun making the banned Hitler salute when the politician began putting up the posters.","German police arrest a 74-year-old man suspected of hitting a former mayor in the head.

At the request of the province and after public and political backlash, people in the province are no longer permitted to use drugs in public places.Under the changes, which went into effect immediately, adults will still be allowed to possess small amounts of drugs.But they will now have to use them in legal residences, at safe injection sites and at other harm reduction centres established by health authorities. The recriminalisation of public drug use in British Columbia underscores the difficulties that govts face as they grapple with the opioid crisis. Even in a province that has been a global pioneer of the harm reduction movement, an approach that seeks to reduce risky behaviour rather than to punish drug users, there are no easy answers. The province's coroner estimated that there were a record 2,511 toxic drug deaths last year. The goals of decriminalising possession were to enable police officers to focus their time on large drug distributors rather than users and encourage users to be open to treatment.","Canada govt on Tuesday walked back part of a programme allowing people in British Columbia to possess small amounts of drugs.

The US and others have long worried that the new pier at the Ream Naval Base, built with Chinese funding, could serve as a new outpost for the Chinese navy on the Gulf of Thailand, but Cambodia has said that would not happen. Asked about why the two ships had been there for five months, defence ministry spokesperson Gen Chhum Socheat said they were due to take part in a joint Cambodian-Chinese military exercise later this month, and that they were also involved in training Cambodian sailors. ""We have been clear that Cambodia is not allowing any foreign forces to be deployed on its territory,"" he said.He said the ships were also ""testing"" the new pier, and that they were on show for Cambodia, which was considering purchasing similar warships for its own navy. ""The ships are docked for the training period only, they are not staying permanently.""Controversy over Ream Naval Base initially arose in 2019 when Wall Street Journal reported that an early draft of an agreement would allow China 30-year use of the base, where it would be able to post military personnel, store weapons and berth warships.

NEW DELHI: The trial of Kazakhstan’s former economy minister Kuandyk Bishimbayev for the murder of his wife, Saltanat Nukenova, has shocked the nation, with thousands calling for harsher penalties for domestic violence .CCTV footage depicted the minister dragging his wife by her hair, and subsequently punching and kicking her. Following the recorded incident, Nukenova succumbed to brain trauma.The footage, spanning eight hours, also captured Bishimbayev breaking down a door as Nukenova attempted to seek refuge in a bathroom.Nukenova, aged 31, was discovered dead in November within a restaurant owned by one of Bishimbayev’s relatives. Initially denying involvement, Bishimbayev confessed in court on Wednesday to assaulting her and inadvertently causing her demise.Bishimbayev's legal team contested medical evidence suggesting Nukenova died from repeated head trauma . They attempted to portray her as prone to jealousy and violence, despite no evidence from the restaurant's security cameras showing her attacking Bishimbayev.Bishimbayev, 44 years old, once celebrated as a modern, Western-educated figure within the Kazakhstani government under former leader Nursultan Nazarbayev, was incarcerated for bribery in 2018. He was later granted a pardon, less than two years into his sentence.A 2018 study supported by UN Women revealed approximately 400 women in Kazakhstan die annually due to domestic violence, with many cases going unreported.In 2017, Kazakhstan decriminalized certain forms of domestic violence, categorizing them as causing ""minor"" physical damage, punishable by fines or brief imprisonment. This move mirrored Russia's actions that year, provoking outrage among advocates for women’s rights. Kazakhstan has since reversed this legislation, intensifying penalties for offenders and introducing new criminal charges, including harassment of minors.","Kuandyk Bishimbayev is on trial for the murder of his wife, Saltanat Nukenova.

Vladimir Putin: 'Leading Russia a sacred duty': Putin takes oath for record fifth presidential term,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/russian-president-vladidmir-purin-officially-begins-his-fifth-term/articleshow/109914444.cms,"NEW DELHI: Vladimir Putin took oath for a new term of five years as the president of Russia in a lavish Kremlin inauguration ceremony on Tuesday. Meanwhile, his critics said that he has eliminated his political rivals, initiated a devastating conflict in Ukraine, and consolidated all power under his control.He began his fifth term in a ceremony that was boycotted by the United States and many Western countries due to Russia's war on Ukraine.Putin, who has been in office for nearly 25 years since 1999 and is the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Josef Stalin, will remain in power at least until 2030, with the option to run for another six years as per the constitution of Russia.During the inauguration ceremony, Putin told officials that leading Russia is a ""sacred duty"", and that Russia will emerge ""stronger"" after ""difficult"" period.""We will pass through this difficult period with dignity and become even stronger,"" Putin said, adding: ""We are a united and great nation, and together we will overcome all obstacles, realise everything we have planned, and together, we will win.""In a short speech, Putin also said that Russia was open to developing relations with other countries he described as ""the world's majority"".""Russia's state system must be resistant to any threats and challenges,"" he said.Russia has transformed from a nation recovering from economic collapse to a pariah state that poses a threat to global security under Putin's leadership. Following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which has become Europe's largest conflict since World War II, Russia has faced severe sanctions from the West and is turning to other regimes like China, Iran, and North Korea for support.The main concern now is what the 71-year-old Putin will do over the next six years, both domestically and internationally. Russian forces are making progress in Ukraine, employing scorched-earth tactics as Kyiv struggles with shortages of men and ammunition.

Explainer: Why US is stopping some bomb shipments to Israel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explainer-why-us-is-stopping-some-bomb-shipments-to-israel/articleshow/109964243.cms,"What specific types of weapons has the US blocked from being sent to Israel?

Why is the US blocking these bombs now?

What was Israel's response to the US decision?

Has the US ever withheld military aid from Israel before?

American President Joe Biden has warned that the US would not provide offensive weapons to Israel for a potential full-scale assault on Rafah, a critical Hamas stronghold in Gaza. In an interview with CNN, Biden affirmed the US's commitment to Israel's defense by continuing to supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive equipment. However, he made it clear that if Israeli forces were to enter Rafah, the US would withhold supplying weapons and artillery shells.Biden reiterated the conditional nature of US military support: ""I made it clear that if they go into Rafah — they haven’t gone in Rafah yet — if they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, that deal with that problem."" Biden's stance marks a significant policy shift, emphasizing a strategic withdrawal from supporting offensive operations in such densely populated areas, saying, ""We’re not walking away from Israel’s security.We’re walking away from Israel’s ability to wage war in those areas.""Here is all you need to know about why the US is stopping some bomb shipments to IsraelThe US has paused a shipment that includes 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs. These are significant because their use in densely populated areas like Rafah can lead to high civilian casualties. President Biden expressed this concern clearly: “Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers.""The decision comes amidst escalating violence in Gaza, particularly in Rafah, where the potential for civilian casualties is substantial due to the dense population. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin stated, ""We've been very clear...from the very beginning that Israel shouldn't launch a major attack into Rafah without accounting for and protecting the civilians that are in that battlespace."" The concern is that the large bombs could cause excessive damage and civilian deaths in such settings.Israel's US ambassador, Gilad Erdan, described the US decision to pause the bomb shipment as ""very disappointing,"" even frustrating, suggesting it might be a result of political pressure on Biden. Despite this, Erdan expressed confidence that the US would not completely stop supplying arms to Israel.Yes, there have been instances in the past where the US has withheld military aid from Israel. For example, in 1982, President Ronald Reagan imposed a six-year ban on cluster weapons sales to Israel following reports that they were used in populated areas during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Such decisions are often influenced by concerns over the use of US supplied weapons in conflict zones and their impact on civilian populations.(With inputs from agencies)","US President Joe Biden has warned that the US would not provide offensive weapons to Israel for a potential full-scale assault on Rafah, a critical Hamas stronghold in Gaza.

"Biden says US won't supply weapons for Israel to attack Rafah, in warning to ally",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-says-us-wont-supply-weapons-for-israel-to-attack-rafah-in-warning-to-ally/articleshow/109960538.cms,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden said Wednesday that he would not supply offensive weapons that Israel could use to launch an all-out assault on Rafah — the last major Hamas stronghold in Gaza over concern for the well-being of the more than 1 million civilians sheltering there.Biden, in an interview with CNN, said the US was still committed to Israel's defense and would supply Iron Dome rocket interceptors and other defensive arms, but that if Israel goes into Rafah, “we’re not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells used.”The US has historically provided enormous amounts of military aid to Israel.That has only accelerated in the aftermath of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack that killed some 1,200 in Israel and led to about 250 being taken captive by militants. Biden's comments and his decision last week to pause a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel are the most striking manifestations of the growing daylight between his administration and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. Biden has said that Israel needs to do far more to protect the lives of civilians in Gaza.The shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound (900-kilogram) bombs and 1,700 500-pound (225-kilogram) bombs, according to a senior US administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. The focus of US concern was the larger explosives and how they could be used in a dense urban.“Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers,"" Biden told CNN. “I made it clear that if they go into Rafah — they haven’t gone in Rafah yet — if they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, that deal with that problem.”Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin earlier Wednesday confirmed the weapons delay, telling the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on defense that the US paused “one shipment of high payload munitions.”“We’re going to continue to do what’s necessary to ensure that Israel has the means to defend itself,” Austin said. “But that said, we are currently reviewing some near-term security assistance shipments in the context of unfolding events in Rafah.”It also comes as the Biden administration is due to deliver a first-of-its-kind formal verdict this week on whether the airstrikes on Gaza and restrictions on delivery of aid have violated international and US laws designed to spare civilians from the worst horrors of war. A decision against Israel would further add to pressure on Biden to curb the flow of weapons and money to Israel’s military.Biden signed off on the pause in an order conveyed last week to the Pentagon, according to US officials who were not authorized to comment on the matter. The White House National Security Council sought to keep the decision out of the public eye for several days until it had a better understanding of the scope of Israel’s intensified military operations in Rafah and until Biden could deliver a long-planned speech on Tuesday to mark Holocaust Remembrance Day.Biden’s administration in April began reviewing future transfers of military assistance as Netanyahu’s government appeared to move closer toward an invasion of Rafah, despite months of opposition from the White House. The official said the decision to pause the shipment was made last week and no final decision had been made yet on whether to proceed with the shipment at a later date.US officials had declined for days to comment on the halted transfer, word of which came as Biden on Tuesday described US support for Israel as “ironclad, even when we disagree.”Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, in an interview with Israeli Channel 12 TV news, said the decision to pause the shipment was “a very disappointing decision, even frustrating."" He suggested the move stemmed from political pressure on Biden from Congress, the US campus protests and the upcoming election.The decision also drew a sharp rebuke from House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who said they only learned about the military aid holdup from press reports, despite assurances from the Biden administration that no such pauses were in the works. The Republicans called on Biden in a letter to swiftly end the blockage, saying it “risks emboldening Israel's enemies,” and to brief lawmakers on the nature of the policy reviews.Biden has faced pressure from some on the left — and condemnation from the critics on the right who say Biden has moderated his support for an essential Mideast ally.“If we stop weapons necessary to destroy the enemies of the state of Israel at a time of great peril, we will pay a price,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., his voice rising in anger during an exchange with Austin. “This is obscene. It is absurd. Give Israel what they need to fight the war they can’t afford to lose.”Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Biden ally, said in a statement the pause on big bombs must be a “first step.”“Our leverage is clear,” Sanders said. “Over the years, the United States has provided tens of billions of dollars in military aid to Israel. We can no longer be complicit in Netanyahu’s horrific war against the Palestinian people.”Austin, meanwhile, told lawmakers that ""it’s about having the right kinds of weapons for the task at hand.”""A small diameter bomb, which is a precision weapon, that’s very useful in a dense, built-up environment,” he said, “but maybe not so much a 2,000-pound bomb that could create a lot of collateral damage.” He said the US wants to see Israel do “more precise” operations.Israeli troops on Tuesday seized control of Gaza’s vital Rafah border crossing in what the White House described as a limited operation that stopped short of the full-on Israeli invasion of the city that Biden has repeatedly warned against on humanitarian grounds, most recently in a Monday call with Netanyahu.Israel has ordered the evacuation of 100,000 Palestinians from the city. Israeli forces have also carried out what it describes as “targeted strikes” on the eastern part of Rafah and captured the Rafah crossing, a critical conduit for the flow of humanitarian aid along the Gaza-Egypt border.Privately, concern has mounted inside the White House about what’s unfolding in Rafah, but publicly administration officials have stressed that they did not think the operations had defied Biden’s warnings against a widescale operation in the city.The State Department is separately considering whether to approve the continued transfer of Joint Direct Attack Munition kits, which place precision guidance systems onto bombs, to Israel, but the review didn’t pertain to imminent shipments.Itamar Yaar, former deputy head of Israel’s National Security Council said the US move is largely symbolic, but a sign of trouble and could become more of a problem if it is sustained.“It’s not some kind of American embargo on American munitions support, but I think its some kind of diplomatic message to Mr. Netanyahu that he needs to take into consideration American interests more than he has over the last few months,"" he said. ""At least for now it will not impact Israeli capability but it’s some kind of a signal, a ‘be careful.’”The US dropped the 2,000-pound bomb sparingly in its long war against the Islamic State militant group. Israel, by contrast, has used the bomb frequently in the seven-month Gaza war. Experts say the use of the weapon, in part, has helped drive the enormous Palestinian casualty count that the Hamas-run health ministry puts at more than 34,000 dead, though it doesn’t distinguish between militants and civilians.The US-Israel relationship has been close through both Democratic and Republican administrations. But there have been other moments of deep tension since Israel's founding in which US leaders have threatened to hold up aid in attempt to sway Israeli leadership.President Dwight Eisenhower pressured Israel with the threat of sanctions into withdrawing from the Sinai in 1957 in the midst of the Suez Crisis. Ronald Reagan delayed the delivery of F16 fighter jets to Israel at a time of escalating violence in the Middle East. President George H.W. Bush held up $10 billion in loan guarantees to force the cessation of Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories.",President Joe Biden says he will not supply offensive weapons that Israel could use to launch an all-out assault on Rafah. Biden's comments and his decision last week to pause a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel are the most striking manifestations of the growing daylight between his administration and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109961542,imgsize-909637,width-400,resizemode-4/109961542.jpg"

WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden 's decision to hold up delivery of high payload munitions to Israel was taken over a possible Israeli offensive in Rafah that Washington believes could put Palestinian civilians at risk, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Wednesday.Austin was the first senior Biden administration official to publicly explain what appeared to be a possible shift in US policy towards arming Israel.Biden had pledged his complete support for Israel following the October 7 attack on the country by Palestinian militant group Hamas, and he sent Washington's closest Middle East ally weaponry worth billions of dollars.Austin stressed that the US commitment to Israel's defense remained ""ironclad"" and that the decision on suspending the munitions shipment was not final.Still, he said the US preference would be that ""no major combat take place in Rafah"" and that at a minimum any Israeli operation must safeguard civilian lives.""We've been very clear... from the very beginning that Israel shouldn't launch a major attack into Rafah without accounting for and protecting the civilians that are in that battlespace,"" Austin told a Senate hearing.""And again, as we have assessed the situation, we have paused one shipment of high payload munitions,"" he told a Senate hearing.""We've not made a final determination on how to proceed with that shipment.""Israel has threatened a major assault on Rafah to defeat thousands of Hamas fighters it says are holed up there, but Western nations and the United Nations say a full-scale attack on the city would triggger a humanitarian catastrophe.Hamas' October 7 attack killed about 1,200 people with about 250 others abducted, of whom 133 are believed to remain in captivity in Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.Israel's campaign to destroy Hamas has led to a seven-month-long military campaign that has so far killed a total of 34,789 Palestinians, mostly civilians, the Gaza Health Ministry said.The conflict has also left many of Gaza's 2.3 million people on the brink of starvation and sparked protests in the US demanding that universities and Biden withdraw support for Israel - including the provision of weaponry. Biden is also under pressure from Democrats, including lawmakers in his party, to put more pressure on Israel.A senior US official, speaking on Tuesday on condition of anonymity, said Washington had carefully reviewed the delivery of weapons that might be used in Rafah, and as a result paused a shipment consisting of 1,800 2,000-lb bombs and 1,700 500-lb bombs.Austin did not detail the size or number of the munitions involved.Republican Senator Lindsey Graham was among the Republicans who rebuked the Biden administration over the decision.""This is obscene. It is absurd. Give Israel what they need,"" Graham said, adding it wasn't for Washington to second-guess how Israel fought a war against Hamas militants bent on Israel's destruction.US senator Deb Fischer, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, called on Biden to drop ""his politically-motivated hold"".""American support for Israel cannot be in doubt, especially now,"" she said.For its part, the Israeli military appeared on Wednesday to play down the arms shipment hold-up, saying the allies resolve any disagreements ""behind closed doors"".Speaking at a conference hosted by the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper as the Gaza war entered its eighth month, chief military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari described coordination between Israel and the United States as reaching ""a scope without precedent, I think, in history"".",President Joe Biden's decision to hold up delivery of high payload munitions to Israel was taken over a possible Israeli offensive in Rafah that Washington believes could put Palestinian civilians at risk.

Donald Trump trial: Jurors struggle to maintain composure during Stormy Daniels' testimony,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-trial-jurors-struggle-to-maintain-composure-during-stormy-daniels-testimony/articleshow/109947879.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a noteworthy session at Manhattan Supreme Court on Tuesday, Stormy Daniels gave a detailed and animated account of her alleged affair with former President Donald Trump, leading to moments of levity among the jurors. The judge overseeing the case, Justice Juan Merchan , had to remind prosecutors about the excessive detail Daniels was going into, which he deemed unnecessary.Daniels' testimony included vivid descriptions of a 2006 encounter with Trump at a Lake Tahoe hotel suite, where she humorously recounted an incident of spanking Trump with a magazine bearing his face. This part of her testimony, despite its salacious nature, drew smirks from the jury, though they managed to keep their composure when Daniels described the sexual act itself.Wearing a black kimono-like garment, Daniels spoke quickly and with gestures, visibly frustrating Trump, who was present in the courtroom. Her revelations about their night together painted a picture of a brief and regretful encounter, which she was encouraged to pursue by her publicist for the sake of an interesting story.The former adult film actress also touched on sensitive topics such as Trump's disregard for his then-recent marriage to Melania Trump , claiming he assured her not to worry about his wife as they did not share the same bedroom. These comments prompted visible reactions from Trump, including head shakes and discussions with his defense attorney, Susan Necheles.This high-profile trial, centered on accusations that Trump arranged a hush-money payment to Daniels to prevent her from disclosing their affair during the 2016 presidential campaign, continues to draw significant media attention and public scrutiny. Trump has vehemently denied the allegations, dismissing the case as a politically motivated witch hunt.As the trial progresses, it remains to be seen how the detailed and controversial testimonies, like that of Daniels, will influence the jury's perspective and the final outcome of the case.","Daniels' testimony included vivid descriptions of a 2006 encounter with Trump at a Lake Tahoe hotel suite.

He highlighted the critical role of satellite networks in US military operations, including targeting.

Russia has firmly denied these claims, calling them a hoax by the White House aimed at securing more funding for Ukraine.In terms of proactive measures, Calvert noted that while Nasa plans to return to the moon by 2025 or 2026, he suspects delays might push this timeline back. However, he believes the US military, including the Space Force, will be crucial in securing a lunar presence. ""Space Force will be actively involved in, I think, in going to the moon at some point and that discussion is ongoing...

The authorities complied with this request shortly after the court issued the order, as confirmed by her party and a local administration official, Afzaal Ahmad.The court instructed the authorities to transfer her to Adyala jail in Rawalpindi , a garrison city, where Khan, who is 70 years old and a former cricket superstar, is currently serving a 14-year sentence, as stated by his party.The party mentioned that Bibi's transfer to jail would address critics who believed that her staying at home rather than in prison was part of a deal to gain concessions from the government.Major General Ahmed Sharif, the spokesperson of thePakistan army , stated on Tuesday that it is not feasible to engage in negotiations for any agreement with a group that has carried out attacks against state institutions.He was talking about supporters of the Khan party who stormed and set fire to military installations on May 9 last year to protest against the arrest of the former cricketer, stating that those responsible for the attacks must seek forgiveness before seeking any negotiations.Asad Qaisar, who is a close aide of Khan, mentioned to local ARY TV that there would be no possibility of offering an apology.Khan was removed from his position in 2022. He attributed this to a conspiracy supported by the military, following his disagreements with influential army generals.The military has rejected the accusation.(With inputs from agencies)","Bushra Bibi filed a petition with the Islamabad High Court, alleging that her privacy was violated and contaminated food was served in her cell at home.

The planning of this terror act was done in Afghanistan. Terrorists and their facilitators were also being controlled from Afghanistan and the suicide bomber was also an Afghan [national],"" said Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Maj-Gen Ahmed.Over the past few months, Pakistan has repeatedly criticised the Taliban regime in Kabul for helping terrorists carry out attacks targeting security personnel, and Chinese nationals working on projects linked to Beijing's crucial Belt and Road Initiative.Speaking at a press conference, military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif strongly condemned the acts of terrorism and assured that necessary actions were being taken to bring the facilitators to justice.Despite Pakistan's efforts for peace in the region and hosting Afghan refugees, TTP terrorists continue to launch attacks from Afghan soil, he said.The DG added that Pakistan had presented concrete evidence to the Afghan interim government, but no positive progress has been made.""There is concrete evidence that TTP terrorists are still using Afghan soil to launch attacks in Pakistan ... In this regard, we have registered 12 protests and the army chief has taken a clear stance that Pakistan has its reservations on hideouts of banned outfits in Afghanistan,"" said Sharif.The DG ISPR emphasized that Pakistan will take all measures to eradicate terror networks and protect its citizens.""Pakistan will leave no stone unturned to eradicate terror networks and provide protection to its citizens at all costs ... the purpose of the armed forces is to establish peace in the country ... to ensure this, we will go to every extent to suppress the terrorists and their patrons and enablers,"" said Sharif.Pakistan recently carried out counter-attacks in Afghanistan's border areas, targeting terrorist safe havens.The DG ISPR mentioned that in 2024, security forces have conducted 13,135 operations against terrorists and their facilitators, resulting in the elimination of 249 terrorists and the arrest of 396 others.Pakistani forces are carrying out more than 100 operations daily against terrorism.","Pakistan says attack on Chinese engineers' convoy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in March was planned in Afghanistan.

However, there seems to be an element of hesitancy within the government to engage fully in the investigation, the report noted.A source within the PML-N revealed Nawaz Sharif 's insistence on robust action against the perpetrators, regardless of their political influence. However, there's a noticeable lack of enthusiasm from the current government to involve bodies such as the NAB or FIA in the investigation, despite suggestions, according to Dawn.Information Minister Attaullah Tarar's dismissal of engaging the NAB or FIA raises eyebrows, especially given the magnitude of the alleged scam, which surpasses PKR 500 million, warranting their involvement according to new laws. The government's cautious approach, attributed to the involvement of the former caretaker government, reflects a reluctance to tread on contentious ground.Reports suggesting substantial wheat imports under Shehbaz Sharif's administration post-elections have added another layer to the controversy, the report noted. Denials from government officials contradict the allegations, further complicating the situation. Blame for the wheat crisis is shifted to the caretaker government, distancing the current administration from any culpability.Adding to the confusion are reports of the summoning of former caretaker officials by the fact-finding committee, which were swiftly denied by its head, Kamran Ali Afzal.Tensions continue to escalate within the PML-N, with Hanif Abbasi confronting former caretaker premier Anwaarul Haq Kakar over the wheat scandal. Kakar's veiled threats hint at underlying political manoeuvring, adding intrigue to the unfolding drama. The PTI seized the opportunity to push for a judicial commission, capitalising on the discord within the opposition camp.Amidst the chaos, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strived to reassure farmers of his unwavering support.His formation of a committee to address farmers' grievances demonstrates a proactive stance, aiming to alleviate concerns regarding wheat procurement, Dawn reported.","The Pakistan government's response to the wheat scam investigation appears to be evasive.

You are behaving like [government's] B-team against PTI.""Khan highlighted the unresolved issues regarding PTI's electoral symbol, alleged rigging during general elections and the status of PTI's petitions , behind his allegations of PTI being denied level playing field.He criticized the judiciary for what he perceived as coerced decisions and urged Supreme Court judges to emulate the stance of high court judges in rejecting wrongful decisions.Expressing a willingness to engage in dialogue, Khan conditioned it upon the return of what he claimed was a 'stolen mandate' and the release of imprisoned party workers. He stressed that dialogue typically occurs with adversaries, hinting at a potential negotiation with PTI's perceived adversaries.Former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry had suggested that if Khan struck a deal with the establishment, he would effectively become Shehbaz Sharif.Chaudhry's remarks surfaced amidst discussions surrounding alleged talks between PTI and the establishment, which were initiated by senior PTI leader Shehryar Afridi. PTI leader Shehryar Afridi said that his party will hold ""dialogue with the chief of army staff (COAS) and the director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence (DG ISI) soon"" instead of speaking to ""rejected people"" who reached parliament through Form 47.Chaudhry expressed skepticism about Khan's likelihood of striking such a deal, asserting that Shehbaz Sharif's current threats originate not from within his party but from external forces.","Imran Khan, the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), has accused Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa of bias against his party.

"Rape, terror and death at sea: How a boat carrying Rohingya children, women and men capsized",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/rape-terror-and-death-at-sea-how-a-boat-carrying-rohingya-children-women-and-men-capsized/articleshow/109951864.cms,"MEULABOH: Huddled on board the boat, the 12-year-old girl quaked with fear.The captain and crew who she says had tortured her and three other women and girls were not finished. And the punishment for disobedience, the men warned, would be death.It was the third night that the girl and around 140 other ethnic Rohingya refugees had been trapped on the fishing boat off Indonesia 's coast.They had fled Bangladesh and their homeland of Myanmar in a bid to escape violence and terror , only to face the same at sea.The 12-year-old - identified in this story only by the initial N, because she is a sexual assault survivor - tried to hide. She had already survived a night in the captain's bedroom, where she says he and several crew members had beaten and sexually abused her.Like most of the passengers, she had survived attacks by Myanmar's military that forced her and her family to flee to neighboring Bangladesh. There, she had survived nearly seven years in violence-plagued refugee camps. And she had thus far survived this journey without her family, who hoped she'd make it to Malaysia , where she was promised as a child bride to a man she had never met.The captain ordered more girls to join him and his crew in the bedroom.""If you don't come to us,"" he shouted, ""then we will capsize this boat!""What happened next would force N and the other Rohingya on board into yet another battle for survival.For many, this would be the battle they finally lost.In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat off the coast of Indonesia's province of Aceh. Another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed when the boat capsized, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.Until now, little was known about why the boat capsized. This account, as told to The Associated Press in interviews with eight surviving passengers, provides the first insight into what happened.N's journey began in Bangladesh, where a series of boats ferried her and other Rohingya across the Bay of Bengal.The bedlam began, the passengers say, when they were transferred to a cramped Indonesian vessel that was supposed to take them to Indonesia. From there, they would be smuggled into Malaysia.The Indonesian captain and crew separated the men from the women and forced the men into the boat's cargo holds. Anyone who protested was beaten, says Muhammed Amin.The captain and crew - who warned they were armed, though no one saw a gun - forced N and four other women and girls into the captain's bedroom.One of the women slipped out, but N and the others were trapped. The assaults by the captain and five of his six crew lasted all night, N says.When morning dawned, N was allowed out to use the toilet. She hid among the other women, but the other three girls were abused for a second night.On the third night, the three girls emerged from the captain's room, sobbing and speechless.The captain and crew demanded fresh victims. The women refused.The captain and crew had been drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana, the passengers say. The furious captain threatened to capsize the boat unless the women complied.Soon after, Jannat Ullah says, he saw the captain push the steering wheel with his leg.The vessel tilted violently, sending passengers tumbling. And then it smashed into a wave.In the blackness of the water, people screamed for salvation, for God, for their children.N battled her way onto the boat's overturned hull. Once again, she had managed to survive. But the three girls who were abused alongside her had not.Amin spotted the captain and three crew members swimming away.In the morning, a small fishing boat arrived, and took six people to shore.Meanwhile, worsening waves had destabilized the capsized boat, which overturned again, killing more people.Rain spared passengers death by dehydration. But as another night passed, it was clear not everyone would survive. Rahena Begum's 9-year-old daughter stopped breathing.The passengers prayed, then slid the child's body into the sea.Around 30 minutes later, Rahena says, the rescue ship finally arrived.The bodies of 12 women and three children have since been recovered off Aceh, according to the UNHCR.Although the fishing boat's crew rescued the initial six people the morning of March 20, search vessels weren't launched until that evening. Officials didn't finish rescuing the passengers until midday on March 21.Ibnu Harris Al Hussain, chief of Banda Aceh's search and rescue agency, said the rescue operation began shortly after his agency learned about the boat.""The most important thing is that we have ensured their safety when they were found,"" Hussain wrote in a message to the AP.On April 2, police announced they had arrested three crew members, plus a fourth man who was not on the boat. They were charged with people smuggling, which carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence. Police are searching for the remaining crew, including the captain, who fled to Malaysia, West Aceh Police Chief Andi Kirana told the AP.Police are not considering murder charges, Kirana says, because they believe the capsize was an accident.But N and the other passengers believe the disaster was a deliberate act of revenge by a sadistic captain and crew. And for that, N says, the punishment should fit the crime.""They tortured us. They treated us like animals,"" she says. ""We want the government to treat them like animals.""Kirana also said police are not considering rape charges, because they haven't received reports of sexual assault. But N says police have never questioned her.N hopes to make it to Malaysia and to the man who wants her as his wife.Maybe then, she says, she will finally be free - though in reality, Rohingya child brides in Malaysia often become prisoners to abusive husbands.For now, all she can do is fight to survive another day.""I don't want to suffer anymore,"" she says.___Gelineau reported from Sydney.","In March, Indonesian officials and local fishermen rescued 75 people from the overturned hull of a boat off the coast of Indonesia's province of Aceh. Another 67 passengers, including at least 28 children, were killed when the boat capsized. This account, as told to The Associated Press in interviews with eight surviving passengers, provides the first insight into what happened.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109952239,imgsize-1558745,width-400,resizemode-4/109952239.jpg"
