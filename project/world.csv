The draft of a ‘Kuki-Zo People’s Referendum Ballot’ to decide whether the tribe wants a Union Territory carved out of Manipur’s hill districts has set the stage for potentially the second such exercise by any North-East community since the May 16, 1951, so-called plebiscite involving the region’s Naga people.“Do you, as a Kuki-Zo person residing in Manipur, support creation of a UT comprising all Kuki-Zo villages , to be governed directly by Centre, ensuring safety, justice, and equitable development?” states the draft.Meanwhile, Manipur’s Kuki-Zo Council withdrew on Thursday evening the indefinite shutdown in parts of the restive state after ayouth’s death in a March 8 clash with security forces over the resumption of “free movement” between the hills and the valley","Draft of a ‘Kuki-Zo People’s Referendum Ballot’ to decide whether the tribe wants a Union Territory carved out of Manipur's hill districts.

NEW DELHI: People’s Democratic Party (PDP) chairperson Mehbooba Mufti on Thursday criticized the Uttar Pradesh chief minister , accusing him of creating ""divisions between Hindus and Muslims"".Mufti said that in the past, people from both communities celebrated Holi and Eid together in harmony. She warned about the negative impact of the division she believes is being spread by the government.""The atmosphere across the country is deteriorating. Earlier, Holi was celebrated happily, and Hindus & Muslims used to celebrate this together, like they celebrate Eid. Now, the atmosphere has been vitiated, especially by the UP CM. The kind of behaviour that is being meted out to the Muslims is very wrong. This country used to be of Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb and Hindus & Muslims lived together happily. But now, they are spreading poison. The impact would be very bad,"" Mufti said while speaking to reporters in Shopian district of Jammu & Kashmir.Mufti compared the situation in India to events in Pakistan under former President Zia-ul-Haq. She said that communal tensions created during his rule still affect Pakistan today.""Zia-ul-Haq created a similar communal atmosphere in Pakistan once, and their country has still not overcome that.

With the body of a youth killed in Manipur’s Kuki-dominated Kangpokpi on March 8 finally handed over to his family, authorities there said Wednesday they expect protests and blockade in the district to end soon.However, the road to lasting peace in the restive state may be a long way off. Ongoing talks between the Kuki-Zo community and Centre’s interlocutor A K Mishra are unlikely to make much headway with the former sticking to its demand for a “separate hill state” after hiving off Meitei-dominated Valley areas.The demand, which goes against the Constitutional framework, will not be acceptable to the Centre.Govt also does not seem keen to concede to the Kuki demand for a separate administrative framework for the tribal-dominated hilly regions either, recognising that it can fuel the demand for a separate state, besides giving fillip to separatist tendencies in the strategically crucial border state.Still, efforts would be to stay engaged with both Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities, while tactfully persuading the latter to settle for a solution within the four corners of the Constitution, including granting them more autonomy and preserving their unique culture, heritage and language.Sources said the district magistrate and superintendent of police of Kangpokpi had been engaging with Kuki-Zo protestors over the past few days to persuade them to accept the body of the local killed during protests on March 8, amid clashes between them and security forces.The killing had triggered further tension with Kuki-Zo protestors ordering a shutdown, apart from blocking roads and stopping the movement of vehicles. “The blockade call was given for all areas with a significant Kuki-Zo population. But its effect was seen largely in Kangpokpi. However, the talks between the local administration and community representatives have made headway, with the family of the deceased protester taking back his body for last rites,” said a Manipur govt functionary.A senior Manipur police functionary shared that a total 4,500 weapons, including those looted after ethnic violence broke out in Manipur in May 2023, were now back with police. Of these, around 1,050 were surrendered by rebels in response to a call given by Governor Ajay Bhalla.“The remaining weapons were recovered in raids and searches undertaken over time by police and security forces. These raids shall continue, now that the deadline set by the governor to voluntarily surrender weapons has ended,” said the functionary.Manipur MP Bimol Akoijam protested in Lok Sabha that his question about the state was removed from the list of questions after having been listed initially. He raised the issue in Lok Sabha during the zero hour. Jagdambika Pal, who was in the chair, denied permission to raise the issue. “This issue cannot be raised here,” he said. Akoijam has been raising issues related to the state which is affected by ethnic strife for around two years. His office, however, refused to answer what the issue was about.","The body of a youth killed in Manipur’s Kuki-dominated Kangpokpi on March 8 finally handed over to his family on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: The post-mortem reports of three youths from J&K’s Kathua, who were found dead three days after they went missing, have not revealed any gunshot wound or physical assault, ruling out a “terrorist attack” angle.The trauma injuries , including to their heads, point to their death by “accidental fall from a height,” said sources.Sharing this, sources in the J&K govt also told TOI that two more minors, who went missing from the same district — they were reported by their family as missing only a couple of days ago though they have been gone since Feb 28 — had an argument with their family and possibly left home to work elsewhere on daily wages.This, the sources said, has happened before with the cousins, aged 12 and 15 and both herders, staying away from their family home for days to do daily-wage jobs. The police are making enquiries with their relatives and past employers to trace them.As per the post-mortem reports of the three Kathua residents — identified as Darshan Singh, 40, Yogesh Singh, 32, and Varun Singh, 15 — whose bodies were discovered on March 8 in a gorge next to a waterfall, the cause of their death was trauma and head injury, purportedly caused by their accidentally slipping in the dark, down a rocky gorge. A backpack carried by one of them got stuck on a branch as they fell. A mobile used by them was also recovered from the spot. A liquor bottle with half of its contents consumed was found, pointing to possible inebriated state of the two adults.“Their viscera reports are now awaited for further insight into the cause and circumstances of the deaths,” said a source.Interviews with the family members of the three deceased persons, who were on their way to a wedding in Lohai Malhar, revealed that they were in touch with them over phone till the evening of March 5 and had even communicated that they had lost their way while moving with wedding party. However, a couple of hours later their phones were found to be switched off.","Post-mortem reports of three youths from J&K’s Kathua, who were found dead three days after they went missing, have not revealed any gunshot wound or physical assault.

NEW DELHI: After Airtel and Jio announced partnerships with Starlink in the last couple of days, opposition Congress and CPM on Thursday raised national security concerns and the former alleged that the deals were “orchestrated” by PM Narendra Modi “to buy goodwill” with US President Donald Trump through Starlink owner Elon Musk.Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said Airtel and Jio had announced partnerships with Starlink within 12 hours of each other, seemingly overcoming their objections to its entry into India.“It is abundantly clear that these partnerships have been orchestrated by none other than the PM himself to buy goodwill with President Trump through Starlink owner Elon Musk,” he alleged.“But many questions remain. Perhaps the most important one relates to national security. Who will have the power to switch connectivity on or off when national security demands it? Will it be Starlink or its Indian partners? Will other satellite-based connectivity providers also be permitted and on what basis?” Ramesh asked on X.He added that the much larger question of Tesla manufacturing in India remained unanswered. “Is there some commitment to it now that Starlink’s entry into India has been facilitated,” he asked.Pointing out that “Supreme Court had held in the 2G case that spectrum is a scarce resource and can be allocated to private players only through open, transparent auction”, the CPM politburo said, “Any private deal for allocating spectrum would be a violation of the law of the land.Jio, Airtel and Starlink coming together to form a cartel to dominate satellite spectrum use will be at the cost of millions of telecom subscribers in India.” CPM added that satellite spectrum should be allocated exclusively for strategic uses, such as defence and Isro operations.The party said telecom services were critical for a country’s defence. “It is now known that US threats to stop Starlink services to Ukraine military forced Zelensky to concede US demands on handing over its natural resources and negotiating with Russia under US aegis,” it added.",Airtel and Jio announced partnerships with Starlink in the last couple of days.

BHOPAL: Police arrested two “forest watchers” at Kanha National Park in Mandla district of Madhya Pradesh and booked them under UAPA, on the charge of having ties with Maoists, triggering unrest among forest staff. Many are now seeking transfer for fear of getting caught between Maoists and police.“Watchers” are the ones who patrol forests on foot. “Hamare logon ko tiger se dar nahi lagta saheb, police se lagta hai (We are more scared of police than tigers),” a forest officer said.Police said they arrested the duo, Ashok Kumar Lal and Santosh Kumar Lal, both 28, during a Maoist encounter on Sunday in which an insurgent was killed.“Both of them were good patrol guards, always vigilant. What are they supposed to do? Maoists threaten to kill their families if they don’t help them and, if they do, police arrest them for supporting anti-nationals,” the forest officer, requesting not to be named, said.Mandla police say the duo was caught “signalling” information to Maoists on the movement of security forces. From atop a hillock, they would whistle in a certain way or strike stones together as per a prearranged code to warn Maoists, police said.Forest officers maintain the duo was indeed “signalling” to Maoists — but to collect their food and ration. “They were not signalling Maoists about movement of forces. It’s a wrong perception,” the officer added.Though the duo claimed it was their first interaction with Maoists, investigators say they found handwritten notes and other evidence suggesting a much deeper connection with insurgents.","“Watchers” are the ones who patrol forests on foot.

His body was found in his field in Shivni Armal village on Thursday morning.A three-page suicide note found in Nagare’s pocket said: “The administration is ignoring farmers’ issues.

The protesters declared that they would not allow the body to be taken for a postmortem unless the guardian minister or district collector visited the site and gave concrete assurances.The deceased farmer’s wife, Sushila Nagare, who broke down while speaking to the media, said, “My husband took this step because of govt’s negligence.

SRINAGAR: By the time medical students in J&K complete their theses, they have presumably diagnosed diseases, prescribed treatments, and memorised the human anatomy down to the last nerve. Yet, when it comes to writing a few heartfelt lines in the acknowledgments section, originality seems to flatline.A recent study conducted by SKIMS Medical College in Srinagar has uncovered an amusing yet troubling pattern — many medical theses in the region are filled with copy-pasted praise, particularly when it comes to thanking guides and invoking divine blessings.Take, for instance, the timeless classic: “His able guidance and constant supervision”, which appeared 18 times. Or the melodramatic, “Where I am today is because of you”, which found its way into 15 theses.A particularly poetic declaration — “The saying ‘I am the slave of the person who has taught me a single word’ depicts the great reality” — was spotted eight times.And then there’s the divine intervention. One grand statement, thanking the almighty for bestowing “endless opportunities” and “showering mercy,” was repeated 40 times across different papers.Another variation, praising “Almighty ALLAH, the creator and lord of the whole universe”, appeared in 20 theses. If originality is the soul of research, these acknowledgments suggest it may be in need of urgent resuscitation.The one area where researchers seemed to find their own words was in thanking their spouses. The phrases “Thank you for your love, blessings, and encouragement” and “Innumerable sacrifices” were among the least plagiarised lines, proving that when it comes to marital diplomacy, sincerity beats Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V.The study analysed the acknowledgment sections of 63 theses from four institutions — SKIMS Medical College, Govt Medical College (GMC) Srinagar, GMC Jammu, and ASCOMS Jammu — and found that the same phrases were used over and over again, almost as if they were part of an unspoken template.Dr Shabir Dhar, the study’s lead researcher, has long wondered why India’s international medical research footprint remains small despite the thousands of theses produced each year.He said a “significant lack of inventiveness and originality” may be to blame. “This lack of originality starts from the acknowledgment section, where after spending three years with our colleagues and teachers, we are not able to frame sentences describing them for what they are,” he said. “We end up copy-pasting material.”The study raises a thought-provoking question: If future doctors struggle to write a few original lines about the people who helped shape their careers, what does that say about their ability to think independently in their medical research?Dhar said the problem reflects a broader pattern in the region’s research culture. “I wanted to know if the lack of inventive and original thought affects our interpersonal evaluation. Apparently, it does,” he said.","A recent study conducted by SKIMS Medical College in Srinagar has uncovered an amusing yet troubling pattern.

SRINAGAR: A Gulmarg hotel where models from a recent controversial fashion show stayed is owned by his relatives, J&K CM Omar Abdullah acknowledged Thursday amid growing political backlash over the event that took place during Ramzan “Yes, my relatives have two hotels in Gulmarg, Nedous Hotel and Highland Park,” Omar told reporters in Gulmarg. However, he declined further comment, saying: “I stand by what I have said in the assembly.”BJP’s J&K president Sunil Sharma has accused the CM of having ties to the event due to the models and designers staying at his relatives’ hotel — Nedous.The March 7 fashion show, organised by designer duo Shivan & Narresh to mark their 15th anniversary, sparked outrage after images of scantily clad models walking on snow circulated online. The open-air show drew sharp criticism from religious leaders and political parties, including opposition PDP and Kashmir’s chief cleric Mirwaiz Umar Farooq.NC spokesperson Ifra Jan said it is unrealistic to expect authorities to monitor every private event in thousands of hotels across J&K. “Now that the court has taken cognisance, we are hopeful this will serve as a deterrent against obscenity and immoral activities in J&K,” she said.Chief judicial magistrate of Srinagar, acting on a plea by Awami Ittehad Party (AIP) member Adil Nazir Khan, issued a pre-cognisance notice to the directors of the firm that organised the event.Khan’s advocate Naveed Bukhtiyar said the notice was issued over allegations of “public consumption of alcohol, obscenity, and hurting religious sentiments”. The case is scheduled for a hearing on April 8.CM Omar had earlier clarified in the assembly that his govt had no involvement in the privately organised show. He acknowledged concerns that such an event should not have taken place, especially during the Ramzan month.“I completely agree. Such an event should not have been held at any time of the year in a place, given the cultural and social ethos of our region,” he had said.Police have launched an inquiry, with Omar assuring appropriate action if any law was violated.Following public outcry , the designers had issued an apology. “…Our sole intention was to celebrate creativity and the ski & après-ski lifestyle, without any desire to offend anyone or any religious sentiments ,” they said in a statement.","The March 7 fashion show sparked outrage after images of scantily clad models walking on snow circulated online.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has hinted at India being behind the train hijacking in Balochistan this week, saying the handlers of the attackers were based in Afghanistan and were allegedly sponsored by India.On Thursday, Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said Islamabad had evidence that calls related to the hijacking originated in Afghanistan. Asked by reporters whether Islamabad had shifted its stance from India to Afghanistan over involvement in terrorist attacks on Pakistan, he said, “There is no shift in our policy. And again, the facts have not changed. India is involved in sponsoring terrorism against Pakistan. What I was referring to was, in this particular incident, we have evidence of calls being traced to Afghanistan. This is what I said.”Since the start of the attack on Tuesday Pakistan’s military, govt and media supporters have been blaming India without directly naming it in connection with the train assault, while keeping mum about grave security failures on the parts of the country’s military and intelligence authorities.While India has yet to respond to Pakistan’s latest allegations, Afghanistan’s foreign affairs ministry issue a statement, saying: “We categorically reject baseless allegations by the Pakistani army spokesman linking the attack on a passenger train in Balochistan province with Afghanistan, & urge Pakistani side to focus on resolving their own security & internal problems instead of such irresponsible remarks.”The Jaffar Express, carrying over 450 passengers, was seized by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist militant group, on March 11, leading to a deadly confrontation that left 58 dead, including 21 passengers, four soldiers, and all 33 militants.Pakistan has repeatedly accused India of fuelling unrest in Balochistan by backing groups like the BLA, a charge New Delhi dismisses as baseless. The latest claim comes as the BLA ramps up its campaign against the state, with the train hijacking marking a bold escalation in tactics.Analysts see it as part of a broader wave of militancy straining Pakistan’s security apparatus. Some observers said the Balochistan insurgency , fuelled by local grievances over poverty and political exclusion, has persisted for decades, casting doubt on the need for external provocation. “The BLA doesn’t require foreign sponsors to act but blaming India fits a familiar narrative here,” said Islamabad-based journalist Nazrul Islam.Relations between Pakistan and India, already frigid since the 2019 Pulwama attack, remain on edge, with little prospect of dialogue. For now, the Jaffar Express incident stands as a grim reminder of the region’s volatility, and the enduring rift between Islamabad and New Delhi.",Pakistan has hinted at India being behind the train hijacking in Balochistan this week.

Will Canadians require a visa for the US?



Tariff war triggers new rule for Canadians?



Amid Donald Trump's ongoing tariff war with Canada, the US government has come up with a new rule for Canadians who are in the United States for 30 days or longer and those who have crossed the land border. Starting on April 11, Canadians who plan to stay in the US for longer than 30 days will be required to apply for registration and be fingerprinted. So far, Canadians have been exempt from both rules which apply to other foreign nationals.Traditionally, Canadians who cross the northern border by land and stay for over 30 days do not need to register with the federal government. However, the new rule would require them to fill out a different form to enter the US, which is not a visa. Canadians never needed any form or visa to enter the US for casual travelling, tourism, shopping etc.Those violating the rule may face fines of up to $5,000, six months in jail or both, according to the Federal Register, which was updated with the new guidance Wednesday.The new policy for Canadians is tied to President Donald Trump's executive order 'Protecting the American People Against Invasion' that he signed on the first day in the White House. The order is aimed at curbing ""the unprecedented flood of illegal immigration into the United States"".According to Statistics Canada, 4.1 million Canadian residents arrived from trips abroad in December 2024. Of those, 2.1 million arrived from the United States by car, and 68.3% of those trips were taken within the same day.Reports said the new requirement is rooted in existing immigration law which states that foreign nationals of 14 or older and not already registered with American authorities have to register and fingerprinted if they plan to be in the US for 30 days or longer, but these rules were never applied to Canadians entering the US via land borders.It's now that the administration is moving to implement these rules for Canadians as Trump is engaged in a bitter trade war with Canada. The tariff war is now paused as both sides decided to sit across the table to address the situation.","Traditionally, Canadians who cross the northern border by land and stay for over 30 days do not need to register with the federal government.

Who is David Weldon? Trump’s CDC director pick withdrawn by White House hours before confirmation hearing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-david-weldon-trumps-cdc-director-pick-withdrawn-by-white-house-hours-before-confirmation-hearing/articleshow/118985053.cms,"David Weldon (Photo: AP)

Who is David Weldon?



David Weldon, 71, is an internal medicine physician best known for serving as a congressional representative for a central Florida district from 1995 to 2009.

Though he maintained a relatively low profile in recent years, he resurfaced in the public eye when President Trump nominated him for CDC director in November.

Weldon's stance on vaccines made him a favored candidate among allies of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new Secretary of Health and Human Services.

He has expressed skepticism toward established vaccine science, and as recently as 2019, he promoted the unsubstantiated theory that vaccines could cause autism.

In 2007, Weldon co-authored a "" vaccine safety bill"" alongside former Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney.

bill"" alongside former Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney. The proposed bill aimed to ""provide the independence necessary to ensure that vaccine safety research is robust, unbiased, free from conflict of interest criticism, and broadly accepted by the public at large,"" Weldon said in a press release announcing the bill.

The White House has withdrawn US President Donald Trump's nomination of former Florida representative Dr David Weldon to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , as announced by the Republican-controlled Senate health committee on Thursday.The decision to withdraw the nomination came less than an hour before he was set to appear before the US Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions for his confirmation hearing.The decision was made because Weldon lacked the necessary votes for confirmation, two sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.Earlier, Senator Patty Murray, a health committee member, expressed grave concerns about Weldon following their meeting. ""I was deeply disturbed to hear Dr Weldon repeat debunked claims about vaccines,"" the Democrat said in a statement.""It's dangerous to put someone in charge at CDC who believes the lie that our rigorously tested childhood vaccine schedule is somehow exposing kids to toxic levels of mercury or causing autism,"" Murray continued.""As we face one of the worst measles outbreaks in years thanks to President Trump, a vaccine skeptic who spent years spreading lies about safe and proven vaccines should never have even been under consideration to lead the foremost agency charged with protecting public health,"" she added.Weldon is the third Trump administration nominee to withdraw before a confirmation hearing, following former US Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general and Chad Chronister for the Drug Enforcement Administration, according to the Associated Press.","The White House has withdrawn US President Donald Trump's nomination of Dr David Weldon to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The Government Efficiency Department declared this week via X that it has terminated over 200,000 government credit cards.Under the supervision of billionaire and White House advisor Elon Musk , DOGE announced on February 18 its collaboration with agencies to streamline credit card accounts and decrease administrative expenses. The organisation noted that the federal government maintained 4.6 million credit cards, processing 90 million distinct transactions in fiscal year 2024.Following this, President Donald Trump signed an executive order initiating a ""transformation in Federal spending"", implementing a 30-day suspension of agency employee credit cards.The list of organisations affected by credit card cancellations encompasses numerous federal bodies, including the GSA, OPM, Labour Department, SBA, Education Department, Interior Department, Treasury Department, Commerce Department, EPA, USDA, NASA, HHS, Homeland Security, Social Security Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.The Interior Department experienced the most significant impact, with approximately 20,000 purchase cards and 40,000 travel cards being terminated. Following closely, HHS had over 43,700 travel credit cards and 2,235 purchase cards withdrawn from service. On the contrary, amongst the 16 federal agencies, the State Department stands alone as the only organisation that maintained its credit card services without any cancellations, according to Fox news.On Tuesday, DOGE provided its three-week progress report on cancelled credit cards. ""Pilot program with 16 agencies to audit unused/unneeded credit cards. After 3 weeks, >200,000 cards have been de-activated,"" it said.The credit card suspension is reportedly causing operational difficulties for agencies, as per USA Today reports.

However, various news sources have documented the freeze's impact on routine agency operations.The Food and Drug Administration staff reported difficulties in procuring laboratory supplies essential for ensuring consumer safety, according to Wired and the Washington Post. The agency confirmed to the Post its continuation of mission-critical activities.Meanwhile, Department of Defense civilian employees faced a $1 limit on government travel credit cards, as per a March 5 memo. The memo exempts travel ""in direct support of military operations or a permanent change of station"".According to Wired and the Post, the $1 credit card limit has affected various other agencies.","The Government Efficiency Department has terminated over 200,000 government credit cards.

US President Donald Trump on Thursday again raised the idea of the United States annexing Greenland , saying he believes it will eventually happen.Speaking alongside Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte Trump suggested that the island’s control could be important for global security.""I think it will happen,"" Trump said when asked about Greenland. ""And I'm just thinking, I didn't give it much thought before, but I'm sitting with a man who could be very instrumental. You know, Mark, we need that for international security, not just security, international. We have a lot of our favourite players, you know, cruising around the coast, and we have to be careful. And we'll be talking to you.""Although Trump suggested that Nato could help with the acquisition, Rutte quickly distanced the alliance from the idea. ""As for Greenland joining the US, I would rather leave that out of this discussion. I don’t want to bring Nato into it,"" he said.Meanwhile, Greenland’s Demokraatit Party, which supports a gradual approach to independence from Denmark, secured an unexpected victory in parliamentary elections. The party has openly opposed Trump's efforts to bring Greenland under US control.The result should send clear message to Trump — Denmark is not for sale, said Demokraatit leader JensFriederik Nielsen. “We don’t want to be Americans. No, we don’t want to be Danes. We want to be Greenlanders. And we want our own independence in the future. And we want to build our own country by ourselves, not with his hope.”Trump has relentlessly expressed interest in acquiring Greenland from Denmark, a suggestion that has met with ridicule and strong rejection from Danish officials.","US President Donald Trump again raised the idea of the United States annexing Greenland.

Donald Trump files emergency Supreme Court appeal after judges block birthright citizenship ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-files-emergency-supreme-court-appeal-after-judges-block-birthright-citizenship-ban/articleshow/118999901.cms,"ANI

The Trump administration in an emergency appeal on Thursday asked the US Supreme Court to allow its plan to end birthright citizenship , arguing that lower courts overstepped by blocking the policy.Federal judges have already ruled that the executive order is unconstitutional, citing America’s long history of granting citizenship by birth . Trump is now pushing for an emergency ruling to enforce his order in limited cases.In January, a federal judge declared Trump’s executive order ""blatantly unconstitutional,"" preventing it from taking effect. Another judge in Maryland ruled that the order contradicts over 250 years of American law. Courts in Maryland, Massachusetts, and Washington have all blocked the policy following lawsuits from over 20 states, immigrant rights groups, and individual plaintiffs.The Justice Department argued that nationwide injunctions have become excessive, preventing the government from enforcing a key immigration policy. It also accused past administrations of wrongly interpreting the Constitution, saying that birthright citizenship was never meant to apply to children of undocumented immigrants or temporary visa holders. The administration believes this has encouraged illegal immigration.Signed on January 20—his first day back in office—Trump’s executive order aims to end automatic citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and temporary visa holders. The policy applies to births from February 19 onward and does not affect those already granted citizenship.According to ANI, Trump’s appeal does not ask the Supreme Court to decide whether the policy itself is constitutional. Instead, his lawyers are making a “modest” request to limit the scope of the lower court injunctions.The Supreme Court will likely schedule a briefing to hear arguments from those who oppose Trump’s order.","Federal judges have already ruled that the executive order is unconstitutional, citing America’s long history of granting citizenship by birth.

UN experts accuse Israel of genocidal acts and sexual violence in Gaza • FRANCE 24 English

A United Nations-backed team of human rights experts accused Israel of using sexual, reproductive, and gender-based violence in its military campaign against Hamas in Gaza, reported news agency Associated Press.The report, released on Thursday, is among the most detailed investigations into such allegations since the war began on October 7, 2023. Israel has strongly rejected the claims, calling the UN body biased.The report documents violations allegedly committed by Israeli security forces against Palestinian men, women, and children. The findings could be used as evidence in international legal cases, including at the International Criminal Court.According to the commission, Israeli forces carried out attacks on hospitals, health facilities, and civilian areas, disproportionately affecting women and children. It also accused Israeli authorities of subjecting Palestinian detainees to sexual violence and destroying reproductive healthcare services.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the Human Rights Council an “anti-Israel circus” that supports terrorism. Israel’s UN mission in Geneva also rejected the findings, arguing that the commission relied on second-hand and unverified sources. Since the commission’s formation in 2021, Israel has refused to cooperate with its investigations, citing bias.Hamas, in response to the report, urged international courts to prosecute Israeli leaders. The International Criminal Court has already issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and other top Israeli officials for alleged war crimes. The court has also issued a warrant for Hamas’ military leader, who was later confirmed dead.The war in Gaza began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages.","UN experts accuse Israel of genocidal acts and sexual violence in Gaza.

An Elon Musk-backed group, Building America’s Future, is running attack ads against Republican lawmakers in multiple states over their support of the 340B drug pricing program . The 340B program , requires drug companies to give discounts to hospitals treating low-income patients.The 340B program, created to help hospitals serving uninsured and low-income patients, has been a long-running battleground between hospitals and pharmaceutical companies. Hospitals argue that the program is essential to providing affordable care, while drug manufacturers claim it forces them to sell medications at a loss.The video ads, titled ""Trump underminers,"" have been aired in Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Kentucky, reported Associated Press. They claim that some Republicans are expanding the 340B program, which they allege funds gender transitions for children, abortions, and healthcare for undocumented immigrants. It says it ""is now a disaster"" and to ""let Trump fix 340B.""North Dakota Rep. Jon Nelson dismissed the ad’s message claiming that drug companies want to eliminate the program because it forces them to sell at a discount.Lawmakers insist that there is no active movement to expand the 340B program. Kentucky State Sen. Stephen Meredith clarified that his legislation is not about 340B expansion but about protecting rural healthcare providers from discrimination by pharmaceutical manufacturers.The ads have aired on television in multiple states, and the group also ran messages in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania in past elections. The group previously funded campaigns that targeted Vice President Kamala Harris over her stance on Israel.In February, the group posted a photo on X (formerly Twitter) of a truck parked outside the North Dakota Capitol, displaying messages claiming 340B subsidises gender transitions for kids. However, North Dakota banned gender-affirming care for minors in 2023.","Elon Musk-backed group, Building America’s Future, is running attack ads against Republican lawmakers in multiple states over their support of the 340B drug pricing program.

Federal judge in San Francisco and Maryland ordered US President Donald Trump's administration to reinstate numerous probationary workers who were dismissed across various agencies.In San Francisco, Judge William Alsup criticised the government's methods on Thursday whilst halting the administration's substantial reduction of federal staff. The judge determined that the Office of Personnel Management and its acting director, Charles Ezell, executed terminations without proper authority.He further mandated several departments, including Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury, to promptly offer reinstatement to staff terminated around February 13 and 14. The departments must provide details within seven days regarding probationary employees and their compliance with the directive.The administration lodged an appeal against the injunction with the Ninth Circuit Court. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the administration's position, stating, ""The Trump Administration will immediately fight back against this absurd and unconstitutional order.""Judge Alsup expressed concern about the government's circumvention of workforce reduction regulations by dismissing probationary workers lacking appeal rights. He criticised the practice of citing poor performance as grounds for dismissal despite recent positive evaluations.""These mass-firings of federal workers were not just an attack on government agencies and their ability to function, they were also a direct assault on public lands, wildlife, and the rule of law,"" said Erik Molvar, executive director of Western Watersheds Project, one of the plaintiffs.Meanwhile, in the second ruling issued by the Maryland court, judge temporarily halted the widespread dismissals of probationary federal employees and mandated the reinstatement of thousands who were terminated, marking the second such ruling within 24 hours.US District Judge James Bredar issued the directive on Thursday evening in response to legal proceedings initiated by 19 states and the District of Columbia against several federal agencies, challenging the legality of these extensive terminations. The states argue that the Trump administration caught them off guard by disregarding established regulations governing large-scale redundancies, which are presently affecting state governments as they attempt to support those who have abruptly lost their employment.The order resulted from legal action by labour unions and organisations opposing the Republican administration's federal workforce reduction efforts.As these judges ruled against Trump administration's orders, a Washington DC judge ruled against unions, directing workers to follow established employment procedures.Government lawyers maintained the dismissals' legitimacy, citing individual agency reviews of probationary employees.The federal system includes approximately 200,000 probationary workers, comprising new employees and recently promoted staff. California employs about 15,000, serving in various capacities from fire prevention to veterans' services, according to the coalition's lawsuit.The plaintiffs documented that numerous agencies cited OPM directives for the terminations, using template emails citing performance issues as justification.","Federal judge in San Francisco and Maryland ordered US President Donald Trump's administration to reinstate numerous probationary workers.

Columbia University disciplines student protesters who seized campus building last year

Columbia University has has expelled students involved in last year’s pro-Palestinian protests, expelling some, suspending others, and revoking the diplomas of certain graduates.The university made the announcement on Thursday in a campus-wide email, citing violations related to the occupation of Hamilton Hall in April 2024. Students who had only participated in the encampment without entering Hamilton Hall were not subjected to further punishment.It did not disclose how many students were expelled or suspended but said that decisions were made based on the severity of each student’s actions, reported news agency Associated Press.The move follows pressure from the Trump administration, which recently cut over $400 million in federal funding , accusing the university of failing to address antisemitism on campus .The April 2024 protests began with a tent encampment, which later escalated when a smaller group of students barricaded themselves inside Hamilton Hall using furniture and padlocks. At the request of university officials, New York police forcibly removed the protesters, arresting dozens. Although 31 of the 46 arrested students had their trespassing charges dropped, they still faced university disciplinary hearings.The announcement comes amid the arrest of Palestinian student activist Mahmoud Khalil by federal immigration authorities last Saturday. Trump has said that Khalil’s arrest is “the first of many.” At the same time, House Republicans are demanding disciplinary records of students involved in the protests, threatening further financial penalties if the university does not comply.Also read: 'Free Mahmoud, free them all': Protesters take over Trump Tower, NYC demanding Columbia student's release On Thursday, Khalil and seven other students filed a lawsuit in federal court to block Congress from obtaining their records.

US President Donald Trump ’s border czar, Tom Homan on Wednesday warned migrant ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions, urging them to ""get out of the way"" or face an increased presence of ""exactly what they don’t want, more ICE agents in the community.""While visiting the New York state Capitol , Homan criticised Gov. Kathy Hochul and state Democrats for backing sanctuary city policies, cautioning, ""Sanctuary cities are going to get exactly what they don’t want—more agents in the community.""""You’re not going to stop us, New York state, you’ve got to change the sanctuary status.

Rather than one officer arresting a bad guy, now I have to send a whole team,"" he added.New York's state legislation prevents state and local law enforcement from following ICE detainer requests or detaining undocumented immigrants solely on immigration status grounds.Additionally, the ""Green Light Law"" enables undocumented immigrants to acquire New York state-valid driving licences.At the state Capitol building, accompanied by Republican state legislators, Homan reaffirmed his commitment to prioritise deportation of serious offenders and criticised non-cooperation policies like New York's, stating they endanger federal agents and local communities.Homan called on local and state law enforcement to grant ICE access to jails voluntarily but emphasized that sanctuary policies would not hinder the Trump administration’s deportation efforts. ""This is an attack on immigration enforcement , that’s plain what it is,"" he added.Homan criticised Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul, who supports deporting criminal undocumented immigrants but opposes Trump's recent immigration measures.""She’s talking out of both sides of her mouth, saying, ‘I want criminal aliens to be deported,’ while she wants all the roadblocks [so that] it’s not happening,"" he said.""Releasing a public safety threat back into the public is just stupid, it’s just common sense.

The passenger, identified as 31-year-old Delange Augustin, was travelling with his sister Medjina Augustin.According to an FBI affidavit filed on Tuesday in US District Court, Augustin had instructed his sister to ""close her eyes and pray because Satan’s disciple(s) had followed them onto the plane.""The Envoy Air-operated flight, carrying eight passengers, saw no serious injuries, while Augustin faces multiple charges, including misdemeanor battery, obstruction of police and felony criminal property damage.FBI Agent Savannah Solomon described the incident, stating that flight attendants initially suspected the passenger was experiencing an epileptic episode shortly after takeoff.As the crew observed his erratic behavior—including ""stomping, incoherent yelling, and shaking"" concern grew. When a flight attendant approached to check on him, the passenger suddenly turned and forcefully kicked the attendant in the chest, propelling them into a window across the aisle.The passenger then began aggressively kicking and punching the seat in front of him, causing the occupant to move just before the seatback gave way.Upon landing back in Savannah, the passenger attempted to rush toward the exit, attacking another flight attendant in the process.

"What is the Alien Enemies Act, meant for wartime, that Trump is expected to invoke for mass deportations?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-alien-enemies-act-meant-for-wartime-that-trump-is-expected-to-invoke-for-mass-deportations/articleshow/118993651.cms,"Donald Trump is expected to invoke Alien Enemies Act.

President Donald Trump is expected to invoke the Alien Enemies Act , reports said to give an impetus to his mass deportation programs. The Act is a wartime law that allows the president to decide to deport immigrants from an enemy nation. During his campaign, Trump said that he planned to invoke the Acy which has not been used since World War II, when it was used to detain Japanese Americans.During World War II, the Alien Enemies Act was partially used to justify the internment of Japanese immigrants who had not become U.S. citizens. The broader internment of Japanese-Americans was carried out under executive orders signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and not the Alien Enemies Act since the law does not apply to U.S. citizens.The other two occasions the Act was invoked were also during war.The law is designed to be invoked if the US is at war with another country, or a foreign nation has invaded the US or threatened to do so. Legal experts say it would be difficult for Trump to use the act when the US isn’t being attacked by a foreign government, even if the administration does cite threats from gangs or cartels.The primary target of the law would be Tren de Aragua , the Venezuelan organized crime group that has become active in the US. Trump earlier ordered his administration to designate Tren as a terrorist organization. Once enacted, the law will help the mass deportation programs too, experts said.The Act requires the president to declare the event that prompted the Act to be invoked. And it will remain in effect until the president terminates it.On January 20, Trump ordered his administration to prepare for the implementation of the Act is he decided that foreign drug cartels qualified as an ""invasion"" or ""predatory incursion"" for invoking the Act.","The Act is a wartime law that allows the president to decide to deport immigrants from an enemy nation.

Mysterious disappearance of Sudiksha Konanki: Here's what we know so far



What happened on March 6?



Days after dismissing the disappearance of 20-year-old University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki -- of Indian origin -- as an accidental drowning, Dominican Republic police Thursday said they have not ruled out foul play in her disappearance as the search for her enters its seventh day. The attorney general and police in the Caribbean nation said in a release that the search for the missing co-ed now extends “beyond an accidental event” and “examines all variables.”“We are using all our resources to thoroughly investigate the disappearance of Konanki Sudiksha Chowdary and we understand the anguish this case causes to her family, Dominicans, and Americans,” Dominican Republic Attorney General Yeni Berenice Reynoso said in a statement.“As with any disappearance occurring under the circumstances of the case at hand, we are applying a holistic investigation protocol that examines all variables,” she said.“The young woman’s family, as well as Dominican and American society, must be absolutely certain that we will continue to investigate until we have the response that we, the authorities, are duty-bound to guarantee.”Interpol issued a yellow notice to wooden the search for Konanki after the Loudoun County Sheriff's office in Virginia, where Konanki's family lives, requested for it to assist in the investigation.The Dominican National Police said they were alerted on March 7 that the 20-year-old girl had gone missing. Konanki arrived in Punta Cana with five friends on March 3.Police have identified Joshua Riibe, a 24-year-old tourist from Iowa, as a person of interest in the case as he was seen last with Konanki -- as captured in surveillance cameras.Konanki's family did not accept that she had been drowned as her body had not been found even after such an intensive search for days. One possibility is that her body might have got trapped in coral reefs.Riu Republica, the resort where Konanki was staying, reportedly experienced a 25-hour power outage in some areas of the hotel before Konanki's disappearance. But the hotel said that the electricity was restored a full day before Konanki disappeared.Police said on March 6, Konanki and a group of five women and two men were seen drinking in the hotel lobby before walking to the beach around 4:15 am. Konanki, however, did not join them on the beach and stayed behind with Riibe.A local news outlet reported that a man claimed that he and Konanki went into the water. He returned to the beach and passed out, he said. When he woke up, Konanki was not there. Some of Konanki's clothes were found on a beach chair, the outlet reported.","Sudiksha Konanki, 20, went missing on March 6 in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic.

Who is the Balochistan Liberation Army



Militants hijacked a train in southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday, holding passengers hostage for nearly 36 hours. The Pakistani military later announced on Wednesday that a successful rescue operation had ended the standoff, freeing the hostages and eliminating over 30 militants.Earlier on Tuesday, Mehboob Hussain was travelling when an explosion damaged the tracks beneath the front carriage. The nine-coach Jaffar Express came to a stop in the isolated Bolan Pass of central Pakistan, an area devoid of internet and mobile connectivity. Subsequently, gunfire erupted.""I was a passenger on the train that was attacked,"" Hussain told BBC Urdu. He and roughly 440 fellow passengers were travelling from Quetta to Peshawar through Balochistan province when armed militants launched their attack, bombing the tracks, shooting at the train and boarding the carriages.Officials report that 300 passengers have been rescued, whilst 33 BLA militants, 21 civilian hostages and four military personnel lost their lives. However, fate of several passengers remains uncertain, with reports from Reuters and AFP suggesting some militants departed with an unknown number of hostages.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a militant separatist group operating in Pakistan's Balochistan province, quickly claimed responsibility for the train hijacking, threatening to kill hostages unless Pakistani authorities released Baloch political prisoners.BBC interviewed several witnesses who recounted the terrifying events aboard the train during the attack. ""We held our breath throughout the firing, not knowing what would happen next,"" Ishaq Noor a passenger said.A railway police officer aboard the train told the outlet that, contrary to initial official statements, the train was ""not in a tunnel but in an open area"" during the attack.The BLA has shared purported footage of the train explosion. The video displays an exposed track section alongside a substantial rocky incline. The footage shows BLA fighters positioned at the summit of this incline.The officer detailed to the BBC how he initially ""fought together with other police officers"" to resist the militants until ""the ammunition ran out"".""They [the BLA] were moving in front of us on the mountain and they were much more numerous than us, in the hundreds,"" the officer, speaking anonymously, stated.He mentioned being accompanied by four railway police and two Frontier Corps (FC) paramilitary members. ""I told my companion to give me the G-3 rifle because it is a better weapon,"" the officer explained.""When I got the rifle and the rounds, we also started firing back. I used to fire one shot at a time at them so that they could not come near us and the train... [But] in an hour-and-half, our rounds were over... We were helpless,"" he added.After the gunfire from the Jaffar Express subsided, armed militants descended from the mountains and began evacuating passengers. The officer described how they conducted identity checks and segregated hostages based on their ethnicity alongside the train.According to the passengers, the militants issued threats speaking in Balochi stating their demands to the government and warning of severe consequences, including burning the vehicle if their demands weren't met. The officer noted that the militants received instructions to execute people, targeting both military personnel and civilians from the segregated groups.The militants permitted certain groups to leave unharmed, including women, children, elderly individuals and Balochistan residents, according to Noor.Noor Muhammad, who was amongst those released, described how armed men entered the train after an hour of gunfire, demanding passengers to exit under threat.Muhammad and his wife were escorted off the train and instructed to walk straight ahead without looking back. They reached Panir Railway Station at about 1900 after a challenging journey through wilderness. His wife recounted their rescue by Pakistan military personnel who transported them safely to Machh and subsequently to their waiting children in Quetta.The police official, speaking anonymously, described how numerous BLA militants began departing as night fell. ""Many of them hugged each other and 70, 80 people left while 20, 25 stayed behind,"" he said.Violence erupted again around 10pm when some attempted to flee. ""Some people tried to run away, they [the BLA] saw them and opened fire, then everyone fell to the ground,"" the official added.Mehboob another passenger further recounted continuous gunfire throughout the night and described how a person near him, a father of five daughters, was shot.""When someone is killed in front of your eyes, you don't know what to do,"" he said.Another passenger, Allahditta, recounted how the BLA killed his cousin before his eyes. He mentioned that his cousin begged for his life, citing his young daughters, but ""his life was not spared"".The rescue operation began during Wednesday morning prayers when FC forces engaged the militants. Amidst the chaos, several hostages managed to escape.The police official described fleeing with his injured companion, carrying him beyond the firing range with assistance from another person. Mehboob, Allahdita, the police official and his companion survived the ordeal during the FC's intervention.The Balochistan Liberation Army has been fighting for an independent Baloch state and has intensified attacks in recent years, targeting security forces, infrastructure, and foreign investments, particularly Chinese projects.While the group has a history of attacking military camps, railway stations, and trains, this marked the first time they had hijacked a train.","Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) militants hijacked a train in southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday, holding passengers hostage for nearly 36 hours.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s military said it had thwarted a daring suicide attack on a Frontier Corps (FC) camp in Jandola area of Tank district, in the country’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, on Thursday, killing 10 suspected militants affiliated with the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).The assault on the FC (a paramilitary force), which began with a massive explosion and turned into a fierce gun battle, marks the second major militant attack in Pakistan this week, underscoring growing security threats in the region.The attack commenced in the early hours when a suicide bomber detonated a vehicle packed with explosives near the perimeter of Jandola base in the restive tribal district near the Afghan border. The blast tore through the camp’s defences, paving the way for an armed assault by TTP fighters. Security forces responded swiftly, engaging the attackers in a prolonged exchange of heavy gunfire. By mid-morning, the military declared the situation under control, reporting that all assailants had been neutralised.“The brave soldiers of the Frontier Corps stood their ground and eliminated the threat with precision,” said a spokesperson for the Pakistan military’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). “Ten terrorists were sent to their deaths in this operation, proving once again our resolve to protect the nation.”While official statements did not disclose casualties among security personnel or civilians, unverified reports circulating on social media platforms, including X, suggested significant damage to the camp and hinted at dozens of potential casualties. Authorities have yet to confirm these claims, and details remain scarce as the area has been cordoned off.The TTP, a militant group seeking to overthrow Pakistani governance in the tribal regions, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement released shortly after the incident. The assault comes just two days after another deadly attack in Balochistan, where Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) militants hijacked the Jaffar Express train, killing 21 hostages and four soldiers before being eliminated by security forces.Analysts see the Jandola attack as part of a broader resurgence of militancy in Pakistan’s border regions, fuelled by instability in neighbouring Afghanistan and the TTP’s renewed aggression. “This is a clear escalation,” said security expert Ayesha Khan in Islamabad. “The TTP is testing the military’s defences, and the proximity to the Afghan border only complicates the response.”Local residents reported hearing a loud explosion followed by hours of gunfire, with some describing the scene as chaotic. “We hid in our homes, praying it would end soon,” said Javed Khan, a shopkeeper near Jandola. “The army fought hard, but it’s a reminder that we’re never far from danger here.”",Pakistan’s military said it had thwarted a daring suicide attack on a Frontier Corps (FC) camp. 10 suspected militants affiliated with the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed.

ISLAMABAD: Talks between Islamabad and Kabul aimed to resolve a grave border standoff broke down after the 17-member Afghan delegation walked out, accusing Pakistan of not taking the negotiations seriously, official sources said on Thursday.The cross-border movement of people via Torkham border crossing, a critical trade and transit point between Pakistan and Afghanistan, was abruptly suspended on Feb 21 after Pakistani and Afghan security forces developed differences over construction activities on both sides of the border. The situation worsened this month when eight people, including six troops, were injured after Pakistan and Afghan Taliban forces traded fire at the border. A number of houses, a mosque and some clearing agents’ offices were hit by artillery, and cross-border firing continued for three days.To address the issue, both sides had formed their jirgas — traditional assemblies of tribal elders and representatives — which held its first meeting this week in which both sides agreed to a ceasefire. The talks, however, broke down on Wednesday when the Afghan delegation, led by Younus Mohmand, chairman of the Afghan chamber of commerce, walked out.The Afghan delegation was surprised to find that Pakistan had expanded its delegation list without prior consultation. Instead of the agreed 17 members, Pakistan presented a list of 70 individuals, many of whom the Afghan side considered irrelevant to negotiations.After waiting two hours for a response, the Afghan jirga left for Kabul, expressing frustration with Pakistan’s approach. Mohmand criticised Pakistan’s actions, stating that the addition of unrelated individuals reflected a lack of seriousness in resolving the dispute.The collapse of talks highlights the fragile state of Afghanistan-Pakistan relations , especially over border issues like the Durand Line, which Afghanistan does not officially recognise. Pakistani customs officials at Torkham said the border closure was causing a loss of around $1.5 million daily as exports to Afghanistan have stopped. Additionally, $2 million in revenue has been lost due to suspension of imports from Afghanistan.","Talks between Islamabad and Kabul aimed to resolve a grave border standoff broke down.

Nepal’s former King Gyanendra Shah was greeted with the chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday, amid growing calls for the reinstatement of the monarchy and Nepal’s status as a Hindu state.According to the news agency AFP, Shah’s supporters waved Nepal’s flag and chanted slogans like ""Come king, save the nation!"" as the 77-year-old former monarch stepped out of Tribhuvan International Airport following a tour of western Nepal.The crowd, which included members of the pro-monarchist Rastriya Prajatantra Party , carried placards reading ""We want our King back"" and ""Abolish federal republican system and reinstate the monarchy.""AP reported that an estimated 10,000 supporters gathered outside the airport, blocking its main entrance. Passengers were forced to walk to and from the airport due to the heavy crowd. Riot police were deployed to prevent demonstrators from entering the premises, but no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 240-year-old monarchy in 2008 after a decade-long civil war that left over 16,000 dead. However, dissatisfaction with political instability, corruption and economic struggles has fuelled a resurgence of support for the former royal family.“The country faces instability, prices are high, people are jobless, and there is a lack of education and healthcare facilities,” said Rajindra Kunwar, a teacher who joined the rally who was quoted by AFP. “The poor are dying of hunger. The law applies to the public, but not to politicians. That’s why we need the king back”, Kunwar added.Nepal has had 13 different governments since 2008, with growing frustration over governance issues. Some protesters, including those who previously supported the abolition of the monarchy, have now changed their stance. “I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken,” said Kulraj Shrestha, a carpenter. “The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind”, Shrestha added.Gyanendra, who has generally remained silent on political matters, has made several public appearances recently. On the eve of Nepal’s Democracy Day last month, he issued a statement saying, ""It is now time. If we wish to save our nation and maintain national unity, I call on all countrymen to support us for Nepal's prosperity and progress.""Despite the rising pro-monarchy sentiment, political analyst Lok Raj Baral told AFP that the monarchy's return is unlikely, stating that it was ""a source of instability."" He added, ""For some disgruntled groups, it has become a retreat due to the incompetence of politicians.""As per PTI, security was heightened in Kathmandu, with dozens of riot policemen deployed around Narayanhiti Palace Museum, the former royal residence. There were rumours that Gyanendra might attempt to enter the palace with his supporters but the former king proceeded to his private residence, Nirmal Niwas, without any incident.The movement for the monarchy’s restoration has been gaining traction since February, when Gyanendra’s Democracy Day statement reignited debate on Nepal’s future political system.Bollywood actress Manisha Koirala, who is the granddaughter of Nepal’s first elected Prime Minister BP Koirala, urged Nepalis on social media to gather at the airport to welcome the former monarch.","Nepal's former King Gyanendra Shah greeted with chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday.

Can Gyanendra return to power?

Chants of ""Long live our beloved king"" and ""Vacate the royal palace for the king"" echoed through the streets of Kathmandu on Sunday as thousands of supporters of Nepal's former king, Gyanendra Shah , gathered to demand the restoration of the monarchy and Hinduism as the state religion.An estimated 10,000 royalists blocked the main entrance to Tribhuvan International Airport as Gyanendra returned from a tour of western Nepal. Protesters waved flags and carried banners calling for the former king’s reinstatement. The demonstration disrupted airport operations, forcing passengers to walk to and from the terminal, while hundreds of riot police prevented demonstrators from entering the airport. Despite the intensity of the protest, no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule. The country became a federal democratic republic, but since then, many Nepalis have grown frustrated with political instability and economic struggles.Since the abolition of the monarchy, Nepal has seen 13 different governments, leading many to believe the current system has failed. Corruption, economic hardship, and lack of political stability have left some citizens reconsidering their stance on monarchy.""We are here to give the king our full support and to rally behind him all the way to reinstating him in the royal throne,"" said Thir Bahadur Bhandari, a 72-year-old protester.Kulraj Shrestha, a 50-year-old carpenter, admitted he had initially opposed the monarchy but had since changed his mind. ""I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken. The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind,"" he said.Despite the growing support, Gyanendra has not commented on the renewed calls for his return. Political analysts believe his chances of regaining the throne remain slim in the near future. The republic is constitutionally enshrined, and mainstream political parties remain opposed to reinstating the monarchy.Gyanendra, who first became king in 2002 after the tragic massacre of his brother King Birendra and his family, initially ruled as a constitutional monarch. However, in 2005, he seized absolute power, dissolving the government and parliament, jailing politicians and journalists, and imposing emergency rule. His authoritarian rule led to the mass protests that ultimately resulted in the abolition of the monarchy.","Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule.

On International Women's Day, the Taliban issued a statement asserting their commitment to safeguarding the rights of Afghan women.Chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid posted on his official X account, stating that the ''Islamic Emirate assumes full responsibility for the provision and safeguarding of the rights of Afghan women.''Without directly referencing International Women's Day, Mujahid said that dignity, honor, and legal rights for women remain a priority for the Taliban government.He claimed that Afghan women ''live in security, both physically and psychologically''and that their ''fundamental rights'' — such as autonomy in marital decisions, dowry entitlements, and inheritance — are protected.The Taliban's statement comes as the United Nations continues to denounce the severe restrictions on Afghan women.Since seizing control in 2021, the Taliban have imposed sweeping bans on education and employment for women. Girls were barred from secondary education, and later, from attending and teaching at Kabul University.In August 2023, the Vice and Virtue Ministry expanded restrictions, prohibiting women's voices in public and mandating full face coverings outside the home.On Saturday, the UN renewed its call for these bans to be lifted. ''The erasure of women and girls from public life cannot be ignored,'' said Roza Otunbayeva, head of the UN mission in Afghanistan.Alison Davidian, special representative for UN Women Afghanistan, added, ""We must stand with Afghan women as if our own lives depend on it — because they do.""Mujahid emphasized distinctions in Afghan and Western notions of women's rights. He said ''Afghan women's rights are situated within the specific context of an Islamic and Afghan society, which exhibits distinct divergences from Western societies and their cultural paradigms.''The Taliban remain globally isolated, with no official recognition as running Afghanistan's government due to their policies on women. In January, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor requested arrest warrants for two senior Taliban officials for their role in repressing Afghan women.Last Friday, Unesco hosted a high-level conference on women and girls in Afghanistan, featuring activists, parliamentarians, and rights experts. They included Hamida Aman, founder of the women-only station Radio Begum, former Afghan lawmaker Fawzia Koofi and human rights expert Richard Bennett, who has been barred from entering Afghanistan.In response, Saif ul-Islam Khyber, a spokesman for the Vice and Virtue Ministry, dismissed such gatherings, calling them an ''exposure of the hypocrisy of certain organizations and European Union foundations.''","The Taliban issued a statement asserting their commitment to safeguarding the rights of Afghan women.

DHAKA: Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus voiced strong concern over recent reports of attacks on women, calling them ""deeply troubling"" and a clear deviation from the vision of a ""New Bangladesh"" that the nation's people strive for.His comment, made at an International Women's Day event, came in the aftermath of the harrowing plight of an eight-year-old girl who is fighting for her life after being allegedly raped. This case is not an isolated incident but part of a broader, grim trend of sexual violence that has plagued the country. Reports of rape, gang rape, sexual assault and harassment have become disturbingly frequent.Addressing the situation of violence against women in Bangladesh that remained troubling since last year, with shocking numbers reported in the first two months, Fauzia Moslem, president of Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, said, ""Society is descending into chaos, where lawlessness and criminal impunity are growing. The failure of law enforcement, compromises, and lack of accountability are empowering criminals.""A report by the Manabadhikar Shongskriti Foundation (MSF) in Dhaka revealed that Feb 2025 documented 295 incidents of violence against women and children, 24 more than in Jan. It noted that Islamic fundamentalist groups, terrorists, and other extremist elements play a visible role in these incidents.A total of 21 women from various professions told local media that they experienced sexual harassment outside the home in past three months. The women, aged between 19 and 48 and residing in Dhaka, reported multiple instances.According to Dhaka-based human rights organisation Ain o Salish Kendra, in Feb, 46 women were victims of rape, 22 of whom were under 18. In Jan, this number was 39, including 15 minors.(With inputs from ANI)","Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus voiced strong concern over recent reports of attacks on women.

Queen Camilla Support GisèLe Pelicot: Queen Camilla writes to French rape survivor Gisèle Pelicot in a gesture of support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/queen-camilla-writes-to-french-rape-survivor-gisle-pelicot-in-a-gesture-of-support/articleshow/118979434.cms,"Queen Camilla writes to French rape survivor Gisèle Pelicot in a gesture of support (Picture credit: AP, ANI)

UK’s Queen Camilla sent a private letter of support to French rape survivor Gisèle Pelicot , recognising her “extraordinary dignity and courage”, reported Newsweek quoting a palace aide.""She was tremendously affected by the Madame Pelicot case in France and that lady’s extraordinary dignity and courage as she put herself in the public eye,"" a palace source was quoted as saying by the news outlet. ""Because, as she rightly put it, why should she be made to feel like a victim or hide away in shame?”, the source added.According to Newsweek, The Queen wanted to reach out personally to acknowledge Pelicot’s resilience and the impact she has made in highlighting a significant societal issue.""So, as a long-term supporter of survivors of domestic and sexual abuse, the Queen wrote to Madame Pelicot privately. It was very much her instigation and determination to write to express support from the highest level,"" the source said.Pelicot, 72, endured nearly a decade of horrific abuse at the hands of her former husband, Dominique Pelicot, who drugged, raped, and filmed her, while also enlisting dozens of other men to do the same.The abuse, which occurred between 2011 and 2020, was uncovered when Dominique was caught filming women up their skirts in a supermarket. Upon investigation, authorities discovered a hard drive containing over 200 videos documenting the crimes.Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to 20 years in prison in December 2024 after standing trial alongside 50 co-defendants, most of whom were also convicted of rape or sexual assault. The scale of the abuse made it France’s largest-ever rape trial, drawing widespread media attention.Gisèle Pelicot made headlines for waiving her anonymity and choosing to face her 51 alleged rapists in court. She explained her decision as an effort to make the ""shame swap sides"", ensuring that perpetrators, not victims, carried the stigma of sexual violence. Her bravery earned her praise across France and internationally, with supporters lining up outside the court to applaud her and present her with flowers, BBC reported.Queen Camilla has been an active advocate against domestic and sexual violence for years. In November, ITV aired a documentary following her campaign work, where she urged for a cultural shift to end violence against women and open conversations on abuse.She has also visited numerous charities supporting survivors. In February, she visited Brave Spaces in Exeter, England, which is a two-year test and learn project and supports women facing multiple disadvantages, homelessness, trauma, and domestic and sexual violence. There she met women rebuilding their lives after domestic violence.""The Queen is a great advocate for women,"" Newsweek quoted Afnan Tellesy, 37, after meeting Camilla at the charity.","Queen Camilla writes to French rape survivor Gisèle Pelicot in a gesture of support.
