GANDHINAGAR: A plume of smoke rose above BJ Medical College on the sunny afternoon of June 12. Flames licked the crumpled fuselage of a jumbo jet. Screams pierced the air. Raju Patel, 56, didn't stop to think. When the sky fell, he stood up.Just minutes away, the construction businessman raced to the AI 171 crash site with his crew, arriving within five minutes of impact. ""For the first 15 to 20 minutes, we could barely get close. The fire was too intense,"" Patel said. ""But once the first fire brigade and 108 ambulances arrived, we jumped in to help.""With no stretchers in sight, they used sarees and bedsheets to carry the injured. ""We did what we could,"" he said. Authorities allowed Patel's team to stay on-site until 9 pm.As emergency services took control, Patel's team turned to what came next - combing the wreckage. Burned luggage lay scattered across the charred grounds. From the debris, they retrieved 70 tolas (over 800 grams) of gold jewellery, Rs 80,000 in cash, passports, and a Bhagawad Gita. All were handed over to the police.Minister of state for home Harsh Sanghavi said Sunday that all salvaged personal belongings are being documented and will be returned to the next of kin.""I'm just grateful we could do something,"" said Patel, whose volunteering history includes the 2008 Ahmedabad serial blasts. ""I was just 100m from the civil hospital when a bomb went off. But the destruction here... the flames... I will never forget this,"" he added.","Raju Patel, 56, arrived at the AI 171 crash site within five minutes of impact. He and his crew used sarees and bedsheets to carry the injured.

Nilambur bypoll is Congress’s semi-final in Kerala



Kaliganj heats up amid riot shadow



Ludhiana West Bypoll a Crucial Test for AAP, Congress, SAD and BJP



Gujarat gears up for bypolls in Visavadar and Kadi



NEW DELHI: Interest around assembly byelections is mostly limited to the states, more so, if the contest does not involve heavyweights. However, the assembly bypolls today for 5 seats spread across four states will be keenly watched when the results are out on June 23 - as this will be the first electoral contest post Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor - India's military response that included air and ground strikes on terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).Today's bypolls include two assembly seats in Gujarat, one each in Kerala, West Bengal and Punjab. The fact that assembly elections are due in two of these states - Kerala and West Bengal early next year - makes this mini electoral contest all the more interesting.Congress, which has huge stakes in Kerala, has already announced that the Nilambur by-election is the semi-final before the 2026 assembly polls. Kerala LoP and Congress MLA VD Satheesan has claimed that victory in the bypoll will mark the beginning of the United Democratic Front's (UDF) return to the state.""This is a political contest, a direct fight between the UDF and the LDF. It is the semi-final leading up to the 2026 Assembly elections, and we are confident of winning by a significant margin. We see this as an opportunity to hold the Pinarayi government accountable, a government that has been in power for the past nine years,"" Satheesan said.Congress got a boost with Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra joining the campaign to secure a win for the party.Congress, which has lost two consecutive elections in the state to the Left Democratic Front, will be keen to settle scores and return to power. However, given party's choppy relations with Shashi Tharoor, who is MP from Thiruvananthpuram, and a resurgent BJP going all out to spread its influence in the state, the road to power will not be easy for the grand old party.Moving over to West Bengal - another state where assembly elections are due early next year, the Kaliganj assembly bypoll in the state's Nadia district is shaping up to be a triangular contest among the TMC, BJP, and Congress-Left alliance.The electoral discourse here in the run up to the bypoll has been dominated by identity politics, post-Murshidabad riot anxieties and a nationalist surge after Operation Sindoor.The bypoll is also being closely watched due to the recent Murshidabad riots in which three persons were killed and several people rendered homeless, discontent over the SSC recruitment scam, and the changing electoral arithmetic since the 2024 general elections.In Kaliganj, identity and legacy remain central to the electoral battle. While the TMC has accused the BJP of communal polarisation, the Murshidabad riots and sporadic communal skirmishes in parts of the state have only added fuel to the saffron party's campaign in its bid to break the Trinamool Congress stronghold on this minority-dominated seat.The Ludhiana West by-election, set to take place on Thursday, is shaping up to be a high-stakes political showdown that could redefine the urban political narrative in Punjab. While the seat itself is just one among many, the implications of this bypoll stretch far beyond its borders.For the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the contest is a crucial opportunity to reaffirm its dominance in Punjab following the death of its sitting MLA, Gurpreet Bassi Gogi, in January. Retaining the seat would help AAP maintain its urban clout and narrative of continuity.Facing off against AAP is the Congress, looking to claw back a constituency it once firmly held—six times in the past. A win here would signal a revival of urban support for the party, which has struggled to reclaim lost ground in the state since AAP’s rise.However, the contest isn’t only a two-way battle. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is also keenly watching the outcome to assess its urban appeal in Punjab, a state where it remains on the fringes post its breakup with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).For the SAD, the stakes are equally high. The bypoll is being viewed as a test of leadership for party president Sukhbir Singh Badal, whose party is still trying to bounce back from a string of electoral defeats. A respectable showing here could breathe some life into the party’s flagging morale.By-elections in Gujarat’s Visavadar and Kadi assembly constituencies will be held on Thursday, with the BJP, Congress, and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) locked in a three-cornered battle in both seats. Voting will take place from 7 am to 8 pm, and results will be declared on June 23, according to election officials.The Visavadar seat in Junagadh, vacant since former AAP MLA Bhupendra Bhayani defected to the BJP in December 2023, has attracted high-profile candidates. The BJP has fielded Kirit Patel, Congress has nominated Nitin Ranpariya, while AAP has placed its former Gujarat president Gopal Italia, in the contest.In Kadi (Mehsana district), a seat reserved for Scheduled Caste (SC) candidates and lying vacant since BJP MLA Karsan Solanki’s death in February, the ruling party has fielded Rajendra Chavda. Congress has turned to Ramesh Chavda, a former MLA who won the seat in 2012, while AAP is banking on Jagdish Chavda.Polling will take place through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) at 294 stations in each constituency. Gujarat government has also declared a public holiday in both constituencies on polling day to encourage voter participation.","Today's bypolls include two assembly seats in Gujarat, one each in Kerala, West Bengal and Punjab.

Delhi Judge Cash Row: Modi Govt Likely To Move Impeachment Motion Against Justice Varma

NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha MP and senior advocate Kapil Sibal on Tuesday called Justice Yashwant Varma ""one of the finest judges"" and criticised the central government for initiating impeachment proceedings against Varma, in whose storeroom a huge amount of cash was found.Saibal alleged that the government's ""real motive"" behind the action against Varma is to ""dismantle"" the Collegium system and ""gain control over judicial appointments"".He also accused the government of selectively pursuing the case against Varma while ignoring similar proceedings against Justice Shekhar Yadav, who faces an impeachment notice from Opposition MPs over allegedly ""communal"" remarks made last year.""I can say with the utmost of responsibility that he (Varma) is one of the finest judges that I have argued before. You ask any lawyer in the High Court or the Supreme Court, and there is not a whiff of any wrongdoing by this judge. You ask any lawyer in Allahabad (Prayagraj)...judges know their lawyers...lawyers also know the judges,"" Sibal was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.He furher said: ""It is shocking that you (the government) are targeting a judge against whom there is no evidence and you are protecting a judge against whom there is no evidence required because his statement is in the public domain and there is an impeachment motion pending before the Chairman and he has been sitting on it for verification of signatures.""Rijiju is reportedly planning to introduce a motion on the first day of the upcoming Monsoon session of Parliament to make the Supreme Court's in-house inquiry report on Justice Varma public.""For what? Why are you protecting Shekhar Yadav?"" Sibal questioned.The senior advocate alleged that the opposition is failing to recognise the broader agenda to strip the Collegium of its authority and reinstate the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC).""This is the whole purpose of this exercise,"" Sibal claimed.Criticising the government’s handling of the matter, Sibal said a decision was taken against a sitting high court judge without following due process.""The judge was not even heard. This is absolutely shocking...Unfortunately, the political class is brought into the act,"" he remarked.The controversy surfaced after a fire incident at Justice Varma's residence in Delhi in March, during his tenure at the Delhi high court. The blaze reportedly led to the discovery of several burnt sacks of cash in an outhouse on the property.However, contrary to Sibal's claims, a three-judge inquiry panel's damning report to CJI Sanjiv Khanna confirmed that a huge amount of cash was found in a storeroom at Justice Yashwant Varma's Tughlaq Crescent residence on March 14.The report repudiated Justice Varma's repeated statements claiming innocence about the discovery of money from a room within his official residence.","Rajya Sabha MP Kapil Sibal called Justice Yashwant Varma ""one of the finest judges"" Sibal criticised the central government for initiating impeachment proceedings against Varma.

'Will Skin Them Alive': Iranians Make Huge DECLARATION Against Israel Amid Threat To Khamenei





Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in series of posts on early Wednesday warned the ""terrorist Zionist regime"" and said “the battle begins” amid escalating tensions with Israel. Khamenei's post came following escalating threats from US President Donald Trump, who had just hours before called for Iran’s “unconditional surrender.""Moments later, Khamenei posted on X: “We must give a strong response to the terrorist Zionist regime. We will show the Zionists no mercy.” The statement came shortly after Iran launched two rounds of ballistic missiles at Israel early Wednesday.Khamenei’s posts appeared to frame the attacks as part of a broader ideological struggle. In Farsi, he posted “the battle begins”, alongside an image of a man with a sword entering a castle gate, alluding to the historic battle of Khaybar, as per the Times of Israel.In a series of posts on his platform Truth Social Trump had claimed the United States had full control of Iranian airspace and warned that the country’s top leader was within reach. “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,” Trump had wrote.“But we don’t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” He later followed up with a post calling for Iran's “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!”Iran fired the latest barrage of missiles around 12.40 am which triggered sirens across of Israel and included around 15 projectiles. A second wave of about 10 rockets followed roughly 40 minutes later, prompting alerts in central parts of the country and the West Bank. Although there were no reported casualties, a fire broke out in a central Israeli parking lot, damaging several cars.Warning sirens were also activated around the Dead Sea due to what officials described as a suspected drone infiltration.Read: How Iran’s Supreme Commander Ayatollah Ali Khamenei lost his top commanders Meanwhile, Israel continued its offensive inside Iranian territory. Early Wednesday morning, the Israel defense forces (IDF) called for residents of Tehran’s District 18 to evacuate, citing upcoming military action targeting strategic infrastructure. Soon after, Israeli forces confirmed a new wave of airstrikes in Tehran. Reports also emerged of explosions in the city of Karaj, previously the site of a nuclear centrifuge facility targeted by Israeli strikes.Israel launched its military campaign six days ago, calling the assault necessary to dismantle what it described as an “existential threat” posed by Iran’s nuclear and missile programmes. According to Israeli officials, the ongoing operation aims to eliminate top Iranian military officials, nuclear scientists, missile launch sites and uranium enrichment centres.The conflict has already caused significant casualties. Iranian authorities report at least 224 people killed in Israeli strikes, while Israel says over 370 missiles and hundreds of drones have been launched by Iran.

Israel-Iran war: Donald Trump may consider joining Israel in striking Iranian nuclear sites; report claims growing US involvement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/israel-iran-war-donald-trump-may-consider-joining-israel-in-striking-nuclear-sites-report-claims-growing-us-involvement/articleshow/121918496.cms,"



US President Donald Trump is weighing the possibility of US involvement in Israel’s ongoing strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, multiple officials familiar with the matter told CBS News.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One early Tuesday, Trump made his stance clear. “I’m not too much in the mood to negotiate with Iran,” he said, adding that his goal is a permanent solution: “an end, a real end, not a ceasefire.”Later, on Truth Social, Trump doubled down, calling for Iran’s “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!” and stating that the US knows “exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now.”US defence officials had made arrangements anticipating Trump's potential directive for the US Air Force to support Israeli fighter aircraft with refuelling during their operations over Iran, two sources told CNN.These sources indicated that this consideration partly explains why more than 30 aerial refuelling tankers have been deployed to the region in recent days.Refueling Israeli jets midair would be one of the least aggressive forms of support.Still, CENTCOM has presented Trump with the possibility of joint US-Israel strikes on nuclear facilities.Vice President JD Vance echoed the urgency, posting on X that Trump “may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment. That decision ultimately belongs to the president.”Trump met with his national security team in the White House Situation Room on Tuesday. Israeli officials, who have been urging US involvement, expressed optimism but said no formal decision from the US had been conveyed yet.While Trump had previously avoided direct military involvement beyond missile defense and intelligence sharing, his recent statements — including “we now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran” — suggest a shift.“Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment, and plenty of it, but it doesn’t compare to American made, conceived, and manufactured ‘stuff.’ Nobody does it better than the good ol’ USA,” he wrote on Truth Social.After Israel launched strikes on Iran early Friday, it claimed Iran was rapidly advancing toward building nuclear weapons.However, a US intelligence report earlier this year said Iran was not pursuing a nuclear bomb, though mounting pressure may be pushing the regime to restart its nuclear program.The International Atomic Energy Agency has reported that Iran has significantly increased its stockpile of near-weapons-grade uranium in recent months. Iran continues to insist its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.While President Trump has not confirmed direct US involvement, his recent posts on Truth Social have stirred speculation. Trump’s increasingly aggressive tone and use of the term “we” in reference to military actions have raised questions about the extent of American involvement.And one of the key targets being considered is Iran’s Fordo nuclear site, a heavily fortified uranium enrichment facility buried deep under a mountain. According to Brett McGurk, a former US official who served under four presidents, “Fordo is the crux of this thing.” Destroying it would deal a major blow to Iran’s nuclear ambitions, but only the US has the firepower to make that happen.Military experts agree that multiple precision strikes by American B-2 bombers would be needed in a carefully coordinated mission. The New York Times reports that the Pentagon has rehearsed this scenario, which involves dropping a series of bombs ""down the same hole"" to penetrate Fordo's deep underground structure.Fordo is located nearly 300 feet beneath a mountain and protected by heavy air defenses. It is widely believed to be Iran’s most likely site for developing nuclear weapons, as it is where Iran has enriched uranium and expanded its stockpile.","US President Donald Trump is weighing the possibility of US involvement in Israel’s ongoing strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, multiple officials familiar with the matter told CBS News.

Iran Releases Second Video Of Hypersonic Missile Attack On Israel; Fattah-1 Fired Towards Tel Aviv





Israel may be running dangerously low on its stock of Arrow missile interceptors, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal that cites a senior US official.The warning comes as Israel faces an unprecedented volume of ballistic missile attacks from Iran in the sixth day of full-blown conflict between the two countries.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has not confirmed any shortage and maintains that its air defence systems are successfully intercepting most incoming missiles. “The IDF is prepared and ready to handle any scenario. Unfortunately, we are unable to comment on matters related to munitions,” the military said in a statement.However, the American report suggests that the US has been aware of the problem for months and has quietly bolstered Israel’s defences with additional ground, sea, and air-based systems. The Pentagon has deployed assets including the Patriot and THAAD missile defence systems, while US Navy destroyers are assisting in intercept operations.Israel’s own Arrow system, developed by Israel Aerospace Industries, plays a critical role in intercepting long-range ballistic missiles.But with Iran firing hundreds of missiles in recent days, including the advanced Fatah-1 which Tehran says can escape current defence systems, pressure on Israel’s Arrow missile stock is growing.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards claim these missiles move at hypersonic speeds, making them harder to stop.Tom Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that US and Israel cannot intercept missiles forever.“Neither the US nor the Israelis can continue to sit and intercept missiles all day. The Israelis and their friends need to move with all deliberate haste to do whatever needs to be done, because we cannot afford to sit and play catch,"" Karako said.Meanwhile, Israel has launched a new wave of attacks on Tehran in broad daylight, using over 50 fighter jets.

Who are the seven men?







Seven men from California, including illegal immigrants, have been charged in thefts that the US Attorney's Office call the ""largest jewelry heist in US history"". Starting in March 2022, these men put a system in place where they just walked away with cargo load after cargo load with no bullets being fired or anyone witnessing them doing the massive plunder. And it continued for three years.Prosecutors said the robbery crew was scouting an international jewelry show on July 10, 2022, south of San Francisco in San Mateo when they saw the Brinks truck being loaded with a virtual treasure chest of goods. They followed the truck and when the truck stopped at a gas station about the driver and the guard went inside, these men quickly broke in and picked only some of the bags. Out of 73 bags containing millions of dollars worth of jewelry, they took 24, prosecutors said.Then these men disappeared, deactivated their cellphones and tried to cover their tracks the best.Before that, these men used the same modus operandi to rob a box truck containing Apple AirTags from China, and another semitruck with Samsung electronics.The investigators had a tough job cracking the case as there was no witness, making them rely mostly on surveillance footage and cell phone records. Prosecutors said they did not know how these men were spending any proceeds from the theft.""We don't have any information about them spending lavishly,"" Jena MacCabe, an assistant US Attorney, said. ""I think as we continue to investigate this and look into what's been going on the past few years with these defendants, we'll know more. But right now, I don't know what they've done with all the spoils from this.""Carlos Victor Mestanza Cercado, 31, Pasadena, California.Jazael Padilla Resto, a.k.a.

NAGPUR: A simple act of courtesy and kindness — letting a sick teenager and her grandmother board the helicopter first — spared the lives of a couple from the fatal helicopter crash near Kedarnath on Sunday. Pooja and Pravin Mahajan, from Bhadravati in Chandrapur district, had been travelling with Pooja's sister, Shraddha Jaiswal of Wani in Yavatmal district, her husband Rajkumar, and their two-year-old daughter Kashi, who were among the seven killed when the chopper went down minutes after take-off.On Sunday morning, the group was waiting at the Kedarnath helipad with the Jaiswals for the first sortie to Gaurikund when an elderly woman in the queue requested that she and her unwell granddaughter be allowed to go first. Pravin let them take his family's place in the queue and opting to wait for the next helicopter. Talking to TOI, Mahajan said, ""The woman requested that her granddaughter had fever and she needed to reach the Gaurikund base soon. I allowed them to board,"" he said.The family of Rajkumar Jaiswal, 41, who was a prominent coal transporter from Wani, and the Mahajans had gone to Kedarnath for a pilgrimage on Saturday and were returning to the Gaurikund chopper base after praying at the shrine.Their plan was to return on the same day, but the sorties were cancelled due to bad weather.""We reached the Kedarnath shrine on Saturday at 9.30am.

His elder son, who lives in a hostel, did not join either.Jaiswal, a respected name in coal logistics in the region, was also known for his community engagement and religious nature. In January 2024, he had hosted widely-attended ‘Kashi Shiv Mahapuran Katha' in Wani. The event was inspired by his daughter's name Kashi, said sources. Many in the town remember him as a person who had held the week-long spiritual discourse.

NEW DELHI: A British Royal Navy F-35B fighter jet — one of the world’s most expensive and advanced combat aircraft — remains stranded at Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram International Airport for four days after making an emergency landing.The stealth fighter, valued at over $100 million, was forced to divert to the southern Indian city on Saturday night due to a suspected hydraulic system failure during a routine flight over international waters.It had taken off from the HMS Prince of Wales, the UK’s flagship aircraft carrier currently stationed approximately 100 nautical miles off the Kerala coast.According to sources, although technicians were airlifted by a Royal Navy helicopter to begin repairs the same night, the aircraft remains grounded due to continued technical issues.The F-35 was expected to depart by Tuesday morning but has since been delayed again.The emergency landing occurred at 9.30pm on June 14 after the jet encountered bad weather and was unable to return to the carrier due to choppy sea conditions.The Indian Air Force (IAF), using its IACCS radar network, coordinated with air traffic control to facilitate the unscheduled landing.Thiruvananthapuram airport is a pre-designated diversion location for British naval aircraft operating in the region.Following the landing, the pilot was temporarily seated at the apron control area to keep visual contact with the parked jet until other Royal Navy personnel arrived.Contrary to social media speculation, he was not seated next to the aircraft but was instead moved, along with the incoming technical crew, to the terminal's Emergency Medical Centre for rest.Three Royal Navy personnel — including the pilot and two technicians — remain in Kerala to complete the repair work.Six other technicians, who had arrived on Sunday and Monday, returned to HMS Prince of Wales by helicopter on Tuesday afternoon.An armed detachment of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) is guarding the jet, which is parked in Bay 4 of the airport. A local ground-handling agency has also been arranged at the request of the Royal Navy.Airport authorities have provided accommodation and meals, including Western-style food, as the naval crew were unfamiliar with local cuisine.The F-35B Lightning II, built by Lockheed Martin, is a short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) variant of the fifth-generation fighter and is a central part of the UK’s maritime strike capability.","A British Royal Navy F-35B fighter jet remains stranded at Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram International Airport for four days after making an emergency landing.

The upcoming wedding of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice has polarized the city, with some residents protesting the event while others, including city officials, embrace it. Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro expressed strong support for the couple, stating, “I want Bezos to be welcomed with open arms in Venice. Protesting against those who bring visibility and wealth to our territory is, in my opinion, a disgrace.” Brugnaro, speaking to reporters on Friday, added, “We will have to apologize to Bezos. I am ashamed of those who behave like this. I hope that Bezos comes anyway. Not all Venetians think like these protesters,"" he told protestors.At the Biennale of Architecture, a staple Venice event, sentiments aligned more with city officials. Görge Meyer, a visitor from Berlin, told CNN, “It seems ridiculous that a city that lives off tourism like Venice wouldn’t want an event like this, which will employ hundreds of people from waiters to water taxi drivers. All the guests and journalists will be staying at hotels, eating at restaurants and spending money.”Gillian Longworth McGuire, an American travel writer living in Venice, noted the city’s historical allure for high-profile weddings, saying, “Venice just doesn’t have a clear idea of what it is supposed to be sometimes. Is it a magical place carved out of a lagoon, built by merchants and fishermen, or a bachelorette party and mega wedding venue? The ethos of this city was always that it was the crossroads of culture and the world.”However, not all residents are welcoming. The “No Space for Bezos” collective hung a banner with an X over Bezos’s name on a belltower overlooking the Venice lagoon, which was removed Thursday.

Builder ‘honey-trapped’, blackmailed over photos

Trail of cases and notoriety





SURAT: For over a year, Kirti Patel — also known as Kirti Adalja — managed to stay out of the police’s reach in a high-profile Rs 2 crore extortion case. But that didn’t stop her from flaunting her public appearances, issuing threats online, and uploading videos on Instagram, even as police hunted for her.On Tuesday, the Kapodra police arrested her from a house near Sarkhej police station limits in Ahmedabad.She had been frequently switching phones, SIM cards, and locations, said DCP (Zone-1) Alok Kumar.“She was constantly on the move but active on social media. Her arrest was a result of meticulous technical work,” he said.The case that pushed her name back into alleged honey-trapping of a Surat-based builder, Vaju Katrodiya, on June 2, 2024.According to the FIR, Kirti, along with co-accused Vijay Savani, Zakir Pathan, and Janvi alias Manisha Goswami, lured the builder to a farmhouse under the pretext of resolving a property dispute. There, the builder was made to consume alcohol and was photographed in objectionable positions with Janvi.These images were later used to extort Rs 2 crore from him.The complaint also states that Kirti and Savani had earlier defamed the builder on social media and issued threats related to the pending property matter.The offence was registered in June last year, but Patel had remained untraceable until now.This isn’t the first time Kirti Patel has run afoul of the law.At least 10 FIRs have been filed against her across police stations in Gujarat, including for attempted murder (2020, Puna police), extortion (Vastrapur police), and criminal intimidation. She also faces cases in Gandhinagar, Patan, Junagadh, and Surat rural police limits — ranging from assault to prohibition offences.Police say she built an image of notoriety on social media, often uploading abusive videos and issuing open threats to rivals. Investigators say her public persona was part of a deliberate strategy to exert dominance over targets and intimidate complainants.After evading arrest for more than a year, Kirti Patel will now be produced in court for remand.Police are also probing the role of others involved in the blackmail racket and whether similar honey-trap tactics were used with other victims.","Kirti Patel, also known as Kirti Adalja, has been arrested after a year-long evasion.

Greece's parliament voted Thursday to investigate a former transport minister over the country's worst rail tragedy that left 57 dead in 2023.Government lawmakers approved the probe into the actions of Kostas Karamanlis, who has welcomed the investigation as an opportunity to clear his name.Fifty-seven people, most of them young students, were killed in February 2023 when a passenger train and a freight train collided in Tempe, central Greece, having been allowed to run on the same track for 12 minutes.The tragedy sparked sweeping strikes and hundreds of protests in Greece and abroad.Karamanlis, a member of one of Greece's most influential political families, told lawmakers that he would ""never forget"" the night of the accident.He insisted he had done ""everything"" in his power to improve the state of Greek railways.""I did not neglect, I did not ignore the railways, quite the opposite,"" Karamanlis said during the debate that began Wednesday.""I too want justice... I fully support the proposal"" to set up a special inquiry committee, he added.A parliamentary committee will now examine whether Karamanlis should be referred to justice for breach of duty, a misdemeanour-level offence.Opposition parties, who had sought criminal charges for Karamanlis, accused the conservative government of seeking to ""launder"" its responsibilities by backing a probe into a lesser charge.Some parties had sought to implicate Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis himself.Taking the floor on Wednesday, Mitsotakis dismissed as ""disgraceful"" a proposal by leftist and far-right parties to have him investigated for high treason.Over 40 people have been prosecuted over the collision, including the station master responsible for routing the trains that night.Lawmakers already voted to refer a former junior minister, Christos Triantopoulos, to justice on possible misdemeanour charges for breach of duty in connection with the aftermath of the accident.Opposition parties say Triantopoulos, who was dispatched by the prime minister to the scene after the accident, authorised the bulldozing of the crash site, which led to the loss of vital evidence.Triantopoulos denies wrongdoing.Greece's intercity trains came under private management in 2017, when state-owned Greek rail operator TrainOSE was privatised and sold to Italy's Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane, becoming Hellenic Train.In April, a bomb exploded outside Hellenic Train's offices, without causing any injuries.","Greece's parliament votes to investigate a former transport minister over the country's worst rail tragedy.

MAGA camp divided on war stance

Military options on the table





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday revealed that right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson had phoned him to apologise.The apology came after the former Fox News host admitted his remarks about the conflict between Israel and Iran were “a little bit too strong.”Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump called Carlson a “nice guy” and said he appreciated the apology. “Tucker’s a nice guy,” the President told reporters. “He called and apologised the other day because he thought he said things that were a little bit too strong and I appreciated that.”Trump also said the two discussed Iran’s nuclear ambitions, which have become a key concern as the war in the Middle East deepens. “I did ask Tucker, I said, ‘Well, are you OK with nuclear weapons being in the hands of Iran?’” Trump said. “And he sort of didn’t like that. And I said, ‘Well, if it’s OK with you, then you and I do have a difference.’ But it’s really not OK with him. Therefore, you may have to fight.”His remarks come amid growing tensions in the Middle East, where Israel’s strikes have reportedly killed over 24 people in Iran and wounded more than 500 in Israel. The attacks have also targeted nuclear scientists and military officials. Iran has since retaliated, while its Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has vowed not to surrender, warning that any US involvement would cause “irreparable damage”.The Israel-Iran conflict has sparked an internal split among Trump’s MAGA supporters. While figures like Carlson, Steve Bannon and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene oppose US involvement, others such as Fox News’ Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, and Senators Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz have voiced support for Israel’s actions.Trump’s own stance appears mixed. While he has demanded Iran’s “unconditional surrender,” he told reporters Wednesday, “Maybe we won’t have to fight. I’m not looking to fight. But if it’s a choice between fighting and them having a nuclear weapon, you have to do what you have to do.”Trump met his national security team in the White House Situation Room to discuss further steps. The US has reportedly considered supplying Israel with bunker-busting bombs to target Iran’s underground nuclear facility at Fordow. Meanwhile, the State Department has begun evacuating nonessential staff from the embassy in Jerusalem and is offering exit options for American citizens in Israel.","Right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson apologises for remarks about Israel and Iran.

With players, including US internationals Weston McKennie and Timothy Weah, standing behind him, Trump shifted from general remarks to controversial territory—transgender participation in women’s sports.Turning to the team, Trump asked, “Could a woman make your team, fellas?” The players stayed quiet, exchanging awkward glances.He repeated the question, this time directing it at Juventus General Manager Damien Comolli. Trying to steer clear of controversy, Comolli replied, “We have a very good women’s team,” referring to Juventus Women, the reigning Serie A champions.Trump pressed again: “But they should be playing with women?” Comolli did not respond. “See, they’re very diplomatic,” Trump quipped.The incident comes hours after the US Supreme Court allowed Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors to stand—a ruling seen as a major blow to transgender rights. Trump has made restricting transgender participation in women’s sports a key focus of his second-term agenda.In February, he signed an executive order titled “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports,” which has triggered policy changes at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and lawsuits in several states.","Juventus football players and staff visited the White House on Wednesday.

The HC during the hearing had repeatedly asked why Hasan was so reluctant to apologize or express regret when public sentiment is hurt.In contrast, the SC bench of Justices Bhuyan and Manmohan on Tuesday had observed that “The HC had no business to seek regret or apology. As a custodian of rule of law and protector of rights, it should have considered the issue of whether a CBFC cleared film be allowed to be released in theatres of the state… Public sentiment does not mean a gun is put to the head of the theatre owners to stop screening of the film.”On the threat of violence issued by a vigilante group, the bench had said, “The Rule of Law demands that the film be released in the theatres of Karnataka. As democratic state, Karnataka cannot allow mobs to jeopardise the rule of law. The state must ensure that the rule of law prevails”In its affidavit, the Siddaramaiah govt told the SC that it is “the duty and responsibility of the state govt to uphold the fundamental rights of its citizens and in maintaining the ‘Rule of Law’ in the state, and the state govt and its instrumentalities are committed in discharging such duties and protecting the fundamental rights of its citizens, including the fundamental rights of the stakeholders involved in the present issue. ”",Karnataka govt told the Supreme Court that if the film ‘Thug Life’ is released in the state theatres it will take every step to maintain law and order. Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC) had written a letter to Hasan on May 30 expressing its displeasure at certain statements made by him at a promotional event.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121943392,imgsize-1300032,width-400,resizemode-4/121943392.jpg"

Crime scene reconstruction: A chilling timeline

The first blow came from Vishal Chauhan, followed by Akash Rajput, and then Anand Kurmi — Sonam’s co-conspirators, handpicked by Kushwaha.





Sonam stood in front of Raja during the attack. When his blood splattered on her white shirt, she fled.





Raja’s body was later tossed into a gorge — two men held his arms, one grabbed his legs.





A second weapon













NEW DELHI: In the twisted saga of businessman Raja Raghuvanshi’s murder during his honeymoon in Meghalaya, investigators are now chasing a new name, ' Sanjay Verma '.Call records show that Sonam Raghuvanshi, the prime accused and Raja’s wife, had long and repeated phone conversations with a number registered under this name.But police say Sanjay Verma may not exist, at least not in the way records suggest.The number, police suspect, was being actively used by Raj Kushwaha, Sonam’s alleged lover and co-accused, a Class 12 dropout who worked as an accountant in her family’s sunmica business in Indore.The number clocked over 200 calls in March and April, with frequent early morning, evening and late-night long conversations.The number was last seen active on WhatsApp at 11.30pm on June 8, around the same time when Kushwaha and others were being picked up by police from multiple locations.With this new line of investigation, police are no longer seeing the case as just a tale of a love triangle. ""We are exploring whether someone stood to gain from Raja's death,"" said East Khasi Hills SP Vivek Syiem.""Preliminary investigation pointed to a love triangle, but we are examining whether there were other motives, including financial gain, as Raja had recently bagged a contract,"" he added.Police recently recreated the final moments of Raja’s life at the Riat Arliang parking lot, near Meghalaya’s Weisawdong Falls, where he was lured and attacked. A fireman stood in for Raja as the accused replayed the crime. According to investigators:Police confirmed that Sonam did not help dispose of the body, but she did damage his phone, and the others later destroyed it completely.During the crime scene reenactment, the accused also revealed the location of a second murder weapon — a machete with a steel handle, bought from Guwahati.A special SDRF team recovered it from the gorge after a lengthy search. The white shirt found at the scene was identified as belonging to Akash.A tourist captured a short video of Raja and Sonam trekking near the Double Decker Bridge — possibly the last footage of him alive. “We have the clip. It establishes they were together before the murder. We will call the tourist for a statement,” said SP Syiem.A Meghalaya police team visited the homes of both Sonam and Raj Kushwaha in Indore this week, questioning relatives and staff at the family business. Sonam’s brother, Govind Raghuvanshi, accompanied the police during their visit. While he denied knowing about any ‘Sanjay Verma’, he said he was “ready for any test” if needed.Kushwaha’s mother, Chunni Devi, was also questioned at their modest home. She told police she had no knowledge of her son’s involvement in the case.","Raja Raghuvanshi was lured and murdered during his honeymoon in Meghalaya.

Exiled Iranian royal Reza Pahlavi, son of the last Shah of Iran, issued a dramatic call to action on Tuesday, urging Iran’s military, police, and state employees to join a nationwide uprising against the Khamenei-led Islamic Republic, declaring that its ""fall has begun. ""In a sweeping address to the Iranian people, Pahlavi wrote on X, ""The Islamic Republic has reached its end and is in the process of collapsing. Khamenei, like a frightened rat, has gone into hiding underground and has lost control of the situation. What has begun is irreversible.""He expressed solidarity with those affected by the country’s turmoil and reiterated his long-standing opposition to war. ""In these difficult days, my heart is with all the defenceless citizens who have been harmed and have fallen victim to Khamenei's warmongering and delusions.""Calling the current moment a “sharp turn in history,” Pahlavi asserted, ""The regime’s apparatus of repression is falling apart. All it takes now is a nationwide uprising to put an end to this nightmare once and for all.""Encouraging people across Iranian cities—from Bandar Abbas to Mashhad—to take to the streets, he sought to calm fears of chaos post-regime: ""Do not fear the day after the fall of the Islamic Republic.Iran will not descend into civil war or instability.""He said preparations were already in place: ""We have a plan for Iran’s future and its flourishing. We are prepared for the first hundred days after the fall, for the transitional period, and for the establishment of a national and democratic government—by the Iranian people and for the Iranian people.""To members of Iran’s state apparatus, Pahlavi appealed directly: ""Do not stand against the Iranian people for the sake of a regime whose fall has begun and is inevitable. By standing with the people, you can save your lives.""His call came a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced strong support for regime change in Iran during an interview with the opposition-linked Iran International news outlet, saying, ""The regime’s days are numbered… I know that Iran can be great again. It was a great civilization, and this theological thuggery that has kidnapped your country will not stand for long, and you are the future, not them. ""Netanyahu added: ""A light has been lit—carry it to freedom. Your hour of freedom is near; it’s happening now.""Highlighting what he described as widespread dissent, Netanyahu said, ""These dictators in Iran, sure they fear us—but they fear you, the people of Iran, even more. They understand that 80 percent of Iranians despise them.""In a separate interview with Fox News, the Israeli leader indicated that ongoing pressure on Tehran could lead to a change in regime: ""Regime change could certainly be the result.""Citing ancient ties between the Iranian and Jewish people, Netanyahu said, ""The Persian people and the Jewish people have had an ancient friendship that goes back to the times of Cyrus the Great; that could happen again."" He emphasised, however, that the final decision rests with Iranians: ""The decision to act, to rise up, at this time is the decision of the Iranian people.""Israeli PM also confirmed that Israel’s recent strikes, dubbed ""Operation Rising Lion"", were launched based on intelligence that Tehran had stockpiled enough enriched uranium to build nine nuclear bombs.","Exiled Iranian royal Reza Pahlavi, son of the last Shah of Iran, issued a dramatic call to action on Tuesday.

US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was taken to a hospital in Washington, DC, on Tuesday after suffering an allergic reaction, according to officials from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).The 53-year-old cabinet member was transported by ambulance out of precaution and is now alert and recovering, a DHS spokesperson confirmed. “Secretary Noem had an allergic reaction today. She was transported to the hospital out of an abundance of caution. She is alert and recovering,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.Noem was admitted to the emergency room, where CNN reporters observed several Secret Service agents positioned at multiple entrances.Appointed to lead the department shortly after Donald Trump secured a second presidential term, Noem was confirmed by the Senate in late January. Her appointment followed a career as South Dakota’s governor and representative in Congress.Since taking over the DHS, she has become a key figure in enforcing Trump’s renewed focus on strict immigration controls. Under her leadership, the department has overseen troop deployments to the southern border and the use of emergency powers to facilitate mass deportations of undocumented migrants.In addition to overseeing immigration enforcement, Noem also manages the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), though she has recently called for the agency to be dismantled. She has repeatedly criticised FEMA as ineffective and unnecessary. Last week, Trump also stated his intention to phase out FEMA following the end of this year’s hurricane season.As news of her hospitalisation spread, messages of support poured in online.Bruce LeVell, former Executive Director of President Trump’s National Diversity Coalition, posted on X, “My dear friend @Sec_Noem, our fearless Secretary of Homeland Security, was just rushed to the hospital. My heart is with her during this challenging time, but I know her strength and determination will shine through. Please join me in keeping Kristi in your prayers for a swift and full recovery.“She has been tirelessly spearheading @realDonaldTrump initiative to uphold law and order and utilise ICE to keep our country safe from criminals.

O'Keefe was beaten and then left outside the home, not hit by car







After deliberating since June 13, the jury Wednesday pronounced the verdict in the Karen Read case and found her not guilty of second-degree murder in the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend John O'Keefe but guilty of a lesser charge of drunken driving. Read's lawyers have been claiming for long that she was framed by the police after she dropped O'Keefe off at a party at the resident of a fellow officer. Prosecutors argued the 45-year-old Read hit O’Keefe, 46, with her SUV before driving away, but the defense maintained O’Keefe was killed inside the home and later dragged outside.The incident took place in January 2022. It became one of the most highly watched cases.Read faced charges of second-degree murder, manslaughter and leaving the scene outside Boston. A second-degree murder conviction would have carried a life sentence.Read's first trial ended in a mistrial in July 2024 after the jury could not reach a verdict.Read’s defense said O’Keefe was beaten, bitten by a dog, then left outside a home in the Boston suburb of Canton in a conspiracy orchestrated by the police that included planting evidence.Prosecutors have described Read as a scorned lover who chose to leave O’Keefe dying in the snow after striking him with her SUV outside the house party. The state’s case was led by special prosecutor Hank Brennan, who called fewer witnesses than prosecutor Adam Lally, who ran the first trial against Read.Describing O’Keefe as a “good man” who “helped people,” Brennan told jurors during closing arguments that O’Keefe needed help that night and the only person who could provide it was Read. Instead, she drove away in her SUV. “She was drunk. She hit him and she left him to die,” he said.Defense attorney Alan Jackson rejected the idea that there was ever a collision at all. He and the defense called forward expert witnesses who agreed. “There is no evidence that John was hit by a car. None. This case should be over right now, done, because there was no collision,” Jackson said during closing arguments.","Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder in the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend John O'Keefe.

As the conflict between Israel and Iran entered its seventh day, both countries continued to launch strikes against each other on Thursday.The Israeli military said early Thursday that it was carrying out a ""series of strikes"" in Tehran and other parts of Iran. The Israeli Air Force confirmed on X that it had begun ""a wave of attacks in Tehran and other areas,"" but did not share details about the targets. These strikes came after Israel said it had intercepted a drone launched from Iran in the early hours of Thursday.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he was still deciding whether the United States would take part in Israel’s military action. He said Iran had contacted the US to discuss possible talks at the White House, but may have waited too long.Israel's military also issued a warning for people to leave the area around Iran’s Arak heavy water reactor. The warning, posted on social media platform X, included a satellite image of the plant marked with a red circle, similar to other warnings that have come before earlier strikes.The Arak reactor is located about 250 kilometers southwest of Tehran. Heavy water is used to cool reactors and can create plutonium, which may be used in nuclear weapons if a country chooses that path instead of using enriched uranium.While Israel confirmed it was continuing strikes around Tehran and other parts of Iran, it has not provided immediate details about the intended targets.Senior US officials are preparing for the possibility of a strike on Iran in the coming days, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing sources familiar with the matter.The Bloomberg report said the situation remains fluid and could change. Some of the sources mentioned that a strike might take place over the weekend.Amid the ongoing conflict between the two regional powers in the Middle East, a flight carrying 110 Indian nationals evacuated from Iran landed in Delhi as part of Operation Sindhu.Earlier, as tensions escalated, Indian students in Tehran were moved out of the city. Through arrangements made by the Indian embassy on Tuesday, 110 of them crossed the border into Armenia under the same operation.At least 639 people have been killed and 1,329 injured in Israeli strikes across Iran, according to a report released Thursday by the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists.The group said it had verified the deaths of 263 civilians and 154 members of the security forces. The figures cover the entire country.Human Rights Activists, which previously tracked casualties during the 2022 protests following Mahsa Amini’s death, said it cross-checks local Iranian reports with information from a network of sources inside the country.Iran has not been providing regular updates on casualties during the conflict. Its last report, released on Monday, stated that 224 people had been killed and 1,277 wounded.US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he was still deciding whether the United States would take part in Israel’s military action. He also said Iran had reached out to start talks.""I may do it, I may not do it,"" Trump told reporters. ""I can tell you this, that Iran's got a lot of trouble, and they want to negotiate.""Trump said Iran had even suggested sending officials to the White House to talk about its nuclear program in an attempt to stop the Israeli strikes.When asked if it was too late for talks, Trump responded: ""Nothing is too late.""In a televised statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Trump a ""great friend"" and thanked him ""for the support of the United States in defending Israel's skies"".Iran has not requested military assistance from Russia during its ongoing air conflict with Israel, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday.""Our Iranian friends have not asked us about this,"" Putin was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP.Russian President on Wednesday also offered to help mediate an end to the conflict. He suggested that Moscow could assist in negotiating a settlement that would allow Iran to maintain a peaceful nuclear program while addressing Israel’s security concerns.Speaking to reporters from international news agencies, Putin said, ""It's a delicate issue,"" but added, ""in my view, a solution could be found,"" news agency AP reported.When asked how Russia would respond if Israel were to kill Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Putin declined to answer. ""I don't even want to discuss such a possibility,"" he said.Putin also said that Russia had shared its proposals with Iran, Israel, and the United States.""We are not imposing anything on anyone; we are simply talking about how we see a possible way out of the situation. But the decision, of course, is up to the political leadership of all these countries, primarily Iran and Israel,"" he said.Moreover, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday in a speech broadcast on state TV: ""This nation will never surrender.""He added: ""America should know that any military intervention will undoubtedly result in irreparable damage.""Earlier, Trump had said that the United States knows Khamenei's location but would not act against him ""for now"".Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said on Thursday that Iran remained committed to “diplomacy” but was acting in “self-defence” in response to Israel’s actions.","Israel confirms continuing strikes around Tehran and other parts of Iran.

Tensions between Iran and Israel continued as the conflict entered its seventh day with airstrikes, missile fire, and growing international concern. Israel says it has targeted key nuclear-related sites in Tehran, while Iran has launched a limited missile response. Here are the latest developments in the conflict:Trump again refused to say whether he would order a strike on Iran. “I have a plan for everything… anything could happen,” he said.He added that his decisions were not yet final and that “things change—especially with war.”The US president further said he may meet Iranian officials but claimed it was ""too late"" for talks. ""They should have taken the deal. We spoke for 60 days. Now they wish they had,"" he said.Trump held a Situation Room meeting on Thursday to discuss the conflict, which lasted about an hour. Officials didn’t confirm who attended or what decisions were made.Senior diplomats from Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the European Union will hold nuclear talks with Iranian officials on Friday in Switzerland. The meeting comes at a tense moment, with US President Donald Trump still undecided on whether to authorise American military support for Israeli strikes targeting Iran’s nuclear programme, an official told AP.Explosions echoed across Tehran on Wednesday as Israel launched three waves of airstrikes on the Iranian capital. Less than a week into the conflict, Israeli forces now claim they have full control of the skies over Tehran.Footage from Tehran also showed smoke rising from areas near a police building and a Red Crescent facility.According to the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists, at least 639 people have been killed and 1,329 injured in the Israeli strikes across Iran. The group reported that among the dead are 263 civilians and 154 members of Iran’s security forces.Iran fired a small number of missiles at Israel, according to the IDF. No casualties or damage were reported.Air defences intercepted the missiles, and sirens were heard in central Israel, including Jerusalem, it said.India’s Operation Sindhu began with an evacuation flight carrying 110 Indian citizens from Yerevan, Armenia, landing safely in New Delhi.The Ministry of External Affairs earlier confirmed that Indian students in Tehran had been moved to safety with help from the Indian Embassy.Iran is facing a near-total internet blackout, according to NetBlocks. The communication ministry blamed Israel for “abusing the network,” while Iranian media reported that Israeli hackers briefly hijacked state TV, airing protest footage.Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran remains committed to diplomacy but reserves the right to defend itself.""Iran only retaliated against the Israeli regime. We haven’t targeted those supporting it,” he wrote on X.He called Israel “illegitimate” and repeated Iran’s stance of “self-defence, not aggression.”Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Moscow could help negotiate a peaceful settlement between Israel and Iran. Speaking to global media heads, Putin said Russia had shared proposals with Tehran, Tel Aviv and Washington.“We are not imposing anything,” he said. “We are only showing how we see a way out.

A war of attrition and estimation

Cracks in Iran's defense and production

Running on empty—or playing possum?





The battle between Iran and Israel has escalated into one of the Middle East's most defining confrontations in decades, and the fate of the conflict may hinge on a deceptively simple number: how many medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) Iran has left.According to Israeli military data and independent expert estimates, Iran has fired around 700 MRBMs at Israel over the past 14 months, including more than 380 in just the last six days. That leaves Tehran's remaining stockpile somewhere between 300 and 1,300 missiles, depending on who you ask—a wide range that underscores just how murky and consequential the numbers game has become.The Iranian arsenal has been battered not only by its own usage but also by Israel's relentless six-day aerial assault. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) claim to have taken out at least a third of Iran's MRBM launchers, directly impacting Tehran's ability to sustain long-range attacks.""If these launch estimates hold, Iran's deterrence capabilities are hanging by a thread,"" CNN quoted Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the foundation for the defense of democracies. He warns that Iran's missile stockpile may soon drop ""below four digits""—a psychological and strategic red line for the Islamic Republic.Taleblu noted that Iran's missile strategy relies heavily on overwhelming quantity rather than cutting-edge technology. ""For the Islamic Republic, quantity has a quality of its own,"" he said. ""Losing that quantity threatens their entire warfighting doctrine.""Damage to Iran's infrastructure may be even more severe than previously acknowledged. UK chief of the defence staff admiral Tony Radakin revealed in December that 100 Israeli aircraft launched a devastating barrage that nearly wiped out Iran's air defense network and its ballistic missile production capabilities—for a full year.Israeli intelligence further claims that strikes earlier this year destroyed key facilities responsible for missile motor production, severely disrupting Iran's supply chain. However, experts caution that foreign support, especially from China, could help Iran recover and rebuild its production lines faster than expected.Despite this, conflicting narratives persist. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently claimed Iran could ramp up production to 300 missiles a month, theoretically reaching 20,000 missiles in six years. But he offered no concrete evidence for the claim, prompting skepticism from analysts.Iran has so far refused to disclose its actual missile count. But according to Dr Eyal Pinko, a former Israeli naval intelligence officer and current fellow at the Begin-Sadat Center, the current estimate ranges between 700 and 800 MRBMs left, factoring in recent launches and confirmed losses.For Tehran, this situation is precarious. Iran is not known for conventional warfighting prowess, and it historically leans on its missile arsenal as both deterrent and diplomatic leverage. If its MRBM supply dips too low, Iran could be forced into negotiations from a position of weakness—or escalate the conflict in desperation.As Israeli airpower continues to pound Iranian positions, the war appears to be shifting from a contest of ideologies to one of inventory. In this war of missiles, every launch narrows Tehran’s strategic options—and may ultimately determine whether the conflict burns out or blows up.","The fate of the conflict may hinge on how many medium-range ballistic missiles Iran has left. Iran has fired around 700 MRBMs at Israel over the past 14 months, including more than 380 in just the last six days.

As Israeli warplanes continue to hammer Iranian targets, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has emerged politically reinvigorated, both domestically and on the world stage.Just days before Israel’s offensive began, Netanyahu’s coalition government was teetering on collapse over internal tensions, particularly over plans to conscript ultra-Orthodox Jews. Facing mounting criticism for his handling of the prolonged Gaza war and a hostage crisis dating back to Hamas’s October 2023 attack, Netanyahu’s leadership seemed on the brink.Now, with the war against Iran reshaping Israel’s political mood, Netanyahu’s approval ratings are rebounding. A new poll published by a conservative Israeli broadcaster shows 54% of respondents support the prime minister, up significantly from earlier weeks.“Netanyahu is greatly strengthened,” said Yonatan Freeman, a geopolitics expert at Hebrew University. “There’s broad public support for his argument that striking Iran preemptively was necessary.”Even opposition leader Yair Lapid backed the decision, calling the strike “the right one” in a Jerusalem Post op-ed.For Netanyahu, who has long warned of Iran’s nuclear ambitions, this war appears to be a defining moment.“Israel is fighting for its survival and has a chance to reshape the Middle East,” he said before the strikes began.The Israeli leader’s international standing, badly damaged by the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and an ICC arrest warrant for alleged war crimes, has seen a shift. Since the Iran offensive began, European leaders have rallied behind him. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz even said Israel was doing “the dirty work… for all of us.”Yet analysts warn the support may be fleeting. “If the war drags on, public sentiment could turn again,” said Denis Charbit of Israel’s Open University. “Netanyahu is asserting his Churchillian image, but the final act is still unwritten.”","Netanyahu's approval ratings are rebounding.

Advice from Travel Agents: Act Early, Stay Informed

Check flight updates regularly, as schedules are subject to sudden change





Remain in close contact with embassies and consulates for the latest travel advisories





Use licensed agents or official platforms for visa extensions or re-entry permits to avoid any legal issues





As political instability escalates in parts of the Middle East, the UAE is witnessing a growing wave of travel changes, with visitors and residents alike choosing to stay longer or cancel upcoming trips. Travel agencies in the country are fielding a sharp increase in calls from individuals, particularly from Jordan, Lebanon, and Iran, seeking solutions to remain in the UAE amid safety concerns and disrupted flight operations.Travel agents across the UAE have reported a noticeable surge in inquiries from tourists who had entered the country on short-term visit visas but now wish to remain longer than originally planned. The key reasons include airspace closures, flight cancellations, and widespread concerns about returning to areas affected by ongoing conflict.Speaking to a local news outlet,Bharath Aidasani, managing partner at Pluto Travels, confirme that many of these visitors are actively seeking legal avenues to extend their stay.“Flights to some of these countries are being cancelled or delayed,” he said.“We are getting many calls from visitors who are worried about returning and want to extend their visas or exit and re-enter legally.”He noted that Jordanian, Lebanese, and other Middle Eastern nationals are among the most frequent callers, and that inquiries are coming in daily.“Some visitors are scrambling to find a solution,” Aidasani explained. “They are either trying to extend their visas or making plans to exit and re-enter the UAE on a fresh visa.”For many, the UAE is now seen as a safe haven compared to the unpredictability back home. Aidasani emphasized that this perception of the Emirates as a secure place is a major factor in their decision.“The UAE continues to be seen as a safe place in the region, and many people feel more secure staying here until the situation improves,” he said.The shift in travel patterns is not limited to tourists. UAE residents, especially expatriates originally from regions experiencing tensions, are also opting to delay or cancel summer holiday plans.Subair Thekepurathvalappil, senior manager at Wisefox Tourism, toldthat many of their clients, including long-term residents, have decided against traveling this summer.“People who had planned to travel for the summer are now staying back,” he said. “They are concerned about the ongoing conflict and airspace closures. Many don’t want to take the risk of traveling right now.”He noted that some residents were hesitant not only due to the conflicts themselves, but also due to unpredictability in flight schedules and the risk of being stranded or delayed.In recent weeks, multiple flights connecting the UAE with countries such as Lebanon, Jordan, and Iran have been cancelled or rescheduled, primarily due to airspace restrictions linked to ongoing regional tensions. The geopolitical strain, particularly involving Iran and Israel, has led to closures of key flight corridors.As a result, passengers on connecting flights that pass through the affected region are also facing indirect disruptions, including missed connections and longer flight durations caused by re-routing.These delays have created further uncertainty for travelers, who are now increasingly cautious and opting to reconsider their immediate travel plans.With the situation remaining fluid, travel experts are urging visitors not to wait until the last minute when it comes to visa extensions or travel decisions. Being proactive can help avoid penalties or complications.Subair Thekepurathvalappil, senior manager at Wisefox Tourism, advised short-term visitors to take timely action if they're uncertain about their travel plans.“If you’re on a visit visa and unsure of your travel plans, it’s better to extend it in advance,” he said. “Delaying could mean paying fines or even overstaying by accident. Act early and speak to your travel agent or apply through official channels.”He also recommended that both visitors and residents take the following precautions:","Travel agents across the UAE have reported a noticeable surge in inquiries from tourists who had entered the country on short-term visit visas but now wish to remain longer.

Gulf waters under watch: Qatar warns of potential regional impact



Nuclear and energy sites struck as conflict enters fifth day



Qatar condemns strikes on energy infrastructure







Amid heightened conflict between Israel and Iran, Qatar has stepped up monitoring of radiation levels in the Gulf, following Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and energy sites. On Tuesday, Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari confirmed that Doha is closely tracking environmental developments in the region, while calling for international awareness of the potential fallout from strikes on sensitive facilities.“We are monitoring this on a daily basis,” al-Ansari said during a news conference.“We have nothing to be concerned about right now, but obviously prolonged escalation will have unpredictable consequences.”Al-Ansari stressed the strategic and environmental importance of the Gulf’s waters, describing them as the region’s primary water source. He warned that any military action targeting nuclear or energy-related facilities could result in outcomes beyond current prediction.“We have to emphasise, when we are talking about the waters of the Gulf, it’s the main source of water for all of us here in the region,” he said.“The international community has to make it very clear that any targeting of nuclear facilities, any targeting of fuel or energy facilities in this region, would have ramifications that are unknown to us in the Gulf.”The current escalation began Friday when Israel launched a major air campaign against Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. This marked the start of a now five-day-long exchange of missile strikes between the two countries.Iran’s key nuclear enrichment facilities, which were among the Israeli targets, are located deep inland. However, Iran also operates a nuclear power plant at Bushehr, situated along the Gulf coast.According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran informed the UN nuclear watchdog that the Bushehr plant had not been targeted. The statement was issued by the IAEA on Friday.On Saturday, Israel targeted a significant Iranian gas installation on the Gulf coast. The facility supports the South Pars gas field, a major energy project shared between Iran and Qatar.While confirming that Qatar’s part of the shared gas field remains unaffected, the Qatari government expressed concern over the risks such attacks pose to regional stability.“Qatar's own facilities in the field are secure,” said al-Ansari.Nonetheless, he strongly criticised the Israeli strikes on Iran’s energy assets.He described the actions as “reckless,” adding to Qatar’s calls for de-escalation and urging international stakeholders to prevent further destabilisation in the Gulf.","Qatar has stepped up monitoring of radiation levels in the Gulf, following Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and energy sites.

US Vice-President JD Vance on Tuesday warned that Donald Trump might take ""further action"" in a bid to end Iran's nuclear programme hours after the US president strongly advocated against Tehran possessing any nuclear weapon.""The president has shown remarkable restraint in keeping our military's focus on protecting our troops and protecting our citizens. He may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment,"" Vance said in a post X.Clearing the air over US's stance regarding Iran possessing nukes, Vance said, ""First, POTUS has been amazingly consistent, over 10 years, that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. Over the last few months, he encouraged his foreign policy team to reach a deal with the Iranians to accomplish this goal. The president has made clear that Iran cannot have uranium enrichment. And he said repeatedly that this would happen one of two ways--the easy way or the 'other' way. """"Second, I've seen a lot of confusion over the issue of ""civilian nuclear power"" and ""uranium enrichment."" These are distinct issues. Iran could have civilian nuclear power without enrichment, but Iran rejected that. Meanwhile, they've enriched uranium far above the level necessary for any civilian purpose.They've been found in violation of their non-proliferation obligations by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is hardly a rightwing organization,"" he added.Earlier in the day, Trump had made it clear that Iran ""cannot have nuclear weapons"" saying, ""Iran should have signed the “deal” I told them to sign. What a shame, and waste of human life. Simply stated, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. I said it over and over again! Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!""Israel's recent military operation targeted Iran’s key nuclear facilities at Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan, according to the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). A major above-ground section of Natanz, including its power infrastructure, was destroyed, and satellite imagery suggests potential damage to its underground enrichment plant.While no visible damage was found at the deeply buried Fordow enrichment site, the IAEA confirmed that four buildings at the Isfahan facility were hit — including a chemical lab, uranium conversion plant, reactor fuel plant, and a metal processing unit under construction.","US Vice-President JD Vance warned that Donald Trump might take ""further action"" in a bid to end Iran's nuclear programme.

A Sharjah court has convicted two school staff members of negligence in the death of eight-year-old Indian student Rashid Habib, more than a year after he tragically died following a fall at his school in Muwaileh.The Sharjah Federal Court of Appeal overturned an earlier acquittal by a lower court and ordered the defendants to pay Dh200,000 in legal blood money to the boy’s family. Additionally, each staff member was fined Dh2,000.The court found that the two staffers had failed in their duty to escort and monitor students from the school bus to their classrooms. CCTV footage reviewed during the investigation showed that Rashid was left unaccompanied at the time of the incident.The Grade 1 student collapsed while walking alone to his classroom on 11 March 2024, the first day of Ramadan, shortly after arriving at the CBSE-curriculum school.He was rushed to Al Qassimi Hospital in a state of cardiac arrest but was declared dead despite resuscitation attempts.A forensic report from Sharjah Police stated that Rashid had sustained a bruise on his face, a fractured cheekbone, internal bleeding under the scalp, and severe brain injuries, including swelling and bleeding.Surveillance footage confirmed that no school staff were present with the children during the incident. The footage also showed that another child had attempted to hit Rashid moments before he fell. However, the crucial seconds capturing the exact moment of the fall were missing.The appeal court ruled that the staff’s absence amounted to gross negligence, emphasising that the accident could likely have been prevented had the staff been present.Rashid’s father, Habib Yasar, told Khaleej Times: “Not a day goes by when we don’t remember Rashid. Our lives have never been the same. We keep thinking of what could have been if someone had just been there to watch over him. Why was there no CCTV camera? A school is supposed to be like a second home, but it didn’t take care of my child. This conviction brings some closure, but the pain remains. We lost a part of ourselves that day. ”The family had previously claimed Rashid was bullied and attacked during the missing seconds, a charge the school denied.Due to ongoing legal and administrative proceedings, the name of the school involved is being withheld.",Rashid Habib collapsed while walking alone to his classroom on 11 March 2024.

How difficult is it to target Fordow?







With tensions escalating between Israel and Iran, the focus has shifted to one of the most heavily guarded sites in the Islamic Republic: the Fordow nuclear facility, buried deep within a mountain.Designed specifically to survive conventional attacks, Fordow represents a critical node in Iran’s nuclear program — and destroying it is central to any serious effort to cripple Tehran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons.But there’s a catch- only the United States possesses a weapon capable of penetrating that mountain.And with the US President Donald Trump repeatedly claiming the Iran ""should not have a nuclear weapon"", that too in all caps on Truth Social, Israel and the States seem to be on the same page.Known officially as the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), this 30,000-pound bomb is a feat of engineering tailored for one purpose — to annihilate deeply buried and fortified targets. Commonly called a “bunker-buster,” it was developed after intelligence revealed adversaries like Iran and North Korea were moving critical infrastructure, including nuclear programs, underground to avoid airstrikes.Israel has long expressed concern about Iran’s nuclear ambitions, particularly after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported in 2023 that uranium at Fordow had been enriched to 83.7% purity — just below the 90% threshold needed for a nuclear weapon.Also Read: Why Israel needs Donald Trump to take out Iran's nukes - Explained But while Israel has advanced fighter jets and intelligence capabilities, it lacks both the MOP and the aircraft needed to deliver it. The US has historically declined to provide this bomb to Israel, fearing it could trigger a broader regional war.""We've had a policy for a long time of not providing those to the Israelis because we didn't want them to use them,"" said General Joseph Votel, commander of US Central Command during Trump's first term.Instead, the US has used its possession of the MOP as a deterrent, signaling to Iran that its underground facilities are still vulnerable.Without access to the MOP, Israel has developed contingency plans to cripple Fordow indirectly:Fordow is Iran’s second nuclear enrichment site after its main facility at Natanz. To date, there’s no indication that Israeli strikes have damaged Natanz’s underground enrichment halls, nor have they targeted the tunnel networks Iran is constructing nearby.Smaller than Natanz, Fordow is embedded into a mountainside near the city of Qom, roughly 60 miles (95 kilometers) southwest of Tehran. Construction is believed to have begun in 2006, and the facility became operational in 2009—the same year Iran officially revealed its existence.Deeply fortified beneath approximately 80 meters (260 feet) of rock and earth, Fordow is also reportedly shielded by surface-to-air missile systems supplied by both Iran and Russia. However, those air defenses are believed to have already been compromised in recent Israeli airstrikes.Despite its formidable protection, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has emphasized that the mission to target Iran aims to dismantle its nuclear and missile programs, which he views as an existential threat. According to Israeli officials, Fordow remains a key objective in that broader strategy.","Israel has long expressed concern about Iran’s nuclear ambitions, particularly after the IAEA reported in 2023 that uranium at Fordow had been enriched to 83.7% purity — just below the 90% threshold needed for a nuclear weapon.

A Turkish court on Tuesday sentenced a far-right politician to more than two years in prison for inciting public hatred and hostility, but ordered his release because of time already served.Umit Ozdag, the leader of Turkey's Victory Party, was detained in January over accusations that he insulted President Recep Tayyip Erdogan with comments that he made during a party meeting.A day later, Ozdag was formally arrested and charged with inciting hatred against migrants. He was blamed for last year's anti-Syrian refugee riots in the central Turkish province of Kayseri, during which hundreds of homes and businesses were attacked.Ozdag, a 64-year-old former academic, is an outspoken critic of Turkey's refugee policies, and has previously called for the repatriation of millions of Syrian refugees.During his trial, Ozdag acknowledged advocating the return of refugees, but strongly denied that he had incited violence against them. He maintained that his imprisonment was politically motivated and aimed at silencing him.The court sentenced him to two years and four months in prison, but ordered his release, ruling that he has already served a sufficient portion of the sentence.The trial took place amid a widespread crackdown on the opposition to Erdogan's Justice and Development Party.Officials from municipalities controlled by the main opposition - the Republican People's Party, or CHP - have faced waves of arrests this year. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, viewed as the main challenger to Erdogan's two-decade rule, was detained in March over allegations of corruption.Many people in Turkey consider the cases to be politically driven, according to opinion polls.

Why the stakes are so high







As tensions between Iran and Israel escalate, a chilling question arises: Could this spiral into a nuclear crisis? In the past five days, the situation has worsened, with Israel reportedly targeting nuclear sites in Tehran. Experts warn that any further escalation could be catastrophic. At the heart of these rising tensions lies Iran’s most secretive and fortified nuclear facility, Fordow.Tucked deep beneath a mountain near Qom, the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant is one of Iran’s most secretive and heavily fortified nuclear sites. Its underground design—80 to 90 meters below the surface—makes it virtually impenetrable to aerial strikes, even with the most advanced bunker-buster bombs in Israel’s arsenal. Originally exposed in 2009 through Western intelligence, Fordow was built in secrecy and designed for survivability, especially in the face of potential military attacks on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure.What makes Fordow particularly alarming to global powers is its capacity to enrich uranium to levels close to weapons-grade. According to the IAEA, the site now houses 2,700 centrifuges and has been enriching uranium to 60%—a short technical step away from the 90% needed for nuclear weapons.According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), uranium enriched to 83.7% purity was found at the site in 2023, dangerously close to the 90% enrichment level needed for nuclear weapons.Experts warn that Iran could produce enough material for multiple bombs in just weeks if it chooses to weaponize its stockpile. Fordow’s strategic importance lies not only in its enrichment capabilities but in its symbolic and operational role as a hardened fallback facility, raising the stakes of any military or diplomatic attempt to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions.Despite repeated Israeli attempts to neutralize it, Fordow remains intact. Only the US possesses the kind of ordnance—like the GBU-57 bunker-buster—that might reach its buried core, and even that would likely require multiple strikes. For Iran, Fordow is a nuclear insurance policy. For the world, it is a red line—and possibly a countdown.""The Iranians fully understood that the Israelis would try to get inside their programs, and they built Fordo inside of a mountain a long time ago to take care of the post-Iraq problem,"" said Vali Nasr, an Iran expert who is a professor at Johns Hopkins University.Only one known weapon could potentially take out Fordow: the US-made 30,000-pound bomb. This bomb, also called ""bunker buster,"" is capable of burrowing through rock and steel before detonating.But there's a catch: Israel doesn't have it. The United States has consistently denied Israeli requests for the bomb, citing fears that its use could provoke a full-scale regional war.""We've had a policy for a long time of not providing those to the Israelis because we didn't want them to use them,"" said general Joseph Votel, former head of US central command.While Israel lacks the bunker buster or a heavy bomber to deliver it, it hasn't given up on options:""The Israelis have sprung a lot of clandestine operations lately,"" said general Kenneth McKenzie Jr, former commander of US central command. ""But the physics of the problem remain the same.""While the US has moved aircraft and refuelling tankers into the region, there's no indication yet that US President Donald Trump is prepared to shift long-standing US policy and provide Israel with the bomb. Officials warn that deploying it would involve complex coordination and risk significant collateral and geopolitical fallout.""If we use the bunker buster, there could be nuclear contamination,"" general Votel said. ""I think there would also certainly be fallout internationally over the idea that the United States joined Israel in what would be viewed as an illegal attack on the sovereignty of Iran,"" he added.Fordow is not just a physical challenge—it is a political one. An Israeli strike on the site, especially with US involvement, could trigger Iranian retaliation against American assets across the Middle East and plunge the region into another war.Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and remains a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). But with enrichment levels rising and regional threats mounting, international anxiety over Fordow continues to grow.Fordow symbolises the nuclear stalemate between Iran and its adversaries. For Israel, it represents the limits of its conventional reach. For the US, it is a geopolitical tripwire. And for Iran, it remains a testament to strategic foresight in the face of existential threats. As the Middle East teeters on the edge of a broader conflict, what happens—or does n't—at Fordow could shape the course of history.","Despite repeated Israeli attempts to neutralize it, Fordow remains intact. Fordow’s strategic importance lies not only in its enrichment capabilities but in its symbolic and operational role as a hardened fallback facility. Only the US possesses the kind of ordnance—like the GBU-57 bunker-buster that might reach the core, and even that would likely require multiple strikes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121909319,imgsize-1036760,width-400,resizemode-4/121909319.jpg"

51 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces and more than 200 were left wounded on Tuesday morning while waiting for UN and commercial aid trucks to enter the Gaza Strip territory, according to Gaza’s health ministry and a local hospital. The deaths occurred as residents gathered near the entry point of the trucks bringing much needed food into the territory.Witnesses told The Associated Press that Israeli forces opened fire on the crowd. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for a response.Yousef Nofal, an eyewitness, described seeing people motionless and bleeding on the ground after the Israeli forces opened fire. “It was a massacre,” he said, claiming that Israeli forces continued shooting as people attempted to flee. Another witness, Mohammed Abu Qeshfa, reported hearing a loud explosion followed by heavy gunfire and tank shelling. “I survived by a miracle,” he said.According to Palestinian accounts, Israeli forces have repeatedly fired on crowds trying to access food distribution points operated by the new aid network. Local health authorities say dozens have been killed and hundreds more injured in these incidents.The Israeli military has previously acknowledged firing warning shots in response to what it described as suspicious approaches to its forces.Israel has defended the new system as a measure to prevent Hamas from diverting humanitarian aid for militant purposes. However, UN agencies and major international aid groups have rejected the network, citing humanitarian concerns. They argue that the system allows Israel to determine access to aid and fails to meet the urgent need of the population.The UN run aid network, which has been operating throughout the 20 month long war between Israel and Hamas, has faced increasing challenges. Although Israel eased a full blockade in place from March to mid May, UN officials say military restrictions, looting, and the breakdown of law and order continue to obstruct aid distribution.Since the beginning of Israel’s military operation in October 2023, more than 55,300 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza’s health ministry. The ministry reports that over half of the casualties were women and children. The figures do not distinguish between combatants and civilians.Israel launched the campaign aiming to destroy Hamas following the group’s October 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. In that attack, approximately 1,200 people were killed, most of them civilians, and 251 were taken hostage. Of those hostages, 53 still remain in captivity, and fewer than half of them are believed to be alive. Most of the others have been released through ceasefire agreements or other deals.",51 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces and more than 200 were left wounded on Tuesday morning. The deaths occurred as residents gathered near the entry point of the trucks bringing much needed food into the territory. Israeli forces have repeatedly fired on crowds trying to access food distribution points operated by the new aid network.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121909272,imgsize-1184541,width-400,resizemode-4/121909272.jpg"

‘First We Destroy, Then…’: Israel’s Chilling New Confession After Snubbing Putin’s Mediation Offer





Israeli defence minister Israel Katz on Tuesday warned that Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei could have a ""similar fate"" to Iraq's former dictator Saddam Hussein ""Remember what happened to the dictator in the neighbouring country of Iran who took this path against Israel,"" Katz told news agency Reuters.Katz's caveat linking Khamenei's fate to Saddam Hussein could be considered a highly charged statement, reflecting the deepening hostility between the Jewish State and its arch-rival Tehran.Saddam Hussein was overthrown and executed following a US-led invasion in 2003, symbolising the total collapse of his regime.By drawing this parallel, Katz is not only issuing a personal threat to Khamenei but also hinting at the potential for regime change in Iran if its aggressive policies, particularly towards Israel, persist.The statement seems aimed at both psychological warfare and international signalling, reaffirming Israel’s resolve to confront what it perceives as existential threats. According to the Israeli government, the threat stems from the Khamenei-led state actively involved in the enrichment of uranium beyond permitted limits that could potentially make Iran a nuclear-capable nation.Invoking Saddam’s fate serves as a cautionary tale, warning Khamenei that unchecked defiance and militarism could lead to catastrophic personal and national consequences.Saddam was known for his hostility towards Israel, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s. During the 1991 Gulf War, Saddam's forces fired Scud missiles at Israel, aiming to draw Israel into the conflict and destabilise the US-led coalition against him.Despite the provocation, Israel, under US pressure, chose not to retaliate. Saddam’s regime was marked by brutal oppression, regional wars, and defiance of international norms. Eventually, the US invaded Iraq in 2003, citing weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) that were never found. Saddam was captured later that year, put on trial, and executed on December 30, 2006.The conflict between Israel and Iran has intensified for the fifth consecutive day, pushing the region dangerously close to an all-out war. Throughout the night, the area saw heavy missile fire, drone shoot-downs, and swift evacuation directives. Air raid sirens echoed across Israel, while explosions lit up Tehran’s skyline.On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump cut short his appearance at the G7 summit in Canada, warning civilians to ""immediately evacuate Tehran"" -- raising suspicions that much would be brewing in West Asia than what meets the eye.As casualties mount, with evacuation orders affecting hundreds of thousands and major regional air routes coming to a standstill, concerns are growing over the possibility of a wider regional war. Despite the ongoing violence, Trump maintains that ""Iran still wants a deal,"" even as his national security team convenes in Washington.Meanwhile, Israel asserts it has total control over Iranian skies, signalling a further escalation. The situation remains tense and highly volatile.","Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei could have a ""similar fate"" to Iraq's former dictator Saddam Hussein.

Conflicting intelligence interpretations

Blowback risk and strategic stakes





When Israel launched airstrikes against Iran last week, it claimed the attacks were needed to stop Iran from getting close to building a nuclear weapon. But US intelligence had a different view. As per a CNN report, officials said Iran was not actively working on a bomb and was likely still up to three years away from being able to build and use one.According to four people familiar with the US assessment, Iran was not actively building a bomb, and even if it suddenly decided to do so, it was likely two to three years away from delivering a functioning nuclear weapon.Despite major damage to Iran’s Natanz facility, home to advanced centrifuges, the more heavily fortified Fordow enrichment plant remains untouched. According to US officials, the strikes may have delayed Iran’s nuclear progress by only a few months, not derailed it.Israel, defense experts say, lacks the firepower to strike Fordow without specific US military support, including bunker-busting bombs and stealth bombers. “If you really want to dismantle them, it’s either a US military strike or a deal,” said Brett McGurk, a former Middle East envoy under both Trump and Biden.That dilemma now lands squarely on President Donald Trump’s desk. While he has insisted the US is not currently involved in Israel’s attacks, he acknowledged on Sunday: “It’s possible we could get involved.” Speaking from the G7 summit in Canada, Trump urged both Iran and Israel to talk “before it’s too late.”Despite close cooperation between US and Israeli intelligence services, the two nations have long differed on interpreting Iran’s nuclear intent. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard testified in March that the US believes Iran halted weaponization in 2003 and hasn’t resumed it.Pressed on that during a Fox News interview, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted the evidence Israel shared was “absolutely clear” that Iran was working “in a secret plan to weaponize uranium.”Still, the International Atomic Energy Agency noted Iran has enough enriched uranium to theoretically make multiple bombs—but emphasized the country has not taken steps to build or deliver a weapon.US officials now worry that Israel’s strikes could backfire. “You could actually have Iran more inclined to go for a nuclear weapon,” McGurk warned, especially if key infrastructure like Fordow remains intact and Iran feels cornered.Iran has told regional mediators like Qatar and Oman that it won’t return to talks under fire. Meanwhile, the US is realigning its forces in the region, moving the USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Group to the Middle East and deploying missile defense assets to the eastern Mediterranean.Israel’s blitz, aimed at stopping a nuclear sprint, may have instead sparked the very race it feared, one that only diplomacy or deeper US involvement might now halt.","Israel launched airstrikes against Iran last week, claiming the attacks were needed to stop Iran from getting close to building a nuclear weapon.

‘Sign The Deal Or Else’: Trump Offers Iran A Last Chance To Stop War, Threatens With Bunker Busters





Iran on Tuesday confirmed that due to Israel's ""unlawful military attacks"" on the country in the last few days, 224 Iranian citizens, including women and children, have been killed.""On 13th June 2025, the occupying and rogue Zionist regime flagrantly violated the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of Iran by waging military attacks against several locations, including residential areas, killing innocent women and children. As a result of these brutal military attacks, which is the clear violation of all international principles and regulations, 224 of civilian citizens including women and children have been martyred and 1257 others injured so far,"" the Iranian embassy in India said in a press release.Calling the strikes a ""flagrant violation"" of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, Iran said the attacks amounted to ""blatant acts of aggression"" and reiterated that it would exercise its ""legitimate and legal rights"" under Article 51 of the charter.""The Zionist regime's unlawful military attacks on Iran, constitute a flagrant violation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and are blatant acts of aggression against the Islamic Republic of Iran.In accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, Iran reserves its legitimate and legal rights to respond properly and timely to these aggressions,"" the embassy added in its statement.The embassy further accused Israel of hypocrisy, saying a non-NPT nuclear state was targeting a signatory member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and attacking its nuclear facilities and scientists.""The genocidal Zionist regime developed nuclear weapons without being responsive to any international community, including IAEA. It is the sheer hypocrisy that a genocidal non-NPT nuclear entity accuses a NPT member of threatening the global security and attacks its nuclear establishments and assassinate systematically its scientists and university professors,"" the statement said.Israel and Iran exchanged fire again Tuesday, a fifth day of strikes in their most intense confrontation in history, fuelling fears of a drawn-out conflict that could engulf the Middle East.Israel attacked Iran early Friday, targeting its nuclear, missile and military infrastructure.
