'Generic bullet points ... condescending': Congress hits back at Election Commission over rebuttal on party's Haryana poll claims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/generic-bullet-points-condescending-congress-hits-back-at-election-commission-over-rebuttal-on-partys-haryana-poll-claims/articleshow/114845344.cms,"What Congress said

""First, the ECI prefaces its reply by stating the 'exceptional' nature of its indulgence in engaging with us on the issues raised. We do not know who is advising or guiding the Hon'ble Commission, but it seems that the Commission has forgotten that it is a body set up under the Constitution and charged with the discharge of certain crucial functions- both administrative and quasi- judicial. If the Commission grants a recognised National Party a hearing or examines issues raised by them in good faith it is not an 'exception' or 'indulgence'. It is the performance of a duty which it is required to do.""

prefaces its reply by stating the 'exceptional' nature of its indulgence in engaging with us on the issues raised. We do not know who is advising or guiding the Hon'ble Commission, but it seems that the Commission has forgotten that it is a body set up under the Constitution and charged with the discharge of certain crucial functions- both administrative and quasi- judicial. If the Commission grants a recognised National Party a hearing or examines issues raised by them in good faith it is not an 'exception' or 'indulgence'. It is the performance of a duty which it is required to do."" ""If the Commission is refusing to grant us a hearing or refusing to engage on certain complaints (which it has done in the past) then the law allows recourse to the Higher Courts' extraordinary jurisdiction to compel the ECI to discharge this function (as happened in 2019). Se let us disabuse the ECI of this notion that it has in any way, shape or form indulged us.""

""Second, the recent tone of the Commission's communications to the INC is a matter that we refuse to take lightly anymore. Every reply from the ECI now seems to be laced with ad-hominem attacks on either individual leaders or the party itself. The INC's communications confine themselves to issues and are written with a regard for the high office of the CEC and his brother Commissioners. This can be verified from the INC's representations which are in the public domain. However, the ECI's reply are written in a tone that is condescending. If the current ECI's goal is to strip itself of the last vestiges of neutrality, then it is doing a remarkable job at creating that impression. Judges who write decisions do not attack or demonise the party raising the issues. However, if the ECI persists then we shall have no choice but to seek legal recourse to expunge such remarks (a remedy with which the ECI is familiar since it unsuccessfully sought to do the same with a High Court's unflattering but accurate observations after Covid).""

""Third, the 'pattern' sought to be identified by the ECI in Para 8 of its reply is disingenuous, the vast majority of issues raised relate to that short period from the announcement of the Model Code of Conduct to the conclusion of the Elections i.e. the date of counting. The causes of action arise quickly, in literal minutes, and sometimes only become apparent after the results are declared and sometimes after the information from other booths can be compared. If they are not redressed on the ground then they become redundant. And then the only remedy available is an Election Petition which is a lengthy process taking years to resolve. Thus, we approach the ECI with whatever information we have, and the ECI with the vast resources at its command, examines and reviews this information to see if the same is correct. Many times, the ECI has found our information to be correct. Other times, not so. But we do not name and shame the ECI for those moments after the Election is over.""

""Fourth, if we were bad faith actors, then we would never engage with the ECI to begin with. We would not painstakingly document our grievances and present them with legal precedent and arguments. Instead, we would focus on naming and shaming the Commission with examples from the ECI's own recent history which do not shroud it with glory. We would highlight that of over a hundred complaints against the PM and HM, the ECI has taken action in precisely zero complaints, while calling our party president and former party president to account for their actions/speeches. We would point out how the ECI never published a dissent note, actively suppressing it instead, by a former Commissioner in this regard. We would point out that the ECI has almost always fought any move for transparency and increase in VVPAT verification numbers, with the same having to be ordered by the Supreme Court. We challenge the ECI to fact check the above since it finds the INC's misgivings to be based on phantoms. We have many such examples, far more than the same 2-3 examples the ECI seems adamant on repeating.""

We have many such examples, far more than the same 2-3 examples the ECI seems adamant on repeating."" ""Finally, as stated at the outset we are not surprised that the ECI has examined our complaints and given itself a clean chit. The answer given to the question of the machines' fluctuating batteries seeks to confuse rather than clarify. At any rate, the ECI reply is nothing more than a standard and generic set of bullets on how the machines function rather than a specific clarification on specific complaints. In short, while our complaints were specific the ECI response is generic and focused on diminishing the complaints and the petitioners.""

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Friday slammed the Election Commission for its "" generic "" response to the party's complaint over alleged irregularities in the recently concluded Haryana assembly elections, particularly criticising the poll panel's ""tone and tenor, and the language used"".""The Election Commission's reply is nothing more than generic set of bullet points on how machines work rather than specific clarification on our Haryana complaints ... While our complaints in Haryana were specific, the EC's response is generic and focused on diminishing complaints and petitioners,"" the party said in a letter addressed to the Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar.The Congress also took a jab at the EC for giving a ""clean chit to itself"" and slammed the poll panel for its "" condescending "" reply.""If the EC's goal is to strip itself of last vestiges of neutrality, then it's doing remarkable job at creating that impression,"" the Congress added.The sharp criticism came days after the EC categorically dismissed the party's claims of irregularities in the Haryana Assembly elections as ""baseless"" and ""frivolous"".The poll panel had emphasised that it found no evidence to support Congress's allegations, particularly those concerning the display of a 99% battery status on Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) during vote counting.The ECI further said that such unfounded accusations could incite public unrest and disrupt social order, urging political parties to refrain from making sensational complaints during critical electoral phases. In a letter to Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge , the ECI criticised the party for raising doubts about electoral integrity without substantial evidence, stating that this behavior undermines the credibility of the electoral processIn response to the EC's dismissal of Congress's allegations, BJP leaders had reiterated their confidence in the electoral process and characterised Congress's claims as a ""habitual pattern of questioning electoral integrity whenever they face defeat"".BJP leader Sanjay Seth stated, ""It is Congress' character that when they lose, they doubt EVMs and the ECI"".The BJP also emphasised its successful performance in the elections, securing 48 out of 90 seats, and described it as a clear mandate from the people of Haryana.The party said the EC's rebuttal was validation of their electoral victory and a rejection of what they termed ""frivolous complaints"" from Congress.","""The Commission has forgotten that it is a body set up under the Constitution and charged with the discharge of certain crucial functions- both administrative and quasi- judicial"" ""If the Commission is refusing to grant us a hearing or refusing to engage on certain complaints (which it has done in the past) then the law allows recourse to the Higher Courts' extraordinary jurisdiction""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114846096,imgsize-1400617,width-400,resizemode-4/114846096.jpg"

Ek rahenge to safe rahenge: PM's 'unity' mantra on Patel birth anniversary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ek-rahenge-to-safe-rahenge-pms-unity-mantra-on-patel-birth-anniversary/articleshow/114861719.cms,"PM Modi posted this photo on Friday to condole the death of one of BJP’s oldest workers, Bhulai Bhai, who had joined erstwhile Jansangh in 1952

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has amplified his ""unity"" theme by saying that it is the best guarantee for safety. ""Ek rahenge to safe rahenge,"" Modi said while addressing a meeting on the occasion of National Unity Day on Thursday at Kevadia in Gujarat to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel .While his remark was widely seen as a variation of the ""batenge to katenge"" theme which Sangh Parivar has come up with in the wake of the targeting of Hindus in Bangladesh, Modi put it in the context of what he called threat to national unity and the challenges facing the country, including an ideological one and an attempt to chase away investors.The PM said the concept of national unity, which was seen as an ideal, was now sought to be disparaged and had been reduced to a contentious issue.""Aaj koi yeh keh de ki 'ek hain to safe hain' to usse bhi galat tarike se paribhashit karne mein yeh log lagenge (if someone says if we are united, we are safe, then there are forces hell-bent on misinterpreting it),"" Modi said, while warning that people should be careful about forces such as "" urban Naxals "" as they were determined to portray a negative image of India.""As Naxalism is ending in jungles, a new model of urban Naxals is raising its head. Today, urban Naxals target even those who say that you will remain safe if you remain united. We have to identify urban Naxals and unmask them,"" Modi said.""Due to India's increasing strengths and capabilities, some forces in and outside are trying to destabilise the country and spread anarchy. They want to hurt India's economic interests. They want to send a wrong message to foreign investors by portraying a negative image of the nation in the world,"" the PM said.Modi said ""these people"" are also targeting India's armed forces through a ""disinformation campaign"" and trying to ignite sentiments of separatism in the Army. ""These people are trying to divide the country on caste lines. Their only goal is to weaken Indian society as well as people's unity,"" he said.Modi said though these forces always talked about democracy and the Constitution, they were actually working to divide the country. The opposition has repeatedly targeted Modi claiming that India's democracy and Constitution are under attack by BJP Recalling Sardar Patel's contribution, Modi said though there were people who were sceptical of India's unification after independence but Patel made it possible. He added the country would celebrate Patel's 150th birth anniversary for the next two years. Modi said after the success of the 'one nation, one tax' initiative in the form of GST, 'one nation, one ration card', and 'one nation, one health insurance' in the form of Ayushman Bharat scheme, his govt was now working on 'one nation, one election'. ""We are also moving towards the implementation of 'one nation, one secular civil code'. Sardar Patel's message of unity in society is at the core of this decision,"" he said.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi has amplified his ""unity"" theme by saying that it is the best guarantee for safety.

Toxic grains may have killed Madhya Pradesh's 10 elephants at Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/toxic-grains-may-have-killed-mp-jumbos/articleshow/114861687.cms,"Toxic grains may have killed MP jumbos

BHOPAL: A suspected toxin produced by fungus-infected kodo grain was identified as the likely cause behind the tragic death of 10 elephants at Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve in MP's Umaria district.Over the course of three days (Oct 29-31), the elephants succumbed to multiple organ failure, prompting immediate investigation and action. Officials said the remaining three elephants of a herd of 13 were healthy, and were under continuous monitoring.Autopsy of nine elephants were conducted by wildlife health officers from School of Wildlife Forensic and Health, Jabalpur. The final postmortem is scheduled for Saturday.The autopsies revealed a significant quantity of kodo grain in the stomach of the elephants, following which the forest department ordered the destruction of kodo crops in affected areas within two days. The postmortem results also indicated severe damage to the elephants' liver, lungs, intestines and kidneys, further suggesting ingestion of toxic grain.Veterinary doctors indicated a potential link to mycotoxins associated with kodo millet. The wildlife veterinarians are in regular contact with experts from IVRI-Bareilly, WII-Dehradun, the state FSL in Sagar and CCMB-Hyderabad to gain in-depth insights regarding these mycotoxins.Viscera samples of the jumbos were sent to laboratories in Sagar, Jabalpur and Bareilly for further analysis.A team of over 30 doctors and scientists from Wildlife Crime Control, National Tiger Conservation Authority and Special Task Force is currently stationed at Bandhavgarh to assist with the investigation.Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve's deputy director P K Verma told media that initial findings implicated the kodo crop. All range officers have been instructed to inspect and destroy kodo crops in their areas, promising compensation to affected farmers. Verma also noted that some kodo crops were not harvested on time, raising concerns that the elephants may have consumed spoiled grain.Investigators are, however, exploring other angles, too, including potential foul play. A kodo crop spanning eight acres was destroyed the day before the first batch of elephant deaths . Samples of wild elephant faeces are being collected to aid in the investigation.","10 elephants died at Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve in MP's Umaria district.

Elon Musk is not only supporting Donald Trump in the election but also eyeing a government department in the Trump administration.

The report cited a member of the board of the previous company who confirmed that Musk's immigration status in the 1990s was ""not what it should be"".Musk is from South Africa and he dismissed allegations that he violated US immigration law.The report said that in 1995, Musk was admitted to Stanford University's graduate school but didn't enroll in classes. He used his student visa to stay in the US and worked on what later became Zip2, Musk's online business directory, the first company that he founded.Musk received US work authorization in 1997 and became a US citizen in 2002.President Joe Biden called Musk an ""illegal worker"" and said: “That wealthiest man in the world turned out to be an illegal worker here when he was here.""“He was supposed to be in school when he came on a student visa.

Police have arrested one man and continue to search for a second suspect following a shooting incident outside Punjabi singer AP Dhillon 's home on Victoria Island, Canada . The incident, which took place on September 2, involved multiple shots fired at Dhillon’s residence and two vehicles set ablaze, reportedly linked to the Lawrence Bishnoi gang .According to West Shore RCMP, 25-year-old Abjeet Kingra of Winnipeg was arrested on October 30 in Ontario and has been charged with Discharge of a Firearm with Intent and Arson. Kingra is accused of recklessly firing a weapon into Dhillon’s home in the 3300 block of Ravenwood Road, Colwood, and igniting two vehicles in the vicinity. The police report said that law enforcement evacuated an occupant from the residence, and the Colwood Fire Department swiftly responded to extinguish the fires.Superintendent Todd Preston of West Shore RCMP remarked on the dedication of officers working on the case, saying ""West Shore RCMP officers have been working diligently through this investigation, leading to the identification of the suspects involved.

The underworld life you emulate is the life we live. Stay in your place, or you will meet a dog’s death."" The post has heightened concerns over potential motives linked to Dhillon’s portrayal of gang-related themes in his work.","Abjeet Kingra, 25, of Winnipeg was arrested on October 30 in Ontario and has been charged with Discharge of a Firearm with Intent and Arson.

""The security of Chinese citizens is paramount for President Xi (Jinping),"" he said, adding that Beijing iterated its priorities during Xi's discussions with the Pakistan govt during his recent visit to the country.He warned that violence targeting Chinese nationals was causing a rethink on Beijing's investments under its Belt and Road Initiative(BRI). The diplomat stressed the need for Islamabad to take effective remedial measures to prevent the recurrence of such acts of terror acts.In an official response Thursday, Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch termed the Chinese ambassador's statement ""perplexing"" and a stark departure from longstanding diplomatic norms governing bilateral ties.The Chinese officials seldom chastise Islamabad for alleged security failings involving Chinese engineers and workers, and Pakistan’s public response to China’s criticism is also unprecedented.

"Donald Trump's old friend Jeffrey Epstein lived in ‘fear’ when he was President, claims author Michael Wolff",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trumps-old-friend-jeffrey-epstein-lived-in-fear-when-he-was-president-claims-author-michael-wolff/articleshow/114867217.cms,"Jeffrey Epstein, Donald Trump (File photo)

Author Michael Wolff , who conducted extensive interviews with Jeffrey Epstein revealed that the disgraced financier lived in “fear” of his former friend Donald Trump during the latter's presidency.Wolff, who previously included Epstein as a source in his best-selling book Fire and Fury , disclosed these insights shortly before the 2024 presidential election .Epstein, a multimillionaire convicted sex offender , died in a federal jail cell in August 2019, just weeks after his arrest on child sex-trafficking charges.Wolff, who has broken years of silence on the topic, alleged that Epstein showed him photos of Trump with topless young women in his lap during their interviews. These conversations, recorded over an estimated 100 hours, provided a glimpse into Epstein's complex relationship with Trump.Wolff stated on his podcast, Fire and Fury, that Epstein expressed disbelief over Trump's election to the presidency, describing him as “utterly preoccupied” with Trump and “afraid of him.” The author noted that their relationship dated back to the late 1980s, with both men bonding and competing over wealth and women. “I think Epstein saw Trump as essentially Bush League,” Wolff said, highlighting their shared lifestyle as “playboys.”Wolff recounted how both men “shared” the same girlfriend at one point, describing a culture of “sexual excess and license” prevalent among wealthy individuals like Trump and Epstein. However, Wolff claimed Epstein came to believe that Trump was behind law enforcement's investigation into him in 2005, suggesting that Trump was aware of Epstein's activities with underage girls due to his frequent presence in Epstein's world.The fallout between the two men occurred in 2004 when Epstein expressed interest in purchasing the Maison de L’Amitie estate next to Mar-a-Lago . According to Wolff, Trump went behind Epstein's back to bid on the property, resulting in significant tension. Wolff recounted Epstein saying he became “really, really, really p---ed” and began threatening lawsuits and press exposure, leading to his legal troubles.Sources from the Trump camp have countered Wolff’s claims, asserting that Trump had expelled Epstein from Mar-a-Lago upon learning of the sex-trafficking allegations . In 2019, The Washington Post reported on the bitter bidding war between Trump and Epstein for the estate.During their 2017 interviews, Wolff noted that Epstein exhibited genuine fear of Trump, particularly with him as president. “But I couldn’t help but feeling that there was a level of personal fear there,” Wolff remarked. He also stated that several people close to Epstein corroborated this sentiment, with Epstein believing Trump was capable of anything due to his lack of scruples.Despite urging Epstein to publicly share his story, Wolff reported that Epstein dismissed the idea, believing Wolff was naive about how the real world operated. Reflecting on Epstein's controversial death, Wolff described the circumstances of his suicide as “implausible” but suggested that the idea of murder would require extensive silence among many individuals.This revelation from Wolff comes amid the current political climate, with Trump’s campaign denouncing the author's claims as baseless fabrications intended to undermine the upcoming election. A Trump spokesperson labelled Wolff a “disgraced writer who routinely fabricates lies in order to sell fiction books.”","Author Michael Wolff conducted extensive interviews with Jeffrey Epstein.

"Cleared path for 9,000 votes: US Supreme Court rejects GOP bid to block provisional ballots in Pennsylvania",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cleared-path-for-9000-votes-us-supreme-court-rejects-gop-bid-to-block-provisional-ballots-in-pennsylvania/articleshow/114865789.cms,"Representative image (Pic credit: Reuters)

The Supreme Court on Friday denied an emergency appeal from Republicans in Pennsylvania, solidifying a decision to count provisional ballots for voters whose mail-in ballots were rejected.The ruling upholds a Pennsylvania Court decision that election officials must accept these ballots, marking a win for voting-rights advocates who sought this measure, particularly in Republican-controlled counties.Voting rights groups argued that allowing provisional ballots would ensure voters who made minor mistakes with mail-in ballots, such as missing signatures or dates, would not be disenfranchised.According to state data, approximately 9,000 ballots of the over 1.6 million returned had been flagged for such errors as of Thursday.Pennsylvania holds significant weight in this year’s presidential election, with 19 electoral votes , and is expected to be a key player in the tight race between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. The state’s role was similarly pivotal in 2016 and 2020 when the margin was within tens of thousands of votes.As Friday marked the last day for voters in Pennsylvania to request mail-in ballots, election offices saw high turnout and long lines. In Erie County, a judge ruled that 15,000 voters who applied for a mail ballot but hadn’t received it could visit the elections office through Monday to get a replacement. Meanwhile, Bucks County in suburban Philadelphia saw lines stretching outside its Doylestown elections office as voters scrambled to apply for ballots ahead of the 5 p.m. deadline.Nakesha McGuirk, a Democrat from Bensalem, chose to wait despite the lengthy line, saying, “I did not expect the line to be this long. But I’m going to stick it out.” Concerned about her ability to vote on Election Day due to a long commute, McGuirk, a Harris supporter, decided to cast her vote early to avoid any issues. “I figured that rather than run into the risk of not getting home in time to go and vote, that it would be better to just do it this way early,” she added.Patrick Lonieski, a Republican from Buckingham and a Trump supporter, also opted for the convenience of early voting. “I just want to make sure I get my ballot in and it’s counted,” said Lonieski, 62, who was joined by his son, voting for the first time.As the 5 p.m. deadline approached, voters pushed to make it inside in time, with one last person dashing to the door as bystanders encouraged her. “Let’s go!

CNN anchor Jake Tapper provided a live correction of Vice President Kamala Harris 's interpretation of former US President Trump's recent statements at a rally.During her Phoenix, Arizona rally, Harris addressed abortion restrictions, saying, ""Now in America, one in three women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban , many with no exceptions, even for rape and incest, which is immoral. And Donald Trump 's not done. Did everyone hear what he just said yesterday? That he will do what he wants, quote, and here's where I'm going to quote 'whether the women like it or not.'""She further said, ""We must vote because this is the thing. You know, there's a saying that you got to listen to people when they tell you who you are, and this is not the first time he has told us who he is. He does not believe women should have the agency and authority to make decisions about their own bodies.""The actual context of Trump's statement related to his stance on protecting women from illegal immigrants. At his rally, Trump said, ""Kamala has imported criminal migrants from prisons and jails, from insane asylums and mental institutions all over the world from Venezuela to the Congo, including savage criminals who assault, rape, and murder our women and girls. Anyone who would let monsters kidnap and kill our children does not belong anywhere near the Oval Office."" He added, ""I'm gonna do it whether the women like it or not. I'm gonna protect them.""Tapper addressed this discrepancy on ""The Lead,"" saying, ""When Trump said he was going to do something for women, whether they like it or not, whether the women like it or not, he was talking about protecting women, protecting women whether they like it or not.

ISLAMABAD: At least seven people, including five schoolchildren and a police constable, were killed and more than 20 others injured in a roadside bomb explosion in Mastung district of Pakistan ’s southwestern Balochistan province on Friday.State-run PTV news quoted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as saying that the explosion had occurred at a “girls’ high school”, while another post by the outlet said the incident occurred “near girls’ high school chowk”.Naeem Bazai, commissioner for Kalat division, said the attack had occurred near Mastung’s civil hospital, a few metres from the girls’ school.Officials said the blast resulted from an improvised explosive device (IED) fitted inside a motorcycle parked outside a mechanic’s shop. “The IED exploded when a police mobile and a school van were crossing the blast site,” said Mastung district deputy commissioner Baz Muhammad Marri.“Seven people, including a cop and five minor children, were killed and 22 others injured in the explosion,” Marri told the media. “We are ascertaining who was actually targeted because a police mobile and a school van were both passing by the area,” he added.Sarfaraz Bugti, Balochistan’s chief minister, condemned the attack and expressed grief over the loss of lives. “The terrorists have targeted innocent children. We will hold accountable, the perpetrators of the blast,” he said in a statement.Waseem Baig, a spokesman for the Balochistan health department, said 11 injured, including two children, had been shifted to a trauma centre in Quetta, the provincial capital. “Three injured are in critical condition,” he added.Balochistan, Pakistan’s largest province by area, has been facing grave security conditions since the country launched a military offensive there in 2006, vowing to wipe out so-called traitors and terrorists.At least 20 labourers were killed in a rocket attack in October on coal mines in the province’s Duki district. The incident had prompted more than 40,000 other labourers to return to their native areas in Punjab and Sindh. Several workers were killed in Sept when armed men stormed an under-construction house in Panjgur. All slain labourers hailed from Multan, Punjab province.The volatile situation in Balochistan has also been a major challenge for Beijing to complete projects linked to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative.

SINDH: Amnesty International has condemned the suffering of thousands of Sindhis who are affected due to severe flooding and a surge in water-borne diseases in the backdrop of the Pakistan government's inaction, according to the rights group statement.Following major flooding in August 2024, more than 140,000 people were displaced with many now living in tents. Months later, affected communities are still struggling with health risks and lost livelihoods compounded by little international or government support.With disease rampant due to stagnant floodwaters, older people, children and pregnant women are at increased risk of illness and death.Amnesty said that the Sindh government has failed to guarantee essential services such as healthcare, food, and housing. This has led to the violation of economic, social, and cultural rights as outlined by the international human rights ratified by Pakistan, the statement said.Scott Edwards, Crisis Response Programme Director at Amnesty International, stated, ""Tens of thousands of people have been abandoned by the Sindh government and the international community after being devastated again by major floods. Many impacted communities were harmed by record-breaking floods in 2022 and have struggled to rebuild their lives.""Edwards emphasized the urgency of addressing climate changeand its humanitarian impacts, calling for immediate action from both the international community and Pakistauthorities. ""Climate change is not a tentative threat; lives are being lost today to global inaction and inadequate humanitarian response,"" he said.Shazia Chandio lost her son during the floods, she told Amnesty International, for one day and one night he was suffering diarrhoea, and then the next day he died."" She further expressed her sorrow and said, ""Nobody has helped. Those who have money here move to a safer place, but those who don't have money stay.""In September 2024, Amnesty International visited eight flood-affected villages in the Badin and Dadu districts of Sindh. They interviewed 36 residents including groups such as older adults, people with disabilities, and children. The organisation urged people to support the people who suffered due to flooding.","Amnesty International has condemned the suffering of thousands of Sindhis who are affected due to severe flooding.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan began a nationwide vaccination campaign Monday to protect 45 million children from polio after a surge in new cases that has hampered years of efforts to stop the disease in one of the two countries where it has never been eradicated.Pakistan regularly launches such campaigns, but violence targeting the health workers and police assigned to escort them is common. Militants falsely claim the vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children.The campaign is the third this year and will continue until Sunday ""in response to the alarming increase in polio cases,"" said Ayesha Raza Farooq , the prime minister's adviser for the polio eradication program. ""We are re-energized in our efforts to combat polio,"" she said in a statement.During the door-to-door campaign, children younger than 5 will be vaccinated and given drops of Vitamin A supplements to enhance their immunity.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently met with front-line health workers, urging them to ensure no child was left unvaccinated by going door-to-door.Anwarul Haq, who is the coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, also urged parents to fully cooperate with polio workers. ""Polio has no cure, but it can be prevented with this readily available vaccine,"" he said.Pakistan has recorded 41 cases across 71 districts so far this year, Farooq said. Most were reported from southwestern Balochistan and southern Sindh province, following by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and eastern Punjab province.The surge in cases in new locations is worrying authorities since previous cases were from the restive northwest bordering Afghanistan, where the Taliban government in September suddenly stopped a door-to-door vaccination campaign.Authorities in Pakistan say the Afghan Taliban's recent decision to stop door-to-door anti-polio campaign will have repercussions beyond the Afghan border, as people from both sides frequently travel to each other's country. The World Health Organization has confirmed 18 polio cases in Afghanistan this year.Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries in the world where the spread of polio has never been stopped. It is one of the world's most infectious diseases, so it continues to spread anywhere people are not fully vaccinated.

He stated, ""Some KP ministers are more focused on benefits than promoting the goals of the PTI.""The MNA mentioned that he had received threats of expulsion from the party but asserted that such threats would not dissuade him. He indicated his plan to meet with the PTI founder to discuss the current situation in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government. He noted that he would inform Imran about alleged misconduct by certain officials, whom he believes should face prosecution rather than be rewarded with government positions.Citing a previous incident, Marwat criticized the recent promotion of a police officer who reportedly fired at him in Bajaur. He noted that the officer has now been elevated to the position of senior superintendent of police (SSP) in Peshawar.The report further stated that the PTI leader stated that he would update Imran on grievances to confront the current situation within PTI's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa leadership. He urged for a strong strategy to aid in securing the release of the party's founder.Marwat's comments follow reports of internal conflicts within the PTI that surfaced during the D-Chowk protests earlier this month and later over the voting for the 26th Constitutional Amendment , where some party members voted in favour of changes that contradicted the party's policy.In a related development, Zain Qureshi resigned as the PTI's deputy parliamentary leader in the National Assembly a day ago after receiving a show-cause notice for severing ties with the PTI leadership during the passage of the amendment in both houses.

To assist commuters traveling from Teen Hatti, the police offered an alternative route through PIB Colony.The factions of the Battagram Trade Union have announced a complete shutter-down strike and sit-in beginning Tuesday in response to the widespread power outage in Karachi district, Pakistan. Until then, the union will withhold electricity bill payments.The outrage affected small businesses like tailors and welders, creating a virtual halt in commercial activities. This has frustrated both residents and business firms in the same manner as they rely on electricity for their daily purposes.As per the Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) department, ""The power cuts took place after an order taken by the High Court related to an alleged incident involving the assault of a female prisoner at the Battagram sub-jail.""Conversely, the trade union has rejected the explanation for the power outage, labeling it as ""ridiculous.""

Eight people were killed, and five others sustained injuries on Saturday when a suicide bomber triggered an explosion at a checkpoint near Mir Ali, a town situated in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, close to the Afghan border .The attacker detonated the bomb while riding on the back of a motorbike rickshaw, according to an unnamed local police officer who spoke to AFP.The casualties included four police officers, two members of a state paramilitary force and two civilians. The police officer further stated that among the five wounded, three are in critical condition and have been moved to a nearby military hospital for treatment.An unnamed local government official corroborated to AFP the reported number of fatalities and injuries resulting from the attack.This comes a day after ten police officers were killed in an attack on a check post near the Afghan border. The attack happened in the Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. About 20 to 25 militants targeted the Frontier Constabulary post, a police assistance force. The Pakistan Taliban , also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), claimed the attack in a statement to AFP.Since the Taliban's resurgence in Afghanistan in 2021, Pakistan has faced a surge in terrorism, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, which border Afghanistan. Recent anti-terror operations in North Waziristan led to the elimination of about a dozen militants this month. In the most recent operation Pakistani security forces killed nine insurgents, including a high-level target, in a shootout overnight in a former stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban in the volatile northwestern region that borders Afghanistan, the military said Thursday.According to a Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) report, violence increased sharply in 2024, with a 90% surge in fatalities in the third quarter alone. The year's total fatalities, now at 722, have already surpassed all of 2023, with 97% occurring in these two provinces, marking the highest rate in a decade.","A suicide bomber triggered an explosion at a checkpoint near Mir Ali, a town situated in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, close to the Afghan border.

"Thousands of Hindus protest in Bangladesh, demand withdrawal of cases against their leaders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/thousands-of-hindus-protest-in-bangladesh-demand-withdrawal-of-cases-against-their-leaders/articleshow/114858050.cms,"Bangladesh Hindus participate in rally to demand that interim government withdraw all cases against their leaders (Photo :AP)

Minority Hindus gathered in large numbers on Friday to protest in Bangladesh , with approximately 30,000 demonstrating in Chattogram under police and military protection. Similar demonstrations occurred across the country as Hindus sought protection from attacks and demanded the withdrawal of sedition cases against their community leaders, as reported by AP.Hindu groups reported an increase in attacks since early August, following the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina after a student-led uprising. Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus , who leads the interim government, says the reported figures are exaggerated.Hindus, who constitute about 8% of Bangladesh’s population of nearly 170 million, claim they have experienced over 2,000 attacks since August 4. They believe the interim government is not offering adequate protection, and they fear the growing influence of hardline Islamists.Activists continue advocating for minority protection laws, a dedicated ministry, and other demands including extended holiday periods for religious festivals.The Chattogram protest was organised quickly after sedition charges were filed against 19 Hindu leaders on Wednesday, including priest Chandan Kumar Dhar. This was related to an October 25 rally in which a group allegedly placed a saffron flag above the Bangladesh flag, considered disrespectful. Two leaders were arrested, causing anger in the Hindu community.Leaders claim these charges are politically motivated and are demanding their withdrawal within 72 hours. Another rally is scheduled for Saturday in Dhaka.Supporters of Hasina's Awami League party and ally Jatiya Party also report being targeted since Hasina's removal. The Jatiya Party headquarters was vandalized and set on fire on Thursday. Jatiya Chairman G M Quader stated, “We will continue to hold rallies and demand our rights. We are not afraid to risk our lives.” The party plans a rally in Dhaka on Saturday to protest rising commodity prices and what they describe as false charges against their leaders.","Hindus claim they have experienced over 2,000 attacks since August 4.
