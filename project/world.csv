What does the

postmortem report

say?

The report said the death was due to smothering and throttling.

Prima facie, death has been due to gagging and there were multiple signs of injuries and struggle on the body.

The mouth and throat were constantly pressed to prevent screaming. The throat was strangled to suffocate. The thyroid cartilage broke due to this strangulation.

There were blood stains on the face, eyes and face, scratch marks on various parts of the body and bleeding from the private parts.

There were injuries on the lips, abdomen, right hand and fingers while a collar bone was broken.

There are aberration marks and bruise marks on the victim’s face, on the eyes till the neck.

The scratch marks on the woman's face, likely caused by the accused's fingernails, suggest that she desperately tried to fight back.

The report mentions that the accused “got certain advantage as the victim was in deep sleep at the time of the attack.”

She had tried to resist, and there were deep mark injuries and scratches on the hands of the accused as well.

The report, however, said that there have been no fracture or breakage of the collar bone or pelvis as reported earlier in the initial phase of observation.

What are preliminary forensic findings?

The scratch mark injuries on Sanjay’s body matched with the skin and blood samples collected from the nails of the victim.

Fact check: What do the claims and police responses reveal about the case?

A source from the Kolkata Police revealed that a claim circulating involves semen from three individuals being found on the doctor’s body. However, a police officer said, “It is impossible to distinguish semen from three individuals with the naked eye during an autopsy.” Medical science defines what an adult male is capable of, and what is being circulated is scientifically impossible, source added.

The second claim circulating on social media is that the woman’s collarbone and pelvic guard were broken. However, police say that based on the autopsy report, she did not have any broken bones.

The third claim is that the Kolkata Police informed the family about a possible suicide, but police say the family confirmed the call did not come from them.

Fourthly, there is a rumor that a police officer offered a large sum of money to silence the murdered doctor’s father. However, the police clarified that, following the Nirbhaya case, the state is required to provide financial compensation to the families of victims of murder, acid attacks, rape, and molestation.

CBI team arrives in Kolkata to begin investigation

CBI takes cue from parents’ charges, grills RG Kar ex-principal for 24 hrs

KOLKATA: A Kolkata Police civic volunteer, Sanjay Roy , was taken into custody on Saturday in connection with the brutal rape and murder of a second-year postgraduate trainee doctor at RG Kar Hospital . The arrest came just six hours after the police force had formed a seven-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the case.Read also: Kolkata Doctor Rape-Murder Case Live: IMA’s nationwide strike begins, here's what's open and closed; RG Kar Hospital vandalism victims recall night of horror On Sunday, investigators discovered the most compelling evidence against Sanjay Roy, the prime suspect in the rape and murder of the 31-year-old doctor.Traces of blood and skin found under the victim's fingernails perfectly matched Roy's DNA and corresponded to the injuries he sustained during the attack, said a senior cop.According to a senior police officer, the victim, despite being half-asleep, had put up a desperate fight against her attacker, and it was this struggle that provided investigators with the crucial evidence they needed to link Roy to the crime.“Rumours don’t help but harm probe,” the Kolkata Police wrote on their social media page after handing over all probe details to the CBI. They stated that they had done their best over the past four days and would continue to assist the CBI moving forward.The police also emphasised that certain ""misinformation"" being spread is either ""scientifically"" or ""legally"" impossible.The murder has triggered widespread outrage with doctors and nurses protesting in Kolkata and other parts of India. Outpatient services and routine surgeries were severely disrupted in government hospitals nationwide on Monday as resident doctors protested the rape and murder of a colleague at Kolkata's R G Kar Medical College and Hospital. The demonstrations were most prominent in Delhi and Kolkata, which became the focal points of the protest.The protesting doctors are calling for a CBI investigation into the incident and the urgent implementation of a central law to safeguard healthcare workers from violence.Sandip Ghosh , the principal of RG Kar Medical College , has resigned from his post in the wake of the incident. Within four hours, he was appointed as the principal of Calcutta National Medical College (CNMC).West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has warned the Kolkata police that the investigation will be transferred to the CBI if they are unable to solve the case by Sunday.A Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) team has arrived in Kolkata to take over the investigation into the rape and murder of a female trainee doctor at a state-run medical college, as ordered by the Calcutta high court.Hours after the CBI filed an FIR in the RG Kar rape-murder case in New Delhi, the agency took custody of primary suspect, Sanjay Roy. They took him for a medical examination and began interrogating him at its CGO Complex office.Senior officials from New Delhi reached Kolkata Tuesday night and formed three teams. One team took custody of the accused, another visited RG Kar with forensic experts from CFSL Delhi, and the third team reviewed call records and other data from the victim’s mobile phone.Sources revealed that the CBI is investigating the victim’s activities in the hours leading up to her death, focusing on the people she interacted with or communicated. Kolkata Police has already provided related documents, case diary, CCTV footage from the hospital and items from the seizure list, including a Bluetooth earphone wire found at the crime scene.Initially, the accused was taken to Command Hospital, but they informed the team that they could not conduct the examination there. He was then transferred to BR Singh Hospital in Sealdah, where the medical process was completed. The CBI team, along with members of the Central Forensic Laboratory, arrived at RG Kar Hospital around 3.40 pm and proceeded directly to the seminar hall where the young doctor’s body was found on Friday.On Thursday, CBI officials visited the home of the doctor who was allegedly raped and murdered at a hospital in Kolkata. As part of their ongoing investigation, they spoke with her parents and gathered information about the timing of the call they received from the hospital, notifying them of their daughter's untimely death.The officers also inquired about the victim's friends and whether she had mentioned any issues or concerns at the state-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital , where she was a postgraduate trainee doctor.In addition to speaking with the victim's parents, the CBI interrogated five doctors from the hospital, as well as the former medical superintendent-cum-vice-principal (MSVP), principal, and the head of the Chest Department where the victim's body was discovered. They also spoke with the officer-in-charge of the Tala police station, which has jurisdiction over the hospital.As part of their investigation, the CBI has requested detailed information about Civic Volunteer Sanjay Roy, who was arrested after the victim's body was found on Friday. This includes his call detail record and mobile tower location, among other relevant data.CBI officers on Friday questioned former RG Kar principal Sandip Ghosh at their office late into the night. The development came a while after Calcutta High Court posted Ghosh’s plea, seeking protection for him and his family, for hearing on Monday.Ghosh had resigned as principal on Monday, only to be put in charge of another state-run medical college and hospital around four hours later. A day later, the high court, expressing shock, had commented on Ghosh’s “power”, and ordered him to go on a long leave.On Friday, he was stopped by CBI officers near City Centre, Salt Lake, asked to get out of his car, and taken to the CBI office at the CGO Complex. At the time of going to press, more than 10 hours after he was taken in, he was still being questioned.RG Kar Medical College and Hospital former principal Sandip Ghosh’s questioning by CBI, which started Friday (August 16) afternoon, continued till 11.30pm on Saturday, with only a short break in the early hours, when he was allowed to go home. The marathon 24-hour interrogation over two days is the longest by the central agency in any case in Bengal in the recent past.The questioning began a day after a team of CBI officials, led by joint director V Chandrasekhar, spoke to the parents of the deceased 31-year-old postgraduate trainee doctor at their Sodepur residence. The parents have alleged that their daughter “was under mental pressure and was reluctant to go to work” and the hospital had tried to pass off the rape-murder as suicide.Ghosh was allowed to go home for a short break at 2.30am Saturday after 11 hours of grilling. However, at 10.30am, he was back at the central agency’s CGO complex office with several files.According to sources, the agency’s special crime unit bombarded Ghosh with a barrage of questions, including when he learnt of the PGT doctor’s death, who informed him and what steps he took on receiving the news. The former principal claimed he was in no way linked to the doctor’s death.","Civic volunteer, Sanjay Roy, was arrested on Saturday in connection with the rape and murder of a second-year post-graduate doctor at Kar Hospital in Kolkata.

Who is Sanjay Roy?

Roy joined Kolkata Police’s Disaster Management Group as a civic volunteer in 2019 but used “the right channels” to shift to Kolkata Police’s Welfare Cell.

He reportedly used “connections” to live on the premises of KP’s 4th Battalion. This association helped him get posted at RG Kar Hospital.

Hospital. Roy had been assigned to the police outpost at RG Kar Hospital on several occasions, sometimes for extended periods, granting him easy access to all hospital departments.

What are his position and entitlements?

It has come to light that Roy is a member of the Police Welfare Board’s 14-member central committee, and his 'disapproval' could lead to the transfer of police officers.

Roy received 5 liters of free fuel daily to use a police motorcycle for personal purposes. The motorcycle, which had a police sticker, was seized on Monday.

The bike Sanjay Roy used to ride had a police sticker on it

What are the allegations against him?

A police inquiry into Sanjay Roy has uncovered multiple allegations against him, including extortion, intimidation, and threats against women.

He was found guilty on at least two occasions—first for assaulting his pregnant wife in 2022, and later for misbehaving with a female doctor a few weeks ago—but he was never censured. He managed to evade capture even after assaulting his pregnant wife.

On Monday, a woman went to Lalbazar to report that Roy had been harassing her by phone for the past three months. He first approached her at RG Kar Hospital under the pretext of buying medicine, obtained her number from the prescription, and has since pressured and threatened her to meet.

Another complaint against Roy concerns police transfers. An officer suspects that his significant “influence” may have played an active role in at least six transfers from the Tala police station and Shyambazar police outpost in recent weeks.

What practices is Sanjay Roy known for?

Charging bribe for free or services at discounts at the hospital — like beds and various tests.

Promising admission of patients at nearby nursing homes for a fee in case they don’t get admission at R G Kar Medical College and Hospital.

Taking money from innocent job seekers promising them jobs as civic volunteers or in the police force.

What gave him away?

A torn earphone discovered in the seminar room on the third floor of the emergency building, where the young doctor's body was found on Friday, led to his identification.

discovered in the seminar room on the third floor of the emergency building, where the young doctor's body was found on Friday, led to his identification. CCTV footage captured Roy entering the emergency building at 4am wearing a bluetooth device around his neck. When he left the building 40 minutes later, the earphone was no longer visible. The device was later found to be paired with his cellphone.

What happened at RG Kar on Friday?

Post-midnight, deceased doctor and four colleagues ordered food and had dinner in the seminar room while watching Neeraj Chopra win silver.

After the meal, her colleagues departed, and she remained in the room to continue her studies. She handed over her duties to colleagues, and went to the seminar hall to study. At around 2 am, someone from the hospital visited her in the seminar hall to discuss a patient’s treatment.

Police said that around the same time, she had received a message from her cousin and replied at 2.35 am, saying everything was ""normal"" till then. Before 3 am, a hospital staff member found her lying under a red blanket in the seminar hall. It is assumed that the accused, Sanjay, entered the seminar hall after that.

At 3am, she was seen sleeping in the room.

Around 4am, the accused entered the seminar room, sexually assaulted her. When she attempted to resist, the perpetrator throttled her.

The woman's broken glasses were found next to her laptop, suggesting that she fought her attacker for a considerable time, trying to defend herself.

Her eyes had blood clots from being throttled. Reports indicate that the accused covered her mouth forcefully and slammed her head against the wall, causing injuries to her face. While her thyroid cartilage was not fractured, it did have a blood clot, suggesting the attacker pressed hard to prevent her from escaping. Nail marks on her face indicate she tried to scream but was silenced.

The next morning, when her body was found at 7.30am, her mask was discovered a short distance away. A closed laptop was found near her head, with a diary and her mobile phone placed on top of it. A plastic water bottle was found overturned next to her head.

on the 31-year-old doctor. The report said there were multiple signs of injuries and struggle on the body.

There were blood stains on the face, eyes and face, scratch marks on various parts of the body and bleeding from the private parts.

There were injuries on the lips, abdomen, right hand and fingers while a collar bone was broken.

The report said the death was due to smothering and throttling.

Prima facie, death has been due to gagging and there were multiple signs of injuries and struggle on the body.

The mouth and throat were constantly pressed to prevent screaming. The throat was strangled to suffocate. The thyroid cartilage broke due to this strangulation.

There are aberration marks and bruise marks on the victim’s face, on the eyes till the neck.

The scratch marks on the woman's face, likely caused by the accused's fingernails, suggest that she desperately tried to fight back.

The report mentions that the accused “got certain advantage as the victim was in deep sleep at the time of the attack.”

She had tried to resist, and there were deep mark injuries and scratches on the hands of the accused as well.

The report, however, said that there have been no fracture or breakage of the collar bone or pelvis as reported earlier in the initial phase of observation.

What are preliminary forensic findings?

The scratch mark injuries on Sanjay’s body matched with the skin and blood samples collected from the nails of the victim.

Fact check: What do the claims and police responses reveal about the case?

A source from the Kolkata Police revealed that a claim circulating involves semen from three individuals being found on the doctor’s body. However, a police officer said, “It is impossible to distinguish semen from three individuals with the naked eye during an autopsy.” Medical science defines what an adult male is capable of, and what is being circulated is scientifically impossible, source added.

The second claim circulating on social media is that the woman’s collarbone and pelvic guard were broken. However, police say that based on the autopsy report, she did not have any broken bones.

The third claim is that the Kolkata Police informed the family about a possible suicide, but police say the family confirmed the call did not come from them.

Fourthly, there is a rumor that a police officer offered a large sum of money to silence the murdered doctor’s father. However, the police clarified that, following the Nirbhaya case, the state is required to provide financial compensation to the families of victims of murder, acid attacks, rape, and molestation.

The clash occurred around 3:24 am local time on Monday, with a short video posted by the China Coast Guard on social media capturing the incident.According to China's maritime security statements, the Philippine vessel, which had previously been warned, entered waters near Second Thomas Shoal after being blocked from Sabina Shoal.Gan Yu, a spokesperson for the China Coast Guard, claimed that two Philippine Coast Guard vessels ""illegally intruded"" into the area around Sabina Shoal early Monday.Gan criticized the Philippines for ""provoking and causing trouble,"" and for violating agreements related to supply missions to a vessel grounded at Second Thomas Shoal.

What was even more bizarre was the fact that some of the daily wage labourers residing illegally here, used to attend daily piece-meal works at Tirupati and used to come back to Tirumala by the night.According to TTD VGO Surendra, people living in the unauthorised shelter sheds will be evicted in a day or two and also maintained that unauthorised hawkers operating at other places on the hill town will also be flushed out soon.","Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams vigilance and security wing along with the local police conducted raids at various places on the hill town.

One confirmed case has been reported, with several others suspected, and the virus was detected in wastewater at six different locations in July.Despite being eradicated in Gaza 25 years ago, polio vaccinations have significantly decreased since the war began 10 months ago, turning the territory into a breeding ground for the virus, according to aid groups.The situation is exacerbated by the hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians living in tent camps that lack clean water and proper sewage and garbage disposal.Aid organizations are preparing to vaccinate over 600,000 children in the coming weeks. However, they emphasize that these ambitious vaccination plans are impossible to execute without a pause in the fighting between Israel and Hamas.The World Health Organization ( WHO ) and UNICEF , the United Nations children's agency, issued a joint statement on Friday, stating that a minimum of a seven-day pause is necessary to implement a mass vaccination plan. The UN aims to bring 1.6 million doses of polio vaccine into Gaza, where sanitation and water systems have been destroyed, leaving open pits of human waste in crowded tent camps.Families living in these camps have limited access to clean water and soap, making it difficult to maintain proper hygiene.Polio, a highly contagious disease that primarily spreads through contact with contaminated feces, water, or food, can cause difficulty breathing and irreversible paralysis, usually in the legs. It primarily affects young children and can sometimes be fatal. Mercy Corps estimates that approximately 50,000 babies born since the war began have not been immunized against polio.Health workers in Gaza are preparing for a mass vaccination campaign set to begin at the end of August and continue into September, with the goal of immunizing 640,000 children under the age of 10 over two rounds of vaccinations, according to WHO. The Israeli military body responsible for Palestinian civilian affairs, COGAT, has stated that it is ""preparing to support a comprehensive vaccination campaign"" and is working with various organizations to bring more vaccines into Gaza.Hamas has expressed its support for a seven-day truce to facilitate the vaccinations, with cease-fire talks set to resume in Cairo next week.The alarm over polio was first raised in July when the WHO announced that sewage samples collected from six locations in Gaza tested positive for a variant of the virus used in vaccines. This weakened form of the virus can mutate into a stronger version and cause an outbreak in areas with inadequate immunization, according to WHO.The challenges in Gaza, where polio hasn't been seen in a quarter-century, include raising awareness among health workers to recognize symptoms, as the territory's health care system has been devastated by the war, and workers are overwhelmed treating the wounded and patients with various ailments. Before the war, 99% of Gaza's population was vaccinated against polio, but that figure has now dropped to 86%, according to WHO. The goal is to restore polio immunization levels in Gaza to above 95%.","One confirmed case of polio in Gaza, with several others suspected.

Punches flew unabated in the Turkish Parliament on Friday as lawmakers discussed the fate of a jailed opposition leader Can Atalay , whose parliamentary immunity was revoked earlier this year.However, Turkey's constitutional court earlier this month struck down Parliament's decision to oust Atalay from his parliament seat.The leaders were meeting following the court's order to determine the future of the leader.Atalay, who is a lawyer, won his seat last year after having campaigned from his prison cell.Ahmet Sik , a fellow member of the leftist Workers' Party of Turkey (TIP), defended Atalay against the attacks on him by ruling party lawmakers.""It's no surprise that you call Atalay a terrorist,"" he said.""All citizens should know that the biggest terrorists of this country are those seated on those benches,"" he added, indicating the ruling majority, according to news agency Reuters.Sik's comment infuriated the ruling party lawmakers, leading to chaos following which the chairman called for a break.That comment drew angry responses from ruling party lawmakers, prompting the chairman to call a break.Scuffles broke out after former footballer Alpay Ozalan, a lawmaker from Erdogan's ruling AKP party, walked to the rostrum and shoved Sik to the ground, said an AFP journalist in parliament.Sik was then punched on the ground several times by ruling party lawmakers.At least two opposition MPs were injured during the fistfight.In January, Atalay was stripped of his parliamentary seat following a heated session, despite efforts by fellow leftist deputies to halt the proceedings.He is one of seven individuals who were sentenced to 18 years in prison in 2022, following a controversial trial that also resulted in the philanthropist Osman Kavala being jailed for life.Despite being imprisoned, the 48-year-old Atalay campaigned and was elected as a member of parliament for the earthquake-stricken Hatay province in the May 2023 general election, representing the leftist TIP party, which holds three seats in the parliament.However, Atalay's election victory led to a legal confrontation between President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's supporters and opposition leaders, pushing Turkey to the brink of a constitutional crisis last year. The decision to remove Atalay from parliament in January came after the Supreme Court of appeals upheld his conviction, paving the way for his parliamentary immunity to be revoked.On August 1, the constitutional court, responsible for reviewing the compliance of judges' rulings with Turkey's basic law, published its ruling on the case, declaring Atalay's removal from parliament as ""null and void"".

Which countries have confirmed mpox virus cases?

WHO warns more mpox to come in Europe after case in Sweden

What is mpox? What are its symptoms?

NEW DELHI: Pakistan has confirmed its first mpox (earlier known as monkeypox ) case of the year after a 34-year-old man who recently returned from Saudi Arabia tested positive for the virus, reported ARY News. The individual, a resident of Mardan, arrived in Pakistan on August 3 and began showing symptoms shortly after reaching Peshawar.The diagnosis was confirmed by Khyber Medical University in Peshawar, and the positive result was verified on August 13, marking the first report of monkeypox in Pakistan for 2024.Health officials have begun contact tracing efforts to identify and monitor individuals who were in close contact with the patient, including fellow passengers on his flight from Saudi Arabia.Earlier in 2023, three passengers were diagnosed with monkeypox at Karachi's Jinnah International Airport. All three were Pakistani citizens aged between 30 and 45. The passengers were admitted to the infectious disease hospital.China will monitor individuals and goods entering the country for mpox over the next six months, according to a statement from its customs administration issued on Friday.Last year, China announced that mpox would be managed as a Category B infectious disease. This designation allows officials to take emergency measures such as restricting gatherings, suspending work and school, or sealing off areas during an outbreak.Category B infectious diseases in China currently include Covid-19, AIDS, and SARS.The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that over 14,000 cases and 524 deaths from mpox have been recorded in Africa this year, surpassing last year's figures. More than 96% of these cases and deaths have occurred in Congo, where a new, potentially more transmissible variant is causing concern among scientists.Sweden's public health agency announced on Thursday that the new mpox variant has been identified in a person who recently traveled to Africa and sought healthcare upon returning to Stockholm.WHO warned further imported cases of the new, more dangerous mpox strain in Europe were likely, after Sweden announced the first such infection outside Africa in an outbreak that has killed hundreds in the DR Congo.The WHO's European regional office in Copenhagen said it was discussing with Sweden how best to manage the newly detected case. ""The confirmation of mpox Clade 1 in Sweden is a clear reflection of the interconnectedness of our world,"" it said in a statement.""There are likely to be further imported cases of Clade 1 in the European region over the coming days and weeks, and it is imperative that we don't stigmatise travellers or countries/regions. Travel restrictions and border closures don't work and should be avoided,"" it added.Mpox, also known as monkeypox, first identified in 1958 in monkeys, has recently spread to over 70 countries. The virus, which is similar to smallpox but milder, has caused outbreaks globally since it was confirmed to spread via sex in 2022.Initially, mpox was mostly seen in central and West Africa among people in close contact with infected animals. However, the 2022 outbreaks marked a significant shift, making it a global concern.Mpox belongs to the same family of viruses as smallpox. It causes milder symptoms such as fever, chills, and body aches.

A carefree attitude amidst chaos

Legal battle and denial

In a scandal that has rocked Hollywood, Jasveen Sangha—dubbed the "" Ketamine Queen "" — is accused of supplying the drugs that led to Matthew Perry 's tragic death last October. The extravagant lifestyle of this so-called "" celebrity drug dealer "" is now under the spotlight, revealing a life of opulence funded by a reportedly lucrative underground ketamine operation catering to the elite.As per reports, Sangha’s luxurious existence included foreign escapades to exotic destinations such as Mexico, Spain, Italy, and Dubai, alongside a fleet of high-end vehicles like a Range Rover and a leased 2024 BMW. Her opulent tastes extended to lavish beauty treatments, including Botox and IV drips, as revealed by court documents and sources close to the case. As per the POST, “She was known for her glamorous appearance, flaunting her wealth and connections in the celebrity world,” said a source.The Department of Justice recently uncovered a staggering drug cache in a raid on Sangha's high-end residence. Authorities reported seizing ""80 ketamine vials, thousands of methamphetamine and cocaine pills, Xanax, and other illicit medications."" This discovery came after months of Sangha evading law enforcement, while she continued to indulge in luxury shopping, parties, and travel.Despite the gravity of the allegations, those close to Sangha describe a chilling nonchalance about her situation. “She seemed carefree, like she didn’t have a worry in the world,” a longtime friend was quoted as saying by the POST. “She was always up for parties or dinners, acting as if nothing was amiss, even as the walls were closing in.”In the days leading up to her arrest on August 16, Sangha reportedly visited a hair salon, had her nails done, and attended Hollywood parties. Federal authorities allege that Sangha's brazen lifestyle continued unabated, reflecting a disturbing indifference to the deadly consequences of her alleged actions.Sangha, who has pleaded 'not guilty' to the charges, is facing a complex legal battle. Among those arrested in connection with Perry’s death were his doctors, an assistant, and other associates. The prosecution argues that Sangha’s lavish lifestyle demonstrates her financial ability to flee, adding further tension to the case.A pretrial motion noted, “Based on the defendant’s lifestyle and spending, she has the financial means to flee.” Sangha’s court appearance will be closely watched as the investigation into the fatal ketamine overdose continues to unfold.","Jasveen Sangha is accused of supplying the drugs that led to Matthew Perry's tragic death last October.

""Over the last several years, there's been this kind of perversion that has taken place, I think, which is to suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down,"" she said. ""When what we know is the real and true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.

The Race to Cut a Powerfully Simple Ad

The Bid to 'Kill Hercules in the Crib'

A Contest That Stretched Past Election Day

The first thing to know about Kamala Harris ' campaign for California attorney general is that she was not necessarily favored to win.It was 2010 -- the pinnacle of the Tea Party's power -- and Harris was running statewide for the first time and struggling to shed the same San Francisco liberal label that Donald Trump is yet again wielding as an epithet.Harris, then 45, was already seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party. ""The female Barack Obama,"" Gwen Ifill had memorably tagged her the year before. But plenty of rising stars are snuffed out early, and Harris was facing a formidable Republican foe that year in Steve Cooley , the popular and moderate district attorney of Los Angeles County.Cooley's reputation as an evenhanded, corruption-busting prosecutor had put him tied or narrowly ahead of Harris entering October -- largely on the strength of his uncommon popularity for a Republican in Los Angeles. He had won election three times in what is the state's most populous Democratic stronghold.Harris was running out of both time and money when she arrived at their only debate on the first Tuesday of October. Then, about 45 minutes into the hourlong clash, Cooley gave an answer that was frank, fateful and foolish.It was a turning point in the campaign. Harris would escape a month later with one of the narrowest statewide victories in modern California history -- by less than 0.85% of the vote. Yet even on election night, Harris' chances had appeared so bleak that Cooley declared victory. The race remained unsettled for three weeks.""Everyone writes history like it's all inevitable,"" said Harris' chief strategist in the 2010 race, Averell ""Ace"" Smith. Her first statewide win, he said, was anything but.""That was as close to a near-death experience for a political career as you can get,"" said Chris Jankowski, a Republican strategist who then led a national GOP group that spent $1 million in a failed bid to end Harris' career before it could really get started. ""If she had lost that race, she would not be the nominee for president -- no chance.""Now, as Harris arrives this week at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, seeking to become the first woman to serve as president in U.S. history, that long-forgotten moment at a debate nearly 14 years ago stands out as one of the least known yet most consequential pivot points in the arc of her political career.This is the story of those 47 seconds -- and what followed.To say the lone faceoff of the 2010 attorney general's race drew little fanfare would be an understatement.It was held at noon far from the state's biggest media markets and inside a practice courtroom at the law school of the University of California, Davis. To the best of anyone's recollection, it did not even air live on television. The moderator, a local television political reporter named Kevin Riggs, had sat down with three other journalists who served as panelists just that morning at a coffee shop to divide up topics.Dan Morain, who worked for The Sacramento Bee's editorial page, asked who would bring up double-dipping -- that is, taking both a public salary and a public pension. It had been an issue in the Republican primary, first raised by John Eastman, Cooley's primary opponent. Eastman is better known now for his efforts to keep Trump in office after the 2020 election, which resulted in an indictment and disbarment.""I'm going to ask that,"" replied Jack Leonard, a Los Angeles Times reporter who covered Cooley.Public pensions were a white-hot topic at the time, and Cooley was making waves for prosecuting public corruption in the city of Bell, where local officials were pulling in outlandish salaries in an impoverished municipality.Inside the practice courtroom, Leonard outlined that the $150,000 salary of the California attorney general was half of the $292,300 salary that Cooley was earning as the local district attorney. If he double-dipped by taking a taxpayer-paid pension as a former district attorney and a taxpayer-paid salary as the state attorney general, Cooley would be in line to make more than $400,000.""Do you plan to double-dip by taking both a pension and your salary as attorney general?"" Leonard asked.""Yes, I do,"" Cooley said without hesitation.He glanced at Harris. She said nothing.""I earned it.""But Cooley was not yet done. ""I definitely earned whatever pension rights I have, and I will certainly rely upon that to supplement the very low, incredibly low salary that's paid to the attorney general,"" he added.""It was tone-deaf,"" Riggs said. ""It was startling,"" Leonard said. ""It was awful,"" Morain said. ""It was jaw-dropping,"" Smith said.And it was, Cooley recalled in a recent interview, truthful.""The point is I answered honestly,"" Cooley said. ""It was a mistake. A lot of people said, 'You should have dodged that one, Steve.'""Kevin Spillane, Cooley's top strategist, blamed himself for not coaching Cooley to evade better. ""That's a credit to his character,"" Spillane said of his client's honesty. ""But that's a liability in politics.""For her part, Harris had stood in silence. Morain, who has since written a book about Harris' career, called it her ""Vin Scully moment,"" likening it to how the famous baseball broadcaster often let the sound of the game speak for itself.""Anything you'd like to add to that?"" Riggs offered.""Go for it, Steve!"" Harris said during the debate, letting loose her now familiar laugh. ""You earned it!""It was all over in less than a minute. The good news for Cooley was that practically no one had seen his answer. The bad news was that was about to change.Brian Brokaw, Harris' campaign manager, was sitting next to Smith, the chief strategist, at the debate site. ""We looked at each other,"" Brokaw said, ""and it's sometimes hard to tell in a room how something lands, and we said to each other, 'That was pretty bad, right?'""They agreed it was bad. They soon called the campaign's admaker, Mark Putnam, and told him to watch a video of the debate.There is some disagreement as to what exactly came next.""I called up Mark Putnam,"" Smith said, ""and I said, 'I think we just won the race. Can you get this in an ad?'""Putnam said he was asked to watch the debate to produce some social-media content and was floored with what he saw -- and that he was the one who told the team, ""We just won the campaign.""What both Putnam and Smith remembered is that -- to the admaker's delight -- Cooley's answer fit almost perfectly into a 30-second spot.""I looked at it and realized I didn't have to do any editing,"" Putnam said. Within a day, he cut an ad that was as bare-bones as it was devastating: just Leonard's question, Cooley's answer and quiz-show music. At the end, the screen faded to black with white text that read, ""$150,000 a year isn't enough?""The average California household earned $54,280 at the time.Putnam said there had been ""real reluctance"" to air the ad inside the campaign without having tested the message in a poll. ""It's important to know this ad almost didn't get made and almost didn't air,"" Putnam said. Smith called that nonsense. ""We didn't have money to test anything,"" he said, ""and we needed to take decisive action.""It was certainly true that the campaign was all but broke. The mid-October financial report revealed less than $850,000 in the bank -- and more than $100,000 in debts. That was not enough for a single week of television time statewide.So they decided to plow practically every last dollar into airing the double-dipping ad exclusively in Los Angeles -- hoping to cut into Cooley's home turf. They did not have enough cash to book the final three weeks all at once. ""We were spending it as it came in,"" Brokaw said.Still, the ad felt like it was ""everywhere,"" said Leonard, who stopped watching television with his wife to avoid his ""nasally British accent"" asking the double-dipping question.For her part, Harris had dreamed of closing the campaign on a high note, with advertising about her record or her vision. But they did not have enough money to do both.She ultimately greenlit the all-negative recommendation. ""This is eternally to Kamala Harris' credit,"" Smith said. ""She literally bought into shoving all the chips into the middle of the table. You will rarely find a candidate able to make that gutsy of a decision.""Around the same time, national Republicans, who foresaw the long-term threat Harris could pose, began a last-minute counterstrike against her -- a $1 million ad buy in Los Angeles that featured the brutal testimonial of the mother of a slain police officer in San Francisco who criticized Harris for refusing to seek the death penalty for the gang member who killed her son.Smith, the Harris strategist, surmised they were trying ""to kill Hercules in the crib.""He was right.""This was an intentional targeting of someone who was clearly a rising star,"" said Jankowski, who led the Republican State Leadership Committee at the time. ""That's the way we were thinking, and back then donors were buying it.""Harris had a cavalry of her own: a late-October visit from President Barack Obama for a Los Angeles rally. Obama was confronting congressional losses nationwide but still prioritized a splashy California event that featured Harris, who had been one of his earliest endorsers in 2008.""I want everybody to do right by her,"" Obama told a crowd of 37,000.Beyond the blitz of ads about his double-dipping, Cooley faced the collapse of the Republican ticket around him, led by Meg Whitman, the party's candidate for governor. Cooley recalled that he was leading 10 days out but that his team warned him of a coming Democratic surge.""The polling was just going south,"" said Spillane, the top Cooley strategist.The race was still a nail-biter on election night. Cooley jumped out to an early lead and, against Spillane's advice, declared victory. The San Francisco Chronicle followed suit, publishing a ""Cooley beats Harris"" story. A printout still hangs on Smith's office wall.At her party, Harris and her supporters huddled over laptops, tracking increasingly favorable returns deep into the night. ""People are falling asleep all around her, and she's still there,"" recalled Matt Haney, now an assembly member who worked as a campaign volunteer. ""We stayed there until the sun came out.""The later results in Los Angeles tilted ever more toward Harris, which Smith said had ""etched into the historic record"" the impact of her late advertising blitz.An internal Harris poll from early August had shown Cooley ahead by 10 percentage points in Los Angeles County. The final result: Harris carried the county by 14 points.""The ads were very effective,"" Cooley conceded. He still blamed Whitman's collapse for his defeat more than ""some clever ad,"" sounding sore about Harris and her qualifications.Harris ultimately won by less than 75,000 votes, and Cooley conceded to her three weeks after the election. No Republican has since come as close to winning statewide.""It's hard to go back and say she definitely wouldn't have won without that moment,"" Putnam said of the double-dipping episode. ""I can't play God. But the moment was decisive.""A few months after the race, Cooley called up Leonard and invited him to a meal at the Water Grill in downtown Los Angeles.

The statement was not about GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump but about his rival vice president Kamala Harris. He used Jeffrey Epstein as an analogy to explain 'Kamala Harris' ineffectiveness' in controlling inflation.“Giving Kamala Harris control over inflation policy, Shannon.It’s like giving Jeffrey Epstein control over human trafficking policy,” Vance said. ""The American people are much smarter than that. They don’t buy the idea that Kamala Harris represents a fresh start,"" the writer of bestselling Hillbilly Elegy said.“She is more of the same.

Roe V. Wade: Kamala Coronation: Free abortions and vasectomies at Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-coronation-free-abortions-and-vasectomies-at-democratic-national-convention-dnc-in-chicago/articleshow/112612022.cms,"10 things

to know before DNC:

In the past few weeks, Democrats in the U.S. have seen significant developments, starting with Joe Biden ’s decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race. Biden’s withdrawal was motivated by concerns about his age and his ability to defeat Donald Trump, the Republican challenger and former president. Kamala Harris, Biden’s Vice President, has since emerged as the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate, gaining widespread support from party members and Congress. Harris chose Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her vice-presidential running mate, which energized the party and led to a surge in donations. The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to take place in Chicago from August 19 to 22, aiming to unify the party behind the Harris-Walz ticket ahead of the election. Although Harris and Walz have already been confirmed as the candidates, the convention will include a ceremonial roll-call vote to celebrate the ticket. Joe Biden is expected to be the keynote speaker on the first night of the convention, endorsing Harris and setting the tone for the event. Both Harris and Walz will deliver speeches during the convention, with Harris closing the event on August 22. The convention will also see protests, particularly regarding Harris's stance on Israel and Gaza, with demonstrators planning marches outside the event. The protests are expected to draw large crowds, particularly from Chicago’s significant Palestinian American community, echoing the city's history of politically charged demonstrations during conventions.

Planned Parenthood is set to offer more than just promotional items at the upcoming Democratic National Convention (DNC). The organization announced that it will provide free vasectomies, medication abortions, and emergency contraception during the event.Planned Parenthood Great Rivers of St. Louis shared on X (formerly Twitter) that their mobile health clinic will be in Chicago's West Loop on August 19-20, partnering with the Chicago Abortion Fund and The Wiener's Circle to offer these services.The post highlighted that no appointment is necessary for emergency contraception, and there is already a waiting list for free vasectomies during the convention.Abortion has become a central issue in the Democrats' election campaigns, with warnings that Republican control of Congress and another term for former President Trump could lead to a nationwide abortion ban. Since the reversal of Roe v. Wade and the emergence of Vice President Kamala Harris as a leading voice, the Democratic Party has intensified its focus on protecting a woman's right to choose.A Quinnipiac University poll from April revealed that 66% of Americans support legal abortion in some or all cases, the highest level of support recorded by the poll in its 20-year history. With abortion set to be a major theme in the upcoming elections, Trump has moderated his stance, reflecting a more nuanced approach in the Republican Party platform. While the platform still opposes late-term abortion, it no longer calls for a federal abortion ban, instead emphasizing support for prenatal care, birth control access, and fertility treatments.",The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to take place in Chicago from August 19 to 22. Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz have been confirmed as the party's presidential candidates.

Pakistani minister says more arrests expected in retired ISI chief's court-martial case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-minister-says-more-arrests-expected-in-retired-isi-chiefs-court-martial-case/articleshow/112564172.cms,"LAHORE: More arrests will be made in connection with the court martial of former ISI chief General (Retd) Faiz Hameed in a housing scam, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said on Friday, a day after three more retired military officers were arrested in the case. Hameed, who served as director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) from 2019 to 2021, was arrested following action in the complaint of a private property developer over alleged misuse of official authority.""Investigations are underway in the Faiz case. More arrests are likely in the army and elsewhere,"" Dawn News quoted the minister as saying here.""It seems the ambit will not just remain limited to the military but whoever is involved and whoever has compromised the country's security… all those will come in its grasp,"" Tarar said.The minister's remarks came hours after the ISPR, the military's public affairs division, in a statement on Thursday said: ""In connection with the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) proceedings of Lt Gen (Retd) Faiz Hameed, three retired officers are also in military custody for their actions prejudicial to military discipline.""The ISPR said more retired officers and their associates were being probed for allegedly inciting instability in collaboration with and on behalf of a political entity with vested interests.The ISPR did not release the names or ranks of the officers arrested and did not indicate when the arrests had been made, but media reports claimed they were identified as Brigadier (Retd) Ghaffar, a former deputy director general for projects at ISI; Brig (Retd) Naeem Fakhar, a former officer commanding; and Colonel (Retd) Asim.Welcoming the fresh arrests in connection with the court martial proceedings against Gen Faiz for his alleged involvement in the case, Tarar said the institution of the army had prioritised self-accountability.""We think this act of self-accountability is positive and that it is a step that needs to be lauded, moving towards accountability and discord in the country being stopped.""Tarar said when a no-confidence motion was tabled against ex-prime minister Imran Khan, Gen Faiz was in contact with him. ""[Even] after going to jail Imran Khan remained in touch with Gen Faiz,"" he alleged.Taking note of the ISPR statement, Tarar regretted that discord and instability were being spread. Attempts were being made to impose an uncertain situation in the country and there were security attacks.""I think it is a very good and timely decision of the military to arrest Gen Hameed and the subsequent three officers,"" he said, adding that jailed former premier Khan was trying to dissociate himself from Gen Faiz Hameed but ""won't be able to save his neck"".The ISPR announcement follows speculation that numerous retired officers had been detained about Gen Hameed's trial for his post-retirement actions that violated the Army Act and on the complaint of the owner of a housing society in Islamabad, which had been referred to the Defence Ministry by the Supreme Court.Hameed was arrested on August 8 after being summoned to Rawalpindi by a senior army officer, with his detention only being publicly confirmed on the following Monday.His trial is being described as one of the most high-profile court martials in the history of the Pakistan Army.The unprecedented arrest of the top-ranking officer, who led the premier intelligence agency, broke the myth in the country that such powerful officers were beyond the reach of law.Lt Gen (retd.) Hameed was considered extremely powerful when he headed the spy agency from 2019 to 2021.He was appointed to the coveted post when then ISI chief and current Army chief Lt Gen Asim Munir was prematurely removed from the post. It was reported then that Khan was not happy with Munir.Later, the army decided to replace Hameed, a move vehemently opposed by Khan. It is believed that it was the beginning of the souring of his ties with the powerful military.Hameed took premature retirement in November 2022, four months before his retirement date after the current army chief took over. He was considered close to then Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa.The post of ISI chief is considered one of the most important in the Pakistan Army, which has ruled the country for more than half of its 76-plus years of existence and has wielded considerable power in security and foreign policy matters.","More arrests will be made in connection with the court martial of former ISI chief General (Retd) Faiz Hameed.
