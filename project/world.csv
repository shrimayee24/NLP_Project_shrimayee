24-year old-man arrested for sending threat messages to actor Salman Khan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/24-year-old-man-arrested-for-sending-threat-messages-to-actor-salman-khan/articleshow/115224709.cms,"( With input from agency)

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Police on Tuesday arrested a 24- year-old man for sending threat messages to Bollywood actor Salman Khan , according to news agency PTI. This arrest follows a series of threatening messages received by the actor in recent weeks.Last Thursday, Bollywood star Salman Khan received a death threat from the Lawrence Bishnoi gang , delivered via a message sent to the Mumbai Traffic Control Room in Worli. The message referenced the songwriter of ""Main Sikandar Houn"" and demanded a ransom of Rs 5 crore from Khan, allegedly on behalf of the gang.Previously, on October 24, Mumbai Police had apprehended a man in Jamshedpur for issuing threats to Salman Khan in Lawrence Bishnoi's name. Following this series of threats and an earlier shooting incident in April, Khan’s security was elevated to Y+ level.The shooting occurred on April 14 outside Salman Khan's Galaxy Apartments residence in Bandra, Mumbai. Subsequent investigations linked the incident to the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, prompting police to apply the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) to those involved.Law enforcement agencies also revealed that Lawrence Bishnoi’s brother, Anmol Bishnoi, played a key role by encouraging the attackers. Anmol reportedly delivered weapons to the shooters in Panvel on March 15, 2024, and provided them with details about the target, directing them to carry out the attack at Khan's residence.","Mumbai Police arrest a 24-year-old man for sending threat messages to Bollywood actor Salman Khan.

"Dalla shot at by own aide, reveals probe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dalla-shot-at-by-own-aide-reveals-probe/articleshow/115231411.cms,"Arsh Dalla

NEW DELHI: Confirming reports that designated terrorist Arshdeep Singh Gill, alias Arsh Dalla , was arrested in Canada following a mysterious shooting incident that left him injured in the arm, Canada’s official documents showed that a cache of arms and ammunition, including a rifle, a shotgun, a pistol and two high-capacity magazines of 15 and 35 rounds were recovered from his premises.The bizarre chain of events — which started with Dalla claiming he had been fired upon by hitmen engaged by his sworn rival Lawrence Bishnoi and ended with the cops determining that the bullet that wounded him had been fired by his own aide — has exposed Canada’s claim that it has not been sheltering criminals and terrorists, while strengthening India’s hand in the extradition of Dalla, slain Khalistan Tiger Force chief Hardeep Singh Nijjar ’s main hitman.Dalla and his associate Gurjant Singh tried to scam police by concocting a story of him being a victim of Bishnoi, a target of Khalistanis whom Canadians have blamed for the killing of Nijjar. This set off an investigation by the local police. Local cops, seemingly unaware of Dalla’s antecedents, soon found out the truth. By the time Royal Canadian Mounted Police , Canada’s federal police which ought to have been aware of India’s interest in Dalla because of his involvement in serious crimes, had been alerted, local cops had already requested his three-day remand, besides carrying out a search-and-seizure operation at his home. He was held at Oakville police station pending bail. Dalla and his aide will be produced in a local court on Wednesday.According to the case file, the duo arrived at Guelph Hospital around 4am on Oct 28. The hospital informed the police around 4.17am about a man with a gunshot wound. Dalla and Singh arrived at the hospital in a Dodge Durango SUV. They told police that while driving on Guelph Line, north of Highway 401 in Milton, Region of Halton, an unknown vehicle drew up beside their SUV and several shots were fired into their vehicle, resulting in the gunshot wound to Dalla.Dalla had a non-life threatening gunshot wound to his right bicep, which was treated by hospital staff.“...Dalla and Singh were arrested for the offence of discharging a firearm with intent. Both were cautioned, given rights to counsel, and transported to central lock-up at Oakville police station. The accused’s clothing and phones were seized by police. Both accused were held in custody pending a bail hearing. The police sought their remand for three days,” the case file said.","Arshdeep Singh Gill, alias Arsh Dalla, was arrested in Canada following a mysterious shooting incident that left him injured in the arm.

You attack me as you can’t target Razakars: Yogi to Kharge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/you-attack-me-as-you-cant-target-razakars-yogi-to-kharge/articleshow/115232884.cms,"UP CM Yogi Adityanath (File photo)

NAGPUR/AMARAVATI: Rallying voters at RSS ’ Smruti Mandir in Reshimbagh here, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath appealed to citizens to give a decisive mandate to BJP, while emphasising the symbolic and strategic importance of Nagpur for BJP and the Sangh. Adityanath urged people to secure a victory strong enough to forfeit deposits of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) candidates.Launching a blistering attack on Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge , he said, “Instead of being angry with me, Kharge ji, direct your anger towards the Nizam. Under Nizam’s tyrannical rule, mothers and sisters faced widespread atrocities. You are attacking me because you can’t attack Razakars who burnt down your house and killed your family, for fear of losing votes. The Razakars burnt and killed Kharge ji’s mother, uncle and sister. Why does Congress hide this truth? Were historical injustices suppressed for vote-bank politics? Shouldn’t people know this reality now?” he asked.Using Reshimbagh as an electoral vantage point, he rallied people across the city and outskirts to vote for Chandrashekhar Bawankule (Kamptee), Pravin Datke from Nagpur Central, where RSS Bhavan is situated, and Mohan Mate for Nagpur South. Adityanath praised the “double-engine” BJP govt, referring to the alliance between the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the Centre and Mahayuti govt in Maharashtra, as a partnership that benefits the state and nation. Highlighting the state’s historical legacy, he praised Maharashtra’s contribution to the nation, referencing figures like Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, who gave India a unified identity. The UP CM further invoked Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, stating Maharashtra and Nagpur are lands with deep national significance, adding “Who in India would not honour these figures with gratitude?”Earlier, addressing a crowded rally at Achalpur in Amravati district, he warned against division of Hindu votes. Reflecting upon the Lok Sabha loss in Amravati, he said this harmed Hindu pride and urging voters to support Mahayuti candidates Pravin Tayade (Achalpur), Kewalram Kale (Melghat), and Umesh Yawalkar (Morshi). “If Hindu votes split again, the community will once again face humiliation,” he cautioned, adding that a united vote would uphold Hindu dignity across Maharashtra.Criticizing MVA as a ‘Mahaanadi’ or ‘illiterate’ alliance, Adityanath accused it of turning Maharashtra into a “laboratory for dividing Hindu votes” and warned of cultural disruption that could impact the future of Hinduism. “A clear mandate for Mahayuti is essential to preserving Maharashtra’s legacy as a land of unity and pride for Hindus,” he said.In Nagpur, Adityanath turned his attention to national security and Congress’ alleged failures, claiming India became safer under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership. “Before 2014, Pakistan would launch terror attacks here. Today, this new India knows how to protect its borders and deal with terrorism, especially in Kashmir,” he said.He criticised Congress' approach to national security and accused them of compromising for political gain. “They compromised the security of the country for vote-bank politics. It didn’t want to scrap Article 370 because it wanted to secure votes in Kashmir rather than uphold Dr Ambedkar’s vision for India,” he argued.Referencing the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, Adityanath said, “After 500 years, Ram Lala’s presence in Ayodhya is a reality. Congress even questioned the existence of Ram and Krishna.”","Yogi Adityanath urged people to secure a victory strong enough to forfeit deposits of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) candidates.

SRINAGAR: Nine daysafter being injured in a blast from a grenade hurled by terrorists in a buzzing roadside Sunday flea market in Srinagar, a 45-year-old woman succumbed Tuesday to her wounds in a hospital here.Bandipora’s Abida was among the swarming throngs at the market near the heavily fortified Tourist Reception Centre (TRC) in central Srinagar, shopping for winter clothes for her three kids when the attack took place on Nov 3, injuring her and 11 others.Three militants of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) were arrested last week for allegedly hurling the grenade towards a CRPF mobile bunker. The grenade missed the target and landed on the road abuzz with people in the market.The attack occurred a day after the killing of a Pakistani LeT commander by security forces in Srinagar and a day before the J&K assembly was scheduled to begin a five-day session. In March 2022, a grenade attack at the same spot had left two people dead and 30 wounded.Sunday’s flea market typically draws large crowds from neighbouring districts for its affordable household items and winter clothing, making it a soft target for such attacks.Back in Naidkhai area of Bandipora’s Sumbal, home to Abida and husband Zubair Ahmad Lone, everyone’s eyes were moist Tuesday looking at their three children: a six-year-old daughter and two sons, one seven and the other five.“Why are so many people coming to our house,” the seven-year-old son asked his uncle, who struggled for an answer. The kids were unaware of the tragedy that had struck the family. “My mummy has gone to the Sunday market to buy clothes for me and my younger brother and sister. She promised me a blue jacket and long boots for winter,” the son said.A little later, some relatives took the kids away from their single-storey house to spare the children the trauma of seeing their mother’s body.",Bandipora’s Abida was among the swarming throngs at the market near the heavily fortified Tourist Reception Centre.

NEW DELHI: The Kerala government on Monday suspended two IAS officers , K Gopalakrishnan and N Prasanth , for alleged breaches of conduct. According to official sources, Gopalakrishnan was suspended for creating a religion-based WhatsApp group , while disciplinary action was taken against Prasanth for reportedly criticizing a senior officer.The controversy began on October 31, when several IAS officers in the Kerala cadre were unexpectedly added to a new WhatsApp group named "" Mallu Hindu Officers ."" The group, allegedly created by K Gopalakrishnan, included only Hindu officers, prompting immediate objections. Many officers viewed the group as a breach of the secular values that government officials are expected to uphold, and the group was deleted the following day.In response, Gopalakrishnan claimed his phone had been hacked, resulting in the unauthorized formation of several WhatsApp groups using his contacts. He filed a police complaint , asserting that he had no involvement in creating the controversial group.The incident follows another high-profile controversy involving IPS officer MR Ajith Kumar, who was recently transferred from his role as ADGP (law and order). Kumar reportedly met with senior RSS leaders without the approval of Kerala’s ruling LDF government, which faced mounting pressure to act after the CPI, an LDF ally, took a strong stance on the issue. While the government has not officially confirmed this as the reason for his transfer, the timing has raised questions.“This is the first time a WhatsApp group among officers has been created based on religious lines,” a senior officer told The Times of India, speaking on condition of anonymity. Typically, WhatsApp groups among officials are based on seniority, department, or regional ties, he explained, adding that most are inactive or serve practical, administrative functions.The formation of a group with a religious angle drew the attention of state and central intelligence agencies , who were alerted by officers added to the group. Evidence provided by these officers reportedly led intelligence authorities to take the matter seriously, and an investigation is now underway.","K Gopalakrishnan was suspended for creating a religion-based WhatsApp group. disciplinary action was taken against Prasanth for reportedly criticizing a senior officer.

Trump Picks Hardliners Marco Rubio, Mike Waltz For U.S. Secy Of State & Security Chief Positions

US President-elect Donald Trump has started building his administrative team with appointments of several advisers and political associates to various positions, including the role of White House chief of staff.His initial appointments have focused on crucial policy areas, particularly immigration, which featured prominently in his campaign messaging for 2024.The anticipated administration structure is likely to differ from his previous term. In an October interview, he acknowledged that selecting ""bad, disloyal people"" was his primary error during his first tenure.Susie Wiles, aged 67, served as the principal adviser and effective campaign manager for Trump's 2024 presidential bid.Her political roots are deeply embedded in Florida's political landscape. Initially, she contributed to Ron DeSantis's successful gubernatorial campaign. Later, she played an instrumental role in Trump's victory over DeSantis during the 2024 Republican primary.As Trump's first significant appointment following his president-elect status, Wiles's selection could prove crucial for the incoming administration, given her established rapport with him. Her leadership of Trump's most structured presidential campaign among his three attempts notably earned his confidence.She distinguished herself by successfully steering Trump's direction through a unique approach. Rather than challenging his instincts directly, she gained his respect by demonstrating positive outcomes when he followed her strategic guidance.Mike Waltz, a retired Army National Guard officer, has been selected as national security adviser. The three-term Florida congressman brings experience from multiple Afghanistan tours and previous Pentagon service. He will address various international challenges, including Ukraine's armament needs, Russia-North Korea relations, Middle Eastern conflicts, and Israel's situation with Hamas and Hezbollah.Tom Homan, 62, has been designated as 'border czar'. The former US Immigration and Customs Enforcement leader under Trump's first administration will oversee an extensive deportation programme. Despite promising humane implementation, his support for previous strict border policies has drawn criticism from Democrats.Elise Stefanik, appointed as United Nations ambassador, has consistently supported Trump since his first impeachment. The 40-year-old New York representative, currently third-ranking in House leadership, gained prominence through her questioning of university presidents regarding campus antisemitism.Stephen Miller, aged 39, assumes the role of deputy chief of staff for policy. The former senior adviser and immigration hardliner currently leads America First Legal, challenging various institutions on free speech and national security matters.Lee Zeldin, aged 44, has been nominated to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. The former New York representative, whilst lacking environmental expertise, has pledged to promote American energy independence whilst maintaining environmental standards.",Trump picks hardliners Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz for U.S. Secy Of State & Security Chief positions.

As Donald Trump is picking his staff one Truth Social post a day, a lot is going on behind the scenes with his transition team adopting a very different approach this time. Everything is taking place mostly out of the public view at Mar-a-Lago where Trump and his team huddle with a coterie of players. Elon Musk was there almost every day last week but Elon is not the only one -- there are key players like Donald Trump Jr, RFK Jr, Tulsi Gabbard, Vivek Ramaswamy , Charlie Kirk and then a random assortment of advisers.“There’s a lot of different factions. There’s a lot of people calling Trump. There’s a lot of people who thought one thing was set in stone and are finding out that’s not the case, and the chessboard is going to be shuffled a lot in the coming weeks,” said one person with knowledge of the transition.According to Politico, Trump and his transition advisers are reviewing candidates from a room at Mar-a-Lago. The room has long tables and a few televisions where Trump is being shown media clips and bios of the candidates.""Trump's transition co-chairs are Lutnick and Linda McMahon, but there are Elon Musk, Vice President-elect JD Vance, Donald Trump Jr, Tulsi Gabbard, Kennedy. There’s also a rotating cast of conservative influencers like Charlie Kirk and Vivek Ramaswamy, according to four people with knowledge of the meetings,"" Politico reported.Trump's personal friend Steve Witkoff is there and then Trump is dialing up friend and allies seeking their opinions.It was Trump Jr who shot down any discussion of Mike Pompeo or Nikki Haley for any official roles as he made it clear that his father would only take loyalists as his staff.Kirk has long been friends with Trump Jr working with him during the 2016 campaign. ""Trump called Kirk on Wednesday after his victory. And in the last week Kirk weighed in publicly in favor of two of Trump’s staffing picks before they were announced: Wiles for chief of staff and Stephen Miller for deputy chief of staff,"" the Politico report said.White House Chief of Staff: Susie WilesDeputy chief of staff for policy: Stephen MillerBorder Czar: Tom HomanNational security adviser: Mike WaltzHomeland Security secretary pick: Kristi NoemUnited National Ambassador: Elise StefanikEnvironmental Protection Agency director: Lee ZeldinSecretary of State: Marco RubioAmbassador to Israel: Mike Huckabee.","Donald Trump Jr. shot down any discussion of Mike Pompeo or Nikki Haley for any official roles as he made it clear that his father would only take loyalists as his staff.

Donald Trump Jr who on several occasions claimed that celebrities were endorsing Kamala Harris because they did not want to be dragged to the Diddy case Tuesday hinted that his father's administration will not be soft on the issue. P Diddy was arrested in September on charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation for prostitution. Diddy did not plead guilty and will now face trial next year. Hollywood A-listers were regulars at Diddy parties and Donald Trump Jr earlier drew a link between Diddy party-goers and Kamala Harris endorsers -- they're the same, he said.Reacting to a report on minors being present at Diddy's infamous 'Freak-off', Donald Trump Jr said, ""We want the whole list of who was there. Sunlight is the best disinfectant!!"".The report quoted Tanea Wallace, an aspiring singer-songwriter who claimed she went to Diddy's Freak-Off in 2018. “I was at one of, I believe to be, one of P. Diddy’s ‘Freak-Offs.’ 2018 I went to this ‘Freak-Off,'” she said to Page Six. “I look to the right of me, and in the corner, I’m looking like, ‘Are those midgets?’ Because people were over them … it’s people trying to hide what they’re doing. They’re all huddled up,” she added.“So I’m like, ‘What is that?’ But no, they weren’t [midgets]. They were little people … I don’t want to say too much. They were little people. So, use your common sense.”Wallace said the “little people” were “dressed up like little Harajuku Barbies” and wearing “red lipstick, looking, like, real sexy” and “revealing.”Several people claimed that they were raped by Diddy when they were minors but this is the first time a Freak Off-attendee claimed to have seen minors at Freak-offs.Freak offs were Diddy's infamous after-parties where women were forced to have sex with prostitutes on the camera and it went on for days sometimes with Diddy taking part in it.","P Diddy was arrested in September on charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation for prostitution.

Tens of thousands of university students embarked on nighttime bicycle journeys seeking soup dumplings , creating an unexpected social phenomenon that later faced restrictions from authorities due to its overwhelming popularity in central China's Kaifeng city.The movement gained momentum on Chinese social media after four female university students from Zhengzhou travelled to Kaifeng to sample its renowned ""tangbao."" Their journey inspired thousands of students to participate in similar adventures.Students hired shared bicycles and travelled in groups during nighttime from Zhengzhou to Kaifeng. The 40-mile journey along the Yellow River attracted numerous participants, united by the motto ""youth is priceless.""The massive gathering moved at a slow pace, with some participants displaying the Chinese flag whilst others rested in parks upon reaching Kaifeng, as evidenced by shared photographs and videos.Ji Pengbo, a 19-year-old engineering student, participated in the Friday night ride after discovering it on Douyin. The event's slogan particularly motivated his participation, as he and his friends sought to experience the excitement firsthand, reported NBC News.Ji described encountering numerous fellow university students, supportive police officers, and volunteers offering water during the journey. He shared his experience of riding in the evening atmosphere, surrounded by the collective enthusiasm of fellow cyclists.However, authorities implemented restrictions by Saturday afternoon. The Henan police closed nonmotorised lanes between the cities until Sunday noon, citing safety issues.Subsequently, China's primary bike-sharing services - Hellobike, DiDi Bike, and Mobike - issued warnings against riding beyond designated areas, implementing automatic locks and additional charges for violations.Initially, local tourism authorities embraced the trend. Kaifeng's tourism bureau celebrated the phenomenon, offering various incentives including free admission to attractions and annual passes for cycling visitors.The authorities' stance later shifted towards criticism. China Comment , a Communist Party magazine, emphasised the societal costs of such activities, advocating for responsible freedom through self-discipline.Hongsheng Zhu, from Lingnan University, Hong Kong, attributes the phenomenon's national prominence to social media algorithms and mainstream media coverage.","Students hired shared bicycles and travelled in groups during nighttime from Zhengzhou to Kaifeng.

The Khalistan Movement and Escalating Tensions



After the death of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June last year, Inderjeet Gosal became the main Canadian organiser for Sikhs for Justice (SFJ). The 35-year-old has recently been arrested by Canadian police in connection with a violent incident at a Hindu temple in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).Considered to be the right-hand man of SFJ general counsel Gurpatwant Pannun , Gosal was released on conditions by Peel Regional Police (PRP) and is set to appear in Ontario Court in Brampton.The incident, which took place at Brampton’s Hindu Sabha Mandir on 3 November, saw Khalistani activists allegedly attacking Hindu-Canadian worshippers. According to PRP, what began as a demonstration involving flags and banners quickly escalated into physical assaults.At the heart of this conflict is Gosal, a coordinator for the banned SFJ group, which campaigns for a Khalistan referendum . Authorities have confirmed that Gosal faces charges related to the attack on the temple.Inderjeet Gosal took over from Hardeep Singh Nijjar as the primary organiser for SFJ in Canada following Nijjar’s death in British Columbia in June 2023. He is known to be a close associate of SFJ’s general counsel, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, whom India designates as a terrorist.Canadian authorities previously issued a ""duty to warn"" notice to Gosal, listing him among 13 Canadians identified as potential targets of violence against pro-Khalistan activists, with support from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.SFJ alleges that Gosal was targeted himself during a pro-Khalistan protest at the Hindu temple in Brampton, which was hosting a consular camp attended by Indian consulate officials from Toronto.Gosal said last month that he was prepared to sacrifice his life for an independent Sikh homeland in Punjab, saying, “I know what I signed up for, death doesn’t scare me,” as reported by The Financial Times.The demand for a Sikh state, Khalistan, traces back to the independence movement, later intensified by anti-Sikh violence following the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Gosal and his supporters describe these events as “genocide,” which they claim forced many Sikhs to flee to Canada.The recent attack on the Hindu temple in Brampton has further strained diplomatic relations between New Delhi and Ottawa. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other leaders condemned the violence, with MP Chandra Arya criticising Canada’s leaders for failing to protect the Hindu community.The Indian High Commission in Canada also condemned the ""violent disruption"" by anti-India activists outside the consular camp.",Inderjeet Gosal is the main Canadian organiser for Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) The 35-year-old has been arrested by Canadian police in connection with a violent incident at a Hindu temple in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) Gosal was released on conditions by Peel Regional Police and is set to appear in Ontario Court in Brampton.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115144208,imgsize-2218707,width-400,resizemode-4/115144208.jpg"

The Shia conservative dominated Iraq's parliament has proposed an amendment to the country's ""personal status law,"" which could lead to a major setback of women's rights, much like the policies seen under Taliban.Critics argued that this law would strip women of all decisions.Raya Faiq, who is challenging the bill with Iraqi representatives, said that this law would allow young girls to be married off early and transfers almost all family decisions in the hands of religious authorities.“This is a catastrophe for women,” Faiq told The Guardian, adding that this law would legalize child rape.Decades of sectarian conflict have resulted in a government dominated by the Shia Muslim religious majority, which has also attempted to amend the personal status law twice before. However, both efforts were greeted with strong opposition from Iraqi women, as per the New York Post.However, with religious groups holding a strong majority in Parliament at present, Faiq and 25 female representatives face a tough challenge in blocking a second vote that could approve the bill.“Unfortunately, male MPs who support this law speak in a masculine way, asking, ‘What’s wrong with marrying a minor?’ Their thinking is narrow minded,” an Iraqi representative said.In case the law passes, it would also remove women’s rights to divorce, child custody and inheritance. The Shia coalition has consistently argued that the law aims to protect girls from what they describe as ""immoral relationships.""Opponents of the law and human rights groups, however, have condemned the bill as an effort to undermine women's rights in the country, especially after recent protests led by young women against the strict government.They argue that the bill puts young girls at greater risk of sexual and physical violence, and could also make it easier for them to be taken out of school, depriving them of an education.Even though child marriages have been long banned in the 1950s, a 2023 United Nations survey found that around 28 per cent of girls in Iraq were married before turning 18.","Iraq is on the verge of passing a new law that would permit men to marry young girls, by lowering the legal age of consent from 18 to 9.

2016 presidential campaign and shift to populism

Foreign policy

An American Son

American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone

US President-elect Donald Trump according to NYT has chosen Republican Senator Marco Rubio as his pick for Secretary of State , positioning Rubio to become the first Latino to serve in America's top diplomatic role.Born in Miami, Florida, on May 28, 1971, Rubio has earned a reputation as a conservative leader, particularly on foreign policy issues. He is known for his hawkish stance on countries like China, Iran, and Cuba. Rubio’s selection is seen as an effort by Trump to diversify his administration's leadership, potentially strengthening his appeal among Latino voters , a demographic that has traditionally leaned Democratic but shifted in Trump's favour during the recent election.While Rubio has been a vocal advocate for a strong US presence on the world stage, he has, in recent years, adjusted some of his positions to align with Trump’s approach of restraint.Rubio’s parents emigrated from Cuba in 1956, settling first in Miami and later in Las Vegas, where his father worked as a bartender and his mother as a hotel housekeeper. Although raised Catholic, Rubio was briefly baptized as a Mormon before returning to his Catholic roots. The family returned to Florida in 1985, where Rubio graduated from the University of Florida in 1993 before earning a law degree from the University of Miami.Rubio’s political career began early. He worked for Republican Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen before serving on the West Miami City Commission. In 1999, he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives, where he served until 2008, including stints as majority leader and speaker.In 2009, Rubio launched his campaign for the US Senate seat left vacant by Mel Martinez’s resignation. Initially trailing Florida Governor Charlie Crist, Rubio’s fortunes changed when Crist broke from the Republican Party and declared himself an independent. Rubio won the 2010 election by a significant margin in a three-way race.Once in the Senate, Rubio aligned himself with the conservative wing of the Republican Party. He opposed key Democratic initiatives such as gun control, the Affordable Care Act, and climate-change legislation. Despite this, he broke with many in his party when he co-authored a 2013 immigration reform bill that sought to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. The bill ultimately failed to pass.Rubio also became known for his foreign policy views, particularly his opposition to the Obama administration's attempts to normalize relations with Cuba. His foreign policy stance has often reflected an interventionist approach, particularly regarding China and the Middle East.Rubio’s 2016 presidential campaign was initially seen as a strong challenge to Donald Trump. He positioned himself as a candidate who could unite the Republican Party establishment but struggled against Trump’s dominance in the race. After a brutal series of defeats, Rubio suspended his campaign after losing the Florida primary.Following his return to the Senate, Rubio began to embrace more populist conservative views, aligning more closely with Trump’s America First agenda. He became a vocal supporter of Trump and developed a strong working relationship with him. Although Rubio initially backed efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, he ultimately voted to certify Joe Biden’s victory after the January 6 Capitol attack.Rubio’s foreign policy views align with Trump on many fronts, though there are some key differences. Both have been critical of Nato, with Rubio co-sponsoring legislation that would make it more difficult for a president to withdraw from the alliance without Senate approval. Rubio is also a staunch critic of China, pushing for greater scrutiny of Chinese investments in US technology and advocating for a hardline approach on issues like Huawei’s influence.One of Rubio’s most personal stances is his opposition to normalizing relations with Cuba, a policy he shares with Trump. He is also a vocal critic of the Maduro regime in Venezuela, reflecting his deep personal connection to the island through his Cuban-American heritage.Rubio is married to Jeanette Dousdebes, whom he met as a teenager, and they have four children. He has authored two books:(2012), a memoir about his upbringing, and(2015), which outlines his policy views.","Donald Trump has chosen Republican Senator Marco Rubio as his pick for Secretary of State.

Reports claimed there was a scheduling conflict as Melania has some other programs already scheduled at that time but the New York Post cited sources claiming that Melania does not like the Bidens after Joe Biden authorized the FBI raid at Mar-a-Lago as part of the government's investigation into classified documents -- where the officials even went through her underwear drawer.

Traditionally, the outgoing first lady hosts the incoming one for tea in the White House. When Melania became the first lady for the first time after Trump's 2016 election win, she was received at the White Hoise by Michelle Obama. But in 2020 after Trump lost the election, they broke the decades-long tradition by not inviting the Bidens.Trump's chief of staff to-be Susie Wiles who was also his campaign manager was in touch with Biden's chief of staff Jeff Zients this week regarding coordinating the meeting. Biden spoke with Trump Wednesday, a day after the election, to congratulate him on his win and invited him to the White House. Trump said he and Biden agreed to have lunch together ""very shortly"" when they spoke by phone.Melania's rejection of the first invite from Dr Jill Biden even before Melania became the First Lady hints at a difficult term she will lead as the First Lady for the second term.

Taiwan's ministry of national defence (MND) reported increased Chinese military activity near its territory on Wednesday, detecting 24 People's Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft and 6 People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) vessels operating around the island.Of the aircraft identified, 15 crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait and entered Taiwan's northern, central southwestern, and eastern Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ).The MND confirmed that it closely monitored the situation and took necessary responsive actions, issuing a statement on X (formerly Twitter).This escalation follows a similar incident on Tuesday when Taiwan's defence ministry detected 10 Chinese aircraft and 5 naval vessels near the island. Out of these, 8 aircraft crossed the median line, also breaching Taiwan's ADIZ. The MND reiterated that they were monitoring these movements and responding appropriately.China has significantly ramped up its military presence around Taiwan since September 2020, frequently deploying aircraft and naval vessels in a show of force. These actions are part of what analysts describe as ""grey zone tactics,"" aimed at gradually wearing down Taiwan’s defences and testing its military response without engaging in open conflict.In response to these provocations, Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te recently convened a high-level national security meeting. He reassured the Taiwanese public of the government's commitment to safeguarding the nation's democracy and security amid rising tensions.The conference followed China's announcement of large-scale military exercises named "" Joint Sword-2024B ,"" conducted in the Taiwan Strait. The drills, according to Chinese state media, serve as a stern warning to those advocating for Taiwan's independence.To strengthen its defence capabilities, Taiwan is actively modernising its military infrastructure. On November 4, President Lai Ching-te attended a keel-laying ceremony at the Kaohsiung shipyard for the Republic of China Navy's (ROCN) new light frigate prototype.This development is part of Taiwan's broader strategy to bolster its naval strength and enhance its defensive capabilities in the face of growing military pressure from Beijing.","Taiwan's ministry of national defence (MND) reported increased Chinese military activity near its territory on Wednesday.

Trump will also reach into the the Senate, with the expected appointment of Marco Rubio of Florida as secretary of state, according to a person familiar with the matter.The loss of two Republicans will tighten margins conside rably for Johnson, who only took the speaker’s gavel after former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted following a prolonged leadership battle among Republicans that paralysed the chamber. And while Republicans may be favoured to win back the empty seats, the slots will remain vacant until filled in a special election.With 218 seats needed to control the 435-member House, Republicans Monday were leading in races that have been decided, 214-205, according to AP. Democrats are leading in many of the 17 uncalled races, but the GOP was strongly favored to ultimately take the majority.In the Senate, Republicans have already secured a majority, and Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, would choose Rubio’s successor if he’s formally nominated and confirmed by the Senate.","Trump has selected Mike Waltz, a Florida congressman, to serve as his national security advisor.

China pushing to deploy its own security staff to protect citizens in Pak: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-pushing-to-deploy-its-own-security-staff-to-protect-citizens-in-pak-report/articleshow/115235966.cms,"File photo

Beijing is pushing Pakistan to allow its own security staff to provide protection to thousands of Chinese citizens working in the South Asian nation, during talks after a car bombing in Karachi that was seen as a major security breach, sources said.Last month’s airport bombing in the southern port city that killed two Chinese engineers returning to work on a project after a holiday in Thailand was the latest in a string of attacks on Beijing’s interests in Pakistan. The attacks, and Islamabad’s failure to deter them, have angered China, which has pushed Pakistan to begin formal negotiations for a joint security management system .Reuters spoke to five Pakistani security and govt sources with direct knowledge of the previously unreported negotiations, and reviewed a written proposal sent by Beijing to Islamabad. “They (Chinese) want to bring in their own security,” said one official, who sat in on a recent meeting, adding that Pa kistan had not so far agreed to such a step.A written proposal sent to Islamabad by Beijing, and forwarded to Pakistani security agencies for review, mentioned a clause allowing the dispatching of security agencies and military forces into each others’ territory to assist in counter-terrorism missions and conduct joint strikes. The dispatching would be done after discussions, but Pakistani agencies were averse to the proposal, one official said.Neither Beijing nor Islama bad confirmed the talks officially. The source, and two other officials, said there was a consensus on setting up a joint security management system, and that Pakistan was amenable to Chinese officials sitting in on security meetings and co-ordination. But there was no agreement on their participating in security arrangements on the ground. The first official said Pakistan had asked China for help in improving its intelligence and surveillance capabilities instead of direct involvement.The nature of the Karachi bombing has angered Beijing: A pick-up truck rigged with nearly 100 kg of explosives waited unchecked for 40 minutes near the outermost security cordon of the heavily guarded airport before its driver rammed it into the vehicle carrying Chinese engineers, officials said. “It was agrave security breach,” admitted one of the officials investigating the blast. Investigators believe the attackers had “inside help” in securing details of the itinerary and route.","Beijing is pushing Pakistan to allow its own security staff to provide protection to thousands of Chinese citizens working in the South Asian nation.

This move was condemned by Democrats who called it a partisan tactic.Before his role in intelligence, Ratcliffe served as a congressman starting in 2014. He gained attention as a strong supporter of Trump, especially during the first impeachment proceedings. Ratcliffe called the proceedings ""the thinnest, fastest and weakest impeachment our country has ever seen,"" following the House's vote to impeach Trump.Ratcliffe's initial nomination for Director of National Intelligence in 2019 faced challenges. He withdrew after only five days amidst questions regarding his experience and qualifications.

Judge delays decision on Trump’s conviction dismissal amid presidential immunity debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-delays-decision-on-trumps-conviction-dismissal-amid-presidential-immunity-debate/articleshow/115226304.cms,"Donald Trump

Legal and public reactions

“Severe blow” to accountability

The judge presiding over Donald Trump’s New York criminal case has postponed a crucial decision on whether to dismiss the former president-elect’s conviction until November 19. Trump’s legal team is seeking dismissal based on a recent Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, arguing it shields Trump from prosecution for official acts committed during his presidency. The court’s conservative majority ruled 6-3, affirming broad immunity for presidents, a decision Trump’s attorneys swiftly invoked.The charges stem from Trump’s May conviction on 34 felony counts, with a jury finding he had falsified business records to conceal an alleged affair with a porn star before the 2016 election. He is scheduled for sentencing on November 26, unless Judge Juan Merchan dismisses the case based on the new immunity precedent.“The joint application for a stay of the current deadlines... until November 19, is granted,” read an email from the court, obtained by AFP.If Merchan dismisses the case, Trump, 78, would avoid sentencing entirely. If not, Trump’s attorneys are expected to argue against any immediate sentencing, warning it could hinder Trump’s responsibilities as president-elect.Public opinion has been polarized. The Kansas City Star editorial board urged the court to consider an unprecedented move: “do what was once unthinkable—force a president-elect to take the oath of office in a jail cell.” Such a scenario, it argued, would symbolize America’s commitment to the rule of law.However, Trump’s former attorney general, Bill Barr, criticized the New York case and others nationwide as “plainly brought for political purposes.” Barr argued that any continued pursuit of these cases would “distract the country and the incoming administration from the task at hand.”Trump himself has repeatedly condemned the prosecution as a “witch hunt,” declaring it “should be rightfully terminated.” In addition to the New York case, Trump faces two federal cases—one over efforts to overturn the 2020 election, the other over alleged mishandling of classified documents. The special counsel handling both cases, Jack Smith, reportedly began winding down investigations following Trump’s election victory.Legal expert Randall Eliason expressed concern that Trump’s re-election could prevent him from facing consequences. “Trump’s victory means he is unlikely to be held accountable for any of his alleged criminal misconduct,” Eliason noted in an analysis on Substack, calling it “a severe blow to the ideal of the rule of law.”Trump’s legal saga adds another twist to an already dramatic election cycle, which saw Trump survive an assassination attempt in July, while President Joe Biden withdrew from the race, leading Vice President Kamala Harris to become the Democratic nominee.","The judge presiding over Donald Trump's New York criminal case has postponed a crucial decision on whether to dismiss the former president-elect’s conviction until November 19.

'Army chief for life': How the 'establishment' is tightening its grip on elected government in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/army-chief-for-life-how-the-establishment-is-tightening-its-grip-on-elected-government-in-pakistan/articleshow/115173618.cms,"Implication of the amendment

The 'establishment'



Not the first time

More changes



The recent amendment to the Pakistan Army Act, which extends the tenure of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) from three to five years, has sparked significant debate and concern regarding the implications for civil-military relations in Pakistan .This legislative change, hastily approved by the ruling coalition led by PM Shehbaz Sharif's PML-N, not only lengthens the term of the army chief but also removes the retirement age limit for four-star generals, effectively allowing military leaders to remain in power indefinitely.The amendment allows the current COAS, General Asim Munir , who was appointed in November 2022 and was set to retire in 2025, to potentially serve until 2027 or longer if further extensions are granted. This change is seen as a continuation of a trend where military leaders have managed to extend their tenures beyond traditional limits.The amendment was moved by defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif and received majority support despite strong opposition protests from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by former PM Imran Khan.The PTI lawmakers criticised the expedited process of passing such crucial legislation without adequate debate, arguing that it undermines democratic principles in a country already grappling with political instabilityThe removal of the retirement age limit for the army chief raises critical concerns about the balance of power between civilian governance and military authority in Pakistan.Critics argue that this move consolidates military power at a time when civilian institutions are already perceived as weak. The ability for an army chief to remain in power indefinitely could lead to a scenario where military influence over political affairs becomes even more pronounced, effectively sidelining elected representatives.Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, noted that such legislative actions transform the legislative into a ""rubber stamp"", thereby diminishing democratic governance.The Pakistan army has been a dominant force in the country's political landscape since its inception in 1947, often overshadowing elected governments.The military's involvement in politics began almost immediately, with its first significant intervention occurring in 1958 when General Muhammad Ayub Khan led a coup against the civilian government, citing corruption and inefficiency.Since that initial coup, the army has directly ruled the country for about 36 years, while also exerting considerable influence during periods of civilian rule.Major coups occurred under Ayub Khan (1958), Yahya Khan (1969), and Zia-ul-Haq (1977), each time justifying military rule as necessary for national stability.The military's rationale often centered around restoring order amid political chaos, which has led to a cycle of governance where elected officials frequently find themselves subordinate to military interests.The intertwining of military and political affairs has given rise to what analysts describe as the ""establishment"" or ""deep state"", where the military operates behind the scenes to influence policy decisions even when not in direct control.This dynamic has allowed the army to maintain significant control over key areas such as foreign policy, security, and economic management. For instance, during recent political upheavals, including the ousting of former Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022, the military played a crucial role in shaping political outcomes.Elected governments have often been compelled to align their policies with military interests.Political leaders are acutely aware that their tenure could be jeopardized by military intervention if they stray too far from the army's preferences. This has led to a pattern where civilian governments consult with military leaders on critical issues, particularly those involving national security and foreign relations. The recent amendments to extend the tenure of the Chief of Army Staff reflect this ongoing power dynamic, allowing military leadership to exert even greater influence over governance without the constraints of a retirement age.In defense of the amendments, government officials have argued that extending military tenures is essential for maintaining stability and continuity in Pakistan's security leadership amid regional tensions. They contend that allowing military chiefs to serve longer terms will enable them to address national security challenges without disruptions caused by frequent leadership changes.Supporters of the amendment also claim that aligning military leadership tenures with other constitutional offices—many of which have five-year terms—provides a rational framework for governance.The legislative change is not unprecedented in Pakistan's history.Previous army chiefs have also enjoyed extended tenures through similar amendments or political maneuvering.General Qamar Javed Bajwa had his term extended multiple times during his tenure from 2016 to 2022.The pattern of extending military leadership has become almost standard practice, raising questions about accountability and oversight within Pakistan's political system.Observers note that General Munir's potential extended tenure could mirror historical figures like General Zia-ul-Haq, whose prolonged rule led to widespread discontent among both military ranks and civilians due to perceived mismanagement and authoritarian practices.The removal of age limits and potential for indefinite extensions could lead to a scenario where future army chiefs similarly consolidate power.Moreover, there are concerns that these changes may pave the way for further legal amendments aimed at consolidating military power across other branches of government.For instance, recent discussions around increasing the number of Supreme Court judges could be interpreted as an attempt to ensure favorable judicial outcomes for military interests.","The Pakistan army has been a dominant force in the country's political landscape since its inception in 1947. The army has directly ruled the country for about 36 years, while also exerting considerable influence during periods of civilian rule.

Users described difficulties connecting, with VPN Unlimited showing a peak of reported problems at around 6:15 pm and TunnelBear users noting connectivity issues into the evening.For many Pakistanis, VPNs are a vital tool for accessing blocked sites, including X (formerly Twitter), which has been restricted due to national security concerns.

In his message, Sharif wrote, ""Congratulations to President-elect Donald Trump on his historic victory for a second term! I look forward to working closely with the incoming administration to further strengthen and broaden the Pakistan-US partnership.” However, X attached a community note to the tweet, pointing out that Sharif himself had banned X in Pakistan and was likely using a VPN to access the platform, which is “unlawful under Pakistani law.”This community note intensified debates over VPN usage in the country, with some citizens arguing that restrictive internet policies compel even government officials to bypass their own regulations. Another note was attached to a subsequent tweet by Sharif, congratulating Pakistan’s cricket team.In February, X was banned in Pakistan, with authorities citing “national security concerns” and non-compliance with local laws as justification. Despite the restrictions, X remains a key platform for official statements from the government.Last August, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) announced plans to scrutinise VPN services in the country, aiming to limit access to only those services that align with government regulations.

A serious incident on GT Road near Kalashah Kako saw nine people injured when a van collided with a stationary truck, its driver unable to see the parked vehicle through the dense haze.The smog has also forced Lahore high court to mandate a shutdown of all trade activities by 8 pm and close markets on Sundays, aiming to minimize pollution-inducing activity.In Multan, conditions reached what experts called ""apocalyptic"" levels, with the AQI exceeding 2,000 on Friday morning. The concentration of PM2.5—a hazardous particulate matter known to cause severe respiratory and cardiovascular issues—was recorded at 947 micrograms per cubic meter, nearly 190 times above World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The WHO deems PM2.5 levels above five micrograms per cubic meter harmful.In response, the state government is on high alert, implementing emergency measures to curb pollution levels. Public parks and museums across major cities have been closed until at least November 17.Authorities have also faced criticism for failing to enforce preemptive anti-smog directives, with citizens often seen without masks despite the severe air quality.Multan, the largest city in southern Punjab, recorded an extremely dangerous Air Quality Index (AQI) of 2,135 between 8am and 9am on Friday, according to data from IQAir, as reported by Dawn.

At least 26 people — 14 soldiers, six railway employees and six civilian passengers — were killed and more than 60 injured in a suicide bombing at a railway station in Pakistan’s southwestern city of Quetta on Saturday. The proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), the most prominent militant group in the restive province, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying its suicide unit, the Majeed Brigade, had carried out the bombing to target a “Pakistani army unit” returning via train after completing a course at an infantry school.Authorities said the blast was a “suicide attack” primarily on law enforcement agencies, while civilians were also targeted. Forty-six among the injured were Pakistan army soldiers, police said. The explosion occurred as a popular morning train, Jaffar Express, was about to leave a station in Quetta for Peshawar in the northwest.Pakistan Railways had restored train services between Quetta and Peshawar last month after a suspension of seven weeks because separatist militants in Balochistan had blown up a key railway bridge in Aug.Social media videos captured Saturday’s explosion. The bomb went off when hundreds of people were at the platform. A video of the aftermath showed injured individuals and debris strewn throughout the station. The steel structure of the platform’s roof had been ripped apart.“The target was army personnel from the Infantry School,” said Muazzam Jah Ansari, police chief of Balochistan province.Wasim Baig, spokesperson for the provincial health department, said the death toll rose to 26 after two people succumbed to their injuries in hospital while 62 others were injured.The BLA has long waged an armed rebellion, driven by demands for independence and control over the province’s gas and mineral resources.Balochistan CM Sarfraz Bugti called the act deplorable and the perpetrators “worse than animals”. He said the authorities would pursue them and “bring them to their logical end”.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif denounced the bombing, saying those who orchestrated the attack “will pay a very heavy price for it”, adding that security forces were determined to eliminate “the menace of terrorism”.A decades-old insurgency has destabilised Balochistan and created security concerns for China-led projects trying to access the province’s untapped resources. In Aug at least 73 people were killed in Balochistan province after separatist militants attacked police stations, railway lines and highways.Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest province and the richest in terms of natural resources, but it is the least developed. The region shares a volatile border with Iran and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, and also boasts a vast coastline along the Arabian Sea.The govt’s military operation to suppress the separatist movement in the province has resulted in widespread human rights abuses against Baloch dissenters, including disappearances, torture and extrajudicial killings.","14 soldiers, six railway employees and six civilian passengers killed.
