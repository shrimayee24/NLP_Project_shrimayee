Poll What do you think is the most effective measure to combat drug trafficking? Stronger law enforcement Public awareness & education





MUMBAI: In one of the biggest drug seizures in the country this year, the Anti-Narcotics Cell and Crime Branch of the Mira-Bhayandar, Vasai-Virar police have busted a massive cartel operating through a chemical manufacturing factory in Telangana, seizing mephedrone (MD) worth an estimated Rs 12,000 crore.Mephedrone, also called “meow meow,” “meph,” “m-cat,” and “miaow,” is a synthetic stimulant belonging to the amphetamine group of drugs, which includes speed and ecstasy. According to sources, this is among the largest narcotics seizures in recent years.The probe began with the arrest of a 12 person including a foreign national and seizure of 100 grams of MD along with Rs 25 lakh in cash. Further interrogation revealed links to an interstate network engaged in large-scale production and supply of mephedrone. The investigation eventually led officers to Telangana, where the cartel was using a chemical factory as a cover for drug manufacturing.“In a bid to get to the roots of the factory, we infiltrated our men in the gang. After weeks of risky efforts, we were able to bust the cartel,” a senior officer said.The factory, located in the Cherlapally industrial area near Hyderabad and operating under the name Waghdevi Labs, appeared legitimate from the outside but was allegedly producing narcotics on a large scale.During the raid, police seized sophisticated chemical equipment, drug production units, and a massive cache of raw materials, including nearly 32,000 litres of precursor chemicals.The factory’s owner and chemical expert, Srinivas Valotty, along with associate Tanaji Pate, were taken into custody. In total, 12 persons have been arrested so far, including the foreign national caught in the initial operation.Police described the bust as a major blow to the narcotics supply chain across Maharashtra and other states. The factory has been sealed, and further raids are being conducted to trace the cartel’s wider distribution network.Commissioner of MBVV Niket Kaushik confirmed the drug seizure and said their investigation has led them to drug cartel to other states.","Mephedrone is a synthetic stimulant belonging to the amphetamine group of drugs, which includes speed and ecstasy.

MUMBAI: The Mumbai Crime Branch has arrested the man who allegedly issued a bomb threat to the city’s traffic department.

He directed the officials to supply protected drinking water in the village. He made it clear no new case should be reported hereafter.""Officials should be vigilant 24X7 as there is a high possibility for the spread of the suspected bacterial disease through drinking water, food items, and through air.Meanwhile, the state govt constituted a high-level committee, led by Director of Secondary Health (DSH) Dr A Siri, to identify the officials responsible for failing to apprise higher authorities in time about the sudden spike in deaths in Turakapalem village.The committee will also make recommendations on measures to ensure that health department officials are immediately informed in case of a large number of deaths due to any illness in any region of the state in the future.

SRINAGAR: Engineer Rashid “narrowly escaped” when a group of inmates in Tihar Jail pushed him and threw a gate at him, Awami Ittehad Party (AIP) headed by the Baramulla MP alleged in a statement.“Had it hit him directly, it could have been fatal.

S Jaishankar To Join BRICS Online Summit As Member Nations Unite Against Trump’s Tariff War

Poll Should India continue to pursue its relationship with the US despite recent trade tensions? Yes, it's important for strategic interests No, we should focus on other alliances

NEW DELHI: India will be represented in the Brics leaders' virtual summit that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will convene on Sept 8 by external affairs minister S Jaishankar, and not PM Narendra Modi. The leaders' meeting will discuss ways to deal with Trump's tariffs, along with efforts to boost multilateralism, and may be followed by a joint statement. The ministry of external affairs (MEA) said Friday that Jaishankar will join the virtual summit.Brazil is not projecting it as an anti-US summit, but Modi's decision to skip the event, even as India prepares to assume the Brics presidency next year, suggests an effort to balance out his participation in the SCO summit that was seen as a reassertion of India's strategic autonomy in the middle of a trade crisis with Washington.Launching into another rant against India for its participation in Brics, US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick said Friday India should either support the dollar and the US, or be ready to pay a 50% tariff. Ironically, within Brics, India has always emphatically rejected the idea of de-dollarisation, maintaining it's not a part of its strategy.Modi's show of camaraderie with Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on the margins of SCO summit in Tianjin also vindicated the point many have made about Trump driving India into the arms of China with his trade policy.However, as MEA reiterated Friday, India sees its relationship with the US as important and will continue to pursue the substantive agenda that both countries have committed to, hoping that the relationship will continue to move forward based on mutual respect and shared interests. India has stressed on the significance of mutual respect in the relationship, as senior Trump administration officials' launch frequently into anti-India tirades.While both Brazil and India have been slapped with 50% tariffs by the US president, in Brazil's case it's more about political vengeance than trade. Trump has targeted Brazil for the prosecution of his political ally, right-wing leader and former president Jair Bolsonaro. Trump has imposed an additional 25% tariff on India for its purchase of Russian crude. Brazil has so far not announced the names of other leaders who will join the meeting.","Brazil is not projecting it as an anti-US summit, but Modi's decision to skip the event suggests an effort to balance out his participation in the SCO summit.

New Delhi Locks Eyes With Trump After ‘Lost India’ Dig; Blasts Peter Navarro | Tariff War

Poll Should India continue its trade relations with Russia despite the ongoing conflict? Yes No

NEW DELHI: Senior White House adviser Peter Navarro on Friday renewed his attack on India, accusing New Delhi of profiteering from Russian oil and imposing tariffs that he says cost Americans their jobs.In a post on X on Friday, Navarro wrote: “FACTS: India highest tariffs costs US jobs. India buys Russian oil purely to profit/Revenues feed Russia war machine. Ukrainians/Russians die. US taxpayers shell out more. India can't handle truth/spins”His remarks came in response to a Washington Post article that said Washington’s harsh language toward New Delhi was worsening ties.Navarro has repeatedly targeted India for its refusal to halt trade with Moscow, calling the conflict “Modi’s war,” branding the country “Kremlin’s laundromat,” and alleging it was profiting from the war.Meanwhile, in an interview with Bloomberg Television last week, he had claimed: “India is helping feed the Russian war machine. I mean Modi's war, because the road to peace runs, in part, through New Delhi.”The ministry of external affairs (MEA) rejected his comments. Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said: “We have seen the inaccurate and misleading statements made by Navarro, and obviously, we reject them.”He added, “We remain focused on the substantive agenda that our two countries have committed to, and we hope that the relationship will continue to move forward based on mutual respect and shared interests.”Earlier on Friday, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said that President Donald Trump and his trade team were “disappointed” with India’s continued imports of Russian crude oil but expressed hope for “positive developments.”Trump himself has repeatedly described India as America’s “most tariffed partner,” calling the trade relationship a “totally one-sided disaster.” He argues that while India exports large volumes of goods to the US, its high tariffs restrict American companies from accessing the Indian market. A US appeals court recently ruled that several of Trump’s tariff measures were “illegal.”","Navarro has repeatedly targeted India for its refusal to halt trade with Moscow.

""These groups previously had an extensive fundraising network in Canada but now appear to consist of smaller pockets of individuals with allegiance to the cause,"" it noted.Khalistani violent extremist groups have also been known to use networks to solicit donations from diaspora communities to raise and move funds, including through non-profit organisations,"" the Canadian govt's report noted. The acknowledgment of the use of violent means is in contrast to the description of their activities as ""democratic freedoms"" earlier.The report lists BKI and ISYF, along with Hamas and Hezbollah, in the ""politically motivated violent extremism"" category who have been able to generate funds in Canada.These groups, it said, used diverse funding methods to sustain their operations, including the abuse of the money services businesses and banking sectors; use of cryptocurrencies; state financing; abuse of the charitable and NPO sector; and criminal activity.The report covers all violent groups on how they were able to sustain themselves by finding resources within Canada. Self-financing methods were observed in two prominent terrorist attacks in Canada conducted by lone actors radicalised by ideologically motivated violent extremism.It cited the 2020 incident of a 17-year-old male radicalised by the incel (involuntary celibacy) movement who killed a woman and injured another at a massage parlour in Toronto, using only a sword to conduct the attack. Another case cited was from 2021, in which four members of a Muslim family were killed when an individual drove a pickup truck onto a pedestrian crosswalk in London, Ontario. In 2024, the individual was sentenced to life imprisonment for first-degree murder and attempted murder amounting to terrorism.The report also mentions Canada's financial sector may be exposed to risks emanating from correspondent banking relationships with institutions known or suspected of servicing Hezbollah or Hamas.Cross-border networks and organised IMVE groups differ from lone actors in their financing, it noted. ""Organised groups often rely on online communities and cross-border networks to raise funds and have been observed to rely on a host of financing methods, including commercial activities, such as merchandise sales; hosting paid events, such as talks and concerts; crowdfunding; charging membership fees; and accepting donations,"" it said.

Op Sindoor Continued After May 10 as Every Decision Had Long-Term Implications, Says Army Chief

NEW DELHI: Releasing a book on Operation Sindoor , Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Friday said the India-Pakistan conflict did not end with the May 10 ceasefire understanding but “continued for a long time.”The book, ""Operation Sindoor: The Untold Story of India’s Deep Strikes Inside Pakistan"", has been authored by former army officer KJS Dhillon, a veteran.“You may be thinking that on May 10, the war finished; no, because it continued for a long time, with many decisions still to be taken. Beyond that, of course, it will be difficult for me to share here,” General Dwivedi said at the launch event, according to PTI.""India announced its resolve with a new normal, with outstanding clarity in strategic guidance, with a whole-of-nation approach for execution,"" he asserted in his address.The army chief also noted how, throughout the conflict, the force ""moved something like a rhythmic wave.""""When I say rhythmic wave, in these 88 hours, it was not possible for you to come for the planning, pass the orders... so, everybody was synergised, and everybody knew his orders,"" he explained.Hours after the ceasefire took effect on May 10, Pakistan had sent drones into Indian border states — a move it repeated the next night.On his part, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has repeatedly emphasised that Operation Sindoor has only been “paused.”It was launched on May 7 in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack , in which Pakistan-backed terrorists killed 26 civilians. Under it, the Indian forces struck multiple terror infrastructures across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in what the government described as “focused, measured and non-escalatory” action.Pakistan retaliated with offensives, prompting Indian counter-strikes, and the conflict dragged on for nearly four days.

Pune shooting: Son of jailed co-accused in Vanraj Andekar murder case shot dead; revenge angle probed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/19-year-old-son-of-jailed-co-accused-in-andekar-murder-case-gunned-down-in-punes-nana-peth/articleshow/123726192.cms,"19-year-old son of jailed co-accused in Andekar murder case gunned





PUNE: The 19-year-old son of one of the jailed co-accused in the murder of former NCP corporator Vanraj Andekar on Sept 1 last year was shot dead by two unidentified assailants in the crowded Nana Peth area around 7.45pm on Friday, causing panic and tension in the heart of the city during peak Ganeshotsav rush on the eve of immersion day.Police identified the victim as Ayush Komkar, who is the son of Ganesh Komkar, one of the 21 accused lodged in Yerawada central jail in the Andekar murder case. Ayush is also Vanraj's nephew. His father, Ganesh, is the husband of one of Vanraj's two sisters with whom the former corporator was involved in a property dispute that became one of the contributory motives behind his murder last year, the police said.The murder comes barely days after the Pune police claimed to have foiled a plot to kill the relatives of Somnath Gaikwad and Aniket Dudhbhate, the other two key accused in the Andekar murder case, at Ambegaon Pathar.Pune's joint commissioner of police, Ranjan Kumar Sharma, told TOI: ""Prima facie, revenge appears to be the motive behind the murder. However, we are examining all possible angles considering that the victim (Ayush) had no direct link with Vanraj Andekar's murder.""Sharma cited preliminary information gathered from the spot and said the victim had reached the basement parking area of an apartment building close to the Navrang Ganesh Mandal near Palkhi Vithoba Chowk after attending his tuition class.At this time, two men drove near him on a bike. ""Before anyone could understand what they were up to, the duo fired three bullets at the victim and swiftly drove away from the spot,"" he said.The body has been sent to Sassoon General Hospital, and a preliminary postmortem report is awaited. ""Eleven teams from the Samarth police and crime branch units have been formed to trace and arrest the assailants. For now, our teams are examining CCTV footage collected from various establishments in the vicinity and are recording statements of witnesses who were present around the crime scene. A forensic team is also at the spot to collect vital pieces of evidence,"" the joint CP said.Shops and establishments around the crime spot downed their shutters amid panic soon after the firing incident. ""There is no law-and-order situation as of now and the situation is under control,"" additional commissioner of police (East region) Rajesh Bansode told TOI.City police commissioner Amitesh Kumar, additional commissioner of police (crime) Pankaj Deshmukh, DCPs Krushikesh Rawale and Nikhil Pingale along with Sharma aand Bansode visited the scene of crime.Earlier this week, the police had detained an associate of Vanraj's father, Suryakant alias Bandu Andekar, who heads the Andekar gang, on charges of conducting a recce on the targeted victims at Ambegaon Pathar. The detained associate was released later with a notice asking him to cooperate with the investigation. The police also arrested two men and seized a country-made pistol and two bullets, which they were to hand over to seven others of the Andekar gang to execute the murder plot on Sept 1, the first death anniversary of Vanraj.Asked about this background, Sharma said, ""We have foiled the murder plot at Ambegaon Pathar by making a couple of arrests and recovering five country-made pistols so far. Our investigation will also focus on establishing a link between that plot and the present crime.""In Feb this year, the police filed a voluminous chargesheet against Sanjeevani Komkar, who is Vanraj's sister, and 20 other accused, along with two minors, involved in the Vanraj Andekar murder case.It is the police's case that a festering gang rivalry between Vanraj's father, Suryakant alias Bandu Andekar (68), and the latter's former aide, Somnath Gaikwad, combined with Vanraj's property dispute with his two sisters, who are married to the Komkar brothers — Jayant and Ganesh — resulted in a conspiracy to eliminate Vanraj. Jayant's other younger brother Prakash is a close aide of Gaikwad, and they planned the murder, the police said. The suspects wanted to hit Suryakant where it hurt most. Vanraj was looking after his father's finances and business interests in Nana Peth, police said.Gaikwad broke away from the Andekar gang in 2021 and started his own criminal outfit at Ambegaon Pathar with a group of Andekar's men from Nana Peth shifting allegiance to him, police added. Gaikwad's aide, Aniket Dudhbhate, who led the assailants in the attack on Vanraj, was looking for a chance to get back at Suryakant, who was among the six men arrested in the Oct 5, 2023, murder of his (Aniket's) close friend Nikhil Akhade, the police said.","19-year-old son of jailed co-accused in Andekar murder case gunned down in Pune.

US Official Claims India Will Backtrack On Tariff, Russian Oil, BRICS And Say Sorry To Donald Trump





Taking a cue from MAGA Supremo Donald Trump 's stubborn stance on tariffs, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Friday signaled a hardening of the US position on tariffs, saying he expected India to say ""sorry"" and make a deal with the President after its businesses realize they cannot thrive without the US market.Asked in a tv interview about Trump's social media post that virtually jettisoned India as a US partner following the SCO summit in Tianjin, Lutnick likened India's position to that of Canada, which he said had backed down from its adversarial ""elbows up"" stance to make a deal after realizing its economy was tanking.""In a month or two months, I think India is going to be at the table, and they're gonna say they're sorry, and they're going to try to make a deal with Donald Trump and it will be on Donald Trump's desk how he wants to deal with Modi, and we leave that to him. That's why he's the president,"" Lutnick said suggesting New Delhi's position was all bravado.Lutnick also warned India to ""Stop buying Russian oil, stop being a part of BRICS , and support the United States and the dollar or face a 50% tariff.""Contending that India and China will not be able to sell goods to each other, he maintained that they will eventually have to come to the US because ""it's our $30 trillion economy that is the consumer of the world... (and) we all know eventually the customer is always right.""Characterizing India as ""the vowel between Russia and China"" (in BRICS), Lutnick said ""If that's who you want to be, go, be it... ....and let's see how long this lasts.""","US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick signaled a hardening of the US position on tariffs.

NEW DELHI: Security has been tightened across Mumbai after the city’s Traffic Police received a threat message on their official WhatsApp number, claiming that multiple terror attacks were being planned.According to police, the message stated that 34 vehicles in the city had been fitted with “human bombs” and warned that the blasts would “shake entire Mumbai.”As the police make security arrangements for Anant Chaturthi, the 10th day of the Ganesh festival, the traffic police control room on Thursday received a threat message, the official said to news agency PTI.He added that the Crime Branch has launched an investigation into the threat, and the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) and other agencies have also been informed.The organisation behind the threat identified itself as ‘Lashkar-e-Jihadi’, further claiming that 14 Pakistani terrorists have entered India.The threat also stated that 400 kg of RDX explosives would be used in the attacks.As Mumbai prepares for the grand finale of the 10-day Ganesh festival this Saturday, police have stepped up security to manage the lakhs of devotees expected to crowd the city’s streets.An official said security has been intensified at sensitive locations, with combing operations underway to prevent any untoward incidents.Authorities are also investigating the source of a suspicious message that surfaced during the festival period.Police have appealed to citizens not to fall for rumours and to promptly report any suspicious activity, assuring that all measures are in place for a safe and peaceful celebration.","Security has been tightened across Mumbai after the city’s Traffic Police received a threat message on their official WhatsApp number.

NAGPUR: Notorious Mumbai don-turned-neta Arun Gawli also called ‘Daddy' stepped out of Nagpur Central Prison on Wednesday after Supreme Court granted him bail in the 2007 murder case of Sena corporator Kamlakar Jamsandekar. After serving over 17 years in a high-security cell, including nine-and-half years in Nagpur Central Jail, the 76-year-old gangster shared a poignant wish with a senior jailor to reconnect with his family and play with his grandchildren, a stark contrast to his fearsome reputation in Mumbai's criminal underbelly.Gawli confided to one of the senior prison officials, his voice heavy with regret, that he missed watching his children grow and now wanted to spend time grandchildren. The emotional confession revealed a softer side of a man, who once ruled Dagdi Chawl in Byculla, offering a glimpse into his longing to reclaim a life lost to incarceration.The release was steeped in drama with Nagpur Police and prison guards orchestrating a fortified security to ensure Gawli's safe exit. Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) personnel and various intelligence units were present to pick up concealed clues.Dodging a throng of media waiting at the jail gates, Gawli was whisked away to Nagpur airport under heavy escort, arriving three hours early for his Mumbai-bound flight.Intelligence sources cited ongoing threats from Dawood Ibrahim 's D-Company, a feud rooted in the violent gang wars of the Eighties and Nineties, as the reason for his cautious departure. Surveillance was ramped up with police videographing the scene.Gawli's conviction in 2012 for Jamsandekar's murder, under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), marked a significant blow to his empire. Sentenced to life, he challenged the Bombay High Court's 2019 ruling upholding his conviction. On August 28, the Supreme Court granted him bail, citing his age and the 17 years already served, pending his appeal.Inside Nagpur Central Jail, Gawli was a model prisoner, adhering to protocols and earning commendations for discipline. He was granted 14–15 paroles and furloughs without incident. ""We recalled seeing Gawli spending time with religious scriptures,"" said a senior prison official. In 2018, he grabbed headlines by taking an exam on Gandhian philosophy, scoring 74 out of 80 marks, earning a certificate and khadi clothes — a surprising twist for a man synonymous with Mumbai's underworld.Gawli's release sparked speculation about his next move. Once a formidable figure who transitioned from crime to politics, serving as an MLA from Chinchpokli (2004–2009) under his Akhil Bharatiya Sena, Gawli's legacy is a complex tapestry of power, crime, and redemption. As he returns to Mumbai, questions swirl about whether ‘Daddy' will revive his political ambitions or embrace the quiet family life he craves.With security concerns looming, particularly from D-Company, his homecoming is anything but ordinary. Mumbai watches closely as the aging don steps into an uncertain future, balancing personal dreams with a past that refuses to fade.","Arun Gawli, 76, was released from Nagpur Central Prison on Wednesday.

Cannot be considered a sin anymore,"" the party had posted in an apparent dig at the central government's GST reforms, which brought down the tax rates on bidis to 18%, much lower than cigarettes and other tobacco products that carry 40% GST.This comes after Sunny Joseph, chief of the Kerala Congress unit, admitted the ""mistake"" and ""lack of caution"" while posting the ""bidis and Bihar"" jibe on social media.Joseph said the 'X' post was deleted and an apology was tendered by the social media team as directed by the state leadership.Kerala state unit of the Congress in a recent post on X, allegedly drew parallels between Bihar and Bidi (a tobacco product) in the wake of the recent GST reforms, and triggered sharp reactions from the BJP.""The post has been deleted.

PM Modi Responds To Donald Trump’s 'Will Always Be Friends' Remark, Says India-US Ties Remain Strong





Former diplomats and analysts are cautioning against reading too much into (President) Trump’s comments dialing down his diatribe against India saying it is typical of his playbook that includes bait and switch to keep perceived adversaries off-balance. At various times, the MAGA supremo has made similar complimentary remarks about leaders of China, Russia, and even North Korea, while trying to get a leg up on the countries amid growing mistrust of Trumpian America across the world.""India has little to no reason to trust the United States after the administration made an elective choice to tank the relationship by undoing even the achievements with New Delhi from President Trump's own first term,” former State Department official Even Feigenbaum wrote in a post on X The wielding of sanctions-like instrument against India and repeatedly referring to tariffs as sanctions, he said, ""has stirred up every conceivable bad historical memory and neuralgia about Washington in India from the past. ”Indeed, forget about salvaging the damaged relationship with India, the Trump regime has by most accounts antagonized even close allies and treaty partners across the world with its MAGA mania. Aside from wrecking ties with neighbors Canada and Mexico, and with nations as far apart as Denmark, Japan, and Brazil, the Trump dispensation on Friday managed to antagonize both North Korea and South Korea with different capers.Hundreds of South Korean workers at a Hyundai plant in Georgia were arrested by ICE agents for alleged visa violations leading to protests in front of the US Embassy in Seoul and the South Korean Foreign Minister rushing to the US to rescue them from detention. The workers were mostly qualified engineers and technicians ramping up on the investment Trump has been extracting from foreign leaders. The incident also offered a preview into what could happen to Indian workers in a Trumpian America seized by MAGA xenophobia.In another development, the New York Times on Friday revealed a secret military operation Trump authorized in his first term to infiltrate North Korea to plant an electronic listening device to monitor its leader Kim Jong-un’s communications ahead of their meeting that was later presented as pathbreaking and friendly.The dangerous mission, carried out by SEAL Team 6, involved a nuclear submarine and mini-subs. But it was aborted when the SEALs encountered a small boat with North Korean fishermen, who they killed before retreating. The SEALs punctured the boat crew’s lungs with knives to make sure their bodies would sink, the report cited one unnamed US official as saying.Also this week, Trump disclosed a military strike on a vessel in the Caribbean that it claimed was carrying drugs and operated by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The strike reportedly killed 11 people.","Former diplomats and analysts are cautioning against reading too much into (President) Trump’s comments dialing down his diatribe against India.

Jewish leaders push back



Wider context: Gaza war and global repercussions







The People’s Conference for Palestine, held last weekend in Detroit, drew thousands of attendees and a roster of high-profile speakers, including representative Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich. ) — but also sparked backlash for fiery rhetoric after a few openly called for violence against Jews.Critics said parts of the three-day gathering crossed into hate speech during the event that aimed to raise Palestinian voices at a time of mounting international scrutiny of Israel’s war in Gaza.Tlaib, the first Palestinian-American elected to Congress, accused Israel of attempting to erase Palestinians through violence and displacement. ""Every genocide enabler, look at this room — we ain't going anywhere!"" she said, declaring, ""Now we're in Congress, and we're in every corner of the United States.""Some speakers went further. Michigan activist Nidal Jboor told attendees opponents of Palestinian liberation ""need to be taken out"" and “neutralised.""Michigan-based doctor and activist Nidal Jboor, said, ""We all know who they are. They need to be locked up.They need to be taken out. They need to be neutralised,"" referring to Jews in Israel, US, Europe and other parts of the world.The program also featured Hussam Shaheen and Omar Assaf, both released in recent prisoner exchanges. Former Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal, serving a life sentence for the 1981 murder of a Philadelphia police officer, addressed the gathering via recorded message.Other speakers included longtime activist Linda Sarsour, UC Berkeley lecturer Hatem Bazian, Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, and left-wing influencer Hasan Piker. ""The Palestinian liberation movement is winning,"" Khalil declared, while Sarsour led chants of ""Free! Free Palestine!""The Jewish Federation of Detroit condemned the conference for providing ""a platform to speakers advocating for the destruction of Israel."" In a statement, it said, ""This conference, which vilifies Zionism, the right to self-determination for the Jewish people, does nothing to advance peace and alarmingly escalates tensions – in Detroit, around the country, and abroad.""The Detroit event comes against the backdrop of the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The conflict began with Hamas' October 7, 2023 attack, in which militants stormed southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli officials.Israel's military response has devastated Gaza. According to Gaza health authorities, more than 64,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began, with large parts of the enclave reduced to rubble. Israel says it is targeting Hamas fighters embedded in civilian areas, while humanitarian groups warn of famine, displacement, and a collapsing health system.Meanwhile, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is considering genocide allegations against Israel, while the International Criminal Court (ICC) has sought arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Hamas leaders on war crimes charges.","Thousands attend People’s Conference for Palestine in Detroit; speakers call for violence against Israelis.

‘Modi & I Will Always Be Friends’: Trump’s Stunning U-TURN After Claiming US Lost India To China





US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) trade ministers’ meeting in South Korea this October.Trump and his senior advisers are “quietly preparing” for the two-day event in Gyeongju on October 31 and November 1, an administration official told CNN.“A visit to South Korea is being discussed, with the focus on economic collaboration,” the official said. “There have been serious talks about a possible bilateral meeting on the sidelines of APEC, but no firm plans have been made.”In a phone call last month, Xi invited Donald and Melania Trump to visit China — an invitation Trump reciprocated, though no dates have been fixed. Preparations for the South Korea trip are still being finalised, and it remains unclear whether he may add other stops.The official further said the administration also views the visit as a chance for the president to secure new economic investments in the United States, a priority he has pursued on recent trips abroad, including to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE.South Korean President Lee Jae Myung extended an invitation to Trump for the APEC summit during a meeting with him last week.A potential Trump–Xi encounter would come against the backdrop of escalating trade tensions, with Beijing a prime target of Washington’s tariff strategy. Both sides have been engaged in negotiations, including two in-person rounds in Europe between top economic advisers.Trump had imposed a 145 per cent tariff on Chinese imports in April, prompting Beijing to retaliate with a 125 per cent levy on American goods. While those higher rates were set to snap back last month, Trump signed an executive order pausing them until November as talks continue.",US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) trade ministers’ meeting in South Korea.

A chaotic morning at the plant



Most arrested were Korean nationals



Largest sweep yet in Trump administration crackdown







A Hyundai manufacturing plant under construction in rural southeast Georgia turned into the scene of one of the largest workplace immigration raids in recent US history on Thursday, as federal agents arrested 475 workers — most of them Korean nationals.The sweep unfolded at the sprawling battery facility in Ellabell, about 25 miles west of Savannah, after months of planning by federal and state agencies. By dusk, hundreds of workers were in custody, transported to the Folkston ICE Processing Centre.Eyewitnesses described the scene as resembling a ""war zone."" Armed, masked agents stormed the site, ordering workers in hard hats and safety vests to line up against the walls, according to a report from CNN. Each was questioned about their legal status, with some handed ""clear to depart"" papers and others led away in handcuffs.“They just told everybody to get on the wall. We stood there for about an hour and were then taken to another section where we waited. Then we went in another building and got processed,” an employee told CNN.Panic spread across the site. Several workers tried to escape, with some hiding in air ducts and others plunging into a sewage pond, only to be pulled out by agents in a boat.“Everyone came out running and told us immigration has arrived,” an unidentified man told CNN. “We hid ourselves in an air duct and it was really hot.”One individual even tried, unsuccessfully, to capsize the vessel, authorities said.“Agents used a boat to fish them out of the water. One of the individuals swam under the boat and tried to flip it over to no avail,” the US attorney’s office said. “These people were captured and identified as illegal workers.”Homeland security investigations said those detained included individuals who had crossed illegally, overstayed visas, or violated visa waivers. Over 300 were confirmed to be South Korean nationals, prompting urgent diplomatic responses from Seoul.South Korea’s foreign affairs minister Cho Hyun said President Lee Jae Myung had ordered “all-out necessary measures” to assist affected citizens. Cho even signalled he was prepared to travel to Washington, DC, to negotiate directly with US officials.Federal officials stressed the raid was not a random roundup but the culmination of a months-long criminal probe into alleged unlawful employment practices at the Hyundai site. The operation involved Homeland Security, ICE, the FBI, DEA, IRS, Georgia State Patrol and other agencies.“This was a meticulously coordinated criminal investigation,” said Steven Schrank, Homeland Security Investigations’ special agent in charge. “Together, we are sending a clear and unequivocal message: those who exploit our workforce, undermine our economy, and violate federal laws will be held accountable.”","Most of the 475 workers arrested were Korean nationals.

US President Donald Trump on Friday said he did not know “anything” about a classified 2019 Seal Team 6 mission in North Korea that The New York Times reported resulted in the deaths of unarmed North Korean civilians.Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump was asked by a reporter, “Can you confirm that it happened?”“I don't know anything about it. I'm hearing it now for the first time,” he responded, as reported by ABC News.The Times cited “two dozen people, including civilian government officials, members of the first Trump administration and current and former military personnel with knowledge of the mission” who spoke anonymously, saying Trump had approved the operation.According to the report, Seal Team 6 commandos were sent to plant a device that would “let the United States intercept the communications of North Korea’s reclusive leader, Kim Jong-un, amid high-level nuclear talks with President Trump.”The Times said US team members feared they had been spotted by a North Korean boat approaching the area. Seals opened fire, killing everyone on board.Upon inspection, none of the people in the boat were armed, and evidence suggested “the crew, which people briefed on the mission said numbered two or three people, had been civilians diving for shellfish.”The Seals returned safely to a nearby large nuclear-powered submarine and fled the North Korean coast undetected. The report also said that no one in the Trump administration informed Congress about the botched mission.","The New York Times reported that Seal Team 6 commandos were sent to plant a device that would “let the United States intercept the communications of North Korea’s reclusive leader, Kim Jong-un, amid high-level nuclear talks with President Trump.” The Times said US team members feared they had been spotted by a North Korean boat approaching the area.

US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that Democrat Zohran Mamdani is likely to become New York City's next mayor unless two of his three major rivals drop out. However, the Republican leader declined to name which candidates he thought should quit.Speaking at a White House dinner with tech executives, Trump denied urging anyone to exit the race but suggested the crowded field benefits Mamdani. ""I don't think you can win unless you have one-on-one, and somehow he's gotten a little bit of a lead,"" Trump said. ""I would like to see two people drop out and have it be one-on-one, and I think that's a race that could be won.""Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, became the presumptive frontrunner after defeating former governor Andrew Cuomo in June's Democratic primary. But both Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams remain on the ballot as independents, joined by Republican Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels.Behind the scenes, Trump allies have floated scenarios for narrowing the race. Intermediaries recently reached out to Adams' circle about the possibility of him dropping his campaign for a federal role, according to people familiar with the talks, AP reported. Adams, indicted last year on corruption charges before prosecutors dropped the case, has said he will not leave the race.""No pressure, no diamonds,"" Adams said Thursday.Cuomo has openly called for Adams to quit, arguing that Mamdani poses ""an existential threat"" to Democrats. Sliwa, meanwhile, rejected speculation that Adams' voters would automatically migrate to Cuomo and insisted he is staying in the race. ""I can assure you for the 9,852th time: I'm not dropping out. I'm in it until November 4,"" Sliwa said.Meanwhile, Mamdani threw down a challenge to Trump, daring him to face off in a televised debate. This came after Cuomo urged him to take part in five debates, one in each borough.""Let's cut out the middle man,"" Mamdani told The New York Post. ""Why should I debate Donald Trump's puppet when I could debate Donald Trump himself?""""If Donald Trump is serious about intervening in the mayoral race, he should come to New York City and debate me directly about why he's cutting SNAP benefits for hungry New Yorkers to give tax breaks to his wealthy donors,"" Mamdani told New York Post.","US President Donald Trump says Democrat Zohran Mamdani is likely to become New York City's next mayor unless two of his three major rivals drop out.

Trump Rebrands ‘Woke’ Pentagon, Announces ‘Department Of War’ | ‘Just Sounds Better…’





The White House on Thursday announced that US President Donald Trump is renaming the department of defence to ""department of war,"" fulfilling his long-standing wish of rebranding it to project a more powerful image.White House, in an official statement, said that Trump will sign an executive order permitting use of the ""department of war"" as a ""secondary title"" for the sprawling department, as Congress establishes its official title.According to Fox News, the move to formally restore the Pentagon's historic name, directing the department of Defence to be once again called the department of war is part of the administration's ""warrior ethos"" campaign.It will make ""department of war"" a secondary title for the agency, with defence secretary Pete Hegseth adopting the title ""secretary of war."" A White House fact sheet says the order also instructs Hegseth to propose legislative and executive steps to make the change permanent.The rebranding will extend beyond titles. A White House official said Pentagon websites and signage will be updated, including renaming the public affairs briefing room the ""Pentagon War Annex.""Longer-term changes are being planned.Trump has teased the shift in recent days, telling reporters on August 25, ""Everybody likes that we had an unbelievable history of victory when it was department of war. Then we changed it to department of defense.""Hegseth, who has already been introduced by Trump as ""secretary of war,"" echoed the president's reasoning, calling the new name symbolic of a cultural shift. ""We won WWI and WWII not with the department of defense, but with a war department,"" he said Wednesday on Fox & Friends. ""We're not just defence, we're offence. Words and names and titles matter.""The department of war served as the nation's primary military authority until 1949, when Congress renamed it the department of defence under the National Security Act of 1947 as part of sweeping postwar reforms.","US President Donald Trump is renaming the department of defence to ""department of war"" The move is part of the administration's ""warrior ethos"" campaign.

Critics blast college over event



Sanders, Mamdani share the stage



College defends venue rental







Brooklyn College is facing sharp criticism for allowing its taxpayer-funded campus to host a Saturday night town hall headlined by senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that prominently featured New York City mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani The event, billed as a “Fight Oligarchy” Town Hall and held at the Leonard & Claire Tow Centre for the Performing Arts, drew scrutiny for what critics say amounts to a partisan rally on public grounds.“This is a political event,” Jeffrey Wiesenfeld, a former CUNY trustee who served during the Giuliani and Bloomberg administrations told The Post. “Sanders is coming to New York to help Mamdani. There is no counterpoint,” he added, noting that other mayoral candidates — including incumbent Eric Adams, ex-governor Andrew Cuomo, and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa — were not invited to participate.Jerry Cammarata, a Staten Island Republican operative and former member of the city’s Board of Education, said hosting the town hall at a public college was inappropriate. “Hold a candidate debate — not defeat the integrity of public education!” he said to The Post. “There should be an outcry from the Board of Trustees, condemning the event and demanding cancellation.”Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist and ally of representaive Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, joined Sanders earlier in the day at the Labor Day Parade along Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue before the two appeared together in Brooklyn.Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa accused Sanders of using the event to pass his “socialist torch” to Mamdani. “He is attempting to bring it full circle … to his protégé Zohran on the campus that fed his socialist beliefs,” Sliwa said to The Post, referring to Sanders’ brief time as a student at Brooklyn College in 1959.Brooklyn College defended its decision to allow the event, noting that the performing arts centre is available to all candidates for rental. “Any candidate is welcome to rent this facility,” the college said in a statement.","Brooklyn College hosted a Saturday night town hall headlined by senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that prominently featured New York City mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani.
