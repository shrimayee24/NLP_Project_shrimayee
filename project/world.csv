NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday went hammer and tongs at the Congress party after US President Donald Trump acknowledged India's 2024 Lok Sabha election was ""influenced"" by the external forces to ""get someone else elected"".Hours after Trump criticised the Biden dispensation's decision to disburse $21 million towards "" voter turnout efforts "" in India, the BJP IT department head Amit Malviya posted multiple clips of PM Modi claiming about the foreign influence during the parliamentary polls.During the poll campaign in the summer elections last year, PM Modi was seen lashing out at the Congress over the ""external influence"".""Nowadays influential people around the world have united to remove Modi but there is the blessing of(women power)(maternal power)... it's yourprotective shield) that Modi keeps working despite facing challenges,"" PM Modi said while addressing a rally in Karnataka's Chikkaballapur in April ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.In another rally at Chhattisgarh's Sarguja, PM Modi said: ""Congresspeople and some influential people in the world lose their cool...if India grows in power, it would spoil the game of some influential people. Today, if India becomes self-reliant...some influential people would lose their jobs.""""Therefore, they want a weak government of Congress and the INDI alliance. The government with issues of infighting, which practices corruption. The history of Congress suggests that can destroy the nation for the greed of power,"" he added.In a television interview PM Modi said: ""The entire world trying to influence India's election, which they shouldn't do. They aren't giving their opinion or comment but influencing it. But they won't be able to influence it.""Further accusing Rahul Gandhi of ""urging foreign powers to intervene in India’s internal affairs"", BJP shared a clip from his visit to London in 2023 and said: ""He has aligned himself with global networks seeking to undermine India’s strategic and geopolitical interests, acting as a tool for foreign agencies.""Earlier, Trump once again questioned the United States' decision to allocate $21 million for voter turnout efforts in India. Speaking at the FII PRIORITY Summit in Miami, he said, ""$21 million for voter turnout, why do we need to spend $21 million for voter turnout in India? I guess they were trying to get somebody else elected.""""We have got to tell the Indian Government. Because when we hear that Russia spent about two thousand dollars in our country, it was a big deal. They took some internet ads for two thousand dollars. This is a total breakthrough,"" he added.Senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad also attacked the Congress party for ""resorting to conspiracies"" and ""maligning India's democracy"".""When people don’t vote for them (Congress), they resort to conspiracies, using foreign money to influence India’s elections. They malign India’s democracy, and we strongly condemn this. This blatant attempt at foreign interference in India’s democratic process is a matter of great shame,"" Prasad said.BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan called Trump's statement a ""smoking gun"" which ""exposes"" the dangerous role of a foreign hand.""President Trump's statement is a smoking gun which shockingly exposes the dangerous role of a foreign hand interfering and influencing the outcome of the Indian elections, but the million dollar question, rather the 21 million dollar question, is which were the Indian hands who were at cahoots with the foreign hands, receiving foreign funds to undermine Indian's democracy and destabilise India's statement..."" said BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan.On Wednesday, Trump also questioned the purpose behind providing $21 million to India for ""voter turnout"" and said that New Delhi is ""one of the highest taxing countries in the world"".This came after Elon Musk-led DOGE’s (Department of Government Efficiency) disclosed that USAID contributed $21 million to EC allegedly for boosting voter turnout.","US President Donald Trump acknowledged India's 2024 Lok Sabha election was ""influenced"" by the external forces to ""get someone else elected"" The BJP IT department head Amit Malviya posted multiple clips of PM Modi claiming about the foreign influence during the parliamentary polls.

"Surrender looted, illegally-held weapons within 7 days or face strict action: Manipur Governor's ultimatum",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/surrender-looted-illegally-held-weapons-within-7-days-or-face-strict-action-manipur-governors-ultimatum/articleshow/118420236.cms,"NEW DELHI: Manipur Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla on Thursday issued an ultimatum to the people of the state urging them to surrender illegally held weapons within the next seven days. In a letter addressed to residents of both the Valley and Hills, Bhalla called for an end to hostilities and a return to normalcy.He appealed particularly to the youth, urging them to voluntarily return looted or illegally possessed weapons to the nearest police station, security outpost, or camp. ""Your single act of returning these weapons can be a powerful gesture towards ensuring peace. I want to assure you that no punitive action would be initiated if such weapons are returned within the stipulated time. Thereafter, strict action will be taken for possession of such weapons,"" he warned.""People of Manipur, both in Valley and Hills, have suffered immense hardship for the last over 20 months due to a series of unfortunate incidents affecting peace and communal harmony. In the greater interest of restoring normalcy, so that people can return to their normal day-to-day activities, all communities in the State must come forward to ensure cessation of hostilities and maintenance of peace & order in the society,"" the governor said.The ultimatum comes amid ongoing violence and security operations in Manipur, where security forces have been conducting widespread crackdowns on militant groups. In recent operations, authorities have arrested multiple militants, including members of the United Kuki National Army and the banned Kangleipak Communist Party.Over the last two days, security forces seized a significant cache of arms and ammunition, including rifles, pistols, grenades, and mortars, from various districts. The rising stockpiling of illegal weapons has been a major concern for authorities, leading to repeated calls for disarmament.The imposition of President’s Rule in Manipur on February 13 has further intensified security measures in the state. The decision came following the resignation of chief minister N Biren Singh, who stepped down amid prolonged ethnic violence that has claimed over 250 lives since May 2023. The state government had earlier withdrawn from the Suspension of Operations (SoO) agreement with the Kuki National Army and other armed groups, leading to renewed clashes.The Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity (COCOMI), a Meitei civil society group, criticised the move as ""undemocratic"" and an attempt to destabilise the state further. In contrast, the Kuki Inpi, the apex body of Kuki tribes, welcomed it as a ""necessary intervention"" and reiterated their demand for a separate administration under Article 239(A) of the Constitution."," Manipur Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla issued an ultimatum to the people of the state urging them to surrender illegally held weapons.

HC upholds life term for 4 tied to Maoist ambush,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-upholds-life-term-for-4-tied-to-maoist-ambush/articleshow/118430172.cms,"RAIPUR: Maoists ambushes are a grave threat to national security , Chhattisgarh HC has said, and upheld the life imprisonment of four men convicted for a 2014 ambush that resulted in the deaths of 15 security personnel and four civilians.The ambush occurred on March 11, 2014, near Tahakwara village, barely 4km from Tongpal police station in Bastar and 390km from Raipur. A road opening party (ROP) of CRPF and state police was targeted by 150-200 Maoists of Darbha Division led by Surendra, Deva, Vinod. The insurgents inflicted heavy casualties and looted six AK-47 rifles, an Insas LMG, eight Insas rifles, and two SLRs.Some suspects were arrested during probe and four of them - Kawasi Joga alias Pada, Dayaram Baghel alias Ramesh Anna, Maniram Korram alias Boti and Mahadev Nag - were sentenced to life imprisonment by an NIA court on Feb 12, 2024. They filed an appeal in HC.A division bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Sinha and Justice Ravindra Kumar Agrawal said that these attacks are ""not isolated criminal acts but part of a larger, well-orchestrated insurgency aimed at destabilising the state and undermining democratic institutions"".The court highlighted the pre-planned nature of the ambush, the use of sophisticated tactics and weaponry, and the intent to inflict maximum casualties. ""These attacks are pre-planned, highly organised, and politically motivated, making them far more dangerous than common crimes,"" the court observed.Such cases are difficult to prosecute due to challenges in identifying and apprehending naxalites, and the reluctance of villagers to testify due to fear of reprisal, HC noted, adding that circumstantial evidence, coupled with witness testimonies and recovery of arms and explosives, can be sufficient for conviction.In this case, the court relied on testimonies of several witnesses, including some former Maoists, to establish the presence and involvement of the accused at meetings where the ambush was planned. The court also considered disclosure statements of the accused and recovery of incriminating materials. The court dismissed the appeals of the Maoists and confirmed the order of the NIA court.","The ambush occurred on March 11, 2014, near Tahakwara village, barely 4km from Tongpal police station in Bastar.

JKSA national convener Nasir Khuehami claimed Hamim had been subjected to ""months of harassment due to a power struggle"" as he captains the 2023-batch cricket team.The accused arrested have been identified as Mohammed Zainul, 23, from Vijayapura; Sameer, 24, from Sandur, Ballari district; Shaik Sawood, 23, from Mudagal, Raichur district; Mansoor Bhasha, 24, from Shiraguppa, Ballari district; and Muzzaffer alias Mujeeb Jamadar, 23, from Indi Taluk, Vijayapura district.The alleged incident took place Tuesday evening during a match between the 2019 and 2022 batches. ""While standing near the boundary line, a senior asked him to stay outside. He promptly moved away. As verbal intimidation escalated, seniors humiliated him, ordered him to perform an ‘Al-Ameen salute', sing songs, and dance for their amusement. They even attempted to force him into their car,"" Khuehami alleged.When Hamim refused, citing college regulations, tensions escalated. ""Sensing danger, he took out his phone to record the incident, hoping it would deter them. Instead, this enraged them. Later in the evening, 6-8 individuals stormed into his hostel room and assaulted him. They repeatedly beat him, forced him to record a video apologising under duress, and issued death threats, warning he would not be allowed to play cricket for the next four years,"" Khuehami added.Following a social-media post tagging PM Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, J&K CM Omar Abdullah, Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah and deputy CM DK Shivakumar, the matter drew attention of Vijayapura Rural police officials, who visited the college to conduct an inquiry.Dr Jilani Awati, medical college superintendent, said, ""The incident was a quarrel between two student teams during the cricket match. Hamim might have informed the Kashmiri student leader, who, unaware of the full context, sought help by tagging officials on social media.

Taylor Swift Gets Dragged Into The Blake Lively - Justin Baldoni Drama Due To Fresh Evidence Hinting At Her Involvement



Isabela Ferrer REVEALS Taylor Swift Helped Her Get ‘It Ends with Us’ Role (Exclusive)

Fans Have Reacted Pretty Strongly As Many Slam Blake Lively For The Whole Drama



Taylor Swift, the billionaire pop star, has been in the news ever since she got booed at the Super Bowl 2025 while her boyfriend, Travis Kelce led Kansas City Chiefs lost the trophy to the Philadelphia Eagles. Away from the Super Bowl drama, Taylor Swift has also gotten herself involved in the legal drama between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, even though she has not been sued. But now it seems like there is some fresh drama regarding it.Famous social media influencer Melanie King recently uploaded a video on X with some fresh evidence that Taylor Swift was indeed “involved” in the making of Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni’s hit movie It Ends With Us. The video has Justin Baldoni talking to an interviewer about the casting for Isabella Ferrer who played the role of young Blake in the blockbuster movie.As Justin Baldoni discusses about finding the perfect person for the role, the interviewer says, “You told me Taylor Swift helped her get the role? Like signed off on audition?”To this, Justin Baldoni says, “I was casting and I had actually brought in and showed her casting tape to Blake and Taylor. They were both like “Yes her!” and that’s a true story”. The interviewer then asked Justin Baldoni how he had convinced Taylor Swift to lend her song for their movie and Justin Baldoni says, “I had nothing to do with it. I mean this is all Blake”.Justin Baldoni continued, “Like I said, Blake was involved in all aspects of this production and she is also a marketing genius”.Melanie King’s caption for the video reads as, “Taylor Swift caught in a HUGE lie. She said she had no part in the casting of this actress for It Ends With Us. Ma’am Justin Baldoni has the receipts. Bless his heart. He was trying to be positive while they were destroying his entire life behind the scenes.”The social media influencer, Melanie King, also went on to add that even though Taylor Swift did not officially cast Isabella Ferrer in the movie, it was her choice that was taken into consider by the production company.Fans have reacted strongly to this. A fan commented, “I don't know that Taylor is lying. She may have just been having conversations with her friend, who then used that to get her way. I'm not saying it didn't happen, but I lean towards Blake twisting things to use the power of Taylor's name”.Another fan wrote, “I suspect Blake has been overstating how involved Taylor actually is.”Taylor Swift has not issued a statement about the whole drama between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni and has remained silent. Blake Lively was recently spotted on the SNL red carpet with her husband Ryan Reynolds. Taylor Swift skipped her friend's birthday party in New York City and has maintained a low profile.Travis Kelce have also not been spotted in public after Super Bowl.Also Read: Bill Belichick and 24-year-old girlfriend Jordon Hudson discuss prenup as their relationship takes a serious turn","Taylor Swift has been in the news ever since she got booed at the Super Bowl 2025 while her boyfriend, Travis Kelce led Kansas City Chiefs lost the trophy to the Philadelphia Eagles.

Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) said she would vote against the confirmation of Kash Patel as the FBI director citing his past comments which, as the Republican senator said, did not suit an FBI director. In the context of prosecutors resigning after facing pressure on how to handle certain cases and FBI agents facing firing over their work on Capitol Riots cases, Collins said the FBI director should be apolitical.""In this context, there is a compelling need for an FBI Director who is decidedly apolitical. While Mr. Patel has had 16 years of dedicated public service, his time over the past four years has been characterized by high profile and aggressive political activity. Mr Patel has made numerous poltically charged statements in his book and elsewhere discrediting the work of the FBI, the very institution he has been nominated to lead. These statements, in conjunction with the questionnaire sent to thousands of FBI employees, cast doubt on Mr. Patel's ability to advance the FBI's law enforcement mission in a way that is free from the appearance of political motivation,"" Collins said in her statement.""While I strongly support efforts to ensure all federal employees perform their responsibilities ethically and in accordance with the law, Mr. Patel's recent political profile undermines his ability to serve in the apolitical role of Director of the FBI.”""Therefore, I will vote against his nomination.""Republican Mitch McConnel who voted against all Trump picks including Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard, RFK Jr, is likely to vote against Kash. After Susan Collins' announcement, now all eyes are on Lisa Murkowski to see whether she also turns against Kash. The voting will turn crucial if more than three Republican senators vote against him. Otherwise, he is likely to get confirmed as teh FBI director today -- a post that he's supposed to serve for the next 10 years.","Republican senator Susan Collins said she would vote against the confirmation of Kash Patel as the FBI director.

“MAGA stands for trying to erase trans people from existence, MAGA stands for resegregation and racism,” says former punter of the Minnesota Vikings, Chris Kluwe

Hi, my name is Chris Kluwe, a 15-year HB resident. I’m here to speak out against both the plaque and the current city council. As the community made clear at the library commission meeting last Tuesday, everyone is in favor of a plaque to celebrate at the library.

But the vast, vast majority are against it, including a MAGA acrostic. Unfortunately, it’s clear that this council does not listen. So, instead, I’m gonna take my time to say what MAGA has stood for these past three weeks.

MAGA stands for trying to erase trans people from existence. MAGA stands for resegregation and racism. MAGA stands for censorship and book bans. MAGA stands for firing air traffic controllers while planes are crashing. MAGA stands for firing the people overseeing our nuclear arsenal. MAGA stands for firing military veterans and those serving them at the VA, including canceling research on veteran suicide.

MAGA stands for cutting funds to education, including for disabled children. MAGA is profoundly corrupt, unmistakably anti-democracy, and most importantly, MAGA is explicitly a Nazi movement. You may have replaced a swastika with a red hat, but that is what it is. I will now engage in the time-honored American tradition of peaceful

civil disobedience

Aftermath of former NFL punter Chris Kluwe’s arrest for free speech

He called it a Nazi movement.And the next thing? He gets arrested for demonstrating democracy! He even went on to say that the swastika was replaced by a red hat. All this happened before a meeting at the Huntington Beach City Council. Chris Kluwe was arrested there for joining other residents who spoke against the MAGA slogan. Chris Kluwe was arrested because of his anti-MAGA rant.To those unversed, here’s ex-Vikings Punter Chris Kluwe’s (free)speech:“Civil Disobedience is often necessary. Thank you @ChrisKluwe”“So much for “free speech” ”“WOW!

‘What is Chinese navy doing this far south?’: Australia and New Zealand monitor ‘unusual’ presence of Chinese warships in Tasman Sea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/what-is-chinese-navy-doing-this-far-south-australia-and-new-zealand-monitor-unusual-presence-of-chinese-warships-in-tasman-sea/articleshow/118435328.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Australia and New Zealand’s response

Australia and New Zealand are vigilantly observing a Chinese naval task force in the Tasman Sea, expressing unease about the warships' unexplained presence in unusually southern waters.The Chinese fleet, comprising a Renhai-class cruiser, a frigate and a supply ship, was initially spotted last week near Australia's northeastern shores, subsequently moving 150 nautical miles east of Sydney, outside territorial waters but within its exclusive economic zone, as reported by The Financial Times.Australia's deputy Prime Minister and defence minister Richard Marles mentioned that whilst the Chinese vessels were operating within legal bounds, their activities were under close observation.""We are keeping close watch on them, and we will be making sure that we watch every move,"" Marles said in a television interview. He observed that whilst Chinese naval presence in the region isn't unprecedented, vessels of this calibre rarely venture this far south.New Zealand's defence minister Judith Collins voiced her concerns about the Chinese government's lack of communication regarding the mission's objectives and future plans.""We have not been informed by the Chinese government why this task group has been deployed into our region, and we have not been informed what its future plans are,"" Collins told reporters in Wellington, according to The New Zealand Herald.One of the ships, the Zunyi, is a Renhai-class cruiser described by the US Naval Institute as ""among the most formidable warships afloat."" The deployment of such a heavily armed vessel suggests China is demonstrating its naval power, according to Collin Koh, a senior fellow at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.""It's meant to signal to Australia and to the US that the PLA Navy is not going to be constrained in movements and actions,"" Koh said, as per The New York Times.Last week, a Chinese fighter jet had a tense encounter with an Australian surveillance aircraft over the South China Sea. The Australian defence forces accused China of ""unsafe and unprofessional"" conduct, while China claimed Australia was engaging in provocation.In September, China launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that landed in the Pacific Ocean, a move that Judith Collins described as contributing to growing regional tensions.Maritime security expert Bec Strating from La Trobe University highlighted that China’s movements could be an intelligence-gathering operation or a signal to Australia about its growing naval presence.""What is the Chinese navy doing this far south? That is the thing causing anxiety. Is this intelligence gathering? Is this really just signaling to Australia that the Chinese are also able to have naval presence in these areas?"" The New York Times quoted Strating.The Australian defence force is monitoring the ships from the sea and air, while New Zealand has deployed its military to coordinate surveillance efforts with Australia.A spokesperson for Australia’s defence department was quoted by Newsweek saying that while Australia respects the rights of all states to operate in international waters, it remains cautious about China's growing naval reach.""Australia respects the rights of all states to exercise freedom of navigation and overflight in international waters and airspace, under international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,"" the spokesperson said.As of now, it remains unclear how long the Chinese naval task group will remain in the Tasman Sea or where it is heading next. Chinese state media has previously referred to similar missions as ""far-sea combat drills"" in the Pacific Ocean.New Zealand’s Judith Collins described the presence of highly capable Chinese warships so far south as a ""significant"" development, adding that both Australia and New Zealand would continue joint surveillance efforts.","A Chinese naval task force has been spotted in the Tasman Sea, 150 nautical miles east of Sydney.

NEW YORK: Six US prison workers accused of beating to death a handcuffed Black inmate were indicted Thursday on second-degree murder charges , in a case that has sparked outrage.Robert Brooks's death at New York's Marcy Correctional Facility in December 2024 was caught on the officers' bodycams.The footage showed several officers restraining a man, whose hands were cuffed behind him for at least part of the attack, with one uniformed officer kicking him during a struggle.As the inmate sat up, visibly wounded, an officer put on a surgical glove and grabbed him again by the collar and, with the help of a colleague, slammed him against a wall.The footage was released by New York Attorney General Letitia James who called the scenes ""shocking and disturbing.""Three others were charged with involuntary manslaughter for failing to prevent the death of Brooks, who was serving a 12-year sentence for assault at Marcy Prison, located near the Canadian border.A 10th prison worker was charged with allegedly cleaning up the scene and attempting to conceal evidence.The accused acted with ""depraved indifference to human life, recklessly engaged in conduct which created a grave risk of death to another person, and thereby caused the death of Robert Brooks,"" the indictment issued by special prosecutor William Fitzpatrick said.New York Governor Kathy Hochul said she had given the order to ""immediately begin the termination process for 14 individuals who were involved in the fatal attack on an incarcerated individual at Marcy Correctional Facility.""""This action comes after I directed an internal review of the circumstances that lead to this individual's death,"" she said.The United States is regularly rocked by violence committed by law enforcement officers.In 2020, the murder of George Floyd, a Black man who was suffocated under a police officer's knee, sparked a huge wave of anti-racism protests across the country.",Robert Brooks's death at New York's Marcy Correctional Facility in December 2024 was caught on the officers' bodycams.

At the FII Priority Summit in Miami on Thursday, US President Donald Trump warned that "" World War III is not so far away"" but said that his leadership would prevent it.

""We’re going to stop people from these stupid, never-ending wars. We’re not going to partake in them ourselves, but we’ll be stronger and more powerful than anybody by far,"" he stated, adding that he doesn’t expect the US to face war.Quoting Elon Musk in a post on X, Trump wrote, ""Elon Musk: The President's instincts on Ukraine are absolutely right. It is really sad that so many parents have lost their sons, and so many sons their fathers in this pointless war.""On Wednesday, Trump criticised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, claiming that the US has spent $200 billion more than Europe while receiving no return on investment. He questioned Europe's financial contributions, accusing Zelenskyy of convincing the US to invest heavily in a war he believes cannot be won. Trump also labelled Zelenskyy a dictator for governing without elections.In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 billion dollars, to go into a war that couldn’t be won, that never had to start, but a war that he, without the US and ‘TRUMP,’ will never be able to settle.""","US President Donald Trump warned that "" World War III is not so far away"" but said that his leadership would prevent it.

She also held key roles as the deputy chief of naval operations for warfighting development and as the director for strategy, plans, and policy on the Joint Staff.

Dudek’s vision for SSA

Michelle King’s departure

Concerns over data access

Leland Dudek , a longtime ' anti-fraud expert ' at the Social Security Administration (SSA), has been appointed as the agency’s acting chief following the sudden departure of Michelle King . His appointment comes amid growing debate over Elon Musk ’s department of government efficiency ( DOGE ) and its efforts to access sensitive social security data.Dudek, who previously led the SSA’s fraud investigation office, has spent his career working to combat fraud within the agency. However, his cooperation with DOGE nearly cost him his job. In a now-deleted post by The Daily Wire., Dudek revealed that he had been placed on administrative leave for working with DOGE officials to identify inefficiencies within SSA.“At 4.30pm EST, my boss called me to tell me I had been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation,” he wrote on his LinkedIn. “They want to fire me for cooperating with DOGE.”Just days later, the tables turned. Instead of being dismissed, Dudek was reinstated and given a major promotion, taking over King’s role as acting commissioner.The LinkedIn post read: “I confess. I helped DOGE understand SSA. I mailed myself publicly accessible documents and explained them to DOGE. I confess. I moved contractor money around to add data science resources to my anti-fraud team. I confess. I asked where the fat was and is in our contracts so we can make the right tough choices.”“I confess. I bullied agency executives, shared executive contact information, and circumvented the chain of command to connect DOGE with the people who get stuff done,” the post continued. “Everything I have ever done is in service to our country, our beneficiaries, and our agency.”Dudek has vowed to lead SSA with transparency. In an email to staff, he emphasised his commitment to protecting the agency’s integrity. Meanwhile, critics fear that his appointment signals greater DOGE influence over social security data.Republican lawmakers have welcomed the leadership change, with Senator Mike Lee’s spokesperson, Billy Gribbin, stating, “There are many good civil servants who have been quietly frustrated for years with politically-motivated mismanagement… Put them in charge, hand them scalpels and flamethrowers.”Dudek will serve as acting commissioner until Trump’s nominee, Frank Bisignano, is confirmed by the Senate. His appointment marks a significant shift in the agency’s direction, with debates raging over whether his leadership will enhance anti-fraud efforts or compromise the security of millions of Americans’ private data.Michelle King’s resignation has raised significant questions, with reports suggesting she was pushed out after resisting DOGE’s attempts to access the SSA’s Enterprise Data Warehouse, a hub containing sensitive information on millions of Americans. According to Nancy Altman, president of advocacy group Social Security Works, King stood her ground against DOGE’s efforts.“She was standing in the way and they moved her out of the way,” Altman was quoted as saying CBS News. “They put someone in who presumably they thought would cooperate with them and give them the keys to all our personal data.”The White House has not provided a reason for King’s departure, but her exit follows a pattern of high-ranking officials resigning or being removed amid concerns about DOGE’s expanding reach.DOGE, created under Trump’s administration and heavily influenced by his adviser Elon Musk, has been accused of overreach, with reports suggesting it has already accessed Treasury payment systems and is seeking entry into Internal Revenue Service (IRS) databases. Altman warned that SSA’s data contains highly sensitive records, including information on nearly every American with a Social Security number.“There is no way to overstate how serious a breach this is,” Altman told The Associated Press. “If there is an evil intent to punish perceived enemies, someone could erase your earnings record, making it impossible to collect the Social Security and Medicare benefits you have earned.”",Leland Dudek has been appointed as the agency’s acting chief following the sudden departure of Michelle King.

Trump hints Democrats in US were backing Congress and Rahul Gandhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-hints-democrats-in-us-were-backing-congress-and-rahul-gandhi/articleshow/118425520.cms,"The TOI correspondent from Washington:

US President Donald Trump has suggested that the Biden administration was ""trying to get somebody else elected"" in India last year with a $21 million USAID grant for voter turnout in the country.Obliquely hinting that his predecessor's administration was backing the opposition Congress Party and its allies, Trump told a Saudi-backed investment conference in Miami, ""We have got to tell the Indian Government... This is a total breakthrough."" Trump is perceived as having a close relationship with Modi despite differences between the two countries on trade.It was not clear what the US President meant by breakthrough, nor did he offer any evidence for his claim. But Trump framed the purported poll interference in India with allegations by many Democrats and liberals in US that Russia puts it thumb on the US election scale to get him (Trump) elected in the US elections in 2016.""Russia spent about $2 in our country. It was a big deal, right? They took some internet ads for $2,000"" Trump scoffed in a reference to frequent charges that he is a ""Putin stooge,"" allegations that continue to echo in liberal and progressive circles in the US, particularly now that he has virtually thrown Ukraine and NATO under the Russian bus.Trump has long resented the allegations and denied them, arguing that he is tough on Russia even though there is no particular reason for Washington to be at odds with Moscow. Republicans and Democrats have also traded charges about each other's alleged shenanigans in Ukraine.Trump has often made the case for US non-interference and against ""nation-building"" in other parts of the world, although that sentiment is now at odds with his and his minions' interference in countries from Canada to Germany to South Africa, and his proposals to evict Gazans and rebuild the territory.The US President's swipe at the previous administration and its purported backing of the Congress party electrified many supporters of the BJP in India who believe Trump and Modi face the same liberal enemies. The BJP's IT cell went to town with the allegations, with its head Amit Malviya charging that US funding for “Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance” spiked in 2022, coinciding with Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra.""There was a systematic attempt to influence the 2024 general election to ensure alternate outcome. This is just a small slice of the larger conspiracy,"" Malviya alleged, referring to Trump's $21 million question.In fact, the US under both Republican and Democratic administrations has a long history of meddling in the politics of other countries, including in India going back to the 1950s when the CIA backed Congress and its allies against the Communist Party in Kerala.The effort, well-chronicled by political historians, was aimed at forestalling the growing ""Red menace"" across Asia, leading to the first elected Communist government outside Russia and China, in Kerala.","US President Donald Trump suggested that the Biden administration was ""trying to get somebody else elected"" in India last year with a $21 million USAID grant. Trump framed the purported poll interference in India with allegations by many Democrats and liberals in US that Russia puts it thumb on the US election scale.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118425547,imgsize-1082278,width-400,resizemode-4/118425547.jpg"
Judge denies union bid to halt Trump firing of government workers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-denies-union-bid-to-halt-trump-firing-of-government-workers/articleshow/118436014.cms,"AP photo

A US judge on Thursday denied a union bid to temporarily halt the firing of thousands of federal employees on probationary status, handing President Donald Trump another legal win in his plan to slash the government workforce.District Judge Christopher Cooper said he lacked the jurisdiction to handle the complaint, one of several filed in courts in recent days in an effort to pause the mass sackings.The judge's decision comes as around 6,700 workers at the 100,000-strong Internal Revenue Service (IRS) who were on probation were being laid off.""The anxiety was running through the floor, like I personally felt anxious because I was one of (the) last people to get that email,"" an IRS probationary worker who was laid off Thursday told AFP.A former IRS official said most of the IRS employees being let go were part of the US tax agency's enforcement teams, less than two months before the US income tax filing deadline of April 15.A number of IRS employees posted messages on LinkedIn saying they had been abruptly terminated and were seeking other opportunities.The National Treasury Employees Union and four other unions that represent federal employees had asked Cooper to issue a temporary restraining order preventing termination of their members who are probationary employees.Cooper, an appointee of former president Barack Obama, said his court lacks jurisdiction to hear their claims and they should instead be brought before the Federal Labor Relations Authority, a body that adjudicates federal labor disputes.""Federal district judges are duty-bound to decide legal issues based on even-handed application of law and precedent -- no matter the identity of the litigants or, regrettably at times, the consequences of their rulings for average people,"" the judge said.- Managers had 'no idea' -The probationary worker who spoke to AFP, on condition of anonymity to freely discuss his former employer, said that managers at the agency had ""no idea"" the layoffs were coming.""I think DOGE has been very careful to make it seem like the agencies themselves are making the decisions, when I can tell, our managers yesterday were just as shocked as we were,"" he said.The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is a free-ranging entity run by Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a top Trump ally and donor.On Thursday, the laid-off IRS worker said staff at his agency were ""a little resigned, a little defeated, including our managers... some of them were, seemed like they were on the verge of tears.""The worker had been a revenue agent on a team that oversaw tax collection for corporations and wealthy individuals.""I think Republicans have really kind of twisted the narrative in the press to say that the IRS has hired a bunch of people to go after middle- or working-class folks, when really a lot of the people that were hired were hired to go after large corporations and high net worth individuals,"" he said.- 'Cruel' -In his opinion, Cooper said the federal government employs 220,000 probationary employees and he noted that workers with that status at the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Park Service and other agencies have already been sacked.On Wednesday, another federal judge declined a request to temporarily block DOGE from firing federal employees.Fourteen Democratic-ruled states had filed suit last week contesting Musk's legal authority but District Judge Tanya Chutkan denied their emergency request to pause his actions.Musk's cost-cutting spree has been met with legal pushback on a number of fronts and a mixed bag of rulings.A judge last week lifted a freeze he had temporarily imposed on a mass buyout plan offered by the Trump administration to federal workers.According to the White House, more than 75,000 federal employees signed on to the buyout offer from the Office of Personnel Management.The fired IRS worker said he had felt ""between a rock and a hard place"" when he received the buyout offer, facing either quitting his job or being fired anyway.""For all of this to happen in such a cruel fashion, just it doesn't make sense to me,"" he said.","A US judge denies a union bid to temporarily halt the firing of thousands of federal employees.

Prince was wounded in the early morning battle, becoming not only the first African American soldier to fight in the revolution but among the very first Americans to spill their blood.""""The garden will predominantly feature incredible women like Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, Billie Holiday, Aretha Franklin and Coretta Scott King,"" Trump said.""We're going to produce some of the most beautiful works of art in the form of a statue for men like Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Jackie Robinson, what a great athlete, MLK Jr., Muhammad Ali, and Kobe Bryant,"" Trump added.During his previous term, Trump had put forward a comparable proposal via executive order. Upon returning to office last month, he reintroduced this executive directive.The East Room event featured Tiger Woods alongside Trump, who addressed a large gathering of guests. ""Welcome to the White House. And we proudly celebrate Black History Month,"" Trump said.He continued: ""Today, we pay tribute to the generations of Black legends, champions, warriors and patriots who helped drive our country forward to greatness.

John James, Alveda King (Martin Luther King Jr.'s niece), Herschel Walker (Trump's nominee for US ambassador to the Bahamas), and prison reform advocate Alice Johnson , who received his pardon in 2020.Johnson had been serving a life sentence without parole for non-violent drug offences before Trump granted clemency.During his speech, Trump specifically mentioned Johnson, announcing his intention to include her in his administration.""She's going to be my pardon czar,"" he stated.The specific responsibilities of this position remain undefined.During the event, Trump said that the chief executive of Pfizer, Albert Bourla, was in attendance — and the mention was met by boos from the crowd.""We also have the head of Pfizer here. So I want to thank him, one of the great, great people, one of the great businessmen,"" Trump said, as the crowd booed.The guest list also included sports and entertainment personalities: former ESPN presenter Sage Steele, ex-NFL player Jack Brewer, and rap artists Kodak Black, Lil Boosie and Rod Wave, according to an anonymous official unauthorised to speak publicly.","US President Donald Trump hosted a Black History Month reception at the White House on Thursday.

Vice President JD Vance who uses his personal account on X unlike any other vice president, expressing his opinions freely, revealed Thursday that there is no team behind his social media posts and he writes everything -- good, bad, ugly. The revelation came on the sidelines of the Conservative Political Action Conference that the vice president opened.""One of my wife's pieces of advice to me was don't be filtered, don't let other people write your tweets. So yes, I write my own tweets, So both the good ones and the bad ones, I take responsibility for,"" JD Vance said.JD Vance has recently been accused of threatening the US constitution after he wrote on X that it is illegal for a judge to try to tell a general how to conduct a military operation. “If a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that’s also illegal. Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power,"" he wrote drawing a volley of criticism.On Thursday, JD wrote a long post on X defending President Donald Trump's stand on the Russia-Ukraine war and how a quote from a book about George HW Bush from a different historical period does not apply to the present scenarios.President Trump launched a blistering attack against Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy after the Ukraine president accused Trump of siding with the Russians.

'Those Who Harm...': Kash Patel Issues First Warning After Becoming New FBI Director | Watch

Who are the Republicans voted against Kash Patel's confirmation?



Kash Patel, Trump’s Pick for FBI Director, Is Confirmed by Senate

Who is Kash Patel?



The Senate confirmed Kash Patel , an Indian-origin FBI director , on Thursday (US time). The nominee received 51 votes in favor while 49 were against his confirmation.After the confirmation, Kash Patel took his account on X and said that his mission as Director is clear, ""let good cops be cops—and rebuild trust in the FBI.""He gave warning to those who tries to harm American, ""We will hunt you down in every corner of this planet.""Republicans Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski joined all 47 Democrats in voting no on Patel’s nomination.Earlier, Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced that she would vote against the confirmation of Kash Patel.""In this context, there is a compelling need for an FBI Director who is decidedly apolitical. While Patel has had 16 years of dedicated public service, his time over the past four years has been characterized by high profile and aggressive political activity. Patel has made numerous poltically charges statements in his book and elsewhere discrediting the work of the FBI, the very institution he has been nominated to lead. These statements, in conjunction with the questionnaire sent to thousands of FBI employees, cast doubt on Mr. Patel's ability to advance the FBI's law enforcement mission in a way that is free from the appearance of political motivation,"" Collins said in her statement.""While I strongly support efforts to ensure all federal employees perform their responsibilities ethically and in accordance with the law, Mr. Patel's recent political profile undermines his ability to serve in the apolitical role of Director of the FBI.”""Therefore, I will vote against his nomination.""Meanwhile, Alaska Sen Lisa Murkowski defended her stance and said that Kash Patel had the opportunity to push back on the administration’s decision to force the FBI to provide a list of agents involved in the January 6 investigations and prosecutions, he failed to do so.Patel, a Trump loyalist and vocal critic of the agency, would take charge during a period of significant upheaval. Recent developments include the Justice Department's removal of senior FBI officials and an unusual request for identifying thousands of agents involved in the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot investigations.As FBI directors serve 10-year terms to maintain independence, Patel replaced Christopher Wray, who resigned before Trump's return to office. Patel previously served as a federal defender and Justice Department counterterrorism prosecutor, gaining Trump's attention through his critical analysis of the FBI's Russia investigation whilst working for the House Intelligence Committee.Kash Patel, a native of Garden City, New York, was born to parents from Gujarat, India. His family's journey began in the early 1970s when they left Uganda due to ethnic discrimination and settled in Canada. They later relocated to the USA after his father accepted a position as a financial officer in an aviation firm.Despite speculation about a private Hindu marriage ceremony, Patel remains single. Whilst his professional achievements are well-known, particularly his firm position on Russia and allegiance to former President Donald Trump, he maintains privacy regarding his personal affairs.His academic credentials include a History and Criminal Justice degree from the University of Richmond, complemented by a JD from Pace University School of Law.He has worked as the Deputy Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Counterterrorism at the National Security Council (NSC). Patel was in charge of executing many of President Donald Trump’s top priorities, including “eliminating ISIS and Al-Qa’ida leadership such as al-Baghdadi and Qasem al-Rimi, and the safe repatriation of numerous American hostages,” says the US Defence Department.According to the US Department of Defence, Patel “served as the former Chief of Staff to Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller and is responsible for leading the Secretary’s mission at the Department, including his executive staff and providing counsel to the Secretary on all matters concerning the Department’s operations.”","Kash Patel, an Indian-origin FBI director, was confirmed by the Senate on Thursday.

In a shocking incident, a Delta Airlines flight turned upside down after crashing on the runway at Toronto Pearson International Airport Monday becoming the latest in a series of aviation mishaps. There was no fatality as all 80 people including the crew managed to crawl out of an upside-down plane. 21 of them were taken to hospital with injuries and by Thursday morning all of them were released.As the harrowing incident is under investigation, Delta reportedly announced a payoff of $30,000 to each of the passengers which raised suspicion as to whether the airlines want to silence the passengers. But reports claimed that taking the money will have no strings attached and the passengers can still sue the airlines for the life-threatening crash-landing.Speculations are rife on social media that the airlines has not revealed the identity of the pilots to safeguard their DEI (diversity, equity and inclusivity) hiring policies. Many viral posts indulged in a gender blame game claiming that all pilots were female -- though the gender had no link to the mishap and Delta did not release any details about the pilots -- neither their names nor gender.Kendal Swanson is the only name doing rounds on X. It has been claimed that she was the pilot of the plane but there were other pilots and the captain -- and these claims are not verified.One viral post with a photo of Kendal Swanson claimed that she was not experienced enough for the landing while the runway was covered in snow. The post said she was an instructor pilot for a small propellor aircraft a year ago and she recently received her licence. Others countered the claims and many questioned who the captain of the flight was as it was the captain's fault to give the landing to an inexperienced pilot, if the claims were true at all.According to the screenshot attached to the viral post, the PIC (pilot in command) was James and the FO (First Officer) was Kendal and the flight attendants were Hollie and Rebecca. Social media users asked if James was the captain, then it was not Kendal's fault.

At least seven passengers belonging to Pakistan’s Punjab province were shot dead late on Tuesday night in Barkhan district, in volatile southwestern Balochistan province.The incident occurred on a Balochistan-Punjab highway running through the Koh-e-Sulaiman mountain range. With 45 passengers on board, the bus was en route to Faisalabad from Quetta, Balochistan’s capital.A senior government official said the attackers burst the tyres of the bus on a highway close to the provincial border with Punjab. “Armed men stopped a Punjab-bound bus, with 45 people on board, on the Balochistan-Punjab highway and off-boarded seven Punjabi passengers after checking identification cards of those on board the bus,” Khadim Hussain, Barkhan’s assistant commissioner, said. “The commuters were lined up and shot dead,” Hussain said, adding the attack was carried out within 10 minutes and the attackers escaped into the Koh-e-Sulaiman mountains.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but ethnic Baloch separatists, who have carried out similar attacks in the past, are the most likely suspects.

Last year, at least 39 people were killed after BLA militants forcibly removed ethnic Punjabi commuters from buses in the volatile province.

Harnai lies some 160 km east of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province.Authorities said they were investigating the attack, with officials saying evidence was being collected and that preliminary investigation showed the explosive material had been planted on the roadside.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack yet. But the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant organisation fighting for independence, is active in the restive province that borders Afghanistan and Iran. The group usually targets security forces as well as Pakistanis from other provinces. Local media reported that most of the workers killed or injured came from KP’s Puran village.The BLA has also targeted Chinese projects in the region, arguing that foreigners are exploiting resource-rich Balochistan while the impoverished residents are left behind.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif responded to the incident by reaffirming his commitment to aggressively working to eradicate terrorism in the country.",A bomb planted by the road exploded as a pickup truck carrying coal mine workers went by.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan denounced on Friday the reference against it in a joint India-US declaration, calling it “one-sided, misleading, and contrary to diplomatic norms”.The joint India-US statement called on Islamabad to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attack and the Pathankot attack and ensure that its territory is not used to carry out cross-border terrorist attacks.“We consider the Pakistan-specific reference in the Indo-US joint statement on February 13, 2025 as one-sided, misleading and contrary to diplomatic norms ,” foreign office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said at a weekly press briefing.“We are surprised that the reference has been added to the joint statement notwithstanding Pakistan’s counterterrorism cooperation with the US,” Khan said. “Such references cannot cover up India’s sponsorship of terrorism, subversion and extrajudicial assassinations in the region and beyond, nor can they shift international attention from the stark reality of India being a safe haven for the perpetrators of hate crimes against Muslims and other minorities,” the FO spokesperson said.“Pakistan is also deeply concerned over the planned transfer of military technology to India. Such steps accentuate military imbalances in the region and undermine strategic stability. They remain unhelpful in achieving durable peace in South Asia,” Khan said.“We urge our international partners to take a holistic and objective view of issues of peace and security in South Asia and refrain from endorsing positions that are one-sided and divorced from ground realities,” he said.","The joint India-US statement called on Islamabad to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attack and the Pathankot attack. “We consider the Pakistan-specific reference in the Indo-US joint statement on February 13, 2025 as one-sided, misleading and contrary to diplomatic norms,” foreign office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118257401,imgsize-34754,width-400,resizemode-4/118257401.jpg"
