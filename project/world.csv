Delhi Family Murder: Throats slit on wedding anniversary: How aspiring south Delhi boxer executed chilling plot to wipe out family,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/throats-slit-on-wedding-anniversary-how-aspiring-south-delhi-boxer-executed-chilling-plot-to-wipe-out-family/articleshow/115988892.cms,"Motives rooted in property and resentment



A well-planned deception



The crime scene and method: Throats slit, stab wounds



A boxer with grudge



Digital footprints under scrutiny



NEW DELHI: In a chilling case that has shocked the capital, a 20-year-old Delhi University student, Arjun Tanwar , has been arrested for the brutal murder of his father, a retired Army officer , his mother and his sister at their home in Neb Sarai .The murders, committed early Wednesday—his parents’ wedding anniversary—were allegedly driven by a deep-seated grudge over property disputes and familial resentment. Police say Arjun carefully planned the crime, even attempting to mislead authorities by feigning innocence.According to investigators, Arjun believed his father, Rajesh Kumar (51), was planning to transfer their family property to his sister, Kavita (23).This, combined with his father’s stern disapproval of Arjun’s boxing ambitions and repeated public humiliation, ignited his fury.“He told us he opted for slitting their throats as he knew it would prevent them from screaming. He was so enraged with his father that he stabbed him in the head,” said the police.Arjun followed his regular routine, heading out for an early morning run at 5.30 am to stage a facade of normalcy.Upon returning, he ran to his gym and informed the owner that his parents had been murdered. He then alerted neighbours and relatives in a bid to avert suspicion.However, a police investigation uncovered inconsistencies in his account. ""When we questioned Arjun, he started giving different answers and there were multiple contradictions,"" said Sanjay Kumar Jain, joint commissioner of police (South).Rajesh’s lifeless body was discovered upstairs, while his wife Komal (46) and daughter Kavita were found in separate rooms on the ground floor.The victims bore horrifying injuries—throats slit, stab wounds aplenty. In a grim detail, clothing had been placed around their necks, likely in an attempt to stem the flow of blood.Arjun reportedly began his killing spree with his sister, who tried to fight back, as evidenced by the injuries on her body.He then moved to his father, attacking him in his sleep. Lastly, his mother, who had gone to the bathroom, was ambushed as she returned.Arjun used his father’s Army knife to carry out the murders, a weapon chosen for its lethal precision.Arjun, a political science student and a trained boxer who had won a silver medal representing Delhi, harboured a profound grudge against his family.He resented his father for supporting his sister, who was pursuing a master’s degree and for frequently reprimanding him about his studies and routine.“Arjun felt neglected and isolated,” police revealed. “He also suspected his father planned to hand over their property to his sister.”Rajesh’s treatment of Arjun, including physical reprimands in public, further fuelled his rage. Sources disclosed that tensions escalated during his sister’s birthday on December 1, when Rajesh allegedly assaulted him again.Police are now examining Arjun’s digital devices to determine if he sought inspiration online to execute the heinous crime.The case, cracked by a team under ACP Abhinendra Jain, exposes the chilling depths of resentment and anger that culminated in a tragedy tearing apart an unsuspecting family.","Arjun Tanwar, 20, has been arrested for the brutal murder of his father, a retired Army officer, his mother and his sister at their home in Neb Sarai.

HYDERABAD: Revathi and Mogadampalli Bhaskar's son Sritej, 9, became a fan of Telugu actor Allu Arjun after watching 'Pushpa: The Rise' three years ago, so much so that neighbours nicknamed him 'Pushpa'.As Sritej battled for life in a Hyderabad hospital on Thursday and his mother's body lay in a mortuary, an inconsolable Bhaskar wondered if 32-year-old Revathi lost her life by putting family above self, as always.She died in the stampede at a city theatre the previous night during the premiere of the sequel to the 2021 'Pushpa' film.""She gave me life, and now she's gone,"" the 40-year-old said. Revathi donated part of her liver in 2023 when he needed a transplant. Her last moments, too, were about making the children happy, he recalled.Sritej and his younger sister Sanvi had been pestering their parents to take them for a show of 'Pushpa 2: The Rule'. Wednesday was supposed to be a special movie night for them, with Arjun being in attendance at the premiere in Sandhya Theatre. Revathi was with Sritej when the stampede broke out, trapping both in a melee of frantic feet. Bhaskar had moved away with Sanvi earlier because the girl started crying amid jostling by fans desperate for a glimpse of the film star.""I decided to drop Sanvi at my in-laws' home in the lane next to the theatre. By the time I returned, my wife and son weren't where I left them. When I called, Revathi said they were inside the theatre... That was the last I heard her voice,"" Bhasker said, breaking down.The bereaved husband believes Revathi was fatally injured in trying to protect their son as the unruly crowd scrambled to escape a police baton charge.Even as he waited outside Gandhi Hospital mortuary, Bhaskar worried about his son who is in a hospital room a few kilometres away, having suffered ""severe hypoxia and potential lung injury"". ""I remember someone showing me a video where Sritej was being carried in a stranger's arms, then being taken in a patrol car that stopped at Chikkadpally police station. He was motionless as they drove him to KIMS Hospital,"" said the anxious father.""I didn't get any updates about Revathi until 2.30am Thursday. That's when some cops broke the news to me, and my world crashed.""Bhaskar has since being trying to convince himself to ""stay strong"" for Sanvi. The little girl, a family member said, was still in a state of disbelief about losing the person she was closest to - her mother.","Revathi and Mogadampalli Bhaskar's son Sritej, 9, became a fan of Telugu actor Allu Arjun after watching 'Pushpa: The Rise' three years ago.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday took exception to the trend of 'grant stay and forget listing the case for hearing' in high courts and said this caused immense hardship to litigants, especially in disputes relating to matrimony and child custody.""This is a sad state of affairs in the judiciary. This pricks our conscience,"" a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan said while reviving the 2019 order of a single judge of Allahabad HC asking the Bulandshahr district judge to inquire into the suitability of an estranged wife's home for a child's upbringing.Ezaz Ahmed married Nazish Parveen in February 2011, and they had a son in Jan 2013. The woman alleged that she was thrown out of her matrimonial home in 2018 over dowry demands and barred from meeting her son. She moved a habeas corpus petition in Allahabad HC demanding custody of her five-year-old child.The single judge of the HC, referring to Muslim personal law, said the mother was entitled to custody of her male child till the age of seven and girl child till she attained puberty. The judge directed the Bulandshahr district judge to inquire in which parent's custody the child's welfare would be best met. The husband appealed against this order before a division bench of the HC, which stayed the single judge's order on Oct 18, 2019. However, on Nov 5 this year, a division bench of the HC vacated the stay it had granted more than five years ago, during which the child has become nearly 12 years old.Frowning at the casual manner in which the stay was granted and its vacation after five years, Justices Kant and Bhuyan said, ""It is unfortunate that the division bench entertained the appeal, which should have been thrown out at the threshold.""Ordering revival of the single judge's 2019 order, the bench said, ""We hope the cause of action of the mother still survives.

""He knew exactly who his father needs to contact and to talk to,"" she said. “He brought in so many young people — he knows his generation,"" she added.This strategy, which saw Donald Trump making high-profile appearances on platforms like ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" and other popular podcasts, helped him gain significant traction with younger audiences.Melania said Barron's suggestions were key to Trump's outreach, as podcasts, YouTube, and social media had become the main platforms for younger voters. ""They are all on the tablets, they are on the phones and all of these podcasts and streamers,” Melania added.Barron’s influence extended beyond his advice on media appearances. The Trump campaign team followed Barron's lead by securing interviews on other popular outlets, including ""This Past Weekend with Theo Von"", ""Flagrant"", and 'Impaulsive' with Logan Paul.These interviews garnered millions of views and drew widespread attention in the final days before the election, changing the perception among young voters that Trump was well-connected and engaged with their generation.Senior Trump adviser Jason Miller praised Barron’s ability to find popular platforms that generate viewership with every media suggestion. “Every single recommendation he’s had has turned out to be absolute ratings gold that’s broke the internet,” Miller said.On election night, Donald Trump gave a shout-out to his son, causing a wave of applause from supporters.

'Attack on democracy'

'Deepens polarisation'

BUCHAREST: Romania's constitutional court on Friday cancelled the country's presidential election following allegations of Russian interference in favour of the far-right frontrunner, just two days ahead of the run-off.Romania's pro-EU President Klaus Iohannis said he would stay in his post until a new government that emerges from legislative elections last weekend can be formed to set a new presidential election date.The country's authorities had objected after far-right outsider Calin Georgescu topped the election's first round on November 24, a shock result in the EU and Nato member bordering Ukraine.On Wednesday, the presidency declassified documents detailing allegations against Georgescu and Russia, including ""massive"" social media promotion and cyberattacks.Based on this, said the court, it had unanimously decided to annul the entire electoral process to ensure its ""correctness and legality"".The process ""was marred throughout its entire duration and at all stages by multiple irregularities and violations of electoral legislation that distorted the free and correct nature of the vote cast by citizens"", it said in its ruling.""All these aspects had the converging effect of disregarding the essential principles of democratic elections,"" it added.Georgescu, a former senior civil servant, had been due to face centrist mayor Elena Lasconi in Sunday's runoff.""It is basically a formalised coup d'etat... Our democracy is under attack,"" Georgescu, 62, said in a video message, calling on Romanians to ""remain faithful to our common ideal.""They will not be able to stop me. And they cannot stop the Romanian people from what they want to change,"" he told local media.Lasconi, a 52-year-old former journalist, also called the court's decision ""illegal, immoral... crushing the very essence of democracy"".Fears had been raised that if Georgescu won, the country -- whose strategic importance has increased since Moscow invaded Ukraine -- would join the EU's far-right bloc and undermine European unity against Russia.While Bucharest streets were largely empty late Friday, without any protests taking place as far as AFP journalists could see, several people condemned the court's decision.""We are upset because this is a political game"" to allow the losers to ""get back in the game"", said Marius Neagu, a 48-year-old salesman.Miruna Mihai, 25, said the decision ""is a slap in the face of everyone who voted in this election"" and risked ""radicalising"" Georgescu's supporters.IT worker Madalina Stroe, 34, welcomed it however, saying she didn't want Romania ""to go back in time to Communism in case Georgescu was elected. I don't want us to lose our freedom"".Outgoing Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu -- who lost in the first round of presidential elections -- hailed the decision as ""the only correct solution"".Late on Friday, the United States said it had faith in Romania's institutions and called for a ""peaceful democratic process"".""We call on all parties to uphold Romania's constitutional order and engage in a peaceful democratic process free from threats of violence and intimidation"", said State Department spokesman Matthew Miller.Anti-corruption prosecutors said Friday they had opened an investigation into ""illegal operations with computer devices or software"".Prosecutors are already probing ""possible violations of electoral legislation"" and ""money laundering offences"".In documents drawn up for a security council meeting and published Wednesday, authorities said data had ""revealed an aggressive promotional campaign, in violation of electoral legislation"".Last week, authorities condemned ""preferential treatment"" of Georgescu by TikTok, something the social media platform has denied.The European Commission announced Thursday it had stepped up monitoring of TikTok.A separate intelligence services document stated that Romania was a ""target for aggressive Russian hybrid actions"", including cyberattacks.On Monday, before the documents were released, Romania's constitutional court validated the first-round presidential results.Friday's decision to cancel the elections is ""an unprecedented and historic decision"", political analyst Costin Ciobanu told AFP.It ""deepens uncertainty and polarisation within Romanian society, raising serious concerns about the strength of Romania's institutions and democracy"", he added.Georgescu shot into the limelight with his performance in the first round of voting.Having praised Russian President Vladimir Putin in the past, he has more recently avoided answering questions about him being pro-Russian.While the president's post is largely ceremonial, the head-of-state has moral authority and influence on Romania's foreign policy.The president also designates the prime minister -- a key role especially since legislative elections last weekend returned a fragmented parliament.The governing pro-European Social Democrats won the vote, but far-right parties made strong gains, together securing a third of the ballots.Since the 1989 fall of Communism, Romania has not seen such a breakthrough by the far right, fuelled by mounting anger over soaring inflation and fears over Russia's war in neighbouring Ukraine.",Romania's constitutional court cancels the country's presidential election.

Democratic decline is mostly considered to be a slow degeneration of a nation’s body politic that plays out over years. But it can also be as sudden as a heart attack. That was certainly the case in Seoul this week, when President Yoon Suk Yeol sought to smother the opposition and muffle media by putting the country under martial law.Resolute lawmakers had to scale walls to enter a cordoned off parliament — as their aides used fire extinguishers to beat back armed forces — to pass a bill to reverse Yoon’s order. This time, the martial law lasted all of six hours, but Korea, since its inception in 1948, has seen 16 instances of martial law — the last time was in May 1980, almost 45 years ago.After winning the tightest presidential race in Korean history, Yoon has had a torrid time in office. He had to issue a public apology after his wife’s acceptance of an expensive designer bag sparked an outcry. He also used his veto power to kill a bill that sought to investigate the first lady. All that didn’t help his popularity ratings and his party suffered a landslide defeat in parliamentary polls earlier this year.","President Yoon Suk Yeol sought to smother the opposition and muffle media.

Unitedhealthcare CEO Murder: Brian Thompson's killer is not a hitman? 3 reasons why experts think so,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/brian-thompsons-killer-is-not-a-hitman-3-reasons-why-experts-think-so/articleshow/116052773.cms,"Brian Thompson's killer made several slip-ups which a professional hitman won't do, according to experts.

Killer had to fire several shots

CEO killer had no perfect escape plan



Killer left a trail of clues

Though the NYPD is yet to nab the killer who gunned down Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare Wednesday in front of a hotel early in the morning with many witnesses, experts are of the view that the man was not a hitman. Not much is known about the killer but he left a trail of clues and was captured in many CCTV footage which makes the experts conclude that this was a person who made up his mind about what he did. That's it.Experts who analyzed the CCTV footage claimed that though the killer was deft in handling the gun, he might not be a trained shooter because he had to fire many shots and shooting in the calf is not a sign of a professional hire, they think. ""Forgive me for saying too much on too little evidence, but it looks like the kind of guy that made up his mind that he was doing the right thing,"" David Shapiro, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, and a former FBI special agent told NYT. ""He didn't look like a guy that was fearful."" The killer might have had military or law enforcement training or maybe he is a hunter or has practiced at a range.Cops are yet to get a breakthrough in the case but experts think the killer did not have a proper escape plan. Hopping on an e-bike and riding toward Central Park does not impress experts as a murder escape plan. Choosing midtown Manhattan to murder the CEO is a rash idea where there are cameras everywhere.Before the shooting, the man stayed in a hostel on the Upper West Side of Manhattan where he shared a room with other guests. He let the CCTV camera catch his smiling face as his mask slipped. Reports said he took off his mask and smiled while he was apparently flirting with the receptionist of the hotel. Just before the murder, he stopped by a Starbucks where he bought coffee, a bottle of water and two PowerBars.The bullet casings left by the killer had three words engraved on them ""Deny"", ""defend"" and ""depose"" -- similar to the title of Jay M Feinman's 2010 book 'Delay, Deny, Defend'.A former police investigator from Kansas City, Gary Jenkins, told NYT that it was likely ""somebody that has an ax to grind"".","Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was gunned down in front of a hotel early in the morning with many witnesses.

Contested future for TikTok

Political dynamics

Implications for tech landscape

A US federal appeals court has upheld a law requiring ByteDance, the China-based parent company of TikTok, to divest its US operations by January 19, 2025, or face a nationwide ban on the app.The decision, delivered on Friday, intensifies the platform's legal and operational challenges while escalating tensions between the United States and China.The ruling by a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia was described as a significant victory for the Justice Department, which has long argued that TikTok poses a national security threat.The court stated that the divestment law passed with bipartisan support, was designed to protect US national security interests against potential threats from China's influence over the app.TikTok, which boasts 170 million users in the United States, is expected to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.The company argues that the divestment law infringes on First Amendment rights and constitutes censorship. ""The Supreme Court has a strong track record of defending Americans' free speech, and we are confident they will uphold this principle in our case,"" TikTok said in a statement.The law prohibits app stores and internet hosting services from offering TikTok after the deadline unless ByteDance sells its US operations.While ByteDance has denied allegations of sharing data with the Chinese government, US officials have raised concerns over data security and potential manipulation of information on the platform.The decision leaves the ultimate enforcement of the ban in the hands of President Joe Biden, who could grant a 90-day extension if significant progress is made toward a sale, and President-elect Donald Trump, who will take office the day after the January 19 deadline.Trump, who attempted to ban TikTok in 2020, has since reversed his stance, expressing opposition to a ban during his recent presidential campaign.The ruling is already drawing criticism from free speech advocates. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) called the decision ""flawed and dangerous,"" arguing it sets a troubling precedent for censorship.If enforced, the ban could significantly reshape the social media landscape, benefiting rivals such as Meta and Alphabet's YouTube. Meta's shares surged following the ruling, reflecting investor optimism about reduced competition in the online advertising space.Despite the uncertainty, TikTok has continued to expand its US operations, including reporting $100 million in Black Friday sales through its e-commerce venture.However, analysts warn that a ban could disrupt content creators and businesses dependent on the platform while deepening the rift in US-China relations.As the deadline looms, all eyes are on the Supreme Court and the incoming administration to determine TikTok's fate in the United States.","Appeals court upholds law requiring ByteDance to sell US operations by January 19, 2025.

Stowaway who boarded New York-to-Paris flight claims she sought asylum in France,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/stowaway-who-boarded-new-york-to-paris-flight-claims-she-sought-asylum-in-france/articleshow/116060406.cms,"Representative image

NEW YORK: A Russian woman with permanent US residency who was returned to the United States after authorities said she sneaked on board a flight from New York to Paris made her first appearance in court Thursday, claiming she has been abused.Svetlana Dali , wearing jeans, seemed agitated as she spoke through a Russian interpreter to her attorney during a brief appearance before a Brooklyn magistrate judge.Her lawyer, Michael Schneider, said she claims she was poisoned after arriving in Paris and then was returned to the United States despite requesting asylum there.She also claimed through Schneider that her treatment at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn amounted to torture after she was placed in a ""very cold"" room where she felt sick and eventually lost consciousness.""She believes if she's staying at the MDC, her life will be in danger,"" Schneider said.When he told Magistrate Judge Robert M. Levy that she was requesting a spectrometer be used to test her blood and determine if she had been poisoned, the judge responded that he's ""not sure"" the device was in the jail's commissary.She will be housed in the federal lockup a second night after lawyers agreed to postpone a bail hearing until Friday so enough information could be gathered to create a bail package.Assistant U.S. Attorney Brooke Theodora said the government's chief concern was that Dali was a risk of flight.She did not protest when Schneider said the single federal stowaway charge she faced was a ""minor charge"" comparable to being arrested for jumping a turnstyle to enter the city's subway system.A criminal complaint filed in Brooklyn federal court said Dali admitted to an FBI agent who interviewed her when she returned to Kennedy International Airport on Wednesday that she flew to Paris as a stowaway on a Delta Air Lines flight on Nov. 26.The complaint said airport surveillance footage showed that she was initially rebuffed by a Transportation Security Administration official because she lacked a boarding pass when she first tried to enter Kennedy's Terminal 4.Five minutes later, she successfully accessed the security screening machines without a boarding pass by entering a special lane for airline employees at the same time that a large Air Europa flight crew walked through, the complaint said.It said she got onto the Delta flight without presenting a boarding pass as airline agents who were helping other ticketed passengers board failed to stop her or ask her to present a boarding pass.Once on the flight but before it landed at Charles de Gaulle Airport, Delta employees realized she was not authorized to be on the plane and asked for her boarding pass, which she could not provide, the complaint said.When the plane landed in Paris early on Nov. 27, French law enforcement met her at the gate and detained her before she entered customs, it said.During her interview with U.S. law enforcement, Dali was shown images from airport security showing her bypassing TSA officials and Delta employees.The complaint said she confirmed the images were of her and ""also stated that she knew her conduct was illegal.""In a statement, Delta Air Lines thanked French and U.S. authorities for their assistance and said a review had concluded that its security infrastructure was ""sound and that deviation from standard procedures is the root cause of this event.""It added: ""We are thoroughly addressing this matter and will continue to work closely with our regulators, law enforcement and other relevant stakeholders. Nothing is of greater importance than safety and security.""","Svetlana Dali, wearing jeans, seemed agitated as she spoke through a Russian interpreter to her attorney during a brief appearance before a Brooklyn magistrate judge.

Biden team mulling pre-emptive pardons for Trump critics: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-team-mulling-pre-emptive-pardons-for-trump-critics-report/articleshow/116060218.cms,"US President Joe Biden (File photo)

WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden's staff is debating whether he should issue blanket pardons for a swath of President-elect Trump's perceived enemies to protect them from the ""retribution"" he has threatened after he takes office, according to people familiar with the discussion. The idea would be to preemptively extend executive clemency to a list of current and former govt officials for any possible crimes over a period of years, effectively short-circuiting the next president's promised campaign of reprisals.The discussion of blanket pardons, remains primarily at a staff level, although Biden has talked about it with senior members of the team, according to the people familiar with the matter. It comes after Biden pardoned his son Hunter to spare him from prison on gun and tax charges. The White House declined to comment Thursday.Such a sweeping act of clemency covering even theoretical crimes over the course of a decade went beyond the scope of any since at least the Watergate era, when President Gerald Ford pardoned his disgraced predecessor, Richard Nixon, for any crimes even though he had not been charged. Never before has a president issued mass pardons of govt officials for fear that a successor would seek to prosecute them out of partisan vindictiveness.But the choices of Pam Bondi , a former Florida attorney general and Trump surrogate, to run the justice department and Kash Patel , a Trump ex-aide and far-right provocateur, to be director of the FBI have put the issue front and center. Patel has vowed to ""come after"" Trump's critics and even published a list of about 60 people he considered ""members of the executive branch deep state"" as the appendix to a 2023 book.Ed Siskel, the White House counsel, is leading the talks as part of a broader plan to issue pardons and commutations to more traditional recipients.Among those whose names have been floated are former Representative Liz Cheney , who was vice chair of the bipartisan committee that investigated Trump's role in the Jan 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol; Anthony Fauci, the former top infectious disease expert for the govt; Jack Smith, the outgoing special counsel who prosecuted Trump; and Senator-elect Adam B Schiff, who was a lead House prosecutor at Trump's first impeachment trial.",President Joe Biden's staff is debating whether he should issue blanket pardons for a swath of President-elect Trump's perceived enemies.

The judge presiding over Daniel Penny's trial has dropped the top manslaughter charge at the prosecution's request after jurors deadlocked on a verdict on Friday.The jury will now deliberate a lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide , Judge Maxwell Wiley ruled while urging jurors to “go home and think about something else” before continuing deliberations.Earlier in the day, the jury deliberating in the Daniel Penny manslaughter trial informed Judge Maxwell Wiley that they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict on the top charge of manslaughter in the subway death of Jordan Neely.Penny, a Marine veteran, is accused of using a fatal chokehold on Neely during a subway altercation on May 1, 2023.The Manhattan jurors, deliberating since Tuesday, had sent a note to the judge stating their impasse. Judge Wiley responded by delivering an Allen charge, a legal instruction encouraging jurors to re-evaluate differing opinions and attempt to reach a consensus.He praised the panel’s conscientious efforts but reminded them that failing to agree could result in a retrial with a new jury.The case centres on Penny’s actions during an encounter with Neely, a homeless man with a history of mental health struggles. Penny’s defence argued he acted to protect himself and others from Neely, who witnesses described as making erratic and threatening remarks.Prosecutors contend that Penny used excessive force, failing to consider Neely as a person in crisis.As per the New York times, Jurors were instructed to first address the manslaughter charge, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years, before moving to the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide.The latter carries penalties ranging from probation to four years in prison. Wiley indicated that he might allow deliberations on the second charge if the deadlock would have persisted on manslaughter.The trial has drawn significant public attention, with demonstrations outside the courthouse and broader debates over race, mental health, and public safety .Neely, 30, was a sometime subway performer with a tragic life story: His mother was killed and stuffed in a suitcase when he was a teenager. His adult life spiraled into homelessness, psychiatric hospitalisations, drug abuse and criminal convictions, including for assaulting people at subway stations, according to AP.Penny, 26, went on to study architecture. He is white. Neely was Black. The case became a flashpoint in the nation’s debate over racial injustice and crime, as well as the city’s ongoing struggle to deal with homelessness and mental health crises in a transit system used by millions of New Yorkers every day.The jury’s deliberations have been detailed and thorough, including requests to review video evidence, medical testimony, and definitions of legal terms like recklessness and negligence.Jurors asked for clarification on how to define a “reasonable person” and whether such a person would have believed Neely was about to use physical force. Judge Wiley told them it was their responsibility to decide what constitutes a reasonable reaction under the circumstances.During the monthlong trial, the anonymous jury heard from witnesses, police, pathologists, a Marine Corps instructor who trained Penny in chokehold techniques, as well as Penny’s relatives, friends and fellow Marines. Penny chose not to testify. The jury has made several requests to the judge since entering deliberations Tuesday, The New York Times reported.Discussions are expected to continue into next week if no resolution is reached.","Daniel Penny, 26, is accused of using a fatal chokehold on homeless man Jordan Neely, 30, during a subway altercation on May 1, 2023.

Self-reflection and campaign dynamics

Looking ahead

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate in the recent presidential election, opened up about the Democratic ticket’s loss in his first interview with local Minnesota media.Speaking with KSTP-TV, Walz admitted he was taken aback by the results, noting, “I was a little surprised we lost. I thought we had a positive message, and I thought the country was ready for that.”Walz reflected on the momentum he felt on the campaign trail, stating, “It felt like at the rallies, at the things I was going to, the shops I was going in, that the momentum was going our way. And it obviously wasn’t at the end.”His remarks come after the Democrats faced a significant electoral defeat, with Donald Trump reclaiming the presidency and Republicans gaining control of the Senate while maintaining a House majority.Walz candidly addressed the challenges the campaign faced, saying, “Are there things you could’ve done differently? Since we lost, the answer is obviously yes. On this one, I did the best I could.”As per The New York Times, Walz expressed disbelief at Trump’s appeal to middle-class voters, remarking, “To have Donald Trump seen as a champion of the middle class, I fully don’t see how that would happen, but I recognise that’s where people voted.”He avoided directly critiquing Harris or her campaign strategy, instead focusing on the broader political landscape. “I think we have to decide: is the message the right one?” he said in an interview with WCCO-TV.Since the election, Walz has shifted his focus back to state governance. According to KSTP-TV, Minnesota’s House of Representatives is now evenly split at 67-67, setting the stage for a challenging legislative session.Walz expressed optimism about working with the new dynamics, stating, “Coming back here now and having the privilege to be able to continue to do this work feels really good.”The governor also reminisced about campaign highlights, including the moment Harris introduced him as her running mate at Temple University. “She turns to me, and she says, ‘Well, let’s not screw this up,’ and we went out there,” he recalled to KMSP-TV.Though Walz remains uncertain about his political future, including whether he will seek a third gubernatorial term in 2026, his reflections suggest a leader ready to adapt and move forward.As he told KSTP-TV, “I think we made an impact, but the voters have spoken.”","Minnesota Governor Tim Walz opened up about the Democratic ticket’s loss in his first interview with local Minnesota media.

Donald Trump, the president-elect of the United States, mocked Canada and Mexico during a Fox Nation awards ceremony in New York on Thursday.The event, celebrating Trump as “Patriot of the Year,” included a chant of ""51! 51! 51!"" from the audience, alluding to Trump’s remarks about Canada potentially becoming the 51st US state.The chant followed Trump’s comments about threatening Canada with a 25 per cent tariff on imports. Trump recounted his meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at Mar-a-Lago, where he suggested tariffs would devastate Canada’s economy.While Canadian officials dismissed Trump’s remark as a joke, he made no effort to clarify it during his speech.“Justin came flying right in because we talked about 25 per cent tariffs. That’s just the beginning,” Trump said, as the crowd erupted into the chant. Trump responded, “I appreciate all that pent-up anger and love.”In the same event, Trump also discussed his call with Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum, claiming that his threat of tariffs led to a swift halt to illegal immigration.He described Sheinbaum as “a very nice woman” but reiterated his tough stance, saying, “You’re allowing criminals to pour into our country, and we can’t allow that anymore.” In contrast, Sheinbaum characterised the conversation as “kind” and denied any risk of a tariff war.During the 10-minute address, Trump outlined plans to reform immigration, proposing mass deportations and stricter election laws, including voter ID requirements and one-day voting. Trump also praised his first-term achievements, such as constructing 571 miles of border wall.The event highlighted Trump’s rapport with Fox News, with Sean Hannity presenting the award.Trump also commended Fox while taking jabs at unnamed critics within the network. The ceremony also honoured individuals such as actor Kirk Cameron and late NYPD officer Jonathan Diller.","Donald Trump mocked Canada and Mexico during a Fox Nation awards ceremony in New York on Thursday.

Growing threat from Baloch separatists

Sectarian violence fuels instability

Border tensions and counterterrorism efforts

What lies ahead

Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month, according to a report by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). The number of fatalities also surged by 69%, climbing from 100 in October to 169, with 225 others injured.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a banned group, carried out 12 attacks in November, including three high-impact incidents that resulted in 45 deaths. These figures surpassed the fatalities caused by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), indicating a shift in the BLA's operational strategy. Experts suggest this escalation requires a reassessment of counterterrorism tactics.The majority of these attacks in Balochistan targeted security forces and civilians. Notable incidents included an assault on the Quetta railway station, an attack on a police van in Mastung, and a strike on a security check-post in Kalat, which collectively accounted for 91% of the province’s fatalities.Sectarian violence added another layer to the country's security challenges, particularly in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Seven incidents, including two terror attacks and five sectarian clashes, claimed 115 lives and left 137 injured. The violence was triggered by an attack on passenger buses on November 21, which spiraled into broader sectarian unrest.KP remained the most affected province, with 41 terrorist attacks leading to 114 deaths and 95 injuries. The TTP, Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-i-Islam, and other local factions were linked to most of these incidents.The report also highlighted six incidents of border violence along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, resulting in 25 terrorist deaths and 11 injuries. This underscores the ongoing instability in the region and the challenges posed by cross-border insurgents.Security forces conducted 19 counterterrorism operations in November, killing 53 terrorists. Most of these operations were concentrated in KP and Balochistan, the epicenters of recent violence.The PIPS report paints a grim picture of Pakistan's security landscape, with 98 conflict-related incidents causing 338 deaths and 411 injuries in November alone. Experts suggest that the evolving nature of terror threats, including the increasing lethality of BLA operations and persistent sectarian tensions, requires urgent and innovative policy responses.As Pakistan grapples with these challenges, the question remains: can the state adapt quickly enough to address the multifaceted threats destabilizing the country?","Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month.

PESHAWAR: The death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surged to 130, with at least six people killed and eight injured on Sunday, as clashes in the volatile Kurram district continued for the eleventh consecutive day.The clashes between Alizai and Bagan tribes in the district started on November 22, after an attack on a convoy of passenger vans near Parachinar in which 47 people were killed a day earlier. Several passengers who had sustained grave injuries succumbed later, raising the toll in the convoy killing to 57.Police said the situation remained tense, and violence persists despite a recent ceasefire agreement between the Sunni and Shia groups.The six new deaths reported on Sunday brought the death toll to 130, while the total number of injured rose to 186 after eight fresh injuries were reported.The 10-day truce brokered last week has been rendered ineffective by intermittent violence, which shows no signs of abating.A high-powered delegation, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry and IGP Akhtar Hayat Gandapur, had also negotiated a ceasefire last weekend, but violence resumed shortly afterwards.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi earlier planned to dispatch members of the grandpeace jirga (council of tribal leaders) from Kohat division to Kurram for engaging with leaders from both warring factions to negotiate peace.Addressing a gathering of political leaders and tribal elders in Kohat on Sunday, he called for strict action with public cooperation to make the region weapon-free through joint operations.He said he was ready to go to Kurram and stay there for as many days as the jirga suggested to ensure peace in the region.""No other country or province will resolve our issues. We must take responsibility for improving the situation ourselves,"" he said.Kundi announced an All-Parties Conference (APC) for peace and the province's rights and invited Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur to join it.The governor stressed the role of religious scholars in promoting peace, urging them to focus on unity.Several other leaders addressed the gathering, putting aside their ideological differences on other issues.The continued violence forced the closure of the main Peshawar-Parachinar Road for travel, and commuting at the Pak-Afghan Kharlachi border has also been suspended.The closure of the main arteries has created a scarcity of oil, food commodities and medicines in the region.The Kurram region is also experiencing a communication blackout, with mobile and internet services suspended and educational institutions closed.Police and other security forces personnel had been deployed in various parts of Lower Kurram, said Deputy Commissioner Javed Ullah Mehsud, adding that all-out efforts will be made for a truce in other areas today as well.""We are hopeful for progress on a ceasefire and reopening of transport routes,"" he stated.Previous efforts to mediate peace, including a seven-day truce brokered by provincial officials in November have failed to hold.","Death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surges to 130.

Bangladesh's Yunus seeks help of religious leaders in collecting accurate info about attacks on minorities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladeshs-yunus-seeks-help-of-religious-leaders-in-collecting-accurate-info-about-attacks-on-minorities/articleshow/116017113.cms,"DHAKA: Bangladesh interim government head Muhammad Yunus on Thursday sought the cooperation of the religious leaders in collecting accurate information about attacks on minorities and bringing the perpetrators to justice amid reports of attacks on Hindus in the country. Speaking at a meeting of religious leaders of Bangladesh here, Chief Adviser Yunus said that the issue of attacks on minorities has come up again and there is a gap of information between the reality and the news published by foreign media.""We want to know the accurate information and want to establish the process of getting the information,"" he was quoted as saying by the state-run BSS news agency.Yunus did not specify the ""foreign"" media, but several of his colleagues in the interim cabinet and aides have accused a section of Indian media of propagating misleading information, particularly on persecution of the Hindu community.Addressing the meeting attended by leaders of the Muslim, Hindu, Christian and Buddhist communities, Yunus said he called the meeting as ""several questions aroused in my mind seeing what the (foreign) media reports and hearing what people are saying"" and sought the religious leaders cooperation and suggestions in collecting ""accurate information"" and addressing the issue.""There is no difference between our goals. Please tell us how we will get the correct information. At times dependence on official information gives no benefit. They (officials often) say what will appease the superior, preferring not to speak out the truth,"" he said.Yunus said all the citizens of Bangladesh have equal rights and it's the responsibility of the state to ensure their rights are guaranteed.If any incident of attack on minorities takes place in the country, information must be collected immediately on such incidents and the perpetrators must be brought to justice, he said.""Those who are guilty must be held accountable for their actions,"" he said.The chief adviser stressed taking measures to create an environment to prevent such incidents and ensuring immediate remedy for victims.""I think most of the people of Bangladesh agree with what I have said,"" he added.""We are not enemies of one another despite our differences,"" he was quoted by the Daily Star newspaper as telling the religious leaders.""I have asked you to join (today's dialogue) to know how information could be gleaned in a safer way so that the information providers do not fall in trouble,"" he said.Yunus said when he assumed the office in August following then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster, reports of minority repression prompted him to issue a clarion call for national unity as ""one family"" despite differences in faiths, opinions and traditions.Referring to his visit to Dhakeswari Temple in Dhaka on the occasion of Durga Puja, he said the Hindu festival was celebrated with festivity in the country while people from all strata joined it, turning the event into a national festival.The minority Hindu community in Muslim-majority Bangladesh has reportedly faced more than 200 attacks in 50-odd districts after Hasina's Awami League government fell on August 5.","Bangladesh interim government head Muhammad Yunus seeks cooperation of religious leaders. Yunus says there is a gap of information between reality and news published by foreign media.
