Extension in service setback to those in line: Vice president Dhankhar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/extension-in-service-setback-to-those-in-line-vice-president-dhankhar/articleshow/117160579.cms,"Photo/ANI

BENGALURU: Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Saturday flagged concerns over hiring of retired persons and the trend of govt officials getting extensions in service or a particular post, remarking they are a setback to others in line.Delivering the inaugural address at the 25th National Conference of Chairpersons of State Public Service Commission in Bengaluru, the VP said it defies expectations of many in the queue and is against the doctrine of expectation. He said people devote decades to be in a ""particular groove"" and extensions indicate that some individual is indispensable, though indispensability is a myth. ""Therefore, it lies in the domain of public service commissions at the state and the central levels that when they have a role in such situations, they must be firm,"" the VP said.Dhankhar added that in public service commissions, the appointment cannot be driven by patronage or by favoritism. The public service commission chairman or a member can't be wedded to a particular ideology or an individual as that will be undoing the essence and spirit of the framework of the Constitution, Dhankhar said while speaking at the national conference of chairpersons of state public service commissions in Bengaluru.Terming the trend of post retirement recruitment ""a problem"", he said in some states it has come to be that employees never retire. ""Particularly those in the premium services, they get a number of nomenclatures, this is not good... Any largesse of this kind is antithetical to what was visualised by framers of the Constitution,"" he said.On the issue of paper leaks , Dhankhar said the public service commissions need to curb ""this menace"", which has become an industry. He added that now young applicants have two fears - one is fear of examination and the second, fear of leakage of question papers.Dhankhar also raised concerns over the divisive and polarised political climate calling it far more ""dangerous than climate change"". He added that if bureaucracy gets ingratiated with a particular dispensation, or emasculated, the nation pays a huge price.",Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar flagged concerns over hiring of retired persons and the trend of govt officials getting extensions in service or a particular post.

IMPHAL: A temporary camp of Assam Rifles was set ablaze in Hongbei village of Manipur's Kamjong district Saturday during protests over what residents described as ""continuous frisking"" and harassment along Imphal-Myanmar road. The paramilitary force conducts counter-insurgency operations in the Northeast and guards the India-Myanmar border .The situation escalated when AR personnel allegedly stopped the transport of timber meant for house construction in a nearby village. Local MLA Leishiyo Keishing, who was present after attending a wedding, intervened. He requested AR to allow the timber transportation. His plea was dismissed. Sources said the residents, including women, gathered in large numbers to demand an end to the frisking operations and the removal of AR personnel from the area inhabited by the Tangkhul Naga community.The protest turned violent when the paramilitary troopers allegedly fired air shots and tear gas shells to disperse the crowd, further enraging the locals. The protesters then destroyed the temporary camp, insisting on the immediate withdrawal of the forces. Kamjong SP Ningsem Vashum confirmed the heightened tensions, saying residents from neighbouring villages had blocked roads to prevent reinforcements from reaching the area.","Assam Rifles camp set ablaze in Manipur's Kamjong district.

RAIPUR: Two labourers died and six were grievously injured when a high-rise iron-casting structure collapsed at a construction site in Raipur Saturday. Two of the injured were in critical condition.The accident came just two days after a silo collapsed at a smelting plant in Mungeli district. The bodies of an engineer and two more workers were recovered on Saturday from the debris of the silo after a 40-hour rescue operation, taking the death toll in the tragedy to four.Raipur collector Gaurav Singh said the accident occurred at the construction site for a residential complex on VIP Road.

Gujarat village shuns kites to let painted storks soar safely,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarat-village-shuns-kites-to-let-painted-storks-soar-safely/articleshow/117159067.cms,"Photo/BCCL

VADODARA: For 16-year-old Mayur Chauhan, Uttarayan is more than just a celebration - it is a tradition inalienable with kite flying. He and his friends used to begin preparations at least 10 days before Jan 14, and by the festival's peak, the skies above his native village Luna, 20 km from Vadodara, would be a battlefield of soaring kites and playful rivalries.Four years ago, however, everything changed when painted storks , which frequented the village in winters, found Luna as their haven. Now, kites no longer clash in the skies here, and jubilant screams of 'kaipo che' (I've cut your kite) have fallen silent. Not just Mayur and his friends, but the majority of villagers have grounded their kites lest the sharp strings slice the delicate necks of painted storks.For Luna, the painted storks are not just feathered visitors - they are family whom the residents fiercely protect. This village with a 2,000-strong population hosts over 300 painted storks every winter. ""I'm passionate about flying kites, but for the last two years, I haven't flown one. I do climb the terrace during Uttarayan, but just to keep an eye on the storks and see to it that the kites don't disturb them,"" said Mayur.Few villagers who can't resist flying kites do so at noon, when the birds usually rest in their nests. The storks have been staying on the trees around a pond in the village for decades, but earlier the residents were not aware of this bird. ""About 10 years ago, we started organising awareness programmes about painted storks in the village and explained to people how we should conserve these birds,"" said Pravin Arya, who runs Society for Jeevrakshak for Animals with his son Rupesh.The villagers soon developed a close bond with the storks, and started looking after them.""About three years ago, a group of men used to sneak into the village at night and hunt the storks for meat. When the villagers got a whiff of it, they formed teams and started night patrolling in areas where the storks nest. Eventually, the hunting stopped,"" said Arya.","The skies above Luna, 20 km from Vadodara, used to be a battlefield of soaring kites and playful rivalries.

Incensed parents claimed that the principal disapproved of the students having written on each other's shirts on the last day of their pre-board exams on Thursday (Jan 9) and asked them to remove the same. The girls went home wearing only their blazers with no shirt underneath.The accused principal, meanwhile, refuted the allegations saying she had just ordered the students to take off their shirts before going home. ""I didn't ask them to open their shirts and go. I told them to go in proper uniform only and not to linger around,"" she told reporters on Saturday.The DC said she spoke to the parents and students about the issue. ""It's a matter of serious concern. Based on the findings and the probe report, action will be taken. If needed, an FIR would be lodged,"" she said, adding that the committee, headed by sub-divisional magistrate Rajesh Kumar, had already launched an investigation.""We are interrogating some of the staff members and teachers of the school who were present at the time of the incident.

AGRA: Juna akhara , the largest Hindu monastic order in India, has expelled mahant Kaushal Giri for seven years after he accepted a 13-year-old girl as ""donation"" from her family and initiated her as a sadhvi (monk) before the Kumbh Mela 's first bathing ritual. The akhara's senior office bearers said the girl was returned to her family in Agra on Friday evening and they have now set a minimum age limit of 22 years for initiating women as sanyasins.Giri, however, claimed that the girl's father willingly offered his daughter to the Akhara, citing her desire to renounce worldly life. ""Her parents had no objections. After completing the Dharmadhwaja and Pindadaana rituals, she would formally embrace sainthood,"" Giri said.The incident sparked objections from top saints and a meeting of senior Akhara officials, including patron saint Srimahant Giri, spokesperson Narayan Giri, fair in-charge Mohan Bharti, and others, was convened to address the issue. They unanimously decided to expel Giri for violating ""ethical and legal"" norms.""The girl is a minor, and this was unacceptable. We decided that she should be sent back home. While we will adopt an abandoned infant if found, we will not induct women under 22 years of age under normal circumstances. The age limit ensures that a girl seeking sainthood is mature enough to make an informed decision. Children cannot be housed in our camps, and we have requested the authorities concerned to intervene and ensure such incidents do not happen again,"" spokesperson Narayan Giri said.An Akhada official said that according to the rules, a minor's parents must first provide an initial consent document for her to become a sanyasin. After six months, a final consent document is required, along with the minor's consent, to ensure that the decision is not made impulsively or in anger.The girl's father, who owns a sweets shop in Agra, brought her and her sister to Prayagraj on Dec 26, where they assisted in camp services under Giri's guidance at the Juna Akhara camp in Sector 20. Their relatives said their devotion to Giri began over three years ago, and they trusted him completely.The girl's mother, a housemaker, said their association with Giri started when he conducted religious discourses at the Kali Maa temple in their village. ""His narration of the Bhagavad Gita influenced us deeply, and we decided to attend the Maha Kumbh because of our devotion to him,"" she said.However, the girl's grandfather, 65-year-old Rohtan Singh Dhakre, opposed the decision. ""She is not of appropriate age for this. We were unaware of her joining the Akhara and only found out when the media came to our home,"" he said. Her grandmother, Radha Devi, added, ""She does not live with us, so we were not informed.""Child rights activist Naresh Paras also condemned the incident, labelling a violation of the Juvenile Justice Act . ""A child is not a commodity to be donated. Every child aged six to 14 is entitled to free and compulsory education under the Right to Education Act. This action breaches her fundamental rights,"" Paras said.Paras has written to the chief justice of the Allahabad high court and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), urging immediate intervention. He added that no Akhara is authorised to accept minors, as they are neither registered educational institutions nor compliant with child protection laws. ""If a child is left by their parents, they must be produced before the child welfare committee. The consent of a minor is legally invalid,"" he said."," mahant Kaushal Giri accepted 13-year-old girl as ""donation"" from her family.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar dismissed speculation of a power tussle within the Congress-led government, firmly stating that he and chief minister Siddaramaiah will continue in their respective roles for the full five-year term. Speaking on Saturday, Shivakumar said that the Congress party 's directives would guide their actions, and he sought to quash rumours of leadership changes.""No one should worry; there is no need for any political turn. People have blessed us and given us an opportunity, and we will continue for five years,"" Shivakumar told reporters, as reported by news agency PTI>Addressing supporters who hailed him as the “next chief minister,” he added, ""I don't want anyone to demand anything from me; I don't want anyone's support. I do not need any legislator's backing. This is between me and the Congress party. Whatever the Congress party says, I will function accordingly. I don't want workers or legislators to shout for me or stand in my support. I will do my duty.""Shivakumar's remarks came amidst ongoing speculation about a ""rotational chief minister"" formula, allegedly agreed upon after the May 2023 Assembly elections. Reports at the time suggested that Shivakumar, a Vokkaliga leader and state Congress President, would take over as chief minister halfway through the government's term. However, the party has never officially confirmed such an arrangement.The speculation gained momentum after a dinner hosted by Siddaramaiah with Dalit and Scheduled Tribe ministers, leading to conjecture about possible leadership changes. Shivakumar brushed aside these reports, reiterating his commitment to the party's high command and his faith in the philosophy of ""Karmanye vadhikaraste ma phaleshu kadachana"" – a belief in performing one's duty without expecting results.His statements follow comments by Cabinet colleague KN Rajanna, a Siddaramaiah loyalist, who suggested Shivakumar focus on leading the Congress to victory in the next elections and serving as chief minister for a full term instead of aiming for the position during the current government’s tenure.

Kamala Harris: Did Kamala Harris 'crop out' Donald Trump from Jimmy Carter's funeral photo?

Kamala Harris' sigh and eye-roll

Amid a lot of teas from who did what at Jimmy Carter's funeral service which saw a stellar gathering of five presidents -- Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Donald Trump, Kamala Harris cropped Donald Trump out of the photo that she posted on the Instagram account of the Vice President.""President Jimmy Carter loved our country. He lived his faith, served the people, and left the world better than he found it.

""This crop is legendary,"" another commented. ""This pillar is doing the Lord's work,"" another wrote referring to how Donald Trump got blocked by the pillar. ""She really said 'Trump ain't getting on MY VP feed',"" another wrote. It obviously can't be confirmed whether Kamala Harris cropped the photo but it's certain that she chose a photo that did not have Donald Trump in it.Throughout the service, Kamala Harris was very expressive as she did not pretend to be stoic and to ignore everything happening around her. When Donald Trump and Barack Obama engaged in a conversation that even saw Obama laughing, Kamala Harris turned back to find out what was so funny and then she looked forward with a sigh and apparently an eye roll. When Jill Biden came and took the seat beside her, she picked the pocketbook from her seat and handed it over to her without exchanging any glance.While the tension between Kamala Harris and Jill Biden was palpable like many other previous gatherings, Kamala Harris did not acknowledge either Donald Trump or Melania -- in her first face-to-face meeting with Trump since the election.",Kamala Harris cropped Donald Trump out of the photo that she posted of Jimmy Carter's funeral on her VP social media accounts.

Who is Doug Ford? Canadian official laughs off Trump’s Canada takeover idea: 'How about we buy two American states?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-doug-ford-canadian-official-laughs-off-trumps-canada-takeover-idea-how-about-we-buy-two-american-states/articleshow/117057599.cms,"Ford’s remarks were in response to Trump’s renewed push for unification with Canada.

Ford’s fiery history of defiance

Trudeau’s take: A snowball’s chance in hell

Trump’s grand vision

Ontario Premier Doug Ford has never been one to shy away from a confrontation, but his latest sparring match with former US President Donald Trump has taken the Canada-US dynamic into uncharted territory. At a press conference on Monday, Ford fired back at Trump’s provocative suggestion that Canada should become the 51st state, offering a counterproposal that caught everyone off guard.“To the president, I’ll make him a counteroffer,” Ford said, visibly irritated by the question. “How about if we buy Alaska? And we’ll throw in Minnesota and Minneapolis at the same time? You know, it’s not realistic.”Ford’s remarks were in response to Trump’s renewed push for unification with Canada, which the former president claimed would benefit both nations economically and militarily. Ford, however, was having none of it.“He may be joking, but under my watch, that will never, ever happen,” Ford declared, emphasizing his commitment to protecting Canadian sovereignty .This isn’t the first time Ford has locked horns with Trump. In 2024, the Ontario Premier threatened to cut off electricity exports to over a million Americans and ban American-made beer in retaliation for Trump’s proposed 25% tariffs on Canadian goods.“If they come at us, we have to stand up for Canadians,” Ford said at the time. “It would cut off the lights to a million-and-a-half Americans.”Canada is the largest exporter of energy to the US, with states like Michigan and New York heavily reliant on Ontario’s electricity. Ford’s bold threats underscored the delicate interdependence between the two nations.Outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also weighed in on Trump’s 51st state proposal. In a fiery post on X (formerly Twitter), Trudeau dismissed the idea outright:“There isn’t a snowball’s chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States,” he wrote. “Workers and communities in both our countries benefit from being each other’s biggest trading and security partner.”Trudeau’s rebuttal came as Trump ramped up his rhetoric on Truth Social, claiming that many Canadians “LOVE being the 51st state” and that merging the two nations would eliminate tariffs and bolster security against Russia and China.Trump’s ambitions don’t stop at Canada. The president-elect has also revived his interest in purchasing Greenland, a move he first floated during his previous term. On Monday, he posted a meme on Truth Social showing a map of North America with both Canada and Greenland covered in the American flag, captioned “Oh, Canada!”“We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside World. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!” Trump proclaimed, while his son, Donald Trump Jr., toured Greenland wearing a MAGA hat.","Ontario Premier Doug Ford has never been one to shy away from a confrontation, but his latest sparring match with former US President Donald Trump has taken the Canada-US dynamic into uncharted territory.

As Meghan Markle and Harry drew flak for visiting an evacuation center at Pasadena, mayor Victor Gordo said no one knew Harry and Meghan were serving food there. ""They were serving food anonymously. No one knew they were serving food.-- with masks. They didn't come out here for publicity. They came out to work,"" Victor Gordo said calling them ""great people, great personalities, great heart"".""They really buoyed the spirit of the first responders.

Their critics said they manage to make every tragedy about themselves as there was no need to issue a statement on California wildfires as they do not represent the royals.Many social media users, mostly Meghan-haters, claimed that it was a PR stunt and there were cameras with them and the media was also informed. One viral X post claimed that the woman whom Meghan Markle was hugging with teary eyes was seen later with Meghan Markle hinting that probably she was a team member.Social media accounts sympathizing with Meghan Markle said she is a free citizen and can go anywhere she wants.

BREAKING: Jack Smith resigns from DOJ

Jack Smith, a former war crimes prosecutor and special counsel, who led two federal prosecutions against President-elect Donald Trump, has resigned.According to a news report by The New York Times, his departure was announced in a legal filing submitted to Judge Aileen Cannon. The filing noted that Smith completed his final confidential report on January 7, 2025, and officially left his role on January 10.Smith faced numerous legal setbacks, including rulings against him by appellate courts, the Supreme Court, and Judge Aileen Cannon. His resignation was expected before Trump’s inauguration, following the submission of his final report earlier this month.Smith was appointed to investigate Trump in cases that garnered national attention. Both prosecutions, however, ended in legal defeats, with appellate courts and the Supreme Court siding against him.Smith's final week underscored the challenges of his tenure, including a ruling by Judge Cannon temporarily blocking the public release of his final report on the Florida documents case.Trump's attorneys contended that Smith lacked the legal authority to submit the classified documents report, claiming his appointment was unconstitutional and driven by political bias.Smith’s cases against the president-elect were closed last year after Trump’s victory in the presidential election. Prosecutors cited justice department regulations, which prohibit the prosecution of a sitting president, as the reason for the closure.Trump had openly criticised Smith during the investigations, vowing to remove him from his role upon assuming office. Smith’s resignation was anticipated, as he had indicated his intent to leave before Trump’s inauguration.","Jack Smith, a former war crimes prosecutor and special counsel, led two federal prosecutions against President-elect Donald Trump.

X 'incompatible' with fundamental values

Berlin mulling a departure

Loudspeaker for Musk

Scores of universities and research institutions in Germany and Austria on Friday announced their intention to drop their presence on the online messaging platform X (formerly Twitter), saying its algorithms were opposed to a discourse based on scientific and democratic integrity.The planned withdrawal in the academic sphere comes as the German government says it is also considering leaving the platform because it was having an ""agitated and polarizing"" effect on public political discussion.On Thursday, the trade unions GEW, which represents educators and teachers, and Verdi announced they were deleting their X presence, as did the Federal Court of Justice (BGH).In a statement, the institutions, which include some of Germany's most prestigious universities, said that X was steering a course that went against their principles.""The withdrawal is a consequence of the incompatability of the platform's current orientation with the fundamental values of the institutions involved: open-mindedness, scientific integrity, transparency and democratic discourse,"" a joint statement said.It said the way X's algorithm reinforced the propagation of right-wing populist content while restricting other views made any further use of the platform by the signees ""untenable.""The German government, in its turn, said on Friday that X and other social media platforms used algorithms that do not foster ""a calm, objective and balanced discourse, but rather one that tends to be agitated and polarising.""A spokeswoman said the government was holding an ongoing discussion on whether to leave the platform but had decided to remain for the time being in view of the wide audience that could be reached via its services.She denied that the government's concerns about X were linked to owner Elon Musk 's involvement in German politics .Musk has given vocal support to the German far-right party Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) via his platform, something that has caused concern to several politicians in Germany ahead of February elections.The comments come a day after Musk held live talks on the platform with Alice Weidel, the leader of the AfD.Musk has used X to call on German voters to choose the AfD at upcoming elections and to criticise several leading German politicians, including Chancellor Olaf Scholz and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.He has also taken particular interest in the Labour government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer in the UK of late, repeatedly calling on him to resign.Critics also say the platform is failing to remove disinformation and hate speech.The European Commission is currently examining whether Musk, a supporter of US President-elect Donald Trump, is adhering to the rules for social media networks that are in force in Europe.","Universities and research institutions in Germany and Austria say they will drop their presence on the online messaging platform X.

BREAKING: President-Elect Trump And Melania Visit Capitol Rotunda Where Jimmy Carter Lies In State

A funeral steeped in fashion, tension, and political drama

Melania Trump has made her return to Washington DC, but it wasn’t just her presence at the funeral of former president Jimmy Carter that caught attention—her outfit became the talk of the town.The 54-year-old former First Lady , joined by her husband, President-elect Donald Trump , was seen attending the National Cathedral service Thursday morning. As the couple sat in the front row, all eyes weren’t just on the ceremonial proceedings, but on Melania’s striking outfit.The ex-beauty queen chose a long-sleeve Valentino black coat dress with an oversized white collar, paired with a dramatic print of a 19th-century neoclassical sculpture of lovers sharing an intimate kiss. While the dress itself was a statement, it quickly became the center of heated discussions on social media.Some took to X (formerly Twitter) to share their harsh opinions. “WTF is Melania wearing? Did the nun store have a sale?” one person posted, comparing her to a “nun.” Another mocked the ensemble, calling it a “pilgrim outfit,” referencing the dress’s exaggerated collar. The critiques only escalated, with one user adding, “Looks like our next four years of ‘What the f--- is Melania wearing?’ starts today.”But the fashion criticisms didn’t end with the former First Lady’s attire. Her reappearance also saw her catch the eye of former Vice President Mike Pence’s wife, Karen Pence, who appeared to avoid any interaction with either Donald or Melania. Mike Pence, however, shook hands with both, despite his recent vocal criticism of Trump in his memoir, So Help Me God.Not just Melania, but the entire event became a spectacle of political tension. As President-elect Trump and Barack Obama were seen chatting amicably, viewers couldn’t help but wonder what was being discussed behind the scenes. But it was Melania’s fashion choice and the stark dynamics between former political allies that kept the audience intrigued.In a moment of unusual tension, Kamala Harris—seated just in front of the Trumps—arrived and deliberately avoided making eye contact with Donald Trump. “Kamala arrived, Trump kept staring at her, she wouldn’t look at him,” one social media user noted.For Trump, the funeral was a chance to pay his respects to Carter, but his usual political posturing continued. Just days before the service, he had taken a swipe at the late president's controversial decision to relinquish control of the Panama Canal to Panama. “Jimmy Carter gave it to them for $1, and they were supposed to treat us well,” Trump had said in a news conference. ""It was the most expensive structure ever built in the history of our country.""While the day was meant to honor a former president, it became a moment filled with political undercurrents and fashion-focused commentary. Melania Trump, typically known for her sharp style, once again found herself at the center of a cultural conversation—this time not for a diplomatic or fashion-forward choice, but for a polarizing outfit that turned heads for all the wrong reasons.",Melania Trump's outfit at Jimmy Carter's funeral became the talk of the town.

US will get first female president in my lifetime, says Lara Trump



Donald Trump's daughter-in-law who played a major role in his re-election and is now readying for a greater role said women should trust the incoming president because Trump cares about women irrespective of their background, and religion and she is an embodiment of Trump's commitment to women's empowerment. In an exclusive interview to New York Post, Eric Trump's wife and former RNC co-chair Lara said Trump helped her to get where she is today. Be it his chief of staff Susie Wiles, press secretary Karoline Leavitt, cabinet picks like Kristi Noem and Linda McMahon, and attorney Alina Habba, Trump surrounds himself with strong women.“I think that’s what people who get to know Donald Trump appreciate: He doesn’t care what you look like, he doesn’t care about your religion, he doesn’t care about your gender, he doesn’t care who you love.""“He cares about whether or not you are going to be able to perform a job to your best ability,” Lara said. “It’s something I appreciate as a woman because I never want someone to give me a job because of my gender.”Lara is not from a business family like the Trumps and she did not even know much about the Trump family before she met Eric as part of her job as a story coordinator and producer for the TV Show “Inside Edition,” where she worked from 2012 to 2016. The couple married in 2014 and are now parents to Luke and Carolina.Lara Trump said she believes that the US will see a female president in her lifetime but gender can't be the deciding factor. ""I actually believe our first female president will be a Republican,"" Lara said.“Hillary Clinton tried to tell everyone that they should vote for her because she was a woman: ‘Don’t you want to see a woman as president?'” Lara said. “There are a lot of women I can think of right now who I would consider voting for for president.

'They are merely two nitwit celebrities'

As Meghan Markle and Prince Harry went to the Pasadena Convention Center Friday to meet the victims of the Eaton fire and the first responders in their latest attempt to stand by the people in the moment of distress, social media users asked they behave like royals even after stepping down from royal duties. According to reports, it was not a planned press visit and they wanted to meet the victims without creating any ripple in the media, but videos of their visit are all over social media.One report said they were serving food at the evacuation center anonymously but on Friday they took time to meet those who were affected.Both of them wore hats apparently to keep a low profile -- with their face not fully revealing. Meghan wore baseball hats and Harry chose a black Cali hat. They were seen speaking to the mayor in one video; and to a woman in another video. Meghan was seen teary-eyed hugging a woman in a viral photo.New York Post reported that the Duke and Duchess were focused on supporting and helping both physically and emotionally without causing chaos. The pair began their visit by serving meals alongside volunteers from chef Jose Andrés’ World Central Kitchen (WCK) outside the Convention Center, accompanied by the First Partner of California, Jennifer Siebel Newsom. Meghan and Harry later returned to the Pasadena Convention Center to meet with José Andrés, whose World Central Kitchen has been providing food to fire victims and first responders at pop-up food stations around LA County.Harry-Meghan haters who are not few in numbers on social media asked why they went to the centers behaving like they were still royals. ""Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, always willing to exploit a tragedy to promote themselves. It’s disgusting. And her and Harry’s attempts to still act like royals is appalling. They are merely two nitwit celebrities with a failing brand, and yet the mayor of Pasadena and Gavin Newsom’s wife are with them. Why? They offer nothing. They both need to get it through their thick heads that THEY ARE NOT ROYALS HERE. Just donate, maybe volunteer, but stop acting like you’re anything else. Royals represent their people and government, the cosplay royals represent nothing but their own greed. I’m sure Meghan is also panicking that her show and triumphant return will be wrecked by Mother Nature,"" one post read.Another claimed that Meghan actually got distracted while talking to a fire victim because ""she is looking for her next photo op moment"".Mayor Gordo said Harry and Meghan did not come out for publicity and genuinely came to work.","Meghan Markle and Prince Harry went to the Pasadena Convention Center Friday to meet the victims of the Eaton fire and the first responders.

Hollywood Sign Under Threat! Sunset Fire Endangers Iconic LA Landmarks | WATCH

Firefighters in Los Angeles are racing to contain wildfires that have devastated the region and displaced thousands as Santa Ana winds, infamous for turning fires into uncontrollable infernos, are expected to return, the National Weather Service warned.According to a report by the Associated Press, crews focused their efforts on the Palisades Fire in Mandeville Canyon, home to Arnold Schwarzenegger and other celebrities where helicopters dropped water to prevent flames from reaching the Getty Museum and UCLA. Ground teams worked tirelessly, using hoses to combat leaping flames on smoke-covered hillsides.County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath described the nights as ""unimaginable terror,"" with many more residents forced to evacuate due to the northeast expansion of the Palisades Fire, reported AP.At a briefing, CalFire Operations Chief Christian Litz said a main focus Saturday was the Palisades Fire burning in the canyon area, not far from the UCLA campus.“We need to be aggressive out there,” Litz said, according to AP.Over 56 square miles have burned, destroying 12,000 structures, including homes, schools, and historic landmarks.Recovery teams are also working to locate victims. Eleven fatalities have been confirmed so far, with cadaver dogs continuing searches in destroyed neighbourhoods. Survivors returned to sift through the ruins of their homes, salvaging keepsakes amidst heartbreak.“We have people driving up and around trying to get in just to look. Stay away,”AP quoted Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna as saying.The crisis has raised questions about leadership and resources. Fire Chief Kristin Crowley criticised city authorities for underfunding firefighting efforts and failing to maintain water supplies for hydrants. Governor Gavin Newsom has ordered an investigation into these failures.Amidst the devastation, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle visited evacuees, distributing food and offering support. Meanwhile, Disney pledged $15 million to assist in recovery efforts.","Over 56 square miles have burned, destroying 12,000 structures, including homes, schools, and historic landmarks.

Investigating the cause:

The mammoth Palisades fire was roaring closer to residential areas of Los Angeles early Saturday, forcing a new round of evacuation orders and dimming hopes that a brief drop in wind speeds would help firefighters tame Southern California's devastating blazes.The desert winds that have stoked the fires were expected to pick up again Saturday afternoon. But even without high winds, the most destructive wildfires in Los Angeles' history expanded overnight across the region's bone-dry terrain.The Palisades fire, the largest of them, tore east, chewing up parched vegetation as it raced up the ridges of Mandeville Canyon. Authorities issued mandatory evacuation orders for an area including parts of the Brentwood and Encino neighborhoods, as well as the Getty Center, one of Southern California's cultural jewels.The blaze, which has burned through 21,600 acres and razed stretches between Santa Monica and Malibu since it broke out Tuesday, was only 8% contained, according to Cal Fire. To the east, firefighters had contained 3% of the 14,000-acre Eaton fire, near Altadena and Pasadena. The blazes, which have killed at least 11 people and destroyed thousands of structures, now rank among the five most damaging in California's history.With many people still unaccounted for, officials have said the death toll could rise.Los Angeles announced a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. for areas under mandatory evacuation orders. National Guard units have been deployed to secure evacuation zones.Here's what we're covering:--After reports emerged that a critical reservoir was offline when the fires started, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he was ordering an independent review to determine why firefighters ran out of water early on, calling the situation ""deeply troubling.""--Those who have died include a man in his 60s who lived in his childhood home and drove a bloodmobile; a retired aerospace engineer and an active church deacon; and a retired pharmacy technician whom neighbors called ""an angel.""--The combined area burned by this past week's fires is larger than the city limits of San Francisco, Pittsburgh, Boston or Miami. As of Saturday morning, more than 100,000 people were under evacuation orders, and some 160,000 electricity customers were without power.--Los Angeles County emergency management officials said that an erroneous evacuation alert that was transmitted this past week went out to nearly 10 million residents, or roughly the county's entire population. The fires' effects on cellphone towers could have caused the problem, the officials said, calling the error a ""serious breach of public trust.""--It is not clear what ignited the fires, and investigators will most likely take months to come to any firm conclusions. But power lines near the Eaton and Palisades fires were on when those blazes erupted Tuesday. Energy experts said that was concerning because electrical equipment has often ignited infernos during periods of high wind in California and elsewhere.","The Palisades fire, the largest of them, tore east, chewing up parched vegetation as it raced up the ridges of Mandeville Canyon.

Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently in Adiala Jail , demanded a transparent investigation and the establishment of a judicial commission to examine violence on November 26 and May 9. He communicated this demand to lawyers and media during a meeting at the jail.Regarding ongoing negotiations in the country, Khan expressed skepticism, stating, ""The government's non-serious attitude towards negotiations is evident from the fact that I haven't even been allowed to meet with my negotiation committee yet. It seems like the purpose of negotiations is merely to waste time so that public reaction over the November 26th Islamabad massacre starts to fade.""Khan called for an impartial judicial commission to investigate the incidents, particularly the November 26 event. ""Peaceful citizens were massacred on November 26th; they were directly shot at, and D-Chowk was drenched in their blood. Many of our people are still missing. In any civilized society, those responsible for such shootings would have been held accountable, but this government has not even managed to form a judicial commission yet. A judicial commission acts as a (neutral) third umpire. Only an impartial commission can provide justice to the martyrs of November 26th (2024) and May 9th (2023). If this massacre is swept under the rug, no one’s life or property in Pakistan will be safe,"" he said.He also alleged mistreatment of PTI members in custody and called for these claims to be raised internationally. ""While in military custody, our innocent people were subjected to severe mental and physical torture. According to my information, three young men attempted suicide during custody. Sami Wazir’s condition is a stark testament to this brutality. What happened to PTI leaders like Shahbaz Gill and Azam Swati is no secret. Zille Shah was brutally murdered, and Intezar Panjutha was treated worse than animals. What kind of justice is this? Those who leave PTI are absolved of any charges related to May 9th, while those who refuse are subjected to all kinds of torture and pressure,"" Khan stated.Further threatening to take the alleges injustice to global forums, the ex-Pakistan PM added, ""We haven't obtained justice despite repeatedly appealing to Pakistan’s judicial system, leaving us with no choice but to raise our voice on international forums. Pakistan’s government is bound by international laws and treaties regarding human rights. I have instructed our lawyers to take these matters to global forums and draw the world’s attention to the ongoing human rights violations in Pakistan.""In connection to the May 9 case, Imran Khan has approached the Lahore High Court for bail, according to ARY News. The case is centred around severe unrest across Pakistan following Imran Khan's arrest on May 9, 2023. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters demonstrated their outrage through widespread protests in both rural and urban areas, prompting authorities to deploy military forces in Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Islamabad to maintain security. During these demonstrations, PTI supporters targeted military facilities, including an assault on the Corps Commander's residence in Lahore. Subsequently, Imran Khan was named as the primary accused in the legal proceedings. The November 26 protests were also centred on similar demands with PTI members demanding release of their leader.Khan also addressed the people of Pakistan saying, ""My message to overseas Pakistanis is that democracy and human rights have been obliterated in Pakistan, to be replaced by the law of the jungle. Your boycott of foreign currency remittances is critical. Your loved ones in Pakistan deserve the same rights that you enjoy abroad.""Khan also talked about the fake allegations and cases against him while putting forward the demand for transparent investigation and justice. ""Our government was falsely accused of resettling the Taliban. Terrorism did not resurface during our tenure, and even a year after it ended. The same people who are responsible for conditions in Balochistan are also responsible for the current chaos,"" he said adding, "" No leader in Pakistan’s history has ever faced 280 cases. This kind of treatment was only meted out to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during General Yahya's rule, and now it is being done to me.""Additionally, citing a World Bank report, Khan expressed concern about rising poverty and the impact of political instability on the economy. ""according to a recent World Bank report, an additional 13 million people have fallen below the poverty line. Every institution, including the judiciary, NAB, FIA, and police, have been tasked to work against PTI, causing political and economic systems to collapse and instability to reach its peak. Economic growth will remain zero as long as political instability persists. All of this is being done to bolster the plan for a decade-long dictatorship. Anyone who supports this lawlessness can have their corruption of billions pardoned.""According to PTI, Khan has been imprisoned for over 520 days.",Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan is currently in Adiala Jail.
