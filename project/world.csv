Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari: Bangladesh monk who’s sparked calls for a ban on Iskcon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chinmoy-krishna-das-brahmachari-bangladesh-monk-whos-sparked-calls-for-a-ban-on-iskcon/articleshow/115787770.cms,"Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, also known as Krishna Das Prabhu, is an ISKCON monk and Hindu leader who was recently arrested in Bangladesh for leading protests against violence towards Hindus. His detention has raised global concerns about the safety of Hindus in Bangladesh and freedom of peaceful assembly.

A popular preacher who began young

Arrested on sedition charges

A worrisome trend

Attacks against the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh following the ouster of PM Sheikh Hasina in Aug this year have sparked widespread concern and caused a wrinkle in New Delhi’s ties with Dhaka. Monk Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, who was associated with Gaudiya Vaishnav organisation Iskcon’s Bangladesh chapter before being expelled in Oct this year for violating its rules, emerged as an outspoken critic of the persecution of minorities in the neighbouring country. Violence during protests over his arrest on sedition charges drew a sharp reaction from the Indian govt and triggered calls in Bangladesh for a ban on Iskcon with the interim govt in Dhaka saying it was treating the matter seriously.Das hails from Satkania Upazila in Chittagong. From 2016 to 2022, he was the Chittagong divisional secretary of Iskcon. He gained popularity at an early age for his religious speeches and earned the nickname of ‘Shishu Bokta’, or ‘child orator’, reports Bangladeshi media.He’s a spokesperson for the Bangladesh Sammilito Sanatani Jagaran Jot, a minority Hindu body. Following the Aug 5 overthrow of the Awami League govt — it is seen as having opened up space for the revival of right-wing outfits — Das has campaigned against targeted attacks on Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh.Das is reportedly facing a sedition case for disrespecting the Bangladeshi flag during a rally in Oct. He was arrested with 18 others for allegedly hoisting a saffron flag above Bangladesh’s national flag in Chittagong on Oct 25. That led to a complaint of “desecration” of and “contempt for the country’s sovereignty”. Complainant Md Feroze Khan claimed the accused en gaged in “activities aimed at destabilising the nation by fostering an anarchic environment”.Das was arrested on Nov 25 from Dhaka airport while waiting to board a flight to Chittagong. Earlier, on Nov 22, he had addressed a large rally in Rangpur against attacks on Hindus. His detention sparked protests among Hindus in Bangladesh and, on Nov 26, New Delhi and Dhaka had a sharp exchange after communal tensions flared up in Chittagong — which left one person dead — following a court’s denial of bail to Das. Iskcon In Crosshairs, Too The violence in Chittagong prompted the interim govt to say it would determine whether action should be taken over the episode. Additionally, a Bangladesh Supreme Court lawyer brought a petition seeking a ban on Iskcon, alleging it to be a fundamentalist organisation. While Iskcon rejected those claims, reports on Thursday said the high court in Dhaka had refused to ban the organisation’s Bangladesh chapter.The plea for a ban on Iskcon was backed by powerful students’ groups, a prominent voice in Bangladesh since their successful movement to topple the govt of Sheikh Hasina.However, reports said that the rightwing BNP, the party of former PM Khaleda Zia, called for a ‘fair and transparent’ probe into the charges against Das after alleging the involvement of vested interests in the matter.While Das’s arrest further threatens to complicate bilateral ties in the wake of the events that unfolded since Aug 5 — New Delhi has flagged its “deep concern” while Dhaka has noted that it was an “internal matter” — senior Iskcon members have demanded the intervention of the Indian and Bangladeshi govts to ensure his immediate release.In a post on X, Iskcon vice president Radharamn Das said, “Mass killing is going on in Hazari Goli, Chittagong. They are branding every Hindu as ‘dalal’ of Iskcon and attacking. I am shocked by the videos I am receiving from the worried congregation in Bangladesh.” Rights & Risks Analysis Group (RRAG), a Delhi-based NGO, has filed a complaint with the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention against the “illegal and arbitrary detention of the most prominent minority Hindu religious monk in Bangladesh”. It said there was no evidence of Sanatani Jot’s Das being involved in the alleged desecration of the Bangladeshi flag and that “the actual alleged offenders were not identified/named”.The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council, an umbrella organisation of minority groups, also denounced Chinmoy Das’s arrest. A report titled ‘100 Days After the Fall of the Authoritarian Regime’ by Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) says “2,010 incidents of communal violence occurred between August 5 and 20” leading to “the death of nine people of a minority community”. It also notes that the influence of religion-based politics is increasing in the country.In the run-up to the US elections, President-elect Donald Trump expressed his concern over rising violence against Bangladeshi Hindus.","Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, also known as Krishna Das Prabhu, is an ISKCON monk and Hindu leader.

Panchsheel murder accused needed money to pay off debt, rent flat for girlfriend: Police

NEW DELHI: Moving away from their initial line of probe, the south Delhi Police claimed Thursday that the 64-year-old businessman, found dead at his Panchsheel Park home,was killed during a robbery attempt. The latest revelation again raised questions about safety and security of senior citizens in the capital. Police arrested a debt-ridden man named Abhay Sikarwar for the crime and claimed to have solved the case. On Wednesday, area DCP Ankit Chauhan had said that the murder was “preplanned and premeditated”. However, one of the police units found evidence to the contrary and tracked down the suspect based on CCTV footage and technical surveillance.Police said Sikarwar was aware of the layout of the house as he had previously worked as a domestic help for a tenant on the third floor of the building four years ago.The intruder believed the businessman, Rohit Kumar Alagh , was living alone. An inquiry revealed that Sikarwar entered the house to steal as he was in acute need of money to pay off a loan and rent a flat for his girlfriend. Police said Sikarwar had planned the crime a few days earlier. On Monday, he entered the house for the theft but the businessman woke up. This led to a scuffle between the two. Sources said Alagh was stabbed at least two dozen times.Police said the accused was identified and apprehended after an intensive analysis of CCTV footage from over 500 cameras. “He entered the house after cutting the net mesh of the window in the kitchen and break ing the glass,” police said.Police received a call from the victim’s younger son at 9.30am on Monday, informing them about the murder. He told them blood was still oozing from his father’s chest. The murder was discovered when the family’s car cleaner arrived to collect the keys and attempted to open the door. When the victim’s younger son, who was in the next room, opened the door to give the keys to the cleaner, he found his father lying on the floor. Alagh’s elder son owns a restaurant in Hauz Khas, while his younger son is a musician.","Rohit Kumar Alagh, 64, was found dead at his Panchsheel Park home on Monday.

DHAKA: Bangladesh high court on Thursday declined to issue a suo motu order banning Iskcon's activities in the country, the decision coming despite a petition by a Supreme Court lawyer and calls from student groups for such action in the wake of clashes that erupted after denial of bail to the organization's ""former"" priest Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, who has emerged as a prominent advocate of rights of Hindus and other minorities in the predominantly Muslim nation.The bench, consisting of Justice Farah Mahbub and Justice Debasish Roy Chowdhury, was informed by the attorney general's office that ""necessary actions"" had already been taken.

KOLKATA: Calling it a “rarest of rare case”, a fasttrack court in Chinsurah in West Bengal on Thursday sentenced seven persons to death in a 2020 murder case, report Dwaipayan Ghosh & Falguni Banerjee. On Oct 11 that year, the criminals killed 23-year-old Bishnu Mal and dismembered his body into six pieces, following animosity created out of a love triangle.What made judge Shibshankar Ghosh describe it a rare case were the photos of Mal’s body being dismembered that the killers clicked on a mobile phone. They then packed the body parts and dumped them in various placesPolice said Mal was in love with a girl and was set to marry her in late Oct 2020. The girl's testimony in the case proved to be the most important for the conviction, special prosecutor Bivas Chatterjee said. The main accused, Bishal Das, and his associates, Ramkrishna Mondal, Raj Kumar Pramanick, Vinod Das, Ratan Bepari, Biplab Biswas, and Rathin Singha, were awarded death sentence.Another accused, Mantu Ghosh, was jailed for seven years for trying to hide the body, Chatterjee added. Das and his associates had abducted the victim on a motorcycle in front of his house. That night, they killed him in a house in Champdani.Initially, cops arrested all the criminals except Bishal. The arrested persons led the police to the dumping spots. However, Mal's head was not found then. About a month later, Bishal was apprehended in a shooting incident in Jibantala in South 24 Parganas. He was taken into custody by Chandernagore police.The plastic-wrapped head was then recovered from a canal in Baidyabati after Bishal was questioned.","A fasttrack court in Chinsurah in West Bengal on Thursday sentenced seven persons to death in a 2020 murder case.

"Corbett forest cameras spying on women, says study; probe ordered",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/corbett-forest-cameras-spying-on-women-says-study-probe-ordered/articleshow/115784378.cms,"Devices like camera traps have curtailed traditional practices, the study said

DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand’s forest department has initiated an investigation after a study by researchers from University of Cambridge claimed that “digital technologies such as camera traps and drones, deployed for tracking wild animals at Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR), are infringing on the privacy and rights of women living in villages and settlements near the forest”.The peer-reviewed research article — ‘Gendered Forests: Digital Surveillance Technologies for Conservation and Gender-environment Relationships’ — by Trishant Simlai and Chris Sandbrook, documents several incidents of privacy violations, including one in which an image of asemi-nude woman relieving herself was “inadvertently” captured by a camera trap.The woman was autistic, came from a marginalised caste group, and was unable to express her experience of being photographed to her family or other women. To make matters worse, young men, who were recently appointed as temporary forest personnel, accessed the photograph and circulated it on local social media groups. In response to this image-based abuse, residents from the woman's village destroyed camera traps in the adjacent forest areas and issued threats to set a forest personnel station ablaze,"" said the research, which was published on Nov 24.It also cited instances where women felt ""watched"" due to camera traps. ""This surveillance has discouraged women from collecting legally permitted forest resources like firewood and grass, as well as non-timber products such as herbs and honey,"" the authors of the research said.The study further said these technologies have curtailed traditional practices such as singing or engaging in loud conversations while navigating forests - behaviours that are not only culturally significant, but also serve as an essential countermeasure to deter attacks by wild animals . ""There is a 'baaghin' (tigress) with cubs in this part of our forest. If we don't sing or talk loudly, there is a chance of her being surprised and attacking us,"" a woman shared during the research conducted by Simlai, who spoke to 270 people in the settlements near Corbett over a period of 14 months in 2019. Incidentally, one woman interviewed during the research has since been killed in a tiger attack.Regarding the wider social implications , Simlai told TOI, ""The forest is a very gendered space where very complex bunch of social interactions happen between women. But camera traps, which are deployed throughout Uttarakhand, not just in CTR, are making women regulate their behaviour in terms of censoring conversations, singing less, or collecting less firewood or timber or forest produce that is around. The absence of consent in deploying these cameras is also a glaring issue that govt must address.""The study examines the dual role of surveillance technologies: while they perpetuate gender-based violence and reinforce patriarchal norms, they can also be repurposed for women's resistance, it noted. ""In one case, a woman led her abusive husband in front of a deployed camera trap with the objective to record domestic violence. She runs to the camera near her house whenever her husband gets drunk and beats her. In this way, she escapes being beaten and can also have proof if things get out of hand. Although such instances of utilising camera traps as tools of reverse surveillance or sousveillance are overshadowed by their role in propagating gendered structural violence, they warrant further investigation,"" the research highlighted.Ranjan Mishra, chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand, said, ""The director of Corbett will investigate the matter, and we will comment only after the probe is complete.""","Uttarakhand's forest department has initiated an investigation after a study by researchers from University of Cambridge.

Widespread impact on energy systems



Russian tactics



Biden's reaction



Russia advances on the ground



Russia unleashed a massive wave of missiles and drone strikes across Ukraine on Thursday, targeting critical power plants and plunging millions into darkness as temperatures hovered around freezing. Ukrainian officials reported major damage in nine regions, with over a million people immediately losing power and many more facing intensified rolling blackouts.Russian President Vladimir Putin said the assault was in retaliation for Ukraine's use of US-supplied ATACMS missiles to strike Russian territory. He warned that future targets could include strikes by hypersonic missiles on ""decision-making centers"" in Kyiv.The attack, one of the largest since March, involved 91 missiles and 97 drones, according to Ukraine’s air force. While Ukrainian defenses intercepted 79 missiles and 35 drones, 12 missiles struck their targets, primarily energy and fuel facilities.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced the strikes as a ""despicable escalation,"" accusing Russia of using cruise missiles equipped with cluster munitions. He urged Western allies to strengthen their support, speaking with Nato secretary general Mark Rutte, British PM Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to coordinate a response.""Now is the time to strengthen our positions — the position of Ukraine and our partners,"" Zelenskyy said in his nightly address.The strikes severely disrupted Ukraine’s already strained energy grid, which has suffered 11 major attacks since March.

We must force him into peace through strength.""Meanwhile, Russian ground forces are reportedly advancing at their fastest pace in two years, with Moscow deploying a hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile earlier this month.","Russian President Vladimir Putin said the assault was in retaliation for Ukraine's use of US-supplied ATACMS missiles to strike Russian territory. Putin warned that future targets could include strikes by hypersonic missiles on ""decision-making centers"" in Kyiv.

Transition of power



US President Joe Biden has called on President-elect Donald Trump to reconsider his proposed tariffs on Canadian, Mexican, and Chinese goods, calling them “counterproductive” as the transition of power moves forward from the Democrats to the Republicans.“I hope he rethinks it. I think it’s a counterproductive thing to do,” Biden told reporters on Thursday in Nantucket, Massachusetts, while on holiday, saying things could become the opposite of the desired goal. He stressed the importance of maintaining strong ties with neighbouring allies, saying, “We’re surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and two allies, Mexico and Canada. The last thing we need to do is begin to screw up those relationships,” he continued.Trump recently announced plans to impose tariffs to pressure Canada and Mexico to improve border security , address immigration issues, and combat drug smuggling and fentanyl exports. In a post on Truth Social, the President-elect proposed 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods, alongside a 10 per cent tariff on Chinese imports.“Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem,” Trump wrote. “Until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!,"" he concluded.Responses from neighboursMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has pushed back strongly against the proposed tariffs, warning of potential countermeasures. “One tariff would be followed by another in response, and so on until we put at risk common businesses,” she said.Despite Trump’s assertion that a recent phone call with Sheinbaum had been “very productive,” the Mexican leader clarified she had not agreed to close the border as Trump claimed. “In our conversation with President Trump, I explained to him the comprehensive strategy that Mexico has followed to address the migration phenomenon, respecting human rights,” she posted on X. She further said that a trade war could be avoided.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau voiced concerns but said that his conversation with Trump was a “good call.” He pointed out that Canada’s measures to address border challenges were different from Mexico's.On Thanksgiving, Biden expressed gratitude for the smooth transition to the incoming administration, saying, “I want to make sure it goes smoothly.” While urging Trump to reconsider the tariff threats , he also discussed foreign policy, including a cease-fire deal between Israel and Lebanon and the release of three Americans from Chinese detention.Regarding Trump’s 10 per cent tariff threat to China, Biden said, Chinese President Xi Jinping ""doesn't want to make a mistake.""“I am not saying he is our best buddy, but he understands what’s at stake,"" he added.Biden noted that illegal border crossings had significantly decreased since Trump’s first term, despite the former president’s continued campaign focus on the issue.","US President Joe Biden has called on President-elect Donald Trump to reconsider his proposed tariffs on Canadian, Mexican, and Chinese goods.

Blasphemy Debate: Why UK PM Keir Starmer is under fire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/blasphemy-debate-why-uk-pm-keir-starmer-is-under-fire/articleshow/115772357.cms,"The Call for Blasphemy Protections



Criticism of Sir Keir Starmer’s Response



Historical Context: The Repeal of Blasphemy Laws



The Risks of Restricting Free Speech



Blasphemy Laws Around the World



A Warning for the Future



The Broader Implications



Christopher Hitchens once warned: “Resist it while you still can, and before the right to complain is taken away from you. The next thing you will be told is that you can’t complain because you’re Islamophobic.” His words, delivered with characteristic urgency, resonate eerily today as Labour MP Tahir Ali ’s call for laws to protect religious texts and figures sparks fresh debates about freedom of expression in the UK.Caught in the crossfire is Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer , whose cautious response to the controversy has drawn ire from critics on all sides. In a political moment that demands clarity and conviction, Starmer’s apparent hesitancy to defend free speech has left many questioning his leadership—and the Labour Party ’s commitment to democratic principles.Ali has stirred controversy by suggesting the introduction of new laws to prohibit the desecration of religious texts and figures associated with the Abrahamic faiths . During a parliamentary session, Ali posed a question to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, asking if the government would consider such measures. This proposal has ignited a debate about the implications for free speech, religious tolerance, and societal cohesion.Ali’s request reflects concerns from some religious communities about the growing instances of perceived disrespect toward sacred beliefs. However, critics argue that such a proposal resembles the now-defunct blasphemy laws that were abolished in the UK in 2008. These laws historically protected Christian doctrines and criminalised dissenting opinions, often at the expense of free expression.The MP’s focus on Abrahamic religions—Islam,Christianity , and Judaism—has raised questions about inclusivity. Observers have pointed out that singling out these faiths could marginalise other religious or secular communities, creating a hierarchy of protections. British Hindus and Sikhs, for instance, might feel excluded, while atheists and free thinkers worry about a potential rollback of freedoms hard-won over centuries.Prime Minister Starmer’s response to Ali’s question—acknowledging the seriousness of desecration but framing it as part of broader efforts to combat hatred—has faced criticism for being non-committal. Many expected a stronger defence of free speech from Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, but his cautious remarks have left critics questioning Labour’s stance on protecting democratic values.Blasphemy laws in the UK date back to the medieval era and were initially designed to shield the Church of England from criticism. Over time, societal shifts and the growing value placed on free expression led to their repeal in 2008. The move was seen as a step forward in promoting a pluralistic society where individuals could challenge ideas without fear of legal repercussions.Ali’s proposal has reignited debates about whether revisiting such laws would undermine this progress. Critics emphasise that a revival could embolden extremism and stifle necessary dialogue in an increasingly diverse society.Across the world, modern blasphemy laws have often been used to suppress dissent. In countries like Pakistan, accusations of blasphemy have led to mob violence, wrongful imprisonments, and even executions. Critics of Ali’s proposal argue that importing similar restrictions into the UK risks enabling sectarian divisions and eroding civil liberties.Britain has already seen incidents of religious extremism linked to perceived blasphemy. A teacher remains in hiding after showing a depiction of the Prophet Muhammad in class, and a 14-year-old autistic boy faced death threats over accidentally dropping a Quran. In both cases, critics assert that the absence of blasphemy laws was vital in preventing further institutional persecution.Blasphemy laws exist in many countries worldwide, often criminalizing speech or actions perceived as disrespectful to religious beliefs. These laws are particularly prevalent in countries across the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa. Nations like Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Nigeria enforce strict blasphemy laws, sometimes imposing severe penalties, including imprisonment, fines, or even the death penalty. Critics argue that such laws are frequently misused to suppress dissent and target religious minorities, fostering discrimination and injustice. Meanwhile, several Western countries, including the UK, have abolished such laws, emphasizing freedom of speech and religion as fundamental rights in modern democracies.Prominent voices like the late Christopher Hitchens warned against the resurgence of blasphemy restrictions, cautioning that they could pave the way for broader curtailments of speech. Hitchens famously urged people to resist such moves, predicting that free expression could soon come under attack under the guise of combating hate.Ali’s proposal highlights broader tensions in modern British society. Balancing respect for religious beliefs with the need to protect freedom of expression is a complex challenge. However, many argue that safeguarding the latter is essential for fostering genuine dialogue and mutual understanding in a diverse democracy. The UK has long prided itself on upholding individual liberties, including the right to criticise or satirise religious and ideological ideas. Introducing laws that curb these freedoms risks setting a precedent that undermines these values and could embolden those seeking to impose more restrictive measures.",Labour MP Tahir Ali has stirred controversy by suggesting the introduction of new laws to prohibit the desecration of religious texts and figures associated with the Abrahamic faiths.

Putin praised Trump as an experienced and intelligent politician but said that "" he is not safe now .""Speaking to reporters after a summit in Kazakhstan on Thursday, Putin said he had been shocked by the way the US election campaign had unfolded. He cited ""the absolutely uncivilised methods used to battle against Trump, up to and including an assassination attempt - and more than once"".""By the way, in my opinion, he is not safe now,"" Putin said.""Unfortunately, in the history of the United States various incidents have happened. I think he (Trump) is intelligent and I hope he's cautious and understands this,"" he added.Earlier this year in July, Trump sustained injuries during an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. In a separate incident in September, authorities charged an individual with attempted assassination after being found with a rifle at one of Trump’s golf properties in Florida.Putin, known for his own extensive security measures, expressed shock not only at these incidents but also at the criticism Trump’s family and children faced from political opponents during the US election campaign.He described such tactics as ""revolting"" and noted that even ""bandits"" in Russia would not employ such methods.Discussing the Biden administration's decision to permit Kyiv to target Russia with Western missiles, which Putin characterised as an escalation in Ukraine, he suggested this could either serve as an opportunity for Trump to reverse or potentially complicate his relationship with Russia.Nevertheless, Putin said that Trump would ""find the solution"" and affirmed Moscow's willingness to engage in dialogue.He also said that Russia would deploy its entire arsenal against Ukraine if the latter obtained nuclear capabilities. Following a New York Times report from the previous week, where unnamed Western officials hinted at President Joe Biden potentially providing Ukraine with nuclear weapons before the conclusion of his term.""If the country which we are essentially at war with now becomes a nuclear power, what do we do? We will use all means of destruction available to Russia,"" Putin said.""If officially someone were to transfer something, then that would mean a violation of all the non-proliferation commitments they have made,"" Putin said.He stated that while it was nearly impossible for Ukraine to develop a nuclear weapon, the country might have the capability to create a ""dirty bomb""- a conventional explosive infused with radioactive material. In such a scenario, he warned, Russia would respond accordingly, he added.","Putin praised Trump as an experienced and intelligent politician but said that "" he is not safe now.""

US Vice President Kamala Harris after failing the presidential election , despite spending almost $2 billion for her campaign should prevent her from seeking future office, a Democratic megadonor said.The vice president's brief campaign exhausted the substantial sum within approximately 100 days, allocating significant portions towards advertising and celebrity-attended functions.While speaking on a Fox News Fox News' Kayleigh McEnany Wednesday, John Morgan said President-elect Donald Trump's youngest son, Barron Trump , is ""smarter"" than anyone in Kamala Harris's campaign team.""It turns out that Baron Trump, who looks like a runway model, was telling his father, you need to go on podcasts, you need to go on Joe Rogan...

The campaign's total advertising costs reached $494 million.Morgan highlighted the substantial commissions and payments involved, suggesting numerous individuals profited significantly from anti-Trump donors.Despite acknowledging Harris' debate performance, Morgan criticised the overall campaign.

ISLAMABAD: A well-known Pakistani journalist, Matiullah Jan, investigating civilian deaths in a recent assault launched by security forces against supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, has been booked in terrorism and narcotics cases in Islamabad on Thursday.Jan was picked up by unknown individuals along with another journalist, Saqib Bashir, late Wednesday night. His family said he was abducted from the parking of a hospital in Islamabad at around 11pm by “unmarked abductors in an unmarked vehicle”. Bashir, who was later released, said they were collecting data from the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) on the casualties after the march when they were taken.The incident took place amid rising tensions in the capital following Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party’s claims that more than 200 of its workers had been killed by security forces during a late Tuesday night operation to disperse Imran’s supporters in the capital. The protesters had gathered to demand the release from jail of Imran Khan and other politicians and workers of his party.On Thursday afternoon, Islamabad police booked Jan with charges related to terrorism, drug-peddling and attacking police. “It is no less than a joke. There is not an iota of truth in these charges,” his lawyer, Imaan Mazari, said.The Committee to Protect Journalists expressed grave alarm over Jan’s “abduction” and demanded on social media that the “authorities must ensure Jan’s safety and immediate release”.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) also demanded Jan’s immediate release and condemned his arrest as part of an authoritarian tactic to silence journalists. “This authoritarian tactic to silence journalists must cease,” the HRCP asserted.","Journalist Matiullah Jan was investigating civilian deaths in a recent assault launched by security forces against supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan.

ISLAMABAD: At least eight supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) were killed and dozens of others injured in Islamabad following what the party said was a sweeping crackdown overnight by security forces to disperse protesters demanding the release of jailed former prime minister and PTI chief Imran Khan Following the crackdown, Imran’s party ended its agitation but Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur addressed a press conference in his province on Wednesday saying the protest would go on. “Until Imran Khan’s call, this sit-in will go on,” he said without elaborating where it would be held. PTI has been in govt in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Thousands of demonstrators, led by Imran’s wife Bushra Bibi, and Gandapur, had gathered in the capital on Tuesday vowing to stage a sit-in until their demands were met, including the release of political prisoners. Khan and many other PTI leaders and workers have been in jail for over a year on charges that they claim are politically motivated.Security forces launched a massive crackdown before midnight Tuesday after failing to stop protesters from marching to D-Chowk, a public square in Islamabad’s high-security red zone. In the evening authorities forced surrounding stores, cafes and markets to shut and then plunged the protest venue into darkness by switching off streetlights. Eyewitnesses said indiscriminate firing and teargas shelling, which started after 11pm and continued for about two hours, forced the PTI supporters, mostly Pashtuns from the northwest, to retreat.PTI claimed eight of its supporters had died in the late-night clashes and “hundreds” more were feared to have been killed. The govt stated three paramilitary troops and one policeman had died since the PTI launched its protest on Sunday. Islamabad’s police chief told media more than 900 people had been arrested in Tuesday’s raid, in which there were dozens of Afghan nationals.Sources at Islamabad’s two public hospitals said five civilians had died of gunshot wounds and dozens had been injured. According to PTI workers, they had picked up three bodies from the protest site.Information minister Attaullah Tarar said the protesters had fled in disarray, leaving behind vehicles, and even their shoes and clothes.PTI said in a post on social media that a “massacre has unfolded in Pakistan at the hands of security forces”. It accused the armed security forces of launching a violent assault on peaceful PTI protesters, firing live rounds with the intent to kill as many people as possible. It went on to compare last night’s clashes to the violence in the then East Pakistan in 1971. “The rulers have learned nothing from history and are prepared to destroy the country to cling to their illegitimate power,” the post stated. “With hundreds dead and countless injured, the interior minister’s threat to kill, and then the declaration of ‘victory’ over slaughtered innocents is enough evidence of the regime’s inhumanity,” it added.On Wednesday morning, the heavily fortified red zone was empty of protesters but dozens of smashed vehicles, including the charred remains of a truck from which Imran’s wife had been leading the protest, portrayed a grim picture.",At least eight supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) were killed and dozens of others injured in Islamabad.

Bushra Bibi , the wife of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan , is leading protests demanding his release from jail. At least five people have died in the resulting violence.Khan supporters, led by Bushra Bibi, marched in various locations, including D-Chowk in Islamabad. A planned rally on November 24 was prevented by an Islamabad High Court order citing the visit of Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko and a new public order law. Protests also occurred globally.Speaking to PTI workers, Bibi said, ""This is not just about my husband; it is about this country and its leader."" Addressing a rally, she added, ""Until Imran Khan is with us, we will not end this protest. I will remain here until my last breath, and I ask all of you to stand by us. This isn’t just about my husband. It’s about the future of our country and the leadership we deserve.""Khan was ousted in a no-trust motion in 2022 and has been imprisoned since.

She alleged attempts to poison her food while incarcerated. She and Khan were jailed and fined $2 million each in a corruption case related to state gifts.

Prior to marrying Khan, Bibi was married to Maneka and was known as Bushra Maneka. She is a follower of Sufism and a devotee of the Sufi mystic poet Baba Farid.Khan stated in 2018 that he did not see Bibi’s face until after their marriage. “In a rare, and till then the only TV interview in October 2018, she dismissed this as bunkum,” regarrumors that she had foreseen Khan’s prime ministership in a dream.","Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, is leading protests demanding his release from jail.

He also said that law enforcement agencies were reaching their ""limits of restraint"" in handling the violence.Earlier, Khan, 72, in a post on X from jail, urged his supporters to continue their struggle, saying, ""My message for my team is to fight until the last ball is bowled. We will not back down until our demands are met.""The violence escalated after a march led by Khan’s wife and key aide Ali Amin Gandapur reached Islamabad on Tuesday. Khan’s wife fled as police pushed back against demonstrators.The protest, described by Khan as the ""final call,"" follows a series of demonstrations held by PTI since his imprisonment. Pakistan authorities noted that this protest was larger and more violent than previous ones, with participants reportedly armed with tear gas launchers, steel rods, and other objects.PTI has also called for the reversal of constitutional amendments that it claims undermine the judiciary, which has questioned some of the cases against Khan.Imran Khan, who was removed from power by parliament in 2022 after losing the support of the military, faces multiple charges, including corruption and incitement to violence, which he denies. Khan’s party had performed well in February elections but claimed the polls were rigged by a military-backed crackdown. The military has denied these allegations.","Security forces conducted a midnight raid on supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan after they stormed Islamabad. The protests turned violent, resulting in the deaths of six people, including four paramilitary soldiers. Security forces used tear gas to disperse protesters, and local media reported that lights in the area had been turned off during the operation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115714376,imgsize-1103538,width-400,resizemode-4/115714376.jpg"

'Protesters pushed back'

Input from Omer Farooq Khan

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan deployed its army within the nation's capital on Tuesday with orders to shoot protesters if necessary, as deadly clashes escalated between the police and supporters of former PM Imran Khan.The govt said four paramilitary rangers and two policemen were killed late Monday and over 100 security personnel injured in the violence, as thousands of protesters marched to Islamabad to demand Khan's release from prison. PM Shehbaz Sharif blamed the protesters for the soldiers' deaths, accusing them of ramming the paramilitary troops with a convoy of vehicles. ""It is not a peaceful protest. It is extremism,"" he said in a statement, aimed at achieving ""evil political designs"".Zulfikar Bukhari, spokesman for Khan's party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), denied Sharif's accusation and claimed that two protesters had been killed and 30 more injured in the clashes, the worst political violence seen in months in the nation of 241 million people. One of the protesters was shot dead and the other was run over by a vehicle, Bukhari said. Authorities did not reply to a query seeking to confirm the deaths.Meanwhile, Amnesty International said the govt must fully protect the rights of protesters and rescind ""shoot-on-sight"" orders that it said gave undue and excessive powers to military.Khan's supporters dismantled roadblocks that had been put in place to stop them while patriotic songs blared from vehicles. Some danced in front of the slow-moving convoy, some chanting, ""Revolution! Revolution!"" When they reached the square late afternoon, some chanted ""Prisoner Number 804"" - a reference to Khan - while others climbed atop shipping containers that had been set up to block their advance.PTI workers, many of them brandishing slingshots and sticks, engaged security personnel in combat as they attempted to make way to D-Chowk, a central square in front of parliament located close to key govt buildings such as the presidency, the PM office, and the supreme court. The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.Khan called for the demonstration over the weekend. Pakistan's military-backed civilian govt put the capital on lockdown, blocking major highways and suspending cellular and internet services in several areas. But protesters managed to enter the city Monday night.Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, was leading the protest with Ali Amin Gandapur, CM of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where PTI is in govt, accompanying her. Upon reaching Islamabad, Bibi vowed from atop a container truck: ""I promise that I will be the last woman here, I will not leave D-Chowk without him (Imran). You also promise me that you will not leave until Khan comes out. If anyone tells you otherwise, it is a lie.""In a post on X from jail, Khan, 72, said. ""To my team, my message is clear: Fight till the last ball... This is the struggle for Pakistan's survival and true freedom"". Khan also issued a call for more supporters to join protests in the capital. Khan accuses the govt and the military of conspiring to crush his party and undermine democracy. He has also criticised recent legal changes that limit the power of judiciary, arguing that they are meant to keep him out of power.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi, speaking to journalists, ruled out any negotiations with the protesters. He also claimed that the protesters, who had gathered at D-Chowk, had been pushed back and the area was cleared. The turmoil, meanwhile, has rattled investors. Pakistan's Stock Exchange lost more than $1.7 billion Tuesday. NYT & Agencies","Four paramilitary rangers and two policemen killed late Monday and over 100 security personnel injured.

ISLAMABAD: Thousands of protesters demanding the release of former prime minister Imran Khan arrived at the heart of Pakistan’s heavily fortified capital, Islamabad, on Tuesday amid intense teargas shelling and use of rubber bullets by security forces, even as the govt invoked Article 245 of the constitution, which allows a civilian govt to call in the army to help it implement law and order.At least four security personnel and two civilians were killed in overnight clashes between security forces and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters. Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said three Rangers (paramilitary force) personnel and one police constable were killed by miscreants. The Imran-Khan-led PTI denied the allegations, saying security officials were crushed by police and Rangers’ vehicles speeding away from protesters.“Under Article 245, the Pakistan army has been called in, and orders have been issued to deal with the miscreants with an iron hand,” the state-run Radio Pakistan reported. “Clear orders have also been issued to shoot miscreants and troublemakers on sight,” it added.On Tuesday, PTI workers, many of them brandishing slingshots and sticks, engaged security personnel in combat as they attempted to make their way to D-Chowk (Democracy Chowk), a central square in front of parliament.Imran’s wife, Bushra Bibi, was leading the protest with Ali Amin Gandapur, CM of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where PTI is in govt, accompanying her. Upon reaching Islamabad, Bibi vowed from atop a container truck: “I promise that I will be the last woman here, I will not leave D-Chowk without him (Imran). You also promise me that you will not leave until Khan comes out. If anyone tells you otherwise, it is a lie.”Gandapur urged protesters to camp at D-Chowk and not advance further into the Red Zone, housing important places, including the diplomatic enclave.Convoys of protesters had started making their way to Islamabad on Sunday from different parts of the country. Khan’s wife was leading the main convoy from the party’s stronghold of Peshawar. Islamabad has been in security lockdown since Sunday, with authorities closing all schools in the capital and the adjacent garrison city of Rawalpindi. Mobile and internet services have also been partially suspended in the twin cities.All roads and highways from nearby cities to the federal capital, as well as all routes that connect Islamabad and Rawalpindi, have been shut since last weekend.The PTI has been protesting for the release of political prisoners, including Khan. Its second demand is the reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment passed by parliament in Oct. The legislation has radically altered the judiciary by setting a fixed term of three years for the Supreme Court’s chief justice, who will now be selected by a parliamentary committee. It has also weakened the powers of the apex court, with constitutional cases and those involving fundamental rights to be heard by constitutional benches that will be constituted by panels dominated by govt representatives. The PTI’s last demand is for the return of its allegedly stolen Feb 8 general election mandate.","At least four security personnel and two civilians were killed in overnight clashes between security forces and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters.
