NEW DELHI: The medical examination of the 24-year-old law student, who was gang-raped inside South Calcutta Law College allegedly by an alumnus and two senior students, has confirmed signs of brutal sexual assault including “forceful penetration, bite marks and nail scratches on her body,” a Kolkata Police officer told PTI.The incident took place on the evening of June 25 inside a guard’s room adjacent to the student union office, police said, after the woman was reportedly assaulted for rejecting a marriage proposal from the main accused.The three men, including a practising criminal lawyer and two senior students have been arrested and remanded to police custody for four days. Forensic experts have sealed the crime scene and seized mobile phones of the accused for further investigation.According to the complaint filed at Kasba police station, the student had visited the college to fill out exam forms when she was asked to stay back. She alleged that after refusing a marriage proposal from the prime accused, she was physically assaulted, dragged into a room, and raped while the other two accused stood guard. The ordeal allegedly lasted over three hours, from around 7.30 pm to 10.30 pm.The survivor further told police that she was filmed during the assault and threatened with the release of the footage.She was also warned against informing anyone, with threats made against her boyfriend and family, police sources told PTI.“We are trying to find out whether the footage was forwarded to other numbers,” the officer added.Chief Public Prosecutor Sourin Ghosal told PTI that, “According to a Supreme Court judgement, all persons in a group involved in cases of gang rape must be held liable, even if all of them did not commit the act of rape. In this case, two other persons helped in the rape. So this is a case of gang rape, and they are also accused in the case.”The prime accused, a former student of the law college, had been hired as temporary non-teaching staff for 45 days. His social media profiles claimed he was a former president of the college's Trinamool Congress Chhatra Parishad (TMCP) unit and a current office-bearer of the south Kolkata wing of the TMC’s student body. Photos circulating online also show him alongside senior leaders of the ruling party.The Trinamool Congress has denied any current link with the accused and demanded ""severe punishment"" if he is found guilty.The case has triggered political uproar and street protests. Supporters of the SFI-DYFI clashed with police outside Kasba police station on Friday. Protesters from the BJP, Congress and AIDSO were also detained following separate demonstrations.Leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari has warned of escalating protests, while both the BJP and Congress have announced agitation programmes for Saturday.TMCP president Trinankur Bhattacharya distanced the organisation from the accused, saying the student union at the college has been defunct for years.State Minister Shashi Panja, addressing a press conference, said, “The state government stands firmly with the victim and her family. Instead of making the victim a battleground for politics, her pain must be understood, she must be respected, and justice must be ensured – swiftly and unconditionally.”The National Commission for Women has taken suo motu cognisance of the case and directed Kolkata Police to submit a detailed report within three days.The case has drawn comparisons with the August 2023 rape and murder of a medical intern at RG Kar Medical College, which also sparked widespread outrage and calls for better campus safety measures across West Bengal.(With inputs fro agencies)","The 24-year-old law student was allegedly gang-raped inside South Calcutta Law College.

Poll Should the international community take a stronger stance against TTP activities? Yes, to curb terrorism effectively No, current measures are sufficient

NEW DELHI: In a big setback for the ISI and Pakistan army, a Major rank officer and over a dozen other security personnel were killed in separate ambush attacks by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters in Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Tuesday. The slain Major, Moiz Abbas, from the 6 CDO battalion (SSG), had claimed he had captured IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthaman in 2019.Abbas was honorarily promoted to the rank of Major for his act. While Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir attended his funeral prayers on Wednesday, President Asif Zardari and PM Shehbaz Sharif offered condolences and praised him for fighting against the operatives of ‘Fitna-Al-Khwarij’, a term used by Pakistan for referring to TTP fighters.On Feb 27, 2019, Varthaman, then a Wing Commander, had downed an enemy jet (F-16) during an aerial combat with Pakistan in the aftermath of the Balakot airstrikes a day before. His own jet was subsequently hit, prompting an ejection and landing on enemy soil. He was held captive for three days and released by Pakistan on March 1. He was later conferred with the Vir Chakra, India's thirdhighest war-time gallantry medal, and promoted to the rank of Group Captain.Abbas (37) was an SSG commando from Chakwal. He was seen in an interview to the Pakistani media describing Varthaman’s capture and rescue from angry civilians.Confirming Abbas’s death, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that Abbas led his troops from the front. “He fought gallantly and paid the ultimate sacrifice along with another brave son of the soil, Lance Naik Jibran Ullah, during the intense fire exchange,” it said. The ISPR also claimed that 11 TTP fighters were killed and called them “India-sponsored terrorists”, their usual ploy to avoid naming Afghanistan or Taliban.Sources said the TTP fighters targeted Pakistan army personnel in two separate ambushes in Kurram and Sararogha in south Waziristan. While eight Pakistani soldiers were killed and 10 injured in Kurram, at least six soldiers were killed in South Waziristan. TTP operatives also destroyed army vehicles and seized weapons before leaving.In a statement issued on its Telegram account, TTP said videos of both attacks would be released soon. ISPR, however, said, “During the operation, our troops effectively engaged the Khwarij location and 11 Indian-sponsored Khwarij were killed and seven got injured by the security forces.”","A Major rank officer and over a dozen other security personnel were killed in separate ambush attacks by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters in Waziristan.

With this, the former J&K chief minister’s ambitious plan to provide an alternative political force in the UT now seems like a closed chapter.In the past few months, Azad himself has not shown any interest in reviving his party as he has not held any meeting.Former ministers Taj Mohiuddin and Ghulam Nabi Saroori, who were among the first to leave Congress and join DPAP in Aug 2022, rejoined Congress at the party headquarters in Srinagar. Regretting his earlier decision to leave the party, Mohiuddin said: “Congress has always been my home. Leaving it was a painful and unfortunate decision.” Saroori described his return as a “ghar wapsi” (homecoming).Both Saroori and Mohideen, who had been with Congress for decades before they parted ways, had been planning their return for the past few months. “Congress is like an ocean,” Mohiuddin said.J&K Congress president Tariq Hameed Karra said the return of the two ex-ministers would strengthen the party.“There are others also who want to rejoin, and we are considering each case one by one,” Karra said. Last month, DPAP Kashmir president, Mohammad Amin Bhat, had rejoined Congress.On April 14, Azad had announced the dissolution of his party organisation as part of a restructuring exercise, but there was no development thereafter. The move came nearly six months after DPAP’s rout in the Oct 2024 Assembly polls despite Azad’s intensive campaigning across J&K. The party contested 23 out of 90 seats, but could not secure a single victory.After Azad founded DPAP, nearly 90 per cent of Congress representatives in J&K joined him, leaving the grand old party virtually defunct in the UT.

A day after gunning down a Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist in Basantgarh in J&K’s Udhampur district, a joint team of security forces continued combing the rain-soaked forests of Bihali in the upper reaches Friday to track the slain ultra’s three trapped associates.“After a night’s pause, the search operation resumed on Friday morning, with the cordon further strengthened by additional reinforcements to cut off escape routes. Aerial surveillance using drones is underway. Sniffer dogs have also been roped in to assist the search,” an official said.Monsoon rain, while slowing troop movement, is helping forces restrict the terrorists’ range and pin them within the forest. “The weather is bad in Basantgarh. Once it clears, the situation will become more evident,” Jammu range IG Bhim Sen Tuti had said on Thursday, adding that the four terrorists were likely part of a group that police had been tracking in the Jammu region for nearly a year.Basantgarh falls on the traditional infiltration route for Pakistani terrorists, who cross over the international border in Kathua, and travel to Udhampur via higher reaches to proceed towards Doda and Kishtwar districts in Jammu region, to further move into Kashmir Valley. With help from overground workers affiliated with numerous proscribed outfits, these infiltrators move from one place to another, taking cover in forests and natural caves. The belt has witnessed several encounters and terror attacks in the past, and security forces have arrested many overground workers for providing logistic support to ultras.","A day after gunning down a Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist in Basantgarh in J&K’s Udhampur district, a joint team of security forces continued combing the rain-soaked forests of Bihali in the upper reaches.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122118692,imgsize-2524795,width-400,resizemode-4/122118692.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Finding Pakistan teaming up with China to push its line on terrorism at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation defence ministers' meet at Qingdao, India Thursday refused to sign the proposed joint statement as it would've diluted its consistent stand on the scourge endangering regional peace and stability.Given the SCO norm stipulating consensus, the statement couldn't be adopted despite overnight talks, as defence minister Rajnath Singh made it clear that perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of terror acts, including cross-border terrorism, must be held accountable.Also read: ‘Proposal objected by one particular country,’ MEA on why Rajnath Singh refused to sign SCO statement There can be no double standards on this, Singh said, speaking at the 10-nation SCO meet with his Pakistani and Chinese counterparts Khawaja Asif and Admiral Dong Jun, among others, in attendance.Singh rejected the statement after finding that Pakistan, with help of current SCO chair China, opposed mention of the Pahalgam massacre and instead wanted ""terrorist activities"" in Balochistan and the situation in J&K to figure in it, sources told TOI.Pakistan was especially keen to include Jaffar Express hijacking in its restive Balochistan province in March in the joint document. Pakistan frequently accuses India of fomenting the ongoing insurgency for greater autonomy and independence in Balochistan.India, on its part, has consistently rejected all such ""baseless"" allegations.""The Indian delegation led by Rajnath Singh had serious objections to the draft joint statement and its language, which reeked of double standards in dealing with a serious issue like terrorism,"" a source said. External affairs ministry spokesperson said, ""India wanted its concerns on terrorism reflected in the document, which was not acceptable to one particular country (Pakistan) and, thus, the statement was not adopted. ""Both India and Pakistan in 2017 became full members of SCO, which also includes Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iran and Belarus.Speaking at the meet, Singh said peace and prosperity cannot co-exist with terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in the hands of non-state actors and terror groups. ""Dealing with these challenges requires decisive action and we must unite in our fight against these evils for our collective safety and security,"" Singh said.In a clear reference to Pakistan, he said, ""Some countries use crossborder terrorism as an instrument of policy and provide shelter to terrorists. There should be no place for such double standards. SCO should not hesitate to criticise such nations.""The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy of UN designated terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) based in Pakistan, carried out the heinous attack in Pahalgam on April 22, in which 26 civilians were shot dead after being profiled on the basis of religious identity. ""The pattern of Pahalgam terror attack matches with LeT's previous terror attacks in India. In exercising its right to defend against terrorism and pre-empt as well as deter further crossborder terrorist attacks, India on May 7 successfully launched Operation Sindoor to dismantle cross-border terrorist infrastructure,"" Singh said.India's zero tolerance for terrorism was manifested through its actions, he said. ""This includes our right to defend ourselves against terrorism. We have shown that epicentres of terrorism are no longer safe... India reaffirms its resolve to fight terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,"" he added.","Rajnath Singh made it clear that perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of terror acts, including cross-border terrorism, must be held accountable.

Driving the news

Trump Gives Troops Free Hand At Border? More Trouble For Immigrants As U.S. Expands Military Zones

Why it matters

These twin operations signal a tectonic shift in the Middle East power balance. With its military elite decapitated, Iran faces an uncertain future.

Israel, meanwhile, has solidified its regional military dominance and is now eyeing a historic realignment of alliances.

US support - delivered through precision bunker-buster strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites - amplified the effect. President Donald Trump declared Iran’s nuclear program “obliterated.” But analysts question whether Iran's capacity has truly been neutralized or merely delayed.

The attacks also exposed how deeply Israeli intelligence has penetrated Iran, including the ability to stage drone strikes from within the country - a psychological as well as tactical coup.

The big picture

The Wall Street Journal’s report, based on interviews with 18 Israeli and US officials, reads like a thriller - but the consequences are deadly real:

'Red Wedding' was designed to wipe out Iran’s senior military planners in a single strike. Israeli intelligence tracked their movements and struck when they unknowingly clustered together. “Rather than scattering, they gathered - sealing their fate,” WSJ wrote.

'Operation Narnia', dubbed so for its implausibility, eliminated key scientific minds behind Iran’s nuclear program. The assassinations were nearly simultaneous, designed to prevent escape or dispersion.

The plan had its roots in a two-decade-long intelligence and training effort. Starting in the 1990s, Israel identified the need not only to destroy Iranian nuclear infrastructure but also the human capital behind it.

Israeli F-15s and F-16s trained for long-range missions in Greek airspace and later honed those capabilities during strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen - a proving ground for the logistics now deployed against Iran.

Netanyahu’s final go-ahead came on June 9. To preserve surprise, Israel deployed strategic deception - including faking a wedding for Netanyahu’s son and leaking false tensions with Trump to lull Tehran into complacency.

Zoom in: How they did it

Spycraft and drones: Mossad smuggled in parts for explosive quadcopter drones hidden in shipping containers and trucks. Teams set them up near air-defense systems and missile sites, ready to strike at launch time.

Airspace advantage: The fall of Syria’s Iranian-aligned government in early 2025 cleared the path for Israeli jets to fly through without resistance - a key enabler of the operation’s success.

Information dominance: Israeli intelligence mapped Iran’s air defense grid using thousands of data points. At the critical moment, Iranian defenses were neutralized - by both remote attacks and internal sabotage.

US partnership: Trump’s support came later - but crucially. US forces struck deep underground nuclear facilities, including Fordo, with B-2 bombers and Tomahawk missiles.

Trump claimed, “Nothing was taken out... too dangerous, and very heavy and hard to move!” in response to reports Iran may have evacuated uranium ahead of the strike.

Between the lines

A ceasefire, but not peace

Twelve days of war between Iran and Israel have ended in uneasy silence. The bombs have stopped falling, but Iran’s theocratic regime is in chaos.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86 and visibly weakened, finally emerged on state TV to insist that the US and Israeli strikes had “achieved nothing significant.” Most observers - and satellite imagery - disagreed.

Iran’s nuclear infrastructure is badly damaged. Its Revolutionary Guard’s leadership has been decimated. Its elite scientists are dead. And perhaps most damning: Israel operated with almost complete impunity, exposing Iran’s hollow air defenses and compromised intelligence apparatus.

The ceasefire, brokered with US pressure, gave Tehran a break - but not a win. “There must be some sort of purge,” said Hamidreza Azizi of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. “But who will implement it? That is the question.”

What’s next





Operation Narnia. Red Wedding. A vanished Supreme Leader. Nine scientists dead before sunrise. What unfolded over Tehran this month wasn’t just a military campaign. It was a high-wire act of deception, logistics, and old-fashioned assassination - carried out with such precision it felt pulled from fantasy. But according to the Wall Street Journal, every bit of it was real. And if the consequences weren’t already grave, they are only just beginning to unfold.Israel’s June 13 airstrike - 'Red Wedding' - marked the deadliest and most consequential single night in its long-simmering shadow war with Iran. The Wall Street Journal reveals how Israeli jets eliminated Iran’s top air force leadership in one fell swoop, comparing the stunning outcome to the infamous massacre from Game of Thrones.This was no isolated blow. That night also marked the success of 'Operation Narnia', a parallel mission that simultaneously killed nine of Iran’s leading nuclear scientists. Within hours, Iran’s military and nuclear elite were shattered.Deception was critical. Netanyahu’s team played a long game, misleading both Iran and global observers. Media leaks falsely implied Trump was holding Israel back from attacking.Netanyahu publicly planned a family wedding. Israeli military movements were framed as drills.The real victory? Intelligence. Israeli infiltration of Iran was so complete that it not only enabled high-precision targeting but allowed drone teams to operate inside Iran - and coordinate with airstrikes.Strategic misdirection worked. Iranian commanders, misreading Israeli and American intentions, assembled in a single location. Israel’s elite strike forces were waiting.The risk was massive. Had even one part failed - if scientists escaped or defenses held - retaliation could’ve been catastrophic. Israel bet big. It won. For now.Iran may accelerate its nuclear weaponization - the very thing Israel sought to stop. US intelligence is divided over whether the program was set back by years or just months.Meanwhile, President Trump says backchannel talks with Iran are “already happening.” His envoy Steve Witkoff hinted at a “long-term peace agreement.”Meanwhile, Tehran is denying plans to resume nuclear talks.For now, Iran's regime seems far away from collapse - it's just wounded. And wounded regimes don’t always back down. They often lash out.In 'Game of Thrones', the 'Red Wedding' wasn’t just a massacre. It shattered the rules. It ended one war and started another. Israel’s own 'Red Wedding' may have done the same.(With inputs from agencies)",'Red Wedding' was designed to wipe out Iran’s senior military planners in a single strike.

Who is Manojit Mishra?

Ongoing investigation

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)





KOLKATA: Police in Kolkata have arrested three men after a 24-year-old female law student alleged she was gang-raped inside her college campus on Wednesday evening.The woman, who studies at a law college in south Kolkata, said she was called to the campus on the pretext of being offered a key position in the student union. According to her complaint, between 7.30pm and 10.50pm, she was taken to the campus security guards’ room, where she was sexually assaulted and threatened. Her father later took her home.On Thursday at 4.45pm, an FIR was lodged at the local police station, naming three accused: Manojit Mishra, a former student currently employed at the college, and current students Pramit Mukherjee (20) and Zaib Ahmed (19).Mishra and Ahmed were arrested from the Talbagan crossing around 7.20pm the same day, while Mukherjee was picked up from his residence at 12.30am on Friday. All three were produced before the Alipore Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate on Thursday morning and remanded to police custody until 1 July.Mishra has had a long association with the college. He initially enrolled in 2007 but dropped out, rejoining in 2017 for a BA LLB course and graduating in 2022. He was active in the student wing of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and rose to a leadership role.However, in 2021, he was removed from his post following reports of unruly behaviour, including a 2017 incident of vandalism in the principal’s office.Despite multiple allegations of harassment and molestation during his student years, no police case was filed at the time.In 2023, he returned to the college as a contractual non-teaching staffer. Police are investigating whether his continued influence on campus and previous political links may have shielded him from disciplinary or legal consequences earlier.Mishra lived alone in Kalighat, estranged from his family. His father, Robin Mishra, a local priest, publicly stated that his son should be held accountable if found guilty. Mishra’s mother and sister moved out some years ago, and his grandmother died in 2023. Neighbours described him as aggressive and often involved in drunken altercations at home.Police have taken the survivor’s statement and seized CCTV footage from the college campus. They are examining whether any other staff or students were involved or had knowledge of the incident.Investigators are also reviewing past complaints against Mishra to determine whether any action was suppressed due to political connections.The college administration has not issued a formal statement yet.","Police in Kolkata have arrested three men after a 24-year-old female law student alleged she was gang-raped inside her college campus.

US President Donald Trump on Friday reflected on threats to his life while addressing a key court decision that expands his administration’s policy-making powers.During a White House media briefing, Trump recalled an incident from July 13, 2024, when a bullet grazed his ear during a campaign event in Pennsylvania. ""I get that throbbing feeling every once in a while,"" he said. ""But you know what? That's okay. This is a dangerous business.""The remarks came as the Republican president acknowledged a Supreme Court ruling that curtails federal judges’ ability to issue nationwide injunctions against executive policies, a decision seen as a major victory for his administration.Drawing comparisons to other high-risk professions, Trump added, ""You have race car drivers as an example, 1/10 of 1% die. Bull riders, 1/10 of 1%. That's not a lot, but it's — people die. When you're president, it's about 5%. If somebody would have told me that, maybe I wouldn't have run. Okay? This is, this is a very dangerous profession.""Historically, four US presidents have been assassinated while in office, and several others- including candidates- have survived gunshot wounds.Trump himself has faced multiple threats. Law enforcement agencies say he survived an assassination attempt on September 15, 2024, while golfing in West Palm Beach, Florida.The suspect, who faces five federal charges, has pleaded not guilty.In the July shooting incident, Secret Service agents killed the assailant. One person attending the rally was killed, and two others were injured.The US government has also accused Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of plotting to assassinate Trump. Iran, whose nuclear sites were targeted by US military strikes last weekend, has denied the allegation.Now in his second term, Trump has pushed for greater executive authority, targeted political rivals, and pledged to take action against opponents.Meanwhile, on the international front, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo on Friday agreed to a US-brokered peace accord aimed at ending a violent conflict that has claimed thousands of lives and displaced hundreds of thousands in 2025.The US is currently experiencing its most prolonged period of political violence since the 1970s. According to Reuters, more than 300 politically motivated violent incidents have occurred since Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021.","US President Donald Trump reflected on threats to his life while addressing a key court decision that expands his administration’s policy-making powers.

A senior United States justice department (DOJ) official said ""it's time for a new leadership"" at the University of Virginia (UVA), after the Ivy League school's chairman James Ryan resigned amid pressure from the Trump administration to dismantle the university's diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies.""Jim Ryan has built his entire career on what was the academic vogue which is DEI.

He called it an ""excruciatingly difficult decision"" made with a ""very heavy heart.""""To make a long story short, I am inclined to fight for what I believe in, and I believe deeply in this university.

US President Donald Trump has once again claimed credit for averting a full-scale war between India and Pakistan, saying he warned both countries of halting all trade ties, which led to the cessation of hostilities.Speaking to reporters at the White House on Friday, Trump asserted, “We did some great work. India and Pakistan. That was going to be maybe nuclear. We did that.”He said he ordered his top officials to cancel all trade deals with both Delhi and Islamabad when the two nuclear-armed neighbours were “amidst a big fight”.“Serbia, Kosovo is going to go at it, going to be a big war. I said, ‘you go at it, there's no trade with the United States.… That's what happened with India and Pakistan. I was negotiating with both of them and I said to (treasury secretary) Scott (Bessent), I said to (commerce secretary) Howard (Lutnick), cancel all deals with India and Pakistan. They're not trading with us because they're in a war,” Trump said.Trump said the two countries “called back. ‘What do we do?’ I said, ‘Look, you want to have trade with the United States. It's great, but you want to go and start using nuclear weapons on each other.We're not going to allow that.’ And they both agreed, both have great leaders. They both agreed not to do it. So so we did a lot,” Trump said.Later, Trump also repeated this narrative during the signing of a peace deal between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, claiming credit for “peace between India and Pakistan, Israel and Iran, and DRC and Rwanda.”He told the press, “We have two great leaders… they were able to stop. I guess everybody saw that it was going to get very bad.”However, India has consistently maintained that the de-escalation with Pakistan was the result of direct talks between the Directors General of Military Operations (DGMOs).Prime Minister Narendra Modi had firmly conveyed during a phone call with Trump last week that India does not accept mediation and that the initiative came from Pakistan.The India-Pakistan ceasefire was reached on May 10, following four days of intense cross-border missile and drone attacks. While Trump has repeatedly asserted his diplomatic role, India’s official stance has been that the ceasefire involved a bilateral military understanding without any third-party involvement.Meanwhile, Trump had also hinted at the possibility of a major trade breakthrough with India. “I think we're going to reach a deal where we have the right to go in and trade,” he said. The US has been pushing for market access in areas like electric vehicles, wine, and dairy, while India seeks tariff concessions on garments, seafood, and gems.As negotiations continue, a top Indian trade delegation led by special secretary Rajesh Agrawal is currently in Washington to try and conclude an interim pact before the July 9 deadline.The US had earlier suspended high tariffs on Indian goods until that date, and both sides are reportedly working on a first tranche of the broader trade pact that could be finalised later this year.","US President Donald Trump has claimed credit for averting a full-scale war between India and Pakistan.

KOLKATA: The rape of a student of a college in the heart of south Kolkata near a main thoroughfare is the culmination of violence, political interference and illegal activities at the institute in the past few years.The 50-year-old college on Swinhoe Street, off Gariahat, relocated to a new G+6 storey building in 2019. Sources said there were multiple incidents on both campuses. In 2017, the principal's room was vandalised in a fracas between two TMCP groups over funds for the freshers' welcome programme. This prompted the then education minister Partha Chatterjee to scrap the TMCP unit at the college. A cop complaint was registered at Gariahat PS.Manojit Mishra, the prime accused in the rape case, was then the TMCP unit president and was arrested along with two other students. They were later released.Within months of the college shifting to the new building at Kasba in 2019, there was a scuffle between students that spilled onto the main road. Again in 2022, a scuffle between two groups led to rampant vandalism in which an elderly person from the area was severely thrashed.In 2024, a fourth-year student was badly beaten up by Mishra and his aides, and a plaint was registered against them. During that time, another fourth-year female student registered a harassment and ragging plaint against Mishra and indicated that he was so influential that no one dared to take action against him.Current students said though the union was officially dissolved in 2017, some students continued to wield influence and claimed to be TMCP members.Teacher-in-charge Nayna Chatterjee said ex-students and outsiders had free access to the college. ""The official hours are from 9 am to 4 pm and we try to shut the gates thereafter. But some students refuse to leave the campus. I have reported this to higher officials several times,"" she said.Ex-students alleged large-scale political interference, with local netas often attending programmes on campus under the party banner. An ex-student said, ""We used to have regular classes till noon. Thereafter, most students would go for practice under seniors or attend internship programmes. The college authority has failed to stop these hooligans as these people have been active for many years.""","The 50-year-old college on Swinhoe Street, off Gariahat, relocated to a new G+6 storey building in 2019.

Billionaire Jeff Bezos and journalist Lauren Sanchez tied the knot at a sumptuous ceremony on an island in Italy's Venice on Friday, with several A-listers in attendance for the couple's wedding.Amazon founder Bezos exchanged vows with Sanchez on the iconic San Giorgio Maggiore island, news agency AFP reported citing Italian media.Later, the bride posted a photo on Instagram under a new name - laurensanchezbezos - showing her in a long flowing white dress and the groom in black tie.Bezos, 61, and Sanchez, 55, are staying at the Aman hotel, a luxury 16th-century palazzo on the Grand Canal with a view of the famous Rialto bridge.Their celebrity guests are staying at the Gritti Palace and the St. Regis.The celebrations are set to end on Saturday with a party likely at the Arsenale - a vast shipyard complex dating back to when the Italian city was a naval powerhouse.While Bezos was previously married to novelist MacKenzie Scott, Sanchez's ex-husband is businessman Patrick Whitesell.However, the wedding was not without its share of controversy.Protesters wondered how long Venice can ""endure"" - while the billionaires party, activists say the ""fragile"" city is ""sinking"", overrun by tourists, and is a victim of depopulation as locals unable to pay soaring rents are forced out.Environmental activists have also pointed to the carbon footprint of the mega yachts and dozens of private jets - at least 95 - bringing the rich and famous to Venice, which is known for its canals and waterways, and also hosted the 2014 wedding of Hollywood star George Clooney and human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin.On the other hand, Italy's tourism ministry said it expects the festivities to generate nearly one billion euros, of which about 895 million is estimated to come from the ""media visibility.""The newly-married couple are donating three million euros ($3.5 million) to the city, according to Luca Zaia, the regional president of the Veneto region of which Venice is the capital.","Billionaire Jeff Bezos and journalist Lauren Sanchez tied the knot at a sumptuous ceremony on an island in Italy's Venice on Friday.

Zohran Mamdani ‘UNDER ATTACK’: Trump, Republicans Unleash Barrage Of Threats On NYC Mayor Nominee

Poll Should a politician's immigration history influence public perception of their leadership? Yes No

What is the Communist Control Act? Could Mamdani be deported?







Republicans raised a call to revoke Zohran Mamdani's citizenship and deport him before he becomes New York mayor citing the fact that Mamdani became a US citizen only seven years ago. The 33-year-old Democrat Socialist is the Democratic nominee for New York's mayoral election in November -- after former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo conceded the primary election.The New York Young Republican Club called for deporting Mamdani as it said: “The radical Zohran Mamdani cannot be allowed to destroy our beloved city of New York.""The club called on White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, known for his hawkish stand on immigration, to invoke the Red Scare-era Communist Control Act to strip Mamdani's citizenship.Stephen Miller already expressed his disgust at Mamdani's win and said it was the ""clearest warning of what happens to a society when it fails to control migration"". “The entire Democrat party is lining up behind the diehard socialist who wants to end all immigration enforcement and abolish the prison system entirely,” he added.The Communist Control Act was signed into law by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1954 during the Cold War.The legislation outlawed, in theory, the Communist Party in the United States and prohibited communists from attaining certain positions. But it was rarely enforced.Zohran Mamdani was born in Uganda in 1991 and moved to New York along with his parents at the age of seven in 1988. His father Mahmood Mamdani is an Ugandan-American with his ancestry in India, his mother Mira Nair is an Indian-American. Zohran Mamdani became a naturalized US citizen in 2018.President Donald Trump called Mamdani 100 per cent communist lunatic. Trump also commented on his looks and voice and called everything terrible. “It’s finally happened, the Democrats have crossed the line. Zohran Mamdani, a 100% Communist Lunatic, has just won the Dem Primary, and is on his way to becoming Mayor. We’ve had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous. He looks TERRIBLE, his voice is grating, he’s not very smart, he’s got AOC+3, Dummies ALL, backing him, and even our Great Palestinian Senator, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer, is groveling over him.

Operation Midnight Hammer: Tehran confirms nuclear sites suffered 'serious' damage; mulls ending IAEA access,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/operation-midnight-hammer-tehran-confirms-nuclear-sites-suffered-serious-damage-mulls-ending-iaea-access/articleshow/122102655.cms,"File photo: Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi (Picture credit: AP)

Fico Blasts EU ‘For Liking War,’ Vetoes Russia Sanctions | ‘Truce For Iran, What About Ukraine?’





Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, on Thursday publicly admitted that the country’s nuclear sites sustained “significant and serious damages” in last weekend’s US airstrikes on three facilities, the first such official acknowledgement from Tehran.“The losses have not been small, and our facilities have been seriously damaged,” Araghchi said on Iran’s state television, confirming the full impact of Operation Midnight Hammer, reported the New York Times.The strikes, launched by US B-2 bombers using bunker-busting bombs, targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. Araghchi’s remarks contrasted sharply with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who earlier in the day had dismissed US President Donald Trump’s claims of “obliteration” as “exaggerated.”While Khamenei insisted in a prerecorded video that the attacks “were unable to do anything important,” Araghchi painted a far more serious picture and also warned that Iran may end its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). “Without a doubt, we are obliged to enforce this law,” he said, referring to a bill passed by hard-liners and approved by the Guardian Council that would suspend all collaboration with the UN nuclear watchdog.He added, “Our relationship with the agency will take a different shape,” and noted that a visit by IAEA chief Rafael Grossi “would not be welcomed” at this time. Iran has also hinted that it may no longer permit IAEA inspections and will stop filing monitoring reports, a move that has drawn global concern.Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei had earlier admitted the nuclear sites were “badly damaged.” Israeli military officials and American intelligence have similarly assessed that the strikes significantly degraded Iran’s nuclear program, with Brig Gen Effie Defrin stating it has been “set back by years.”US President Trump has defended the strikes, comparing them to the end-of-World War II atomic bombings in Japan. “I don’t want to use an example of Hiroshima or Nagasaki… but that was essentially the same thing. That ended that war. This ended the war,” he said.However, key questions remain unresolved. Iran has not revealed the fate of its 400 kilograms of enriched uranium, enough for nearly 10 nuclear bombs, nor has it confirmed the status of its advanced centrifuges. These details could be clarified by IAEA inspectors, should Tehran allow access.Analysts, including Sina Azodi of George Washington University, believe Tehran is using the confusion to its advantage. “Iran wants to keep everything in the dark… to play the diplomatic game of poker,” Azodi was quoted as saying by the New York Times.Despite Araghchi saying “no agreement has yet been reached” to resume talks, the White House has maintained a tone of cautious optimism. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated the administration’s commitment to diplomacy, saying, “The president wants peace. He always has… and we’re on a diplomatic path with Iran”.Talks are tentatively expected next week, with special envoy Steve Witkoff continuing behind-the-scenes negotiations, supported by regional partners like Qatar.However, Araghchi warned, saying, “Going through a war changes many realities… diplomacy must adjust itself to this new reality.”","Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, on Thursday publicly admitted that the country's nuclear sites sustained “significant and serious damages” in last weekend's US airstrikes on three facilities. “The losses have not been small, and our facilities have been seriously damaged,” he said.

A Quantus survey has revealed that 47 per cent of Americans approve of the US's Operation Midnight Hammer on Iran while 36 per cent disapprove, with approval strongest among Republicans and disapproval among Democrats. But the strike has impacted Donald Trump's approval rating only marginally, giving a short-term boost on key aspects of foreign policy.The Quantus poll, conducted between June 23 and 25 among 1000 registered voters, showed that Trump's approval slipped slightly to 47 per cent, down from 48 per cent. His disapproval rating rose 1 point to 50 per cent, giving him a net approval of -3 points, down from -2 points earlier this month, but still within the poll's ±3 per cent margin of error.Another poll, the latest poll by Quinnipiac conducted between June 22 and 24 among 979 self-identified registered voters, showed a more positive result for Trump, with his approval rating at 41 per cent, a 3-point increase from the previous survey earlier this month. His disapproval rating remains unchanged at 54 per cent, which falls within the poll's margin of error of ±3.1 percentage points.American Pulse Research and Polling conducted a poll among 633 registered voters from June 23 to June 25, showing Trump with a net approval of +1, with 50 per cent approving and 49 per cent disapproving, a lead within the poll's margin of error of ±3.9 per cent.On the specific question of Trump's handling of the Israel-Iran conflict, Trump received his strongest numbers yet: 60 per cent of voters approve, with just 25 per cent disapproving, according to Quantus. That includes 59 per cent of independents, and a majority support across suburban (59 per cent) and rural voters (72 per cent).The Emerson College Polling survey released Friday found 45 per cent of respondents approved of the job Trump was doing as president, while 46 per cent disapproved.

The president of the University of Virginia, James Ryan, is stepping down following pressure from the justice department, which had urged his resignation during an investigation into the university’s diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices, according to a source familiar with the matter, reported news agency AP.Ryan’s exit marks a major shift in the Trump administration’s campaign to reshape higher education, extending federal scrutiny beyond Ivy League schools to include public universities. It also signals a pivot in focus, from antisemitism to DEI policies, which the administration argues discriminate against white and asian american students.Trump has pushed a hardline stance against what he calls “woke indoctrination,” signing a January executive order to dismantle DEI initiatives nationwide. The education department has since launched investigations into numerous colleges.At UVA, conservative critics, including Trump-aligned group America First Legal, accused the university of renaming and repackaging DEI under new labels instead of eliminating it. In response, the university’s board voted in March to shut down its DEI office and end diversity policies in admissions, hiring, and financial aid, an action praised by Republican Gov.Glenn Youngkin, who declared “DEI is done at the University of Virginia. ”Ryan, who had previously signed a letter opposing what he called “political interference” in higher education, became a target for critics. America First Legal directly called for his removal, saying UVA’s response defied federal directives.Ted Mitchell, head of the American council on education, condemned the move as federal overreach. “This is a dark day for the University of Virginia, a dark day for higher education,” he said.Virginia’s Democratic senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine also denounced the administration’s pressure, calling it politically motivated and harmful to the state’s future.Ryan, who led UVA since 2018 and previously served as a dean at Harvard, had been known for promoting faculty diversity. His resignation highlights growing tensions between universities and the federal government over the limits of political influence in public education.","James Ryan, president of the University of Virginia, is stepping down following pressure from the justice department.

‘New chapter of hope’: Marco Rubio hails Rwanda-DRC peace deal; credits Trump for claimed truce of India-Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-chapter-of-hope-marco-rubio-hails-rwanda-drc-peace-deal-credits-trump-for-claimed-truce-of-india-pakistan/articleshow/122120129.cms,"US secretary of state Marco Rubio (AP)

US secretary of state Marco Rubio on Friday hailed President Donald Trump ’s diplomatic approach to global conflicts, crediting his leadership for breakthroughs in some of the world’s most complex conflicts.“Whether it's been in Ukraine and Russia, whether it's been Pakistan-India, whether it's been Iran and Israel, and in the continent of Africa, President Trump's priority has been on peace and today we see this come to fruition,” Rubio said at the White House.Rubio’s praise is part of a larger pattern of the current administration’s efforts to end global conflicts, including a claimed truce between India and Pakistan and reduced tensions in the Middle East, all under what Rubio describes as Trump’s “peace-first” approach.His remarks came during a media briefing with Trump and Vice President JD Vance following the signing of a landmark peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), one of Africa’s deadliest and most complex conflicts in recent decades.The deal, signed in Washington on Friday, commits both nations to end support for armed rebel groups, notably the M23 and FDLR militias, and sets a timeline for the withdrawal of Rwandan troops from eastern Congo.It also establishes a joint security coordination body and lays the groundwork for regional economic cooperation.Trump, who welcomed the foreign ministers of Rwanda and DRC to the White House, called it “a wonderful day,” adding, “Today, the violence and destruction comes to an end, and the entire region begins a new chapter of hope and opportunity.”The conflict had escalated earlier this year after M23 rebels, widely believed to be backed by Rwanda, captured swathes of territory in mineral-rich eastern Congo. While Rwanda has denied direct involvement, the deal now calls for the ""neutralization"" of the FDLR, a Hutu rebel group with links to the 1994 Rwandan genocide.Rwandan foreign minister Olivier Nduhungirehe said ending support for Hutu militants should be the “first order of business,” while his Congolese counterpart Therese Kayikwamba Wagner said the deal offers “a rare chance to turn the page.”Trump also emphasized the strategic benefits to the US, noting it would gain “a lot of mineral rights from the Congo,” a region rich in cobalt and lithium.The agreement drew wide but not universal praise.Bintu Keita, a senior UN official in the DRC, said it ""marks a decisive step toward peace and stability,"" while Germany hailed the ""excellent news"" and called for implementation.UN envoy Bintou Keita called the deal “a decisive step toward peace,” though Nobel laureate Denis Mukwege warned it risked rewarding “aggression” and legitimizing “plunder” of Congolese resources.","US secretary of state Marco Rubio hailed President Donald Trump’s diplomatic approach to global conflicts.

Ceasefire next week? Trump hopeful on Gaza deal; Israel-Hamas talks in motion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ceasefire-next-week-trump-hopeful-on-gaza-deal-israel-hamas-talks-in-motion/articleshow/122120110.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Friday expressed hope that a ceasefire in Gaza could be reached soon, saying a deal involving Israel and Hamas might come as early as next week.“We think within the next week, we're going to get a ceasefire,” Trump told reporters when asked about the possibility of ending the fighting in the war-ravaged Palestinian territory.The current round of violence in the region resumed in March, when Israel declared a previously brokered ceasefire to be over and launched new attacks on Hamas. That earlier truce had been negotiated in the final days of former US President Joe Biden’s term, with backing from Trump’s incoming administration.The conflict began when Hamas launched a deadly assault on Israel on October 7, 2023. Since then, Gaza has suffered widespread destruction and a severe humanitarian crisis.Following the breakdown of the ceasefire, Israel also blocked the entry of food and other essential supplies into Gaza for more than two months, raising concerns over a looming famine.In recent weeks, Israel resumed limited aid flow through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a system supported by the United States and involving American security contractors working with Israeli troops at the edges of Gaza.On Thursday, US announced $30 million in funding for the GHF programme. “We're supplying, as you know, a lot of money and a lot of food to that area,” Trump said. “We're involved because people are dying. And look at those crowds of people that have no food, no anything.”However, the aid distribution effort has been surrounded by controversy. Witnesses and Gaza officials have reported several instances of Palestinians being killed while waiting near distribution centres.Israeli newspaper Haaretz quoted unnamed soldiers who claimed their commanders had ordered them to fire on crowds near aid zones to disperse them, even when they posed no threat. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied the report.","US President Donald Trump says a ceasefire in Gaza could be reached as early as next week.

Hundreds of thousands of Haitians living legally in the United States could soon face deportation, after the Trump administration announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for the Caribbean nation.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced on Friday that conditions in Haiti had improved sufficiently to end the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program, which currently covers approximately 500,000 Haitians, including some who have resided in the US for over a decade.The TPS status for Haitians will officially expire on August 3, with deportations beginning on September 2, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed.“This decision restores integrity in our immigration system and ensures that Temporary Protective Status is actually temporary,” a DHS spokesperson said. “The environmental situation in Haiti has improved enough that it is safe for Haitian citizens to return home.”However, the US State Department still advises Americans not to travel to Haiti, citing widespread gang violence, crime, civil unrest, and poor access to healthcare.According to the International Organization for Migration, 1.3 million people have been displaced in Haiti due to gang violence, with nearly 11% of the country’s population forced from their homes.Despite these conditions, TPS holders are being asked to return to Haiti using a mobile application called CBP Home.The move is part of a broader campaign promise by President Donald Trump to carry out mass deportations and scale back the use of humanitarian immigration programmes. Earlier this year, the administration also revoked legal protections for thousands of Haitians who had entered under a separate parole scheme. The decision follows a recent Supreme Court ruling that allowed the government to end that programme.“Deporting people back to these conditions is a death sentence for many, stripping them of their fundamental right to safety and dignity,” said Tessa Pettit, executive director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition.",Hundreds of thousands of Haitians living legally in the United States could soon face deportation.

'Ugly and ignominious death': Trump's 4-word description of what he saved Iran's Khamenei from,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ugly-and-ignominious-death-trumps-4-word-description-of-what-he-saved-irans-khamenei-from/articleshow/122119804.cms,"Donald Trump said he saved Ayatollah Khamenei from 'ugly and ignominious death'





President Doanld Trump once again claimed that he saved the life of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and without his intervention, he would face an ""ugly and ignominious death"". The assertion came as Iran claimed victory and Israel's defence minister Israel Katz claimed that they would have killed Khamenei had he been found without needing any go-ahead from the US. But Khamenei went deep underground and broke off contacts with commanders, the Israeli minister dais adding that they don't need permission from the US.With both sides diminishing the significance of the mediation of the US, Trump again claimed that he saved Khamanei's life as he knew ""exactly"" where he was sheltered.""I SAVED HIM FROM A VERY UGLY AND IGNOMINIOUS DEATH, and he does not have to say, “THANK YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP!” In fact, in the final act of the War, I demanded that Israel bring back a very large group of planes, which were heading directly to Tehran, looking for a big day, perhaps the final knockout! Tremendous damage would have ensued, and many Iranians would have been killed. It was going to be the biggest attack of the War, by far,"" Trump posted on Truth Social.""They are always so angry, hostile, and unhappy, and look at what it has gotten them - A burned out, blown up Country, with no future, a decimated Military, a horrible Economy, and DEATH all around them. They have no hope, and it will only get worse! I wish the leadership of Iran would realize that you often get more with HONEY than you do with VINEGAR. PEACE!!!"" Trump posted. At a press conference Friday, Trump said US would bomb Iran again if there is any further intel about Iran restarting its uranium programs.In his first remarks since the US strikes on Iran;s Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan, Khamenei said US achieved nothing through the strikes.“My congratulations on our dear Iran’s victory over the US regime,” Khamenei wrote early Thursday on social platform X. “The US regime entered the war directly because it felt that if it didn’t, the Zionist regime would be completely destroyed.”“It entered the war in an effort to save that regime but achieved nothing,” he added. Khamanei also noted that it was Iran which delivered a heavy slap to the US face, attacking US airbase in Qatar.",Donald Trump said he saved Ayatollah Khamenei from 'ugly and ignominious death' Khamenei went deep underground and broke off contacts with commanders.

'Without question': Trump says will bomb Iran again if it gets into nukes; says Khamenei got 'beat to hell',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/without-question-trump-says-will-bomb-iran-again-if-it-gets-into-nukes-says-khamenei-got-beat-to-hell/articleshow/122117606.cms,"https://x.com/TruthTrumpPosts/status/1938649165237489704





A day after Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei issued a threat to US, President Donald Trump on Friday told the Shiite state that they got ""beat to hell"" after US bombed its nuclear facilities.Trump also said that he would bomb Iran again ""without question"" if it keeps enriching uranium.Asked in a White House press conference whether he would consider fresh air strikes if last week's sorties were not successful in ending Iran's nuclear ambitions, he said: ""Without question. Absolutely.""Trump said Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ""got beat to hell"" in the hostilities involving the United States and Israel and that ""it was a great time to end it.""This comes a day after Khamenei, in his first televised speech after the attack, warned Iran would target American military bases in the Middle East if the US launched future attacks.""The Islamic Republic slapped America in the face. It attacked one of the important American bases in the region,"" Khamenei said.Khamenei stated that whilst the US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities were ineffective, America intervened primarily to protect Israel after Iranian missiles penetrated Israeli defence systems.He characterised Trump's actions as theatrical, particularly regarding claims about destroying Iran's nuclear programme with 30,000-pound bombs.Meanwhile, Trump also advised Iran to open itself to international inspection to verify it doesn't restart its nuclear programme.Asked during a White House news conference if he would demand during expected talks with Iran that the International Atomic Energy Agency or some other organisation be authorised to conduct inspections, Trump responded the Islamic republic would have to cooperate with the group “or somebody that we respect, including ourselves.”Iran's top diplomat earlier said the possibility of new negotiations with the United States on his country's nuclear program has been “complicated” by the American attack on three of the sites, which he conceded caused “serious damage.""On June 22, the US carried out Operation Midnight Hammer, dropping 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs on three key underground nuclear sites.The attack was designed to deal a critical blow to Iran's uranium enrichment programme, in line with Trump's stance that Iran cannot be allowed to possess nuclear weapons.According to Pentagon figures, more than 125 aircraft participated in the mission, including stealth bombers, support planes, fighters and surveillance craft. A total of 75 precision weapons were used, including 14 bunker busters and over two dozen cruise missiles.","Trump said Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ""got beat to hell"" in the hostilities involving the United States and Israel.

'Iran can never get nukes': US secretary of state Marco Rubio talks tough with PM Shehbaz Sharif; Pakistan criticised strikes on Tehran's nuclear sites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/iran-can-never-get-nukes-us-secretary-of-state-marco-rubio-talks-tough-with-pm-shehbaz-sharif-pakistan-criticised-strikes-on-tehrans-nuclear-sites/articleshow/122103638.cms,"Iran Agrees To Help Pak Defuse Tensions With India After Putin 'SNUBS' Sharif | Details





US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a firm warning to Pakistan on Friday, saying that Iran must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. The statement came during a call with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif amid high tensions in the Middle East.“Secretary Rubio emphasised Iran can never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon,” said US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce.According to Bruce, both leaders “acknowledged the importance of working together to promote a durable peace between Israel and Iran and maintaining regional stability.”The message to Islamabad comes at a sensitive time, as the country has historically tried to balance its ties with both Iran and the West. Rubio’s call comes just days after a major US military strike on Iran’s underground nuclear facilities.The strikes triggered political controversy in Islamabad which had just days earlier recommended US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.The nomination, signed by deputy Prime Minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, praised Trump’s role in easing tensions with India. However, criticism erupted after Islamabad condemned the strikes as a breach of international law.JUI-F leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman demanded the nomination be withdrawn, calling Trump’s peace claims “false” and accusing him of backing Israeli aggression. Opposition figures, including Mushahid Hussain, slammed Trump for starting an “illegal war” and urged the government to revoke the nomination.PTI’s Raoof Hasan said the move brought “shame and embarrassment”, while other leaders, including Maleeha Lodhi and Afrasiab Khattak, labelled it undiplomatic and misguided.Pakistan’s foreign ministry issued a statement defending Iran’s right to self-defence under the UN Charter and warned of regional destabilisation. The backlash reflects a rapid shift from recent praise of Trump’s diplomacy.On June 22, the United States launched airstrikes targeting Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. Three critical sites — Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan — were struck using 30,000-pound GBU-57 “bunker buster” bombs, delivered by stealth B-2 bombers.On President Donald Trump’s orders, US Central Command carried out what the Pentagon described as a “deliberate and precise strike” to “severely degrade Iran’s nuclear weapons infrastructure.”“At approximately 6:40 PM EST, 2:10 am Iran time, the lead B-2 dropped GBU-57 MOP weapons on the first of several aim points at Fordow,” said General Dan Caine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.The military operation followed Israel’s “Operation Rising Lion” on June 13 and Iran’s retaliatory “Operation True Promise 3.”","US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a firm warning to Pakistan on Friday, saying that Iran must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.

A Pakistan military officer who had claimed to have captured Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman was killed in a clash with Taliban militants in the Sararogha area of South Waziristan, near the Afghan border.According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah was killed along with Lance Naik Jibran Ullah during an operation against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters.ISPR added that the Pakistan Army killed 11 TTP militants and wounded seven others in the same operation.Major Moiz’s funeral prayers were held at Chaklala Garrison in Rawalpindi, with Pakistan Army Chief General Asim Munir in attendance.“Major Syed Moiz Abbas fought bravely in the face of resistance and ultimately laid down his life in the line of duty, upholding the highest traditions of bravery, sacrifice, and patriotism,” the ISPR statement quoted Munir as saying.His body was flown to his hometown of Chakwal in Punjab, where he was laid to rest with full military honours.A resurfaced clip of his old interview with Geo TV, now circulating on social media, shows Moiz — then a captain — detailing the events surrounding the capture of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman.Varthaman had shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter in February 2019 before his MiG-21 was hit and he was captured. He was held in Pakistan for three days before being released.The TTP, also known as the Pakistan Taliban, was formed in 2007 as an umbrella group of several militant outfits. Its primary aim is to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic law across Pakistan.Believed to have close ties with al-Qaeda, the TTP has been blamed for numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan, including the 2009 assault on army headquarters, attacks on military bases, and the 2008 bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad.Pakistan has described the TTP as “Fitna al-Khawarij,” referencing a historical Islamic sect known for violent rebellion.",Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah was killed along with Lance Naik Jibran Ullah during an operation against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters.

Is Pakistan building an ICBM?

What is ICBM?

Change in US strategy?





Another growing concern stems from Pakistan. US intelligence agencies have assessed that Pakistan is actively developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the continental United States.According to a report by, the Pakistani military is pursuing a nuclear-armed ICBM, particularly in the wake of Operation Sindoor that took place in May.While Islamabad maintains that its nuclear program is aimed solely at deterring India—its conventionally superior neighbor—US intelligence agencies have assessed that Pakistan is actively developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the continental United States.By pursuing such long-range capabilities, Pakistan may be attempting to deter potential US actions—whether a preemptive strike on its nuclear facilities or intervention in a future conflict with India.ICBM is a long-range missile with a reach exceeding 5,500 kilometers (3,400 miles), primarily designed to deliver nuclear payloads—typically one or more thermonuclear warheads. While ICBMs are theoretically capable of carrying conventional, chemical, or biological weapons, such payloads have never been operationally deployed on these systems.Modern ICBMs often feature multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), enabling a single missile to deliver several warheads to different targets simultaneously.Countries currently known to possess operational ICBMs include the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Israel, and North Korea. Pakistan, despite being a nuclear-armed nation, remained the only such state without an ICBM capability.Advancements in missile technology, such as those seen in second- and third-generation systems like the US LGM-118 Peacekeeper, significantly increased accuracy, allowing ICBMs to hit even small, fortified targets with high reliability.ICBMs stand apart from other ballistic missile classes due to their extended range and faster speed. They surpass intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs), medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs), short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), and tactical ballistic missiles in both capability and strategic impact.US officials have pointed out, the acquisition of ICBMs capable of targeting American territory would compel Washington to categorize Pakistan as a nuclear threat. Historically, no nation with such reach has been treated as an ally by the United States. In effect, the threat of nuclear escalation now shadows every region central to US strategic interests.While each emerging nuclear adversary—Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran—poses a significant threat on its own, the prospect of coordination or strategic collusion among them presents a far more alarming challenge.","According to a report by, the Pakistani military is pursuing a nuclear-armed ICBM.
