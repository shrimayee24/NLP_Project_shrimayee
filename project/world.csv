Rane claimed, ""Salman Khan is more of a Hindu than Uddhav Thackeray. He had the courage to attend the RSS program.""

Azmi’s remarks came after Salman Khan attended the RSS Mumbai Vyakhyanmala event on Saturday, part of a two-day lecture series titled “100 Years of Sangh Journey: New Horizons.” The actor’s presence at the event has since sparked a political debate, drawing reactions from leaders across party lines.Defending Khan, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde dismissed the controversy and urged political leaders not to politicise the issue. He said there was nothing unusual about the actor attending the programme, emphasising that Khan, as an Indian citizen, had every right to be present at such events.“Whether Salman Khan went to an RSS programme or not, why should this even be questioned? Salman Khan is an Indian citizen. He follows Indian culture — Ganpati comes to his house, and his entire family believes in these traditions. I don’t think there is anything wrong with this. In fact, it is absolutely right,” Shinde said, adding that unnecessary politics should not be made out of the matter.Maharashtra minister Nitesh Rane also came out in support of the actor, while trading barbs on Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray.",Samajwadi Party leader Abu Azmi alleges that the Bollywood star may have attended the event under pressure.

NEW DELHI: Women MPs from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla , urging him to take strict action against opposition MPs for allegedly committing “heinous acts” inside the House during last week’s proceedings.In their letter, the MPs praised the Speaker for maintaining order and decorum during the discussion on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address on February 4, but accused opposition of creating chaos.""We wish to express our profound gratitude and admiration for the exemplary manner in which you upheld and protected the dignity, decorum, and sanctity of the Lok Sabha during the discussion on the Motion of Thanks on the Honourable President's Address on February 4, 2026. On that day, the entire House, and indeed the entire nation, witnessed one of the most unfortunate and regrettable incidents inside the Lok Sabha chamber,"" the letter stated.Detailing the alleged misconduct, the BJP MPs claimed that opposition MPs disrupted proceedings in an unprecedented manner.""We saw members of the opposition party not only entering the well of the House but also climbing onto the Speaker's table, tearing up papers, and throwing them towards the Speaker.Furthermore, sadly, some Honourable women members, behaving aggressively and carrying banners and placards, crossed over to the other side. They not only surrounded the Prime Minister's seat but also entered the Treasury benches where senior ministers sit,"" the letter said.“Therefore, we urge you to take the strictest possible action, under the rules, against those opposition MPs who have committed such heinous acts within the House premises and brought disrepute to our democratic institution,” it added.The BJP MPs’ letter comes a day after women MPs from the Congress wrote to Birla accusing him of acting under pressure from the ruling party to justify Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s absence from the House.The controversy stems from Birla’s statement in the Lok Sabha last week that he had received “concrete information” suggesting that several Congress members might approach the Prime Minister’s seat and carry out an “unexpected act.” The Speaker said he had, therefore, requested the Prime Minister not to attend the House to deliver his reply to the Motion of Thanks.In their letter, Congress women MPs strongly objected to the Speaker’s remarks and accused him of making baseless allegations.“Clearly pressured by the ruling party to defend the non-appearance of the Prime Minister, the Speaker issued a statement making grave allegations against the women MPs of the party,” the Congress MPs said.“We are being targeted simply because we have consistently fought against Prime Minister Narender Modi’s anti-people government and demanded accountability from him. His absence from the House was not due to any threat from us, it was an act of fear,” the letter added.The Congress MPs further rejected any suggestion that they had planned to disrupt proceedings.“He (PM) did not have the courage to face the Opposition. We are Members of Parliament from the Indian National Congress, a party that stands for love, peace, constitutional values, and human dignity. We do not believe in violence and intimidation. We are brave women elected representatives who will not be silenced by intimidation,” the letter, signed by MPs including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Jyothimani, R Sudha, Varsha Gaikwad and Jyotsna Mahant, stated.“We believe that transparency is the only way to restore the dignity of the Speaker’s office and the credibility of this House,” it said.The Congress MPs also alleged bias in disciplinary action, pointing out that eight INDIA bloc MPs were suspended at the “behest of the ruling party,” while a BJP MP was allowed to speak in a “vulgar and obscene manner” about former prime ministers.",Women MPs from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla.

BENGALURU: A 37-year-old Indian-origin tech professional from Karnataka was shot dead by unidentified assailants in a brazen daylight attack at the parking lot of a busy shopping mall in Toronto Saturday.The victim has been identified as Chandan Kumar Raja Nandakumar, a resident of Brampton in the Greater Toronto Area and a native of Thyamagondlu village near Nelamangala, Bengaluru Rural district.In Thyamagondlu, about 47 km from Bengaluru, Chandan's parents were struggling to come to terms with the loss of their only son. ""We spoke to him last Friday. He said he would take leave and come home this summer. We were planning for his marriage. We are completely shattered,"" his father Nandakumar said.No arrests have been made so far. Police in Toronto have launched a homicide investigation, suspecting a ""targeted"" attack. Some relatives suspect Chandan's efforts to form a Kannada association in Toronto could have played a role in the killing, though police have not indicated any motive so far.A computer science graduate from Sapthagiri College, Bengaluru, Chandan had moved to Canada about six years ago and was working with LTI Mindtree, a subsidiary of L&T.Earlier, he had worked with Cognizant in Bengaluru.The killing has sent shockwaves through the Indian diaspora in Canada. This is Toronto's third homicide this year and has triggered grief and outrage among Kannadigas, both in Canada and Karnataka.Family members said Chandan had repeatedly postponed his return to India. ""Had he listened to us and returned, he would have been with us now,"" Nandakumar lamented.Chandan was seated inside his SUV when the attackers opened fire near the entrance to Woodbine Shopping Centre, close to Rexdale Boulevard, around 3.30 pm (local time).According to an official release from Toronto Police Service (TPS), officers rushed to the spot after receiving reports of a shooting and found Chandan with multiple gunshot wounds. ""He was transported to a hospital with life-threatening injuries before he succumbed to the wounds,"" family members told TOI, quoting the TPS communication.Visuals from the scene showed Chandan's white car riddled with bullet holes, prompting investigators to treat the incident as a ""targeted"" attack. The suspects fled the scene in a vehicle.TPS Inspector Errol Watson said the incident raised public safety concerns. ""I can understand how a shooting like this, especially at a mall, can cause concern for the safety of the public,"" he told the media.Condoling the incident, Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara said: ""We are disturbed by the incident. We have lost a Kannadiga. Our police department has already sought the help of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) to bring back the body.""Chikkaballapura MP Dr K Sudhakar said he was coordinating with MEA authorities to facilitate the repatriation of Chandan's body.Friends said he was actively involved in Kannada cultural circles in Toronto, promoting Kannada films, music and community events.His uncle Murali Krishna said the family was unable to understand the motive behind the killing. ""He built a stable life abroad and was working hard. He was the only son.

Since this dispute began, the number has come down to just 12 or 15,"" Kumar told news agency PTI, adding that many regulars were staying away to avoid being drawn into the tension.The dispute began on January 26 when Bajrang Dal activists staged a protest outside the ‘Baba’ clothing store on Patel Marg, demanding that its 70-year-old owner, Vakil Ahmed, change the shop’s name. Clashes broke out between the protesters, Ahmed, and Kumar, who is a friend of Ahmed’s son, prompting police intervention.On January 31, a larger group of activists again gathered outside the shop and Kumar’s gym, blocked the road and raised slogans.The situation was brought under control by the police, who later registered three separate FIRs in connection with the incidents.Tensions flared again after a video circulated by the Hindu Raksha Dal showed a man threatening to march to Kotdwara on February 12 to “teach Deepak a lesson”.The local administration has stepped up security to prevent further escalation. Additional Superintendent of Police Chandra Mohan Singh said no one would be allowed to disturb peace in the town and warned of strict action against those attempting to incite trouble.","Deepak Kumar, 42, who runs the 'Hulk' gym said his business has suffered since he confronted Bajrang Dal activists protesting against a garment shop.

'Either Naravane Or Penguin Is Lying': Rahul Gandhi Reacts To Publisher's Statement On Memoir

What Penguin said

What is the controversial excerpt?

NEW DELHI: Former Indian Army chief Manoj Mukund Naravane, whose unpublished memoir has triggered a major political controversy, on Tuesday backed his publisher Penguin’s statement on the matter.“This is the status of the book,” Naravane wrote on X, sharing a screenshot of Penguin’s statement.General (retired) Naravane’s reaction came a day after the Delhi Police registered an FIR over the circulation of his book, ""Four Stars of Destiny."" An excerpt from the unpublished memoir was sought to be quoted by Lok Sabha leader of opposition and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi in the House on February 2, but he was blocked by the treasury benches, triggering the controversy.The treasury benches argued that House rules do not permit members to cite unpublished material. They also pointed out to Gandhi that he was not speaking on the listed subject — the Motion of Thanks to President Droupadi Murmu’s address, which marked the commencement of Parliament’s Budget session on January 28.The controversy has led to repeated adjournments of the Lok Sabha. Opposition parties have moved a no-confidence motion seeking the removal of Speaker Om Birla, accusing him of repeatedly siding with the government and “blocking” Gandhi from speaking at the government’s behest.As the controversy escalated, Penguin said in a statement on Monday: “We hold the sole publishing rights for the book Four Stars of Destiny. We wish to make it clear that the book has not gone into publication. No copies have been made available to the public by Penguin Random House India. Any copies currently in circulation constitute an infringement of PRHI’s copyright and must immediately be ceased. PRHI shall be exercising remedies available in law against the illegal and unauthorised dissemination of the book. ”The memoir is yet to be vetted by the Ministry of Defence.The excerpt was published by an online portal. In it, Naravane, who was the 28th Chief of Army Staff from December 2019 to April 2022, quotes defence minister Rajnath Singh as conveying Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s message: “Jo uchit samjho woh karo” (take whatever action you deem appropriate).The purported remarks were made in August 2020, at the height of the India–China military standoff in eastern Ladakh.The Opposition has claimed that the vagueness of the alleged instructions amounted to an “abdication” of responsibility by PM Modi during the crisis.",General (retired) Naravane’s reaction came a day after the Delhi Police registered an FIR over the circulation of his book.

There was only one woman advocate out of over 100 lawyers appointed. He said the absence of such representation in the advocate general’s office had long-term implications for the legal profession, as govt law officers often go on to be considered for elevation as judges.‘There is no representation of the people we are representing,” Thakur said.The lawyer appearing for the state assured the bench that the concerns would be communicated to the advocate general.","Not a single advocate from the ST community had ever been appointed as a govt lawyer in Madhya Pradesh HC.

"Opposition, barring TMC, submits notice for removal of Speaker",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-barring-tmc-submits-notice-for-removal-of-speaker/articleshow/128176312.cms,"No-Confidence Against Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla Explained: Process, Rules And Numbers In Parliament

Draft resolution accuses Birla of ‘openly backing ruling party’

New Delhi: Accusing Speaker Om Birla of ""blatant partisanship"" in the running of the Lok Sabha, a joint opposition barring Trinamool Congress Tuesday submitted a notice for his removal from office, escalating the simmering tensions between the govt and the opposition to a point that raises questions about the future of their working relationship.Birla has decided to stay away from the LS proceedings till the no-confidence resolution is settled. He could have continued until the resolution was formally moved in the House. There are indications that the motion against him would now be taken up on March 9 when Parliament is scheduled to convene after the recess. The twin prompt moves reflect a desire to take the moral high ground as well as confidence in NDA's numbers.The notice under Article 94 (c) - signed by 119 MPs - was submitted to the Lok Sabha secretary general by Gaurav Gogoi, K Suresh and Mohammed Jawed Tuesday afternoon, after the presiding officer did not again allow Rahul Gandhi to speak at the start of the proceedings and then at the start of zero hour, which both led to adjournments.Om Birla had objected to Gandhi insisting on citing the unpublished book of Gen M M Naravane to attack the govt.It was suggested that the leader of the opposition’s brief remarks about the opposition’s grievances would be followed by their cooperation to start the stalled discussion on the Budget.The short draft resolution attached to the removal notice for discussion in the House accuses Birla of “openly espousing the version of the ruling party (sic) on all controversial matters”.The anti-BJP camp clinched the fraught move against the Chair within a day of floating it at a meeting that was called to brainstorm on the future course of action in the wake of the govt-Chair’s repeated refusal to allow Gandhi to speak so long as he did not commit not to cite from the memoir of the retired general, which was behind the protests and the logjam. It marked an alacrity of action not seen in the INDIA bloc’s strategic moves in the 18th Lok Sabha. The bigwigs of the bloc signed the notice — Akhilesh Yadav and Dharmendra Yadav (SP), T R Baalu (DMK), N K Premachandran (RSP), E T Mohd Basheer (IUML), Aga Syed Ruhullah Mehdi (NC), Nilesh Lanke (NCP), Misha Bharti (RJD), and members of JMM among others.While K C Venugopal and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra among other MPs signed for Congress, Rahul Gandhi as LoP did not put his name to the notice. Sena UBT misssed signing the petition owing to miscommunication over the timing of submission.However, TMC stood out for its objection to the initiation of the extreme step at this stage, with Abhishek Banerjee telling reporters that the opposition should exhaust other steps before resorting to “no confidence”. As reported by TOI, he suggested that the opposition write a letter to the Speaker first. While denying any objection to the move, Banerjee argued that a nuanced approach was preferable, citing that TMC’s push for impeachment of CEC Gyanesh Kumar has come only after the party has gone to court, met the watchdog and also written to him. A Trinamool neta even said the party would sign the notice if the opposition waited till Thursday.The notice has listed the stormy events of the ongoing budget session as evidence of Birla’s “partisan manner”. It starts with the Chair’s denial of permission to Rahul Gandhi to speak on Feb 2 on former Army chief M M Naravane’s book about the 2020 Chinese aggression as part of his speech on the motion of thanks. The other complaints include Birla’s observation — made a day after PM Modi’s no-show for his scheduled response to the motion of thanks — that female MPs from Congress posed a threat to the PM which could have resulted in an “unprecedented incident”; suspension of eight opposition MPs; and permission to a BJP MP (Nishikant Dubey) to “make wholly objectionable and personalised attacks” on two former PMs without any reprimand, and the absence of action against him as demanded by the opposition.",Om Birla has decided to stay away from the LS proceedings till the no-confidence resolution is settled.

JAMMU: Nearly 10 months after Operation Sindoor , there has been no progress on constructing bunkers in the border areas of Jammu and Kashmir that witnessed heavy Pakistani shelling, including Poonch, where at least 18 people were killed.“No stone has been moved in Uri after the operation,” Sajjad Shafi, MLA from the Uri constituency in Baramulla district, told TOI. Shafi said a number of houses were damaged during the shelling, forcing large-scale evacuations. While the evacuations saved lives, assurances about constructing bunkers had not been honoured, the MLA said. “Our topography makes community bunkers difficult to access during intense shelling. Every house should have its own bunker,” he said.Echoing the need for individual bunkers, Muzaffar Iqbal Khan, MLA from Thanamandi in Rajouri, said: “Houses are kilometres apart. No one can step out during shelling to reach a community bunker.”Poonch MLA Ajaz Jan of NC said: “When shelling takes place, the Army is forced to first focus on evacuating civilians and rescuing the injured before responding. Permanent bunkers would strengthen defence and reduce pressure on security forces,” he said.According to officials over 500 bunkers have been sanctioned for Uri by MHA and work on them is expected to begin in April 2026. In Nov 2025, the J&K administration had said a proposal to set up 5,693 bunkers in Poonch had been submitted for approval to MHA.","Nearly 10 months after Operation Sindoor, there has been no progress on constructing bunkers in the border areas of Jammu and Kashmir.

Ajit Pawar Dead In Barimati Crash: Eyewitness Details Explosions; PM Reacts, Nation Stunned

NEW DELHI: NCP (SP) leader Rohit Pawar on Tuesday suggested that the death of Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar in a plane crash could have been part of a larger conspiracy, as several questions surrounding the incident remain unanswered.Rohit Pawar made the remarks during a presentation in Mumbai on the air crash that killed Ajit Pawar and four others last month. While briefing on the incident, he said that the circumstances leading up to the crash warranted closer scrutiny.“Ajit Dada’s plane crash could be a part of a conspiracy. We also investigated certain aspects of the accident. A book mentions that if someone wants to kill a person, the easiest way is to target the driver. The day before the accident, Dada was supposed to travel from Mumbai to Pune by car, and the convoy had also started. But why did he not leave by car? Ajit Dada was also scheduled to meet a senior leader,” Rohit Pawar said.He alleged that there were serious doubts about the aircraft, the pilot and the handling company. Rohit said that the crash warranted scrutiny beyond routine procedures.He questioned the credentials of the pilot who flew the aircraft on the day of the crash.The NCP (SP) leader referred to Capt Sumit Kapoor, who was piloting the Learjet and cited his past suspension.“Capt Sumit Kapoor had earlier been suspended for three years for alcohol consumption. This raises serious questions,” he said, while adding that the pilot’s role needed thorough examination.Rohit Pawar also raised concerns over the investigation process, arguing that existing agencies may not be sufficient to clear all doubts.“The AAIB functions under the DGCA. There is a need for an independent and comprehensive probe by multiple expert agencies, including international bodies,” he said, naming agencies such as the National Transportation Safety Board, the UK-based Air Accidents Investigation Branch, along with Indian authorities.He further alleged that VSR Company, which owned the Learjet aircraft, wielded influence over aviation regulators.“The final probe report of the 2023 crash involving a VSR company aircraft has already been submitted. Even now, VSR company planes continue to be used by high-ranking political leaders. Why was the company’s licence never cancelled?” Rohit Pawar asked.Stating that the tragedy could not be dismissed as an accident, he added, “We do not believe this was a mere accident. There is room to suspect sabotage.”""Entire Maharashtra is questioning whether Ajit Dada’s plane crash was an accident or a conspiracy? I am sharing with you all what I feel. Some people are still expecting dada to come from somewhere, some say 6 people were in aircraft, it was not Ajit dada’s dead body, it still feels like a nightmare,"" Rohit said.Rohit Pawar also flagged multiple technical and operational issues, including whether the aircraft’s transponder was switched off, why a difficult runway was chosen despite poor visibility, and why the aircraft attempted landing under such conditions.“Why did the pilot demand Runway 11? Why did he attempt to land despite visibility issues? Why did he remain silent when the aircraft tilted?” he asked.He further said that Ajit Pawar was scheduled to travel to Pune by road on the evening of January 27 after a cabinet meeting and that his convoy had already been readied.“However, a leader from East Vidarbha arrived with a file related to scrapping a political consultant’s contract, which delayed the meeting. The aircraft booking was done late at night. Ajitdada was scheduled to take off at 7 am, yet the plane departed only at 8.10 am,” Rohit Pawar said.Ajit Pawar was killed on January 28 when a chartered Learjet aircraft crashed while attempting to land at the table-top airstrip in Baramati, Pune district.Four others, including his personal security officer, the pilot, co-pilot and a flight attendant, also lost their lives in the crash. The Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti elections in Maharashtra were postponed following the incident.Notably, NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar has earlier ruled out any conspiracy and described the incident as an accident.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee earlier alleged that Ajit Pawar’s death could be linked to a political conspiracy and demanded a Supreme Court-monitored investigation, citing reports that he was considering rejoining the NCP (SP) led by Sharad Pawar.Meanwhile, the Union government has said that a technical investigation is under way. Minister of state for civil aviation Murlidhar Mohol said that the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) were examining the crash.“The black box has been recovered and is being analysed. The data will be downloaded, followed by a detailed inquiry. A preliminary report will be released after that,” Mohol said, urging caution against drawing premature conclusions.Authorities have said the investigation is being conducted under the AAIB Rules, 2025 and will determine the exact sequence of events, including the role of weather and visibility conditions during the aircraft’s attempted landing.The Maharashtra Crime Investigation Department (CID) has also initiated a parallel investigation, while Pune Rural Police have registered a case of accidental death and transferred it to the CID.","Rohit Pawar made the remarks during a presentation in Mumbai on the air crash.

From Rohit Shetty to Ranveer Singh: Extortion wave hits Bollywood; 1990s underworld fears resurface,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/actor-ranveer-singh-receives-bishnoi-gang-voice-message-demanding-crores/articleshow/128170459.cms,"Shots Fired Outside Rohit Shetty’s Bungalow In Mumbai, Cops Detain Five





MUMBAI: A fortnight after gunshots were fired outside filmmaker Rohit Shetty's residence in Juhu, actor Ranveer Singh was learnt to have received a threat accompanied by a demand for several crores.Sources said the threat was sent as a WhatsApp voice note from an unidentified number to Singh's secretary. The sender claimed to be speaking on behalf of the Bishnoi gang.Security around Singh's residence was increased after the voice note, said police sources.In a related development, the managing committee of the Beau Monde residential tower in Prabhadevi approached the Dadar police station about the deployment of six armed private security guards without the permission of the society at the flat occupied by Singh and his actor wife Deepika Padukone. In a written communication, the society said suddenly now a uniformed police official was also seen stationed with the actors.Though senior police officials remained tight-lipped on the extortion matter, sources said Singh was not an isolated target. Over the past 15 days, about a dozen Bollywood personalities are said to have received threatening calls from people who identified themselves as members of the Bishnoi gang.No complaint or FIR has been registered so far by any of the threatened celebrities.The latest threat comes even as the crime branch is struggling to nab the unidentified shooter who fired five rounds outside Shetty's home last month.On Feb 5, TOI was the first to report the surge in threat calls undert the headline ‘5 More Bollywood celebrities targeted by Lonkar: Cops'.Investigators said that soon after the firing at Shetty's house, several Bollywood figures began receiving extortion calls. Most of them reportedly blocked unknown numbers or stopped answering unfamiliar calls altogether.Even Singh's secretary is believed to have blocked unknown callers, which may have prompted the extortionist to send a voice note directly to the assistant's phone.The growing menace of the Bishnoi gang — particularly after the firing outside Salman Khan's residence, the murder of NCP leader Baba Siddiqui last year, and the attack on Shetty's house — has gripped Mumbai's film fraternity with fear, evoking memories of the 1990s and early 2000s when underworld influence, shootouts and threat calls were rampant.At least nine teams of the crime branch are camping in Lucknow and adjoining towns in Uttar Pradesh to track down the shooter involved in the Shetty firing case. A police official told TOI that the shooter had been identified and digitally tracked to Lucknow, and efforts are underway to arrest him at the earliest.",Ranveer Singh received a threat accompanied by a demand for several crores.

FARRUKHABAD/MAINPURI: Around 120 students were hospitalised in Farrukhabad and Mainpuri districts after falling ill during a deworming drive at their schools, officials said. The children reported headache and vomiting shortly after being given Albendazole tablets.In Farrukhabad, the incident took place on Tuesday at Jawahar Lal Prema Devi School in Rathora Mohaddinpur village of Kamalganj block. Of the nearly 150 students who received the tablets, around 100 began feeling unwell, causing concern among parents and school authorities, according to news agency PTI.Officials said 33 students were admitted to the Community Health Centre in Kamalganj, while 67 others were shifted to Lohia Hospital at the district headquarters.District Magistrate Ashutosh Kumar Dwivedi visited Lohia Hospital to review the situation and instructed doctors to ensure proper treatment for the children.Chief medical Officer Dr Avanindra Kumar said the deworming campaign was conducted in schools across the district.""Students of this particular school complained of headache and vomiting. All are stable and their condition is now normal,"" Dr Kumar said.The district magistrate said the tablets were distributed across the district, but reports of discomfort came only from this school.

GAURIBIDANUR: In a strange incident, one of the thieves who broke into a locked house in Gauribidanur town, Chikkaballapur district, was found fast asleep on the floor hours later, unable to find his way out after the burglary.The incident unfolded around 12.30am Sunday in a quiet neighbourhood near the old RTO Layout. Neighbours noticed two men climbing onto the roof of the house of Premanath, who runs an eatery in the town.Premanath had left for Hyderabad with family after locking the house. The intruders cut open an asbestos sheet on the roof to gain entry. By the time neighbours gathered and surrounded the house, one of the intruders managed to escape. The second man, identified as Devaraj, allegedly got trapped inside. Police said Devaraj, who was intoxicated, was unable to climb back through the roof opening and failed to find another exit from the locked house.Believing that both thieves were still inside, residents raised an alarm and sealed the damaged roof from outside. Locals kept watch through the night to prevent any escape attempt. Unnoticed by them, Devaraj remained inside the house and eventually fell asleep on the floor.Premanath, meanwhile, rushed back to Gauribidanur around 8.30am Monday. When he unlocked the door and entered with a few neighbours, they were shocked to find Devaraj asleep as if nothing had happened.Devaraj later admitted to taking Rs 5,000 in cash from the house, which he returned. He claimed unpaid wages drove him to steal, stating he'd earlier worked as a painter.Devaraj, however, denied knowledge of any accomplice even as neighbours insisted they had seen two men on the roof.

CEO clarifies progeny rule





HYDERABAD: Married women in Telangana may turn out to be one of the largest groups to find names missing from the electoral rolls when the Election Commission starts its Special Intensive Revision (SIR) later this year.Those involved in the pre-SIR mapping exercise in the state say more men are being mapped than women as booth level officers (BLO) start comparing names with the 2002 electoral rolls. Among them, married women are the most difficult to track, especially those born between July 1, 1987 and Dec 2, 2004. The exercise has so far mapped 53% of the voters overall across Telangana and just 28% in Hyderabad.Sources add that in many cases the women are being wrongly mapped as ‘progeny' in their marital home, creating complex technical issues.As per the Election Commission guidelines, married women must be linked to their maternal home (puttinillu in Telugu) rather than their marital home (mettinillu). Political parties allege that this is disrupting the usual family mapping route, where a wife is mapped with her husband within the same household.Sources told TOI that the anomaly of booth level officers inaccurately mapping married women with their marital home is due to lack of understanding or training.Senior officials told TOI that a married woman's vote will not be in the same booth or the same constituency in the 2002 election rolls as the rest of her family. In the first instance, it is difficult to trace her vote in 2002. If it is not traced, the names of her parents must be traced. If they are not traced, she must produce documents proving linkages to her maternal home.When the actual SIR exercise begins, women who migrated to other parts of the state after getting married years or decades ago do not have ready access to electoral details of their parents. If they are not listed in the 2002 rolls and fail to provide progeny linkages, they may receive notices asking for documents during the actual SIR, likely to begin in Telangana in April or May.AIMIM joint secretary S A Hussain Anwar, in a representation to the Telangana chief electoral officer , stated, ""Errors are occurring during progeny mapping of married women, where booth level officers are incorrectly linking daughters-in-law to fathers-in-law and wives to husbands, under the mistaken assumption that all members residing in the same household fall within the same progeny category.""He added that these relationships do not fall under permissible progeny categories according to Election Commission norms. BLO applications are only allowed to map son, daughter, grandson, and granddaughter as progeny. ""Daughters-in-law are not valid ‘progeny' entries in the app, making such linkages technically invalid,"" he added.Telangana chief electoral officer C Sudharshan Reddy told TOI that married women cannot be treated as progeny within the husband's family line. ""Sister and brother who are children of a voter are progenies. Married women in their maternal household are not a progeny of electors there. She will be mapped with her parents. Married women below 40 will be linked to parents or, once SIR starts, they will be given the papers to be filled up and submitted with supporting documents,"" he said.","Married women in Telangana may turn out to be one of the largest groups to find names missing from the electoral rolls when the Election Commission starts its Special Intensive Revision (SIR) later this year.

'He was entering the middle of our call': Lawrence Bishnoi gang claims Delhi bizman killed in Bawana for ‘interfering in their work’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bizman-murdered-for-interfering-in-work-claims-lawrence-gang/articleshow/128170483.cms,"



NEW DELHI: The Lawrence Bishnoi gang allegedly claimed responsibility for the daylight murder of a 35-year-old businessman in northwest Delhi's Bawana. Accusing the trader of ""interfering in their work"", the gang warned against any hurdles in its operations, saying it would now shoot the guilty without intimation.The authenticity of the claim, posted on social media, is being verified. The account used to post the claim is new and not the usual one used by the gang, sources said.Lawrence and other gangs usually fire at a target's car and house to scare them into paying money. The brazen killing, if for extortion, would be new for the city.While police are probing the involvement of the Lawrence gang, a robbery gone wrong is also a strong line of probe. Sources said the shooters might have been tipped off about a cash movement in the businessman's car and targeted him. The shooters allegedly asked for Rs 1-1.5 crore at the spot and even peeked into the targ-et's car, in which some cash was allegedly kept.The victim, identified as Vaibhav Gandhi, was a plastic granules manufacturer who was chased and shot on Monday afternoon near his factory in Sector 4 in the industrial area.The cops suspect the involvement of some Haryana-based shooters based on their movement after the crime.Other angles being explored are the possibility of a business rivalry or a misunderstanding where the Lawrence gang mistakenly identified the victim as a hawala trader who had a dispute with it over a payment of Rs 1-1.5 crore in a case involving another businessman, an investigator said.The latest claim surfaced via a social media post authored by an account under the name ‘Randeep Malik Anil Pandit'. In the post, which features a picture of Lawrence wearing a hoodie, the perpetrators stated that they had carried out the killing on behalf of the Lawrence Bishnoi, Jitender Gogi Maan, Hasim Baba and Kala Rana groups.The message, written in a mix of Hindi and English, alleged that Gandhi was ""interfering"" in their operations. ""He was entering the middle of our call, so we exited him from his life,"" the post read, adding a warning that anyone else who attempts to obstruct their ""work"" will be eliminated without prior notice or call.The murder occurred around 12.51pm on Monday when Gandhi was inside his car outside the factory. According to preliminary police investigations, four assailants on bikes approached him and one of them started firing from a pistol.When Gandhi tried to flee, the gunmen chased him for nearly 50 metres, firing multiple rounds. A fatal shot to the chin caused him to collapse, after which the attackers fled with his belongings, including a laptop bag.","Lawrence Bishnoi gang claims responsibility for daylight murder of 35-year-old businessman in northwest Delhi's Bawana.

Kanpur Lamborghini Crash: Accused's Lawyer Claims Driver Was Behind the Wheel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/tobacco-barons-son-was-not-behind-wheel-says-lawyer/articleshow/128173989.cms,"In a Kanpur Lamborghini crash probe, the accused's lawyer claims the driver was behind the wheel, not Shivam Mishra, who is reportedly hospitalized in Delhi





KANPUR: The Kanpur Lamborghini crash case is heating up with conflicting claims, with accused Shivam Mishra's lawyer claiming his driver was behind the wheel, while police insisting the tobacco baron's son was indeed driving the Rs 10-crore car.Shivam's lawyer Dharmendra Singh Dharmu claimed that the car was being driven by his driver Mohan at the time of the incident. Countering his claim, Police Commissioner Raghubir Lal said the FIR initially did not mention the driver’s name because the identity of the person driving the vehicle was not clear. He said evidence gathered so far, including CCTV footage and eyewitness statements, confirmed Shivam was driving the high-end car.DCP (Central) Atul Kumar Srivastava stated that CCTV footage from the site identified the person extracted from the vehicle as Shivam. Senior officials pointed out a video showing Shivam being pulled out from the driver's seat post-collision.Meanwhile, finance minister Suresh Khanna told the media in Lucknow that chief minister Yogi Adityanath has ordered strict action in the case. Anyone found guilty will not be spared, he said.On Tuesday, two petitions were filed in the court of ACJM 7 in the case. Mishra's driver, Mohan, has applied to be taken into judicial custody, while the car owner has sought for the vehicle’s release. The court has sought a report from the police on both petitions, and the hearing has been scheduled for Wednesday.Dharmu said Shivam is currently unconscious and admitted to a hospital in Delhi due to dizziness.Shivam’s father and tobacco baron KK Mishra also rejected claims that his son was driving the Lamborghini when the crash took place Sunday afternoon, saying a hired driver was at the wheel when the vehicle malfunctioned, injuring some people and damaging other vehicles.He said the car was being driven by driver Mohan, while Shivam was sitting beside him. “My son’s condition deteriorated rapidly. By the time he reached home, he was unconscious. We immediately sent him to Delhi, where he is currently undergoing treatment under medical supervision,” he said.Stating that they would fully cooperate in the investigation, he denied allegations of overspeeding and intoxication, saying Shivam suffered from epilepsy and was admitted to a hospital in Delhi.""The Police Commissioner is wrong if he says that Shivam was driving the car. No one in our family consumes alcohol or any other stuff,"" he said.New CCTV footage emerged on Tuesday showing Shivam’s bouncers exiting a black SUV and running towards the Lamborghini Revuelto car to extract him from the car. Another video showed a bouncer purportedly carrying Shivam in his arms.Police teams visited Mishra’s residence in Arya Nagar to serve notice, but were unable to establish contact, an official said.The Lamborghini, allegedly being driven at a high speed, triggered chaos on a busy stretch in Kanpur after it rammed into a parked motorcycle and an autorickshaw at Gwal Toli police station area, leaving at least three people injured and several vehicles damaged on Sunday afternoon.The car, bearing a Delhi registration, first collided with an autorickshaw. After the initial impact, the car reportedly accelerated further, lost control near a turn and went on to hit a parked motorcycle owned by Arya Nagar resident Vishal Tripathi, who was standing nearby and talking to someone.In the ensuing chaos, three people, including Chaman Ganj Ghosiyana resident Taufiq, sustained injuries while trying to escape the speeding vehicle. They said the car mounted the motorcycle’s front wheel and dragged it for some distance before hitting an electric pole and coming to a halt.","Accused Shivam Mishra's lawyer claims his driver was behind the wheel of the car.

KANPUR: HDFC Bank employee Astha Singh, whose video of a verbal spat with a man recently went viral on social media, on Tuesday said the incident has been “misrepresented” and clarified that it was not related to any customer.Singh said the altercation involved her colleague’s husband, who she alleged misbehaved with her. She added that her reference to her caste was made only after she was prompted, and asserted that she is proud of her Thakur background. Singh also said she plans to take legal action over what she described as a misrepresentation of the incident.“This incident has been misrepresented and is not related to any customer. The matter involves my colleague's husband, who misbehaved with me, and the video was my response to that behaviour. I mentioned my caste only because I was asked to. I am a Thakur and proud of it,” Astha said according to ANI.She expressed disappointment over the episode being portrayed as one involving “casteism,” saying it had harmed her reputation on social media. She added that she would initiate legal proceedings against the man.“Unfortunately, the matter is being given a different colour. The colleague I was referring to is a Brahmin. I will certainly take legal action, as this has damaged my image on social media,” she said.According to Singh, the man had also argued with other staff members at the bank regarding his wife’s request for same-day relief after submitting her resignation. She said her exchange with him was recorded and later circulated online.“She had come to submit her resignation and wanted same-day relief, over which her husband had a banter with almost everyone. He faced me too in the same frustration and disrespected me. So he had a brawl with everyone; it's just that mine went viral,” she said.In the viral video, Astha Singh is seen expressing anger during an argument with a man, while other bank employees attempt to calm her down. “To hell with you.

MEERUT: An interfaith couple's planned wedding in Meerut landed in a major row after police registered an FIR against the groom under the UP unlawful religious conversion law following allegations of ""love jihad"" by right-wing groups.The couple — Akanksha Gautam, who follows Buddhism and works with a private bank, and Shahvez Rana, a medical professional, from another community — was scheduled to marry on Feb 13. Both are in their mid-20s and belong to Meerut city. Following news of their wedding, members of the outfit protested and, accompanied by Akanksha's uncle, Premchand Gautam, filed a complaint at the city's Ganga Nagar thana.Meerut SP (rural), Abhijeet Kumar, said, ""A case was registered against the accused man at the behest of the woman's kin under BNS section 351 (3) (criminal intimidation), along with sections of the Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act. No arrests have been made so far.""In his complaint, Akanksha's uncle alleged deception and raised concerns about the groom's name being mentioned differently on the wedding card. ""Akanksha was misled by ‘Sahil', whose real name is Shahvez Rana. He deceived her with the intention of grabbing property and conspired to marry her after manipulating and brainwashing her. I fear for my niece's safety,"" he stated.Objecting to right-wing groups' interference, Akanksha, ""My family is fine with the marriage, and so is Sahil's.So who gave these outfits the right to interfere in my matters? Because of all this ruckus, it has given me a lot of stress. If anything happens to me, they will be held responsible. We were supposed to marry as per Buddhist traditions. It was I who gave him a new name — ‘Sahil'. There is no wrongdoing in all of this. ""Akanksha cited a property dispute with her uncle and said the issue was being raised to settle scores. ""Ever since my father's death three years ago, he has been eyeing our property. He knew that I was in a relationship with Sahil for the past six years. His concerns for me are fake and full of vested interest,"" she added.Her mother, Lata Rani, emphasised that ""they are Buddhists and not Hindus, and whatever we are doing is within the framework of the Indian Constitution."" She added: ""I fully stand by my daughter and Shahvez. They will get married, come what may. And if need be, we will approach the high court.""Meanwhile, Sachin Sirohi, president of Hindu Suraksha Sangathan, said the group would oppose the wedding. ""If they attempt to solemnise the marriage elsewhere, we will reach there too,"" Sirohi added.Neither Shahvez Rana nor his family were available to comment on the matter.","Meerut police register an FIR against the groom under the UP unlawful religious conversion law.

AGRA: A 25-year-old man from Delhi, his mother and stepfather were arrested in the national capital early Tuesday for allegedly strangling the man's live-in partner to death, smashing her face and then dumping the body on the Yamuna Expressway in Agra to ""destroy her identity"".According to police, the body of the 25-year-old woman was found wrapped in a blanket in a cemented drain on the e-way under the jurisdiction of Agra's Khandauli thana on Feb 6. Cops said her disfigured face was reconstructed with the assistance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the information passed on through various platforms and media, which eventually helped them get to the culprits.""The victim was identified by her sister on Monday through a media report,"" SHO Khandauli, Kuldeep Singh, told TOI. Based on the sister's complaint, an FIR was registered at Khandauli under sections 103 (1) (murder), 238 (destroying evidence) and 61 (2) (criminal conspiracy) of the BNS.During the investigation, cops found that the woman was a permanent resident of Mahoba district in UP and knew the main accused, Sunny Kumar, since 2021.

Details accessed by TOI further indicated that Sunny had cases registered against him in Jhansi under Arms Act, Gangster Act, and ‘attempt to murder'.The woman also came to know about Sunny's relationships with other women, which led to frequent arguments, Agra ADCP Aditya said. After one such argument on Feb 4, Sunny, in a fit of rage, strangled her with a rope. When his mother and stepfather came to know about it, they helped him to dispose of the body.According to cops, they wrapped the body in a blanket, sealed it with black tape from all sides, packed it, went to a friend, took his car, and on the night of Feb 4, placed the body in the vehicle and drove to a deserted stretch where they dumped it before returning to Delhi.","A 25-year-old man from Delhi, his mother and stepfather were arrested in the national capital early Tuesday for allegedly strangling the man's live-in partner to death.

AGRA: A couple and their three children -- aged 2, 4 and 5 years -- were found dead in their house in Mathura district on Tuesday morning, with prima facie reports suggesting they died by suicide. Police said a note was scribbled on the room's wall and they also recovered a 48-second video from the man's mobile.ADG (Agra zone) Anupam Kulshrestha said, ""It seemed to be a case of mass suicide. Manish Kumar, 35, a local farmer, made the video, wrote on the wall and in a diary stated that he took the extreme step on his own and no one should be held responsible for their act. All angles, including occult practice, are being probed.""The incident took place in the district's Khapparpur village, said SSP Shlok Kumar. He added that the deaths came to light when Manish's elder brother, Sudhir, who lives nearby, didn't notice anyone coming out from the house in the morning. He then scaled the outer wall and found the bodies inside the room.A police team arrived and sent the bodies for postmortem. Those found dead included Manish; wife Seema, 32; daughters Hunny, 5, and Priyanshi, 4; and son Pankaj, 2.Preliminary probe indicated that Manish had first strangled the children with a rope, then fatally struck his wife with a heavy object, and killed himself by electrocution. ""The clip is believed to have been recorded between 4am and 5am,"" police said, adding that the mass suicide act purportedly spanned for about two hours.According to police, the note in Hindi stated, ""I, Manish and Seema are committing suicide of my own will. Police should not bother anyone."" In the purported video, Manish can be heard making a similar statement, possibly minutes before killing himself.His neighbour said that Manish, who was married about eight years ago, used to work on around three bighas of ancestral land in Mathura district and did not have any pending loans. His daughters were enrolled in the village school. His two brothers stay separately in the same village.Elder brother Sudhir said, ""I'm unaware of any family stress.

KENDRAPADA: In a stark reminder of prevailing caste prejudice in rural Odisha, parents have stopped sending their children to an anganwadi centre after an educated dalit girl was appointed as helper-cum-cook, forcing the centre to remain shut for nearly three months.Authorities had appointed Sarmista Sethi (23), a graduate, as an anganwadi helper at the Nuagaon centre under Ghadiamala gram panchayat in Rajnagar block about four months back. Soon after, the village committee, consisting mostly members from the upper caste, decided not to send children to the centre in protest against her appointment. Officials are yet to break the deadlock, leaving the fate of around 60 children hanging in balance.Around 45 families, including seven dalit families, live in this riverside village. Sarmista faced open resistance from parents who told anganwadi worker Lizarani Pandav, an upper-caste woman, that their children would not have food prepared by a dalit woman. The village committee head also reportedly instructed families — including the dalit households— not to send their children to the centre.“I was posted on Nov 24, 2025. Some upper-caste villagers warned me not to cook for the kids.When I refused to obey, they stopped sending their children to the centre. Even the women have stopped coming,” said Sarmista.Sailendra Mishra, sarpanch of Ghadiamala panchayat said they had urged the village head and others to send the children to the centre. “But they didn’t listen. Pregnant women have also been avoiding the centre and losing out on crucial health benefits,” the sarpanch said.Lizarani said she has informed the chief development project officer (CDPO) of Rajnagar block, who assured her that action would be taken against those preventing children and pregnant women from visiting the centre.CDPO Dipali Mishra said many upper-caste parents opposed the idea of their children eating food cooked by a dalit woman. “We have been trying to convince them. Me, along with the Rajnagar tehsildar, held discussions with villagers on Tuesday, but the issue remains unresolved,” she said.Ramakanta Das, a villager, said many parents did not want their children to consume food prepared by the dalit woman. “So they decided not to send them to the centre,” Ramakanta said.On Tuesday, a team of dalit leaders visited the village and alleged administrative inaction against those who illegally prevented children and women from attending the anganwadi centre. “The Supreme Court, in its interim order dated April 20, 2004, in PUCL vs Government of India, had clearly stated that SC/ST candidates should be given priority as cooks in midday meals,” said Nagen Jena, district president of Dalit Samaj.Kendrapada district collector Raghuram R Iyer said after learning about the incident, he directed the district social welfare officer to submit a detailed report. “Action will be taken against those who barred children and others from attending the centre on the pretext of a dalit girl’s appointment. We are also trying to resolve the matter amicably,” the collector said.","Authorities had appointed Sarmista Sethi (23), a graduate, as an anganwadi helper at the Nuagaon centre under Ghadiamala gram panchayat in Rajnagar block about four months back.

89 victims across 9 countries including India: Who is Jacques Leveugle? 79-year-old accused of abusing minors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/89-victims-across-9-countries-including-india-who-is-jacques-leveugle-79-year-old-accused-of-abusing-minors/articleshow/128183746.cms,"



French prosecutors on Tuesday appealed for witnesses after a former teacher was charged with the aggravated rape and sexual assault of 89 minors over more than five decades across multiple countries, in what authorities described as an unusually extensive abuse case.Prosecutor Etienne Manteaux said the suspect, Jacques Leveugle, a 79-year-old former educator born in 1946 in the Alpine town of Annecy, was placed under formal investigation in 2024 and has been held in custody since then. In a rare move under French law, prosecutors publicly named the suspect to encourage additional victims to come forward.“This name must be known because the aim is to enable potential victims to come forward,” Manteaux told reporters in the southeastern city of Grenoble.Investigators say Leveugle abused boys aged 13 to 17 between 1967 and 2022 while working as a freelance teacher and instructor in several countries, including Germany, Switzerland, Morocco, Algeria, Niger, the Philippines, India, Colombia and the French overseas territory of New Caledonia. His roles included teaching French and instructing speleology, the study of caves.Manteaux said the suspect referred to himself as a “gentleman boy-lover” and targeted teenage boys, whom he described as “ephebes,” an ancient Greek term for adolescent males.Describing his conduct, the prosecutor said Leveugle was “cultured and charismatic” and would “intellectually seduce” his victims.“There was never any violence,” said Serge Procedes, commander of the Grenoble investigation unit. “We are really talking about moral coercion.”The investigation began in 2022 after Leveugle’s nephew handed over USB drives containing writings compiled by the suspect. Prosecutors said the digital material consisted of 15 volumes detailing alleged sexual relations with minors and enabled authorities to identify 89 victims so far.Investigators said around 150 people have been interviewed, though only two victims have chosen to bring civil action. Many potential victims are mentioned only by first names or nicknames, complicating efforts to locate them decades later.The probe is described as a race against time due to the suspect’s age and the statute of limitations. “This judicial investigation will have to be closed in 2026,” Procedes said.Prosecutors also said Leveugle confessed during questioning to killing two family members decades ago. He admitted suffocating his terminally ill mother with a pillow in the 1970s and later suffocating his 92-year-old aunt in the 1990s.In his writings, the suspect said he had “killed two people,” Manteaux said, adding that a parallel investigation has been opened into those confessions.Authorities urged anyone who believes they may have been a victim or who has information to contact investigators.","Jacques Leveugle, 79, is charged with aggravated rape and sexual assault.

The FBI released surveillance photos of an armed person in a ski mask tampering with Nancy Guthrie’s home security camera on the morning she disappeared, FBI director Kash Patel said.The black and white photos were “recovered from residual data located in backend systems,” Patel wrote, with four photos showing the suspect.Security camera footage of a person wearing a ski mask, holding what appears to be a plant in front of a camera.“Working with our partners – as of this morning, law enforcement has uncovered these previously inaccessible new images showing an armed individual appearing to have tampered with the camera at Nancy Guthrie’s front door the morning of her disappearance,” he added.The release Tuesday was the first time law enforcement released anything linked to a possible subject since the 84-year-old vanished 10 days ago, and the first indication that police were focusing on any suspects after what was described as a gruelingly fruitless investigation, New York Post reported.Nancy was last seen on January 31 after her son-in-law dropped her at home. She was reported missing the next day when she did not show up at a friend’s house to stream Sunday church together.The search was declared a criminal investigation on February 2, after a supposed ransom note demanding $6 million in bitcoin arrived at news outlets soon after.The note provided no proof of life, and a final deadline for ransom, which said Nancy would be in danger if it was not paid, came and went on Monday with no apparent event.Police admitted they had no suspects and no leads, as Nancy was described as being in dire need of daily medication for health troubles.","The FBI released surveillance photos of an armed person in a ski mask tampering with Nancy Guthrie’s home security camera on the morning she disappeared.

"British woman shot dead by father after argument about Donald Trump, says ex-boyfriend: 'I remember running...'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/british-woman-shot-dead-by-father-after-argument-about-donald-trump-says-ex-boyfriend-i-remember-running-/articleshow/128174624.cms,"



A British woman was shot dead by her father at his home in Texas following an argument about Donald Trump and US politics, an inquest in the UK has heard.A UK court examined the death of 23-year-old Lucy Harrison, who was visiting her father in the United States with her boyfriend at the time of the shooting.Lucy Harrison had travelled to Texas from Warrington, Cheshire, with her partner, Sam Littler, to stay with her father, Kris Harrison, and his family at their home in Prosper, near Dallas.The shooting took place on January 10, 2025, only hours before the couple were due to return to the UK.Giving evidence, the boyfriend told the court that Lucy and her father often clashed, particularly over his ownership of a gun. On the morning of the incident, as the couple prepared to leave for the airport, a “big” argument broke out between father and daughter about Donald Trump, who was due to be inaugurated as US president for the second time.“Kris and Lucy ended up having quite a big argument which led to Lucy running upstairs and being upset,” Littler said.He told the court that during the dispute, Lucy asked her father how he would feel if she were sexually assaulted. According to the evidence, Harrison replied that he had two other daughters and it “would not upset him that much”.Littler said that around half an hour later, Harrison took his daughter by the hand and led her into his ground-floor bedroom.About 15 seconds later, he heard a loud bang, followed by Harrison shouting for his wife, Heather. When Littler entered the room, Lucy was lying on the floor near the bathroom doorway.Lucy died from a single gunshot wound to the chest. She worked as a fashion buyer for Boohoo and was described by her mother, Jane Coates, as a “real force of life” who cared deeply about social issues and enjoyed debate.The court heard that Harrison had previously received treatment for alcohol addiction. He did not attend the inquest, and his legal representative said the proceedings had been conducted more like a criminal investigation than a fact-finding hearing.Police in Prosper investigated the death as a possible case of manslaughter. However, a Collin County grand jury declined to indict Kris Harrison, and no criminal charges were brought in US.","Lucy Harrison, 23, was visiting her father in the United States with her boyfriend at the time of the shooting.

(With inputs from PTI)





NEW DELHI: A 25-year-old biker who died after falling into an uncovered Delhi Jal Board (DJB) pit in the Janakpuri area last week succumbed to traumatic asphyxia with suffocation, according to the post-mortem report.The report noted that the biker was found lying in a prone position inside the pit.At this stage, the manner of death appears to be accidental, the source said, adding that the exact time of death will be ascertained after further investigation.The post-mortem report also stated that the chest compression could have been caused by a heavy vehicle falling on the body. Burn injuries found on the victim’s right thigh were attributed to contact with the motorcycle’s silencer, the source added.Delhi Police have issued non-bailable warrants against two contractors in connection with the death of a 25-year-old biker who fell into an uncovered pit in Janakpuri.The warrants were issued against brothers Himanshu Gupta and Kavish Gupta, both contractors, an officer said. Police also extended the remand of Rajesh Kumar Prajapati, a subcontractor, by one day.Meanwhile, Yogesh, a labourer who was allegedly present at the site when the biker fell into the pit and failed to inform authorities in time, was remanded to judicial custody by the court.The victim, Kamal Dhyani, a private bank employee, had fallen into a nearly 15-foot-deep pit dug by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) for sewer work in the Janakpuri area in the early hours of Friday.The police had earlier said that Yogesh, despite becoming aware of the incident after being alerted by a security guard, did not inform authorities and instead called Prajapati. He also allegedly misled the victim's family when they came searching for him during the night.Prajapati was arrested for allegedly failing to alert police or emergency agencies despite knowing about the fall hours before the incident was reported. Yogesh was arrested later in Uttar Pradesh.An FIR was registered at Janakpuri Police Station under Section 105 (culpable homicide) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita against the accused and the DJB officials. Police said efforts are on to trace the contractors against whom NBWs have been issued.","A 25-year-old biker who died after falling into an uncovered Delhi Jal Board pit in the Janakpuri area last week succumbed to traumatic asphyxia with suffocation, according to the post-mortem report.

BENGALURURelatives of Karnataka-born tech professional Chandan Kumar Raja Nandakumar, who was shot dead in a daylight attack outside a Toronto shopping mall, suspect that his efforts to form a Kannada association in Toronto may have played a role in what police are treating as a “targeted” killing.While the Toronto Police Service (TPS) has not indicated any motive so far, family members said Chandan was actively involved in organising Kannada cultural activities and was in the process of bringing together members of the community under a formal association.“We spoke to him last Friday. He said he would take leave and come home this summer. We were planning for his marriage. We are completely shattered,” his father, Nandakumar, said from their native Thyamagondlu village near Nelamangala in Bengaluru Rural district.The 37-year-old computer science graduate from Sapthagiri College, Bengaluru, had moved to Canada about six years ago and was working with LTI Mindtree, a subsidiary of Larsen & Toubro. He had earlier worked with Cognizant in Bengaluru.Chandan was seated inside his SUV when unidentified assailants opened fire near the entrance of Woodbine Shopping Centre, close to Rexdale Boulevard, around 3.30 pm local time on Saturday.Police said he sustained multiple gunshot wounds and was rushed to hospital with life-threatening injuries, where he later succumbed.Visuals from the scene showed Chandan’s white vehicle riddled with bullet holes, prompting investigators to classify the shooting as a “targeted” attack. The suspects fled in another vehicle, and no arrests have been made so far. This is Toronto’s third homicide this year.TPS Inspector Errol Watson said the incident had raised public safety concerns. “I can understand how a shooting like this, especially at a mall, can cause concern for the safety of the public,” he told reporters.The killing has sent shockwaves through the Indian diaspora in Canada, particularly among Kannadigas. Friends said Chandan was deeply involved in Kannada cultural circles in Toronto, promoting films, music and community events.Family members said he had repeatedly postponed returning to India. “Had he listened to us and come back earlier, he would have been with us now,” his father said.Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara said the state government was coordinating with the ministry of external affairs to bring Chandan’s body back to India. Chikkaballapur MP K Sudhakar said he was also in touch with MEA officials to facilitate the repatriation.His uncle, Murali Krishna, said the family was unable to understand why he was targeted. “He had built a stable life abroad and was working hard. He was the only son. We don’t know why this happened,” he said.","Karnataka-born tech professional Chandan Kumar Raja Nandakumar was shot dead in a daylight attack outside a Toronto shopping mall.
