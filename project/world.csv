A schools' association said they would go ahead with exams for lower classes on that day in the interest of students.While a cab drivers' association said they won't ply Saturday, road transport corporation employees said they will take a call in a day or two. Some autorickshaw drivers said they will participate in the bandh.Vatal Nagaraj, leader of pro-Kannada organisations that have called the bandh, said the protest is against the Greater Bengaluru Governance Bill and the atmosphere created in Belagavi region by Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti, where an NWKRTC bus conductor was attacked recently for not speaking in Marathi to a passenger.However, the Kannada Rakshana Vedike faction headed by TA Narayana Gowda said it will stay away from the protest. ""We never believe in protests. Rather we believe in focusing on problems and trying to solve them or fighting for the same. Yes, we're very disappointed with the Belagavi assault and GBG Bill, but we can't really support a full-day protest as it will affecting the earnings of people.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The brutal murder of Merchant Navy officer Saurabh Rajput has sent shockwaves through Meerut, with his grieving family demanding the death penalty for his wife, Muskan Rastogi , and her alleged lover, Sahil Shukla. Saurabh’s mother, Renu Devi, accused Muskan of killing her husband, locking his body in a room, and then going on a trip as if nothing had happened.Saurabh had been missing since March 4. The horrific crime was exposed when laborers hired to move a heavy drum from the couple’s rented house struggled with its weight. When one of them questioned Muskan about its contents, she casually said it was ""house junk."" However, as they attempted to shift it, the lid accidentally opened, releasing a foul smell. Suspecting something sinister, the laborers immediately informed the police.According to Saurabh’s mother, even their young daughter might have been aware of the crime. “Neighbors told us that she (their daughter) was saying, ‘Papa has been kept in the drum.’ She might have seen something, or else why would a child say such a thing?” Renu Devi said.Police investigations revealed that Muskan and Sahil allegedly stabbed Saurabh to death, chopped up his body, and sealed the remains in a drum filled with cement to hide the crime. Muskan’s landlord had reportedly asked the couple to vacate the rented house, which is when she and Sahil attempted to shift the body.After the body was discovered, Muskan fled to her mother’s house, allegedly to inform them of what had happened. However, Saurabh’s mother claims Muskan’s family already knew about the murder. “She (Muskan) reached her mother’s house, and her mother met a lawyer before they went to court. They were trying to cover things up, but the police caught them,” Renu Devi said.Police arrested Muskan and Sahil on Tuesday and presented them before the court on Wednesday. They have been remanded to 14-day judicial custody.Meanwhile, Saurabh’s family is devastated, claiming he sacrificed everything for Muskan, only to be betrayed in the most gruesome manner. “Saurabh left his job and family for Muskan, but she took his life,” his parents said.Renu Devi recalled how Saurabh had distanced himself from his family after marrying Muskan. “I tolerated everything for the happiness of my son and daughter-in-law. Now, she has killed my son.”The grieving mother, overwhelmed with grief, demanded strict punishment. “They all (Muskan’s family) should be hanged along with that boy (Sahil),” she said.Meanwhile, Muskan’s own parents have disowned her, expressing deep remorse over her actions. “It would have been better if she was never born,” her mother, Kavita Rastogi, told reporters.Her father, Pramod Rastogi, called for the harshest punishment. “Muskan has lost the right to live. Such a person does not deserve to be alive. She fell in love with Sahil and got addicted to drugs. He destroyed her. She lost 10 kg because of drug use. But that does not justify this crime,” he said.Pramod and Kavita said that they fully support Saurabh’s family’s demand for justice. They confirmed that Muskan had been living separately from her in-laws since her marriage in 2016 due to ongoing disputes.","Merchant Navy officer Saurabh Rajput was stabbed to death.

NEW DELHI: Violence broke out in Nagpur’s Hansapuri area as unidentified individuals vandalized shops, set vehicles on fire, and hurled stones, following an earlier clash in the Mahal area that had already escalated tensions in the city, according to reports.The unrest intensified after rumours circulated about the burning of a religious book, triggering widespread stone-pelting, vandalism, and arson.Mahal and Hansapuri were the worst-affected areas, with vehicles torched and shops damaged by unidentified attackers. The violence erupted just two kilometres from the RSS headquarters, heightening security concerns.To control the situation, Nagpur Police imposed prohibitory measures under Section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita and enforced Section 144, which bans large gatherings. A curfew has been imposed in several areas. The police are reviewing CCTV footage to identify others involved.At least 10 anti-riot commandos, two senior police officers, and two firemen sustained serious injuries during the violence, while a constable remains in critical condition in the hospital.Mobs set fire to two bulldozers and 40 vehicles, including police vans, as security forces faced challenges in controlling the situation. In response, police launched a large-scale crackdown, arresting 50 rioters, while the ministry of home affairs (MHA) sought a report on the unrest.Nagpur gears up for PM Modi's expected visit amid unrestAs Nagpur deals with recent violence, the city is preparing for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's expected visit on March 30. This will be his first public appearance alongside RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat since starting his third term.Nagpur Police Commissioner Ravinder Singal assured residents that the situation is now under control and urged them not to believe in rumours. ""We have imposed Section 144, and everyone has been told not to step out unnecessarily or take the law into their own hands. Do not believe rumors. Except for this area, the entire city is peaceful,"" he said.Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis called for peace, highlighting Nagpur's history of communal harmony. ""Nagpur is a peaceful city where people share in each other's joys and sorrows. Do not believe any rumors,"" he said.Meanwhile, Congress leader Pawan Khera attacked the BJP-led state government, blaming it for failing to maintain law and order and accusing political parties of fuelling tensions.""If the VHP and Bajrang Dal organized a protest demanding the removal of Aurangzeb's tomb, did the government make no arrangements to maintain law and order?"" he questioned.From opposition bloc, Sena UBT's Sanjay Raut also reflected on the incident, saying, ""There is no reason for violence to occur in Nagpur. It is where RSS is headquartered. It is also Devendra ji's constituency. Who can have the courage to spread violence there? This is a new pattern to scare Hindus, make their own people attack them, and then incite and involve them in riots.""Security forces are conducting searches to arrest those responsible for the violence. Authorities have asked people to remain calm, avoid unnecessary travel, and not spread misinformation. The situation is being closely monitored to prevent further disturbances.The unrest also sparked a political row in the Maharashtra Assembly . State Congress chief Harshvardhan Sapkal compared CM to Mughal ruler Aurangzeb, calling him a cruel ruler. His remarks led to an uproar in the ongoing Budget session, with Mahayuti leaders demanding legal action against him.The Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal held a demonstration in Nagpur on Monday, demanding the removal of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's grave in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar. Right-wing activists gathered at the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the Mahal area, chanting slogans and burning an effigy of Aurangzeb.This controversy over Aurangzeb has also been fuelled by the newly released Vicky Kaushal-starrer film Chhava , which portrays the conflict between Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Sambhaji and Aurangzeb after Chhatrapati Shivaji's death.The issue ties into a larger historical shift, as Aurangabad was officially renamed Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar in June 2022 to honor Sambhaji Bhosale, the second Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire.","Violence broke out in Nagpur’s Hansapuri area as unidentified individuals vandalized shops, set vehicles on fire, and hurled stones.

Shashi Tharoor's diplomacy praise for PM Modi: Wiping egg off his face or leaving Congress red-faced?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shashi-tharoors-diplomacy-praise-for-pm-modi-wiping-egg-off-his-face-or-leaving-congress-red-faced/articleshow/119218350.cms,"Why should Tharoor's Modi praise worry the Congress?

Assembly elections in Kerala due next year

NEW DELHI: Is Congress MP Shashi Tharoor trying to cock a snook at the party leadership or is the Thiruvananthapuram MP trying to convey a message to party leadership? Tharoor's praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi - two times in the space of two days - has indeed left the Congress and Rahul Gandhi in an embarrassing spot with the BJP quick to take pot shots at the grand-old-party and its leadership.On Tuesday, Tharoor had said that the country has actually a prime minister who can hug both the president of Ukraine and the president in Moscow - two weeks apart and be accepted in both places. He followed this up a day later by reiterating PM Modi's stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict.Speaking on the sidelines of the Raisina Dialogue, Tharoor today said, ""PM Modi has taken a consistent position that the solution to this conflict has to come through diplomacy. In fact, you may remember his statement in Samarkand in front of President Putin, where he said this is not an era of war and that solutions have been found peacefully. We do seem to be at the beginning of a peace process of some sort.""As expected, the BJP was jubilant and quick to target the Congress leadership. ""The knives would be out in the Congress after Tharoor's remarks, which would likely leave leader of the opposition Rahul Gandhi ""red-faced"","" said BJP IT Cell chief Amit Malviya. The BJP leader later took another swipe and said: ""Prime Minister Modi needs new haters ... old ones are turning into his fans."" Another BJP leader Sambit Patra said: ""Shashi Tharoor understands diplomacy, he had been in the UN for a very long time. He has appreciated PM Modi's stand in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Other leaders of Congress should also learn from Shashi Tharoor instead of Speaking against PM Modi and the nation every time ... Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi should come forward and appreciate Shashi Tharoor's stand.""Rahul has been a vocal and perhaps one of the fiercest critics of Prime Minister Modi. The Congress has missed no opportunity to slam the policies of BJP-led NDA government. However, on the Ukraine war front, the former Congress president had in 2023 admitted that the opposition bloc understood India's relations with Russia and had then said that he would, by and large, agree with the country's position on the ongoing war in Ukraine.When asked about his changed stand on the Russia-Ukraine war issue, Tharoor justified his position and said that he has made his opinion as a ""Bharatheeyan"" and he doesn't see any politics in that. But the Congress is unlikely to buy this argument.It was in February this year that Shashi Tharoor had surprised his party with an out-of-turn praise for PM Modi's US trip and his thumbs up to entrepreneurial growth in Kerala under the LDF government. Reports then claimed that Tharoor felt sidelined in the state Congress, despite winning his Lok Sabha seat four times in a row.Tharoor's remarks evoked strong reactions from the Congress which got into damage control mode. The Congress top brass met leaders from Kerala in Delhi for a brainstorming session. At the meeting, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge laid stress on discipline and a stern warning was given to the state leaders that strong action will be taken against those making comments that go against the party's interests.Later, the Congress claimed that all was ""okay"" in Kerala unit. Rahul Gandhi posted a picture from the Kerala leaders' interaction with the media after the meeting and said on Facebook: ""They stand as one, united by the light of purpose ahead."" His post was accompanied by the hashtag, ""Team Kerala"".The fact that Tharoor's latest round of ""PM praise"" comes despite this unity exercise and party's ""stern warning"" should indeed worry the Congress.Kerala goes to polls next year. It will be a high-stakes battle for the Congress, which failed to oust the LDF government in 2021. The CPM won 62 of the 140 seats in the assembly leaving behind the Congress, which could manage only 21.The Congress in the state has a history of internal factionalism. Ahead of the elections next year, Tharoor perhaps wants a greater say in the party's affairs in the state which the state Congress leaders may be resisting. Tharoor is no pushover in politics. His remarks in praise of PM Modi may perhaps be a message to the party leadership to ensure that he gets his rightful due in the state unit. It will be interesting to see how the Congress leadership finds the right balance between the state leaders. The grand-old-party would not want let factionalism adversely impact its poll prospects in the state.","Congress MP Shashi Tharoor has praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice in the space of two days.

BATHINDA/PATIALA: Punjab Police on Wednesday detained fasting farmer activist Jagjit Singh Dallewal and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha head Sarvan Singh Pandher as well as other prominent agitators in Mohali when they were returning after attending a meeting with a central govt delegation in Chandigarh and also evicted protesting farmers from the Shambhu and Khanauri borders.The evictions began despite assurances from Punjab ministers about the AAP govt having no plans to disturb farm protesters or the two protest sites at Shambhu and Khanauri. By late Wednesday evening, the two sites had been cleared of protesters. More than 250 protesters were detained from Khanauri, some from Mohali, and 110 from Shambhu, a senior Punjab Police officer said, adding that they were shifted to a marriage hall. Wednesday's meeting was the seventh round of talks between the two sides since February 2024 and discussions centred on the main demand for a law guaranteeing MSP for crops.After Wednesday's talks, central ministers have decided to appoint a joint secretary to engage with various stakeholders to delve deeper into the contentious issue of MSP. The next round of meetings is scheduled for May 4.Joint secretary Purna Chand Kishan will be engaging with agriculture experts and farm activists. The development comes after farmers presented compelling data from reputable agencies like Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Crisil, and RBI.The data highlighted the financial implications of providing MSP. The farmers were proceeding to the Shambhu border from Chandigarh, from where Dallewal and other agitators accompanying him were to head to Khanauri. However, they were picked up right after crossing into Punjab, in Jagatpura area of Mohali. Dallewal was detained in his ambulance, and others with their vehicles after some resistance from the farmers. Pandher was picked up from his vehicle even though he tried to get away.The farmers were apprehending some kind of action given the heavy police deployment at both protest sites, but they expected it at Shambhu and Khanauri. Punjab police rounded up a few hundred farmers at the Khanauri interstate border late Wednesday evening. The turbans of several farmers were tossed during minor scuffles as they were being put into buses by authorities to clear the protest site.BKU Ekta Sidhupur leader Kulwant Singh claimed that all the belongings and tractor trailers parked on the highway were left behind as police didn’t give them time, especially to elderly farmers, to vacate. BKU Ekta Sidhupur farmer Deepu, who is close to Dallewal, said police forcibly rounded up over 150 farmers in a matter of minutes. Sangrur SSP Sartaj Singh Chahal said the operation was carried out peacefully and police did not engage in any clash with farmers. However, the farmers claimed that police used force to round them up at Khanauri.","Punjab Police detained fasting farmer activist Jagjit Singh Dallewal and Kisan Mazdoor Morcha head Sarvan Singh Pandher.

Cops were deployed across the city to collect CCTV footage and additional evidence

NAGPUR: Large parts of Nagpur remained barricaded and under curfew Wednesday as heavy security was deployed in riot-hit areas following Monday night's violence. Police have arrested 78 people, including eight members of Bajrang Dal and VHP , in connection with the unrest. Fahim Khan , 38, identified by police as the mastermind behind the riots, was taken into custody in a predawn raid at his home in a city locality. A burqa seller and son of a cycle repair shop owner, Khan had contested the 2024 Lok Sabha elections against Union minister Nitin Gadkari, securing 1,000 votes.He led a group of protesters to Ganeshpeth police station Monday to file a complaint against Bajrang Dal and VHP members for burning an effigy of Aurangzeb and a religious chadar during demonstrations demanding the removal of the Mughal emperor's tomb in Maharashtra's Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district.Shortly after leaving the station, Khan recorded a video blaming police for shielding the demonstrators and criticising the minority commission chairman. The video quickly went viral, which police claim led to rioting in Mahal, a central Nagpur neighbourhood just 2km from the RSS headquarters.The eight Bajrang Dal and VHP members surrendered at Kotwali police station before being formally arrested in connection with the case registered at Ganeshpeth. A court granted them bail, while 27 other rioters were remanded in police custody following a nine-hour hearing.Two people critically wounded in the clashes - a teenager and a 40-year-old man who were placed on ventilator support - are now out of danger and recovering in govt-run hospitals, officials said.Police teams were deployed across the city to collect CCTV footage and additional evidence while expanding their search for suspects in six registered cases. Police have accused more than 1,200 people of various violations, but efforts have been hampered by the failure of at least 1,500 surveillance cameras, including 70 in the riot-affected areas of central Nagpur.Senior officers reviewed the situation as pressure mounted from trade groups and other community organisations to lift curfew restrictions in 11 police station limits. Authorities are expected to reassess the curfew Thursday morning.Alleged mastermind Khan had organised protests over religious issues in the past and was charged with hate speech offences. A college dropout, he is a founder-member of Minorities Democratic Party (MDP), affiliated with Sunni Youth Force active in Chhattisgarh and MP since 2019.","Large parts of Nagpur remained barricaded and under curfew Wednesday.

He has been captured on CCTV camera walking out of the house with a backpack around 5.15am on Monday, sources said. Police have filed an FIR of murder during robbery and police commissioner Sanjay Arora has formed 10 teams to crack the case, which has left the locality shaken.The victims, Mohinder Singh Talwar (71) and his wife Daljeet Kaur (70) live on the second floor of a building. Their two married sons, Chanpreet Singh and Manpreet Singh, live with their families in the adjacent building. They had an apparel business.The murder was discovered by the couple's daughter-in-law who went to check on them around 10am. According to police, the bodies were found in different rooms. Singh's body was in the bedroom, while Kaur's body was discovered in the adjacent study.Preliminary investigation suggest that the couple was murdered by strangulation. A pillow had been placed over the face of one of the victims while a bloodstained rod lay next to the other and their necks had flexible pipes around them, said a relative. The couple, it was evident, put up a fight to save themselves from the attacker, said an investigator.Furthermore, the lock on the cupboard was found broken, and the room was in disarray, with scattered items and missing valuables. Gold ornaments, including those worn by the elderly woman, were taken, along with an undisclosed amount of cash. The victim's family is still in the process of determining the full extent of the stolen jewellery.According to the victim's family, a daytime caretaker had been attending to the couple's needs until two months ago, when he left for another job opportunity.At the couple's request, the former caretaker arranged for a new caretaker to take over, who started four days ago, on Thursday. This new caretaker would visit in the evenings and depart in the mornings, providing overnight care for the elderly couple.Police suspect that the murder may have taken place late on Sunday or in the early hours of Monday as the bodies had signs of decomposition.""The house appeared to have been thoroughly searched, with several valuables missing, suggesting robbery as the primary motive,"" said a senior cop.Police have launched a thorough investigation, collecting CCTV footage from surrounding areas and interviewing neighbours who might have witnessed any suspicious activity.

enforcement. The city's mosques stopped using loudspeakers for azaan, leading to a revival of an old practice.

Mohd Shoaib has taken up the traditional role of walking through the streets at 3 AM, calling people for sehri with his voice and drum.

Before modern amplification, ‘sehri jagane wale’ would wake people up for pre-dawn meals by calling out and beating drums.

Sambhal police have filed FIRs against mosque imams for exceeding permitted noise levels.

A video of Imam Mohd Haji Raees delivering azaan from the mosque rooftop went viral, igniting discussions on religious expression and state intervention.

Authorities stated that while public address systems are banned, individuals can still call for prayers using their voices.

MEERUT: When loudspeakers were pulled down from the 16th Century Mughal-era Shahi Jama Masjid in Sambhal on Feb 23 in a sweeping enforcement of noise regulations, the city's mosques fell silent. But with the azaan now reduced to a human voice carrying only as far as the air allows, an older, almost forgotten practice has returned — one that predates modern amplification and goes back to a time when waking up for sehri depended not on sirens or electronic calls, but on men who walked the streets in the dead of night, calling out to the fasting faithful and beating their drums.This year, Mohd Shoaib has taken up that role, roaming the narrow lanes of Sambhal at 3am, ensuring that no one relying on the mosque's loudspeaker sleeps past their pre-dawn meal time. ""Due to the ban on loudspeakers in mosques, the tradition has been revived since many people find it hard to wake up without the sehri siren. I'm only ensuring that people don't miss the blessed meal,"" he said, his voice cutting through the night as he repeated the familiar call: ""Sehri ka time ho gaya hai… Sehri kar lijiye (It is time for sehri… have your sehri),"" his words punctuated by the steady beat of his drum.There was a time when this was the only way people knew it was time for sehri. Before technology took over, sehri jagane wale , or sehri wakers, would walk through towns and villages, their voices carrying across the quiet streets, ensuring no one missed their meal before the long day of fasting. Over time, their voices faded, drowned out by loudspeakers. But now, with noise limits strictly enforced, the practice has made a reluctant yet inevitable return.In recent months, Sambhal police have filed FIRs against mosque imams for using loudspeakers above the permitted noise levels. But it was the removal of the loudspeakers from the Shahi Jama Masjid, where prayers had been amplified for generations, that stirred the most conversation.A video of Imam Mohd Haji Raees delivering the azan from the mosque's rooftop, where the loudspeaker once stood, quickly spread across social media, raising debates about religious expression and the limits of state intervention. However, the authorities made it clear that while public address systems have been silenced, individual voices remain untouched by law. ""Anyone can stand on a rooftop,"" said Sambhal SP Krishan Kumar Bishnoi.","Authorities removed loudspeakers from 16th-century Shahi Jama Masjid in Sambhal as part of noise regulation enforcement.

2. They’re being funded by 501c4 charities being given dark money from Democrat politicians of these districts

3. They’re organized through facebook groups since 𝕏 is monitored by pro Elon people

Donlad Trump's warning to Tesla protestors

Tesla facilities and vehicles across the US are facing protests and vandalism. The Tesla Takedown protests are said to be in response to the role of Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the cost-cutting task force Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in Donald Trump administration. Some ""Tesla Takedown"" protests have also been destructive with fires intentionally set at Tesla showrooms and charging stations in Colorado and Massachusetts last week. There has also been a spike in Cybertruck vandalism across the US, and some car owners are defacing their own Teslas in protest of Musk. Violence against Tesla dealerships will be labeled domestic terrorism and perpetrators will ""go through hell,"" the US President Donald Trump said last week in a show of support for Elon Musk.Now a man named Jackron -- who describes himself as a former Globalist, Mechanical Engineer and Researcher -- in his Twitter profile tagged Elon Musk and claimed that he infiltrated one of the protests at a Tesla dealership and got to know a few things. The things he wrote include how these Tesla protests are organised through Facebook groups. Along with the post he also shared a printed paper that he said is a copy of anti-Elon chants distributed among the protestors.Tagging Elon Musk, Jacktron wrote,Earlier Elon Musk wrote a post 'wondering' why so much hate against him considering that his companies make great products and people love them. ""My companies make great products that people love and I’ve never physically hurt anyone. So why the hate and violence against me? Because I am a deadly threat to the woke mind parasite and the humans it controls,"" he wrote.Last week, President Trump warned those engaging in arson and vandalism against Tesla. ""Let me tell you, you do it to Tesla, and you do it to any company, we're going to catch you, and ... you're going to go through hell,"" Trump said. ""They're harming a great American company,"" Trump added.In the past few days, Tesla's market capitalization has more than halved since hitting an all-time high of $1.5 trillion on December 17, erasing most of the gains the stock made after Donald Trump won the US election in November.",Tesla facilities and vehicles across the US are facing protests and vandalism.

The division bench, consisting of Justice Sanjay Agrawal and Justice Radhakishan Agrawal, delivered their judgment regarding the complainant's appeal against the acquittal.The complainant alleged sexual exploitation spanning several years under marriage promises. According to the prosecution, the accused established a relationship with her after their Facebook encounter. This led to multiple sexual encounters, purportedly under false marriage commitments, and two coerced abortions.On April 26, 2023, the complainant filed a formal report, leading to an FIR against the accused under IPC Sections 376 , 376(2)(n), 294, 506 Part-II, and 313. Subsequently, the First Additional Sessions Judge (Fast Track Court) in Bemetara acquitted the accused on July 30, 2024, due to evidential discrepancies.The trial court noted the complainant's statements lacked supporting evidence. Medical examinations showed no pregnancy history, and forensic tests revealed no assault evidence. The court also noted the complainant's voluntary continuation of the relationship, undermining the prosecution's arguments.The complainant contested the verdict in the High Court, which upheld the previous ruling, stating that acquittals should not be overturned without substantial cause. The bench, referencing Supreme Court precedents, determined that when two interpretations exist, the accused receives the benefit of doubt.""The trial court's judgment does not suffer from any perversity or illegality. In criminal jurisprudence, the presumption of innocence is strengthened when an accused has been acquitted by the trial court. There is no sufficient ground for interference in this case,"" the division bench stated in its judgment.","The Court sustained the acquittal of a 25-year-old man in a sexual assault case.

Legal battle over Riibe’s detention

Sudiksha Konanki missing case

An Iowa man who was previously named a person of interest in the disappearance of missing University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki has returned to the United States after nearly two weeks of detention in the Dominican Republic .Joshua Riibe , 22, was able to leave after securing a new passport from the US Consulate on the Caribbean island. He was accompanied by his father on the journey home, as per his lawyers, quoted by the New York Post.“The prosecutor’s office of La Altagracia informed [Riibe] of their readiness to return his passport,” said the Dominican law firm Guzman Ariza in an email to The Post. “While Joshua appreciated this decision, he chose, for privacy reasons, to apply for a new passport at the US Consulate, which was promptly issued. We are pleased to announce that Joshua and his father are currently traveling back to their home in the United States.”Riibe, a student at St Cloud State College, had been detained in the Dominican Republic since March 6, when Sudiksha Konanki vanished after the two went for an early morning swim in rough waters at the RIU Hotel & Resort in Punta Cana.Riibe told authorities that he had managed to pull Konanki to safety but lost consciousness on the beach, after which she was never seen again.Though officials identified Riibe as a person of interest, he was never formally named as a suspect in the case. However, his passport and phone were confiscated, preventing him from leaving the island.During a court hearing on Tuesday, tensions escalated as prosecutors pushed back against claims that Riibe was being unlawfully detained.Judge Edwin Delgado ruled in Riibe’s favour, granting his request to end police surveillance and allowing him to leave the resort, but he was still unable to leave the country.Finally on Wednesday, Riibe boarded a flight home to Rock Rapids, Iowa, bringing an end to his legal ordeal.Sudiksha Konanki, a 20 year old Indian-origin pre-med student from Chantilly, Virginia, went missing while on spring break with five friends at the Riu Republic Resort in Punta Cana on March 6.Konanki's father initially suspected foul play and egged on the administration to widen their search when the mysterious disappearance of the Pitt University student was seen as a case of drowning.Konanki and a group of friends were at the beach before most of them decided to return to their hotel, leaving her behind with a male companion, according to Dominican media reports.After a massive search on land, water, and air turned yield no results even after 12 days, Sudiksha’s parents, Subbarayudu and Sridevi, finally gave up hope of their daughter returning alive. They wrote a letter to the Dominican Republic authorities, asking them to declare their daughter 'dead'.","Joshua Riibe, 22, has returned to the United States after nearly two weeks of detention in the Dominican Republic.

Trump to Iran: Strike a nuclear deal ‘very soon’ or face consequences,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-to-iran-strike-a-nuclear-deal-very-soon-or-face-consequences/articleshow/119232628.cms,"Two-month deadline

Iran’s response

Rising tensions

US President Donald Trump reportedly sent a letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, urging him to agree to a new nuclear deal “very soon,” a senior administration official revealed.However, if Tehran fails to comply, Trump is prepared to consider alternative measures to prevent the country from developing nuclear weapons.“President Trump made it clear to Ayatollah Khamenei that he wanted to resolve the dispute over Iran’s nuclear program diplomatically—and very soon. If this was not possible, there would be other ways to resolve it,” US National Security Council official Brian Hughes told The New York Post.Trump has given the 85-year-old supreme leader a two-month deadline to reach an agreement on Iran’s nuclear program, Axios reported. The president had hinted at the move earlier in an interview with Fox News, revealing that he had reached out to Khamenei to propose direct negotiations.“We can’t let them have a nuclear weapon. Something is going to happen very soon. I would rather have a peace deal than the other option, but the other option will solve the problem,” Trump had said.The letter was passed through diplomatic channels, first handed to UAE President Mohammed Bin Zayed by US special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, before being transferred to Iran, Axios revealed. However, it remains unclear when exactly the two-month deadline began.Khamenei dismissed Trump’s letter as “a deception” aimed at portraying Iran as unwilling to negotiate. However, Iran’s mission to the United Nations later suggested it was open to discussions—under specific conditions.“If the objective of negotiations is to address concerns regarding any potential militarization of Iran’s nuclear program, such discussions may be considered,” the statement read.“However, if the goal is to dismantle Iran’s peaceful nuclear program to claim that what Obama failed to achieve has now been accomplished, such negotiations will never take place.”The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), brokered under former President Barack Obama, imposed temporary restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. A vocal critic of the deal, Trump withdrew the US from the agreement in 2018, reimposing heavy sanctions under a ""maximum pressure"" campaign. In response, Tehran resumed uranium enrichment beyond JCPOA limits, including restarting an advanced centrifuge facility in Natanz in 2020.The nuclear negotiations come amid rising tensions, with US officials alleging in court documents that Iran plotted to assassinate Trump during the 2024 election season. Tehran has also sought revenge for the 2020 killing of General Qasem Soleimani, who was targeted in a US airstrike ordered by Trump.Trump has warned that any attack against him would trigger explicit instructions he left his team to “obliterate” the regime if Iran kills him.Meanwhile, Trump issued fresh warnings to Iran over its alleged support for Houthi militants, who have been attacking commercial vessels in the Red Sea.“Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN. IRAN will be held responsible and suffer the consequences—and those consequences will be dire,” Trump declared on Truth Social on Monday.","US President Donald Trump reportedly sent a letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, urging him to agree to a new nuclear deal.

Ceasefire talks amid continued fighting

US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a ""constructive"" call on Wednesday, discussing potential steps toward a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia. Among the key points raised was the possibility of the US taking control of Ukrainian power plants to safeguard critical infrastructure, a move Trump suggested could ensure their security.According to a statement from secretary of state Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz, Trump told Zelenskyy that the US could be ""very helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise."" The statement described the conversation as ""fantastic."" Trump also floated the idea that ""American ownership of those plants could be the best protection for that infrastructure.""The discussion marked a notable shift in tone following last month's contentious Oval Office meeting, which resulted in Trump temporarily halting intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine. A senior Ukrainian official, speaking anonymously, described Wednesday's call as ""very good"" and even lighthearted at times, with both leaders joking around. However, the conversation also focused on how a potential ceasefire would be monitored and the technical issues that negotiators must still resolve.During the call, Zelenskyy requested additional Patriot missile defence systems, to which Trump responded that he would work with allies—particularly in Europe—to explore availability, according to Rubio and Waltz.Trump has made ending the war a key priority of his administration, citing concerns over the cost of US support, which has exceeded $180 billion since the war began. His call with Zelenskyy followed a conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin a day earlier, during which Putin agreed not to target Ukraine's energy infrastructure but refused to commit to a full 30-day ceasefire.The Kremlin has maintained that any deal must include an end to foreign military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. However, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt reaffirmed Wednesday that the US would continue providing intelligence support to Ukraine for defensive purposes.Zelenskyy, meanwhile, expressed scepticism about Putin's commitment to limiting strikes on energy facilities. Speaking at a news conference in Helsinki alongside Finnish President Alexander Stubb, he pointed to a barrage of overnight drone attacks as evidence that Russia was not upholding its pledges.""Even last night, after Putin's conversation with President Trump—when Putin said he was allegedly giving orders to stop strikes on Ukrainian energy—there were 150 drones launched overnight, including on energy facilities,"" Zelenskyy said.As negotiations continue, the question of US involvement in Ukraine's energy infrastructure and the broader feasibility of a ceasefire remain unresolved.","US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a ""constructive"" call on Wednesday.

The day after signing the order, the department of education launched an investigation into Penn's swimming program, focusing on transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, who last competed for the school in 2022.However, the White House clarified that the suspension of federal funds came from a separate review of discretionary federal money allocated to universities. The frozen funds originated from the department of defense and the department of health and human services.A spokesperson for Penn said the university had not been notified about the funding suspension.""It is important to note, however, that Penn has always followed NCAA and Ivy League policies regarding student participation on athletic teams,"" said Ron Ozio, Penn's spokesperson. ""We have been in the past, and remain today, in full compliance with the regulations that apply to not only Penn, but all of our NCAA and Ivy League peer institutions.""The education department's office for civil rights is investigating whether Penn violated Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex-based discrimination in education, by allowing Thomas to compete. Thomas, the first openly transgender athlete to win a Division I title, swam for Penn's women's team before graduating in 2022.At the time, the NCAA permitted transgender athletes to compete under guidelines set by individual sports' national governing bodies, international federations, or the International Olympic Committee. Thomas met the requirements, which allowed transgender women to compete after one year of hormone replacement therapy.Trump's executive order, however, mandates that federal agencies can withhold funding from institutions that do not follow the administration's interpretation of Title IX—defining ""sex"" strictly as the gender assigned at birth.In response to the order, the NCAA swiftly altered its policy, eliminating the sport-by-sport approach and implementing a blanket rule that restricts women's sports to athletes assigned female at birth.The University of Pennsylvania is not the only institution under scrutiny. The department of education has also launched investigations into San Jose State University's volleyball program and the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association as part of a broader effort to enforce the administration's stance on transgender participation in athletics.","The White House suspended roughly $175 million in federal funding for the University of Pennsylvania.

The White House on Wednesday accused federal judges of overstepping their authority after a series of legal setbacks for US President Donald Trump 's administration, including a ruling that blocked the deportation of Venezuelan migrants.Press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed there was a ""concerted effort by the far left"" to install judges acting as ""partisan activists"" against the Republican-led government.""Not only are they usurping the will of the president and the chief executive of our country, but they are undermining the will of the American public,"" Leavitt said during a press briefing.One of the rulings that drew particular criticism was issued by district judge James Boasberg , who over the weekend ordered the suspension of deportation flights that the administration had carried out under a rarely used wartime law. The Trump administration had invoked the centuries-old legislation to justify the mass deportation of undocumented Venezuelan migrants, particularly gang members.Leavitt blasted Boasberg as an ""activist judge"" and a ""Democrat activist"" attempting to interfere with the president’s authority.Trump himself escalated the attacks, calling for Boasberg's impeachment on Tuesday. He labelled the judge a ""Radical Left Lunatic,"" accusing him of being a ""troublemaker and agitator"" who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.The remarks drew a rare rebuke from supreme court chief justice John Roberts, who reminded Trump that ""for more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.""Despite the pushback, Trump continued his criticism on his Truth Social platform, warning that judicial interference in executive decisions posed a serious threat to the country.""If a president doesn't have the right to throw murderers and other criminals out of our country because a Radical Left Lunatic Judge wants to assume the role of President, then our country is in very big trouble and destined to fail!"" he wrote on Wednesday.The legal challenges against Trump 's administration have been mounting. A judge on Tuesday halted the shutdown of the main US aid agency, which had been ordered by Elon Musk's newly created department of government efficiency (DOGE). Another ruling blocked the administration’s ban on transgender individuals serving in the military, citing constitutional protections of equality.Musk, a key Trump ally, also condemned the judiciary, calling the recent decisions a ""judicial coup"" in a series of posts on his social media platform, X.","The White House accused federal judges of overstepping their authority after a series of legal setbacks for US President Donald Trump's administration.

Despite pressing for a wider search for their missing daughter Sudiksha Konanki who was last seen on March 6 on her Dominican Republic vacation , the Indian-origin parents of the US girl revealed Tuesday that they now want closure -- they want Konanki to be declared dead so that they can grieve and honor her memories. After making an official request to declare her dead, Konanki's parents told the New York Post that they were convinced that there was no foul play and that Konanki drowned.Subbarayudu Konanki said the authorities showed them how high the ocean waves were when she went missing. He was also explained that Joshua Riibe, the person who was last seen with Konanki was not a suspect but a person of interest. “It is with deep sadness and a heavy heart that we are coming to terms with the fact our daughter has drowned,” he said. “This is incredibly difficult for us to process.”Konanki's parents want Riibe to be released from police interrogation. Konanki's hometown Loudon County Sheriff's office also said Tuesday that they don't think Joshua was involved in the mysterious disappearance. Riibe’s lawyer filed a legal “habeas corpus” request Monday demanding that he be allowed to return to the US because he has not been charged with wrongdoing.Konanki's parents said the media attention has been too much for them, making their loss more difficult. “We still have two young children to care for and they’re at a very tender age,” Subbarayudi Konanki said. “In light of this, we respectfully request some space, time and privacy to focus on healing and helping our children recover as we try to move forward with our lives.”Joshua Riibe told police he pulled Konanki out of the high waves but did not know what happened.

'US deeply concerned about persecution of minorities in Bangladesh': Tulsi



France embassy in Dhaka called a post ""ridiculous, baseless and intellectually weak statement"" which was claiming that they support Mohammad Yunus-led Bangladesh interim government's criticism against US intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard on persecution of minorities in the country.Reacting to a post, France embassy said, ""How ridiculous, baseless and intellectually weak statement @kawsarc @mainul_haque @carmel_trish.""A former Navy official Manoj Rawat, sharing the screenshot of French embassy sharing the Yunus' statement on Gabbad's post in his post on X, claimed that they are supporting the Yunus Government 's criticism of Gabbard's statement on the genocide of Hindus in Bangladesh.He further said that it seems that the the Indo-French Strategic partnership is just a business arrangement for France to secure lucrative Defence contracts from India.""Time to call out the French mischief in the sub-continent,"" he said in a post on X.Bangladesh released a statement challenging Gabbard's observations, calling them ""misleading and damaging"" to the nation's standing.""This statement is both misleading and damaging to the image and reputation of Bangladesh, a nation whose traditional practice of Islam has been famously inclusive and peaceful, and that has made remarkable strides in its fight against extremism and terrorism,"" Bangladesh's interim government said in a statement.""Gabbard's comments are not based on any evidence or specific allegations. They paint an entire nation with a broad and unjustified brush. Bangladesh, like many countries around the world, has faced challenges with extremism, but it has continuously worked in partnership with the international community, including the US, to address these issues through law enforcement, social reforms, and other counterterrorism efforts. Bangladesh strongly condemns any efforts to link the country to any form of 'Islamist caliphate,"" the statement added.Bangladesh also urged Gabbard to base her statements on ""actual knowledge"" when discussing sensitive issues, warning that such remarks could reinforce harmful stereotypes.""Political leaders and public figures should base their statements, especially about the most sensitive issues, on actual knowledge and take care not to reinforce harmful stereotypes, to fan fears, and potentially even stoke sectarian tensions,"" the statement said.In media interviews later, Gabbard said the US was deeply concerned about the persecution of minorities in Bangladesh and the Trump administration was committed to defeat ""Islamist terrorism"" globally. She noted that PM Modi also took this threat seriously and added that the two leaders would work together to identify and defeat the threat.""The long-time unfortunate persecution, killing and abuse of religious minorities like Hindus, Buddhists, Christians and others has been a major area of concern for the US govt and President Trump and his administration,"" Gabbard told NDTV World.She spoke about the ideology of an ""Islamic Caliphate"" and how extremist elements and terror groups globally aimed for such an outcome. ""The threat of Islamist terrorists and the global effort of different terror groups are routed in the same ideology and objective - which is to rule or govern with an Islamist Caliphate,"" she said, adding, ""This obviously affects people of any other religion, other than the one that they find acceptable, and they choose to carry this out with terror and very violent ways and means.""Her remarks mark a strong indictment of Mohammad Yunus-led interim dispensation in Dhaka which had enjoyed support from the Biden administration.

"On Trump orders, thousands of JFK assassination documents newly public",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/on-trump-orders-thousands-of-jfk-assassination-documents-newly-public/articleshow/119235219.cms,"WASHINGTON: Thousands of pages of digital documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy are now available for historians, conspiracy theorists and the merely curious, following orders from US President Trump.An initial tranche of electronic copies of papers flooded into the National Archives website on Tuesday evening after justice department lawyers spent hours scouring them. As of 10.30pm, the National Archives had published 2,182 PDFs totaling 63,400 pages. Trump had said a day earlier that the release would include around 80,000 pages. The archives did not immediately respond on Wednesday to a request for comment on whether more documents would soon be released. The archives' Kennedy assassination collection has more than six million pages of records, the vast majority of which had been made public before Trump's order.The digital documents released on Tuesday offer a window into the climate of fear surrounding US relations with the Soviet Union shortly after the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Experts doubt the new release will change what is known about the killing of JFK, as Kennedy is known, in Dallas on Nov 22, 1963. The release is nonetheless likely to intrigue people.Fredrik Logevall, a Harvard history professor whose books include ""JFK: Coming of Age in the American Century 1917-56,"" said in an email the new papers may help fill in the picture, but added, ""...I don't expect dramatic new revelations that alters in some fundamental way our grasp of the event.""One document with the heading ""secret"" was a typed account with handwritten notes of a 1964 interview by a Warren Commission researcher who questioned Lee Wigren, a CIA employee, about inconsistencies in material provided to the commission by the state department and the CIA about marriages between Soviet women and American men. Oswald was married to a Soviet woman at the time of the shooting.Department of defence documents from 1963 covered the Cold War of the early 1960s and the US involvement in Latin America, trying to thwart Cuban leader Fidel Castro's support of communists in other countries. The documents suggest that Castro would not go so far as to provoke a war with the US or escalate to the point ""that would seriously and immediately endanger the Castro regime."" One document released from Jan 1962 reveals details of a top secret project called "" Operation Mongoose ,"" or simply ""the Cuban Project,"" which was a CIA-led campaign of covert operations and sabotage against Cuba, authorised by Kennedy in 1961, aimed at removing the Castro regime.Kennedy's murder has been attributed to a sole gunman, Oswald. But polls show many Americans still believe his death was a result of a conspiracy.Trump's secretary of health and human services, Robert F Kennedy Jr, a nephew of JFK, has said he believes the CIA was involved in his uncle's death, an allegation the agency has described as baseless. Kennedy Jr declined comment when contacted on Tuesday.","Thousands of pages of digital documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy are now available for historians, conspiracy theorists and the merely curious.

The order came after the administration said he was improperly intruding on presidential discretion to handle sensitive diplomatic and national security matters, the latest escalation in a confrontation between executive and judicial branches of US govt.",US judge extends deadline for govt to provide more details about flights deporting Venezuelan migrants.

Elon Musk dismantling USAID likely violated constitution: Judge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-dismantling-usaid-likely-violated-constitution-judge/articleshow/119234925.cms,"Efforts by Elon Musk and his team to permanently shutter USAID likely violated constitution ""in multiple ways"" and robbed Congress of its authority to oversee the dissolution of an agency it created, a federal judge found Tuesday.The ruling, by judge Theodore D Chuang of US district court for the district of Maryland, appeared to be the first time a judge has moved to rein in Musk and his DOGE directly. It was based on the finding Musk has acted as a US officer without having been properly appointed to that role by President Trump. Chuang said a group of unnamed aid workers who had sued to stop the demolition of USAID and its programmes was likely to succeed in the lawsuit. He agreed with their contention Musk's rapid assertion of power over executive agencies was likely in violation of constitution's appointments clause.The judge ordered the agency operations be partially restored, though the reprieve is likely to be temporary. He ordered Musk's team to reinstate email access to all USAID staff. He also ordered the team to submit a plan for staff to reoccupy an office from which they were evicted last month, and barred Musk's team from engaging in any further work ""related to the shutdown of USAID"". Given that most of the agency's work force and contracts were already terminated, it was not immediately clear what effect the judge's ruling would have.On Feb 3, secretary of state Marco Rubio said he had assumed USAID's control and had directed cuts in his own authority. The judge said Rubio could declare his intent to permanently close its headquarters within 14 days of his order, and the offices would remain shut.Chuang said it appeared Rubio had effectively surrendered control over USAID's operations to Musk. He said any skirting of its requirements could result in him holding Musk or his members in contempt.",Ruling appeared to be the first time a judge has moved to rein in Musk and his DOGE directly.

They set off to spend eight days at the space station. The trip lasted nine months instead. On Tuesday, two Nasa astronauts who had been in orbit since June, Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, splashed down in calm, azure waters off the coast of the Florida Panhandle, concluding a saga that had captivated the world for several months.It was a SpaceX capsule, the Crew Dragon, that brought them back from space Tuesday. The spacecraft detached from the space station just after 1 am Eastern time and then travelled back to Earth, slowing from more than 17,000 mph before deploying four large parachutes that gently plopped the spacecraft into the water just before 6 pm. Once the capsule had been hoisted onto a ship, the door was opened and the beaming astronauts were extracted from the spacecraft.After months of weightlessness, their bodies still adjusting to the pull of gravity, they were lifted onto gurneys.They all looked like they were feeling about normal for the landing and recovery phase, where their body is trying to re-adapt,"" Steve Stich, the manager of Nasa's commercial crew program, said.Returning with the two astronauts were Nick Hague, the commander of this mission known as Crew-9, and Alexander Gorbunov, a Russian astronaut. The four astronauts were scheduled to fly back to Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Houston, where they were to remain briefly until doctors let them go home. ""They'll join their families in the next day or so,"" Stich said. The mission both underlined the dominance of SpaceX in the growing field of private spaceflight and the comparative woes of Boeing. The astronauts' return was also tinged with politics.US President Donald Trump suggested in Jan that the Biden administration had stranded the astronauts, and Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, said this month that the Biden administration had rejected his offer to bring them home sooner. But Bill Nelson, who served as the administrator of Nasa during the Biden administration, said Nasa never heard about Musk's offer. ""On the basis that there was no contact with Nasa, there was no political consideration from Nasa's point of view,"" Nelson said. About a half-hour after the astronauts returned, the White House posted on social media, ""PROMISE MADE, PROMISE KEPT: President Trump pledged to rescue the astronauts stranded in space for nine months.""However, it has been Nasa's plan since Aug for the Crew-9 mission to return with Williams and Wilmore around this time frame. An hour after the White House post, Musk offered celebratory congratulations on X to teams at SpaceX and NASA ""for another safe astronaut return!"" He also thanked Trump ""for prioritising this mission!"" But the astronauts also disputed the notion that they were stuck in space.At the station, Williams and Wilmore had to adjust to unexpectedly long stay. From the start, they were short of clothes, because their suitcases had been left off the Starliner to make room for a replacement pump to fix the toilet. They relied on spare clothing in the space station. Nasa sent up their clothes and other personal items a couple of months later on a Northrop Grumman cargo ship.According to a summary published by Nasa, astronauts at the space station carried out a variety of tasks on the station, including maintenance work and nearly 1,000 hours of scientific research. That included a spacewalk by Williams and Wilmore to swab the outside of the space station to see if Earth microbes could survive and maybe even thrive in space. By the end of their journey, Williams and Wilmore had traveled nearly 121,347,500 miles, having orbited the Earth 4,576 times. Wilmore has spent a total of 31 hours conducting spacewalks during his career and Williams 62 hours, a record for a female astronaut.","Two Nasa astronauts who had been in orbit since June splashed down in calm, azure waters off the coast of the Florida Panhandle.

A huge repatriation drive

Growing worries about deportations

Calls for international help

Zahra Mousavi, a women's rights activist, fled from Afghanistan to neighboring Pakistan in March 2022 after months of fighting and protesting the oppressive Taliban regime She now lives in hiding and constant fear of being apprehended by the Pakistani police and deported to her home country.Mousavi actively participated in street protests against the Taliban regime after the Islamic fundamentalist group seized power in the war-ravaged country in August 2021.She advocated for women's rights by taking part in public gatherings and demonstrations, and tried to make the voices of Afghan women heard in the rest of the world.But with the Taliban slapping broad restrictions on women and girls and gradually squeezing them out of public life, Mousavi was forced to leave.In Pakistan, however, she has struggled to secure the necessary documents to stay in the country.""I could not obtain a valid Pakistani visa for myself and my family due to high costs and Pakistan's strict visa policies,"" the 29-year-old told DW.""This led to my arrest by Pakistani police on February 22. They entered my home in plain clothes, conducted an intense search, and arrested both me and my young daughter, taking us to a deportation detention camp,"" she said.""We were kept there in extremely harsh conditions for two days and one night, and we were only released after providing guarantees and due to the pressure of human rights activists.""DW spoke to several other Afghan female activists, who are also living in hiding as Islamabad looks to accelerate deportations to Afghanistan.Jamila Ahmadi, 27, said many of her fellow Afghan women had already been sent back to Afghanistan and warned that their lives, as well as hers, were in danger.""My activism, especially my efforts toward women's capacity-building before the Taliban takeover, my reporting on Taliban crimes, and my involvement with the National Directorate of Security (NDS), has placed me in significant danger,"" Ahmadi said.""If I am compelled to return to Taliban rule, it would clearly be a certain death.""Many women's rights activists only sought asylum in Pakistan when the situation became untenable in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.""In February 2021, I was attacked, resulting in a broken leg, but my determination remained unshaken,"" said Ahmadi.""Again, in September 2021, we were brutally beaten by the Taliban.""Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for decades.But over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with Afghanistan has deteriorated.Islamabad is angry with the Taliban authorities over the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions escalate, concerns about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan have increased.Islamabad is currently carrying out a huge drive to repatriate the roughly 4 million Afghans who have crossed the border in the past four decades.Pakistan already repatriated more than 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year, according to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).Legal experts and refugee rights activists have criticized the Pakistani government's deportation plans, particularly when it comes to deporting Afghan women's rights activists .""Sending activists back to Afghanistan, where they are very likely to be subjected to torture at the hands of the Taliban regime, would put them in greater risk,"" Osama Malik, a refugee lawyer in Islamabad, told DW.Ahmadi said her health had been affected by the deportation drive.""Unfortunately, for more than a month, the Pakistani police have made life difficult for refugees, including issues with visas and visa extensions. My visa expired on February 25, 2025. My personal, psychological and emotional problems are due to not having a visa and being unable to extend it,"" she said.While rights groups have accused the Pakistani authorities of harassing Afghan refugees, Islamabad has denied the allegations and stressed that the removals were part of a 2023 campaign called the ""Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan.""There ""is no specific category for activists among those being deported,"" a Pakistani official, who asked not to be named, told DW. ""The responsibility of hosting Afghan refugees should not fall solely on Pakistan, as other countries can also accommodate them,"" the official added.Qaiser Khan Afridi, spokesperson for the UNHCR in Pakistan, said the agency was worried about the deportations.""UNHCR is especially concerned for Afghans who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, single women, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians.""""In view of these mounting challenges, UNHCR urged Pakistan to continue to provide safety to Afghans at risk, irrespective of their documentation status,"" said Afridi.Maria Noori, a 34-year-old activist from Kabul facing deportation, called on the international community to intervene and save the lives of Afghan female activists living in fear in Pakistan.""Being sent back to Afghanistan would mean facing torture, imprisonment, or even death. The international community must understand that deporting human rights activists, particularly women, is a direct threat to our lives, and immediate action is needed to protect us,"" she told DW.The lawyer Malik criticized Western governments for their inaction.""It is unfortunate that none of the Western countries have stepped up to immediately allow these female activists to travel to their countries,"" he said.Noori explained that the lack of a legal status and residency documents poses a big challenge. ""Additionally, we face harsh economic conditions, unemployment, lack of access to health care and education, and security threats from extremists.",Afghan women's rights activist Zahra Mousavi fled Afghanistan to Pakistan in March 2022.

While the raid successfully led to the detention of more than two dozen individuals, including foreign nationals, it quickly descended into disorder as locals swarmed the premises to seize valuables, as reported by the local Pakistani newspaper The Nation. Laptops, monitors, keyboards, and other electronic equipment intended for investigative purposes were instead carried away by opportunistic looters.Videos circulating on social media captured scenes of individuals, young and old, forcing their way into the building and openly making off with electronic devices. A large crowd gathered outside, and despite the presence of law enforcement, the looting continued unabated. Eyewitnesses reported that FIA officials struggled to control the situation, allowing the ransacking to proceed unchecked. Amid the chaos, some foreigners linked to the scamming operation reportedly escaped.Sources within the FIA, quoted by The Nation, indicated that the agency had been aware of the call center's illegal activities for some time but delayed action while awaiting approval from senior authorities. The center was allegedly involved in defrauding individuals across multiple countries, using Pakistani employees to execute scams and extort money.The individuals detained during the raid were transferred to the FIA office for further questioning. However, the agency has remained tight-lipped about the broader investigation, declining to provide additional details despite repeated inquiries. The FIA now faces criticism for its handling of the operation and its failure to prevent the looting during what was meant to be a major crackdown on international cybercrime.","Chaos erupted in Islamabad's Sector F-11 after a raid by Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency spiraled into an unexpected spree of looting.

Authorities have yet to confirm any casualties in that attack.Pakistan's military is engaged in an ongoing operation in Kurram, an area that has witnessed years of violence between Sunni and Shia Muslim communities, as reported by Al Jazeera. Hundreds of people have been killed in fighting between armed groups, exacerbating tensions in the region.Kurram has remained isolated since last November, after authorities blocked key roads following sectarian violence. The closure has led to severe shortages of medicine and food, deepening a humanitarian crisis.In another incident, a bomb exploded outside a mosque in the northwestern city of Peshawar, killing a religious leader, local police said on Saturday.

Back-to-back attacks on mosques

Balochistan train attack

A powerful blast at a seminary-cum-mosque in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province’s Peshawar district killed a senior cleric and injured three others on Saturday, marking another attack on religious institutions in the region within 24 hours.Mufti Munir Shakir , the founder of the outlawed militant group Lashkar-i-Islam , succumbed to his injuries at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), hospital authorities confirmed. The explosion took place in Urmur Bala village, prompting a swift response from police, the Counter-Terrorism department, and bomb disposal teams, who are now investigating the scene.Mohammad Asim, an LRH spokesman, confirmed the cleric's passing, stating, “Mufti Shakir was brought to LRH in a critical condition and succumbed to his injuries.”Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister’s Advisor on Health, Ihtesham Ali, expressed his condolences, calling Shakir’s death a ""martyrdom"" and mourning the loss.Mufti Munir Shakir was a controversial figure in Khyber tribal region, known for founding Lashkar-i-Islam in 2004. However, his extremist views and conflicts with another militant leader, Haji Namdar, led to his expulsion from Bara Qambarkhel within six months.After continued internal strife, a tribal jirga forced both Shakir and Pir Saifur Rehman out of Bara in early 2005. The group later came under the leadership of Mangal Bagh, a former bus driver turned militant, who was elevated to amir in May 2005.Pakistani security forces launched their first military operation against Lashkar-i-Islam in mid-2005, demolishing the house of Haji Rabat and destroying an FM radio station the group had set up inside a mosque.The blast comes less than a day after another explosion at Maulana Abdul Aziz Mosque in South Waziristan on Friday. The attack, carried out using an improvised explosive device (IED), left Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) district chief Maulana Abdullah Nadeem and several others injured.The province has witnessed repeated attacks on mosques, particularly during Friday prayers when large gatherings make them vulnerable.Last month, a suicide blast at Darul Uloom Haqqania seminary killed six people, including JUI-S leader Maulana Hamidul Haq Haqqani, and injured 15 others.The Pakistan Army on Friday said that 18 of the 26 hostages killed in the Balochistan Liberation Army's recent ambush on a train were army and paramilitary soldiers.Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General, Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, stated during a press conference with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti that militants executed all 26 hostages before the military operation began.“The 26 hostages include 18 army and paramilitary soldiers, three other government officials and five civilians,” he confirmed.","Mufti Munir Shakir, the founder of the outlawed militant group Lashkar-i-Islam, succumbed to his injuries at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), hospital authorities confirmed.
