NEW DELHI: After two nursery students, four-year-old girls, were sexually abused by the sweeper of a reputed school in Thane district, protests erupted at Badlapur railway station on Tuesday where local trains were stopped and agitators blocked the tracks.Read more: Maharashtra Kids Sex Abuse Live Updates: CPRO Central Railway said, ""Local trains stopped at Badlapur railway station where protesters agitated against the alleged sexual assault incident with two minor girls at a school in Badlapur.""More than four hours have passed since the protesters descended on tracks but police and authorities are unable to convince protesters who refused to heed pleas for the withdrawal of the blockade.A call for Badlapur bandh has been given by several organisations to protest against the incident.Residents in Badlapur protested against the sexual abuse of two minor girls which occurred last week. Local train movement has been affected as protests are underway at Badlapur Station. Police have arrested a person in the case. The parents came to know about the incident on August 18 and filed anFIR .Two four-year-old nursery students were allegedly sexually abused by a newly hired sweeper at an English medium school in Thane district. The 24-year-old accused was arrested on Saturday, but the parents of the victims expressed their dissatisfaction with the police's handling of the case. They claimed that the FIR was registered more than 12 hours after the complaint was lodged, and only after the intervention of the District Women and Child Welfare Department.The school administration on Monday suspended the principal, class teacher , and female attendant, holding them responsible for the incident.The school administration has also come under scrutiny for allowing a male sweeper, who was hired on August 1, to accompany the young girls to the washroom. The incident came to light when one of the girls confided in her grandfather about the sexual abuse by the school staff member when he would take her and her friend to the washroom. The family then discussed the matter with the other girl's parents, who revealed that their daughter had recently become afraid to go to school.The families took the four-year-olds for a medical check-up with a private doctor, who confirmed that the girls had been sexually abused. They then approached a local MNS leader who accompanied them to the police station on Friday at 12.30 pm. However, instead of promptly recording the parents' statements and registering an FIR, the police station in-charge, Shubhada Shitole, allegedly made them wait for hours, stating that they needed to verify the claim first. Sources claimed that a police team visited the school but were informed that the CCTV cameras had not been functioning for the past few days.It was only after the District Women and Child Welfare Department intervened, police registered a case under the Pocso Act past midnight. On Saturday morning, police also got the girls’ medical examination conducted at a govt hospital as a private medical test is not valid in court.The police station incharge, Subhada Shitole, has been transferred to the special branch by Thane police for delaying the registration of the FIR when the parents of the child approached the police station.Locals said that along with citizens, rickshaw union, traders’ union, jewellers association, and now some political parties have also come forward to join the bandh. The accused, who was hired by the school on August 1, will remain in police remand until August 21.Rajya Sabha MP from UBT Sena, Priyanka Chaturvedi expressed her deep concern and condemned the incident.""Two young girls were sexually assaulted in Badlapur, Maharashtra in the school premises; the entire state is outraged and seeks justice. I once again urge the President to approve the Maharashtra Shakti Criminal Law, so that no other child or woman faces this travesty. Shame on the state government to continue to ignore the safety of women,"" she posted on X.Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray demanded a fast-track trial and speedy justice in the case of sexual abuse of two girls at a school in Thane district. Talking to reporters, Thackeray said on one hand, the Mahayuti government is running the Mukhyamantri Ladki Bahin scheme for women, but daughters of sisters are not safe.In an apparent reference to the rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata, where the Mamata Banerjee-led government has come under fire, the Sena (UBT) chief said politics was being done over crime against women by targeting certain states.The former chief minister claimed the school where the girls were allegedly sexually abused was linked to BJP leaders. ""The case should be fast-tracked, and the victims should be ensured speedy justice,"" he said.Leaders of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) parties like Congress, Nationalist Congress Party (SP) and Shiv Sena (UBT), besides Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, attacked the government on the incident in the home district of chief minister Eknath Shinde.Nationalist Congress Party (SP) working president Supriya Sule said the incident is “very shocking and serious” and the state home department must take note of the citizens’ anger.“Citizens are demanding strict action against the murderer who committed this heinous act. The anger of the citizens is very right and the home department needs to take note of their anger,” urged Sule.She called upon the Thane Police to thoroughly investigate the (accused) person and take strict action against him.“Apart from this, a case should also be registered against the management of the institution who tried to suppress this matter,” demanded Sule.Congress leader of the opposition in the assembly, Vijay Wadettiwar called up Thane Police Commissioner Ashutosh Dumbare and demanded the suspension of the woman police official who reportedly made the victim’s parents sit in the police station for nearly 12 hours before taking their complaint last week.“This case must be taken up by a fast track court to hear it in three months and the accused must be given the death sentence,” said Wadettiwar.Congress MP and Mumbai president Varsha Gaikwad said, “The incident of inhumane and cruel treatment of the girls is mind-numbing”, and the issue of women’s safety has become very serious during the Shinde government, while its silence was unbearable.“The number of crimes against women is also increasing, but the state Home Minister and the government are not at all concerned. It is not enough to simply say 'Ladaki Baheen' and sit with rakhi in hand. If the government wants to preserve the true relationship with the sisters, it also has to fulfil the responsibility of keeping them safe as a true brother,” pointed out Gaikwad.SS (UBT)’s Deputy Leader Sushma Andhare questioned why schools without CCTVs and ‘sevikas’ (women assistants) were given permission and said “Ladki Bahin can wait, we need ‘Surakshit Bahin’ (secure sister) first”.Claiming that there is a complete collapse of law and order in the state, SS (UBT)’s spokesperson Kishore Tiwari demanded the immediate sacking of deputy CM Fadnavis and forming an SIT to probe the shocking case.“The law and order does not exist due to corruption and cash deals to get desired police postings… The CM is like a rubber stamp as there's a complete collapse of law and order due to hostile corruption and cash and getting the desired posting. The BJP is responsible for the present messy situation,” said Tiwari.Demanding the resignation of both the CM and deputy CM, VBA Chief Spokesperson Siddharth Mokle said the incident is a blot on humanity but the government is only obsessed about winning the next elections at all costs.The Maharashtra government on Tuesday ordered the setting up of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the alleged sexual abuse of two girl students of a school in Badlapur. The SIT will be headed by Inspector General of Police-rank officer Aarti Singh, deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who heads the home department, stated on X.Fadnavis stated he has directed the Thane Police Commissioner to prepare a proposal to try the case in a fast-track court.Maharashtra government ordered the suspension of three police officials, including a senior inspector, for alleged dereliction of duty in the investigation of the sexual abuse of two girls at a school in Badlapur, amid widespread protests.""The orders of immediate suspension of the senior police inspector, assistant sub-inspector and head constable attached to Badlapur police station for the dereliction of duty have been issued,"" deputy chief minister and home minister Devendra Fadnavis posted on X.Fadnavis said the state government has appointed Arti Singh, an inspector general-rank Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, to conduct the inquiry.""It will be our endeavour to inquire into the incident at the earliest. We want to file the chargesheet in this case as soon as possible and place the matter before a fast-track court for hearing,"" he said.""Our police department will make complete efforts to get such a barbaric and inhuman act punished immediately,"" the deputy chief minister added.He slammed the Nationalist Congress Party's (NCP) working president, Supriya Sule, and former Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for allegedly politicising the issue.""It is unfortunate that the opposition seeks to gain political benefit out of such incidents. The opposition is devoid of any empathy. The politics of the opposition is coming to the fore,"" the senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said.He said Thackeray should behave like a statesman and not stoop too low and indulge in politics on a sensitive issue of sexual abuse.Meanwhile, Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde has directed the police to invoke the attempt to rape charge against the arrested accused. The case will be fast-tracked and a special public prosecutor will be appointed, Shinde said on Tuesday.""I have spoken to the Thane Commissioner of Police. The accused has been arrested. I have asked the case to be fast-tracked and book the accused under the charges of attempt to rape and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act,"" he said.The chief minister warned of legal action if the management of the school is found negligent or complicit, the chief minister's office (CMO) stated.During a meeting with education minister Deepak Kesarkar, Shinde proposed several measures aimed at improving school safety and preventing future abuse like the installation of complaint boxes in every school, enhancing scrutiny of school staff who frequently interact with students, including the background checks, and establishing safe reporting mechanisms for students.Shinde appealed to demonstrating parents to exercise restraint as the rail blockade was hampering the functioning of local trains.Maharashtra education minister Deepak Kesarkar said, ""We will see to it that the existing safety measures are further strengthened. We are issuing a circular today that CCTVs must be operational in each school. We will appoint a committee based on the Vishaka committee in schools as well. We will fast-track this case and give the strictest punishment to the accused. The school principal, the class teacher and 2 assistants have been suspended. The school also has been served a notice. A woman senior PI who delayed registering a case has been transferred but she should be suspended.""""This is a very sad incident. The entire machinery of the state education department has been mobilized. We have given instructions to four IAS officers from Pune and Mumbai. We are investigating why the CCTV was not functioning in the school. After the complaint was lodged, no action was taken, so the Senior PI has been transferred. We will bring this case to a Fast Track court and ensure the maximum punishment for the accused. Our entire department is present here, and the safety of students is our priority,"" he added.Meanwhile, a BJP MLA from the Murbad assembly constituency in Thane district, Kisan Kathore, alleged the protest at Badlapur railway station is politically motivated. He claimed agitators have come from neighbouring areas and not from Badlapur.""These demonstrators are not from Badlapur city; they have arrived from neighbouring areas such as Ulhasnagar. A comprehensive investigation is conducted against the school principal and staff members who allegedly attempted to suppress the incident,"" Kathore said.He alleged some individuals associated with political parties had put up banners in Badlapur rejecting the funds offered under the ""Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana"", but are now seeking justice. ""The protesters at Badlapur station are not locals. They are residents of neighbouring areas,"" he added.The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Tuesday demanded a detailed report from Maharashtra authorities on the incident of alleged sexual assault on two four-year-old girls in a school washroom in Thane district and the ""delay"" in filing an FIR in the matter. The Commission took suo motu cognisance of the case on a day thousands of protesters blocked railway tracks at Badlapur station in Thane and stormed the local school building, where the alleged incident had occurred.The accused, who was employed to clean the girls' toilets, is alleged to have victimised the children on August 12-13, 2024.The NHRC has issued notices to the chief secretary and the Director General of Police of Maharashtra, demanding a detailed report on the incident within two weeks.The Commission's directive calls for clarity on the reasons behind the reported ""12-hour delay"" in registering the First Information Report (FIR) after the parents lodged a complaint with the police.Parents of the victims have raised concerns over why a female staff member was not assigned to clean the girls' washroom, a standard practice that could have potentially prevented such an incident.The Commission has emphasised the need to investigate this aspect thoroughly.In addition to the status of the FIR, the NHRC has requested details about the health and well-being of the two victims, including whether they have received any counselling or support services from the authorities or the school management.The NHRC has also asked for information on the measures being taken or proposed to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) will dispatch a team to Thane in Maharashtra following the alleged sexual assault of a four-year-old girl in a school in the district. The apex child rights body has also questioned the delay in the registration of an FIR in the matter. The incident has sparked outrage, particularly due to a reported delay by the local police in lodging the First Information Report (FIR).NCPCR Chairperson Priyank Kanoongo took to social media to express his distress over the incident and announced that a team would be dispatched to investigate the matter.He questioned why police made the victim's parents wait for 12 hours to get an FIR lodged.""I will personally monitor the investigation, and ensure that all negligent police officers are punished,"" Kanoongo said in a post on X.A woman journalist covering the protest over the Badlapur sexual abuse incident alleged on Tuesday that a local leader of the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena made an offensive remark, saying she was acting 'as if she herself had been raped.'Waman Mhatre, former mayor of Badlapur who belongs to the party led by the Maharashtra chief minister, however, claimed that his remark was misconstrued.The woman journalist, who works for a Marathi daily, told a news channel that as she was covering the protests on the tracks, Mhatre confronted her, making 'vulgar' gestures. She was reporting on the incident in such a way 'as if she herself had been raped,' she quoted Mhatre as saying.""Such behavior was highly unacceptable and caused me agony. However, I responded by asserting that my reporting is based on facts,"" the woman added.Mhatre claimed that his comments were misconstrued. ""I was insisting that they provide factual information to the protesters. The word 'rape' was consistently used. I was asking them to get factual information, but it was misconstrued,"" he said.The Mumbai Press Club condemned Mhatre's statements and demanded that chief minister Shinde take action against him. Mhatre ""demonstrated blatant disregard for public sentiment by blaming journalists for the incident"" and asserted that the media was inciting unrest, the Press Club said in a statement.","Two four-year-old nursery students were allegedly sexually abused by a newly hired sweeper at an English medium school in Thane district.

In a dramatic scene that unfolded, Trump halted his speech to address the crowd after an attendee appeared to need immediate help.The event, which was Trump’s first outdoor rally since a shooting incident at his Pennsylvania campaign stop last month, took a tense turn when the former president noticed a commotion in the crowd.“What’s wrong?” Trump asked, his voice laced with concern, before amplifying his plea into the microphone: “A doctor, please!”As the sweltering heat bore down on the crowd—many of whom had waited for days to attend—Trump, visibly empathetic, turned his attention to the area where the attendee was being assisted. “It is very hot here,” he noted, acknowledging the challenging conditions. “Take your time, doctor, take your time, thank you!”In a show of solidarity, Trump joined the crowd in applause before stepping away from his bulletproof podium, flanked by Secret Service agents. He approached the area where the individual was receiving aid, offering a hug and words of reassurance before returning to the podium amid chants of “We love Trump.”Newsweek quoted the Secret Service saying that the incident was heat-related and that the individual received prompt care from EMTs. The spokesperson assured that the attendee was “fine” following the incident.This episode follows a recent tragic event at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where a 20-year-old gunman opened fire, resulting in one fatality and injuries to Trump and others. The shooter was killed by a counter-sniper, and the FBI is investigating the shooting as an assassination attempt.Trump’s rally in North Carolina, held at the North Carolina Aviation Museum & Hall of Fame, was a high-stakes event in a pivotal battleground state.

LA Knight’s greatest moments: WWE Top 10, Aug. 11, 2024

Tension between LA Knight and Kevin Nash began back in July 2023, when the WWE Hall of Famer referred to Knight as a rip-off of The Rock on his Kliq This podcast. In September, LA Knight fired back on an episode of SmackDown by mocking Nash's infamous slip-up during a promo on WCW Nitro. The feud didn't stop there, as Nash continued to express his discontent with Knight, even going so far as to claim that there was nothing original about Knight's wrestling persona.Given this history, it’s somewhat surprising that their recent interaction at WWE SummerSlam seemed amicable.In an interview with Mail Online, LA Knight opened up about his conversation with Kevin Nash. He recalled, ""It’s funny because he came up while I was sitting in catering, talking to a couple of guys, and he came up, and I felt this hand on my back, and he said hello and we talked for a minute."" He added “He was asking about the match, and everything was cool and hunky dory. I am a mirror in a lot of ways – I give back whatever I receive. We could talk trash, and whatever he says on the podcast or what I say here and there, it could go either way. If he had come in talking, you know, craziness or whatever, I’d have probably responded in that regard. But he was a sweetheart, and I was a sweetheart right back.”In the same conversation with Mail Online, LA Knight also discussed his match at last year’s Crown Jewel for Roman Reigns ’ Undisputed Championship. Throughout 2023, The Megastar rapidly became one of the most popular faces in SmackDown's main event scene, with fans eager to see him get a title shot. However, Knight explained how it was challenging to adjust to this momentum shift, and he sometimes had battling thoughts inside his head. LA Knight recently defended his United States Title against Santos Escobar on the latest episode of SmackDown. In a spectacular performance, LA Knight dominated the match from start to finish, proving to the WWE Universe why he is a deserving champion.","LA Knight recently defended his United States Title against Santos Escobar on the latest episode of SmackDown.

HC raps police over inability to trace stalker,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hc-raps-police-over-inability-to-trace-stalker/articleshow/112768936.cms,"Bombay high court

MUMBAI: Bombay high court lambasted the State for not being able to trace a man (23) who harassed his former girlfriend (21) by posting obscene pictures and videos of her on social media .“He is not a member of the organised crime syndicate. He is not an accused in a grave offence,” said Justices Ajay Gadkari and Neela Gokhale on Friday.The woman urged HC to direct police to arrest the accused following the July 31 FIR under Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita sections for stalking , defamation , and criminal intimidation .Her petition said she had known him since 2019. She went to Pune for further studies. As he could not meet her, he began harassing her. In Feb 2023, she ended the relationship, but he followed her and forced her to continue their affair. On July 4 after she lodged a non-cognisable complaint with the police, he created an Instagram handle and posted objectionable photographs of her taken by him. He also shared two videos. On July 7, he created a WhatsApp group, added her fellow students/seniors, and shared her obscene pictures with comments. He posted videos and comments on Facebook. Even after the FIR, he did not stop.On Friday, assistant public prosecutor V N Sagare said the police could not recover his mobile phone as he had fled. The police had been to his relatives in Gujarat and even to Bangalore where his maternal aunt lives. To the judges' queries, Sagare replied that the accused has no parents and is a plumber by profession. “You are waiting that he should first commit a grave crime then you will investigate properly. Is this your approach? In every matter you people are lethargic and casual. Tomorrow something happens, who is responsible?” Justice Gadkari asked.The judges sent for public prosecutor Hiten Venegavkar who informed that a team was constituted only to trace the accused. Justice Gokhale said even after the FIR, the accused continued to upload pictures and could have been traced from the IP address. Justice Gadkari added, “What fair investigation can we expect from the local police? These are not petitions by the accused. The victim has to approach this court.’’ Venegavkar said the police have written to Meta and the cyber police is active. He also said the posts have been removed and the accounts deleted. “A plumber can’t be traced in the state of Maharashtra?’’ asked Justice Gadkari.The woman’s advocate Gunjan Shah said she is a medical student and had missed her internal exams from August 5. The judges said the FIR mentioned the accused had threatened to follow her wherever she goes. They questioned what if something untoward happens. “What about the paper she could not attend because of fear?” Justice Gadkari asked.

His response, given during an interview that has recently resurfaced, offers a glimpse into the mindset of a man who would later take on the role he seemed reluctant to pursue.""I really don't believe I would,"" Trump responded, a sentiment that now seems ironic as he prepares to run for a second term on the Republican ticket . However, he didn't dismiss the importance of the role. ""I would like to see somebody as President who could do the job, and there are very capable people in this country,"" he added, hinting at his desire for strong leadership, even if he didn’t envision himself in that position.The interviewer pushed further, noting that most capable men were avoiding politics, fearing the demands and scrutiny that come with it. Trump agreed, expressing concern over the caliber of individuals seeking office. ""The most capable people are not necessarily running for political office , and that is a very sad commentary on the country,"" he said. He pointed out that while these individuals might excel in leading major corporations, they often shy away from the political arena.When asked why he wouldn’t consider running for office himself, Trump’s response was, ""Because I think it's a very mean life. I would love and I would dedicate my life to this country, but I see it as being a mean life,"" he said.Trump recognised the harsh realities of politics, acknowledging that strong views, especially those that might be unpopular but correct, could hinder one's chances of success. ""Somebody with no great brain but a big smile"" might stand a better chance of getting elected, he noted, highlighting what he saw as the superficial nature of the political process.Now, decades later, Trump is set to face off against Democratic candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris in a bid for a second term.","Donald Trump was asked if he would like to be the President of the United States.

However, they have not been well received in North Korea, where leader Kim Jong Un’s regime strictly controls interactions with South Koreans and other foreign competitors.Since the team's return on August 15, they have been subjected to a month-long ""cleanse"" intended to remove any influence of ""non-socialist"" culture, according to the Daily NK. This process, managed by North Korea’s Ministry of Sport, includes a three-stage ideological assessment designed to ensure the athletes align with state-approved values.North Korean athletes were reportedly instructed to avoid interacting with South Korean or other foreign athletes during the Olympics. Violations of these directives could result in penalties, although the specific nature of the potential punishments remains unclear.Historical precedents suggest severe consequences for perceived disobedience.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has directed the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to enhance its strategic capabilities to defend China’s sovereignty and developmental interests in this new directive.Xi Jinping, while commemorating the 120th anniversary of Deng Xiaoping 's birth, emphasised Deng’s legacy in building a modern China and highlighted his contributions to the Communist Party of China (CPC), the nation, and the world.Xi highlighted Deng's focus on modernising the military by saying, ""The best way to honour Deng is to continue advancing the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics that he initiated."" Deng's vision for the PLA included developing it into a strong, modernised, and well-organised force, emphasising the importance of ""fewer but better troops.""Xi Jinping, acting in his capacity as commander-in-chief of the PLA, reiterated on Thursday the importance of the military improving its ""strategic ability to defend national sovereignty , security, and development interests,"" as reported by the South China Morning Post.Miao Hua, a member of the central military commission, China’s highest military decision-making body led by Xi, remarked on this strategic shift during a PLA commemoration event. He stated, ""In the new journey, we should ... focus on strengthening capabilities to defeat strong enemies and opponents.""The sentiment was echoed in an article from the official PLA Daily, published a day before Miao Hua’s statement. Referring to Deng’s 1980s strategic judgment that ""world wars can be postponed or avoided,"" the article noted that China now faces ""great changes unseen in a century."" It stressed the need for the military to remain vigilant, asserting, ""We must ... always maintain strategic clarity on the possible risks of war, make full preparations for military struggle, effectively deter war and resolutely win the war.""The recent direction for the PLA to prepare for wars against ""strong enemies and opponents"" marks a significant departure from its previous focus on winning local wars.This shift is in response to the growing geopolitical challenges China faces, including its long-standing border dispute with India and maritime disputes in the South China Sea and East China Sea. Moreover, China’s relations with Taiwan have become increasingly strained, with Beijing asserting its claim over the island.China claims most of the South China Sea, a contention disputed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan. In his 2022 speech at the party congress, Xi had set the goal for ""victory in local wars"" and instructed the PLA to ""improve training and preparation for war in all aspects and improve the ability of the army to fight and win.""He further stated, ""We will strengthen the normal and diversified use of military forces, carry out military struggles with determination and flexibility, shape the security posture, contain crises and conflicts, and win local wars.""","China's military is shifting its focus to winning wars against "" strong enemies and opponents,"" according to a top defence official.

Kamala faces a Kennedy wrinkle on road to Kamalot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-faces-a-kennedy-wrinkle-on-road-to-kamalot/articleshow/112762598.cms,"WASHINGTON: The ardor of a rousing convention in Chicago that Democrats hoped would accelerate momentum for Kamala Harris was impeded to a degree on Friday when independent candidate Robert Kennedy Jr , scion of the famous political dynasty, suspended his campaign for the White House and threw his support behind Donald Trump .Regarded as a third party insurgent who attracted voters disgruntled with both Biden and Trump early in the race, the nearly 15 per cent support for Kennedy at his peak moment had dropped to 5 per cent and was plunging after Kamala Harris became the Democrat nominee.The jury and pollsters are still out on whether he can take his remaining supporters to Trump or whether they will filter into the Kamala bandwagon.There's not enough solid data yet but one poll shows Harris' lead against Trump dropped only marginally by 0.2 per cent (down from 3.3 to 3.1 when Kennedy was taken out of the equation). However the Trump camp believes even a marginal shift in closely-fought battleground state could win them the election.Seen as betraying his political legacy by Democrats and his own siblings, Kennedy literally walked over to the Trump camp, joining the former President at a rally in Arizona on Friday evening just hours after he bailed out of the race. Trump, who with his customary flourish had previously called him a ""radical left"" candidate, opportunistically reversed course and welcomed him, saying he was a well respected candidate who raised important issues during his campaign.Kennedy, 70, is the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the son of his brother, former attorney general and US senator Robert Kennedy, both of whom were assassinated in the 1960s. He caught the attention of voters with his anti-vaccine crusade in the covid years after years of work as an environmental activist and litigator. Almost all his siblings and cousins are aligned with the Democratic Party and some even spoke at the DNC in Chicago, endorsing Kamala Harris, earlier this week.Kennedy though had expressed various other frustrations with the Democratic Party after being thwarted in his bid for the party nomination, and gradually drifted towards Trump, even having secret conversations with him which were leaked. His campaign started falling apart after a series of bizarre statements he made, including admitting to leaving a dead bear in Central Park and claiming that a worm ate part of his brain.Shortly before walking over to the MAGA camp , he attempted to negotiate a cabinet position in a prospective Harris White House but was rebuffed. Trump on the other hand has indicated he is open to the idea.The Harris camp appears unconcerned by the development, seeing the new alliance as a sign of Trump's weakness and desperation after polls showed him sliding against Kamala after leading against Biden.","Kennedy, 70, is the nephew of President John F.

As Harris formally accepted the Democratic presidential nomination, Trump accused her of 'lying' and shared his live reactions on X through his Truth Social account.In anticipation of her address, Trump clearly expressed his intent to denounce Harris by posting on Truth Social, ""I'm getting ready to be fair but critical of Comrade Kamala Harris.My Play by Play will be on TRUTH Social, starting SOON!""As Harris began her speech, Trump wasted no time taking to social media to share his thoughts. He blasted her opening remarks, posting, ""Too many 'Thank yous,' too rapidly said, what's going on with her?""Trump went on tweeting spree on the vice president, focusing on her early remarks about her childhood and career aspirations. He urged her to address other pressing issues, writing, ""A lot of talk about childhood, we've got to get to the Border, Inflation, and Crime!""As Harris made a forceful defence of Ukraine and Nato in her speech, she attacked Trump’s past comments on the war in Ukraine.“As President, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our Nato allies,” Harris declared, highlighting her commitment to international alliances.She also said that five days before Russia invaded Ukraine, she warned President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and helped lead the US diplomatic response, rallying “more than 50 countries” to support Ukraine.In response, Trump defended his record on Nato, tweeting, ""Nato wasn’t paying their Bills, almost every Country was delinquent. When I said, 'If you don’t pay, we’re out, the United States is tired of being a sucker,' the money came rolling in by the BILLIONS, and I saved Nato!""Trump also seized the moment to criticise Harris on domestic issues, particularly immigration. As Harris also addressed about reforming America's broken immigration system in her speech at DNC.He accused her of wanting to grant citizenship to all undocumented immigrants. ""She just called to give all Illegals CITIZENSHIP, SAY GOODBYE TO THE USA! SHE IS A RADICAL MARXIST!"" Trump tweeted.Continuing his social media onslaught, Republican nominee posted, ""She talked about the Rule of Law but, as Border Czar, she allowed 20 Million people into our Country, many of them Criminals, who are MAIMING and KILLING our people!""Trump, with other top Republicans, has frequently labelled Harris a failed ""border czar"" in attacks on social media and during rally speeches, despite the fact that she never officially held this title. In March 2021, President Biden tasked Harris with addressing the ""root causes"" of migration to the US, a role distinct from direct oversight of border enforcement.Kamala Harris also highlighted Trump's past praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during her speech, asserting, “I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators.”In reaction, Trump tweeted, ""The Tyrants are laughing at her; she’s weak and ineffective. For three and a half years, she has done nothing but enable them to become STRONG, RICH, and POWERFUL!""He further criticised Harris, stating, ""There will be no future under Comrade Kamala Harris because she will lead us into Nuclear World War III! She will never earn the respect of the Tyrants of the World!""Harris on the final night of DNC said that she would “always stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself,” while also pressing for the release of hostages and a cease-fire deal.She also acknowledged the dire situation in Gaza, saying, “At the same time, what has happened in Gaza in the last 10 months is devastating, so many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing to safety over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking.”On her statement, Trump criticised Harris's statements on Israel, posting, ""SHE HATES ISRAEL - Wouldn’t even show up to Congress for Netanyahu’s session!""

In 2024, the world continues to grapple with severe conflicts, political instability, and humanitarian crises, making certain regions extremely dangerous. Countries like Yemen, Afghanistan, and Sudan remain at the forefront of global concern due to ongoing conflicts that have devastated their populations and infrastructure.To explore and understand which countries face the highest levels of danger, we turn to the Global Peace Index (GPI) compiled by the Institute for Economics and Peace.The Global Peace Index (GPI) provides a critical measure of the safety and stability of nations, highlighting those most impacted by war, violence, and unrest.This non-profit organization annually evaluates 163 countries across 23 indicators, including internal conflicts, societal safety, and levels of militarization, providing a comprehensive assessment of global peace and security. Here’s the list of the most dangerous countries in the world.With a 2024 GPI score of 3.397, Yemen continues to be one of the world's most dangerous countries. Since the onset of civil conflict in 2015, the nation has been plunged into chaos, with widespread famine, disease, and infrastructure collapse exacerbating the situation.The conflict, which started as an internal struggle, has been prolonged and intensified by the involvement of neighbouring countries, each backing different factions. This has only deepened the suffering of the Yemeni people, who face unimaginable hardships daily.Sudan remains one of the most dangerous countries globally, primarily due to ongoing conflicts in regions like Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile. In 2024, these conflicts resulted in over 3,000 deaths and displaced nearly 2 million people.The humanitarian crisis is severe, with frequent attacks on civilians by government forces, opposition groups, and militias. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), approximately 14 million people in Sudan are in dire need of humanitarian aid.South Sudan, with a GPI score of 3.324, remains one of the world's most perilous countries due to ongoing civil conflict, ethnic violence, and political instability. Since gaining independence in 2011, the country has struggled to maintain peace and stability, with its citizens facing continuous threats from internal strife and external pressures.Afghanistan, with a 2024 GPI score of 3.294, continues to be one of the most dangerous countries worldwide. Decades of conflict, compounded by the Taliban's seizure of power in 2021, have left the nation in a state of constant instability.The risks of terrorism, kidnappings, and widespread violence remain high, making Afghanistan a focal point of international concern.Ukraine has witnessed a significant decline in safety and stability, particularly since the Russian invasion began in February 2022. By 2024, the conflict has claimed over 150,000 lives, with millions more displaced both internally and externally.The destruction of cities and critical infrastructure, including homes, schools, and hospitals, has created a humanitarian crisis of immense proportions.The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continues to suffer from one of the deadliest conflicts in African history. The ongoing violence, which has spanned more than four and a half years, has resulted in more lives lost than any other conflict since World War II, according to the International Rescue Committee. The DRC remains a highly dangerous place, with widespread violence and instability threatening the lives of millions.In 2024, Russia's GPI score of 3.249 reflects the nation's increasing danger, exacerbated by the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Internally, Russia faces significant challenges, including organized crime and corruption, which undermine law and order.Additionally, environmental concerns, such as industrial accidents and pollution, pose substantial health risks to the population.Since the onset of its civil war in 2011, Syria has been one of the world's most dangerous countries. The conflict has devastated infrastructure, leaving buildings, roads, hospitals, and schools in ruins.The humanitarian situation is dire, with over 13 million Syrians in need of assistance, including 6.6 million internally displaced. Food insecurity is rampant, and the healthcare system is in disarray, with many hospitals destroyed or operating at minimal capacity.Mali has been embroiled in armed conflict since January 2012, when Tuareg rebels seized control of the northern territory, declaring the independent nation of Azawad by April of that year. The situation escalated further with a military coup in March 2012, deepening the turmoil in the region. Today, Mali remains one of the most dangerous countries, with ongoing violence and instability threatening the safety of its citizens","The Global Peace Index (GPI) provides a critical measure of the safety and stability of nations.

Post-Democratic Convention: What's next for Donald Trump in US elections?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/post-democratic-convention-whats-next-for-donald-trump-in-us-elections/articleshow/112774651.cms,"Trump’s strategy: A mixed approach

Personal vs policy focus

Reconciliation efforts

Defensive stance and abortion concerns

Election integrity

With the Democratic National Convention now behind us, the focus shifts to how former President Donald Trump will navigate the post-convention landscape. Trump's counter-convention tour has wrapped up, but his campaign 's struggle to keep pace with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is far from over.Trump's week-long tour across key battleground states highlighted the ongoing challenges he faces.The former president has been trying to define Harris, defend himself against Democratic jabs, and manage the reality of Harris pulling higher poll numbers than President Joe Biden before Biden exited the 2024 race last month.According to reports by US Today, on Friday, Trump made another push, aiming to address the abortion issue by asserting that his administration would be ""great for women and their reproductive rights."" This statement drew immediate criticism from Democrats, who pointed out Trump's role in appointing Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade. They also highlighted that many in his political base support abortion bans.While Trump held events in Nevada and Arizona, he also received an endorsement from Robert F Kennedy, Jr, who had recently suspended his own presidential campaign.As the campaign shifts gears, Trump will need to address the challenges presented by Harris' rising popularity. His campaign is expected to focus on Harris' ""radical"" record, though internal disagreements on strategy persist.In recent speeches, Trump has struggled with balancing personal attacks and policy discussions. During an event in Asheboro, North Carolina, Trump asked supporters whether he should ""get personal"" or ""talk about policy,"" with the crowd favoring a more personal approach. Despite this, Trump acknowledged the difficulty of sticking solely to policy when faced with attacks.Trump is also working to mend fences with some Republicans he has clashed with, including Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. Following a recent attack on Kemp for his refusal to support Trump’s 2020 election protests, Trump reached out to the governor via Truth Social, expressing gratitude for his support in Georgia.Throughout the Democratic convention, Trump faced strong criticism from Harris and other Democrats over various issues, including his past attempts to overturn the 2020 election results, his hush money trial conviction, and his conservative policies. Harris highlighted the seriousness of a potential Trump return to the White House, with Trump responding on social media with reactions to her speech, US Today reported.Trump also addressed concerns about abortion rights, expressing a commitment to women’s reproductive rights while defending his administration’s record. Democrats have been quick to remind voters of his previous support for anti-abortion measures.Looking ahead to the November election, concerns persist about Trump's potential reaction to a loss. Despite his statement to CBS News that he would accept a ""free and fair"" result, his past behavior raises questions about whether he might challenge the outcome, echoing his actions following the 2020 election.As the campaign continues, Trump faces the task of managing his image, addressing policy issues, and preparing for the upcoming debates, including the first Trump-Harris debate scheduled for September 10 in Philadelphia.","Trump's week-long tour across key battleground states highlighted the ongoing challenges he faces.

Don't you want the chemicals out of our food?"" he asked, noting that Trump shared these concerns.Kennedy Jr's endorsement has been met with strong opposition from his family. A statement released by his relatives described the endorsement as a ""betrayal"" and criticized the alliance with Trump as ""a sad ending to a sad story."" Jack Schlossberg, the grandson of former President John F Kennedy, took to social media, accusing RFK Jr. of being ""for sale"" and aligning with Trump for personal gain.The endorsement marks a significant shift in Kennedy Jr's political journey, which began with his candidacy for the Democratic nomination before transitioning to an independent run.

French media reported that Durov was detained after exiting his private jet, with the arrest linked to an investigation into Telegram’s alleged failure to moderate content, which authorities claim has allowed criminal activities to thrive on the platform. Elon Musk , the American tech mogul and owner of X (formerly Twitter), quickly reacted to the news on his social media platform. Musk posted a Grok message from his official X account, sarcastically captioning it, ""Check out this ad for the First Amendment. It is very convincing."" The post detailed Durov’s arrest, highlighting the ongoing investigation into Telegram’s moderation practices.Musk didn’t stop there. He followed up by resharing a post from the account OSINTdefender, adding his own caption: ""POV: It’s 2030 in Europe and you’re being executed for liking a meme."" This comment underscored Musk’s concerns about the future of free speech in Europe, hinting at a dystopian scenario where even the most innocuous online activities could lead to severe consequences.Durov, a dual citizen of France and the United Arab Emirates, is currently residing in Dubai. The 39-year-old entrepreneur, who fled Russia in 2014 after refusing to censor opposition groups on his VKontakte platform, has consistently positioned Telegram as a champion of privacy and free speech.Musk's comments have reignited the debate over the balance between free speech and content moderation, with his remarks drawing attention to what he sees as the growing threat to individual freedoms in Europe.","Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of Telegram, was arrested today at Le Bourget Airport near Paris.

If DeSantis runs against Biden in 2024, then DeSantis will easily win – he doesn’t even need to campaign”, Musk had said in a tweet back in 2022.Musk’s tweet was not a solitary critique; it came during a time when Trump had publicly accused Musk of being dishonest about his voting history.At a rally in Alaska, Trump claimed that Musk had falsely denied voting for a Republican candidate, saying, ""You know, he said the other day, 'Oh, I've never voted for a Republican.' I said, 'I didn't know that; he told me he voted for me. So he's another bulls*** artist.'""In response to Trump’s remarks, Musk took to what was then Twitter, now X, to clarify his position. “I don’t hate the man, but it’s time for Trump to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset,” Musk tweeted. He also said that Trump would be too old and that if Florida governor Ron DeSantis were to run against President Joe Biden in the 2024 election , DeSantis would win easily without much effort.The dynamics between Musk and Trump however, appear to be shifting once again.

Musk too, has extended his full support to Trump.During a campaign stop in York, Pennsylvania, Trump praised Musk’s intelligence and innovative mindset, suggesting that the Tesla CEO could potentially serve as a significant adviser or even join his cabinet.“He’s a very smart guy.
