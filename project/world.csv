"Have 1 more video, claims Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, urges governor CV Ananda Bose to quit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/have-1-more-video-claims-bengal-cm-mamata-banerjee-urges-governor-cv-ananda-bose-to-quit/articleshow/110042899.cms,"KOLKATA/HOOGHLY/HOWRAH: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee alleged on Saturday that “not everything” about governor CV Ananda Bose had surfaced yet and claimed she possessed “one more video, a pen drive”. She demanded Bose’s resignation, declaring that even sitting beside him felt sinful to her. “One more kelenkari (scandal), deed after deed, scandal after scandal.Who are you to torture Bengal’s women?” she asked Bose.The CM’s remarks came in response to a former Raj Bhavan staffer’s allegation that Bose had molested her within the premises. Kolkata police claimed on Friday that they had obtained CCTV footage from Raj Bhavan’s PWD wing, depicting the complainant leaving the premises “dishevelled and in tears” on May 2.Banerjee announced her refusal to visit Raj Bhavan again. “If you call me to the street (outside Raj Bhavan), I will meet you there. From what I hear about your deeds and scandals, it would be a sin to even sit beside you,” she said during a rally in Hooghly’s Adisaptagram.She described Bose as a person “with little shame” at her second rally in Howrah’s Jagatballavpur. “I want to say that this is not a one-off incident. Mothers and sisters, I know of several incidents (happening) over a considerable period of time. He occupies an important post and that is why it is unseemly to say everything. But women are now feeling scared to meet him. I would rather meet you on the footpath than go to your residence. Not one but many women have been abused.

Violent Protests in POK: Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on razor edge day after violent protests; police suppress demonstrators,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/protests-over-inflation-in-pok-turns-violent-police-suppress-demonstrators/articleshow/110035195.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Businesses remained closed and normal life was affected during a crippling strike in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir's capital Muzaffarabad to protest against a police crackdown, which led to a confrontation between the security forces and demonstrators, a local media report said on Saturday.The shutter-down and wheel-jam strike in the Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir's ( PoK ) Muzaffarabad on Friday, on a call by the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC), also saw police resort to teargas shelling, affecting people in homes and mosques as well, after demonstrators pelted stones, the Dawn newspaper reported.Saturday's strike was observed in various parts of PoK, including Samahni, Sehansa, Mirpur, Rawalakot, Khuiratta, Tattapani, and Hattian Bala.The JKJAAC called for the strike after several of its leaders and activists were arrested by police in overnight raids across Muzaffarabad and Mirpur divisions.The committee had previously announced plans for a long march towards Muzaffarabad on May 11.The JKJAAC is a prominent rights movement that has been protesting against the ""unjust"" taxes imposed on electricity bills. In August of the previous year, the committee had organised a similar shutter-down strike.In anticipation of the May 11 strike, the Chief Secretary of PoK, Dawood Muhammad Bareach, had written to the Secretary of the Interior Division in Islamabad on April 22, requesting six civil armed forces (CAF) platoons for security purposes.The letter stated, ""We are (now) faced with calls for shutter down and wheel-jam strikes from May 11 onwards given by the sub-nationalists and other disgruntled subversive elements. They intend to create a law and order situation by forcibly closing markets and disrupting public service delivery.""Meanwhile, it has emerged that the Chief Secretary of the PoK had written to the Secretary of the Interior Division in Islamabad, requisitioning as many as six civil armed forces (CAF) platoons for security due to the May 11 strike.Requesting the additional troops for three months, Chief Secretary Dawood Muhammad Bareach, in his letter of April 22, said: ""We are (now) faced with calls for shutter down and wheel-jam strikes from May 11 onwards given by the sub-nationalists and other disgruntled subversive elements. They intend to create a law and order situation by forcibly closing markets and disrupting public service delivery.""Sources said in anticipation of the strike, the government had enforced Section 144 across PoK and announced holidays in all educational institutions on May 10 and 11. However, people came out in thousands on the road in all districts of PoK.The JKJAAC movement has demanded that electricity should be provided to consumers following the production cost of hydro-power in the state, Dawn said.In December last year, it had reached an understanding with an official reconciliation committee, following which a notification was also issued by the government on February 4.However, in April the committee announced the long march on May 11 in protest against the ""non-fulfillment of the written commitments"" by the government.The Dawn newspaper reported that all businesses, including banks, remained closed, and traffic and vendors were off the roads in three districts of Muzaffarabad division.","Businesses remained closed and normal life was affected during a crippling strike in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir's capital Muzaffarabad.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urgently appealed for military aid as Ukrainian troops engage in counterattacks to thwart Russian advances.Moscow's defense ministry announced the ""liberation"" of five villages in Kharkiv near the Russian border, along with the seizure of one village in the Donetsk region.This offensive follows Russia's reported incursion into the Kharkiv region, marking small advancements into a border zone from which it had been repelled nearly two years ago.President Zelenskyy, in a televised address, emphasized the imperative of disrupting Russian offensive plans, labeling it as the country's top priority. Heavy fighting has been reported in the border area, prompting the evacuation of 1,775 individuals. Tragically, two men were killed and two others wounded by guided aerial bomb attacks in the town of Vovchansk.Despite assurances from Kharkiv regional governor Oleg Synegubov that there is currently no imminent ground operation threat to the city of Kharkiv, residents from border areas have fled in fear. Evacuees, many of whom are elderly, have sought refuge at reception centers near Kharkiv, receiving essential assistance.The situation remains precarious, with aid workers highlighting the challenges of evacuating residents amid ongoing troop movements and heightened danger. Zelenskyy reiterated the urgent need for international support, stressing the importance of timely arms deliveries to bolster Ukrainian defenses.Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces have intensified attacks inside Russia and Russia-held territories, targeting energy infrastructure. In a retaliatory strike, a missile hit a restaurant in the Russian-held city of Donetsk, claiming three lives and injuring several others.Analysts speculate that Russia's ground operation aims to establish a buffer zone near its Belgorod region or divert Ukrainian resources from the Donetsk region. Despite Washington's announcement of a $400 million military aid package for Ukraine and assurances of its capability to repel fresh Russian campaigns, the situation on the ground remains volatile.","Moscow's defense ministry announced the ""liberation"" of five villages in Kharkiv near the Russian border.

""We stand with the Georgian people.""The bill, which would require organisations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as ""agents of foreign influence"", has touched off a rolling political crisis in Georgia, where thousands have taken to the streets to demand the bill be withdrawn.The crowd on Saturday waved Georgian, European Union and some Ukrainian flags and in a break with the past, included more older protesters as well as the many young people who have thronged the streets over the past month.""The government should hear the free people of Georgia,"" said one protester in her 30s who gave her name as Nino, waved a large Georgian flag and led one of three columns that converged on the city centre, which blocked much of the city's roads and filled the cobblestoned heart of Tbilisi's old town.""We want to enter the European Union with our proud nation and our dignity,"" she said.Anuki, a 22-year-old student of acting, said it was her generation's responsibility ""to make sure that our future and the future of generations after us are safe, that they have freedom of speech, and they are free, basically.""""And we don't want to be part of Russia,"" she added.

Joe Biden wants to remind 2024 voters of a record and an agenda. Often it's Donald Trump's,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/joe-biden-wants-to-remind-2024-voters-of-a-record-and-an-agenda-often-its-donald-trumps/articleshow/110043097.cms,"SEATTLE: President Joe Biden is running for reelection on a record and an agenda -- often Donald Trump ’s.In a hotel ballroom in Seattle, at fancy homes in California and at stops in Illinois and Wisconsin over the past week, Biden has been betting that reminding voters about Trump's presidency and highlighting his Republican opponent's latest campaign statements will work to the Democrat's advantage.At a Seattle fundraiser Friday night, Biden brought up Trump's recent interview with Time magazine in which Trump said states should be left to determine whether to prosecute women for abortions or to monitor their pregnancies.“I really urge you to read it,” Biden said.Biden, who headlined another Seattle fundraiser Saturday before returning to the East Coast, has plenty of other Trump material to draw from, too.The president highlights how Trump has promised, if elected, to be “a dictator on Day 1”, how he has suggested the United States would not necessarily defend allies from aggression and how he has pledged to “totally obliterate the deep state” in the federal bureaucracy, which he blames for blocking his first-term agenda.“And he said a whole lot more,” Biden said during a Chicago appearance. “But the bad news is he means what he says. He means what he says. Unless you think I’m kidding, just think back to the 6th of January. This guy means what he says,” referring to the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.Biden wants the 2024 to be a referendum on Trump's record and plans, but he also wants voters to look favorably on his own policies and actions.Biden and his allies think the country needs reminding about Trump's tenure and his outlandish and often concerning statements, particularly because the Republican is no longer ubiquitous on X, formerly Twitter, nor is he in front of television cameras as often as he once was.“Chaos is nothing new for Trump,” Biden said in Chicago. “His presidency was chaos. Trump is trying to make the -- the country forget about the dark and unsettling things that he did when he was president. Well, we’re going to not let them forget.”Biden frequently highlights Trump's efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election and how he stood by when supporters violently stormed the Capitol as Congress met to certify his loss to Biden. He also points to Trump separating children from their families at the U.S.-Mexico border, tax cuts the Republican pushed through that benefited corporations and the wealthy and his repeated efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act.Biden's barbs have been getting sharper of late.He opened his Seattle fundraiser on Friday night by telling donors, “Thank you for the warm welcome. Please keep it down, because Donald Trump is sleeping. Sleepy Don.” That was a riff off of news reports that the former president has dozed off during his criminal trial in a New York courtroom. Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges in a hush money scheme to illegally influence the 2016 presidential election.Biden also talks about Trump’s admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his self-described “love letters” with Kim Jong Un, the authoritarian leader of North Korea.Biden frequently jabs at Trump for wondering aloud during the COVID-19 pandemic whether disinfectants could be injected or ingested to fight the virus. “That bleach he didn’t inject in his body; he just put it in his hair,” Biden says to laughter every time. “But, look, he’s got more hair than I do.”Trump's campaign said in a statement that “their records speak for themselves. President Trump created the most secure border in history and peace in the world. President Trump was the first president in modern history not to enter the U.S. in any new wars. Joe Biden’s weakness has led to wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, an immigrant invasion of our border, anti-Semitic protests on our college campuses, and crime and chaos in every American city.”Trump doesn't hesitate to criticize Biden and his policies. Trump is spending much of his time lately sitting in court. But before and after the proceedings, he often stands in front of cameras outside the courtroom and goes after Biden.At a recent Wisconsin rally, Trump mentioned Biden within the first 2½ minutes of his speech and referenced the president or his administration more than 60 times during his remarks.Trump's criticism often takes a dark turn. Last weekend, he told donors at his Florida resort that Biden was running a “Gestapo administration.""The Gestapo was the secret police force of the Third Reich that squelched political opposition generally and, specifically, targeted Jewish people for arrest during the Holocaust. Trump’s unfounded comparison to Nazi-era tactics is part of his effort to deny and deflect the charges against him, most notably his effort to overturn Biden’s 2020 victory.Biden's strategy is a gamble. Voters are divided in their views of both men's presidencies.An April poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that nearly half thought Trump’s presidency hurt the country on voting rights and election security, relations with foreign countries, abortion laws and climate change. But more than half of U.S. adults thought Biden’s presidency hurt the country on cost of living and immigration.For all his criticism of Trump, Biden does get around to talking about his agenda and accomplishments. He tells supporters about his work to boost the economy and to bring the country out of the pandemic. He discusses his support for abortion rights even as he highlights how Trump has taken credit for the overturning of Roe v. Wade in part because of his Supreme Court nominations.“Folks, the choice is clear,” Biden told supporters recently in the nation's capital. “Donald Trump’s vision of America is one of revenge and retribution.”“I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s chances,” he went on. “Not because I’m president, because of the state of the moment. The world needs us.”","President Joe Biden is running for reelection on a record and an agenda -- often Donald Trump ’s.

New Russian space weapon raises alarm in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-russian-space-weapon-raises-alarm-in-us/articleshow/109919862.cms,"NEW DELHI: US officials have expressed grave concerns about Russia 's development of a new nuclear anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon, which could potentially transform Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) into a perilous battleground. The discussions about this emerging threat were highlighted by Mallory Stewart, the US assistant secretary of state for arms control, and John Plumb, the assistant secretary of defense for space policy, underscoring the serious implications of such developments.The ASAT weapon in question, allegedly already tested by Russia in high radiation orbits under the guise of electronic testing, diverges from typical scientific satellite protocols. This weapon is designed to disrupt a wide array of satellite operations spanning civilian, commercial, and military sectors by detonating in LEO, which extends approximately 100 to 1200 miles above the Earth, a report in Asia Times said.While there is no immediate deployment, the indiscriminate nature of such a weapon could severely damage satellites and impair critical global services including communication, weather forecasting, and security operations. The US officials emphasized the widespread implications of deploying such technology, noting its potential to make LEO unusable for any satellite operations.The concept of using nuclear weapons in ASAT roles isn't new and harks back to Cold War anxieties. Historical precedents like the US's Project 437 during the Kennedy administration, which was later abandoned due to its potential to damage both enemy and US satellites and infrastructure indiscriminately, illustrate the complexities and risks associated with such weapons.Recent simulations, such as those conducted by Chinese military scientists, have explored the effects of a nuclear detonation at altitude on satellite functionality. These studies show that while a high-altitude nuclear explosion would not create a traditional explosive cloud due to the absence of air, it would generate a belt of high-energy particles trapped by Earth’s magnetic field, posing a significant risk to spacecraft.In response to the decisive role satellite constellations like Elon Musk’s Starlink have played in modern warfare, evidenced by their utility in the ongoing Ukraine conflict, both Russia and China have hinted at developing ASAT capabilities to counter these systems. Reports suggest that these nations view the neutralization of such satellite networks as crucial to diminishing their adversaries' operational effectiveness.US and allied commercial satellites, including those like Starlink which have been pivotal in supporting Ukraine, have been identified by Russian officials as potential targets in the event of escalating hostilities. This stance highlights the broader strategy of using space capabilities as a means of asserting dominance and the potential shift towards militarization of space, despite international treaties like the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which seeks to bar such activities.The development and potential deployment of nuclear ASAT weapons pose not only a technological or tactical challenge but also a diplomatic and strategic one, threatening the fabric of international space law and the peaceful use of outer space.",US officials have expressed grave concerns about Russia's development of a new nuclear anti-satellite weapon.

A storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.Wednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency - the weather service's highest alert level - was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.The National Weather Service had previously reported a likely tornado on the ground in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: ""We're getting overloaded right now.""Rita Thompson, Marketing & Communications director with Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients. One died, another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening.The Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport because of the weather, media outlets reported. Northeast of Nashville, a flash flood emergency was issued for Sumner and Robertson counties including the cities of Hendersonville and Gallatin. The National Weather Service said water rescues were ongoing in those areas and described the flooding from heavy thunderstorms as life-threatening.""Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,"" the weather agency alert said.In North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.More than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.Tornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.The National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas in other counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well.Crews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.In Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties - all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.Kalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.More than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.Samantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.Her parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.""I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,"" she said. ""My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.""Travis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.""There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,"" Wycoff said. ""It was just a lot of chaos.""In southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.The Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.Candice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and ""the wind just picked up all at once.""""It was definitely a scary moment. ...

Trump heading to Jersey Shore to rally 'mega crowd' in weekend break from hush money trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-heading-to-jersey-shore-to-rally-mega-crowd-in-weekend-break-from-hush-money-trial/articleshow/110044326.cms,"WILDWOOD: After a long week in court, Donald Trump is heading to the Jersey Shore . And he's being greeted by thousands of his friends.Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , drew what his team called a "" mega crowd "" of ""tens of thousands"" to a Saturday evening rally in the southern New Jersey resort town of Wildwood. It was being held 150 miles (241 kilometers) south of the New York City courthouse where he has been forced to spend most weekdays sitting silently through his felony hush money trial .The beachfront gathering, described by Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., as the largest political gathering in state history, was designed to serve as a show of force at a critical moment for Trump, who is facing dozens of felony charges in four separate criminal cases with the election less than six months away. There is a real possibility that Trump could be a convicted felon by Election Day.Hours before he was scheduled to take the stage, thousands of Trump loyalists donning ""Never Surrender"" T-shirts and red ""Make America Great Again"" hats crowded onto the sand between the boardwalk and carnival rides to greet the former Republican president.""The everyday American people are 100% behind him,"" said Doreen O'Neill, a 62-year-old nurse from Philadelphia.""They have to cheat and smear him and humiliate him in that courtroom every single day,"" O'Neill said. ""This country is going to go insane if they steal the election again.""Trump's extraordinary legal woes, which include three other unrelated criminal cases, have emerged as a central issue in the campaign.Trump has repeatedly accused the Biden administration and Democratic officials in New York of using the legal system to block his return to the White House. Prosecutors allege the former president broke the law to conceal an affair with a porn actor that would have hurt his first presidential bid.And while Trump will almost certainly seize on his legal woes Saturday, a judge's gag order - and the threat of jail - will limit Trump's ability to comment publicly on witnesses, jurors and some others connected to the New York trial, which is expected to consume much of the month. The judge in the case already has fined Trump $9,000 for violating the order and warned that jail could follow if he doesn't comply.Trump's responsibilities as a defendant have limited his ability to win over voters on the campaign trail.He spent last week's off-day from court in the general election battlegrounds of Wisconsin and Michigan. And he was campaigning with tens of thousands of voters Saturday in New Jersey, a reliably Democratic state. Parts of New Jersey have deep-red enclaves and the southern shoreline in particular draws tourists and summer homeowners from neighboring Pennsylvania, a key swing state.President Joe Biden , meanwhile, opened his weekend with a series of fundraising events on the West Coast.He avoided Trump's legal challenges - as he has done consistently - while addressing donors in Seattle. Instead, the Democratic president focused on Trump's recent interview with Time magazine in which the Republican former president said states should be left to determine whether to prosecute women for abortions or to monitor their pregnancies.Saturday's visit to the New Jersey Shore resort wasn't Trump's first.While president, Trump held a rally there in January 2020 to thank Van Drew, the New Jersey congressman who had just left the Democratic Party for the GOP as a rebuke for the former president's first impeachment.Trump drew a crowd at the time that lined the streets, filled bars and supported numerous vendors in what is usually a sleepy city in the winter. This time, the summer season is around the corner for the resort known for its wide beaches and boardwalk games and shops.Wildwood is in New Jersey's 2nd District, which Van Drew has represented for three terms and covers all or part of six counties in southern New Jersey. It went for Trump in 2016 and again in 2020 after earlier backing Barack Obama.Trump is set to return to the courtroom next week, when key prosecution witness Michael Cohen, Trump's fixer-turned-foe, is expected to take the witness stand. Last week, he was visibly angry at times as he was forced to sit through testimony from former porn actor Stormy Daniels, who described a sexual encounter with the former president in shocking detail.Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying internal Trump Organization business records. The charges stem from paperwork such as invoices and checks that were deemed legal expenses in company records. Prosecutors say those payments largely were reimbursements to Cohen, Trump's attorney, who paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet.The prosecution could rest its case by the end of the week. It's unclear if Trump himself will take the stand when the defense presents its case.Back on the Jersey Shore, 65-year-old Pat Day said she felt some urgency to see Trump in person on Saturday.""We want to see Trump before they take him out,"" said Day, who was visiting from the Florida Keys. ""I'm worried. They're going to do everything they can so he doesn't get elected again.""","Trump is facing dozens of felony charges in four separate criminal cases with the election less than six months away.

NEW DELHI: US President Joe Biden has expressed optimism about the possibility of a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict, suggesting it could occur as early as ""tomorrow"" if the militant group releases its hostages. Speaking at a fundraiser outside Seattle, hosted at the residence of a former Microsoft executive, Biden addressed the issue after avoiding the topic at three similar events the previous day.""If Hamas would release the hostages, there would be a ceasefire tomorrow,"" Biden emphasized to the audience of about 100 people.He further underscored Israel's position, saying, ""Israel said it's up to Hamas, if they wanted to do it, we could end it tomorrow. And the ceasefire would begin tomorrow.""The president's remarks follow a warning issued to Israel earlier in the week, in which he threatened to halt the supply of weaponry if Israeli forces were to attack the city of Rafah in southern Gaza . Biden expressed concern over civilian casualties resulting from the use of US-supplied munitions.""We're not gonna supply the weapons and the artillery shells that have been used,"" Biden reiterated in a televised interview with CNN.Despite repeated rounds of indirect negotiations, Hamas and Israel have yet to reach a ceasefire agreement. The conflict intensified following an attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel, resulting in the abduction of approximately 250 individuals to the Gaza Strip on October 7. Israeli officials report that 128 hostages remain in Palestinian territory, with at least 36 confirmed deceased.The violence has taken a heavy toll, with an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures estimating over 1,170 deaths, primarily civilians, resulting from the Hamas attack. In response, Israel's military campaign in Gaza has led to the deaths of at least 34,971 people, predominantly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.","US President Joe Biden has expressed optimism about the possibility of a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict.

These moves come amid a broader wave of protests that have escalated tensions on campuses nationwide.At the University of Pennsylvania, early morning operations by Philadelphia and campus police led to the dismantling of a protest camp that had been in place for over two weeks.According to university officials, 33 individuals were initially arrested, including faculty and students, with charges related to trespassing. Among the items recovered from the encampment were heavy gauge chains and bolts, which police suggested could be used as weapons.The protests, which have also spread to campuses in Europe, are part of a larger call by students for universities to sever ties with Israel and companies supporting its military efforts. This movement gains context from the ongoing conflict in Gaza, described by organizers as a genocide—a characterization that Israel vehemently denies and which the United Nations has recognized as having a “plausible risk.”In a pre-dawn operation at MIT, police encircled the protesters’ camp and, after giving a short notice, arrested ten students who chose to remain. The removal was swift, amid chants of pro-Palestinian slogans from a dispersing crowd.The scenario was even more intense at the University of Arizona, where police used tear gas against protesters the day before the school's commencement. This intervention followed incidents of property damage and assaults reported by the university, including spiked police vehicles and thrown projectiles.Responses to the protests have varied across institutions. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, protesters agreed to dismantle their camp in exchange for dialogues with university decision-makers. Conversely, at New Mexico State University and George Washington University, responses involved arrests and continued confrontations.The recent actions have sparked a debate on the balance between safety, free expression, and the academic mission of universities, especially as commencement ceremonies approach.

CIA chief emerges as the real US powerbroker in Middle East,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cia-chief-william-burns-emerges-as-the-real-us-powerbroker-in-middle-east/articleshow/110036650.cms,"One key American official is quietly keeping Washington’s lines of communication open across the Middle East as the US and Israel endure their worst falling-out in decades over the war in Gaza.Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns , a veteran diplomat and Arabic speaker, was in Cairo alongside Qatari and Egyptian mediators this week as US President Joe Biden set off a political firestorm by halting the shipment of about 3,500 bombs to Israel.The White House is increasingly concerned about massive civilian casualties if Israel launches a ground offensive on Rafah, the southern Gaza city where 1.4 million Palestinians are sheltering from the war.Biden’s priority is winning a deal to release more of the hostages Hamas took in its deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel. And it’s fallen to the US intelligence chief to balance Biden’s carrots-and-sticks approach as Washington struggles to keep the seven-month-old war from escalating further.Burns is “a man of results and I think one of the best US diplomats I have ever met,” said Amr Moussa, a former Egyptian foreign minister.His involvement, according to Moussa, is a recognition by the US that “the rage” in the Middle East provoked by the Gaza war and Washington’s support for Israel has put the US’s reputation and credibility on the line, particularly with traditional Arab allies such as Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. They believe the White House should have put more pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the conflict.Burns “has assiduously developed personal relationships with leaders across the region for decades,” said William Usher, a former senior Middle East analyst at the CIA. “We are at a critical stage. All sides have incentives to back out of a deal and in moments like this, public posturing can often backfire.”Burns played an integral role in helping craft the week-long cease-fire late last year that led to the release of dozens of prisoners on both sides. For a moment earlier this week, it almost seemed as if Burns and his counterparts had pulled it off again after Hamas, designated a terrorist group by the US and European Union, said it had accepted a Qatari and Egyptian proposal to halt hostilities.But the talks quickly stalled again as it became clear Israel would not accept Hamas’s proposal for a truce effectively to be permanent.While Burns appears to be the most prominent US official on the Middle East file at the moment, given the importance of the ceasefire-for-hostages deal that might end the violence, he’s hardly the only official in what has at times seemed like a full-court press from the Biden administration.National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, White House Middle East envoy Brett McGurk, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, and the presidential coordinator on global infrastructure Amos Hochstein — who has experience negotiating with Lebanon, where Iran-backed Hezbollah militants are based — have all made extended trips to and within the region.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who’s made seven marathon trips to the region, has helped persuade the Israelis to open border crossings for aid, coordinate humanitarian pauses in the fighting and implement procedures to ensure aid workers don’t get killed in the crossfire, according to US officials.But Blinken’s extended tours in the region and public warnings have sometimes seemed to have little impact on the most right-wing government in Israeli history. The country’s air and ground assault on Gaza has killed more than 35,000 people in the Palestinian territory, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there. Hamas fighters killed 1,200 people and abducted 250 when they rampaged through southern Israel on Oct. 7, starting the war.“Arab public opinion has no faith in Biden’s statements and sees Blinken’s shuttle diplomacy over nearly eight months as futile,” said Mohammed Tal, former editor-in-chief of Al-Dustour, one of the main newspapers in Jordan, where Burns served as ambassador between 1998 and 2001. Burns’s involvement “has actually given some hope to people in the region — he does enjoy a certain level of credibility.”The CIA director’s role as an intelligence chief allows him to keep a lower profile and deal directly with Israel’s external intelligence agency Mossad. A veteran State Department official with years of relationships in the Middle East, Burns also has a direct line to the White House. That gets him high-level access in Middle East capitals, where officials often prefer to deal with top spies.“He’s got a pretty deep Rolodex,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Friday. “He’s got relationships all over the world and those relationships are proving important here as he tries to get those hostages home.”The hostage-release assignment is only becoming more difficult as Israel insists on targeting thousands of fighters in Hamas battalions in Rafah. At the same time, Biden is ratcheting up pressure on Israel by saying he might halt even more weapons shipments. Israeli officials have reacted to Biden’s decision with fury. They argue that disrupting weapons shipments to Israel have sent the wrong message to Hamas at a time when the negotiations were at a critical stage.Burns has also proved adept at using the respect he’s garnered in the region to deliver messages to Israel designed to be both warnings and reassurances of support. He demonstrated that tact last month as Israel was weighing the severity of its response to an attack that saw Iran launch hundreds of drones and missiles, almost all of which were repelled.Burns told the George W Bush Presidential Center in Dallas that the response was Israel’s choice, though he suggested an overwhelming retaliation was unnecessary given how Israeli armed forces had already “clearly demonstrated their superiority.”“It’s a reminder of the quality of the Israeli military,” he said. “It’s a reminder of the fact that the Israelis have friends, starting with the United States.”","Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns was in Cairo alongside Qatari and Egyptian mediators this week.

Instead, Bilawal emphasized the importance of making wheat purchases mandatory.However, some insiders had previously revealed that the ruling PML-N and PPP were close to finalizing a power-sharing agreement, with Bilawal likely to return as the country's foreign minister for the second time.

The HRCP demanded economic justice and protection of civil rights and stressed the importance of upholding democratic principles and the rule of law.In its annual report, 'State of Human Rights 2023', released on Wednesday, the HRCP noted with concern that irreparable political divisions led to public acts of arson and violence on May 9, 2023, after the arrest of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan.""What followed was flagrant disregard for the Constitution as unelected forces tightened their grip on the country's democratic structures and civic spaces shrank to an all-time low,"" the report read, according to Dawn.According to the report, the state's response to the May 9 riots was to quell dissent by resurrecting military courts to try civilians, perpetrating enforced disappearances, ordering mass arrests and allegedly orchestrating public disassociation from the PTI among many senior party leaders.The report noted that the right to freedom of expression and assembly took a particular hit during the year. According to the report, the rule of law was poor, with six-year high in fatalities related to terrorist attacks and counter-terrorism operations. The report noted that the practice of extrajudicial killings continued while street crime and the incidence of mob lynchings witnessed a rise.According to the report, journalists, activists and political workers were subjected to enforced disappearances across the country, like what happened in previous years, Dawn reported. The report noted that young Baloch women held a long march from Turbat to Islamabad to protest against alleged extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances.The report said that religious minorities reported an increasing climate of fear, particularly following the attack in Jaranwala, in which scores of churches and homes were torched and looted by mobs after allegations of blasphemy against a Christian man.The report said that Afghan nationals were rounded up in police raids and sent to deportation centres. Speaking at the launch of the report, HRCP secretary-general Harris Khalique said the economic crisis in 2023 had 'pushed tens of millions of ordinary citizens to the brink of desperation.'Speaking on incidents of enforced disappearances, Harris Khalique condemned the role and performance of the Commission of Inquiry of Enforced Disappearances and termed it 'disgraceful,' Dawn reported.HRCP chairperson Asad Iqbal Butt called it critical for the state to fulfil people's rights to education, livelihood and health.

In this regard, we have registered 12 protests and the army chief has taken a clear stance that Pakistan has its reservations on hideouts of banned outfits in Afghanistan,"" said Sharif.The DG ISPR emphasized that Pakistan will take all measures to eradicate terror networks and protect its citizens.""Pakistan will leave no stone unturned to eradicate terror networks and provide protection to its citizens at all costs ... the purpose of the armed forces is to establish peace in the country ... to ensure this, we will go to every extent to suppress the terrorists and their patrons and enablers,"" said Sharif.Pakistan recently carried out counter-attacks in Afghanistan's border areas, targeting terrorist safe havens.The DG ISPR mentioned that in 2024, security forces have conducted 13,135 operations against terrorists and their facilitators, resulting in the elimination of 249 terrorists and the arrest of 396 others.Pakistani forces are carrying out more than 100 operations daily against terrorism.","Pakistan says attack on Chinese engineers' convoy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in March was planned in Afghanistan.

More than 300 dead in Afghanistan flash floods: WFP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/more-than-300-dead-in-afghanistan-flash-floods-wfp/articleshow/110042646.cms,"- State of emergency -

LAQAYI: More than 300 people were killed in flash floods that ripped through multiple Afghan provinces, the UN's World Food Programme said Saturday, as authorities declared a state of emergency and rushed to rescue the injured.Heavy rains on Friday sent roaring rivers of water and mud crashing through villages and across agricultural land in several provinces.Survivors on Saturday picked through muddy, debris-littered streets and damaged buildings, an AFP journalist saw, as authorities and non-governmental groups deployed rescue workers and aid, warning that some areas had been cut off by the flooding.Northern Baghlan province was one of the hardest hit, with more than 300 people killed there alone, and thousands of houses destroyed or damaged, according to WFP.""On current information: in Baghlan province there are 311 fatalities, 2,011 houses destroyed and 2,800 houses damaged,"" Rana Deraz, a communications officer for the United Nations agency in Afghanistan , told AFP.There were disparities between the death tolls provided by the government and humanitarian agencies.The UN's International Organization for Migration said there were 218 deaths in Baghlan.Abdul Mateen Qani, spokesman for the interior ministry, told AFP that 131 people had been killed in Baghlan, but that the government toll could rise.""Many people are still missing,"" he said.Another 20 people were reported dead in northern Takhar province and two in neighbouring Badakhshan, he added. Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said, ""Hundreds of our fellow citizens have succumbed to these calamitous floods"", in a statement posted to social media site X earlier on Saturday.""Moreover, the deluge has wrought extensive devastation upon residential properties, resulting in significant financial losses,"" he added.Rains on Friday caused heavy damage in Baghlan, Takhar and Badakhshan, as well as western Ghor and Herat provinces, officials said, in a country wracked by poverty and heavily dependent on agriculture.""My house and my whole life was swept away by the flood,"" said Jan Mohammad Din Mohammad, a resident of Baghlan provincial capital Pul-e-Khumri.His family had managed to flee to higher ground but when the weather cleared and they returned home, ""there was nothing left, all my belongings and my house had been destroyed"", he said.""I don't know where to take my family... I don't know what to do.""Emergency personnel were rushing to rescue injured and stranded people, according to the defence ministry.The ministry ordered multiple branches of the military ""to provide any kind of assistance to the victims of this incident with all available resources"".The air force said it had started evacuation operations as the weather cleared on Saturday, adding that more than 100 injured people had been transferred to hospital, without specifying from which provinces.""By announcing the state of emergency in (affected) areas, the Ministry of National Defense has started distributing food, medicine and first aid to the impacted people,"" it said.An AFP journalist saw a vehicle laden with food and water in Baghlan's Baghlan-i-Markazi district, as well as others carrying the dead to be buried.Since mid-April, flash flooding and other floods had left about 100 people dead in 10 of Afghanistan's provinces, with no region entirely spared, according to authorities.Farmland has been swamped in a country where 80 percent of the more than 40 million people depend on agriculture to survive.Afghanistan -- which had a relatively dry winter, making it more difficult for the soil to absorb rainfall -- is highly vulnerable to climate change .The nation, ravaged by four decades of war, is one of the poorest in the world and, according to scientists, one of the worst prepared to face the consequences of global warming.The UN special rapporteur for human rights in Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, said on X the floods were ""a stark reminder of Afghanistan's vulnerability to the #climatecrisis"".""Both immediate aid and long term planning by the #Taliban & international actors are needed.""Mohammed Khater, deputy head of the UN's humanitarian affairs office in Afghanistan, said the high toll was due in part to people living near waterways, and that deaths were common during the seasonal rains.""This is an everyday incident during this season, the rainy season,"" Khater told AFP.","More than 300 people killed in flash floods that ripped through Afghan provinces.
