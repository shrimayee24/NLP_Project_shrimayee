"Security tightened at Amarnath Yatra: Surveillance drones, bomb squads deployed; 50,000 CRPF personnel to secure route",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/security-tightened-at-amarnath-yatra-surveillance-drones-bomb-squads-deployed-50000-crpf-personnel-to-secure-route/articleshow/121703186.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Surveillance drones, bomb disposal squads and canine teams will be deployed along the two designated routes of the Amarnath Yatra , as part of heightened security measures that also include the highest ever deployment of CRPF personnel for the 38-day event.Nearly 50,000 CRPF personnel, in addition to the J&K police, will fan across the route of the yatra, engaging in road opening (ROP) duties to detect and defuse IEDs, besides having quick action teams stationed at vantage points. All approach roads and routes to the national highway will be blocked when the yatri convoys, escorted by CRPF troops who will be equipped with satellite phones, will pass through. All convoys will have jammers.The Amarnath yatra, which is much shorter than its 52-day edition last year, comes in the wake of the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam, which killed 25 tourists and a local, and led to retaliatory strikes on terror bases in Pakistan as part of Operation Sindoor. When the Pakistani forces hit back by trying to target civilian settlements and military assets here, the Indian armed forces responded with full force, carrying out precision strikes on several military targets in Pakistan.Like the past year, there will be radio frequency IDs for both the yatris and convoy vehicles, to help the security forces track their onward journey and return. Drones will keep an eye on any suspicious movement along the yatra routes — both through Pahalgam and Baltal — and quick action teams will swoop in to neutralise such elements before they can strike.CRPF is already providing security to the Chenab and Anji rail bridges in J&K.Joint police control rooms will be set up along the two Amarnath pilgrimage routes for enhanced coordination among the security agencies and forces, to immediately resolve issues faced by the yatris. There will be mountain rescue teams as well to aid the yatris.Another security measure on the table is to have plain-clothed security personnel as ‘marshals’ in the buses carrying the yatris.","Nearly 50,000 CRPF personnel, in addition to the J&K police, will fan across the route of the yatra.

Musk vs Trump: Did Vivek Ramaswamy 'Doge' a bullet by getting out in time?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/musk-vs-trump-did-vivek-ramaswamy-doge-a-bullet-by-getting-out-in-time/articleshow/121664165.cms,"Trump WIPES OUT Elon Musk's $15 BILLION In Just 6 Minutes; Tesla Shares Tank, MAYHEM At Wall Street

Elon Musk EXPOSES Donald Trump-Epstein Link From 1992 Video: Mar-a-Lago Tapes Go Viral





In Washington’s latest episode of Tech Titans vs MAGA Caesar, D onald Trump has turned on Elon Musk —his former bromantic partner-in-disruption, SpaceX messiah, and self-appointed guardian of Western civilisation. The trigger? Musk labelled Trump’s much-hyped One Big Beautiful Bill “a disgusting abomination” and warned that America was hurtling toward “debt slavery. ”Trump, never one to take offence lightly—or privately—responded with a MAGA-flavoured blitzkrieg. Contracts for Musk’s companies? At risk. His reputation in conservative circles? Torched. “Just another whiny billionaire,” Trump sneered, “who forgot who made him matter.”As the Trump-Musk bromance dissolves faster than a Tesla on Autopilot in Washington traffic, one man watches the fireworks from a safe, well-lit distance—sipping Perrier, adjusting his campaign blazer, and thanking his stars he got out early, having clearly absorbed Sun Tzu’s timeless wisdom: “The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.”—Vivek Ramaswamy.Also read: 'Disgusting abomination' to 'bombshell': Trump & Musk feud spirals; timeline of the public meltdown Once the philosophical darling of the new right, Ramaswamy was handed a shiny new toy in Trump’s second term—DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency.A meme-ified federal Frankenstein, DOGE was Trump’s idea of bureaucratic reform through Silicon Valley swagger. Musk was the co-head. Vivek was the “sane one.” Together, they were meant to revolutionise Washington. Or at least yell at it until it agreed to be disrupted.But like any startup built on vibes and vague mission statements, DOGE began to implode before it launched. Musk wanted to fire half of Washington via app. Trump wanted press conferences with golden eagles and fog machines. And Vivek? Vivek quietly disappeared.Officially, he left to run for Ohio governor. Unofficially, insiders suggest he saw the writing on the Twitter wall —that DOGE was less a reform movement and more a digital kamikaze mission, powered by ego, caffeine, and libertarian hallucinations.And now, in hindsight, his exit looks less like a career pivot and more like a Sun Tzu manoeuvre. Because while Musk is now battling Trump, Congress, and his own booster-fuelled paranoia, Ramaswamy is free to reinvent himself as a centrist tech-whisperer in the Rust Belt. MAGA enough to get the base. Moderate enough to avoid the madness.Except MAGA, like any self-devouring revolution, doesn’t forget. Or forgive.Since stepping away from DOGE and softening his Trumpian rhetoric, Ramaswamy has found himself in the crosshairs of the same base that once anointed him their biotech Brahmin. Hardcore influencers have branded him a traitor. Conservative meme accounts now photoshop him next to Liz Cheney. And in the subterranean rage economy of right-wing internet culture, he's been rebranded from “America First entrepreneur” to “globalist plant with a Harvard tongue. ”Also read: Feud intensifies: Musk shares 1992 video; Trump seen with Jeffrey Epstein in clip The irony? The same mob now grilling Ramaswamy for “disloyalty” is turning on Musk for “disrespect.” In MAGAland, loyalty is a zero-sum blood sport, and the only acceptable exit is the one through public execution.DOGE, predictably, has become a political punchline. It was doomed from conception—run like a Reddit thread, branded like a crypto coin, and staffed by men who confuse spreadsheets with scripture. The only surprising thing is how quickly it crashed. Musk thought he could out-Trump Trump. But in MAGA-land, there can only be one sun god—and he’s orange, not emerald-mined.Ramaswamy, to his credit, didn’t wait around to become collateral damage. He understood what Musk didn’t: that proximity to Trump is radioactive. Stay too long and you mutate. Get out early and you might just survive.The result? Musk is in political freefall. Trump is in attack mode. And Ramaswamy? He’s in Ohio, sipping Perrier and talking about “innovation in public policy”—while ducking MAGA Twitter grenades and hoping they forget he ever existed.Call it foresight. Call it cowardice. Or just call it good political hygiene.Because as Sun Tzu said—he will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.And in the dystopian sitcom that is American politics, that makes Vivek Ramaswamy the guy who ghosted the group chat before the firestorm—and lived to run another episode.","Vivek Ramaswamy was the co-head of DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency.

Mirwaiz and Hurriyat Conference chairman Umar Farooq’s family has traditionally led prayers at the mosque for generations.“It is deeply regrettable that once again, people were not allowed to offer Eid prayers at the historic Jamia Masjid,” Omar said. He expressed helplessness, saying law and order in J&K Union territory fell under the purview of lieutenant governor (LG) Manoj Sinha’s administration. “I have no idea on what grounds such decisions are made,” the CM said.Omar urged the authorities to trust J&K’s residents, saying “these are the same people who, after the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, came forward and unequivocally condemned it”. The CM called on “the govt” to reconsider such actions in the future, alluding probably to the administration of the Centre-appointed LG.Mirwaiz Umar Farooq decried the mosque closure.“Yet again, Kashmir wakes up to the sad reality: no Eid prayers at Eidgah, and Jama Masjid locked down for 7th straight year. I, too, have been detained at my home. In a Muslim-majority region, Muslims are deprived of their fundamental right to pray even on their most important religious occasion celebrated across the world! What a shame on those who rule over us, and on those elected by the people who choose to remain silent as our rights are trampled over, again and again,” the Mirwaiz posted on X.J&K police and home department had not issued any statement on locking of the mosque and Mirwaiz’s detention.PDP president and former CM Mehbooba Mufti joined the condemnation, accusing the Omar-led govt of being “mere spectators”. “J&K is the only Muslim-majority region in the country, and yet it is here that a major mosque is shut down on Eid, denying people their right to offer prayers. If govt claims everything is normal in J&K, why is the Mirwaiz not allowed to offer prayers,” Mehbooba said.Asked about the restrictions, BJP functionary and J&K Waqf Board chairperson Darkshan Andrabi declined comment. “Jamia Masjid doesn’t come under Waqf Board,” she said.","Srinagar's historic Jamia Masjid locked and Mirwaiz Umar Farooq placed under house arrest on Eid-ul-Adha.

Significance of Eid al-Adha





As Muslims across the United Arab Emirates prepare to celebrate Eid al-Adha, one of the most important festivals in the Islamic calendar, the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments has officially announced the prayer timings for cities and regions across the country. Eid al-Adha prayers are held shortly after sunrise, typically around 15 to 20 minutes later. The timing varies slightly depending on the location. To help worshippers plan accordingly, here is a comprehensive list of prayer times according to Gulf News in each emirate and region for this auspicious occasion.Eid al-Adha, or the “Festival of Sacrifice,” commemorates the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son in obedience to God. It marks the end of the Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca and is celebrated with special prayers, family gatherings, charity, and the ritual sacrifice of animals. The meat is shared with family, friends, and those in need. The festival serves as a reminder of faith, selflessness, and devotion to God's command.","Eid al-Adha, or the “Festival of Sacrifice,” commemorates the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son in obedience to God.

Columbia University alumnus, currently facing deportation due to his pro-Palestinian activism, has detailed the significant ""irreparable harm"" due to his ongoing detention to his personal and professional life, while a federal judge considers his release.In court documents made public on Thursday, Mahmoud Khalil described how the “most immediate and visceral harms” due to his detention in Louisiana was him missing the birth of his firstborn in April, reported the Associated Press. ""Instead of holding my wife's hand in the delivery room, I was crouched on a detention centre floor, whispering through a crackling phone line as she laboured alone,"" the 30-year-old legal US resident wrote.

A devastating incident occurred aboard the Chhattisgarh Express when a 38-year-old disabled cricketer, Vikram Singh from Punjab, reportedly passed away while travelling from Delhi to Gwalior for a wheelchair cricket tournament. Singh’s health suddenly deteriorated during the journey, and despite numerous emergency calls, medical assistance failed to arrive in time.He passed away before the train reached Mathura station, despite repeated efforts to secure help.Singh and his teammates had boarded the Chhattisgarh Express from Hazrat Nizamuddin station on Wednesday night. He began experiencing severe pain shortly after departure, and his condition worsened rapidly as the train approached Mathura.According to reports, an emergency call was made to the railway helpline at 4:58 am, urgently requesting medical support. Despite several follow-up calls, no help materialised.The train was delayed by approximately 90 minutes and eventually reached Mathura station at 8:10 am. By then, Singh had already passed away.“He was in pain in front of our eyes. We kept calling for help, but it never came,” recounted one of his distraught teammates.At Mathura Junction, Government Railway Police (GRP) officials removed Singh’s body and arranged for a postmortem. The GRP has initiated formal proceedings, while railway authorities have launched an internal investigation into the delayed response.The incident has brought to light serious concerns about the effectiveness of Indian Railways ’ emergency medical systems.“This is not just a tragedy but a glaring reminder of the gaps in our railway medical emergency response,” said a senior player who was travelling with Vikram.The tragedy has prompted widespread outrage from disability rights advocates and the sporting community, who are questioning Indian Railways' ability to adequately support differently-abled passengers in emergency situations—especially when timely intervention is critical.","Disabled cricketer Vikram Singh, 38, died aboard the Chhattisgarh Express.

KOLKATA: Heavy rain on Friday night flooded the Dhapa dog pound, putting around 140 stray dogs at risk. It had been alleged that no senior KMC official came to the rescue of the dogs, who were struggling to survive.While majority of these dogs were picked up from streets across 144 KMC wards and shifted to the pound for sterilisation, others were brought there for treatment after being rescued.Several dog attendants, security guards, and pump operators spent a sleepless night as the storm water flooded the entire premises and had also entered the kennels, leaving the animals frightened.The situation was worse till Saturday afternoon as the adjacent neighbourhood had a poor drainage network, and hence the storm water took time to recede. However, an attendant of the dog pound expressed surprise over the absence of any senior officials from the KMC headquarters. According to a KMC health department source, a veterinary officer who was supposed to look after the dog pound was absent on Saturday. ""We were really helpless in battling the issue with no clear instruction from the senior officials. A veterinary doctor needs to examine the health of the stray dogs before we can sterilise them and release them from the spot from where they were picked up,"" said an attendant.As Dhapa dog pound is situated in a low-lying area, the storm waters from adjoining neighbourhoods flow down to this place (Dhapa), and the pound gets flooded every monsoon. ""Sensing an impending danger, the stray animals started barking aloud. At this point, we called a couple of pump operators and asked them to flush out the accumulated water from the dog pound complex as fast as they could. Two heavy-duty pumps were pressed into service, and that helped storm water from our complex to recede for the time being,"" said a civic employee posted at the dog pound.""We need to upgrade the drainage infrastructure of Dhapa dog pound immediately,"" the civic official said.","Heavy rain on Friday night flooded the Dhapa dog pound, putting around 140 stray dogs at risk.

US vice president JD Vance sought to ease growing tensions between US President Donald Trump and billionaire, Elon Musk , calling the Tesla CEO's recent outbursts emotional but well-intentioned.In an interview with comedian Theo Von released Friday, Vance said of Musk, “I think his heart is in a good place… in the right place, man. I do.”He added, “I think he got into this for the right reasons. I think he's frustrated. I think he's an emotional guy.”The remarks come amid a very public falling-out between Trump and Musk, who were once close allies. In recent days, Musk posted a series of sharp attacks on social media, calling for Congress to block Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” criticizing the president’s tax and spending plan, and even suggesting impeachment.Musk also claimed, without evidence,that the government was hiding information about Trump’s links to Jeffrey Epstein.Trump fired back, branding Musk “CRAZY” and threatening to cut off federal contracts to his companies, including Tesla, Starlink, and SpaceX “Look, it happens to everybody,” Vance said in the interview. “I’ve flown off the handle way worse than Elon Musk did in the last 24 hours.”He also said Trump had handled the criticism with restraint, saying the president felt some of the attacks were unfair but didn’t want to escalate things into a “blood feud.”“I actually think if Elon chilled out a little bit, everything would be fine,” Vance said.Despite the disagreement, Vance praised Musk as “an incredible entrepreneur” and defended the president’s bill, which Musk had heavily criticized. He said the bill’s main goal was not to cut spending, but to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts.Vance also praised Musk’s “department of government efficiency” initiative, which pushed for spending cuts and large-scale layoffs in federal agencies, calling it “really good.”","US vice president JD Vance sought to ease growing tensions between US President Donald Trump and billionaire, Elon Musk.

US vice president JD Vance on Saturday declared, ""Time to pass President Trump's beautiful bill and further secure the border,"" as protests intensified across the Los Angeles area in response to federal immigration enforcement raids.His remarks came amid growing unrest and a sweeping federal crackdown, including President Trump's deployment of 2,000 troops to help restore order.In a post on X, Vance slammed protestors clashing with immigration officers, writing: “Insurrectionists carrying foreign flags are attacking immigration enforcement officers, while one half of America's political leadership has decided that border enforcement is evil.”“For the far left rioters, some helpful advice; peaceful protest is good. Rioting and obstructing justice is not,” he added. “The president will deploy the national guard to quell these protests, and any person who violates the law or obstructs law enforcement will be aggressively prosecuted.”Reflecting on the previous administration’s immigration policies, Vance also weighed in on the legal framing of the current situation. “One of the main technical issues in the immigration judicial battles is whether Biden's border crisis counted as an ‘invasion,’” he said. “So now we have foreign nationals with no legal right to be in the country waving foreign flags and assaulting law enforcement. If only we had a good word for that…”The US vice president’s comments come as Trump continues a hardline immigration crackdown promised during his second-term campaign.On Saturday, the president ordered the deployment of troops to handle mounting unrest in California.Protests in the Los Angeles suburb of Paramount intensified for a second consecutive night. Demonstrators gathered near a Home Depot reportedly used as a staging ground by federal immigration officers.According to Fox 11 and multiple social media reports, federal agents in gas masks responded with flash-bang grenades and tear gas after attempts to disperse the crowd failed. A section of the freeway was also temporarily closed.FBI director Kash Patel backed law enforcement in a firm statement on Saturday, vowing that violence against officers would not be tolerated.“Hit a cop, you’re going to jail… doesn’t matter where you came from, how you got here, or what movement speaks to you,” Patel said. “If the local police force won’t back our men and women on the thin blue line, we FBI will.”California governor Gavin Newsom condemned the deployment of troops as “purposefully inflammatory,” accusing the Trump administration of stoking unrest.President Trump, since returning to office in January, has made immigration enforcement a top priority, describing undocumented migrants as “monsters” and “animals” in recent speeches.","US vice president JD Vance called on Congress to pass President Trump's 'beautiful' immigration bill.

MP horror: Girl gave birth in hosp toilet, reveals CCTV





MHOW: A stray dog was found feeding on a headless newborn inside a toilet of Mhow Civil Hospital in the wee hours of Saturday. The authorities are looking for a minor girl, who could be the baby's mother, reports Rajesh Jauhri.A female security guard came upon the grisly sight in the toilet of the general ward around 1:30am - the dog had the newborn's beheaded body in its jaws. Though horrified, the guard recovered from her shock and chased off the stray.The guard alerted hospital authorities and carried the mutilated remains to the mortuary. A search began for the mother. CCTV footage revealed that a young girl entered the toilet shortly before the incident, said Dr HR Verma, who is in charge of the hospital.“Records show the minor girl from a local village was admitted around 9pm on Friday with abdominal pain. Medical staff examined her and prescribed medications. Further tests were scheduled for the next morning. It is believed that the girl gave birth to the child in the toilet. She did not return to the ward and instead left the hospital with an unidentified individual,” said Verma.Local police have begun a probe. As per the hospital, preliminary reports indicate it was a premature delivery. It’s not yet known if the baby was stillborn.","A stray dog was found feeding on a headless newborn inside a toilet of Mhow Civil Hospital in the wee hours of Saturday.

Grant Hardin, convicted murderer and former police chief known as the “Devil in the Ozarks,” was recaptured Friday in Arkansas nearly two weeks after he escaped from the prison. Hardin has been transferred to the Varner SuperMax prison southeast of Little Rock.He was found just 1.5 miles northwest of the Calico Rock prison he escaped from. When officers approached, he tried to flee but was quickly tackled and taken into custody.Hardin, formerly the police chief of Gateway, Arkansas, disappeared from the North Central Unit, a medium-security prison in Calico Rock, less than 30 minutes before officials realised he was missing. According to the Arkansas department of corrections, he escaped wearing a ""makeshift"" law enforcement uniform.Hardin is currently serving a 30-year sentence for the 2017 murder of city employee James Appleton, along with a separate 50-year sentence for a 1997 rape, which was linked to him through DNA evidence in 2018.Search teams used drones, bloodhounds, and a helicopter during the manhunt. However, heavy rains raised water levels in nearby creeks and streams, making it difficult for both Hardin and the searchers to move through the rugged terrain.Prison system spokesperson Rand Champion said the area around Moccasin Creek was particularly hard to search earlier because of high water. “Search teams had looked through this area before, but the high water previously limited their ability to fully investigate.”Hardin had been imprisoned at Calico Rock since 2017 after pleading guilty to first-degree murder.A tower guard opened a secure gate, unknowingly allowing him to walk out. Authorities are now investigating why his identity wasn’t properly checked.Benton County prosecutor Bryan Sexton, who led the cases against Hardin for murder and rape, said he believed Hardin stayed in the northern Arkansas area. He kept victims and witnesses informed during the search.Now that Hardin has been caught, Sexton said the victims can begin to find closure. Cheryl Tillman, whose brother was shot by Hardin in 2017, called the capture a “big sigh of relief.”Sexton said he was relieved that Hardin is now in a more secure facility. The Varner Unit, opened in 1987, houses over 1,700 inmates, including high-risk and death row prisoners. Its supermax section is reserved for the most dangerous offenders, including those convicted of high-profile crimes.Hardin’s case drew national attention after it was featured in a documentary titled Devil in the Ozarks.","Grant Hardin, convicted murderer and former police chief known as the “Devil in the Ozarks,’ was recaptured Friday in Arkansas.

This was denied by Andriy Kovalenko, an official with Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, who said Moscow should stop ""playing dirty games"" and return to constructive work.Overnight, Russian forces used high-precision long-range weapons and drones to attack military targets in Ukraine, hitting all of them, according to Russia's defence ministry.The northeastern city of Kharkiv, one of Ukraine's largest, is just a few dozen kilometres from the Russian border and has been under frequent Russian shelling during more than three years of war triggered by Russia's full-scale invasion.""Kharkiv is currently experiencing the most powerful attack since the start of the full-scale war,"" mayor Ihor Terekhov said in a post on Telegram earlier on Saturday.Residential buildings, educational and infrastructure facilities were attacked, he said, and photos showed buildings burnt and reduced partially to rubble, as rescuers carried the wounded away for treatment.A Ukrainian drone attack deep inside Russian territory last weekend likely damaged around 10% of Russia's strategic bomber fleet and hit some of the aircraft. afp","Russian forces used high-precision long-range weapons and drones to attack military targets in Ukraine, hitting all of them.

Did you never think Epstein was killed, Rogan asks Kash Patel





FBI director Kash Patel came clean about the Epstein Files on a surprise Joe Rogan Experience episode that dropped a day after Elon Musk claimed that President Donald Trump is named in the Epstein Files and that's why they are not releasing it. The timing of the episode caught JRE fans by surprise as it was shot when Elon Musk and Donald trump were nuking each other. Kash Patel was seen smoking and talking in details about FBI and Epstein Files.Steering clear of Elon-Trump drama, Kash Patel said people are pissed at him for the delay in releasing the Epstein files. He said he was not there when Jeffrey Epstein did the abominable act with the protection of a section of media who chose to protect Epstein because of the connections he had.Claiming that Epstein killed himself, Patel asked if anyone thinks that he and Dan Bongino would protect any information regarding the pedophile. Patel said it was the decision of the Donald Trump administration that all files would be released and they will be released ""as much as possible"", Patel said.The FBI director added that he knows that he would not be able to convince anyone that Epstein did kill himself in the prison cell, no matter how many files the FBI releases, because there have been 15 years of people coming in and creating fiction.Joe Rogan asked Kash Patel what he used to think about Epstein's death before he became the FBI director. Patel said he never had a suspicion that Epstein was killed in his cell and said that he had a different background that made him acquainted with jails as a public defender. He said he knew people who committed suicides in cell and based on the information publicly available to him at that time, he always believed that it was not possible for anyone to enter Epstein's cell and kill him.Patel said the FBi would release the video of the cell and everybody would be able to see whether Epstein killed himself or not.When Joe Rogan presented several opinions of doctors who claimed that Epstein's death and his injuries looked more like a murder and not suicide, Kash Patel called it a 'war of experts'. He said this war of experts where there will always be someone to say something in contrary will go on for years, but his current job as the FBI director is to present the public with absolutely everything.","Kash Patel said he was not there when Jeffrey Epstein did the abominable act with the protection of a section of media who chose to protect Epstein.

Thomas Fugate, a 22-year-old with a background in gardening and grocery store work, has been appointed by US President Donald Trump to head the center for prevention programs and partnerships (CP3) at the department of homeland Security (DHS).Just five years ago, Fugate was working as a neighborhood gardener. As recently as August 2023, he held a job at a grocery store. A 2023 graduate of the University of Texas at San Antonio, Fugate has experienced a swift rise through Republican political circles.Fugate’s LinkedIn page shows limited experience in the national security or policy field. In 2020, he listed himself as a self-employed “landscape business owner.” He also worked as a “cross functional team member” at an H-E-B supermarket in Austin, Texas.After completing his degree in politics and law, Fugate joined Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign as an “advance team member.” He has also interned at the conservative Heritage foundation and with Texas state representatives Terry Wilson and Steve Allison.In February, he was reportedly hired as a special assistant in an immigration office at DHS.Following the resignation of the previous CP3 director, Fugate was named as the acting head of the center.“Tom Fugate has performed well in his current role as a confidential assistant in our immigration & border security suboffice,” a DHS official told The Daily Beast.“Due to his success, he has been temporarily given additional leadership responsibilities in the center for prevention programs and partnerships office (CP3). This is a credit to his work ethic and success on the job.”Earlier posts from his X account show a different tone, one of interest in global aid, LEGO, Star Wars, and international development. In past tweets, he encouraged Texas lawmakers to support the international affairs budget and aid for the global poor.Fugate later shifted toward a MAGA-aligned political image, rebranding himself with the “thomas4texas” Instagram handle and announcing his entry into public service. His online profiles reflect a carefully constructed persona, including a LinkedIn photo in front of the DHS seal, hinting at confidence and ambition.His rapid promotion has sparked questions about experience and readiness, but DHS officials have stood by the decision, citing his work ethic and current performance.","Thomas Fugate, a 22-year-old with a background in gardening and grocery store work, has been appointed by US President Donald Trump to head the department of homeland Security.

AQAP: Once al-Qaeda's most dangerous branch



‘Trump Must Bleed’: Al-Qaeda Leader’s Terrifying Message, Issues Death Treat In New Video

Gaza conflict draws in regional militants







The leader of al-Qaeda's Yemen branch has issued threats against US President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, marking his first public appearance since taking control of the group in 2024.In a half-hour video released online early Saturday by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) supporters, Saad bin Atef al-Awlaki called for retaliatory attacks and urged lone-wolf militants to assassinate leaders in Egypt, Jordan, and Gulf Arab nations over their roles in the conflict, which he described as devastating to Palestinians in Gaza.The video featured images of Trump, Musk, US Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, along with logos of Musk's companies, including Tesla.“There are no red lines after what happened and is happening to our people in Gaza,"" al-Awlaki declared. ""Reciprocity is legitimate.”Though weakened in recent years by internal divisions and US drone strikes, AQAP was long considered al-Qaeda's most dangerous branch following the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden . The group has retained influence in Yemen and continues to advocate for global jihad.Al-Awlaki, who has a $6 million US bounty on his head, is accused by Washington of inciting attacks against the US and its allies.He succeeded former leader Khalid al-Batarfi, whose death AQAP confirmed in 2024.AQAP’s threats come as Yemen’s Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, have also drawn global attention for launching missiles at Israel and attacking ships in the Red Sea, prompting a heavy US naval response. The Pentagon has described the ongoing conflict with the Houthis as the most intense combat since World War II.Though the Houthis and AQAP have historically been at odds, the Shiite Houthis and Sunni AQAP fought bitterly in Yemen’s civil war, AQAP’s attacks on Houthi targets have decreased in recent years, while the group continues to strike forces from the Saudi-led coalition.UN estimates suggest AQAP retains a network of 3,000 to 4,000 active fighters and supporters. The group funds its operations through bank robberies, smuggling, counterfeiting, and ransom activities.As the Houthis gain popularity across the Arab world for confronting Israel, experts believe al-Awlaki is using the Gaza war to reclaim AQAP’s relevance.“For a national security and foreign policy community increasingly disengaged from Yemen, this video is a clear reminder: Yemen still matters,” said Mohammed al-Basha of the Basha Report.“As the Houthis gain popularity as leaders of the Arab and Muslim world's 'resistance' against Israel, al-Awlaki seeks to challenge their dominance by presenting himself as equally concerned about the situation in Gaza,” he added.","Saad bin Atef al-Awlaki urges lone-wolf militants to assassinate leaders in Egypt, Jordan, and Gulf Arab nations over their roles in the conflict.

"8 hours on wrong plane: American Airlines flight too big for destination airport in Italy, diverted to Rome",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/8-hours-on-wrong-plane-american-airlines-flight-too-big-for-destination-airport-in-italy-diverted-to-rome/articleshow/121698766.cms,"American Airlines (Representative image)





An American Airlines plane carrying passengers from Philadelphia to Naples had to make a sudden mid-air diversion after the pilots understood that the Boeing 787-9 that they were flying was not certified to land at Naples Airport; it was too big for the airport. The incident took place on June 2, and the airlines said the diversion to Rome was due to operational reasons.American Airlines Flight AA780 departed Philadelphia at 7:42 PM and crossed the Atlantic without incident. It was supposed to land in Naples at 10 am local time. But as the aircraft began its descent into Naples (NAP), the crew altered course and redirected the flight to Rome Fiumicino Airport, approximately 124 miles away from the destination. The passengers were bused from Rome to Naples which takes two hours.Historical flight data shows that American Airlines usually sends a Boeing 787-8 on flights to Naples. While these two Dreamliner variants are pretty similar, with the same wingspan, the 787-9 is actually 20 feet longer.Flight 780 had to change course over the Tyrrhenian Sea. The 787-8 is small enough to land at an airport with a Category 8 RFFS, but the 787-9 needs a Category 9 RFFS airport.Aviation enthusiast @xJonNYC, who first shared the incident on X, reported that the airport authority said 787-9 planes can't land in Naples.After landing at Rome Fiumicino Airport around 9:45 a.m., passengers were transported to Naples by bus, the airline spokesperson told Business Insider. ""We apologize to them for this disruption to their journey,"" they added. The 787-9 departed Rome two-and-a-half hours later, operating Flight 111 to Chicago, per Flightradar24.","Boeing 787-9 was not certified to land at Naples Airport.

Trump vs Musk: President warns Tesla CEO of 'very serious consequences’ if he backs Democrats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-vs-musk-president-warns-tesla-ceo-of-very-serious-consequences-if-he-backs-democrats/articleshow/121698494.cms,"



US President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Elon Musk, threatening ""serious consequences"" if the tech billionaire chooses to support Democratic candidates in retaliation against Republicans who back the GOP's budget bill.Speaking to NBC News in a telephonic interview on Saturday, Trump did not clarify what those consequences might be, but said, “If he does, he’ll have to pay the consequences for that,” adding, “very serious consequences.”The confrontation came after a dramatic rift between the president and Musk, who was once one of Trump’s most prominent financial backers. Musk contributed more than $250 million to Trump’s 2024 campaign efforts and briefly served as head of the department of government efficiency during Trump’s term, where he oversaw extensive cuts across federal departments.But in recent days, the relationship has unravelled in public view. The fallout began with Musk criticising the House-passed “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” on his social platform X, arguing the GOP spending plan was unsustainable and would trigger an economic downturn.Responding to Musk’s criticism on Thursday he said, “I’m very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill. I’m very disappointed in Elon.I’ve helped Elon a lot.”Musk retaliated with a series of posts, many of them now deleted, including one calling for Trump’s impeachment and another reviving long-discussed allegations about Trump’s links to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.“That’s called ‘old news,’” Trump said on Saturday, dismissing the resurfaced claims. “Even Epstein’s lawyer said I had nothing to do with it.”Asked whether he planned to repair his relationship with the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, Trump said curtly, “No,” and confirmed that he believed their relationship was effectively over, “I would assume so, yeah.”Trump added that he had “no intention” of speaking with Musk again. “I’m too busy doing other things,” he said.He also accused Musk of being “disrespectful to the office of the President,” stating, “You could not disrespect the office of the President.”Despite calls from conservative allies like Steve Bannon for federal scrutiny into Musk’s business dealings, Trump said he hadn’t discussed any such action. “It’s not something that’s on top of my mind right now,” he said.However, in a Truth Social post earlier this week, Trump did hint at possible retaliation, writing, “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.”“I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!”Despite the public feud, Trump struck an upbeat note about the GOP's budget bill, expressing confidence it would pass the Senate by July 4. “The Republican Party has never been united like this before,” he said. “Actually, more so than it was three days ago.”","US President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Elon Musk, threatening ""serious consequences"" if the tech billionaire chooses to support Democratic candidates.
