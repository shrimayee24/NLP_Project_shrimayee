NEW DELHI: The father of the minor accused in Pune Porsche car crash which killed two people was sent to two-day police custody on Wednesday. The father, Vishal Agarwal , argued in court that he had sent a driver with his 17-year-old son. The court, however, sent him to judicial custody . The Pune Police had sought 7-day custody of the father.Speaking about the hearing, advocate Asim Saraode, who was arguing on the behalf of the intervener against giving bail to the father, told news agency ANI, ""He tried to present an argument that he had sent a driver with his accused son.Then why was the driver not driving the car and the person with no licence was driving the car?"" Blaming the father for the accident , Saraode said that the father ""failed to protect his minor son"". ""The case is well discussed throughout the nation and the father is at fault as he failed to protect his minor son...,"" he said. The minor boy, who the police claim was drunk at the time of the accident, fatally knocked down two motorbike-borne software engineers in the Kalyani Nagar area of Pune city in the early hours of May 19.The car accident claimed the lives of Anish Awadhiya and Ashwini Koshta, both 24-year-old IT professionals hailing from Madhya Pradesh and working in Pune. After the car crash, the police had registered a case against the teenager's father under sections 75 and 77 of the Juvenile Justice Act and relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Section 75 deals with ""wilful neglect of a child or exposing a child to mental or physical illnesses"" while section 77 deals with supplying a child with intoxicating liquor or drugs.The father, a prominent builder, is facing charges of giving his son his high-end car to drive despite knowing that the latter did not have a driving licence nor was he trained to drive the car and that his son consumed alcohol. The builder was detained from a lodge in Sambhajinagar, while his driver and associate were picked from a hotel. The builder attempted to outsmart the cops after fleeing the city. He sent one of his vehicles towards Mumbai and another to Goa. He borrowed a vehicle from an associate but it had a GPS fitted in it.The court has sent the father to judicial custody till May 24.The Madhya Pradesh-based parents of the victims of the car accident in Maharashtra's Pune on Tuesday sought stringent punishment for the accused boy as well as his parents, accusing them of being responsible for the death of their children.""We were supposed to send her off in a palanquin (to the groom's house) after her marriage (in future), but now we were forced to carry her body on a bier,"" Ashwini's inconsolable mother Mamata Koshta told PTI in Jabalpur after performing her last rites. ""We want justice for Ashwini. The minor boy and his parents should get stringent punishment. They have not raised him properly... They should have not given him the car,"" she said.Before the accident, the teen along with his friends drank alcohol at two pubs in the city - Cosie and Blak Mariott. He spent Rs 48,000 in 90 minutes at Cosie which the teen and his friends visited at 10.40pm on Saturday evening. They left for the second pub, Blak Mariott, at 12.10am after Cosie stopped serving them.The police have also arrested Naman Bhutada (25), the owner of the Cosie pub in Mundhwa, and Sachin Kaatkar (35), a staff member at the establishment. Additionally, Sandip Sangle (35), an assistant restaurant manager at the Blak Marriott pub, also located in Mundhwa, has been taken into custody.

(IANS)

PUNE: The 17-year-old son of a prominent Pune builder spent Rs 48,000 in 90 minutes at one of the two pubs that he visited before ramming his Porsche Taycan into a motorcycle in the early hours of Sunday, snuffing out the lives of two young techies .Pune police commissioner Amitesh Kumar said that the Rs 48,000-bill was paid at Cosie, the first pub that the teen and his friends visited at 10.40 pm on Saturday evening.They left for the second pub, Blak Mariott , at 12.10 am after Cosie stopped serving them. ""We have obtained the bill of Rs 48,000 at the pub which the underage driver paid. The bill includes the cost of the liquor served to the teenager and his friends at the pub,"" said Kumar.ACP Manoj Patil said, ""The teenager had visited pubs and consumed alcohol before driving his car. We have ample CCTV footage of the boy and his group consuming alcohol. The blood sample reports are still awaited.""Even though the blood reports are awaited, based on the circumstances and the evidence collected so far, Pune police Tuesday invoked section 185 (drink driving) of the Motor Vehicle Act against the 17-year-old.Responding to a query about Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut's allegation that Pune police in collusion with an MLA acted in a manner that favoured the teenager, the police commissioner said there was no question of any favouritism or political pressure. ""We have proceeded legally right from the beginning, and I dare any legal expert to come forward and point out if the police could have acted in any other manner than what they have done so far,"" Kumar added.Maharashtra’s leader of opposition Vijay Wadettiwar demanded on Tuesday a judicial inquiry into the Pune accident that claimed the lives of two techies early Sunday, reports Vaibhav Ganjapure.In a post on ‘X’, the Bramhapuri MLA raised doubts about the effectiveness of Pune police’s investigation and highlighted disparities between CCTV footage and the police report.Rahul Gandhi has questioned why “preferential treatment” was meted out to a wealthy 17-year-old drunken boy who killed two persons. “When a teen from a rich family consumes alcohol and kills two people with his Porsche, he is told to pen an ‘essay’.

Relief flight arrives in Singapore

FAA warning

More than 140 passengers and crew from a Singapore Airlines flight hit by heavy turbulence that left dozens injured and one dead finally reached Singapore on a relief flight Wednesday morning after an emergency landing in Bangkok The scheduled London-Singapore flight on a Boeing 777-300ER plane diverted to Bangkok after the plane was buffeted by turbulence that flung passengers and crew around the cabin, slamming some into the ceiling.A 73-year-old British passenger died of a suspected heart attack, and at least 30 people were injured. ""I saw people from across the aisle going completely horizontal, hitting the ceiling and landing back down in like really awkward positions. People, like, getting massive gashes in the head, concussions,"" Dzafran Azmir, a 28-year-old student onboard the flight, told Reuters after arriving in Singapore.Photographs from the interior of the plane showed gashes in the overhead cabin panels, oxygen masks and panels hanging from the ceiling, and luggage strewn around. A passenger said some people's heads had slammed into the lights above the seats and broken the panels.Singapore Airlines took 131 passengers and 12 crew on the relief flight from Bangkok, which reached Singapore just before 5am (2100 GMT). There were 211 passengers including many Australians, British, and Singaporeans, and 18 crew onboard the original flight; injured fliers and their families remained in Bangkok.""On behalf of Singapore Airlines, I would like to express my deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of the deceased,"" Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong said in a video message.Singapore's Transport Safety Investigation Bureau (TSIB) is looking into the incident, and the US National Transportation Safety Board is also sending representatives for support.The plane encountered sudden extreme turbulence, Goh said, and the pilot then declared a medical emergency and diverted to Bangkok. Aircraft tracking provider FlightRadar 24 said at about 0749 GMT the flight encountered ""a rapid change in vertical rate, consistent with a sudden turbulence event,"" based on flight tracking data. ""There were thunderstorms, some severe, in the area at the time,"" it said.Weather forecasting service AccuWeather on Tuesday said rapidly developing, explosive thunderstorms near the flight path of Flight 321 most likely contributed to violent turbulence. ""Developing thunderstorms often have strong updrafts, a zone of upward moving air, that rises very rapidly, sometimes at more than 100 mph, and can leave pilots with little time to react if it occurs directly in front of the plane,"" said Dan DePodwin, AccuWeather’s Senior Director of Forecasting Operations.The sudden turbulence occurred over the Irrawaddy Basin in Myanmar, about 10 hours into the flight, Singapore Airlines said. ""It is not a rare occurrence for big thunderstorms in the Bay of Bengal. There are always the chances of bumps,"" said an airline pilot who regularly flies to Singapore and Southeast Asia. The pilot declined to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media.""Turbulence can be unexpected and happen anywhere. Keep your seatbelt buckled at all times, even when the sign is off,"" the U.S. regulator FAA said on Wednesday on X in reaction to the Singapore Airlines incident.Singapore Airlines, which is widely recognized as one of the world's leading airlines and is seen as a benchmark for much of the industry, has not had any major incidents in recent years. Its last accident resulting in casualties was a flight from Singapore to Los Angeles via Taipei, where it crashed on Oct. 31, 2000, at the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, killing 83 of the 179 people on board.Singapore Airlines shares were not trading on Wednesday because of a public holiday in Singapore.(With inputs from agencies)","More than 140 passengers and crew from a Singapore Airlines flight hit by heavy turbulence that left dozens injured and one dead.

Police had sought cancellation of the teen's bail arguing that he should be tried as an adult for drink driving and smashing his car into a two-wheeler at a speed of 160kmph that led to the death of two techies.JJB sent the juvenile to an observation home till June 5.The order came a day after Maharashtra deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis expressed ""shock and surprise"" over the board releasing the teen on bail conditions such as writing a 300-word essay on accidents, visiting the RTO to study traffic rules, and assist RTO officers for 15 days. The JJB's order had led to a countrywide outrage amid charges of favouritism levelled by the opposition.Additional commissioner of police Manoj Patil said after the JJB's order, a committee will now be set up under Section 15 of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act to monitor the teenager at the observation home and carry out psychological tests and counselling. Section 15 empowers JJB to conduct a preliminary inquiry to determine whether a child in conflict with law is to be sent for rehabilitation or be tried as an adult. ""Based on this committee's report, a call will be taken on whether the teenager is to be treated as an adult for trial,"" Patil said.Special assistant public prosecutor Monali Kale told TOI that police had primarily argued that the teenager needed proper rehabilitation as he was addicted to alcohol. ""We argued there was a threat to his life if he remained outside the observation home. He is young, and considering his future, he can be referred to a psychiatrist for counselling as and when required.""Lawyer Prashant Patil, who represented the teenager, said JJB pronounced the operative part of its order on Wednesday evening and the full text would be released in due course.

EU condolences 'big disappointment'

Iran 's Ebrahim Raisi was a year away from the end of his first presidential term when he died on May 20. Raisi, his Foreign Minister Hussein Amirabdollahian, and six other people — including two pilots — lost their lives when the helicopter transporting them went down near the Azerbaijani border.Raisi ""died as a martyr serving his country,"" said Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei State media outlets showed images and videos aimed to underline Raisi's popularity during his commemoration. According to the head of Iran's state broadcaster, millions of people had rushed to Tehran to attend the ceremony honoring the late president.""In a country where there are no real polls and free elections, they are forced to seek legitimacy in crowds around coffins,"" exiled Iranian journalist Mohammad Javed Akbarin commented in an online post. The right to free assembly, according to Akbarin, is not guaranteed to all Iran's citizens.Indeed, after Raisi's death was confirmed, Iran's judiciary warned that ""any acts of protest which jeopardize national security and hurt the emotions of grievers will be punished.""The case of reporter Manizheh Moazen shows this is no idle threat. After Raisi's death, she reposted a tweet emphasizing the president's role in the mass executions of political prisoners in the 1980s.""Due to my reaction to the death of Ebrahim Riasi, the judiciary has opened a case against me,"" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter.""Raisi never regretted his actions,"" Iranian writer and activist Shadi Amin told DW. The activist, currently based in Germany, focuses on helping people from Iran's LGBTQ+ community and other minority groups.""For over 40 years, Raisi has always been playing an important role in implementing the policies of the Islamic Republic, predominantly in suppressing the civilian population,"" she added.Raisi was 63 years old when he died. He started building his career early, joining the judiciary as a young cleric immediately after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and quickly making his way into the so-called death commission responsible for killing thousands of political prisoners. He then continued his career as a judge, becoming chief justice in 2019, and eventually president in 2021.In an interview following the 2021 election, Raisi defended his record in Iran's judiciary.""If a judge, a prosecutor or a lawyer defend the people's security, they should be praised for it,"" he told reporters, commenting on the mass killings in the 1980s.As president, Raisi played a key role in suppressing the protests against the Iranian regime that kept flaring up across the country, most recently after the death of Jina Mahsa Amini in September 2022.""He called for the implementation of misogynic law including the mandatory headscarves for women,"" according to Shadi Amin.At the same time, Shadi Amin points out that Iran's religious leaders have the last word on practically any topic in the country.""In recent years, there have been enough people who, like Raisi, have been brought in this system and are ready to act against the civilian population in harsh and brutal ways,"" said Amin. ""The only thing I regret are the condolences coming from the European Union and international organizations for a mass murder such as him.

NEW DELHI: The International Criminal Court (ICC) is pursuing arrest warrants for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Israel's defense minister Yoav Gallant, and two other top Hamas leaders, Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri (also known as Mohammed Deif) and Ismail Haniyeh, according to a statement released by ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan on Monday.The charges are related to the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza, which Khan alleges constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity .The charges against Sinwar, Haniyeh, and al-Masri include ""extermination, murder, taking of hostages, rape and sexual assault in detention"", while the charges against Netanyahu and Gallant include ""causing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict,"" said Khan in his statement.The ICC's decision to target Netanyahu marks the first time the court has sought an arrest warrant for the top leader of a close US ally, placing him in the same category as Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is also facing an ICC arrest warrant over the war in Ukraine.A panel of ICC judges will now consider Khan's application for the arrest warrants.Israel's top leaders slammed the development as a ""historical disgrace"".A furious Netanyahu lashed out at the ICC and the prosecutor, stating that the ""absurd"" move was ""exactly what new anti-Semitism looks like"".Vowing to bring down Hamas and achieve total victory, Netanyahu said Israel was fighting a ""just war"".Israel's foreign minister Israel Katz also hit out at the ICC chief prosecutor, stating: ""The Attorney General in the same breath mentions the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence of the State of Israel alongside the abominable Nazi monsters of Hamas -- a historical disgrace that will be remembered forever.""Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz slammed the move which he said draws ""parallels between the leaders of a democratic country determined to defend itself from despicable terror to leaders of a blood-thirsty terror organisation (Hamas)"". ""It is a deep distortion of justice and blatant moral bankruptcy,"" he added.Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri also panned the ICC prosecutor's move, stating that the decision ""equates the victim with the executioner"" and encourages Israel to continue its ""war of extermination"" in Gaza.Wasel Abu Youssef, member of the Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee, said: ""The Palestinian people have the right to defend themselves ... The ICC is required to issue arrest warrants against Israeli officials who are pursuing crimes of genocide in the Gaza Strip.""When reports of the potential ICC action surfaced last month, Netanyahu called it ""an outrage of historic proportions"" and asserted that Israel has an independent legal system that thoroughly investigates all violations of the law. In response to Netanyahu's comments, Khan stated, ""Nobody is above the law,"" and advised Israel to raise a challenge before the court's judges if they disagree with the ICC's jurisdiction.Although Israel and the US are not members of the ICC, the court claims jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court's founding principles in 2015.The US also slammed the ICC prosecutor's move, stating that such a ""shameful"" decision puts ""truce talks at risk"".""We reject the prosecutor's equivalence of Israel with Hamas ... The ICC arrest decisions could jeopardise efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement, hostage deal and to increase humanitarian aid in Gaza,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.","ICC pursuing arrest warrants for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's defense minister Yoav Gallant.

NEW DELHI: Mohammad Mokhber who was Iran's first vice president, has been appointed as the interim president following Mohammad Raisi's death in a chopper crash on May 19. Born on September 1, 1955, in Dezful, Khuzestan Province, he has a background in business administration and management. Known for his close ties to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei , Mokhber assumed the role of first vice president in 2021 following Ebrahim Raisi 's election as president.In his capacity as interim president, Mokhber is part of a three-person council, along with the Speaker of Parliament and the head of the judiciary, responsible for organizing a new presidential election within 50 days if the president dies.Mokhber held several significant positions in Iran's economic and industrial sectors, notably serving as the head of Setad, an investment fund linked to the Supreme Leader. Setad, officially the Headquarters for Executing the Order of the Imam, was established by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to manage and sell properties abandoned after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, with proceeds primarily directed to charity.Mokhber was also involved in international dealings and was part of a delegation that visited Moscow in October, agreeing to supply surface-to-surface missiles and drones to Russia's military. This delegation included senior officials from Iran's Revolutionary Guards and an official from the Supreme National Security Council.His activities have led to international scrutiny. In 2010, the European Union sanctioned Mokhber for alleged involvement in nuclear or ballistic missile activities, though he was removed from the list two years later. In 2013, the US Treasury Department sanctioned Setad and 37 associated companies.Mokhber was previously the head of Setad, an investment fund linked to the Supreme Leader.

Lawsuits claim 66 people were abused as children in Pennsylvania's juvenile facilities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/lawsuits-claim-66-people-were-abused-as-children-in-pennsylvanias-juvenile-facilities/articleshow/110341983.cms,"HARRISBURG: Dozens of children who were sent to juvenile detention centers and similar facilities in Pennsylvania suffered physical and sexual abuse including violent rapes, according to four related lawsuits filed Wednesday.The lawsuits describe how 66 people, now adults, say they were victimized by guards, nurses, supervisors and others. Some attacks were reported to other staffers and were ignored or met with disbelief, the lawsuits allege.Their claims point to a broken juvenile justice system in Pennsylvania, said Jerome Block, a New York lawyer whose firm filed the new cases and is helping pursue similar lawsuits in Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey and Michigan.“The purpose of the juvenile justice system is to rehabilitate and educate and reform, to equip them to lead healthy, productive lives,” Block said in a phone interview before filing the suits. “Instead these men and women were sexually traumatized as children. They came to these facilities needing help. Instead, they had trauma inflicted upon them.”The lawsuits involve the Loysville Youth Development Center, the South Mountain Secure Treatment Unit and the North Central Secure Treatment Unit in Danville, all under the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services; Merakey USA’s Northwestern Academy outside Shamokin, which closed in 2016; and facilities run by Tucson, Arizona-based VisionQuest National Ltd. and Villanova-based Devereux Advanced Behavioral Health.Copies of the lawsuit were emailed Wednesday morning, seeking comment, to spokespeople for the Department of Human Services, Devereux and Merakey. Several messages were left in recent days for VisionQuest.All of those who are suing were born after Nov. 26, 1989, and meet the state's legal standards for filing claims of sexual abuse when they were children.Block said the legal team also represents more than 100 people who were similarly abused, but too long ago under time limits to file civil claims. Proposals to open a two-year window for such outdated claims have been blocked by Senate Republicans in the General Assembly.Eighteen of the latest plaintiffs describe rapes and other sexual abuse at Devereux facilities. One man says that when he was 14, while sedated during “major anger outbreaks,” a staff member sexually abused him while he was restrained “so he could not fight back.”Other claims, by 15 people who were confined at the state-run facilities, say children there “have long been subjected to a culture of exploitation, violence and rampant sexual abuse"" committed by guards, counselors and other staff.“The sexual abuse at commonwealth juvenile detention facilities has ranged from inappropriate strip searches to rape using violent physical force,” according to their lawsuit, which alleges negligence and failed oversight.One of the plaintiffs says she became pregnant as a teenager as the result of a violent rape by a counselor at North Central about 20 years ago, and that another staffer didn’t believe her when she reported the rape. The lawsuit doesn't describe what happened regarding her pregnancy.Merakey USA, which operated Northwestern Academy before it shut down in 2016, is accused of a “culture of sexual abuse and brutality,” including “inappropriate and criminal sexual relationships with children,” who were granted or denied privileges to pressure them into sex.That lawsuit says one 14-year-old girl who had not been sexually active was forced into sex acts by two Northwestern Academy staffers, and when she complained, she was accused of lying and her home leave passes were removed.A male therapist then had her write about her sexual encounters during twice-a-week sessions for five months, telling her it was treatment for sex addiction and for a book he was writing. When she asked for the book upon leaving the facility, its director told her the book did not exist and her experience ""would not be considered mental health treatment,” the lawsuit says.A task force to address problems in Pennsylvania's approach to juvenile justice — established by legislative leaders, the court system and then-Gov. Tom Wolf — concluded in 2021 that too many first-time and lower level juvenile offenders were being locked up, and Black offenders were disproportionately prosecuted as adults.A Democratic-sponsored bill to adopt some of the task force’s recommended changes is pending in the House after passing the Judiciary Committee in September on a party-line vote, with all Republicans opposed. There has also been a decades-long effort to establish an independent Office of Child Advocate. Supporters say talks about such legislation are currently ongoing.Malik Pickett, a senior attorney at Juvenile Law Center in Philadelphia, said the lawsuits ""ring far too familiar for what we know from our nearly 50 years of advocacy.”The state's youth detention facilities are dangerous places for children, his emailed statement said.""We have experienced one crisis for youth in detention after another,"" Pickett said, while failing to pass meaningful changes.","66 people, now adults, say they were victimized by guards, nurses, supervisors and others.

He added that temperatures could reach up to 6 degrees Celsius (10.8 Fahrenheit) above the monthly average. This week could rise above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in many parts of the country, Babar said.It's the latest climate-related disaster to hit the country in recent years. Melting glaciers and growing monsoons have caused devastating floods, at one point submerging a third of the country.Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961, with more than double the usual monthly rainfall, according to the national weather center. Last month's heavy rains killed scores of people while destroyed property and farmland, experts say the country witnessed heavier rains because of climate change .Pakistan is still trying to recover from $30 billion in losses caused by devastating climate-induced floods that killed 1,739 people in 2022.According to health officials, hospitals were instructed to set up emergency heatwave response centers so that those affected by the scorching temperatures could be quickly treated.Doctors say heatstroke is a serious illness that occurs when one's body temperature rises quickly because of sweltering heat, potentially causing some to fall unconscious. A severe heatstroke can cause disability or death.Some areas in Pakistan are also currently facing hours-long power outages.""We were without electricity for hours on Monday,"" said Ibrar Abbasi, who lives on the outskirts of Islamabad.Scientists have long warned that climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and certain agricultural practices, will lead to more frequent and prolonged bouts of extreme weather, including hotter temperatures.Babar said another intense heat wave will hit the country in June, when the temperature is likely to reach 45 degrees (113 Fahrenheit). He said people should drink a lot of water and avoid unnecessary travel. Farmers and other livestock owners should take measures to protect their animals during extreme heat, he said.However, many people, especially laborers and construction workers in the impoverished nation, ask how they can stay indoors as their families will suffer if they don't work.""I am not feeling well because of the stifling heat, but I have to work,"" said Ghulam Farid, who owns a small general store in Sheikhupra, a city in Punjab province.Construction workers were seen sitting near a road on the outskirts of the capital, Islamabad, hoping to get a job.

NEW YORK: In perhaps the first acknowledgement of its kind on a global forum that the ""new India is a dangerous entity"", Pakistan 's Permanent Ambassador to the United Nations, Munir Akram said, invoking the alleged targeted and extra-judicial assassinations in his homeland and elsewhere.Pakistan's permanent representative at the world body also quoted from a report in a leading US daily to say the ""new India comes into your home and kills you"".Addressing the General Assembly on May 2, Akram said, ""Pakistan's foreign minister informed the Security Council, as well as the secretary general and the president of the General Assembly of India's campaign of targeted assassinations in Pakistan. This extra-territorial state terrorism is not limited to Pakistan. It has been extended to targeted killings of political opponents in Canada and attempted in the United States and probably in other countries.""""The Washington Post reported that Prime Minister Modi last week told his cheering supporters, and I quote, ""Today, even India's enemies know this is Modi. This is the new India. This new India comes into your home and kills you"". This new India is a dangerous entity, it is a net provider of insecurity, not security,"" Pakistan's permanent representative to the UN alleged.Earlier, top British daily, The Guardian, claimed in a report that the Indian government carried out assassinations of wanted individuals deep inside Pakistan as part of a ""wider strategy to eliminate terrorists living on foreign soil"".It said, citing intelligence sources, that targeted assassinations increased significantly in 2023, claiming India's involvement in the suspected deaths of about 15 people, ""most of whom were shot at close range by unknown gunmen"".Earlier, some countries in the West raised concerns over what they claimed were targeted killings on their soil at the behest of the Indian government.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused 'agents' allegedly in the employ of the Indian government of killing Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a pro-Khalistan leader and a designated terrorist by the country's elite National Investigation Agency (NIA), in 2020.However, India has dismissed the claim as 'absurd' and 'motivated'.Nijjar was shot and killed as he came out of a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year. A purported video clip of his killing that reportedly surfaced in March, this year, showing Nijjar being shot by armed men in what was alleged to be a 'contract killing'.In a recent development in the Nijjar case, the Canadian Police arrested four Indian nationals for their alleged involvement in the killing of the separatist Khalistleader outside a gurudwara in British Columbia last June.Reacting to the arrests, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar denied receiving any evidence implicating Indian nationals' involvement in the killing in Canada of the India-designated terrorist.Responding to media queries, Jaishankar said, ""I also read that another arrest has been made. If that person is an Indian national, then usually by consular practice, you inform the government or the embassy of the country of origin. But beyond that, we have long maintained that if anything, any event in Canada, any violence in Canada, has any evidence or information which is relevant to be investigated in India, we are open to investigating it.""He emphasised that while any Indian national's arrest would usually prompt notification to the government or embassy, no specific evidence justifying investigation by Indian agencies has been received to date.""But to date, we have never received anything, which is specific and worthy of being pursued by our investigative agencies. And I'm not aware anything has changed in the last few days in that regard,"" the External Affairs Minister said at a media interaction at a seminar on Indian Capital Markets 'Roadmap for Viksit Bharat' at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in Mumbai earlier.At a weekly media briefing, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), too, informed that Canada had not formally conveyed the arrests and India had not yet received any consular access request.On being asked about the fourth Indian arrested by Canada in connection with the Nijjar killing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, ""We have seen reports of the fourth person being arrested. We have not been formally conveyed of it. So far, we have not received any consular access request as well.""Earlier, campaigning for the ongoing general elections in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a telling remark vis-a-vis its western neighbour, saying India does not send dossiers on terrorism anymore but eliminates terrorists in their own backyard.""Today, India doesn't send dossiers.(Today India strikes back at terrorists on their own turf),"" PM Modi said at a poll rally in Maharashtra's Latur.Expanding on the difference in how his government tackles terrorism as compared to previous Congress regimes at the Centre, Prime Minister Modi said the earlier approach of handing dossiers to Pakistan has been replaced by taking out the wanted terror conspirators on their own turf.At a separate rally, PM Modi doubled down on remarks made by the INDIA bloc leader Farooq Abdullah that Pakistan was not wearing bangles and was a nuclear-amed nation, saying, """" (I was told Pakistanis don't even have bangles, we will make them wear some)"".Addressing a public meeting in Muzaffarpur, PM Modi said, ""These (Congress and INDIA alliance) people are so afraid that they see Pakistan's atom bombs even in their dreams. Can such a government and leader run the country? They (INDI alliance leaders) say, ''. (i am told Pakistanis don't even have bangles...we will make them wear some. They are desperately crying out for wheat, they don't have electricity and now they don't even have bangles to wear.) Some leaders in the Opposition are even giving clean chits to the 26/11 accused.""""Some people are doubting the surgical strikes and air strikes (after the Uri and Pulwama terror attacks). These leaders want to weaken the morale of our forces and cast aspersions on our nuclear power. It seems like 'INDI alliance ne India ke khilaf supari le li hai' (INDI partners have taken out a contract against the country),"" PM Modi added.In the US, federal prosecutors earlier alleged the involvement of two Indian nationals, including a government employee, in a plot to murder Khalistani separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Canadian also holding American citizenship, on its soil.According to the indictment of the US Justice Department, an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, who is currently in custody, was charged with the murder-for-hire of Pannun. The US Justice Department claimed that an Indian government employee, who was not identified in the indictment filed, recruited Gupta to hire a hitman to allegedly assassinate Pannun, which was foiled by US authorities.India set up a high-level committee to probe the matter.","Pakistan's Permanent Ambassador to the United Nations, Munir Akram said, invoking the alleged targeted and extra-judicial assassinations in his homeland and elsewhere.

Chief Justice of the IHC, Justice Aamer Farooq, presided over the hearing.PTI district president Aamir Mughal approached the IHC through his counsel and PTI leader Sher Afzal Marwat.

Coated head to toe in eye-catching gold paint, they stood perfectly still, leaning on glimmering canes and tipping their top hats open. Perhaps in a different place, the emergence of mimes on the street looking to earn a few dollars might go unnoticed.But this is Pakistan , where things under the security state often are not as simple as they seem. So as the number of golden performers grew, so, too, did the intrigue around them. Could they be informants for the nation's intelligence agency? Lookouts for powerful politicians? Maybe spies for CIA ?Today, the ""golden men"" of Islamabad have been added to the ranks of the conspiracy theories sprouted, knocked down and rehashed every day across the city. In Pakistan, where the hand of the security services is seen everywhere, conspiracy theories have been embraced in the mainstream for decades. Suspicion has become so universal that wild tales take root after almost every news event. In the wake of catastrophic floods in 2010, people asserted that they had been caused by CIA weather-controlling technology. Media pundits claimed that a US ""thinktank"" was behind a failed car bombing by a Pakistani-American in Times Square that year and that Osama bin Laden was actually Jewish.In such a climate, everyone - even street performers - can be seen as potential tools of the state. For most of Pakistan's 76-year history, the surveillance was a routine facet of daily life. But in recent years, frustration with the military's role in politics has exploded. ""With the political atmosphere so polarised, we're becoming more suspicious of being watched or who is listening,"" said Ali Abas, 25, a resident of Islamabad.On the other side of the city, Mustaq Ahmed, 53, stood on a median of a busy intersection. His jacket, pants, walking cane and top hat were all spray-painted gold. Gold makeup was caked onto his face and hand. Ahmed once sold umbrellas, but became ""Golden Thakur"" three years ago after he overheard another golden man saying he made up to Pak Rs 8,000 - or nearly $30 - each day. It was more than five times what Ahmed was taking home. That cash has dwindled recently as the novelty of the golden men has waned, he said. When asked if he would ever supplement his income with a little side work for the intelligence agencies, he immediately replied: ""no, no, no."" Was there any chance that other golden men were earning a few extra dollars that way? ""Maybe,"" he said with a shrug. ""It's Pakistan.""","In Pakistan, where the hand of the security services is seen everywhere, conspiracy theories have been embraced in the mainstream for decades.

Fresh corruption allegations levelled against ex-Pak PM Imran Khan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/fresh-corruption-allegations-levelled-against-ex-pak-pm-imran-khan/articleshow/110249925.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's accountability watchdog has levelled fresh corruption allegations against jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , accusing him of ""illegally"" possessing and selling seven high-value watches and 10 other precious gifts linked to the state gift repository when he was in power, media reports said on Sunday. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) launched an inquiry against the 71-year-old Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi over the alleged misuse of the Toshakhana -- the state gift repository, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.The beleaguered former first couple has been convicted in earlier Toshakhana corruption cases as well.In January, Khan and Bushra were sentenced to 14 years in jail each by an accountability court for alleged corruption in state gifts they got from the state repository. The sentence was later suspended by the Islamabad High Court (IHC). The previous Toshakhana graft case was filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in the charges of hiring the sale of state gifts.The NAB investigation centres on the illegal possession and sale of seven high-value watches and 10 other precious gifts, including diamond and gold jewellery, the report said.According to the inquiry, items such as Graff and Rolex watches and diamond jewellery were allegedly sold without being legally owned or deposited in the Toshakhana, as required by law.The Toshakhana is a department under the Cabinet Division that stores gifts given to rulers and government officials by heads of other governments and foreign dignitaries.Under the rules governing Toshakhana - a Persian word meaning ""treasure house"" - government officials can keep gifts by paying a price, but first, the gift should be deposited.The gifts were purchased/retained at ""considerably lower rates"" and were ""routinely sold"" without properly declaring them. The expensive Graff watch set was also allegedly sold without ""retention"", according to the report.The NAB's findings suggest collusion between the buyers of the Graff watches and a private appraiser, who allegedly undervalued the watches by Rs 30 million.The undervaluation, confirmed via an email from Toshakhana, meant that only Rs 20.1 million, or 20 per cent of the watches' actual value of Rs 100.9 million, was deposited into the government treasury, the report said.""During the course of the inquiry, it was revealed that the value of luxury gift items was assessed in an unscrupulous and slipshod manner by a private appraiser [...] was not even an industry expert and did not possess the required experience or expertise to make these assessments,"" Geo News said, citing the report.After the report findings, the accountability watchdog was authorised to conduct further probes against Khan and Bushra. Separate call-up notices had also been served to them, which they have challenged in the IHC.The court will hear Bushra's appeal on June 4 and Khan's appeal on June 24, the report said.The former-cricketer-turned-politician has been lodged at the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi since August last year. Since his removal from power in a no-confidence motion in April 2022, Khan has been convicted in at least four cases, including the cipher (secret diplomatic communication) case.","Pakistan's accountability watchdog accuses Imran Khan of ""illegally"" possessing and selling seven high-value watches and 10 other precious gifts.

The upcoming election in Sri Lanka will have a major impact on the future of the island nation and human rights considerations for years to come, the global rights NGO said in a statement issued at the end of a five-day visit by its Secretary General Agnes Callamard to the country.The presidential election in Sri Lanka is scheduled to take place between mid-September and mid-October.""The visit has provided insights into many challenges that Sri Lanka is confronting 15 years after the end of the war (with the LTTE ),"" the statement said.Callamard visited the northeastern Mullaithvu district on Sunday to commemorate the fallen victims from the Tamil side to mark the 15th anniversary of the end of the final conflict.""A seemingly lack of political will, along with complacency in delivering justice prevents reconciliation,"" the statement said, calling on the international community to work with the island's authorities to secure truth and justice for all victims of the war and the ongoing human rights violations and lay the foundation for a freer and fairer Sri Lanka.Amnesty said during the visit, the focus had been centred on threats to civil society; freedom of expression; the right to peaceful protest; the use of anti-terror laws such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to suppress dissent; harassment; intimidation; surveillance and obstacles to press freedom.It said the new legislation such as the Online Security Act and the proposed non-governmental organisation law are worrying evidence of the dangers faced by civil society in the country.The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) had run a military campaign for a separate Tamil homeland in the northern and eastern provinces of the island nation for nearly 30 years before its collapse in 2009.On May 18, 2009, the Sri Lankan Army declared victory with the discovery of the body of the dreaded LTTE leader Velupillai Prabakaran .Despite the passage of nearly 15 years since the end of the armed conflict and many decades since the earliest waves of enforced disappearances, Sri Lankan authorities are still failing to ensure accountability for these violations. Tamil groups claimed a large number of civilians had perished during the final battle.A report issued by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ( OHCHR ) on Friday said the Sri Lankan government must take meaningful action to determine and disclose the fates and whereabouts of tens of thousands of people who have been subjected to enforced disappearance over the decades and hold those responsible to account.It called for renewed action by Sri Lanka at the domestic level to hold it to account through criminal justice. The report also called for the international community to be engaged with Sri Lanka for investigation and prosecutions for targeted sanctions.Sri Lanka maintains that OHCHR is not mandated by the member states to issue any such report.","There is seemingly a ""lack of political will"" in delivering justice to the many victims of Sri Lanka's three-decade-long internal armed conflict, Amnesty International says.

A powerful armed ethnic group in Myanmar said on Sunday it had won control over a town in the western state of Rakhine after weeks of fighting, denying accusations it had targeted members of the Muslim-minority Rohingya during the offensive.Khine Thu Kha, a spokesman for the Arakan Army (AA), said its soldiers had taken Buthidaung near Myanmar's border with Bangladesh, marking another battlefield defeat for the ruling junta that is fighting opposition groups on multiple fronts.""We have conquered all the bases in Buthidaung and also took over the town yesterday,"" Khine Thu Kha told Reuters by telephone.Some Rohingya activists accuse the AA of targeting the community during the assault on Buthidaung and surrounding areas, forcing many of them to flee for safety.""AA troops came into downtown, forced the people to leave their homes and started torching houses,"" Nay San Lwin, co-founder of the Free Rohingya Coalition advocacy group told Reuters, based on what he said were eyewitness accounts.""While the town was burning, I spoke with several people I have known and trusted for years.

LONDON: A former British marine charged with spying for Hong Kong's intelligence service has died, according to a police statement released Tuesday. The man, identified as Matthew Trickett , was found dead in a park in Maidenhead , a town west of London, on Sunday. Trickett was one of three men charged last week under Britain's National Security Act with assisting the Hong Kong intelligence service , and their case was expected to return to court Friday.Hong Kong is a former British colony and a special administrative region of China, and tensions between London and Beijing have been ratcheting up in recent months as the British govt has become increasingly vocal over allegations of Chinese espionage. In the wake of the charges last week, Britain summoned the Chinese ambassador for a reprimand.Trickett, 37, who was a British immigration enforcement officer and a former royal marine, was also director of a private security firm.According to police, a member of the public alerted authorities to a situation in Grenfell Park. Trickett, who was from the area, was found and, despite efforts of emergency responders, was pronounced dead at the site.

In a short video, Zhang said she was taken by police to her brother’s home on May 13, the day she finished her sentence. “I want to thank everyone for their help and concern,” she is heard saying in a soft voice.

The meeting was proposed to take place at a royal residence, but Prince Harry declined because the location did not meet his security requirements .According to daily Mail sources, the Duke of Sussex was in London for a brief visit and had been offered the opportunity to stay at a royal property.However, Harry is said to have refused this invitation because it did not include the level of security he deemed necessary. ""Harry is concerned about staying in a visible location with a public entrance and exit without the proper security measures,"" one source explained.As per the Daily Mail report, the security issue has been a longstanding concern for Prince Harry since he stepped back from royal duties in 2020. His decision to relocate to the United States with his wife, Meghan Markle, and their children was partly influenced by the lack of sufficient security arrangements provided by the royal institution. ""The safety of my family is my priority, and the current setup does not ensure that,"" Harry has stated in previous discussions about his security needs.This incident highlights the ongoing tensions between Prince Harry and the royal family regarding security provisions. Despite being a high-profile figure, Harry's status has changed since he stepped down as a senior royal, complicating the security arrangements typically provided to members of the royal family.King Charles, who has recently ascended to the throne, had extended the invitation in what some insiders saw as an olive branch, hoping to mend the strained relationship with his son. However, the refusal underscores the challenges in reconciling these familial ties amidst security and logistical concerns.The royal family has not officially commented on the matter, but sources close to the palace suggest that the king is disappointed by the outcome. The situation remains delicate, with both sides needing to navigate the complex intersection of personal relationships and public duties.As this story develops, it continues to draw significant public and media attention, highlighting the ongoing challenges faced by the royal family in balancing tradition, security, and the personal lives of its members.",Duke of Sussex was in London for a brief visit and had been offered the opportunity to stay at a royal property.
