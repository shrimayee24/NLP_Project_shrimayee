She added.Soon, Musk reacted to Chaturvedi's post and said ""True.""Meanwhile, British Indians and other South Asian communities in the UK are voicing growing frustration with UK PM Starmer. The recent use of the term ""Asian grooming gangs"" has sparked outrage, with community leaders accusing him of unfairly implicating diverse Asian ethnicities in crimes predominantly committed by individuals of Pakistani heritage.This controversy follows last year’s backlash over Starmer’s culturally insensitive Diwali reception at Downing Street, where alcohol and meat were served, further alienating British Hindus.The term “Asian grooming gangs” came under scrutiny again after Starmer used it while defending his record as Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) from 2008 to 2013.This also followed sharp criticism from billionaire Elon Musk, who accused Starmer of failing to address systemic issues related to grooming gangs during his tenure.British Indian and Sikh leaders argue that such terminology unfairly stigmatizes entire Asian communities, including Indians, Sri Lankans, and others, for crimes predominantly linked to men of Pakistani heritage. “We are dismayed that the PM chose to whitewash this heinous atrocity with the word ‘Asian,’” said Krishna Bhan, Chair of the Hindu Council UK. “Our Hindu and Sikh girls were also victims of these grooming gangs, and using this vague term insults all Asians.”",Tech billionaire Elon Musk seconded Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi after she objected UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer for using the generic term 'Asian' with reference to child sexual abuse scandal across different parts of England.

BENGALURU: The two Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) satellites that Isro was hoping to unite early Thursday have drifted too far apart late Wednesday, causing a second postponement of the final procedure in three days.“While making a maneuver to reach 225m between satellites the drift was found to be more than expected, post non-visibility period. The planned docking for tomorrow (January 9) is postponed. Satellites are safe,” Isro said around 9pm Wednesday.The space agency had initiated the drift on the chaser spacecraft — the two satellites are designated chaser and target — at about 8:05pm.After the launch on December 30, Isro has been preparing for the docking, which requires multiple steps/stages, each of which was monitored from the ground and given a go-ahead before proceeding to the next.On January 6, a day before the first docking attempt was scheduled, Isro had found that the docking process requires further validation through ground simulations based on an abort scenario it identified on the day. And the docking was rescheduled for January 9.Docking in space is a complex process and so far, only three other countries — the US, Russia and China — have mastered it.","The two Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) satellites that Isro was hoping to unite early Thursday have drifted too far apart.

Bombay HC: Can't a woman with 'intellect deficit' be mom?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bombay-hc-cant-a-woman-with-intellect-deficit-be-mom/articleshow/117065502.cms,"Representative image/AI generated

MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Wednesday questioned why a young woman into her 21st week of pregnancy who has been diagnosed with borderline ""intellect deficit"" should have no right to motherhood.A HC-appointed medical board had found the woman only with an intellect deficit, but not of unsound mind. A division bench of Justices R V Ghuge and Rajesh Patil noted that the report submitted Wednesday only indicated that the 27-year-old woman had a borderline case of intellectual disability . Her IQ is 75, and the report found no foetal anomalies either.""Nobody can be super-intelligent. We are all human beings, and everybody has different levels of intelligence,"" the court remarked, adding that merely being of less-than-average intelligence does not mean she has no right to be a mother. ""If we say that persons with below-average intelligence do not have the right to be parents, it would be against the law.""The woman's father petitioned HC for permission to terminate her pregnancy on the ground that she was mentally unsound and unmarried. The woman declined to give her consent for the MTP and wanted to continue with her pregnancy. HC, on Jan 3, after hearing his lawyer SK Dubey and additional govt pleader Prachi Tatake, called for a medical board of the J J Hospital to examine her foetus, and submit its report.The medical board found her fit to continue her pregnancy but said MTP was also possible. Tatake cited several judgments, including one by Justice Bhushan Gavai of Supreme Court, stating that the woman's consent was important and that the foetus in the womb now also had fundamental rights. Under the law, if a woman is of unsound mind for pregnancies beyond 20 weeks, MTP could be considered, but here it was a ""borderline case,"" HC said, calling for her parents to try and reach out to the man she had a relationship with to see if they could marry.""They are both adults. It is not an offence,"" the court said. The woman is an adopted child , and HC stated that as parents, they have a duty to look after her interests."," Bombay high court questions why a young woman into her 21st week of pregnancy should have no right to motherhood.

He described the occupation of Hindu religious sites for mosque construction as a ""wound that needed surgery"", warning that neglect could let it turn into ""cancer"".The survey of the 16th-century mosque in November led to violent clashes in Sambhal. Five people were killed and about 20 security personnel were wounded.""I am not against any religion and respect a place where prayers have been taking place for long. But if a community's site for prayers is broken down, it should be strongly criticised. See how Sambhal has been Islamised. All signs of our religion have been destroyed, covered, and concretised. Continuous riots took place there before 2017...,"" Yogi said.Highlighting the historical significance of Sanatan Dharma, Yogi claimed it as the world's oldest faith, referencing ancient Hindu scriptures. He pointed out that Hindu literature, written thousands of years ago, mentioned the future appearance of Vishnu's tenth avatar Kalki.Yogi referred to historical texts like the Ain-i-Akbar, asserting that a Kalki temple in Sambhal was replaced by a mosque under Mughal emperor Akbar's rule. ""I'm talking of our history which is older than 5,000 years and they don't even have a history of more than 500 years,"" he said.The CM also criticised the Waqf Board , branding it as a ""Board of Mafia"" and pledging to reclaim every inch of illegally occupied land for public welfare projects. He said this in response to controversy over claims that part of the Maha Kumbh area in Prayagraj was Waqf land.Yogi lauded the Maha Kumbh as a symbol of Hindu and national unity, transcending caste and regional differences. He called on political opponents to embrace the spiritual heritage of India, criticising them for not visiting the Ram temple and accusing Congress of altering the Constitution during the Emergency by adding ""socialist"" and ""secular"" to the Preamble.""Babua of Samajwadi Party (Akhilesh Yadav) does politics in the name of Ram Manohar Lohia, but doesn't know what Lohia stood for.

A stampede claimed the lives of six devotees and left over 30 injured during the issuance of Vaikuntha Dwara Sarva Darshan tokens for Lord Venkateswara temple in Tirupati Wednesday evening.The chaos erupted around 8pm when Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams officials began distributing tokens at various centres, including Vishnu Nivasam, Srinivasam and Padmavati Park. The stampede occurred at two locations as the gates were opened to allow an unwell devotee to exit the queue. Devotees, many of whom had been waiting since early morning, surged forward, resulting in severe overcrowding and disorder.Mallika, a devotee from Salem in Tamil Nadu, died of her injuries while being transported to Ruia Hospital in the temple town. Three others died during treatment at Ruia Hospital, and two more passed away at SVIMS. Authorities fear the toll may rise as some of the injuries are critical.Witnesses reported inadequate crowd management. “Even four police personnel were not present when the gate was opened. Thousands of people waiting for hours rushed to collect the tokens,” a survivor said. Another devotee at Padmavati Park criticised the token distribution process: “This tragedy could have been avoided had the system followed after the Covid years been in place.”Vaikuntha Dwara Sarva Darshan is a major event for devotees, offering a special darshan believed to grant a glimpse of the divine gates of heaven (Vaikuntha). The event draws lakhs of devotees, particularly during Vaikuntha Ekadashi festival, when crowds can peak at over 2-3 lakh. TTD had planned to distribute tokens through 94 counters across nine centres for Vaikuntha Dwara Sarva Darshan, scheduled for Jan 10, 11 and 12. However, the sudden influx of devotees overwhelmed the system.Andhra CM Naidu expressed shock over the tragedy and said he was in constant communication with district and TTD officials.

Desperation in the flames

Royal refuge under threat

The air in Southern California crackled with tension as ferocious wildfires, fueled by hurricane-strength winds, ripped through neighborhoods once synonymous with serenity and luxury. Among those in peril: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle , whose $29 million Montecito mansion now teeters on the edge of disaster, reported the New York Post.Southern California Edison (SCE) issued grim warnings of potential "" Public Safety Power Shutoffs ,"" leaving the Duke and Duchess of Sussex anxiously awaiting news of their sprawling 18,000-square-foot haven, where they reside with their children, Prince Archie, 5, and Princess Lilibet, 3. The idyllic escape they built over four years ago is now engulfed in uncertainty.The chaos doesn't stop there. Vice President Kamala Harris, whose Los Angeles neighborhood fell under an evacuation order Wednesday night, narrowly avoided catastrophe. Her official residence, empty at the time, now stands as a silent witness to the inferno’s relentless march.The blaze closest to the Sussexes' home rages in Malibu, roughly 70 miles away — a seemingly safe distance, until winds exceeding 100 miles per hour began to hurl embers across highways and ignite new fronts. Nearly 70,000 Southern California Edison customers were without power Wednesday morning, with an additional 42,000 outages scheduled. Emergency responders were further hamstrung by bone-dry hydrants, turning an already impossible fight into a nightmare.The chaos on the ground is palpable. Tens of thousands have fled their homes, many abandoning vehicles as gridlocked traffic renders escape by car futile. Families, celebrities, and local residents alike have been forced to make the harrowing decision to leave everything behind, carrying only what they can hold as they flee on foot.As the threat inches closer to Montecito, Harry and Meghan may soon face evacuation orders . Their neighborhood, perched precariously in a ""high fire risk"" area, is no stranger to nature’s wrath. The couple's $14.65 million purchase in 2020 was met with admiration for its modern design and lavish amenities — but even such opulence offers little protection from the ferocity of nature.For now, Montecito holds its breath. Helicopters thunder overhead, dropping water on roaring flames, while families across the region grapple with a singular question: Will their home still stand when the smoke clears?With bone-dry conditions, chaotic evacuations, and the ever-present hum of uncertainty, the Sussexes — like so many others — face a terrifying reality: no title, fame, or fortune can shield them from the fires of California.","Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's $29 million Montecito mansion now teeters on the edge of disaster.

Elon Musk’s counterarguments



A British minister has publicly criticized Elon Musk for his remarks on child sexual abuse scandals in the UK, accusing the tech billionaire of lacking knowledge on the issue. Musk, a vocal supporter of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, has used his social media platform, X (formerly Twitter), to target UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips . As per Reuters, he has accused Starmer of failing to prosecute grooming gangs during his tenure as director of public prosecutions and referred to Phillips as a "" rape genocide apologist ."" The controversy has sparked widespread debate, with both praise and condemnation for Musk’s comments.Elon Musk’s social media posts allege that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer was complicit in failing to prosecute gangs of men accused of sexually abusing young girls during his time as director of public prosecutions from 2008 to 2013. Musk accused Starmer of prioritizing political gains over justice for victims, stating that an inquiry would reveal his ""deep complicity in the mass rapes in exchange for votes.""Musk also directed harsh criticism at Jess Phillips, labeling her a ""rape genocide apologist"" and calling for her imprisonment. Phillips, known for her career advocating for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking, dismissed Musk’s comments as baseless and damaging.In an interview with ITV, Jess Phillips described Musk’s remarks as ""ridiculous"" and said they had disrupted her personal and professional life. She expressed frustration that Musk’s comments distracted from her work combating child exploitation. “It’s not great, and the thing that annoys me the most about it is that it takes so much bandwidth of my time from a man who knows absolutely nothing about the subject he is talking about,” Phillips said.According to Reuters, Phillips also shared her pain at seeing child abuse issues turned into a “political football.” She emphasized her dedication to fighting child exploitation and expressed disappointment at the politicization of such a grave subject.The grooming gang scandals referenced by Musk involve the long-term, widespread sexual abuse of young girls in several northern English towns, including Rotherham, Rochdale, and Oldham. Investigations revealed that gangs, primarily of South Asian origin, exploited vulnerable girls over several years.In 2022, a nationwide inquiry into child sexual abuse in the UK, including cases within institutions such as schools and churches, concluded with numerous recommendations. However, some of these recommendations have yet to be implemented, prompting ongoing calls for action.Musk and other opposition figures have called for a new national inquiry, despite previous extensive investigations. Jess Phillips has advocated for localized inquiries by councils in affected towns but has faced criticism from Musk and his supporters for her stance.The heated discourse has led to tangible security threats. Sky News reported that a man was charged with three counts of malicious communication, following threats made towards Jess Phillips. While Devon and Cornwall Police did not name the victims, the charges underscore the potential dangers of inflammatory rhetoric.Phillips revealed the emotional toll such threats take, noting how divisive comments detract from meaningful efforts to address child exploitation.Prime Minister Keir Starmer responded to Musk’s accusations by defending his record as director of public prosecutions. Speaking to reporters, he stated, “Those spreading lies and misinformation...are not interested in victims, they are interested in themselves.”Starmer also warned of the harmful consequences of such rhetoric, highlighting its potential to incite threats and intimidation against public figures. He accused Musk and others of amplifying falsehoods for personal or political gain.In response to the backlash, Elon Musk doubled down on his claims, reiterating his call for an inquiry into the grooming gang scandals. Musk argued that Starmer’s leadership and the actions of other officials during the period in question warrant deeper scrutiny.Despite the criticism, Musk remains a polarizing figure, with some supporters echoing his calls for greater accountability and others condemning his inflammatory language.","Elon Musk has criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips.

California Governor Gavin Newsom is facing harsh criticism after posting an Instagram Story showing him at the scene of the devastating Palisades Fire , which has displaced thousands in Los Angeles County. Accusations of using the tragedy for a ""photo op"" have sparked backlash from conservatives and political opponents alike.The controversial ""Libs of TikTok"" account led the charge, writing, ""Gavin Newsom has arrived for the photo op of him watching his state burn to the ground."" Popular conservative account Breaking 911 joined in, posting, ""JUST IN: California Gov.

Our deepest thanks go to our expert firefighters and first responders.""However, his critics remained unmoved. Trump's post further echoed past remarks, including a 2018 threat to withhold federal funding unless California improved its forest management. At the time, Trump declared, ""There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor.""Newsom and Democrats continue to attribute California’s wildfires to climate change , with Newsom previously dismissing Trump’s attacks, saying in 2019, ""You don’t believe in climate change.

""Workers and communities in both our countries benefit from being each other's biggest trading and security partner,"" Trudeau said.Foreign minister Melanie Joly accused Trump of ""a complete lack of understanding"" of Canada. ""Our economy is strong. Our people are strong.

PARIS: French far-right leader Marine Le Pen paid tribute Wednesday to her father Jean-Marie, calling the founder of the National Front , who has died aged 96, a ""warrior"" in politics as their relationship was marked by notoriously harsh disputes amid her efforts to make the party more mainstream.In a post on social media platform X, Le Pen wrote: ""A venerable age had taken the warrior away but given us back our father,"" suggesting she was able to reconcile with him.Jean-Marie, who has three daughters, including Marine, the youngest, was a polarizing figure, convicted multiple times of antisemitism, discrimination and inciting racial violence.""Many people he loved are waiting for him up there. Many who love him mourn him here below,"" Le Pen wrote. ""Fair winds and following seas, Papa!""Jean-Marie Le Pen 's death was announced on Tuesday when his daughter was on her way back from the French territory of Mayotte, in the Indian Ocean, which was hit by a devastating cyclone in December.Marine Le Pen's legal issues Marine Le Pen is widely considered as one of France's top contenders for the next presidential election scheduled in 2027. She was runner-up to President Emmanuel Macron twice in previous elections.Yet her political future in part depends on the verdict to be rendered by a Paris court on March 31 over charges of embezzlement of European Parliament Funds. The court could declare her ineligible to seek public office if she was to be found guilty.Le Pen and other party officials are accused of having used money intended for European Union parliamentary aides to pay instead staff who worked for the party between 2004 and 2016, violating the 27-nation bloc's regulations.Anti-far right gatherings Thousands of demonstrators gathered on the Republic Plaza in Paris on Tuesday evening to celebrate the death of the far-right politician. The crowd could be seen dancing and chanting: ""Happy New Year, Jean-Marie is dead.""Similar gatherings took place in other French cities, including Lyon and Marseille.French anti-racist group SOS Racisme said Jean-Marie Le Pen spent his life promoting the far right through ""racism, xenophobia, antisemitism and Holocaust denial."" The group also paid tribute in a statement to ""generations of activists who have given their time, youth and energy to fight the National Front and its ideas.""Father-daughter public disputes In an interview in 1987, Jean-Marie referred to the Nazi gas chambers as a ""detail in World War II history.""He repeated the remark in 2015, saying he ""did not at all"" regret it, triggering the ire of his daughter, by then the party leader, seeking to distance herself from her father's extremist image. That year, he was kicked out of the party, later renamed the National Rally, as part of the younger Le Pen's efforts to transform it into one of France's most powerful political forces.At the time, Jean-Marie publicly denounced a ""felony"" and asked his daughter to ""give back her name,"" arguing she should not use ""Le Pen"" anymore. He also launched legal proceedings to challenge his exclusion that ultimately failed.""I had such profound disagreements on that topic with my own father that I had to exclude him from the movement,"" Marine Le Pen told BFM television in May 2024.

A state of emergency was declared by California governor Gavin Newsom as wildfires raged across Los Angeles.The towering blazes ignited on Tuesday and were driven by winds gusting up to 70 mph (112 kph) in certain areas, creating an inferno that firefighters struggled to contain. For a time, the winds rendered aerial firefighting efforts too dangerous. By Wednesday morning, however, firefighting aircraft resumed operations, dropping water and retardants over the flames.Governor Gavin Newsom reported that more than 1,400 firefighters have been deployed to combat the fires, with additional support coming from Oregon, which has dispatched 240 firefighters and 60 engines. The Los Angeles Fire Department issued an extraordinary call for all off-duty personnel to join the fight.Preliminary estimates by AccuWeather place the damage and economic losses from these fires between $52 billion and $57 billion.

Who is Doug Ford? Canadian official laughs off Trump’s Canada takeover idea: 'How about we buy two American states?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-doug-ford-canadian-official-laughs-off-trumps-canada-takeover-idea-how-about-we-buy-two-american-states/articleshow/117057599.cms,"Ford’s remarks were in response to Trump’s renewed push for unification with Canada.

Ford’s fiery history of defiance

Trudeau’s take: A snowball’s chance in hell

Trump’s grand vision

Ontario Premier Doug Ford has never been one to shy away from a confrontation, but his latest sparring match with former US President Donald Trump has taken the Canada-US dynamic into uncharted territory. At a press conference on Monday, Ford fired back at Trump’s provocative suggestion that Canada should become the 51st state, offering a counterproposal that caught everyone off guard.“To the president, I’ll make him a counteroffer,” Ford said, visibly irritated by the question. “How about if we buy Alaska? And we’ll throw in Minnesota and Minneapolis at the same time? You know, it’s not realistic.”Ford’s remarks were in response to Trump’s renewed push for unification with Canada, which the former president claimed would benefit both nations economically and militarily. Ford, however, was having none of it.“He may be joking, but under my watch, that will never, ever happen,” Ford declared, emphasizing his commitment to protecting Canadian sovereignty .This isn’t the first time Ford has locked horns with Trump. In 2024, the Ontario Premier threatened to cut off electricity exports to over a million Americans and ban American-made beer in retaliation for Trump’s proposed 25% tariffs on Canadian goods.“If they come at us, we have to stand up for Canadians,” Ford said at the time. “It would cut off the lights to a million-and-a-half Americans.”Canada is the largest exporter of energy to the US, with states like Michigan and New York heavily reliant on Ontario’s electricity. Ford’s bold threats underscored the delicate interdependence between the two nations.Outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also weighed in on Trump’s 51st state proposal. In a fiery post on X (formerly Twitter), Trudeau dismissed the idea outright:“There isn’t a snowball’s chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States,” he wrote. “Workers and communities in both our countries benefit from being each other’s biggest trading and security partner.”Trudeau’s rebuttal came as Trump ramped up his rhetoric on Truth Social, claiming that many Canadians “LOVE being the 51st state” and that merging the two nations would eliminate tariffs and bolster security against Russia and China.Trump’s ambitions don’t stop at Canada. The president-elect has also revived his interest in purchasing Greenland, a move he first floated during his previous term. On Monday, he posted a meme on Truth Social showing a map of North America with both Canada and Greenland covered in the American flag, captioned “Oh, Canada!”“We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside World. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!” Trump proclaimed, while his son, Donald Trump Jr., toured Greenland wearing a MAGA hat.","Ontario Premier Doug Ford has never been one to shy away from a confrontation, but his latest sparring match with former US President Donald Trump has taken the Canada-US dynamic into uncharted territory.

Elon Musk brutally trolls Canada's Justin Trudeau after fiery exchange over Trump's 51st state idea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-calls-justin-trudeau-a-girl-amid-fiery-exchange-over-trumps-canada-takeover-idea/articleshow/117055803.cms,"Musk, never one to hold back, mocked Trudeau’s statement.

In a war of words, Elon Musk took a swipe at Justin Trudeau on Wednesday, belittling the Canadian Prime Minister by calling him a “girl” and dismissing his authority with the jab, “You’re not the governor of Canada anymore.” This came after Trudeau publicly rejected Donald Trump’s provocative suggestion that the United States could take over Canada.Trudeau, who announced his resignation as Prime Minister earlier this week amid plummeting popularity, fiercely rebuffed Trump’s idea. “There isn’t a snowball’s chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States,” Trudeau declared in a fiery post on X (formerly Twitter), emphasizing the mutual benefits of Canada-US trade and security partnerships.Musk, never one to hold back, mocked Trudeau’s statement. “Girl, you’re not the governor of Canada anymore, so doesn’t matter what you say,” the Tesla CEO retorted, triggering an avalanche of reactions on social media.Meanwhile, Trump doubled down on his controversial remarks, saying at Mar-a-Lago that Canada joining the US would be “something really special.” The President-elect dismissed the idea of military force, saying, “No, economic force,” while hinting at a 25% tariff on Canadian imports as leverage. Trump has repeatedly called the Canada-US border an “artificially drawn line” and referred to Trudeau as the “governor of Canada.”Adding fuel to the fire, Musk praised the dramatic political shifts of 2025 in another X post, celebrating what he called the return of “great men.” Highlighting Trudeau’s resignation, he wrote, “Trump won. Trudeau resigned. Masculinity is back. Great men are ascendant. And just in time. We’re going to need them.”Trudeau’s decision to step down follows growing dissent within his own Liberal Party amid a struggling economy and bleak approval ratings. With Canada’s next federal election looming by October 20, polls predict a landslide victory for the Conservatives, signaling a seismic political shift in the Great White North.","Elon Musk took a swipe at Justin Trudeau on Wednesday, belittling the Canadian Prime Minister.

Musk’s support: A call for justice

In a fiery exchange that dominated the first PMQs of 2025, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch took aim at Prime Minister Keir Starmer over his refusal to launch a national inquiry into the grooming gangs scandal . The showdown saw Badenoch accusing Starmer of brushing aside the issue of accountability, as she called for a fresh investigation into the systematic abuse, supported by an unexpected ally—Elon Musk.Badenoch opened her line of questioning with a scathing remark about the ""decades-long rape gangs scandal"" that continues to haunt communities across the UK. “There are thousands of victims, but no one has joined the dots or has the total picture. It is almost certainly still going on,” she said, demanding answers from the PM about whether the ""full extent"" of the gangs’ activity had been uncovered.Starmer, however, took a defensive stance, citing numerous local and national inquiries that have already been conducted. He stressed the need for action based on the information already gathered, rather than prolonging investigations further. “What is needed now is action on what we already know,” Starmer said. But Badenoch wasn’t backing down.“The problem,” she shot back, “is that these previous inquiries have not held anyone accountable in a meaningful way. One victim from Telford said she wants a national inquiry because it will hold people accountable in a way that previous inquiries have not.” Her words rang with urgency, a demand for justice that could no longer be ignored.Badenoch’s challenge became more pointed as she pressed Starmer: “The PM called for nine inquiries in the last Parliament. Does he not see that by resisting this one, people will start to worry about a cover-up?” Starmer, unfazed, accused Badenoch of “jumping on the bandwagon,” claiming she had never raised the issue when she was in power as children’s minister and women’s equalities minister.Badenoch responded sharply, declaring, “Be a leader, not a lawyer.” She reminded Starmer that the focus must be on the victims, not political maneuvering. “This is not about you, Starmer, or your past work with the Crown Prosecution Service. It’s about the victims, the children who have suffered in silence.”At one point, Starmer attempted to deflect, stating that another lengthy inquiry would delay justice until 2031, but Badenoch was having none of it. “Shorter inquiries are possible. We don’t need to repeat what has already been done,” she argued, emphasizing that the national inquiry should address the racial and cultural motivations behind the abuse, which has often been downplayed.The two leaders clashed once more over past government actions, with Badenoch calling out Starmer’s dismissal of the Conservatives’ work. “He knows full well we accepted 18 of the 20 recommendations in the Jay Inquiry and went further, launching a gangs taskforce,” she retorted. Despite this, Starmer accused the Tories of failing to act on those very recommendations, insisting his party had been “acting” while the Conservatives merely “tweeted and talked.”The tension reached a boiling point when Badenoch demanded: “How are MPs going to explain to their constituents that obeying the whip is more important than doing the right thing?” Starmer, stung by her words, snapped back, accusing the Tories of “bandwagon-jumping” and labeling their approach “misguided” and “short-sighted.”Amidst the back-and-forth, an unlikely figure weighed in on the debate. Elon Musk, the billionaire tech mogul and owner of X, backed Badenoch’s call for action, using his platform to draw attention to the scandal. “Please call your member of parliament and tell them that the hundreds of thousands of little girls in Britain who were, and are still being systematically, horrifically gang-raped deserve some justice in this world,” Musk wrote in a post that quickly gained traction.“This is vitally important, or it will just keep happening,” Musk added, aligning himself with Badenoch’s stance and bolstering her demand for a national inquiry.","Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch took aim at Prime Minister Keir Starmer over his refusal to launch a national inquiry into the grooming gangs scandal.

At least five people have lost their lives, and thousands have been displaced as wildfires in Los Angeles continue to rage. Additionally, more than 1,000 buildings, including homes, businesses, and landmarks, were destroyed.According to a report by the Associated Press, the fires burned through affluent neighbourhoods such as Pacific Palisades and Calabasas, home to celebrities and multimillion-dollar homes. Entire blocks were levelled, with luxury cars reduced to husks and swimming pools filled with ash. Palisades Village lost major grocery stores, banks, and even a library.The flames spread so rapidly that many people had little time to escape. Police officers took refuge in their patrol cars, while residents of a senior living centre were hurried to safety in wheelchairs and hospital beds, navigating the streets in the foothills northeast of Los Angeles.Hollywood productions have also come to a halt, and landmarks such as the Getty Villa faced significant threats from the advancing flames.The fires, which have consumed over 42 square miles, are among the most destructive in Los Angeles’ history. Pacific Palisades was hit hardest, surpassing the damage caused by the 2008 Sayre fire. Winds reaching 80 mph worsened conditions, briefly grounding firefighting aircraft.California Governor Gavin Newsom deployed over 1,400 firefighters and National Guard troops to combat the wildfires, while President Joe Biden has pledged federal aid to support the response efforts.With climate change fuelling longer fire seasons and stronger winds, officials warned the danger is far from over. Dry winds, including the notorious Santa Anas, have contributed to warmer-than-average temperatures in Southern California, which has not seen more than 0.1 inches (0.25 centimeters) of rain since early May.","The fires, which have consumed over 42 square miles, are among the most destructive in Los Angeles’ history.

THIS IS WHAT JOE BIDEN IS LEAVING ME. THANKS JOE!”The situation in California has grown dire, with firefighters facing severe water shortages as wildfires continue to rage across the state. Across Pacific Palisades and other areas, fire hydrants have run dry, leaving emergency responders unable to access enough water to contain the flames. In many places, water supplies have dwindled, and pressure in hoses has dropped, leaving firefighters desperate for resources.The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a key US government agency responsible for disaster response and recovery, has reportedly been left without adequate funds to prepare for future crises, leaving California ill-prepared to handle the current wildfire situation. Trump claims this will leave him without the necessary financial support when he is inaugurated as the 47th President of the United States on January 20.Earlier, Trump had also slammed California Governor Gavin Newsom, pointing fingers at the state’s lack of preparation for such disasters.In a post on the social media platform Truth Social, he wrote: ""As of this moment, Gavin Newscum and his Los Angeles crew have contained exactly zero percent of the fire. It’s burning at levels even worse than last night. This is not government. I can’t wait until January 20th!""As wildfires burn, the water demand has far exceeded what local municipal systems can provide, leading to a growing public concern over the ability to combat the fires effectively.

What is the case?

'Imran Khan broke all records'

A Pakistani court has postponed the verdict announcement in GBP 190 million Al-Qadir Trust corruption case against former Prime Minister Imran Khan. The verdict is now scheduled for January 13, according to Islamabad accountability court staff.The delay was attributed to Judge Nasir Javed Rana's leave, the court staff said. Both the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) prosecutor and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder's lawyers have been informed about the postponement. This marks the second delay in the case. The verdict, initially reserved on December 18, was first scheduled for December 23The case alleges that Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, received land and billions of rupees from Bahria Town. In exchange, they allegedly legalized £190 million returned to Pakistan by the UK during Khan's tenure in office.In December 2023, the NAB filed a corruption reference against the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, Bushra Bibi, and several others. The investigation focused on the alleged acquisition of hundreds of acres of land for the Al-Qadir University Trust, which reportedly caused a GBP 190 million loss to the national treasury.The charges state that Imran Khan and other accused individuals misappropriated PKR 50 billion (equivalent to GBP 190 million at the time), transferred by the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) to the Pakistani government, ARY News reported.As part of the investigation, NAB filed a corruption reference against Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi, and six others in connection with the Al-Qadir University project, which was initially registered on December 26, 2019.Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif recently reiterated the corruption allegations against Khan in this case. “There has been a lot of corruption in the last 75 years, but Imran Khan broke all records,” Asif said, further alleging that Khan and his associates were heavily involved in corrupt activities.","The verdict is now scheduled for January 13, according to Islamabad accountability court staff.

Does Pakistan minister's comment on Ghazni signal foreign policy shift?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/does-pakistan-ministers-comment-on-ghazni-signal-foreign-policy-shift/articleshow/116973163.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan's old antic to taunt India by naming its missiles after Afghan invaders has taken an unexpected turn in the wake of a new conflict with Afghanistan.The controversy ignited when Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif described Mahmud of Ghazni - a figure celebrated in Pakistan's historical narrative - as ""merely a plunderer"". His remark, delivered during a televised interview, stunned many in a country where school textbooks have long celebrated Mahmud for his raid on the Somnath temple in India in 1026. This dispute put the spotlight on naming of missiles after figures who invaded India to rile the country.Pakistan has named its missiles after Ghazni who raided and destroyed the legendary Shiv Mandir at Somnath, after Ahmad Shah Abdali who won the third battle of Panipat after defeating the Marathas and massacring thousands of them, and after Muhammad Ghori who defeated Prithviraj Chauhan.The choices of invaders from Afghanistan were deliberately meant to not only rile India but also leave no doubt that Pakistan's ballistic missile programme was India-centric, a narrative that resonated domestically, while deflecting international scrutiny.Asif is a hardliner himself. This time, however, he seemed to target a different audience. His comment came amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pakistan recently conducted airstrikes in Afghanistan, claiming it targeted Pakistani Taliban operatives allegedly harboured by the Afghan Taliban. Analysts suggest Asif's critique of Mahmud was less about historical revisionism and more an attempt to antagonize the Afghan Taliban.The Afghan govt promptly denounced Asif's statements as reckless. Within Pakistan, the remarks sparked a polarizing debate. Some welcomed the re-evaluation of Mahmud's legacy, while others, including members of Asif's own political party, rebuked him. Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, a former information minister, urged Asif to consult Romila Thapar's work on Somnath. Thapar, a respected Indian historian, posits that Mahmud's attack was motivated by economic and political factors rather than religious zeal, challenging the colonial-era framing of it as a Hindu-Muslim conflict.As the controversy lingers, it raises a provocative question: If Mahmud of Ghazni is no longer regarded as a hero, should the Ghaznavi missile be renamed? This debate transcends mere symbolism, hinting at broader shifts in Pakistan's foreign policy, historical narratives, and regional positioning, amid growing international and domestic pressures.","Defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif described Mahmud of Ghazni as ""merely a plunderer"" His comment came amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
