"Operation Sindoor: Govt says strike was 'measured, non-escalatory’; ceasefire held after Pakistan reached out",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-govt-says-strike-was-measured-non-escalatory-ceasefire-held-after-pakistan-reached-out/articleshow/122894077.cms,"Kirti Singh (left), parliament (ANI, PTI)

The ministry of external affairs on Thursday informed Parliament that Operation Sindoor was launched in retaliation to ""barbaric"" assault carried out by ""Pakistan-sponsored terrorists,"" and with the aim to destroy terrorist infrastructure and eliminate terrorists who were believed to be preparing to infiltrate into India.Ministry of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh,in a written response to questions asked in Rajya Sabha also said India's actions were ""focussed, measured and non-escalatory"".Samajwadi party MP Ramji Lal Suman, asked the ministry of external affairs whether Operation Sindoor was launched “under international pressure,” and the “factual position” in the same.He also went on to ask about the possible impact on the morale of armed forces in the view of ""sudden announcement of ceasefire in Operation Sindoor,"" while the Indian military was ""achieving significant success"", but suddenly ""declaring ceasefire was against their morale and the sentiments of the people of the country"".Union MOS Singh in his response said, Operation Sindoor was launched to a ""barbaric cross-border terror attack"" by Pakistan-sponsored terrorists. It focussed on dismantling terrorist infrastructure and neutralising terrorists likely to be sent across to India"".He added, although India’s response was “focused, measured, and non-escalatory,”but “Pakistan, however, attempted targeting Indian civilian areas, in addition to some military facilities.""These provocations and escalatory actions by Pakistan were met with a strong and decisive response from the Indian armed forces, inflicting significant damage on the Pakistani military. Subsequently, on 10 May, 2025, the director general of military operations of Pakistan approached his Indian counterpart to request for cessation of firing and military activities, which was agreed to later that day,"" the statement read.As part of Operation Sindoor, India destroyed nine terrorist camps located in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) through precise pre-dawn strikes on May 7. The operation was launched to avenge the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam.In response to a question on whether India had attempted to ""alienate"" Pakistan internationally, the MEA clarified that the selection of chairs and vice-chairs for UN security council bodies is part of its routine annual process.For 2025, Pakistan, along with Russia and France, has been appointed a vice-chair of the UN counter terrorism committee. Singh noted that India had chaired this committee in both 2011-12 and 2022.He stated, ""the government of India has been sensitising all concerned interlocutors on the menace of cross-border terrorism emanating from Pakistan. Due to India’s persistent efforts, the global community has a greater understanding of India’s concerns on cross-border terrorism.""These efforts, he added, have led to the listing of several Pakistan-based terrorists under the UNSC 1267 sanctions committee and contributed to Pakistan’s FATF grey listing. The UNSC also ""strongly condemned"" the Pahalgam terror attack and stressed accountability for its perpetrators.MOS added, several world leaders have backed India’s counter-terrorism efforts post-Pahalgam, with the US recently designating The Resistance Front (TRF), a Lashkar-e-Taiba proxy, as a foreign terrorist organisation.Responding to a separate query about if the government has ""formally raised concerns"" with the US over ongoing military aid and arms supplies to Pakistan that could be ""misused against India"", Singh in a written response said that India had ""formally raised concerns"" with the US over its military aid to Pakistan and monitors all regional security developments closely.He stated, ""India has consistently conveyed its concerns in this regard to the United States, with a view to ensuring that these developments do not compromise India's security or regional stability.""Reiterating India’s stance, he said Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh ""are, have been, and will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India.""On India-US counter-terrorism cooperation, he added, ""counter-terrorism remains a vital pillar of the India-US comprehensive global strategic partnership,"" with both countries working closely on designations, legal assistance, and extraditions.","Ministry of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh said India's actions were ""focussed, measured and non-escalatory"" Samajwadi party MP Ramji Lal Suman asked whether Operation Sindoor was launched “under international pressure,” and the “factual position” in the same.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122894205,imgsize-1429319,width-400,resizemode-4/122894205.jpg"
Jeju Air Crash: Pilots shut off wrong engine; probe finds clear evidence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/jeju-air-crash-pilots-shut-off-wrong-engine-probe-finds-clear-evidence/articleshow/122811341.cms,"



South Korean investigators have found clear evidence that pilots of the Jeju Air plane that crashed in December shut down the wrong engine after a bird strike, a source familiar with the probe said on Monday.The investigation, led by South Korea’s Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB), has found that the left engine, which was less damaged, was shut off instead of the right engine, which had been more seriously affected by the bird strike.The source told Reuters that cockpit voice recordings, computer data, and a physical engine switch recovered from the wreckage support this conclusion.""The investigation team has clear evidence and backup data, so its finding will not change,"" the source said, speaking anonymously as the official report has not yet been released.The Boeing 737-800 aircraft, operating a flight from Bangkok, crashed while attempting to land at Muan Airport on 29 December 2024. Of the 181 people on board, only two survived, making it the deadliest air disaster on South Korean soil.An examination of the recovered engines confirmed there were no defects before the bird strike and the crash, according to a government source.Investigators reportedly shared these findings with the victims' families during a private briefing on Saturday.A third source, who was present at the meeting, said the families were told the right engine had suffered greater damage, but the left, less-damaged, engine was shut down instead.The ARAIB has not officially commented on the findings. Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer, directed queries to ARAIB. Engine manufacturer CFM International, a joint venture between GE and France’s Safran, has not responded to requests for comment.Jeju Air said it is actively cooperating with the investigation and is awaiting the official release of the results.While a preliminary report issued in January confirmed the presence of duck remains in both engines, it did not specify the extent of damage. A scheduled media briefing on Saturday was cancelled after victims’ families objected to the report being made public, saying it unfairly focused on pilot error and failed to consider other factors.The Jeju Air flight overshot the runway during an emergency belly landing and crashed into an embankment containing navigation equipment. The collision caused a fire and a partial explosion, Reuters reported.Victims’ families and the pilots’ union have urged the investigation team to also examine the embankment’s role in the severity of the crash. Aviation experts believe the structure may have contributed to the high death toll.The pilots’ union has criticised ARAIB for “misleading the public” by suggesting there was no problem with the left engine, even though bird remains were found in both engines. The union accused the investigators of making the pilots scapegoats and not providing enough scientific evidence to prove the aircraft could have landed safely with just the left engine running.The union also said the investigation has so far failed to address possible organisational responsibility. A group representing the bereaved families added that the language in the planned press release made it appear as if a final conclusion had already been reached. They have called for all facts surrounding the crash to be fully examined and clarified.Under international aviation rules, a final accident report is expected within a year of the incident.","South Korean investigators have found clear evidence that pilots of the Jeju Air plane that crashed in December shut down the wrong engine after a bird strike.

CHENNAI: Madras high court on Thursday summoned the principal sessions judge of Kallakurichi to explain the grant of anticipatory bail to an accused in an attempt to murder case.Justice P Velmurugan passed the order after HC was informed that the sessions court had granted bail to the accused even before the victim was discharged from hospital, where she was undergoing treatment for injuries suffered during the alleged attack.The issue pertains to a plea moved by S Lakshmi Bala, a resident of Villupuram. She lodged a complaint at the Sankarapuram police station claiming Arivazhagi, the president of S Sellampattu panchayat, along with her husband and others, unlawfully entered her house with the intention of grabbing her land and assaulted her and her son. Since no action was taken on the complaint, Lakshmi moved HC seeking a transfer of the probe to a different agency.When the case came up for hearing in HC, the petitioner's advocate pointed out the prosecutor had previously stated the complainant, who was injured in the assault, was discharged from hospital on July 3. Based on this information, the Kallakurichi principal sessions court granted anticipatory bail to the accused. However, the complainant submitted that she was discharged from hospital only on July 9.The director of prosecution submitted before HC that the prosecution had informed the sessions court that the victim was discharged from hospital on July 3 based on information provided by the investigating officer, a point reiterated by the government prosecutor. Recording the submissions, Justice Velmurugan directed Irusan Poonguzhali, principal sessions judge of Kallakurichi, to appear before HC on July 28 along with relevant documents and provide an explanation about the grant of anticipatory bail to the accused.","Madras high court on Thursday summoned the principal sessions judge of Kallakurichi to explain the grant of anticipatory bail to an accused in an attempt to murder case.

The Central Administrative Tribunal has since stayed the suspensions.DNA's petition alleges that the report was submitted in ""undue haste"", ignoring ""critical documentation"" demonstrating the firm's efforts to manage the event inside the stadium.

Mass displacement and casualties amid cross-border bombardment

Blame game and diplomatic breakdown

International alarm and domestic fallout





A sharp escalation in fighting between Thai and Cambodian forces has killed at least 14 people and displaced over 100,000 civilians, according to Thai authorities.The violence- involving small arms, rockets, artillery, and airstrikes- erupted Thursday and has been escalating along the long-disputed border and continued into Friday, marking the most serious confrontation between the two Southeast Asian neighbours in over a decade, as reported by AP.The Thai Interior Ministry said the fighting had affected four provinces and ordered evacuations of civilians living within 50 kilometres of the border. The interior ministry said that one lakh six hundred seventy-two people from four border provinces were moved to shelters, while the health ministry announced that the death toll rose to fourteen.In Oddar Meanchey province, Cambodian families streamed away from the border, many transporting their belongings on homemade tractors before settling in makeshift camps. “Suddenly I heard a loud noise,” said 45-year-old mother of four, Tep Savouen as quoted by AP. “My son told me it might be thunder and I thought 'Is it thunder or is it loud, more like a gun?' At that time I was very scared.”In Bangkok, Public Health Minister Somsak Thepsuthin confirmed 14 deaths, including 13 civilians and one soldier, along with 46 injuries.He condemned what he described as Cambodian attacks on civilians and a hospital: “We urge the Cambodian government to immediately halt these war criminal actions, and return to respecting the principles of peaceful coexistence.”Read more: Thailand-Cambodia clash intensifies with rocket strikes- What triggered it? How a Hindu temple is at the centre of it The violence followed a landmine blast Wednesday that wounded five Thai soldiers — an incident that triggered the expulsion of ambassadors by both sides and a sharp diplomatic fallout. Thai officials accused Cambodia of laying new Russian-made mines, while Cambodia dismissed the claims as “baseless accusations”, blaming leftover ordnance from past conflicts.On Thursday, clashes flared in at least six areas along the border, including near the ancient Ta Muen Thom temple. Thai F-16 fighter jets conducted airstrikes in response to what the government said were Cambodian truck-mounted rockets. “It was an act of self-defense,” Thai Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nikorndej Balankura stated.Cambodia’s Defense Ministry claimed the airstrikes hit a road near Preah Vihear, a UNESCO World Heritage site, and vowed legal action. “The temple was declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO... and is a ‘historical legacy of the Cambodian people,’” Cambodia’s Culture Ministry said.Defense Ministry spokesperson Lt. Gen. Maly Socheata said Cambodia had “no choice but to defend its territory against Thai threats,” insisting the attacks were “focused on the military places, not on any other place.”The conflict drew swift international concern. UN Secretary-General António Guterres urged both sides “to exercise maximum restraint and address any issues through dialogue,” according to deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet requested an emergency UN Security Council session, which was held behind closed doors in New York on Friday.Thailand sealed all land border crossings and advised its citizens to leave Cambodia. All seven Thai airlines offered to help repatriate Thai nationals.Meanwhile, the conflict has added pressure to Thailand’s domestic politics. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was suspended on July 1 amid an ethics probe linked to her handling of a phone call with Cambodia’s former leader Hun Sen. Thailand’s acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai is now leading the response, warning Cambodia against further aggression.","A sharp escalation in fighting between Thai and Cambodian forces has killed at least 14 people and displaced over 100,000 civilians.

Taylor Swift reportedly “cut” Blake Lively from Selena Gomez’s birthday guest list

Travis Kelce stands by Taylor Swift as her inner circle gets smaller — and more curated

FAQs

1. Why was Blake Lively absent from Selena Gomez’s birthday party?

2. What caused the tension between Taylor Swift and Blake Lively?

3. Was Travis Kelce involved in the situation?

In the ever-evolving web of celebrity friendships, Taylor Swift appears to be making bold choices about who gets to stay in her close circle — and who doesn’t. The latest drama? According to a report from #ShuterScoop, Swift may have been behind Blake Lively’s noticeable absence from Selena Gomez’s glitter-filled birthday party. And while the alleged fallout continues to spark headlines, Swift’s boyfriend, Travis Kelce, reportedly stood by her side during the festivities.A source told #ShuterScoop that Blake Lively was “deliberately cut from the guest list” for Gomez’s 33rd birthday bash — and the reason points directly to Taylor Swift. The insider added that Lively’s ongoing legal drama with her It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni may have become too toxic for Swift to tolerate. The source claimed Gomez simply wanted “love, light, and platform boots” — not “subpoenas and side-eyes” — at her party.That legal entanglement seems to have chilled what was once a beloved Hollywood friendship. While Swift and Lively were often seen together in past years — including red carpets, Met Galas, and girls' nights out — they haven’t been publicly photographed together in months. Lively’s notable absence from the party, and now from Swift’s inner circle, only adds fuel to the speculation.Amid all the noise, Travis Kelce was reportedly enjoying the celebration alongside Swift.

JAIPUR: A major landslide occurred early Wednesday morning near Nari village in the Chirawa region in Rajasthan, after a portion of a hill collapsed with a loud explosion-like sound.No casualties were reported in the incident. However, the incident triggered panic among villagers, who allege illegal and heavy blasting in the area by mining contractors.According to reports, the region had been experiencing intermittent rainfall since Tuesday night.At around 5am on Wednesday, heavy showers resumed. Shortly afterward, villagers noticed unusual movements in a hill near the village.Acting quickly, they moved to a safe distance — moments later, a large section of the hill crumbled with a thunderous noise, sending up a thick cloud of dust and shaking the nearby area.Villagers allege that the hill has been extensively mined in violation of regulations.Some residents claimed that tremors from the landslide were felt in surrounding areas. There are also claims that a nearby government school building has developed cracks, possibly due to the repeated blasting and the recent collapse.Following the incident, Chirawa tehsildar Kamaldeep Poonia visited the site and assessed the situation. He urged villagers to stay clear of the hill and confirmed that a formal report has been prepared and sent to higher authorities.","A major landslide occurred early Wednesday morning near Nari village in the Chirawa region in Rajasthan, after a portion of a hill collapsed with a loud explosion-like sound.

What to know about the man charged with trying to assassinate Trump in Florida,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-to-know-about-the-man-charged-with-trying-to-assassinate-trump-in-florida/articleshow/122894466.cms,"Ryan Wesley Routh takes part in a rally in central Kyiv, Ukraine, April 30, 2022.





A man charged with attempting to assassinate president Donald Trump in South Florida last year was back in court this week, asking a federal judge to let him represent himself, as prosecutors tried to block him from introducing irrelevant evidence during trial.Ryan Routh's court-appointed federal public defenders on Thursday asked to be taken off the case, saying he had refused repeated attempts to meet with their team.Separately, prosecutors trying the case asked a judge ahead of the September trial to rule out the introduction of inadmissible evidence, such as Routh's previous writings, that may unfairly influence jurors. The judge was planning to hear arguments over that matter on Friday.Here's what to know about the case.The judge lets Ryan Routh represent himself US District Judge Aileen Cannon signed off Thursday on Ryan Routh's request to represent himself during his trial but said court-appointed attorneys need to remain as standby counsel.The judge told Routh that she believed it was a bad idea for Routh to represent himself, but he wouldn't be dissuaded. Routh, who has described the extent of his education as two years of college after earning his GED certificate, told Cannon that he understood and would be ready.On Friday, the judge was hearing a motion from prosecutors to limit unrelated evidence at trial. ""As the Court knows, Routh has been very explicit in his desire to turn this trial into a circus where his supposed good character is weighed against the President's,"" the prosecutors wrote.Routh is a self-styled mercenary leader The 59-year-old Routh was a North Carolina construction worker who in recent years had moved to Hawaii. A self-styled mercenary leader, Routh spoke out to anyone who would listen about his dangerous, sometimes violent plans to insert himself into conflicts around the world, witnesses have told The Associated Press.In the early days of the war in Ukraine, Routh tried to recruit soldiers from Afghanistan, Moldova and Taiwan to fight the Russians. In his native Greensboro, North Carolina, he had a 2002 arrest for eluding a traffic stop and barricading himself from officers with a fully automatic machine gun and a ""weapon of mass destruction,"" which turned out to be an explosive with a 10-inch-long fuse.In 2010, police searched a warehouse Routh owned and found more than 100 stolen items, from power tools and building supplies to kayaks and spa tubs. In both felony cases, judges gave Routh either probation or a suspended sentence.Routh is charged with attempted assassination Authorities said Routh tried to assassinate Trump, who was running for his second term last September as the GOP presidential nominee, while he played golf at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida.Routh is facing five felony counts in federal court in Fort Pierce, Florida. They include attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate; possessing a firearm to carry out a violent crime; assaulting a federal officer; felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition; and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.Judge presided over Trump's classified documents case If the judge's name sounds familiar, it's because she presided over another high-profile case involving Trump - the classified documents case.Last year, Cannon sided with Trump's lawyers who said the special counsel who filed the charges was illegally appointed by the US justice department. Cannon's ruling halted a criminal case that at the time it was filed was widely regarded as the most perilous of all the legal threats the president faced before he returned to office last January.Cannon was a former federal prosecutor who was nominated to the bench by Trump in 2020.Trump was not hurt in the incident He was fine, US secret service agents stationed a few holes up from where Trump was playing golf noticed the muzzle of an AK-style rifle sticking through the shrubbery that lines the course, roughly 400 yards away. An agent fired, and the gunman dropped the rifle and fled in an SUV, leaving the firearm behind along with two backpacks, a scope used for aiming and a GoPro camera. He was later stopped by law enforcement in a neighbouring county.Last September's assassination attempt took place just nine weeks after Trump survived another attempt on his life in Pennsylvania.","Ryan Routh's court-appointed federal public defenders on Thursday asked to be taken off the case, saying he had refused repeated attempts to meet with their team.

'Unprecedented'



China looms large







TAIPEI: Taiwan's main opposition will protest Friday ahead of unprecedented recall elections targeting its lawmakers that could tip the balance of power to President Lai Ching-te's party.Supporters of Lai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) are seeking to unseat 31 Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers who they accuse of being pro-China and a threat to national security.The KMT, which advocates closer ties with Beijing, controls parliament with the help of the Taiwan People's Party (TPP) and has slammed the recall effort as undermining the self-ruled island's democracy.Two dozen KMT lawmakers could lose their seats on Saturday in a legal process that allows the public to oust elected officials before the end of their term.Another seven face recall elections on August 23.Started by civic groups this year, the recall campaigns have dominated Taiwanese politics, newspaper headlines and social media feeds for months.The DPP lost its parliamentary majority in the 2024 elections that swept Lai, who is detested by Beijing, to the presidency.Since then, the KMT and TPP have joined forces to stymie Lai's agenda and cut the government's budget.A series of opposition bills, including reforms expanding parliament's powers, sparked brawls in the legislature and massive street protests last year.The DPP needs a minimum of 12 KMT lawmakers to be recalled to give it a ""short-lived legislative majority"", risk analysis firm Eurasia Group said, giving that outcome ""a 60 percent probability"".Lai's party would then need to flip six seats in by-elections later this year to secure control of the 113-seat parliament, which Eurasia Group said would be an ""uphill climb"".If it succeeds, the DPP would likely use its temporary control of the purse strings to reverse the opposition's budget cuts and increase defence spending, analysts said.The scale of the recall campaign was ""unprecedented"" in Taiwan, Dafydd Fell, an expert on Taiwan politics at the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies, told AFP.It reflected the ""strengths of Taiwanese civil society, which has responded to what it perceives as a serious threat to Taiwan's democracy and sovereignty,"" he said.For a KMT lawmaker to lose their seat, the number of votes in favour of recalling them must exceed those against and also be more than 25 percent of the total number of registered voters in the electorate.A KMT bid to have 15 DPP lawmakers recalled failed.With turnout critical, DPP supporters have been standing outside subway stations, in public parks and at food markets for weeks urging people to vote ""yes"".Thousands of people gathered in the rain near the Presidential Office Building on Thursday in a show of support for the recalls.KMT legislators fighting for their political lives have also taken to the streets to persuade voters to oppose the recall.Their supporters are expected to be out in force on Friday night for a final protest before polling stations open.With many recall votes happening in KMT strongholds, Fell said it would be difficult for the DPP to win control of the parliament.""Even if some of the KMT legislators are recalled, other KMT politicians might win the seats back in the resulting by-elections,"" he said.National Taipei University political scientist Liu Chia-wei said the vote had become an ""ideological duel"" between the DPP and KMT, as China loomed large.Taiwan's top policy body on China said this week there was ""visible evidence"" Beijing was trying to ""interfere"" in the election process.China insists Taiwan is part of its territory and has ramped up military and political pressure on the island to press its claim of sovereignty.Lai's government has repeatedly warned of the growing threat from Chinese espionage, disinformation and cyberattacks.Public opinion on the recalls is divided.Aaron Yu, 32, said he supported the campaign because ""most of the bills passed by KMT lawmakers are pro-China"".But restaurant worker Sharon Chen criticised it as a waste of money, saying voters had already made their decisions in last year's elections.""Just because a certain party lost, they can't accept the result and now want to recall someone the people chose, I think that's just senseless,"" the 65-year-old said.","Taiwan's main opposition will protest Friday ahead of recall elections targeting its lawmakers.

Visit turns awkward: Fed Chair Jerome Powell publicly fact-checks Trump on renovation costs; watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/visit-turns-awkward-fed-chair-jerome-powell-publicly-fact-checks-trump-on-renovation-costs-watch/articleshow/122893761.cms,"



Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell fact-checked President Donald Trump in real time during a tour of the Fed’s under-renovation headquarters. Trump claimed the cost of the project had ballooned to $3.1 billion - a figure Powell swiftly challenged, pointing out that the president was mistakenly including a separate building completed years ago.The tense exchange played out inside the under-renovation Marriner S. Eccles building, where Trump repeatedly insisted the renovation had jumped from $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion. Powell responded, “I'm not aware of that,” and eventually pointed out that Trump was including the Martin Building, a neighbouring site whose renovations had already been completed five years ago.Trump pulled out a folded sheet of paper from his pocket and insisted the figure “just came out,” despite Powell stating no one at the Fed had mentioned such a number.“It was built five years ago,” Powell said flatly, to which Trump responded, “It’s a building that’s being built.” Powell shook his head in disagreement: “I’m not aware of that, Mr President.”After several rounds of back-and-forth, Powell scrutinised the document and asked: “This came from us?” When Trump confirmed, Powell repeated: “You just added in a third building. That’s a third building.”The renovation of the Federal Reserve's headquarters has become the latest flashpoint in the president's ongoing campaign to undermine Powell, whom he has long criticised for not cutting interest rates aggressively enough.The Fed says the current cost estimate is $2.5 billion, up from an original $1.9 billion. According to officials, much of the increase is due to rising construction costs, tariffs, and the requirements of historic preservation and advanced security measures.White House deputy chief of staff James Blair later downplayed Powell’s correction, calling it a case of “splitting hairs” over a $600 million difference. “The cost overrun is massive,” he said.Trump, frustrated, remarked that in his real estate career he would have fired someone over such a budget increase. He also joked that Powell could earn his favour by slashing interest rates, a move Powell has resisted, saying the Fed would remain patient in monitoring inflation and the impact of tariffs.Trump’s visit to the Fed's headquarters – including a rare press tour of the construction site – was seen as part of a broader effort to exert pressure on Powell, with Trump and some allies hinting at removing him before his term ends in 2026. While Trump recently said he had no immediate plans to fire Powell, he also remarked, “I think it sort of is” grounds for removal, citing the renovation’s cost.Despite the president’s public criticism, not everyone in the administration agrees Powell should go. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business, “There’s nothing that tells me that he should step down right now. He’s been a good public servant.”","Trump claimed the cost of the project had ballooned to $3.1 billion - a figure Powell swiftly challenged.

Bastion of Balapur Fort in Akola caves in after heavy rain





CHANDRAPUR/NAGPUR: Following the forecast of heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places, with isolated extremely heavy rainfall very likely over Vidarbha on Friday, district administrations of Chandrapur and Bhandara announced the precautionary closure of educational institutions for July 25.The Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) issued a red alert for Gondia, Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, and Bhandara for Friday. An orange alert was sounded for Nagpur and Wardha. Heavy to very heavy rainfall activity was forecast over Vidarbha until July 26.These east Vidarbha districts received rain in the last 24 hours, with Chandrapur recording 81mm rainfall, Gondia 58mm, Nagpur 25mm, Gadchiroli 46mm, and Bhandara 20mm.With a low-pressure system brewing over the North Bay of Bengal, consistent rainfall lashed Chandrapur, Bhandara, Gadchiroli, and Gondia districts over the past three days, leading to a sharp rise in water levels across major rivers and water bodies.Virur station police personnel in Chandrapur rescued around 60 people, including about 30 children, on Wednesday evening when two MSRTC buses got stranded near Sirshi villages on the Varun-Virur road due to a flooded nullah.Sub-inspector Santosh Wakde and his team braved the treacherous conditions and provided snacks and water to the anxious children and villagers, and stayed with them for nearly three hours until water receded.By late night, the police led the buses out of the flooded stretch and safely dropped off the children at their villages - including Dongargaon, Subai, Kawidpeth, and Chincholi - by midnight.In Akola district, a portion of the historical Balapur Fort - a bastion wall - collapsed following two days of continuous heavy rain. No injuries or loss of life was reported.The fort houses key administrative offices, including the sub-divisional officer, tehsil office, and Panchayat Samiti, with hundreds of citizens visiting daily.Chandrapur recorded 52.8mm rainfall in the last 24 hours, with Korpana and Ballarpur registering the highest at 102.7mm and 94mm.

People of Gaza describe their living conditions





A Gaza-based photographer has revealed the heartbreaking reality behind a viral image taken by him of a severely underweight child, captured amid the worsening humanitarian crisis in the territory.Speaking to BBC Newshour, Ahmed al-Arini said he took the photograph to ""show the rest of the world extreme hunger"" affecting babies and children in the Gaza Strip.While global food security experts have not formally declared a famine, United Nations agencies have warned that Gaza is in the grip of mass, man-made starvation. They cite Israel’s control over the flow of supplies into the Palestinian enclave as the primary cause- a claim Israel strongly denies. The Israeli government instead blames Hamas for malnutrition cases.According to the UN’s Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), around 20 per cent of children in Gaza City suffer from malnutrition, with the numbers growing daily. On Thursday, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini relayed a stark observation from a colleague, similar to the photographer's portrayal, - ""People in Gaza are neither dead nor alive, they are walking corpses.""Over 100 international humanitarian and human rights organisations have sounded the alarm on widespread hunger and urged immediate global intervention.Israel, which oversees all crossings into Gaza, maintains it is not imposing a blockade and continues to hold Hamas accountable for food shortages. The UN, however, says the level of aid entering the strip is critically low and the hunger crisis is without precedent.In a statement, Lazzarini said ""more than 100 people, the vast majority of them children, have reportedly died of hunger."" He added: ""Most children our teams are seeing are emaciated, weak and at high risk of dying if they don't get the treatment they urgently need."" He urged Israel to ""allow humanitarian partners to bring unrestricted and uninterrupted humanitarian assistance to Gaza.""UNRWA staff themselves are increasingly struggling. ""When caretakers cannot find enough to eat, the entire humanitarian system is collapsing,"" Lazzarini said, adding that staff are ""increasingly fainting from hunger while at work.""The World Health Organisation (WHO) echoed the warnings. On Wednesday, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, ""I don't know what you would call it other than mass starvation — and it's man-made.""In northern Gaza, 40-year-old Hanaa Almadhoun described worsening conditions. She told the BBC via WhatsApp, ""If [food and supplies] do exist then they come at exorbitant prices that no ordinary person can afford."" She explained that people had sold ""gold and personal belongings"" just to buy flour.""Every new day brings a new challenge"" as families scavenge for ""something edible,"" she added. ""With my own eyes, I've seen children rummaging through the garbage in search of food scraps.""During a visit to Israeli forces in Gaza on Wednesday, Israeli President Isaac Herzog insisted that his country was providing humanitarian aid ""according to international law."" But aid worker Tahani Shehada, based in Gaza, described a different reality saying, ""People are just trying to survive hour-by-hour. Even simple things like cooking [and] taking a shower have become luxuries."" She added: ""I have a baby. He's eight months old. He doesn't know what fresh fruit tastes like.""In early March, Israel suspended aid deliveries to Gaza following a temporary ceasefire. Though some restrictions were later eased, shortages of food, fuel, and medicine have only deepened.To streamline relief efforts, Israel and the United States established the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), but deadly incidents have continued. The UN human rights office reports that over 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces while attempting to collect food aid in the last two months, according to BBC.At least 766 of those deaths occurred near one of GHF’s four distribution centres, operated by US private contractors inside Israeli military zones. Another 288 were killed near UN and other aid convoys.Israel maintains that Hamas incites disorder near aid convoys and insists that its troops fire only warning shots, avoiding civilian harm. The GHF has accused the UN of relying on ""false"" data from Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry.Najah, a 19-year-old widow sheltering at a Gaza hospital, said she fears for her life every time she attempts to reach an aid site. She told the BBC: ""I hope they bring us something to eat and drink. We die of hunger with nothing to eat or drink. We live in tents. We are finished off.""Dr Aseel, a physician working with a UK-based medical charity in Gaza, disputed the suggestion that famine is looming — saying it’s already here. ""My husband went once [to an aid distribution point] and twice and then got shot and that was it,"" she said. ""If we are to die from hunger, let it be. The path to aid is the path to death.""Gaza market seller Abu Alaa described his family's daily struggle: ""We go to bed hungry every night. We are not alive. We are dead. We are pleading with the whole world to intervene and save us.""Meanwhile, Eight months pregnant with her third child, Walaa Fathi said Gaza is experiencing a level of deprivation few imagined possible. From Deir al-Balah, she told the BBC: ""We are experiencing a catastrophe and a famine that no one could have imagined. I hope that my baby stays in my womb and I don't have to give birth in these difficult circumstances.""","Gaza-based photographer Ahmed al-Arini has revealed the heartbreaking reality behind a viral image taken by him of a severely underweight child.

'Epstein scam': Trump blames 'Democrats con job' for distraction from 'great six months of service'; hopes grand jury files will 'put an end to this',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/epstein-scam-trump-blames-democrats-con-job-for-distraction-from-great-six-months-of-service-hopes-grand-jury-files-will-put-an-end-to-this/articleshow/122892805.cms,"



US President Donald Trump on Thursday (local time) hit out at what he called a “Democrat con job”, after reports claimed that his name appears multiple times in files linked to the child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.In a statement posted on social media, Trump claimed the Democratic Party was using the Epstein case as a political weapon, to distract from what the GOP achieved in the past 6 months of his tenure.“The Radical Left Democrats are doing everything in their power to distract and obfuscate from our GREAT six months of service to America, results of which many are saying is the BEST six months in Presidential history,” the US president wrote on Truth Social.“They have gone absolutely CRAZY, and are playing another Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax but, this time, under the guise of what we will call the Jeffrey Epstein SCAM,” he added.Trump insisted that the public would soon see the truth, pinning hopes on the release of court materials. “As things are revealed and, I hope will take place quickly, you will see that it is yet another Democrat CON JOB. Hopefully, the Grand Jury Files will put an end to this HOAX.”He said that everyone should witness what is in the files but no one innocent should be hurt.“Everyone should see what is there, but people who are innocent should not be hurt. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”The remarks come days after a Wall Street Journal report claimed that Attorney General Pam Bondi had informed Trump earlier this year that his name had been referenced repeatedly in the unsealed Epstein documents.Justice department officials have said the files do not amount to grounds for further investigation or prosecution. Nonetheless, the documents have stirred unease across party lines, with Democratic leaders now calling for full transparency.Tensions surrounding Donald Trump’s links to Jeffrey Epstein have deepened, following the emergence of previously unseen photos and videos that shed fresh light on the US President’s relationship with the convicted sex offender.The newly surfaced footage, reported by CNN, shows Trump laughing, conversing, and attending key events with Epstein, including the disgraced financier’s 1993 wedding at New York’s Plaza Hotel.Trump has long accused the Democrats of fabricating the 2016 election controversy, dismissing allegations that Russian interference played a role in his victory.Earlier, in a post on Truth Social, the president said that Barack Obama, along with Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and others, orchestrated what he described as “the crime of the century,” alleging they falsely promoted the idea that Russian meddling helped him win the presidency.Trump insisted there is “clear proof” against the group, maintaining his position that the controversy was politically motivated and entirely manufactured.","US President Donald Trump hit out at what he called a “Democrat con job”, after reports claimed that his name appears multiple times in files linked to the child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

New Yorkers were greeted with an unexpected sight on Wednesday when a bright red sculpture of US President Donald Trump rising from a manhole was seen in Manhattan.The life-size statue was titled Donald and was installed by French street artist James Colomina at the corner of East 42nd Street and 2nd Avenue.The figure wore a suit and tie, showing Trump from the waist up as he appeared to rise out of a manhole. A small red rat peeked out from under the cover.""I installed the sculpture in New York because this is where he built his image, his empire, his legend,"" Colomina was quoted as saying to USA Today. ""A city he tried to conquer with golden towers and brutal slogans. I wanted this image – a red body rising from the sewers – to disturb that landscape.""The statue was placed roughly a mile from Trump Tower. However, it was quickly removed by a maintenance worker.Colomina said the entire sculpture was made in France over three weeks. He transported it to New York in parts and reassembled it on site early that morning. A photo of the installation was shared on his Instagram story with the caption “Make America Grime Again,” a play on Trump’s well-known MAGA slogan.The artwork created a stark visual contrast with its surroundings, particularly with the tall Chrysler Building behind it.“The sculpture is installed right across from the Chrysler Building, a symbol of power, elevation, and architectural pride,” Colomina said. “I liked the idea of creating a stark contrast between this vertical monument and the grotesque figure emerging from the sewers.”The White House responded with a dismissive tone. Spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told USA Today, “Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. This 'artist' will have to go back to the drawing board. Or perhaps art school.”Colomina is known for his bold, scarlet-red statues placed in public spaces around the world, including Paris, Tokyo, and Barcelona. His work often touches on urgent social and political themes.According to his biography on the Galeries Bartoux website, “The ‘Colomina Red,’ the artist’s visual signature, embodies the anger, passion, and urgency of the issues he tackles.”“James Colomina favors a clandestine, spontaneous approach: He places his works directly in the street, without prior announcement, transforming everyday spaces into platforms for artistic reflection,” the biography says.",Sculpture of US President Donald Trump rising from a manhole was seen in Manhattan.

'Reckless decision': US hits out at France’s push to recognise Palestinian state; claims it serves Hamas propaganda,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/reckless-decision-us-hits-out-at-frances-push-to-recognise-palestinian-state-claims-it-serves-hamas-propaganda/articleshow/122892678.cms,"US' Marco Rubio and France's Emmanuel Macron

Netanyahu calls Macron’s decision 'grave mistake'



Ceasefire talks







The United States on Thursday strongly opposed France’s decision to recognise a Palestinian state at the United Nations general assembly in September.US secretary of state Marco Rubio disapproved of France’s decision, calling it ‘Hamas propaganda’ and a setback to peace efforts in the Middle East.Rubio posted on X, “The United States strongly rejects Emmanuel Macron’s plan to recognize a Palestinian state at the UN general assembly. This reckless decision only serves Hamas propaganda and sets back peace. It is a slap in the face to the victims of October 7th.”French President Emmanuel Macron had earlier announced the decision to formally recognise Palestine during the September UN session.Macron took to X to announce the decision: “True to its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognise the State of Palestine.”France has long supported a two-state solution but has stopped short of formal recognition until now. Macron confirmed that France backs a Palestinian state without Hamas, and also reaffirmed support for Israel’s right to peace and security.Macron said he hoped the move would help generate a “collective dynamic” that would encourage Arab states to also recognise Israel. His announcement follows similar recognition from Ireland, Spain, Norway and Slovenia.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Macron’s decision “a grave mistake”. He criticised the French president for allegedly ignoring the threat posed by Hamas and other armed groups. “Israel will not accept moral lectures about statehood from countries that reject independence in their own territories,” Netanyahu said.France’s announcement comes amid the collapse of Gaza ceasefire talks in Doha. The United States, alongside Israel, withdrew from negotiations this week after failing to make progress. US special envoy Steve Witkoff accused Hamas of not “acting in good faith” and said, “Washington would now consider alternative options”.He added, “Hamas's response clearly shows a lack of desire to reach a ceasefire in Gaza.” Witkoff confirmed the US team was returning home and said other routes would be explored to bring hostages back and stabilise Gaza.The ceasefire talks, facilitated by Qatar, were aimed at halting the ongoing conflict and securing the release of Israeli hostages. But Hamas’s latest proposal, which included changes to aid delivery routes, military withdrawal zones and conditions for a permanent ceasefire, was not accepted by Israel. Netanyahu blamed Hamas for the deadlock and warned against misinterpreting Israel’s desire for a deal as weakness.“We are working to reach another deal for the release of our hostages,” he said. “But if Hamas interprets our willingness to reach a deal as a weakness, as an opportunity to dictate surrender terms that would endanger the State of Israel, it is gravely mistaken.”International concern continues to grow over Gaza’s worsening humanitarian crisis. The world health organization has warned of “man-made” famine conditions, with over two million Palestinians facing food and aid shortages. France blamed Israel’s blockade for the crisis, a claim that Israel rejected, accusing Hamas of obstructing aid distribution.Relief groups say they face huge challenges due to limited Israeli permissions and ongoing fighting. Meanwhile, voices on the ground are urging an end to the bloodshed.More than 140 countries already recognise Palestine, and France’s recognition would mark one of the most high-profile endorsements yet.The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,219 people. It has continued for 21 months. According to Gaza’s health ministry, 59,587 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have died in Israeli strikes.","US secretary of state Marco Rubio disapproved of France’s decision, calling it ‘Hamas propaganda’ and a setback to peace efforts in the Middle East.

"New warning for green card holders in US: Always carry THIS at all times with you, CBP reminds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-warning-for-green-card-holders-in-us-always-carry-this-at-all-times-with-you-cbp-reminds/articleshow/122866588.cms,"CBP issued a reminder to Green Card holders asking them to always carry the document with them.

What are Alien Registration Documents ?

Alien Registration Number (A-Number)

This is a unique 7–9 digit number assigned to non-citizens by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). This is used to track immigration records, applications, and status. This commonly starts with an “A”.

Green Card

Officially known as Form I-551, this is issued to lawful permanent residents. The Donald Trump administration has broken the conception that Green Card holders can't be arrested and their citizenship can't be revoked. A Green Card includes a photo, the A-number, category of admission and expiry date. This is proof of the right to live and work in the US permanently.

Employment Authorization Document



Arrival-departure record







The Customs and Border Police issued an important reminder the all green card holders that they have to carry at all times with them the proof of their alien registration as mandated by the law. ""Failing to do so can lead to a misdemeanor and fines if you are stopped by federal law enforcement,"" the reminder issued Wednesday said.This is not a new law and non-citizens are required to carry proof of their legal status in the US always but the Trump administration's reminder shows that the crackdown on green card holders, lawful permanent residents, will continue and just because they are legally residing in the country, it does not mean they will not be punished. The State Department earlier made it clear that permanent residents can also be deported if they are found flouting laws.Form I-7666 is also known as a work permit which is issued to non-citizens who are temporarily authorized to work. This contains the A number, photo and validity dates.I-94 documents a non-citizen's entry and authorized stay. This document includes the A-number for certain visa holders. This is issued at ports of entry or online for air travelers.Under US immigration law, most non-citizens over age 14 who stay in the U.S. for more than 30 days must carry their alien registration documentation at all times.","CBP issued a reminder to Green Card holders asking them to always carry the document with them.

The White House's first reaction to Wednesday night's South Park premiere attacking President Donald Trump is here. Trump's White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told Rolling Stone: ""The Left's hypocrisy truly has no end — for years they have come after South Park for what they labeled as 'offense' [sic] content, but suddenly they are praising the show.""Just like the creators of South Park, the Left has no authentic or original content, which is why their popularity continues to hit record lows. This show hasn't been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention. President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country's history — and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump's hot streak. ""After a gap of almost two and a half years, South Park kicked off its 27th season after creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone reached a $1.5 billion streaming deal with Paramount.

The woman who rescued an Indian man after a brutal mob attack in Dublin has now shared fresh details on Facebook video, saying he was falsely accused of being a paedophile, stabbed in the face, stripped naked, and left bleeding on the road for over an hour before help arrived.Jennifer Murray, a resident in Tallaght, said she was driving past a roundabout on Saturday evening when she saw a crowd of nearly 30 people, including teenagers and some adults, standing around. Murray said she stopped her car when she noticed a man standing alone, covered in blood.She said he was bleeding from head to toe. His nose was pouring blood. He told her, ‘Please help me, please save me,’” she recalled. She said took him to her car and waited more than an hour for an ambulance. Gardaí, the state police force of the Republic of Ireland, confirmed they received a call around 6pm and that the man was later taken to Tallaght University Hospital.The man, believed to be in his 40s, had come to Ireland three weeks earlier for a job at Amazon. He was on his way to a temple when a group of around 10 teenagers attacked him from behind with a knife, shouting claims that he was a paedophile. According to Murray, they punched and kicked him, slashed his face, and robbed him of his phone, wallet, shoes, and trousers, leaving him naked in public.Murray says the man was traumatised and too ashamed to speak clearly. ""He was so extremely polite to me the whole time. I gave him a blanket to cover himself up. He was so embarrassed and shocked,"" she said. Later, she visited the home where he was staying and informed the Indian family who took him in. “They jumped into action. His housemate’s wife told me she had warned him that Ireland was not safe.”She also said the he was highly qualified, having studied at one of India’s top colleges, and was hired for a role that required specialised skills not readily available in the local workforce.Murray also claimed that four other Indian men and one more individual had been facially stabbed by the same gang over the past few days.","Jennifer Murray, a resident in Tallaght, said she was driving past a roundabout on Saturday evening when she saw a crowd of nearly 30 people, including teenagers and some adults, standing around.

US deputy attorney general Todd Blanche held a meeting with convicted sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell and her lawyer in Tallahassee, as pressure mounts on the justice department to disclose more about its handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case.The meeting lasted several hours, with Blanche posing extensive questions and Maxwell responding to each of them, according to her lawyer David Oscar Markus.“Productive day today with the Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and Ghislaine Maxwell,” he said, as quoted by CNN.“She never invoked a privilege. She never declined to answer. She answered all the questions truthfully, honestly and to the best of her ability,” Markus added, though he declined to reveal the content of the conversation.Blanche later confirmed he would return tomorrow to continue the interview. “The Department of Justice will share additional information about what we learned at the appropriate time,” he posted on X.The meeting comes just weeks before Maxwell is due to testify before the US Congress under subpoena. The House Oversight Committee has ordered her to appear on 11 August, calling her testimony “crucial” to understanding the federal government’s failings in the Epstein case, including controversial plea deals and prosecution gaps.Maxwell, a British socialite and former girlfriend of Epstein, is serving a 20-year sentence after being convicted in 2022 for grooming and trafficking underage girls in partnership with the disgraced financier. She has since filed an appeal.Blanche had earlier acknowledged that Maxwell was never before approached by federal investigators willing to hear her out.“That changes now,” he said, signalling a shift in the justice department’s posture under President Donald Trump’s directive to release all “credible evidence” related to Epstein’s crimes.Her lawyer also said that past prosecutors had avoided direct talks and welcomed the administration’s new approach.“The truth should not be feared or ignored,” Markus said. “We’re grateful someone is finally listening.”Maxwell’s possible testimony before Congress could mark a turning point in the saga, depending on whether she decides to fully cooperate. “She’s taking this one step at a time,” Markus said. “If she chooses to testify before Congress, and not plead the Fifth, she will speak the truth—as she always said she would,” he addedThe renewed attention to Maxwell’s case comes amid mounting scrutiny over the handling of Epstein-related investigations and growing calls for transparency. A federal judge in Florida last week refused to unseal grand jury records from the early 2000s, rejecting a request by the Trump administration to make them public.Meanwhile, political tensions continue to rise following a Wall Street Journal report highlighting past links between Trump and Epstein. The US president filed a defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch and the newspaper.","Deputy attorney general Todd Blanche held a meeting with convicted sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell and her lawyer in Tallahassee.

Chilling new details have emerged from police files revealing that the University of Idaho students murdered by Bryan Kohberger experienced unsettling incidents in the days leading up to their deaths.According to documents released by authorities on late Wednesday, the victims, Xana Kernodle, Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen and Ethan Chapin, returned to their off-campus home in Moscow, Idaho, on 4 November 2022 to find their front door wide open and loose on its hinges. The wind was blowing it open, and the damage was so concerning that Kernodle’s father was called in to fix it, the New York Post reported.This wasn’t the only troubling event before the brutal stabbings on 13 November. One of the surviving roommates, Bethany Funke, told investigators that Goncalves had been alarmed weeks earlier after spotting a strange man watching her while she was outside walking her dog. Goncalves was so disturbed by the encounter, which occurred near the back of the house, that she had called her roommates to ask when they’d be home.It remains unclear whether the man she saw was Kohberger or if the earlier events were directly connected to the murders.The files also provide harrowing details about the attack itself. Kernodle is said to have suffered over 50 stab wounds, including two to her heart. She was found lying on her back in a blood-soaked shirt and underwear, with multiple defensive wounds on her hands, including a deep gash between her fingers, signs she fought hard against her killer.Kohberger, 30, pleaded guilty to the murders as part of a deal to avoid the death penalty and was sentenced to four consecutive life terms. He did not speak in court to explain his motive or offer any apology for the crimes.“I share the desire expressed by others to understand the why,” said Judge Steven Hippler during sentencing. “But upon reflection, it seems to me, and this is just my own opinion, that by continuing to focus on why, we continue to give Mr Kohberger relevance, we give him agency and we give him power.”","Xana Kernodle, Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen and Ethan Chapin were found dead in their off-campus home in Moscow, Idaho, on 13 November 2022.

US president Donald Trump on Thursday visited the Federal Reserve’s renovation site in Washington, DC — and used the opportunity to take fresh shots at chair Jerome Powell.Standing in front of the half-finished project, Trump mocked the rising costs. “It looks like it’s about $3.1 billion. It went up a little bit — or a lot,” he said, while Powell shook his head in disagreement.Asked by a reporter how he’d handle such a budget mess as a developer, Trump didn’t hold back, “I’d fire him!”The central bank’s renovation was originally estimated at $1.9 billion. Now, it stands at $2.5 billion. The Fed says the hike is due to inflation, old infrastructure, and post-Covid material costs. But Trump and his aides say it's more than that — calling it excessive and accusing Powell of poor oversight.The visit was rare. Presidents usually avoid appearing to influence the independent central bank. But Trump has long clashed with Powell, criticising him for not lowering interest rates fast enough.At the site, Trump again pushed for rate cuts. “Our country is the hottest in the world right now,” he said. “But people can’t buy homes because the rates are too high.”The Fed is expected to hold rates steady again next week — despite mounting political pressure.","US president Donald Trump on Thursday visited the Federal Reserve’s renovation site in Washington, DC.

Tucker Carlson has raised concerns over Donald Trump’s handling of the renewed Epstein controversy.In an interview with Bild, the former Fox News anchor said people across the US were demanding clarity. “Normal people want to know what happened,” Carlson said. “It’s their right. Their government was involved.”Though he said he never met Epstein, Carlson questioned how the late financier gained access to heads of state and high-level officials without ever having a real job. ""So where did the money come from? And what was the point of this?,"" he said.He also dismissed the idea that Epstein’s death was a suicide. “It’s pretty clear he didn’t kill himself,” Carlson said.While staying diplomatic about Trump, Carlson said the US president ran on a promise to clean up Washington and expose corruption. ""Donald Trump ran for president on the promise that he would tell us, and that he’d end corruption in Washington. Now, that’s a big promise,"" he said.""I don’t think Trump had anything to do with Epstein, he knew Epstein. But I would be sincerely shocked if there was some weird sex stuff with Trump.I just don’t believe that. I’ve talked to Trump about it, I know him well,"" he added.As reports emerge showing Trump’s name in Epstein-related files, MAGA influencers and conservative voters are growing restless.While Carlosn, once a staunch Trump ally, has recently been at odds with Trump, some of Donald Trump’s staunchest supporters too are openly criticising how he’s dealing with the Epstein controversy, adding to growing calls from within the Republican camp to release the full files.Right-wing influencer Laura Loomer told Politico that the issue could “consume his presidency” if not addressed properly. She dismissed Trump’s claim that the files were part of a “hoax”, calling it unconvincing.Matt Walsh, host of The Matt Walsh Show, was also blunt — describing attorney general Pam Bondi’s response to the case as “humiliating”.",Tucker Carlson questions how late financier gained access to heads of state and high-level officials without ever having a real job.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Asim Munir for President? Pakistan Defence Minister Denies Amid Buzz Of Asif Ali Zardari Quitting





A political and diplomatic dogfight is underway over a prospective visit to Pakistan by US President Donald Trump en route to the Quad summit in India in September amid a gradual recalibration of ties in the region.Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit after pulling off a coup by arranging a luncheon meeting last month for the country's army chief Asim Munir with the US President.Munir charmed Trump by endorsing him for a Nobel Peace Prize, playing up to his craving for one, and the Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits, despite having thrown itself at China's feet for survival.Although the White House has not confirmed Trump's Quad attendance given New Delhi is yet to nail the dates -- which also depends on the leaders of Japan and Australia -- Pakistan's excitable media broadcast that the US President would visit Pakistan on September 18, before retracting the report because Trump will be on a state visit to the UK from September 17-19.There are indications though that Trump may stopover in Pakistan whenever he heads out to the Quad summit.This could be as late as November given the MAGA supremo's obsession with trade deals over strategic alignments. He has just delivered a tariff shock to Japan and also riled up Australia, while India has proved to be a tough negotiator, frustrating his trade boffins attempts to strong-arm New Delhi into a quick deal.In fact, Trump's fetish for tariffs and his fixation on trade deals puts a question mark over the strategic salience of the Quad even as long-time allies and partners adjust to his mercurial approach.According to some diplomats, India itself may have to reassess its approach to Trump-era Washington after a rosy-eyed view of long-term strategic ties with the US. They acknowledge that Trump’s response during his second term to the Pakistani outreach – driven more by opportunism than any strategic vision – clearly caught India off guard. New Delhi resents the re-hyphenation that would be implicit in such a two-fer, but has no way of thwarting it.If Trump does visit Pakistan, it will be the first US Presidential trip to the country in nearly two decades after George W Bush layover in 2006. Bush stopped by in Islamabad for a few hours under a tight security blanket on his way back from a three-day visit to New Delhi, talking up counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan while rejecting its pleas for a nuclear deal similar to the one he forged with India.Presidents Obama and Biden both disdained even a stopover while Trump himself trashed Pakistan during his first term, accusing it of ""nothing but lies & deceit"" and providing ""safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.""Pakistan is now promising to turn itself into a safe haven for US businesses promoted by Trump associates -- including transforming Islamabad into the ""crypto capital of South Asia"" and a ""global leader in the digital finance revolution,’ -- to land a Presidential visit.During his first term, Trump is famously said to have complained about landing in Iraq and Afghanistan with the lights on Air Force One turned off (as a security measure), despite the US having spent billions on the countries. If the Pakistan stopover comes through, he may well insist on landing in full sight – to soak up the fanfare and flattery.","Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit.
