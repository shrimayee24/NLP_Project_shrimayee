What is his current location? How is his health? There is no clarity on these matters.”The Shiv Sena leader said attempts by Rajya Sabha members to contact Dhankhar had failed, and rumours were circulating in Delhi that the former vice president had been “confined to his residence” and “reportedly not safe.”He warned that some MPs were considering a habeas corpus petition in the Supreme Court, but he had decided first to approach Shah: “Before knocking on the doors of the Supreme Court I thought it to be prudent to seek this information from you. ”Raut’s intervention follows similar calls from Independent MP Kapil Sibal, who questioned the silence around Dhankhar’s whereabouts. Sibal said he had “never heard of a ‘laapataa [missing] vice president’,” and noted that even Dhankhar’s family and close associates had offered no update. “The home ministry must know where Dhankhar is and must reveal it,” he said, warning that such secrecy “should not happen in a democracy. ”Dhankhar, 74, resigned midterm as vice president, just two years after assuming office in August 2022.

Op Sindoor: Report Reveals Pakistan Lost Rs 1240cr In 2 Months After Shutting Airspace For India

Key air and ground strikes against Pakistan

Aerial interception and final missile strike

NEW DELHI: Even as Operation Sindoor continues, the navies of India and Pakistan are set to conduct separate naval drills in the Arabian Sea starting tomorrow, defence sources confirmed on Sunday.According to officials, both navies have issued Notice to Airmen (NOTAMs) restricting air traffic in their respective territorial waters for the duration of the exercises.""Indian Navy warships would be carrying out drills in the Arabian Sea on August 11-12. Pakistan Navy has also issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) for carrying out its own naval exercises in its waters,"" defence sources said.A NOTAM is issued to alert pilots and air traffic controllers of airspace restrictions during specific operations, such as military drills.The drills come months after a tense military standoff in May when Prime Minister Narendra Modi reviewed Operation Sindoor with India’s top commanders.As per media reports, PM Modi reportedly told navy chief Admiral Dinesh Tripathi, “Humne aapke mooh se niwala cheen liya, aapko mauka phir milega” -- indicating the Navy’s planned strike on Karachi was called off at the last moment. Despite concerns about possible Pakistani retaliation, Modi gave full operational autonomy to the services.The military leadership displayed varied strengths: Air chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh, known for his daring as a test pilot; Army chief Gen Upendra Dwivedi, a troop-focused leader; and Admiral Tripathi, a strong advocate for naval offensive action. This blend helped execute coordinated strikes while balancing strategic caution.Between May 7 and 10, the Indian Air Force targeted critical Pakistani military assets, destroying fighter aircraft, radar systems, and airborne early warning platforms.The Army’s deployment of advanced artillery and loitering munitions forced Pakistani troops to retreat along the Line of Control.Concurrently, the Navy’s mobilisation pushed Pakistani vessels into shelter at Gwadar port.A significant engagement saw an Indian S-400 missile intercept a Pakistani Saab AEW&C aircraft deep inside Pakistan, severely impacting its surveillance capability.The conflict’s last strike was a BrahMos missile attack on the Bholari airbase on May 10, marking India’s successful mission completion.",Indian Navy warships would be carrying out drills in the Arabian Sea on August 11-12.

Five Al Jazeera journalists, including well-known correspondent Anas al-Sharif, were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a journalists’ tent in Gaza City on Sunday. The Israeli military confirmed it carried out the strike, accusing al-Sharif of being a Hamas operative who “posed as a journalist” and led a terrorist cell responsible for rocket attacks.Al Jazeera condemned the killings as a “targeted assassination” aimed at silencing independent reporting from Gaza, where international media access remains heavily restricted. The strike marks one of the deadliest incidents for the network since the war began nearly two years ago, during which over 200 media workers have been killed, according to press freedom groups.Al Jazeera confirmed that five of its staff died in the attack: correspondent Anas al-Sharif, fellow reporter Mohammed Qreiqeh, and camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal, and Moamen Aliwa.Also read: Journalist or Terrorist? Who was Anas al-Sharif? Al Jazeera reporter killed in Israeli strike The group had been sheltering in a tent opposite Al-Shifa Medical Complex, a site long used by media crews. Al-Sharif, 28, was one of the most recognisable Arabic-language reporters covering the conflict, known for his frontline reports from northern Gaza. Hours before his death, he posted footage on X showing nearby Israeli strikes. The killings have deepened concerns about journalist safety in Gaza, where local reporters provide most coverage due to the ban on foreign press entering without Israeli military escort.In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described Anas al-Sharif as a “Hamas terrorist” who used journalism as cover. They claimed intelligence from Gaza — including rosters, training records, and salary documents — proved his affiliation. According to the IDF, al-Sharif led a Hamas cell responsible for organising rocket attacks on Israeli civilians and troops. “A press badge isn’t a shield for terrorism,” the statement read. The military also accused Al Jazeera of integrating Hamas operatives into its reporting teams. Israel has long accused the Qatar-based network of bias, while Al Jazeera says such claims are politically motivated attempts to justify attacks on its journalists.Al Jazeera condemned the attack as a “blatant and premeditated assault” on press freedom. The network accused Israel of deliberately targeting its journalists following repeated incitement by Israeli officials. It said the slain reporters were among the last to remain in Gaza, providing live, unfiltered accounts of the humanitarian crisis. The broadcaster warned that the killings were part of a wider campaign to “silence the truth” about the war. Calling for urgent international action, Al Jazeera argued that immunity for perpetrators fuels further attacks and urged governments to pressure Israel to halt the targeting of media workers.The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said it was “appalled” by the deaths, warning that Israel’s practice of branding reporters as militants without public evidence raises “serious questions about its respect for press freedom.” CPJ Regional Director Sara Qudah stressed that journalists are civilians and must never be targeted. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) noted that over 200 journalists have been killed in Gaza since the war began, making it one of the deadliest conflicts for media in recent decades. Both organisations called for an independent investigation into the strike and for the protection of reporters working in conflict zones.Israel and Al Jazeera have had a strained relationship for years. The Israeli government has banned the broadcaster from operating inside the country, accused it of incitement, and raided its offices. The latest war in Gaza has heightened tensions, with Al Jazeera frequently challenging Israeli narratives about military operations. Qatar, which funds the network, also hosts the political leadership of Hamas and has mediated indirect talks between Israel and the group. Critics say this fuels Israeli mistrust of the channel, while supporters argue it remains one of the few outlets providing on-the-ground coverage from Gaza.With Gaza sealed off from most international journalists, global news organisations rely heavily on local reporters like al-Sharif for coverage. These journalists face extreme danger, lacking the protection afforded to embedded foreign correspondents. Many live under constant bombardment, while also coping with shortages of food, water, and medical care. The deaths of prominent figures such as al-Sharif further diminish the flow of independent reporting from the enclave. UN agencies and rights groups have warned that the loss of these voices leaves the world reliant on official statements and severely limits scrutiny of military actions.Before the strike, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed foreign media, defending Israel’s expanded military operations in Gaza. He insisted Israel must “finish the job” by dismantling Hamas strongholds, not only in Gaza City but also in the central refugee camps and Muwasi. Netanyahu promised “safe zones” for civilians, though similar areas have been bombed in the past. He also announced plans to bring more foreign journalists into Gaza under military supervision. Critics, including the UN, warned that the expansion risks worsening the humanitarian disaster in the territory, which is already facing severe food shortages and mass displacement.The UN Security Council held an emergency meeting after Netanyahu’s announcement, but no concrete action was agreed. The United States defended Israel’s right to act against Hamas, rejecting allegations of genocide. China condemned the “collective punishment” of Gaza’s population, while Russia warned against a “reckless intensification” of hostilities. UN humanitarian official Ramesh Rajasingham said starvation was already occurring, with conditions “beyond horrific. ” Rights groups argue that targeting journalists undermines transparency and accountability in such a crisis, making independent reporting all the more crucial.Gaza’s health ministry reports more than 61,000 Palestinians killed since the war began, with roughly half being women and children. The conflict has displaced the majority of Gaza’s population and driven parts of the territory into famine. The ministry says at least 100 children and 117 adults have died from malnutrition-related causes since June. Aid delivery remains chaotic, with incidents of gunfire reported near distribution sites. Israel denies pursuing a policy of starvation, blaming shortages on Hamas. Humanitarian agencies say access restrictions and ongoing fighting are preventing sufficient relief efforts.Palestinian officials, press freedom advocates, and humanitarian organisations have called for the killings of al-Sharif and his colleagues to be investigated as war crimes. They argue the strike fits a broader pattern of silencing journalists who document alleged abuses. Al Jazeera says its slain reporters embodied the “courage and resilience” of Gaza’s press, working despite personal risk to expose the war’s impact. As the conflict nears its second year, the network warns that without independent witnesses, the humanitarian crisis will unfold largely unseen — and those responsible will face even less scrutiny.","Five Al Jazeera journalists were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a journalists’ tent in Gaza City on Sunday.

This was the pilot's second marriage, his first wife having died by suicide, leaving behind a son. The woman agreed to marry on the understanding that she would not have children of her own and would take care of the pilot's son.Their relationship soured quickly. Despite owning three houses in Mumbai, the pilot transferred his properties and moved into a rented flat. He then installed CCTV cameras in every room and microphones in the bathrooms. The wife alleged cruelty, and their disputes escalated to police involvement. The pilot admitted to the installations but claimed he was concerned for the safety of family members - a defence the court rejected.Tensions worsened when the wife went on a hunger strike, prompting the husband to file a police complaint. The couple's cohabitation lasted only two years before the wife returned to Ahmedabad in July 2015, where she has lived since.The husband sought divorce, while the wife filed for restitution of conjugal rights. A family court in Ahmedabad rejected the divorce plea on grounds of cruelty by the husband and said that it was a sacrifice on the part of the wife, who gave up her right to have children while agreeing to the marriage. The matter then reached the High Court.After hearing the case, the bench of Justice A Y Kogje and Justice N S Sanjay Gowda said, ""This is a case where continuation of the cohabitation of the husband and wife would only amount to perpetuating cruelty upon both of them. The fact that the husband installed CCTV cameras in all the rooms and also a microphone in the bathroom in the initial period of their marital life would itself clearly indicate that the question of there being a normal marital life between them is beyond the realm of possibility. ""Dissolving the marriage, the court further stated, ""Given the passage of time since they are separate and their apparent animosity to each other which has resulted in multiple litigations, it is clearly apparent that the marriage is beyond repair.""","Gujarat High Court orders pilot to pay his wife Rs 1 lakh per month as permanent alimony for her lifetime.

Parents lodged missing complaint on June 29, says SP

BHUBANESWAR: A 17-year-old teenager killed his 12-year-old younger brother and buried the body close to their house one-and-a-half months back without giving the slightest hint until police arrested him at Titilagarh in Balangir on Saturday.The accused told police that he committed the crime because he constantly felt sidelined and neglected because his parents paid more attention to his sibling.For around 45 days it was a blind case for the police. But a vital clue provided by the accused's parents during questioning unravelled the mystery. The accused's mother told police that when she returned home on June 28 evening, her elder son (the accused) was washing the floor.When police asked if he did it regularly, she replied in the negative bringing the older sibling under the purview of the investigation. He confessed to the crime soon after. Sources said the accused tried to clean the blood after he stabbed his younger brother. The accused used an agricultural tool kept in the house to dig the pit twice, once immediately after the murder and again late at night on the same day, police said.IGP (northern range) Himanshu Kumar Lal said the boy first buried the body inside the house and then late in the night shifted it to another place nearby, fearing his parents would suspect if the body remained inside. ""After it was ascertained that the older sibling was involved, it was not tough to establish the crime. So we exhumed the body,"" he said.SP (Balangir) Abilash G said the parents, both daily-wage labourers, lodged a missing complaint at Titlagarh police station on June 29. Initially police suspected it to be a case of child trafficking. ""Though police officers were deployed strategically and all CCTV cameras were scanned, we were getting no result. Interrogation of the parents time and again led to the detection,"" the SP said. The minor accused in the case is being treated under the category of Children In Conflict with Law (CICL).","Parents lodged missing complaint on June 29, says SP Abilash G.

A BMC supervisor filed a complaint after seeing Sanklecha's actions. Sanklecha allegedly placed a grain-filled tray on his car.

MUMBAI: Shivaji Park police on Saturday booked a 55-year-old Lalbaug resident, Mahendra Sanklecha, for allegedly feeding pigeons by placing a grain-filled tray on his car's roof near Dadar Kabutarkhana. While police have seized the car, they issued a notice to Sanklecha asking him to join the investigation.The action came after Sandesh Matkar, a junior supervisor at BMC's G-North ward, lodged a police complaint stating that on Saturday, around 7.30am, Sanklecha drove to Dadar Kabutarkhana in his car and placed the grain-filled tray for pigeons. The complainant told police that he received a video clip in which Sanklecha said he would bring 12 more cars to feed pigeons there when locals raised objections.Matkar submitted the car's registration number to police who tracked down Sanklecha and issued him a notice. He was booked under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita sections 223 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 270 (public nuisance), and 271 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life).Earlier, on Aug 6, hundreds of Jain community members had congregated at Dadar Kabutarkhana.The protesters, largely women, had climbed the bamboo structures, pulled off the tarpaulin placed by BMC, entered the feeding zone and tossed grains despite the ban on feeding pigeons in public areas and the high court order.On Sunday, police patrolling around the area was beefed up following the Saturday incident. BMC has been penalising violators Rs 500 under Solid Waste Management By-Laws and has collected over Rs 68,700 in fines from 142 cases between July 13 and Aug 3, 2025, across nearly 42 locations.","Mahendra Sanklecha, 55, was booked for feeding pigeons near Dadar Kabutarkhana.

Journalist or Terrorist? Who was Anas al-Sharif? Al Jazeera reporter killed in Israeli strike,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/journalist-or-terrorist-who-was-anas-al-sharif-al-jazeera-reporter-killed-in-israeli-strike/articleshow/123226538.cms,"Who he was



What the IDF claimed







Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif was killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza City, alongside four of his colleagues. The attack targeted a tent for journalists outside the main gate of al-Shifa Hospital late on Sunday evening, killing seven people in total.Al Jazeera confirmed the deaths of correspondents al-Sharif and Mohammed Qreiqeh, along with cameramen Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa. The broadcaster condemned what it called a “blatant and premeditated attack on press freedom”, describing al-Sharif as “one of Gaza’s bravest journalists” who had reported from the front lines since the start of the war.Also read: 5 Al Jazeera journalists killed in Israeli strike - 10 points Moments before his death, al-Sharif posted on X warning of “intense, concentrated Israeli bombardment” across Gaza City. In a final message, written months earlier to be released if he was killed, he said he had “never hesitated to convey the truth” despite enduring “pain, grief and loss repeatedly.”Also read: Final message of Al Jazeera reporter killed in Israeli strike; his ‘do not forget Gaza’ call The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said it was “appalled” by the killings, warning of a pattern in which Israel labels journalists as militants without providing credible evidence. The Palestinian Journalists’ Syndicate described the strike as a “bloody crime” of assassination.Anas al-Sharif, 28, was a well-known Al Jazeera Arabic correspondent who became one of the most recognisable voices covering the war in Gaza. Married with two young children, he had refused to leave northern Gaza even after his father was killed in an Israeli strike in December 2023.He had reported extensively from northern Gaza, often documenting the aftermath of Israeli bombardments. Last month, he told CPJ he feared being “bombed and martyred at any moment” after an Israeli military spokesperson publicly accused him of being a Hamas member. The UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression called that claim “unsubstantiated” and a “blatant assault on journalists.”Al-Sharif’s colleagues say he was committed to showing the world the reality in Gaza. “They were targeted in their tent; they weren’t covering from the front line,” Al Jazeera’s managing editor Mohamed Moawad told the BBC.The Israel Defense Forces confirmed it carried out the strike, alleging al-Sharif “posed as a journalist” and served as the head of a Hamas cell responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and troops.The IDF said documents recovered in Gaza — including training records, personnel lists and salary details — proved his affiliation with Hamas. It added that precision weapons, aerial surveillance and intelligence were used to minimise civilian casualties.Al Jazeera and press freedom groups have rejected the claims, accusing Israel of attempting to justify the killing of journalists and silence reporting from inside Gaza.","Anas al-Sharif, 28, was a well-known Al Jazeera Arabic correspondent.

Pakistan prepares for SCO Summit amidst security concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-prepares-for-sco-summit-amidst-security-concerns/articleshow/114180796.cms,"Representative image.

Pakistan is gearing up to secure its capital, Islamabad, ahead of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. The event, taking place on Tuesday and Wednesday, will see the attendance of key regional leaders, including India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and China's Premier Li Qiang.In preparation for the summit, Pakistan's government has implemented strict measures. These include strict enforcement against movements protesting ethnic nationalism and new laws that limit demonstrations in the capital. Authorities have also detained hundreds of supporters of opposition leader Imran Khan , who is currently jailed, following their attempt to march in Islamabad.Security concerns have been heightened by a recent attack on a convoy of Chinese engineers in Karachi, raising fears for the safety of foreign nationals amid ongoing separatist violence. The government has responded by authorizing troop deployments in the capital throughout the summit's duration.Imtiaz Gul, a security analyst, emphasized the importance of the summit for Pakistan, stating, ""The government claims to have made elaborate security arrangements and understandably so because it has to make sure that the event passes off peacefully without any untoward incident.""The SCO, which includes China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, and six other member states, is viewed by some as an alternative to Western alliances such as NATO. The agenda for the Islamabad summit focuses on trade, humanitarian, and cultural issues, though domestic issues in Pakistan may loom large.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, led by Imran Khan, has threatened protests during the summit. Ahsan Iqbal Chaudhary, Pakistan's minister for planning, accused the PTI of trying to disrupt the event, stating, ""The PTI doesn't want to showcase the positive side of Pakistan to the world. Instead, they aim to present a picture of the country filled with tear gas and unrest.""To facilitate the summit, Islamabad and the neighboring city of Rawalpindi will observe a public holiday starting Monday, accompanied by road closures to reduce movement. The government quarter hosting the summit has been fortified and prepared for the visiting dignitaries.Pakistan, heavily reliant on Chinese investment for infrastructure projects, is keen to ensure the safety of its citizens and foreign guests, especially considering the broader uptick in militancy linked to the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan.The authorities aim for a peaceful summit to enhance the country's image amidst various internal and external challenges.","Pakistan is hosting a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.

Catholic leaders in Michigan, including all seven diocesan bishops, have expressed strong disapproval of governor Gretchen Whitmer 's recent viral video, which has been widely viewed as ridiculing the Christian sacrament of Holy Communion , as reported by Fox News.The clip, shared on feminist author Liz Plank ’s Instagram page, features Whitmer wearing a Harris-Walz hat and placing a Doritos chip into Plank’s mouth while she kneels on the floor. ""It is not just distasteful or ‘strange;’ it is an all-too-familiar example of an elected official mocking religious persons and their practices,"" said Paul A Long, president and CEO of the Michigan Catholic Conference (MCC), in a statement representing the views of the state’s Catholic leaders.The video was intended to promote US vice president Kamala Harris ’ policies ahead of the presidential election , emerging from Whitmer’s appearance on Plank’s "" Chip Chat "" podcast published on YouTube. Plank’s caption read, ""If he won’t, Gretchen Whitmer will. Chips aren’t just delicious, the CHIPS Act is a game-changer for US tech and manufacturing, boosting domestic production of semiconductors to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers! Donald Trump would put that at risk.""In their statement, the Catholic conference expressed ""profound disappointment and offense"" regarding Whitmer's actions. They noted that the skit features Whitmer mimicking the gesture of administering Communion, saying, ""The governor then stares expressionless into the camera.""Conservatives on social media have also accused Whitmer and Plank of mocking the Christian sacrament.

Like Epstein's list, a list of names, all celebrities, with links to P Diddy and his Freak sessions, are doing the rounds on social media.The alleged list contains names of Leonardo Dicaprio , Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern, Russell Brand, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Russell Simmons, Usher, Meghan Fox. The list goes viral as Usher, Pink deleted their X posts and theories that Justin Bieber might have been a victim of Diddy float around. Nobody has been implicated in the Sean Combs case so far.P Diddy is facing serious charges of sex trafficking and racketeering where he forced women to have sex with male prostitutes that continued for days as the entire action was caught on camera. Huge stocks of baby oil, drugs were found at Diddy's sex den while Diddy did not plead guilty to the charges.The hip-hop mogul, who maintains his innocence, has been denied bail twice since his September arrest.Usher who once stayed with Diddy said his X account got hacked and that's why all his past posts disappeared. This happened as his old statement in which said he witnessed wild things when he stayed with Diddy resurfaced.Apart from Usher and Pink, Megan Fox deleted all her posts on Instagram and X triggering speculations over how she was linked to Diddy.An old snipped of Khloe Kardashian claiming that she attended one of Diddy's naked parties emerged. ""I got on a plane at 5:30 am. Well this party...I think half the people there were butt naked,"" this is exactly what Khloe said about Diddy's party.Diddy was Justin Bieber's mentor but Bieber's spokesperson said he is trying not to focus on the charges and accusation of Diddy. Justin is in a happy bubble since he became a father.As the list of the Hollywood A-listers becomes long, they are maintaining absolute silence over Diddy's arrest.An officer involved in the raid on Diddy's home likened him to Jeffrey Epstein, alleging that he moved in the same social circles as Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. The officer mentioned that wild parties had been ongoing for 15 years, noting that while not all attendees were directly involved in trafficking, many witnessed inappropriate conduct. He stressed that a lot of people were aware of what transpired, particularly as the events became more explicit late at night.Also read on the Diddy case:","No Hollywood A-lister has been implicated in the Sean Diddy trafficking case but several 'Diddy lists' are viral.

Ohio Senator and Donald Trump's running mate, JD Vance has revealed he feels bad about bringing his wife, Usha Vance , to church every week, saying that ""she didn't sign up for this."" Vance said that Usha was raised in a Hindu household, has not converted to Catholicism despite attending Mass regularly.In an interview with the, Vance, admitted to feeling uncomfortable about how his religious journey has affected his wife. “I feel — felt — kind of bad,” he explained. “Like, ‘Oh, you didn’t sign up to marry a weekly churchgoer, and are you OK with this?’ And she was sort of more than OK with it, and that was a big part of the confirmation that this was the right thing for me.”Vance revealed that Usha encouraged him to explore Catholicism even though she did not follow the faith herself. “She thought that they were good for me, in a sort of good-for-your-soul kind of way,” he said. “I don’t think I would have ever done it without her support, because I felt kind of bad about it, right?”Reflecting on his spiritual growth, Vance shared his deeper motivations. “When I started to think about the big things, like, what do I actually care about in my life? I really want to be a good husband. I really want to be a good father. I really want to be a good member of the community. I wanted to be a virtuous human being, in other words.”Despite Usha's support, Vance acknowledged the pressures she faces. “I feel terrible for my wife because we go to church almost every Sunday, unless we’re on the road,” he said. He explained that although he helps with their children, Usha tends to feel the burden of keeping them quiet during the service. “Obviously, I help with the kids, but because I’m kind of the one going to church, she feels more responsibility to keep the kids quiet in the church.”Usha and JD Vance met at Yale Law School and married in Kentucky in 2014, with a Hindu priest presiding over a separate ceremony. They have three children. Usha has been pivotal in JD’s political career, helping him shape his thoughts on rural America’s social decline, which inspired his best-selling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy.

'Not giving you any if ... ': Trump at Coachella threatens to withhold wildfire aid from California,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/not-giving-you-any-if-trump-at-coachella-threatens-to-withhold-wildfire-aid-from-california/articleshow/114183838.cms,"Donald Trump has warned California Governor Gavin Newsom that the state could lose vital federal funding for wildfire relief unless action is taken to address ongoing water shortages and a controversial environmental policy. Speaking at a rally in Coachella, the former president criticised the state’s water management, claiming that policies intended to protect the endangered delta smelt fish were hurting farmers and leading to widespread drought conditions.Trump described California’s water crisis in stark terms, suggesting that vast swathes of land had become ""barren"" due to the rerouting of water into the Pacific Ocean to protect the fish. ""Millions and millions of gallons of water... gets pumped right into the Pacific Ocean,"" Trump said, lamenting the waste of water while farmers suffered from drought. He argued that, if elected, he would demand that Newsom reverse these policies, or risk losing federal assistance for the state’s frequent wildfires.Trump’s comments were delivered during a high-profile campaign stop in Coachella, a city in southern California, which he used as a platform to further criticise California’s Democratic leadership. He also made a thinly veiled threat to Newsom, saying, ""We’re not going to give you any of that fire money that we send you all the time for all the forest fires that you have"" unless changes were made.The former president's remarks targeted what he described as a ""mismanagement"" of California’s resources, blaming both state and federal policies for exacerbating the water shortage. Trump suggested that instead of prioritising the fish, the water should be used to support the state’s agricultural industry, which he described as the ""finest land in the country."" He claimed that millions of acres of farmland had been ruined due to the water rerouting and called for an overhaul of water policy.With key battlegrounds like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania at stake, Donald Trump spent Saturday night aiming to link Vice President Kamala Harris to her home state's challenges. Though he’s unlikely to win California, Trump used his Coachella visit to criticize the state’s issues, including homelessness, water shortages, and high costs. Referring to California as ""Paradise Lost,"" he warned, ""We won’t let Kamala Harris do to America what she did to California.""Despite the rhetoric, Trump’s visit to California is also a fundraising opportunity. Attendees paid up to $25,000 for a photo opportunity with the former president.In 2020, the former president lost California by a wide margin, but still received over 6 million votes—more than any previous GOP candidate. His support was strongest in rural counties, where he won by margins exceeding 70%, areas that traditionally lean conservative.","Donald Trump warned California Governor Gavin Newsom that the state could lose federal funding for wildfire relief unless action is taken to address water shortages and a controversial environmental policy.

'Pure racist identity politics': Barack Obama faces backlash for ‘lecturing’ Black men over lack of support for Kamala Harris,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pure-racist-identity-politics-barack-obama-faces-backlash-for-lecturing-black-men-over-lack-of-support-for-kamala-harris/articleshow/114180995.cms,"Former President Barack Obama is facing intense criticism after his October 10 remarks at a ""Black Voters for Harris"" event in Pittsburgh, where he expressed frustration with Black men supporting Donald Trump instead of Kamala Harris . Conservative commentator Benny Johnson led the charge, calling Obama’s comments “pure racist identity politics.” Johnson accused Obama of abandoning his previous message of unity, stating, “The magic is gone. This is the same guy who said, ‘There is not a white or Black America—there is only the United States of America!’ Now he’s running on racial supremacy? It’s grotesque.”Johnson's remarks were echoed by other conservative figures, including activist CJ Pearson, who took to social media to reaffirm his support for Trump. Pearson tweeted, “In 25 days, I’ll be joining millions of other young Black men and voting for Donald J. Trump! We don’t care what Barack Obama has to say about it.”Democratic Ohio state senator and former Bernie Sanders campaign advisor Nina Turner also criticized Obama, expressing her disappointment in his decision to single out Black men. Speaking on CNN, Turner said, “Why are Black men being lectured to? Why are Black men being belittled?” While she acknowledged her “love” for Obama, she emphasized that many Black men have valid reasons for voting differently, and those choices should be respected, even if others disagree. Turner urged Democrats not to lay the blame for lower support for Harris solely on Black men, stressing the importance of appealing to all voters and addressing their concerns.Obama's comments have sparked widespread debate, with many Black voters doubling down on their support for Trump. The controversy has also fueled further attacks from Trump himself, who mocked Obama and Harris on Truth Social. Trump claimed that Obama ""lacked enthusiasm"" for Harris and suggested the former president might even vote for him, stating, “Obama can’t stand Low IQ Kamala Harris, so he’ll be voting for President Trump in 2024!”As the 2024 election approaches, this backlash reflects broader concerns within the Democratic Party about energizing voters, particularly among Black men, a crucial demographic that could influence the election outcome.","Obama's comments have sparked widespread debate, with many Black voters doubling down on their support for Trump.

Former US President Donald Trump is leading over Vice President Kamala Harris when it comes to the question that who would better steer the country through the Ukraine and Middle East wars, according to a Wall Street Journal opinion poll of seven battleground states.According to a poll published on Friday, Harris and Trump witnessed neck-to-neck battle in the seven states that could decide the November presidential polls.Harris holds a narrow 2-point lead in Arizona, Georgia, and Michigan. Trump has a 6-point lead in Nevada and a 1-point lead in Pennsylvania. The candidates are tied in North Carolina and Wisconsin.The poll surveyed 600 registered voters in each state between September 28 and October 8. The margin of error is 4 percentage points for each state.A recent poll shows a very close race between the two candidates leading up to the Nov. 5 election. Americans are considering key issues, such as the economy, immigration, women's rights, and democratic values, as they decide whom to support.The tight results of the poll reflect similar findings in other surveys, indicating that the election could go either way. The country is deeply focused on these core issues while making their choice for the next leader.A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll revealed that former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are in a close national race. The poll shows Harris slightly ahead with 46% support, compared to Trump's 43%.Kamala Harris could secure a narrow majority in the Electoral College if she wins in states where she currently holds an advantage, according to a recent Wall Street Journal (WSJ) poll.The poll indicates that Donald Trump leads Harris in key areas. In seven swing states, 50% of respondents believe Trump is better equipped to manage Russia's war in Ukraine, compared to 39% for Harris. Similarly, Trump holds a lead over Harris, 48% to 33%, on handling the Israel-Hamas conflict.On economic issues and immigration, more voters support Trump. Conversely, Harris is favored over Trump on matters related to housing, healthcare, and empathy. The WSJ poll noted that more individuals feel Harris would do a better job when it comes to ""caring about people like them.""","Wall Street Journal poll shows Kamala Harris and Donald Trump neck-to-neck in seven battleground states.

A US army soldier has been sentenced to 14 years in prison for attempting to aid ISIS in planning attacks on American troops, the Department of Justice revealed. Cole Bridges, from Stow, Ohio, was found guilty of trying to support the terrorist group and conspiring to murder US soldiers, as reported by ABC News.24-year-old Bridges, who joined the Army in 2019, was a cavalry scout in the Third Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, Georgia. Before enlisting, he had started exploring jihadist propaganda online, expressing his support for ISIS on social media. By October 2020, he was communicating with an FBI undercover agent posing as an ISIS supporter in contact with fighters in the Middle East.“Bridges provided training and guidance to purported ISIS fighters who were planning attacks, including advice about potential targets in New York City,” the DOJ said. He also sent the FBI agent portions of a US Army training manual, believing it would assist ISIS in their operations.In December 2020, Bridges increased his involvement by supplying instructions on how to ambush US forces in the Middle East. He shared diagrams and tactics intended to help ISIS maximise the effectiveness of their attacks. Bridges even advised on how to rig buildings with explosives to target US Special Forces.In January 2021, Bridges recorded a video of himself in his US Army uniform, standing before an ISIS flag and making a gesture of support for the terrorist group. A week later, he sent another video in which he delivered a speech, using voice manipulation to conceal his identity.The FBI, along with several other military and intelligence agencies, was involved in the investigation. ""Our troops risk their lives for our country,” said Acting US attorney Audrey Strauss. “They should never face such peril at the hands of one of their own.""","Cole Bridges, 24, was a cavalry scout in the Third Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, Georgia.

American musician Landon Barker has come under fire for attending a party that mocked the serious sexual assault allegations against Sean “Diddy” Combs. The backlash follows Barker’s 21st birthday celebration at Nobu Malibu, after which he headed to a friend's birthday bash at a Los Angeles club.Clips from the event surfaced online, showing servers delivering bottles of baby oil adorned with flashing lights—a reference to the thousands of bottles seized from Diddy ’s homes earlier this year. While some partygoers laughed at the reference, the “bottle girls” serving the drinks appeared uncomfortable with the situation. One attendee captioned a video, “Baby oil show for the bday boy loolololol.”Although guests began passing the bottles around, Barker was not seen participating and seemed somewhat uneasy about the entire affair. In another clip, a DJ announced, “We’re getting really freaky tonight. We’re getting Diddy freaky tonight"", as quoted by PageSixDiddy is currently under investigation for his alleged “Freak Off” parties, where he reportedly subjected victims to physical, emotional, and verbal abuse during substance-fuelled sex parties.Videos from the party quickly went viral, sparking outrage among viewers who called the theme “insensitive and gross.” One user said, “Does anyone think it’s weird af for rich/famous people to make a potential sex trafficking party ring (idk the deets sorry) an ongoing joke at their own parties?” Another user commented, “I’ve never seen something so uncouth and unclassy in all my days.” A third added, “this is disrespectful to the victims.”Numerous accusations of sexual assault against Diddy have emerged in recent months. In one upcoming lawsuit, a woman alleges that Combs doused her with drug-infused oil before raping her alongside his bodyguard. Ariel Mitchell-Kidd, an attorney for several accusers, shared “graphic” details of her client’s alleged assault, claiming Diddy threatened her with a knife and used an oil-like substance believed to contain a date rape drug.54-year-old rapper Diddy was arrested last month on multiple charges, including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. He has pleaded not guilty to these charges, and his bail requests have been denied several times. He is expected to remain in custody in Brooklyn , NY, until his trial, which is scheduled to begin on May 5, 2025.","Landon Barker attended a party that mocked the serious sexual assault allegations against Sean ""Diddy"" Combs.

ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan government on Saturday warned to use force if jailed former prime minister Imran Khan 's party went ahead to hold a protest in Islamabad on the occasion of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) politic committee, comprising of its key members, decided to hold a protest at D-Chowk in the capital on Tuesday if the government failed to meet its demand to give the 72-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician access to his legal team and a physician, spokesman Zulfiqar Bukhari said.The authorities due to security concerns stopped all meetings with Khan, who has been incarcerated in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail , after the protest by the party over the last weekend.Defence Minister Khawaja Asif warned that the government would use ""full force"" to stop the PTI's planned protest on the occasion of the SCO summit .""The call for protest on October 15 is an attack on the integrity of the country. We will not allow [anyone] to damage the honour and reputation of the country. The state will use all of its power and resources to prevent the invasion of Islamabad,"" said Asif while speaking to the media in Sialkot.The politician also called for the courts to intervene and take notice of the matter. ""Do the courts not see what the PTI founder is doing with the integrity of the country? The actions of the judiciary today will determine their role in history,"" he said.Separately, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal condemned the protest call by terming it "" political terrorism "" which is aimed at maligning the country. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, he expressed disappointment at the timing of the protest.""Now there is no doubt that terrorism in Karachi and political terrorism protest calls are similar,"" the minister said, adding that both aimed to destabilise the country.Iqbal said the PTI was destroying the economy of the country and urged the party supporters to see the harm caused by their actions.""The PTI is attempting to undermine the government's economic recovery efforts. It's crucial to acknowledge the damage caused by these actions and consider the consequences of supporting policies that hinder Pakistan's growth and development,"" he said.The minister also stated that the country cannot afford destructive politics. ""Just because the PTI's leader is jailed, doesn't justify chaos,"" he said.Separately, federal minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit Baltistan Amir Muqam also strongly rejected the PTI's protest call. ""It is proof of anti-nationalism. There is no doubt that PTI's agenda seems to be anti-Pakistan because the party has declared the protest on this important occasion,"" he said.However, the PTI was in no mood to back off and Bukhari said the party was not against any foreign visit but ""this illegitimate government"" was trying to create a false case of normality when ""a former prime minister and leader of the largest party is illegally in prison (according to the UN) along with his wife"".""And to top it off, he has been banned to meet his legal team, doctor or family, which is against all human rights conventions and our constitution.

The victims belonged to various regions of Pakistan, as well as Afghanistan. “Most of the victims were from Pashtun-speaking regions within Balochistan. Three of the deceased and four of the injured are Afghan nationals,” Nasir added.Khairullah Nasir, the coal mine owner, said the attackers used hand grenades, rocket launchers, and other modern weapons in the attack. He added the attackers also set fire to “10 coal engines and machinery”.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but suspicion is likely to fall on the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which often targets civilians and security forces, accusing them of robbing Balochistan of its resources, including minerals and gas.The BLA had carried out multiple attacks in Aug that resulted in more than 50 killings, including that of 23 passengers, mostly from Punjab province, who were shot dead after being taken out of their vehicles. On Monday the group had claimed responsibility for a suicide bomber attack on a convoy of Chinese engineers near Karachi airport. Two Chinese citizens were killed in that attack.There are hundreds of Chinese working in the country, most of them involved in projects linked to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), part of Beijing’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Despite China’s repeated requests for Pakistan to bolster security, there has been a surge in attacks and unrest surrounding key CPEC projects.",Gunmen killed 20 miners and injured several others at a private coal mine in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province. The attack occurred amid heightened security concerns in Pakistan as it prepares to host the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit on Oct 15-16.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114157755,imgsize-1210563,width-400,resizemode-4/114157755.jpg"
