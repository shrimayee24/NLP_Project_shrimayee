Pakistan ‘handlers’ desperate after setbacks in J&K: DGP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-handlers-desperate-after-setbacks-in-jk-dgp/articleshow/111030580.cms,"Jammu: The four attacks on June 9, 11, and 12 in the three frontier districts of Reasi, Kathua, and Doda in Jammu division were desperate attempts by Pakistani “handlers” of the terrorists to sustain their operations following massive setbacks to the terrorism infrastructure in J&K, DGP RR Swain said Saturday.“The challenge is coming from across the border and they (terrorist handlers) have decided to keep the pot boiling,” Swain said. “They have noticed that the days of terrorism (in J&K) are numbered, given the major setback inflicted on the terrorist infrastructure in Kashmir. How can those, whose bread and butter runs on this, give it up so easily?”Swain, accompanied by Jammu zone ADG Anand Jain, made the statement after visiting Seda Sohal village in Kathua, where a villager was wounded, and two suspected Pakistani terrorists armed with an American M4 carbine and AK-17 rifle were killed in a 15-hour counteroffensive on June 11 and 12.“Sooner or later, terrorists active in J&K will be eliminated, but those involved in sheltering or providing support to these mercenaries would face exemplary punishment,” Swain said, warning people against providing any support to the terrorists.Swain highlighted the desperation of terrorists targeting unarmed people. “As we see, they (terrorists) are not in huge numbers. They are like rats but they exist. They have guns and they are using these on innocent people,” he said.Following the attacks, J&K police are battling a wave of rumours and panic among the public. Viral videos and images on social media, such as a video of a Bolero car with armed men and a photo of a man resembling a terrorist involved in the Reasi bus attack, have caused significant alarm. Police clarified that the vehicle carried Central Armed Police Force personnel and the man in the photo was a harmless local.Police released an advisory, asking people not to spread or believe rumours, but stay vigilant for suspicious activity. DGP Swain also urged people not to raise “false flags” and to verify information about the movement of terrorists before sharing it with security agencies.Authorities have detained over 50 locals for questioning regarding the June 9 ambush on a bus carrying pilgrims from Shiv Khori cave shrine to Vaishno Devi temple near Teryath village in Pouni area of Reasi district. The attack resulted in nine deaths and 41 injuries as the bus rolled down the hillside. Of those injured, 10 suffered gunshot wounds.“Fifteen critically injured patients were being treated at SMVD Narayana Hospital in Katra. Ten of them have been discharged. The other five are responding well to treatment,” an official said.Police have transferred Pouni SHO Parmodh Singh, citing negligence in acting on intelligence inputs prior to the June 9 attack.Security forces continued their search operations in Doda and Rajouri districts, with no suspects found so far. On June 12, a CRPF constable was killed in a sudden attack on a search team in Doda’s Gandoh area. Earlier that day, five Rashtriya Rifles troopers and a J&K police SPO were wounded in an attack near Chattergala mountain pass in the same district.","Four attacks on June 9, 11, and 12 in the three frontier districts of Reasi, Kathua, and Doda in Jammu division. DGP RR Swain said Pakistani “handlers’ of the terrorists’ operations were desperate attempts to sustain their operations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111030575,imgsize-3420,width-400,resizemode-4/111030575.jpg"
"How engineer-turned-cop checkmated reel hero, jailed top Kannada film star Darshan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-murder-how-engineer-turned-cop-checkmated-reel-hero/articleshow/110982273.cms,"Divya Spandana aka Ramya Lashes Kannada Star Darshan; 'No One Above Law'

Unravelling mystery

BENGALURU: When Sandalwood star Darshan was arrested , the million-dollar question asked in Karnataka 's political and police circles along with the public was who was instrumental in putting one of the biggest stars of Kannada film industry with a crazy fan base behind bars.As TOI started piecing together the murder puzzle involving 17 accused, including Darshan's girlfriend Pavithra Gowda , the role of one police officer stood out: deputy commissioner of police (west division) S Girish.""If not for this dynamic officer, the truth in the case would have got buried. Daring to pick a leading and influential film star on charges of murder requires courage,"" said a senior IPS officer, while commending Girish, assistant commissioner of police (Vijayanagar) Chandan Kumar, and also police commissioner B Dayananda who backed them. In fact, both Girish and Chandan have become 'real heroes' for many young cops on the verge of getting disillusioned by the system where dedication to do good barely fetches any brownie points.""Look at the sequence of events here: there was a murdered person and four guys who walked into station owning up the crime. The station-level officers believed the cooked-up story and chose to close the case. But Girish wasn't convinced,"" said sources. Usually, surrenders in murder cases happen in rowdy-related killings for security reasons. But the four who surrendered lacked consistency in their statements and, the victim was not an anti-social element. Girish, joined by Chandan , started grilling the four and learnt that the latter are just fall guys and are not connected to Renukaswamy. They were offered money to go to jail. Girish's next question was: ""Who offered money?"". The fall guys pointed to Vinay V, owner of a restaurant in RR Nagar, and police wasted no time in securing him. During questioning, Girish and Chandan learnt one of the accused had called a sub inspector in Kamakshipalya and inquired about the surrender process.Vinay, who is a close aide of Darshan, reportedly narrated how things went horribly wrong after Renukaswamy was picked up at the actor's behest and tortured in a godown in RR Nagar. He explained how Darshan was miffed with Renukaswamy's social media comments on his girlfriend Pavithra Gowda and mentioned the names of all those who were part of the torture squad. Police also retrieved CCTV footage of a Jeep Wrangler (which was used by Darshan) moving around along with a Scorpio near the place where the body was dumped.""Next, it was showtime as the 'Sultan of Sandalwood' had to be picked up. We thought it was not going to happen given the stardom and his proximity to politicians. But Girish sir proved us wrong,"" said a cop. While the aides were secured when they were returning from Mysuru, a discreet operation was launched to get Darshan, whose Sandalwood title is 'Challenging Star'.A team led by ACP Chandan Kumar landed at a star hotel in Mysuru where Darshan was staying in the wee hours of Tuesday. When Chandan walked up to the star in the hotel gym and told him to accompany the team, Darshan reportedly said: ""I know..everything got messed up. You carry on, I will come in my car.""Darshan's Rs 3-crore Land Rover Defender was parked at the hotel entrance. However, Chandan retorted: ""Will you come with us now or should you be....?"" Darshan, who had mouthed similar dialogues in his cop-themed movies earlier, realised the seriousness and got into the police jeep. He was brought to Bengaluru. Soon, the phone lines of Girish and the commissioner started buzzing. All moves to let the star walk free were checkmated as the TV channels started screaming about the arrest.""Both the actor and his well-wishers did not expect police to act at lightning speed, else the game would have changed,"" a cop claimed.Girish and Chandan were unavailable for comments.",Sandalwood star Darshan was arrested on charges of murder. Deputy commissioner of police (west division) S Girish played a key role in the case. Girish grilled four men who claimed to be part of the torture squad. The four men said they were offered money to go to jail.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110987727,imgsize-1629307,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/110987727.jpg"

He was accused of passing on secret information on BrahMos missiles to Pak intelligence operatives, who contacted him on social media in the guise of girls. His defence counsel has filed an appeal in high court. TOI has access to his case papers.Deo, however, told the court he did not come across any instance of Nishant tampering, sharing or misusing information from office computers even though his workstation had more classified information. The data allegedly found in his laptop was already in public domain, Deo told the court.Deo said he headed the warhead integration and mechanical department and did not receive any negative report about Nishant from the Intelligence Bureau or other security agencies. Nishant was also recommended for the young scientist award in 2018.However, NN Kumar, executive director (production) at the BrahMos unit, told the court that Nishant was not supposed to keep departmental information in his personal computer, which had a technical description of the missile - CK-310. This was highly classified information and a draft version for approval by technical specialists, he said on record.Responding to the defence lawyer, the investigating officer of Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) which arrested him in 2018, told the court that both Nishant and his wife were not inclined to Islamist ideology or involved in anti-national activity. ATS officer Pankaj Awasthi went on to say Nishant was not investigated for any assets disproportionate to his income and it's not true that he was not in possession of secret information during his training at the Hyderabad unit.","Nishant Agrawal worked in the missile assembly unit at Nagpur.

Meanwhile, the Pacific Northwest braces for unusually cold weather with the potential for late-season snow in the Rocky Mountains early next week.Forecasters warn of potential severe thunderstorms forming between the hot and cold fronts, which could lead to flash flooding between eastern Nebraska and northern Wisconsin on Saturday night. Parts of eastern Montana into North and South Dakota may also experience strong storms.Tropical moisture is expected to arrive at the central Gulf Coast within the next couple of days, bringing heavy rain by Monday morning, according to the National Weather Service.Forecasters noted that the threat of heavy rains in Florida is decreasing. However, thunderstorms that do develop could cause localized flooding due to saturated soil. Persistent storms recently flooded areas between Miami and Fort Lauderdale, with some regions experiencing up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rainfall.This damaging storm system coincided with the early June start of hurricane season. This year is predicted to be one of the most active in recent memory, with concerns that climate change is increasing the intensity of storms.With floodwaters receding in Florida, temperatures are rising across much of the southern U.S.In Atlanta, temperatures are expected to near 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) on Saturday and Sunday. The city has opened a cooling center to provide relief from the heat.'Family and Friends Field Day' has been postponed because of the high temperatures forecast.In El Paso, Texas, temperatures on Saturday are expected to hit around 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40.6 degrees Celsius). The National Weather Service has issued a heat advisory for the region through Monday morning. The city has opened five cooling centers that will operate daily until further notice.Last year, US recorded the most heat waves—abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days—since 1936. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the South and Southwest experienced the worst conditions on record last year.The upcoming heat wave will intensify on Sunday in the central part of the country before spreading eastward, said the National Weather Service. Some areas may see their daily temperature records broken due to the extreme heat. This heat wave could persist all week and into the weekend in many locations.While much of the country deals with the season's first hot weather stretch, parts of Montana are facing a different situation. They have been placed under winter storm watches with the possibility of wet snow starting Monday night.","After days of severe flooding, Florida and other states are now preparing for an intense heat wave.

In fact my husband, who also works in Kuwait, had visited the hospital and morgue there to look for him, but the authorities did not show him Denny's body.

""They were unable to inform us if Denny was present in that building or whether his name figured on the list of injured or dead. They were waiting for the Kuwaiti authorities to verify every detail.

Indian officials were visiting various hospitals to seek details, but their list would be anecdotal and subject to error.Daisy last met Denny in 2022, four years after he migrated to Kuwait. ""He visited friends in our childhood colony in Malwani -- he didn't like Virar. He was a compassionate gentleman. A teddy bear! To outsiders he may have seemed 'ghamandi' (arrogant).

NEW DELHI: Eight people, with atleast two of them being children, were shot and injured in a shooting incident at Brooklands Plaza Splash Pad park, a city-run water park near Detroit, Michigan. Initial reports from officials suggested that up to 10 people might have been wounded by gunshots but after contacting local hospitals, the number of confirmed victims was lowered by the authorities.According to Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard, the suspect exited a vehicle in front of the park around 5 pm and proceeded to fire approximately 28 shots, reloading the weapon multiple times in what police described as a ""random"" act of gun violence. While initial reports mentioned five people being shot, the exact number of casualties and the severity of their injuries remained unclear.The incident took place in Rochester Hills , situated about 30 miles (50 km) north of Detroit. Police recovered the firearm, identified as a 9mm semiautomatic Glock, at the location of the shooting.The suspect managed to flee the scene and remained at large late on Saturday night.

Big-name actors and musicians, from Robert De Niro to Barbara Streisand, have enticed donors to back Biden's re-election effort but there's little evidence they've energized their fans to come out in support of him. Meanwhile, a cadre of younger stars have yet to publicly back Biden in his race against Republican Donald Trump.Biden's team has struggled to make endorsements stick this year, especially among young people displeased with his handling of the Israel-Hamas war and other issues. The toxic nature of the nation's political debate may also be keeping celebrities on the sidelines. ""There is a difference between motivating donors and motivating voters,"" said Aubrey Montgomery, president of Democratic consulting firm Rittenhouse Political Partners.Arguably the two biggest US musicians - Beyonce, a vocal supporter of Obama, and Taylor Swift - have yet to endorse Biden this year. Swift has a massive following with younger voters that has grown as she toured at sold-out stadiums over the past year.Still, Biden's Hollywood support has helped him rack up a cash advantage against Trump - albeit one the former president has started to close. DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg is Biden's campaign co-chair and has leveraged his relationships into financial support. Director Steven Spielberg is helping with messaging efforts for the Democratic National Convention in August.Some celebrity interactions have fallen flat and failed to generate the viral moments Biden's campaign is seeking. De Niro's fiery denunciation of Trump outside the Manhattan courthouse where the Republican was on trial earned plaudits from Biden supporters but was mocked by others.Trump has also made inroads with celebrities, posting his first video to TikTok this month alongside Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White.Trump has already amassed more followers and likes than Biden's campaign account, which debuted in Feb.Trump in May held a rally in the Bronx, New York and invited rappers Sheff G and Sleepy Hallow in an attempt to connect with Black voters.

Do not be hesitant to make any kind of sacrifice,” he added.Justice Ahmad said Pakistan was currently “going through one of the longest periods of a civil government”, adding that the 2007 lawyers’ movement “closed the doors for martial law forever”.On Wednesday, the Lahore HC had summoned Punjab police chief Usman Anwar and other officials on a complaint from a presiding judge of an anti-terrorism court alleging harassment by intelligence and law enforcement agencies.On June 7, the HC registrar’s office had received a special report on district and sessions judge Muhammad Abbas wherein he had said that on May 25, the first day of his new charge, a message was conveyed to him that some ISI authority wanted to meet him in his chamber.Upon refusing to meet the said authority, Abbas alleged that ever since then he had been encountering various incidents, such as firing outside his court in Punjab’s Sargodha city and questioning of family members, among other things.Earlier, in March, six of the eight Islamabad HC judges had penned a startling letter to Supreme Court judges, regarding attempts by the ISI to pressure them through the abduction and torture of their relatives as well as secret surveillance inside their homes. Following the letter, judges from other HCs also acknowledged interference by spy agencies in judicial functions.It led the apex court to take suo motu notice of the matter, with high courts submitting their responses and recommendations as proceedings continued.","Several high court and lower court judges have complained that since May 9, 2023 Pakistan’s powerful authorities (army, ISI) have tried to pressure them using intimidatory tactics.

Muhammad Abbas made the allegation in a letter to Lahore high court chief justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan.

The judge has been hearing the cases against opposition leader in parliament Omar Ayub and other workers of Imran's PTI party in connection with the May 9, 2023 violence related to attacks on military installations in May last year. Ayub had alleged last week at a hearing that the judge was ""hostage"" of the intelligence agencies.

CJ Ahmad Khan summoned Punjab IGP Usman Anwar on Thursday and asked him why the roads leading to anti-terrorism court (Sargodha), some 200 km from Lahore, were closed by police when the judge refused to meet an ISI officer. The IGP replied: ""The roads were closed as the judge was facing serious threats"". The chief justice reserved his verdict on the alleged harassment of the ATC judge by the ISI.

In March, six judges of the Islamabad high court reached out to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) informing alleged intrusion of intelligence operatives in judicial matters.

Abbasi argued that the administrative orders issued by the court can neither be directly challenged nor indirectly, according to Geo News report.In his petition, Khan had sought the announcement of the district and sessions court's reserved verdict. He also requested the court to hear appeals in the said case.Meanwhile, Bushra Bibi had sought a decision on her plea seeking sentence suspension in the sessions court.

This allowed elected local representatives to continue the provision of services to their electorate. The local elections were subsequently held in August 2023 for 72 key positions in 21 districts.Commenting on the law and order situation in the province, the rights body alleged that over 160 policemen, 70 military personnel, 60 civilians, and more than 170 alleged militants were killed in dozens of targeted militant attacks and security operations in 2023.Attempting to address the situation, Pakistan forcibly deported over 1.5 million documented and 0.7 million undocumented Afghan refugees and migrants from the province following an announcement by the federal caretaker government.Shedding light on the financial issues faced by people, the rights body stated that hundreds of teachers, doctors, health workers, and sanitation workers protested against delays in payment of salaries and other dues in separate demonstrations across the province in 2023.The report also addressed the status of Public health and environmental crises which has been a major issue of concern to the citizens. The HRCP report stated, that at least 11 per cent of the population suffers from drug abuse, and around 40 fatalities from rains, flash floods, and dust storms occur in several districts.Persons with disabilities also remained deprived of essential accessibility measures in most buildings despite court orders, and 4.7 million children, 66 per cent of which included girls, remained out of school in 2023, the report added.According to HRCP's media monitoring for 2023, there were at least 20 cases of domestic violence, 72 cases of sexual violence, 49 'honour' killings, and 246 femicide-related murders that reportedly took place in the province.HRCP cited a report from the Digital Rights Foundation, which stated that 112 complaints related to cyber harassment and gender-based violence were reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.In January, women councilors from the Khyber district elected in the 2021 local government polls protested the denial of functional authority and development funds to help female constituents of their areas.While over 100 women contested in the polls and several were elected, they had neither been provided offices nor resources, unlike their male counterparts, thereby lowering their status in people's perceptions, the report added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), in its annual report, highlighted the precarious situation of human rights, law and order.

Some resistance fighters have been injured in these attacks, highlighting the junta's improved proficiency in utilizing UAVs.According to Min Zaw Oo, executive director of the Myanmar Institute for Peace and Security think-tank, the junta began procuring thousands of Chinese commercial UAVs at the start of the year, modifying them to carry locally-manufactured munitions. While the junta has not publicly addressed its recent use of UAVs, regime leader Min Aung Hlaing acknowledged last year that rebels had dropped over 25,000 bombs using drones during a major October offensive on military posts.Despite the junta's acquisition of armed CH-3 UAVs from China around 2013, resistance members report that the military is currently deploying multi-rotor commercial drones, including those designed for agriculture, in their latest sorties. The limited number of junta drones observed on the frontline suggests that the military has not yet deployed all of its newly procured aircraft.As the civil war continues, the resistance appears to have lost its early advantage of being the main fighting force using drones, according to analysts and rebel fighters. The junta's expanding UAV attack fleet is a welcome development for demoralized military forces relying on conscription to replenish shrinking frontline battalions.

""There's only one party which is active and occupies everything, does everything, gets to the elections in their way.""He added, ""They get their people elected in many different forms- proper candidates, dummy candidates, independent candidates - but all from the same party.""Law minister Anisul Huq said he completely disagreed with Yunus' comments, however.""It's not only I who disagree, but the people of the country will also disagree,"" Huq told Reuters by telephone, calling the remarks an ""insult"" to the people of the country.""Democracy is fully functional in this country,"" he added.Yunus, an economist who won the Nobel for his work on microcredit, was forced out of Grameen Bank in 2011 by Hasina's government, which said he had stayed on past the legal retirement age of 60.Hasina, 76, is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of the South Asian nation killed in an army coup in 1975, along with most of his family. She first became prime minister in 1996.As Bangladesh's longest-serving prime minister, Hasina has been credited with turning around the economy, though critics have also accused her of human rights violations and suppression of dissent.The US state department said January's elections were not free and fair while the British government's foreign office also condemned acts of ""intimidation and violence"".At the time, the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) denounced the exercise as a ""sham"" election, calling for its cancellation, Hasina's resignation and the formation of a non-party neutral government to hold a fresh one.Just before the election, a court in Bangladesh had sentenced Yunus to six months in prison for violations of labour law, which he denied.Although he is not in prison after securing bail in that case, Yunus faces more than 100 cases regarding the violations and graft accusations, which he dismissed as ""very flimsy, made-up stories"".Huq denied the accusations against Yunus were false, however, adding, ""He has gone to the highest court of the country, which found there was a case against him.""As an example, Huq cited taxes paid by Yunus after the supreme court ruled against him in a tax-evasion case, but declined comment on others as being sub-judice.Yunus' supporters say Hasina's government has sought to discredit him because he once considered setting up the political party, called ""Citizens' Power"".Hasina, who denies the contention, called Yunus a ""bloodsucker"" of the poor in 2011.""Is it a crime for a citizen to try to make a political party?"" Yunus asked, saying he dropped the idea of such a party after just 10 weeks, on realising that he was not suited to politics.Reviving a competitive political landscape in Bangladesh will be difficult, however, Yunus said.""Restarting will be very painful because we have brought it to a point where it has completely disappeared.""","Bangladesh has turned into a ""one-party"" state, Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus says.

COX'S BAZAR: At least three Rohingya refugees were killed, and seven others injured following a clash between rival militant groups struggling for control over relief camps in Bangladesh.Bangladesh shelters one million members of the stateless and persecuted Muslim community, the majority of whom arrived after a severe military crackdown in Myanmar in 2017.Most of these refugees live in vast, crowded camps. This year, there has been an increase in skirmishes between armed groups, partly due to the forced recruitment of refugees into Myanmar's civil war.On Monday, at least 100 members of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army ( ARSA ) attacked a group of refugees conducting a security patrol in a camp located in Cox's Bazar district, according to police.""They cut barbed-wire fence surrounding the camp and launched the attack on Rohingyas who were protecting the camp,"" said Mohammad Iqbal, a commanding officer of the Armed Police Battalion, which is tasked with maintaining security in the camps.""Three Rohingyas were killed and seven were injured. When police came to the spot, ARSA members also attacked police,"" he told AFP, adding that the victims had been variously shot and attacked with knives.A Rohingya community leader in the camps, speaking on condition of anonymity, has said the three slain men were members of the Rohingya Solidarity Organisation ( RSO ).""Murders and gunfights are occurring every day and night in the camp. ARSA killed three RSOs yesterday. No Rohingya are safe here. ARSA and RSO have made the camps hell for the Rohingya refugees,"" he said.Security within the Rohingya camps has been declining since April. Rival Rohingya groups have initiated campaigns to forcibly recruit young men and teenage boys to combat in Myanmar.About 1,500 Rohingya have been coerced from the camps to join the conflict, according to a confidential report circulated among UN agencies last month and viewed by AFP.Worried parents and Rohingya community leaders have organized patrol groups in the camps to prevent recruitment raids.At least 20 Rohingya have died this year in clashes between rival militant groups, as reported by the national daily Prothom Alo.Different Rohingya armed groups are individually gathering troops for Myanmar's military, responsible for their violent expulsion from the country in 2017.These groups argue that the Rohingya must ally with past enemies within the Myanmar army to confront a new threat.The recruits have been sent across the border to engage with the Arakan Army, which seeks greater autonomy in Myanmar's Rakhine state, also home to roughly 600,000 Rohingya.","Bangladesh shelters one million members of the stateless and persecuted Muslim community.
