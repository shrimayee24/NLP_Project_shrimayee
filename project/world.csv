BHOPAL: While the controversy over IAS officer Santosh Verma's remark against Brahmins at the Anusuchit Jati and Janjati Adhikari Evam Karmachari Sangh (AJAKS) State Convention in Bhopal on Nov 23 refuses to die down, another video of a woman IAS officer, Meenakshi Singh has surfaced in Madhya Pradesh in which she is heard advocating caste-based mindset in the same conference.In the video being circulated on social media, IAS Meenakshi Singh is heard saying ""jaativaadi hona aaj kal ke samay ki sabse badi maang hai. Aap dekhte honge savarna samaj ka surname dekh-dekh ke log unka pakshwad karte hain - yeh jaativad, yeh jaativaadi mansikta humare liye zaruri hai.

NEW DELHI: A Hindu youth was beaten to death by a mob and his body set on fire in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district on Thursday night following allegations of blasphemy, BBC Bangla reported, amid continuing unrest in the country and growing concerns over attacks on minorities and media institutions.The incident took place in the Dubalia Para area of Square Master Bari in Bhaluka upazila. Police identified the victim as Dipu Chandra Das, who worked at a local garment factory and lived in the area as a tenant.“A group of agitated people caught him and beat him up around 9 pm on Thursday for insulting the Prophet. Then they set his body on fire,” Ripon Mia, duty officer of Bhaluka police station, told BBC Bangla. He said the attackers tied the body to a tree before setting it ablaze.Police reached the spot after receiving information and brought the situation under control. The body was recovered and sent to the morgue of Mymensingh Medical College Hospital for autopsy. No case has been filed so far. “We are searching for his relatives.

Nitish Kumar's Hijab Shocker: BJP MP Giriraj Singh Defends Bihar CM's Act With 'Go To Hell' Remark

NEW DELHI: A woman doctor at the centre of the recent hijab row after Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar lifted her naqab during an event did not join duty on Saturday, officials confirmed to news agency PTI. They also reported no contact with her or the family members.Patna civil surgeon Avinash Kumar Singh confirmed that Nusrat Parveen had not reported for duty till 7 pm on Saturday, after which the “possibility window for the day” closed.“I have been informed that the last date of joining has been extended beyond December 20. It remains to be seen whether Parveen joins on Monday or not,” he said, without specifying the new deadline.The controversy erupted earlier this week during an appointment letter distribution programme at the chief minister’s secretariat in Patna. The video circulated widely on social media, capturing the moment Nitish Kumar questioned Parveen’s naqab when she came forward to receive her appointment letter along with other Ayush doctors.Also Read: Hijab row: SCBA issues 'strongest condemnation' over Nitish Kumar's act; seeks unconditional apology from Giriraj Singh, Sanjay Nishad Civil surgeon Singh said he was not aware of the reason for Parveen’s delay, as he “had no contact with her or the family members.”Vijay Kumar, a surgeon at Sabalpur PHC in Patna Sadar, where Parveen was supposed to join, also confirmed she had not reported for duty.“Around five-six people have joined today, and Parveen is not among them... Her name is in the list but we have not received her appointment letter from the civil surgeon office in Patna,” he said. As per protocol, candidates must first report to the civil surgeon’s office before joining their assigned workplace.Meanwhile, governor Arif Mohammad Khan expressed disappointment over the controversy.“It pains me to hear the word ‘dispute’ in this case. Can there be any row between a father and a daughter?” he asked.“What have you people made out of it? This man (Nitish Kumar) considers female students as his daughters,” he added while speaking to reporters in Patna.Earlier, Mahfoozur Rahman, principal of Government Tibbi College & Hospital (GTCH), where Parveen is a second-year student, also suggested the joining deadline had been extended “in this special case”.“Ayush doctor Nusrat Parveen has not joined yet, and there is no update on her future course of action,” Rahman said.According to him, the family wants to avoid media attention. “Her family said that they want to escape media coverage, and that the woman doctor will rethink whether to join or not,” he said.Rahman also dismissed rumours that the family had shifted to Kolkata. “They have themselves rubbished such false news reports,” he said, quoting Parveen’s husband as saying the family is not upset with Nitish Kumar or the government.He added that “the family is disappointed with the row stirred by the media.”Rahman said Parveen last attended college on December 17 or 18 and noted that she still has the option to either join duty or pursue higher education.","Nusrat Parveen had not reported for duty till 7 pm on Saturday, after which the “possibility window for the day’ closed.

Nitish Kumar's Hijab Shocker: BJP MP Giriraj Singh Defends Bihar CM's Act With 'Go To Hell' Remark

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) on Saturday issued a letter expressing its “strongest condemnation” of the recent incident in Bihar in which CM Nitish Kumar pulled down the hijab of a woman doctor during a public ceremony.The incident, which occurred on December 15 at the chief minister’s secretariat in Patna during the distribution of appointment letters to newly recruited AYUSH doctors, was captured in a video that quickly went viral.The clip showed Nitish questioning the woman’s naqab, saying “what is this?” and then attempting to remove it, leaving the doctor visibly flustered. Deputy chief minister Samrat Choudhary appeared to intervene to restrain him.In a post on X, RJD wrote: ""What has happened to Nitish ji? His mental state has now reached a completely pitiable condition, or has Nitish Babu become 100% Sanghi now?""In its letter, the SCBA condemned the Bihar CM’s action as an infringement on the woman’s autonomy, religious freedom and personal dignity.It stated, “Besides infringing on her autonomy, agency and religious freedom, it is a reflection of the depraving attitude against women in general.”The association also condemned “the vile comments made by union minister Giriraj Singh and Uttar Pradesh minister Sanjay Nishad,” saying such remarks further undermined the dignity of women. Signed by SCBA secretary Pragya Baghel, the letter demanded an unconditional apology from the chief minister and others involved.The controversy escalated after union minister Giriraj Singh defended Nitish, describing the incident as “nothing wrong” and framing it as a procedural act.Singh said it was up to the woman to refuse the government job or “go to hell” and argued that the act should not be seen through a religious lens.He drew parallels to other official procedures, stating, “When you go to get a passport, do you not show your face? When you go to the airport, do you not show your face? People talk about Pakistan and Englishtan, but this is India. In India, the rule of law prevails.”Similarly, Uttar Pradesh minister Sanjay Nishad’s remarks defending Bihar CM were widely criticised. Nishad initially supported Nitish’s action but later said his comments were misunderstood due to translation issues and offered to withdraw them if they had hurt sentiments.Despite this, opposition leaders continued to demand an unconditional apology from both ministers.",Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) condemns Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's act.

"9 years after NH-91 horror, UP court convicts 5 in mother-daughter gangrape, sentencing tomorrow",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/9-years-after-nh-91-horror-up-court-convicts-5-in-mother-daughter-gangrape-sentencing-tomorrow/articleshow/126098590.cms,"MEERUT/BULANDSHAHR: Nine years after the horrific gang rape of a woman and her young daughter on a stretch of National Highway-91 in Uttar Pradesh as male members of the family, tied and assaulted by robbers, begged and cried for mercy, a special Pocso court in Bulandshahr convicted five men for the gruesome crime on Saturday.The assault had not just shocked the nation, but also forced the then-state govt to tweak road rules, even posting 'snipers' on trees to curb crimes along the key stretch.Sentencing of the five convicts is scheduled to be done on Monday.The incident happened on July 29, 2016, when the family's vehicle was intercepted near a village, while they were travelling to Shahjahanpur from Noida.The gang held the entire family hostage at gunpoint and assaulted the mother-daughter after dragging them to a nearby field.Despite the crime scene's proximity to a local police station, the cops there failed to respond on time. The family reported that initial calls to emergency services went unanswered, and the investigation only gained momentum after the father contacted a personal acquaintance in the Noida police department.Providing details, additional district govt counsel (ADGC) Varun Kaushik, said, ""Forensic evidence, including semen traces matching the convicts, played a crucial role.""""The court convicted Zuber alias Parvez (35), Mohd Sajid (37) both from Kannauj, and Dharamveer Singh (36), Sunil Kumar (35), Naresh Kumar (46), from Farrukhabad district. Saleem Bawaria (45) - the gang's kingpin - died during the court trial in Dec 2019,"" he added.The ADGC added that ""all the convicts were unable to secure bail and remained in jail since the incident."" ""Their bail was even rejected by the Supreme Court,"" he said. An FIR was registered on the afternoon of July 30, that year, under sections 394, 395, 397 (aggravated forms of robbery and dacoity), 376-D (gangrape), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC, and 5/6 of the Pocso Act.""The next day, police arrested Mohd Riyazuddin, Mohd Shahwez and Jabar Singh from Haryana. They were, however, later given clean chit by CBI and let-off,"" Kaushik said. The gravity of the incident led to a CBI probe ordered by the Allahabad high court and resulted in the suspension of several high-ranking police officers for ""negligence"".Notably, the apex court also reprimanded then-UP cabinet minister Azam Khan for calling the incident a ""political conspiracy by the Opposition"". Khan later tendered an apology in court. TOI's extensive coverage at that time exposed the vulnerability of the travellers on desolate stretches of the UP highways, some of them without adequate road lights.Twenty-five witnesses provided testimony during the trial. Of the 11 individuals implicated, the legal outcomes varied - two suspects died in police encounters, one passed away in custody due to illness and three were acquitted for lack of evidence. Saturday's conviction by additional district and sessions judge-III, Omprakash Verma, concluded the lengthy legal process.","A court in Bulandshahr convicted five men for the gruesome crime on Saturday.

Inside a plastic grocery bag pressed close to his chest lay the body of his four-month-old son. No ambulance was ready. No money remained. So he turned towards a public bus and began a 70km journey home.Dimba Chataumba, a villager from Baljori - a remote settlement under Noamundi PS limits in West Singhbhum district of southern Jharkhand - had come to Chaibasa sadar hospital hoping doctors could keep his infant alive. Instead, by Friday evening, he was forced to carry Krishna's body back himself after the govt-run facility said it could not arrange a vehicle in time.Hospital staff told him to wait more than two hours. Their only working ambulance was far away, near Manoharpur, roughly 80km from Chaibasa, district headquarters of West Singhbhum. Chataumba nodded. Then he disappeared.He returned quietly, bought a thick grocery bag from a nearby shop, placed the 3.6kg body of his son inside and left without informing anyone, choosing a public bus over an uncertain wait.Krishna had been admitted a day earlier, suffering from high fever, loose motion and breathing trouble.Blood tests confirmed malaria. Doctors said the child was anaemic and critically ill, needing ventilator support beyond the hospital's capacity.""The infant was anaemic and was in a critical condition. He required ventilation support. Thursday evening, we asked the boy's father to take him to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College & Hospital in Jamshedpur for further treatment,"" said district civil surgeon Dr Bharti Gorreti Minz.Jamshedpur, 70km from Chaibasa, has advanced referral facilities. Reaching it, though, costs money Chataumba didn't have. He pleaded for treatment to continue at sadar hospital. He told doctors he could not afford transport. Oxygen and medicines were given, but by Friday afternoon, Krishna died.Grief quickly turned into urgency. Chataumba asked for a shav vahan, a hearse ambulance, to carry the body home. With only Rs 100 in his pocket, hiring a private vehicle was impossible. Officials asked him to wait. What happened next unfolded without witnesses.""Nobody at the paediatric ward, nor the hospital guard, was informed by the father about carrying his son's body in the bag. He quietly left the hospital. We all were in the dark,"" Minz added.By the time Chataumba reached home, neighbours gathered as he recounted the ordeal, his words spreading shock across the village.An inquiry ordered by the administration later concluded that the father had left hastily. Chaibasa sub-divisional officer Sandeep Anurag Topno's report said Chataumba could not be contacted when the ambulance eventually arrived because he did not own a cellphone.Scenes like this continue to surface across India, laying bare deep gaps in public healthcare and transport for the poor. In Sept 2024, a Maharashtra couple walked through a muddy forest path with the bodies of their two sons after fever claimed their lives and no vehicle came. In June 2025, a tribal man in Nashik travelled 90km by bus with his newborn's body in a bag after a civil hospital refused an ambulance.Jharkhand has seen its own share of such moments. This year, HC sought explanations from the state after videos showed a man carrying his sick wife on his shoulder when no ambulance arrived. The memory of Odisha's Dana Majhi - who walked 12km with his wife's body in 2016 - still lingers, a case that drew global outrage.Yet, on Friday evening in Chaibasa, those lessons felt distant. Baljori village lies amid forested hills and mining belts near the Odisha border, where public transport is sparse and private vehicles expensive. For families like Chataumba's, a hospital visit already means debt. A referral to a city hospital can mean surrender.","Dimba Chataumba, a villager from Baljori - a remote settlement under Noamundi PS limits in West Singhbhum district of southern Jharkhand.

Other staff members noticed Singh's negligence in time, preventing the spirit from reaching the child.College principal R C Gupta told TOI Saturday that Avinash Singh was inebriated at the time and had a history of reporting for duty in a drunken state. ""He was removed immediately after the matter came to my notice. We have instructed ward in-charges and heads of departments to take action against such staff,"" Gupta said.Another ward boy, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that ""Singh was removed twice earlier by ward in-charge over negligent work but would return as the principal was not cognisant of it."" He said that Singh got into a verbal spat with the child's parents after the incident, following which staff members intervened and took him away. No police case was registered as the parents did not file a complaint.This was the second incident involving misconduct by outsourced staff at the medical college in a week. Last week, two female ward attendants and a ward boy were terminated after they were caught on CCTV assaulting a deaf and mute woman in the 'lawaris' (unclaimed) ward.

NEW DELHI: Holding that the Constitution itself is put at risk if the balance between power of the State and dignity of the individual is disturbed, Supreme Court held that govt cannot deny renewal of passport to an accused or convict when the court concerned has given no-objection to get it renewed with a condition that prior permission would be needed to go abroad.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and A G Masih said where criminal cases are pending then a ""no objection certificate"" or permission from criminal court may override an adverse police report for renewal of passport. It quashed order of passport authority rejecting renewal of passport to one Mahesh Kumar Agrawal who is convicted in one case in Delhi and being prosecuted by NIA court in Ranchi in coal mining case. He challenged his conviction in Delhi HC and his appeal is pending. He got bail in both cases and got no-objection from both DelhI HC and Ranchi court for renewal.Allowing his plea, the bench said, ""Liberty, in our constitutional scheme, is not a gift of the State but its first obligation. Freedom of a citizen to move, to travel, to pursue livelihood and opportunity, subject to law, is an essential part of guarantee under Article 21 of the Constitution. The State may, where statute so provides, regulate or restrain that freedom in interests of justice, security or public order but such restraint must be narrowly confined to what is necessary, proportionate to the object sought to be achieved, and clearly anchored in law,"" it said.It said the law permits court to allow renewal of passport while retaining complete control over each instance of foreign travel by insisting on its prior approval as had been done in the present case. ""In our view, once criminal courts, with full knowledge of the pending proceedings, consciously allowed renewal subject to the condition that the appellant shall not travel abroad without their permission and, in case of NIA court, required redeposit of renewed passport, underlying concern of Section 6(2)(f) stood adequately addressed under judicial supervision,"" it said. Section 6(2)(f) talks about denying passport when criminal case is pending.""In the present case, both criminal courts have adopted a different but equally legitimate method of control by allowing renewal while reserving to themselves the power to regulate each instance of foreign travel. That method satisfies the statutory concern of securing the accused's presence..."" it said.""Denial of renewal of a passport does not operate in a vacuum. This court has repeatedly held in a catena of judgements that right to travel abroad and right to hold a passport are facets of right to personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution. Any restriction on that right must be fair, just and reasonable, and must bear a rational nexus with a legitimate purpose,"" it said.","Justices Vikram Nath and A G Masih said where criminal cases are pending then a ""no objection certificate"" or permission from criminal court may override an adverse police report.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court said criminal antecedents and gravity of offence are vital factors while deciding bail plea and quashed bail granted by Patna HC to five accused who had indulged in armed assault and were habitual offenders with multiple cases pending against them.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said the HC failing to refer to criminal antecedents of the accused demonstrates ""a non-application of mind"" and the order deserved to be quashed.""It is well-settled that, as a general rule, bail once granted should not ordinarily be cancelled. However, in cases where the offences are of a serious and heinous nature, capable of creating fear and apprehension in society at large due to the impact they may have, and where continued presence of the accused on bail is likely to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice or impede the course of trial, courts are not powerless to cancel the bail. In such circumstances, the jurisdiction conferred under law may and ought to be exercised to cancel bail in order to uphold the ends of justice and rule of law. The present case is clearly of this nature, involving a premeditated, armed, and violent attack, which renders the exercise of such jurisdiction both necessary and imperative,"" the bench said.Challenging the HC order, state govt had contended that HC failed to examine the criminal antecedents of the accused, seriousness & gravity of the offences alleged, and the planned manner in which the crime was executed on failure of the informant to pay extortion money.""The material on record prima facie establishes that the allegations of prior extortion demands, threats to life, and concerted action of multiple assailants, point towards a systematic abuse of criminal force to assert dominance and settle scores. Such offences strike at the very core of public order and the rule of law and, therefore, warrant a cautious and circumspect exercise of judicial discretion before directing release of accused on bail, particularly when trial is underway and the possibility of influencing witnesses tampering with evidence or otherwise obstructing the course of justice cannot be ruled out,"" it said.It said SC has consistently held that criminal antecedents constitute a vital and determinative factor which ought not to be ignored while considering an application for grant of bail, as they reflect the conduct, character, and behavioural pattern of the accused, and bear directly upon the likelihood of misuse of liberty.""Apparent omission on part of HC in failing to advert to the antecedents of the accused respondents demonstrates a non-application of mind to a germane and determinative consideration, thereby rendering the exercise of discretion manifestly arbitrary. The impugned orders, having been passed without balancing liberty of the accused against interests of society and administration of criminal justice, stand vitiated in law,"" it said.",Supreme Court said criminal antecedents and gravity of offence are vital factors while deciding bail plea.

Congress altered demography of Assam for poll gains: PM Modi



GUWAHATI: PM Modi transformed his Guwahati rally on Saturday into a fierce political offensive against Congress, accusing it of ""committing a sin"" by preparing to join hands with the Muslim League and the British in a pre-Independence conspiracy to make Assam a part of what would later become ""East Pakistan"".Modi said Congress had conspired to erase Assam's identity and the conspiracy was not just for a few years. ""The roots of this sin of Congress are connected to before Independence. At the time when the Muslim League and the British were together preparing the ground for India's partition...""At the time when Muslim League and British rule were together preparing the ground for India’s partition, at that time a plan was made to make Assam a part of undivided Bengal or East Pakistan (sic). Congress was going to become part of the conspiracy,” PM Modi said.Modi’s remarks came a day after Bangladesh was engulfed in violent protests following the assassination of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi, triggering fears of fresh migration ahead of elections due in early 2026. Amid recent campaigns in Bangladesh by several groups seeking a “Greater Bangladesh” by including Assam and the northeast, analysts warn this unrest could spill over into India’s northeast, reviving old anxieties about infiltration and demographic change.By invoking East Pakistan and linking it to present-day turmoil across the border, Modi sharpened his message of vigilance against infiltration, political commentators said.Addressing a public rally after inaugurating India’s first nature-themed airport, named after Assam’s first post-Independence CM, Gopinath Bordoloi of Congress, Modi said, “Then Bardoloi stood up against his own party. He opposed this conspiracy to destroy Assam’s identity and saved Assam from being separated from the country.” He unveiled an imposing 80-foot statue of Bordoloi, describing him as Assam’s saviour.Modi claimed that though Bordoloi had saved Assam before Independence, Congress later resumed “anti-Assam and anti-national work”. “To increase its vote bank, Congress gave free rein to infiltrators of its vote bank in Bengal and Assam. The demography here has changed. These infiltrators have encroached upon our forests. They have encroached upon our land. The result of this is that the security and identity of entire Assam has been put at stake,” he claimed.The PM praised CM Himanta Biswa Sarma’s govt for working to free Assam’s resources from illegal encroachment, while asserting that the Centre had taken strict steps to curb infiltration. “Their identification is also being done,” he said, claiming that “Congress and INDI alliance people have openly descended on an anti-national agenda.” He added that even SC had spoken about removing infiltrators, “but these people (Congress) are making statements in defence of infiltrators. ”Modi said Election Commission’s SIR of electoral rolls was meant to ensure fair elections. But, he claimed, “these people (Congress) are facing problems in every corner of the country. Such people will not protect the interests of Assamese brothers and sisters. These people will allow someone else to occupy your land and forests. Their anti-national mentality can create violence of the old era.”Modi told the crowd: “We have to protect Assam, for whose integrity people like Bordoloi sacrificed everything in their lives. We have to keep defeating Congress’s conspiracies at every moment, at every step.”","Modi says Congress had conspired to erase Assam's identity and the conspiracy was not just for a few years.

Nitish Kumar's Hijab Shocker: BJP MP Giriraj Singh Defends Bihar CM's Act With 'Go To Hell' Remark

What was the controversy?

Opposition calls it 'cheap mentality':

NEW DELHI: Union minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh on Thursday defended Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar after a video showing him pulling down the hijab of a woman doctor during an official programme went viral. He claimed that there was “nothing wrong” in the chief minister’s action.On reportedly being asked about the woman at the centre of the row may refuse to take up the government job, Singh said it was up to the woman to refuse the government job or “go to hell”. He added that Kumar “has done nothing wrong” and framed the incident as a procedural act.“Whether she refuses the job or goes to hell, that is her choice,” Singh said.Defending Nitish, the union minister argued that the incident should not be viewed through a religious lens and described the chief minister’s action as that of a guardian verifying identity at an official function.“If someone is going to collect an appointment letter, should they not show their face? Is this some Islamic country? Nitish Kumar acted as a guardian,” Singh said.Drawing parallels with other official procedures, he added, “When you go to get a passport, do you not show your face? When you go to the airport, do you not show your face? People talk about Pakistan and Englishtan, but this is India.In India, the rule of law prevails.”The controversy stems from an incident earlier this week during an appointment letter distribution programme for newly recruited AYUSH doctors at the chief minister’s residence in Patna.A video shared by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on X shows Nitish Kumar on stage alongside deputy chief minister Samrat Choudhary and health minister Mangal Pandey.When a woman doctor, identified as Nusrat Parveen, approached the stage with her face covered by a hijab, Kumar appeared displeased, remarked “What is this?”, bent down and pulled the veil down.The woman was seen visibly flustered as an official moved her aside, while Samrat Choudhary appeared to tug at Kumar’s sleeve, seemingly trying to restrain him.According to the Chief Minister’s Office, the programme involved the distribution of appointment letters to 1,283 AYUSH doctors, including Ayurveda, Homeopathy and Unani practitioners, with only 10 receiving letters in person and the rest online.The incident and union minister's comments drew sharp criticism from opposition parties. Congress MP Tariq Anwar called Singh’s statement indicative of a “cheap mentality” and condemned Kumar’s action as “shameful and saddening”.""These are third-rate people, they have a cheap mindset. They dont understand that our country is secular. Everyone is free to practice their religion. What Nitish Kumar has done is shameful and saddening,"" Anwar said.Reacting to Singh's statement, J&K CM Omar Abdullah said: ""This is exactly what we can expect from the BJP. If it had been a Hindu woman from Rajasthan or Haryana, wearing a veil, and I had removed it, would the BJP have said the same thing? Imagine the uproar if a Muslim leader had removed the veil of a Hindu woman. But now, because it was a Muslim woman doctor, the BJP's reaction is different. What else can we expect from them?""Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Iltija Mufti also expressed outrage, saying such remarks and acts are deeply offensive to Muslim women.""Only phenyl will work to clean this man's filthy mouth. You dare not touch the hijabs & naqabs of our Muslim mothers and sisters. Otherwise we Muslim women will set you right by teaching you a lesson you and your ilk will remember for all times to come,"" she said in a post on X.NCP (SP) MP Fauzia Khan also hit out at both leaders.""It is very saddening that responsible people do such acts, this will send a wrong message in the world. It is a personal decision of a woman as to how much she covers up and removing the veil is akin to disrobing a woman. He (Kumar) should have given a pubic apology but instead of that they are saying that what happened was right,"" she said.RJD MP Manoj Jha said the visuals were “unsettling” and raised serious concerns, adding that such actions did not send a good message from the state’s top constitutional authority.The Congress also came down heavily on the Bihar chief minister, calling the act “shameless” and “vile” and demanding his resignation.Congress MP Sukhdeo Bhagat said the incident was condemnable and violated traditions and faith, while the party said publicly humiliating a woman at a government event raised questions about women’s safety and dignity.""This does not seem appropriate from any angle. Treating a woman like this is condemnable,” Bhagat said.Leaders from other opposition parties echoed similar concerns. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi said no one, regardless of position, had the right to publicly humiliate an adult woman for her choice of attire, stressing that equality must be rooted in consent. The AAP also criticised the incident, warning against normalising control over women’s choices.Amid the outrage, the BJP sought to counter the criticism by sharing an old video of former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot removing a woman’s ghoonghat, arguing that the opposition was being selective in its outrage. BJP leaders also accused opposition parties of politicising the issue for electoral gains.The row further escalated after Uttar Pradesh minister Sanjay Nishad made controversial remarks defending Kumar, which were widely criticised as misogynistic.Nishad later said his comments were misunderstood due to translation issues and offered to withdraw them if they had hurt sentiments, even as opposition parties continued to demand an unconditional apology.",Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar pulled down the hijab of a woman doctor during an official programme.

KARWAR: A GPS-tagged migratory seagull on Karwar beach on Wednesday sparked curiosity and suspicion in equal measure among locals, before forest officials clarified that the device was part of a scientific study tracking migration pattern of birds.The exhausted bird fitted with the tracking device was rescued by forest department officials after locals noticed the unusual attachment and raised an alert.The bird, which appeared tired and had sustained minor injuries, was brought to the forest department office for examination. Officials confirmed that the device was a GPS tracker used for scientific research to study migration patterns.Forest department sources said they contacted the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka (WNPS), which confirmed that it had tagged the bird as part of a long-term migration study. Although the tracker was manufactured in China — a common source for such equipment — authorities ruled out any surveillance or espionage angle.A section of the media went on an overdive speculating that the tracker may be a spy camera as the INS Kadamba naval base was nearby. However, officials clarified that the device contained no camera.Data retrieved from the tracker indicated that the seagull had flown over 10,000 km, including across Arctic regions, before reaching Karwar.After the GPS unit was safely removed, the bird was moved to the forest department office.Police and intelligence officials visited the beach to verify details and confirmed that the incident posed no security concern.Authorities urged the public not to spread misinformation, stressing that GPS tagging is a standard practice in wildlife research to study migratory routes of avians.",A migratory seagull with a GPS tracker on Karwar beach sparked curiosity and suspicion among locals.

Newly released documents tied to Jeffrey Epstein have put a spotlight on previously unseen photos of the late convicted sex offender with a host of high-profile figures, including legendary popstar Michael Jackson , musician Mick Jagger , and former US President Bill Clinton.The images were made public by the US Justice Department on Friday as part of a long-awaited government disclosure.The US Department of Justice published thousands of heavily redacted pages under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a law passed by Congress and signed by US President Donald Trump in November.Jeffrey Epstein’s released files and contact lists include the name of Michael Jackson, and court documents show the pop star was at Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion at least once, according to a deposition. There is no evidence that Jackson was involved in Epstein’s crimes, and inclusion in the records reflects social overlap, not guilt.The Epstein files include Mick Jagger’s name in contact lists and social records tied to Epstein’s network, placing the Rolling Stones frontman among many celebrities whose details appeared in the documents. There is no public evidence linking Jagger to criminal activity or involvement in Epstein’s offences.Newly released Epstein documents contain photos and records showing former President Bill Clinton in social settings with Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, including images of Clinton in a pool and at events with others. Clinton has denied knowledge of Epstein’s crimes, and no charges have been brought against him.The earlier releases also contained photographs of several prominent public figures, including billionaire Bill Gates, filmmaker Woody Allen, philosopher Noam Chomsky, Google co-founder Sergey Brin and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon.

Nicole Lunders and Greg Biffle’s relationship, divorce, and life as Emma Elizabeth’s mother

Nicole Lunders is known as the ex-wife of NASCAR driver Gregory Jack Biffle and the mother of their daughter, Emma Elizabeth Biffle. In recent days, Nicole has been in the public eye again after reports confirmed that Emma Elizabeth died in a tragic plane crash in North Carolina. Officials are still investigating what caused the crash, and many questions remain unanswered.The plane went down near Statesville Regional Airport in December 2025. Local authorities confirmed that everyone on board died after the aircraft caught fire while attempting to land. The names of the victims were not released right away. Later, family friends told Associated Press and ABC News that Emma Elizabeth was among those killed. Reports also said the flight was connected to Greg Biffle’s family. As the investigation continues, attention has turned to Nicole Lunders, not for her past marriage, but because she has lost her only child in a sudden and heartbreaking way.Nicole Lunders and Gregory Jack Biffle were together for many years before getting married in 2007. During Greg’s rise in NASCAR, Nicole stayed mostly out of the spotlight. She was often seen supporting him at races but kept her personal life private.The couple welcomed Emma Elizabeth during their marriage. Even after Nicole Lunders and Greg Biffle separated in 2015 and finalized their divorce in 2016, both remained closely involved in raising their daughter. Friends have often said Emma was the center of both parents’ lives.After the divorce, Nicole focused on being a full-time mother. She avoided public attention and did not stay active on social media. Emma, however, was sometimes seen with her father at racing events and special ceremonies. In September 2025, Emma attended an event where Greg Biffle was honored at the North Carolina Auto Racing Hall of Fame, showing they shared a strong bond.That is why the plane crash has shocked so many people. Authorities, including the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board, are still working to find out what went wrong. Officials have asked the public for patience as the investigation moves forward.For Nicole Lunders, the focus now is not public attention, but grief. She is being remembered as a devoted mother facing an unimaginable loss, as the racing world and fans continue to mourn young Emma Elizabeth.Also Read: Greg Biffle Net Worth In 2025: NASCAR Star, Career, Family, Income And Death In Plane Crash","Nicole Lunders is the ex-wife of NASCAR driver Gregory Jack Biffle.

The US Justice Department has begun releasing a large batch of previously unseen files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, following lengthy efforts to make government records about the case public.The release comes under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a law passed by Congress and signed by US President Donald Trump in November. It required unclassified documents in the department’s possession to be made public by December 19, 2025.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News on Friday that the Justice Department would publish “several hundred thousand” pages of documents on the deadline, but he said that the full set will not be released at once and additional batches are expected over the coming weeks.Blanche said the department needed extra time to protect victim identities and ensure that names and identifying details are appropriately redacted.The newly released documents include a wide range of investigative material generated over nearly two decades of federal scrutiny into Epstein’s conduct and network. These materials may comprise photographs, internal law enforcement communications, evidence inventories, and other records related to multiple aspects of the Epstein investigation, according to CBS news.In addition to Friday's Justice Department release, lawmakers and committees have previously made thousands of pages of materials public through subpoenas and voluntary disclosures. In September, the House Oversight Committee released tens of thousands of pages of files ranging from court records and flight logs to videos of Epstein’s jail cell before his death. The earlier revelations included previously available material as well as a new context for Epstein’s relationships with powerful figures. No formal accusations have been made against political leaders whose names appear in the records.The Epstein Files Transparency Act also requires the government to publish a list of all politically exposed persons and government officials named in the records, along with explanations for any redactions and withheld portions, within 15 days of the documents’ release.Despite the milestone release, the Justice Department is facing criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who say the department is violating the law by not releasing all of the files by the legal deadline, which was 30 days fromt he president's signing.","US Justice Department has begun releasing a large batch of previously unseen files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Megyn Kelly reacts after Ben Shapiro and Bari Weiss target Candace Owens at AmericaFest





Megyn Kelly did not hold back after journalist Bari Weiss praised Ben Shapiro for attacking Candace Owens at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest. The event began on December 18, and it quickly turned tense when Shapiro took the stage. His speech focused on what he called dangerous conspiracy talk linked to false claims around Charlie Kirk ’s death.After Ben Shapiro’s speech, Bari Weiss shared her support on X, calling his remarks strong and necessary. That post triggered a sharp response from Megyn Kelly. Kelly said both Weiss and Shapiro spoke without knowing what had been happening privately for months. She also said people should have checked with Turning Point USA and Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s wife, before making public attacks. The clash has now turned into a loud public fight between major conservative media figures, with Candace Owens also firing back online.Ben Shapiro used his TPUSA AmFest speech to call out Candace Owens by name. He accused her of spreading conspiracy theories and demanding answers without proof. Speaking from the stage, Shapiro said:“We also have a duty to provide you with evidence of the claims that we make. Emotive accusations, conspiracy theories, and just casting questions.That’s lazy and stupid and misleading… So when Candace Owens says, ‘I don’t know, no, but I know,’ that is retarded. And we are all more retarded for having heard it.”Shapiro also said people with large platforms must speak up. He added:“If Candace Owens decides to spend every day since the murder of Charlie Kirk casting aspersions at TPUSA… then we as people with a microphone have a moral obligation to call that out by name.”Soon after the speech, Bari Weiss posted on X and shared an adapted version of Ben Shapiro’s remarks published by The Free Press. She wrote:“Only Cowards Tolerate Conspiracy Theorists. @benshapiro delivered a barnburner tonight @TPUSA.”That post drew an immediate response from Megyn Kelly, who said Weiss and Shapiro acted without full context. Megyn Kelly replied on X:“@benshapiro & @bariweiss in a joint attack on yours truly (their ‘friend’) tonight w/o a damn clue what has been going on behind the scenes for months. Prob should have checked w/ @TPUSA & @MrsErikaKirk first. I’m embarrassed for them.”Megyn Kelly later said on her podcast that Erika Kirk had asked her to help quietly fix the situation. She said she had been working behind the scenes to ease tensions between Candace Owens and Erika Kirk, and felt the public attacks made things worse.Candace Owens also responded online after the speech. In one X post, she wrote that it was “beyond obvious” Ben Shapiro was “fearful” about something related to the controversy.Also Read: “I Don’t Have Concrete Evidence”: Candace Owens Admits Lack Of Proof As Piers Morgan Presses On Charlie Kirk Assassination",Bari Weiss praised Ben Shapiro for attacking Candace Owens at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest.

Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Saturday he hopes the massive free-trade deal between South American bloc Mercosur and the European Union will be signed in January. Protests on Friday by European farmers and opposition from France and Italy threatened to quash an agreement that has been under negotiation for more than 26 years.Top EU officials had hoped to sign the EU-Mercosur deal in Brazil this weekend, but instead, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Friday after a tense EU summit that the signature will be delayed ''a few extra weeks to address some issues with member states.''Lula told other South American leaders attending a summit in the Brazilian city of Foz do Iguacu, on the three-way border with fellow Mercosur members Argentina and Paraguay, that the meeting was only taking place because European negotiators had earlier signaled they would eventually sign the deal, and that did not happen. He added the delay was due to Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni requesting more time.Von der Leyen needs the backing of at least two-thirds of EU nations to secure the deal. Italy's opposition would give France enough votes to veto von der Leyen's signature.""Without political will and courage from leaders, it won't be possible to finish a negotiation that has dragged for 26 years,"" Lula, who spoke to Meloni on the phone on Friday and received a letter from EU leadership aiming for a deal in January, told his peers.""Meanwhile, Mercosur will continue to work with other partners.""""The world is eager to make deals with Mercosur,"" the Brazilian president added. ""Many countries want that. And we certainly we will be able to finish the deals that were not finished during my presidency (of the bloc, due in the end of December).""If signed, the trade deal would cover a market of 780 million people and a quarter of the globe's gross domestic product, and progressively remove duties on almost all goods traded between the two blocs.France has led opposition to the deal between the EU and the five active Mercosur countries - Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday at an EU summit he wouldn't commit to supporting the deal next month either.Macron added he has been in discussions with Italian, Polish, Belgian, Austrian and Irish colleagues among others about delaying it to address farmers' concerns.Lula argued Macron alone can't block an agreement.""Let's hope that things happen for the good of our Mercosur, multilateralism and the development of our countries,"" the Brazilian president said.",Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Saturday he hopes the massive free-trade deal between South American bloc Mercosur and the European Union will be signed in January.

Seven Held In Hindu Man’s Lynching in Bangladesh As Yunus Faces Scrutiny Over Minority Safety





Ten people have been arrested in connection with the brutal killing of a 27-year-old Hindu man in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district, as authorities face mounting pressure to act against mob violence amid wider unrest in the country.Seven suspects were detained by the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), while three others were arrested by the police for their alleged role in the murder of Dipu Chandra Das, who was a garment worker.The arrests were confirmed by Muhammad Yunus, Chief Adviser of Bangladesh’s interim government, in a post on X.“10 arrested in the Mymensingh Hindu Youth Beating Murder Case,” Yunus said, referring to the incident that took place in Bhaluka, a sub-district of Mymensingh.Those taken into custody by RAB have been identified as Md. Limon Sarkar (19), Md. Tarek Hossain (19), Md. Manik Mia (20), Ershad Ali (39), Nijum Uddin (20), Alomgir Hossain (38) and Md. Miraj Hossain Akon (46), as per ANI. Police separately arrested Md. Azmol Hasan Sagir (26), Md. Shahin Mia (19) and Md. Nazmul.Security forces carried out coordinated operations at multiple locations to track down the suspects.'RAB and police conducted operations in various locations to apprehend the aforementioned individuals', Yunus added.Dipu Chandra Das was beaten to death by a mob on the night of December 18 over accusations of blasphemy. His body was later set on fire, triggering outrage across the country.The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council strongly condemned the killing, describing it as a deliberate act that threatened communal harmony.In a statement cited by news agency ANI, the minority rights body said the attackers beat Das to death around 9 pm before hanging his body from a tree and setting it alight. The council demanded swift arrests and exemplary punishment for those responsible.Police officials quoted by BBC Bangla said that the victim was assaulted in the Dubalia Para area of Bhaluka and that officers recovered the body and sent it to Mymensingh Medical College Hospital for post-mortem examination.The killing took place against the backdrop of nationwide tension following the death of student leader Sharif Osman Hadi, whose shooting earlier this month sparked protests and violence in several parts of Bangladesh.The interim government has condemned the lynching in strong terms, stating there was “no space for such violence in new Bangladesh” and warning that the perpetrators would not be spared, as per ANI.","Dipu Chandra Das was beaten to death by a mob on the night of December 18 over accusations of blasphemy.

What happened during Clavicular’s Miami IRL stream and police response





Clavicular was live on camera when everything suddenly changed. The 19-year-old Kick streamer was walking in Miami on December 18, 2025, when police rushed in and stopped him mid-stream. Within seconds, officers surrounded Clavicular and his group, shouting loud commands as viewers watched live. The video spread fast across social media and shocked many fans.Police were seen yelling, “Put your hands up!.. Get down on the ground!” Clavicular and his friends followed every order. They laid flat on the sidewalk, face down, with their hands behind their backs. The stream kept running during the entire moment.Clavicular is known online for his controversial talks about looksmaxxing and his links to the growing “black pill” community. His content often brings strong reactions. This time, it brought police to the scene.The incident ended with Clavicular being detained for about 45 minutes before being released. No charges related to violence were announced at the scene.As police questioned the group, the cameraman tried to explain what was happening.He told officers clearly, “We’re live streamers… They called the police on us, we’re live streaming.”Clavicular also spoke while still on the ground and added, “This happens every week.”This was not his first police encounter on stream. Similar moments have appeared on his Kick streams since early November 2025. On December 3, 2025, Clavicular and fellow streamer Edmatthews were also stopped by police during a live broadcast.After officers understood the situation better, Clavicular and his group were asked to sit against a wall. During that time, Clavicular asked about his damaged clothes, saying, “Would they reimburse, for like, us ruining our clothes?”An officer replied simply, “No.”Police later advised Clavicular to inform a nearby station before doing IRL streams in public again. One officer said, “You guys can go talk to the station, so at least we can be aware that you guys are in the area.”Once background checks were done and no threat was found, the group was allowed to leave.After the viral incident, another clip also spread online showing Clavicular threatening to break a stream sniper’s jaw while using a homophobic slur during a live stream. That moment added more backlash to an already heated situation.Also Read: What Happened Between Jourdin Pauline And Tylil James?

Candace Owens shares witness claim linking Erika Kirk and Brian Harpole to Fort Huachuca meeting





Fresh claims shared by Candace Owens have stirred heavy debate online. On her podcast Candace Owens spoke about a witness who says he saw Erika Kirk in a restricted place just hours before the reported killing of Charlie Kirk . Candace Owens said these claims come from a former special forces operative. The man, identified only as Mitch, said he saw Erika Kirk with Charlie Kirk’s head of security at a military base in Arizona. Owens made it clear this was an eyewitness account shared on her show, not an official finding.Right now, there is no confirmation from police or federal agencies backing these claims. Still, the story has drawn attention because of who is involved and the serious nature of what is being alleged. Candace Owens said she no longer trusts the official version of events and wants answers about what really happened in the final hours before Charlie Kirk’s death.During the podcast, Candace Owens interviewed Mitch, who said he was at Fort Huachuca in early September. He explained that he went there to “get records” and noticed an unusual military presence that day.Mitch said he was questioned by officials and told to leave the area for at least 24 hours.He added that at the time, he did not think much about the people he saw. Everything changed, he claimed, after news broke about Charlie Kirk.“I don’t know these people from TP USA, never been associated with it,” Mitch told Owens. “I could recognise Charlie Kirk, probably.”He continued, “But what I started seeing come across and got more familiar once I saw a picture of somebody in a ponytail with those eyes, that was that person. They were there, and the head of security [Brian Harpole] was one of the people walking out with the congressman.”Mitch said he is “95 to 99 per cent” sure about what he saw. He claimed his confidence comes from strong facial recognition skills. “There’s a picture with Erika Kirk with a ponytail from her past, that person matches who I saw at Fort Huachuca in the lobby,” he said.Candace Owens said these claims raise serious questions about why key people linked to Turning Point USA would be at a secure military site that night. She stressed that she is seeking truth, not politics, and believes the public deserves clear answers.Also Read: “Envious Of Charlie Kirk”: Candace Owens Fires Back At Ben Shapiro As AmFest Clash Shakes Conservative Media","Candace Owens shares witness claim linking Erika Kirk and Brian Harpole to Fort Huachuca meeting.

UAE transport update

What to expect next?





The UAE is experiencing unstable weather today as a low-pressure system continues to affect much of the country, bringing heavy rain, thunderstorms, lightning and hail in some areas. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has forecast this pattern to persist through Friday, with scattered showers and varying rain intensity across emirates including Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and the northern regions. Winds are moderate to strong at times, stirring dust and reducing visibility, while sea conditions remain rough along the coast.This unsettled weather follows days of rain and cloud activity, and residents should expect spotty downpours and wet conditions throughout the day.Authorities across the UAE have issued strong safety advisories, urging residents to remain cautious:The National Centre of Meteorology advised people to avoid outdoor activities during thunderstorms and stay updated through official channels.Police departments in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah warned motorists to reduce speed, maintain safe distances and avoid flooded roads, stressing that water-logged streets can be deceptively dangerous.Civil Defence teams across several emirates remain on standby, responding to weather-related incidents and assisting affected areas.Residents were also advised to stay away from wadis and low-lying areas, where fast-moving water poses serious risks.If you were planning to commute between emirates today, you might need to rethink your schedule. Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has officially suspended intercity bus services to Sharjah and Ajman until further notice. This decision was made to keep passengers safe as visibility drops and water accumulates on major highways. While public buses within Dubai are still operating, the RTA warns that commuters should expect significant delays.The disruption isn't just on the roads; it has reached the skies as well. At Dubai International (DXB), Emirates and flydubai have been forced to cancel or reschedule multiple flights due to the unstable conditions. Passengers are being urged to check their flight status online before even heading to the airport, as access roads are also facing heavy traffic and localized flooding. In Abu Dhabi, Zayed International Airport is also on high alert, with authorities advising travelers to allow extra time for their journey.According to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM), the umbrella-weather isn't going away just yet. The unstable conditions are expected to persist throughout Saturday, December 20, particularly in coastal, northern, and eastern areas. Winds could reach speeds of up to 50 km/h, and the seas will remain rough, making any maritime activity dangerous.As the UAE navigates this stormy period, the sense of community resilience is high. Authorities continue to provide minute-by-minute updates on social media, reminding everyone that while the rain may be heavy, the safety measures in place are even stronger.","The UAE is experiencing unstable weather today as a low-pressure system continues to affect much of the country.

Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in the Bangladesh protest and ousting of Sheikh Hasina, died on Thursday in Singapore (local time), according to a press release from Singapore's ministry of foreign affairs. He had been after fighting for his life for six days following a shooting in Dhaka.Sharif Osman Hadi, a spokesperson for Inqilab Monchoan, was shot earlier this month. He was initially taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital and later shifted to Evercare Hospital as his condition deteriorated. Last Saturday, Hadi was airlifted to Singapore for advanced treatment, but he succumbed to his injuries on Thursday night.Sharif Osman Hadi was a key leader of the July Uprising that played a central role in toppling the previous Awami League government. He served as the spokesperson of Inqilab Mancha, a political platform that emerged from the protest movement, and was being considered a candidate for the upcoming general elections.Hadi was shot in the head on December 12 while campaigning in central Dhaka. Investigators said an assailant on a motorcycle opened fire at him as he travelled in a battery-powered rickshaw to conduct electioneering, reported Dhaka Tribune.He was first taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where doctors carried out emergency brain surgery, describing his condition as “extremely critical.”He was later shifted to Evercare Hospital and airlifted to Singapore on December 15 for advanced treatment. Doctors said the bullet had caused severe damage to the brain stem. After battling for life for six days, Hadi succumbed to his injuries at a Singapore hospital, PTI reported.With regards to the shooting, he was targeted while travelling in a battery-run auto-rickshaw in Dhaka’s Paltan area.Hadi’s death triggered widespread protests in Dhaka, with hundreds of students and supporters gathering at Shahbagh intersection chanting slogans in his name, as per PTI.Student groups and political outfits linked to last year’s protest movement accused the authorities of failing to ensure security and demanded swift arrests of those responsible.Protests later escalated, with reports of vandalism at media offices in the capital and attacks on properties linked to political figures in different parts of the country. The interim government appealed for calm, urging citizens to allow law enforcement agencies to conduct investigations professionally.Yunus described Hadi’s killing as an “irreparable loss” to Bangladesh’s democratic landscape and called for unity, restraint and patience. “No one will be able to halt this nation’s democratic progress through fear, terror or bloodshed,” he said, adding that advancing democracy would be the true tribute to Sharif Osman Hadi, reported ANI.","Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in the Bangladesh protest and ousting of Sheikh Hasina, died on Thursday in Singapore.

US President Donald Trump’s ally Elise Stefanik has opted to leave politics and said she will no longer run for New York governor.House Republican Conference chair and fourth-ranking member in the House of Representatives, Stefanik said on Friday she was bowing out of politics to spend more time with family.She added that she would halt the gubernatorial campaign, that was launched in November, and would not seek re-election to Congress.When her current term representing New York’s upstate 21st congressional district expires in January 2027, she will have served 12 years in office on Capitol Hill.Stefanik’s decision followed a holiday advertising blitz by her Republican rival in the gubernatorial primary, Nassau County executive and fellow Trump ally Bruce Blakeman, who paid to air campaign ads on Fox News in West Palm Beach, Florida, the home of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence.President Donald Trump has previously expressed consternation at having to choose between two allies to challenge New York’s incumbent Democratic Governor, Kathy Hochul, next November. “They’re two fantastic people, and I always hate it when two very good friends of mine are running, and I hope there’s not a lot of damage done,” the New York Times quoted him as telling reporters recently.While voicing confidence that she would have “overwhelmingly won” that race, Stefanik said in her announcement, “it is not an effective use of our time or your generous resources to spend the first half of next year in an unnecessary and protracted Republican primary, especially in a challenging state like New York.”Stefanik went on to say that throughout her time in Congress, her “most important title is Mom.” “I believe that being a parent is life’s greatest gift and greatest responsibility,” she wrote. “I have thought deeply about this and I know that as a mother, I will feel profound regret if I don’t further focus on my young son’s safety, growth, and happiness - particularly at his tender age.”Shortly after Stefanik bowed out, President Trump acknowledged her announcement on his Truth Social platform, writing “Elise is a tremendous talent, regardless of what she does. She will have GREAT success, and I am with her all the way!”Stefanik, the youngest woman ever elected to the House in 2014, moved sharply to the right after Trump’s first presidential victory in 2016. She has led efforts to expose how elite U.S. colleges, including New York’s Columbia University, responded to campus protests over the Gaza war. At the start of Trump’s second term in January 2025 he nominated her as Ambassador to the United Nations, but he withdrew her name amid concerns about Republicans’ narrow House majority.While Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won New York by a comfortable 12-point margin over Trump in 2024, the state shifted more towards Trump than any other in the nation from 2020 to 2024. Despite this, Democrats dominated several high-profile elections in November, including in New York City and nearby New Jersey.Stefanik’s district is not seen as competitive in next year’s midterm elections, when Democrats will seek to take control of the House. Incumbent Presidents’ parties typically lose House seats in midterm elections.Hochul, 67, became Governor in 2021 after then-Governor Andrew Cuomo resigned amid sexual harassment allegations and won a full four-year term in 2022.","US President Donald Trump’s ally Elise Stefanik has opted to leave politics and said she will no longer run for New York governor.

"H-1B, H-4 visa delays: Immigration lawyer shares advice for workers, families and spouses waiting to return; 'They cannot risk...'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/h-1b-h-4-visa-delays-immigration-lawyer-shares-advice-for-workers-families-and-spouses-waiting-to-return-they-cannot-risk-/articleshow/126098410.cms,"



Applicants for H-1B and H-4 visas are facing unexpected and prolonged delays in US visa interview appointments, with some now being pushed back by more than a year, according to immigration lawyer Gnanamookan Senthurjothi, as reported by The American Bazaar.Senthurjothi said that several applicants who had originally secured interview slots for January 2026 at US consulates were recently notified that their appointments had been rescheduled to February, March and April 2027 instead. In some cases, the change was made without any clear or formal explanation from consular posts.“The worrying part is that many applicants were not properly informed,” Senthurjothi told The American Bazaar. “They logged into the system only to discover that their interview dates had been pushed back by over a year.”The delays are affecting both H-1B skilled workers and H-4 dependents, including spouses and children. Many of those impacted are professionals already employed in the United States who need visa stamping to travel or re-enter the country. Others are families waiting to reunite after long periods apart.According to Senthurjothi, the backlog appears to be linked to staffing shortages at US embassies, increased security checks and a continued surge in visa demand.He said that the US government has acknowledged processing delays, but the lack of transparency has left applicants confused.“These delays have serious real-world consequences,” he said. “People are postponing travel, family emergencies and even career opportunities because they cannot risk being stuck outside the US.”Senthurjothi advised applicants to regularly monitor their appointment portals for earlier slots, use emergency appointment requests where eligible and avoid non-essential international travel if their visa status is uncertain. He also urged employers to be flexible with affected workers.The issue will stretch into extended delays and could disrupt US businesses that rely heavily on skilled foreign workers. Many are calling on the US State Department to expand interview capacity and provide clearer communication to applicants.","H-1B and H-4 visa applicants are facing unexpected and prolonged delays in US visa interview appointments.

Watch: Trump goes off-topic and talks about wife Melania's undergarments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-trump-goes-off-topic-and-talks-about-wife-melanias-undergarments/articleshow/126098330.cms,"



Donald Trump sparked laughter and surprise at a North Carolina rally on Friday when he went off-topic to talk about his wife and first lady Melania's undergarments.The MAGA chief was addressing inflation and efforts to lower drug prices ahead of the 2026 midterm elections in Rocky Mount, but turned to a personal topic about the FBI raid on his Mar-a-Lago resort in 2022.“They went into my wife's closet ... they looked at her drawers,” Trump said, referring to Melania.The GOP leader then said: “Her undergarments, sometimes referred to as panties, are folded perfect, wrapped. They're, like, so perfect.” He even joked about her maintenance habits, saying, “I think that she steams them.”The comments came in the context of the 2022 Mar-a-Lago raid. The operation was conducted as part of a criminal investigation after the National Archives and Records Administration reported that 15 boxes of presidential documents had been removed from the property at the end of Trump’s first term. The FBI aimed to find evidence related to potential obstruction of justice, mishandling of classified records, and possible violations of the Espionage Act. Among the materials recovered were 11 sets of classified documents, including some marked ""top secret,"" intended for secure government facilities only.Trump has faced a lot of legal setbacks over the past decade. In June 2023, he was indicted by a federal grand jury over alleged mishandling of classified documents. He pleaded not guilty and while additional counts were later added, the case was dismissed in July 2024. Other high-profile legal issues include investigations into alleged hush money payments during the 2016 presidential campaign, and his role in attempts to overturn the 2020 election and the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot.","The MAGA chief was addressing inflation and efforts to lower drug prices ahead of the 2026 midterm elections in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.

JD Vance wanted to release the Epstein files in 2021. What happened now?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-wanted-to-release-the-epstein-files-in-2021-what-happened-now/articleshow/126098324.cms,"Social media response to Vance's 2021 Epstein post

Damn, this post didn't age well.

You’re not gonna believe this

So? What happened bro?

any updates on this, champ

Hey man, it’s not looking so good right now





A 2021 tweet from US vice president JD Vance has gone viral, in which he asked: “What possible interest would the US government have in keeping Epstein’s clients secret?”The X post resurfaced again as thousands of pages of newly released Epstein files were made public by the House Oversight Committee this week.Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna responded to the viral post, writing: “Great question, JD Vance. Have you asked Attorney General Pam Bondi? She is brazenly breaking the law Rep Thomas Massie and I led and insulting MAGA voters' intelligence with excessive redactions and concealment.”Representative Thomas Massie also joined the conversation, commenting: “I miss this version of JD Vance.”The newly released files include a large collection of legal documents, photos, and correspondence related to convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his wealthy, influential associates. The documents feature images of big figures and correspondence with Epstein, but many are heavily redacted, and some remain without context or dates. Both Khanna and Massie played key roles in pressing the Justice Department to release the materials. They pressured the GOP administration and utilised the public’s right to transparency and accountability in the investigation of Epstein’s dirty network. Their oversight helped ensure that the files, which had been withheld for years, are now available for public and congressional review.MAGA leader JD Vance has spoken out in defence of the Trump administration’s handling of the Epstein files, saying there is “nothing to hide” and that Trump instructed the Justice Department to release all relevant information. He criticised previous Democratic administrations, especially Biden's, for failing to act on Epstein’s activities and questioned why legacy media is only being active recently.",JD Vance tweeted in 2021 asking: “What possible interest would the US government have in keeping Epstein’s clients secret?” The post resurfaced again as thousands of pages of newly released Epstein files were made public by the House Oversight Committee this week.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126098324,imgsize-1028537,width-400,resizemode-4/126098324.jpg"

'Bill Clinton skinny dipping with a pedophile': Newly released Epstein files reveal shocking images – See photos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bill-clinton-skinny-dipping-with-a-pedophile-newly-released-epstein-files-reveal-shocking-images-see-photos/articleshow/126098106.cms,"



Newly released files linked to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have again implicated former US President Bill Clinton, after photographs surfaced showing him nearly naked in a hot tub with an unidentified woman, who social media speculates could be Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's close associate.The images were made public as part of a Justice Department document release, which was ordered last month to ensure transparency, with a 30-day deadline for a full disclosure. However, the revelation was only partial, with most information redacted or blacked out.The files were released on Friday to meet a congressionally mandated deadline, including numerous photographs and records involving Clinton (79). One image shows him reclining in a hot tub with a woman at his waist. Others place him alongside Epstein on private planes, at overseas destinations and at high-profile events and parties.“This is his reckoning. I mean, if you turn on CNN, that’s what they are talking about. I’ve gotten a million texts about it,” Clinton's former aide said, according to AOL.He added: “People are like, ‘I can’t believe he was in a hot tub.Who’s the woman in there?’ She’s at, you know, body level. I mean, it’s, like, unbelievable. It’s just shocking.”The records show Clinton travelling with Epstein to the UK, Brunei, Thailand and Morocco. He is also pictured attending the 2002 wedding of Moroccan King Mohammed VI, as well as touring Winston Churchill’s Second World War war room in London. In another image, Clinton is seen swimming with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking crimes in a low-security prison.The former aide said that Clinton's life is now ruined: “[Clinton] is Prince Andrew… He’s kinda done. He was already done before, but now he’s even more so. People have to be brought to justice for if they did these things, there’s no question about it.”The document dump was criticised by Democrats who said that the Justice Department failed to fully comply with the transparency law. The files contain relatively few references to President Donald Trump, who was once friendly with Epstein before cutting ties around 2004. The DOJ has denied any allegations of removing or editing names, saying they did so to protect the privacy of victims and not to hide the names of predators.Clinton’s office denied any wrongdoing and accused political opponents of deflecting attention. “The White House hasn’t been hiding these files for months only to dump them late on a Friday to protect Bill Clinton,” a Clinton spokesperson said.Lawmakers who authored the Epstein Transparency Act, including Ro Khanna, Shri Thanedar and Thomas Massie, said the Justice Department failed to release all required materials and is breaking the law.Far-right activist Laura Loomer posted on X: ""It’s pretty rich how the Democrats falsely accused President Trump of being a pedophile, only for the Trump DOJ to release Epstein files that show Bill Clinton skinny dipping with a pedophile in the pedo’s pool""Clinton was not the only one featured in the newly released files. There were also pictures of Michael Jackson, Kevin Spacey, Mick Jagger, and Diana Ross with Epstein.","Newly released files linked to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have again implicated former US President Bill Clinton.

New Epstein BOMB: Maxwell Caught Smiling On Cam As Andrew Lies Across Women's Laps | Report

Authorities ignored her warnings for decades



Alleged ties to Trump and Clinton

Experts call for probe into FBI’s handling







A woman in 1996 had filed a complaint with the FBI regarding Jeffrey Epstein ’s interest in “child pornography,” however, the agency never publicly acknowledged her report. Maria Farmer has long said she contacted federal investigators nearly a decade before authorities began a full investigation into the convicted sex offender’s abuse. Some observers even questioned her account.Farmer, talking to the New York Times, claimed the complaint detailed Epstein stealing photographs and negatives of her younger sisters, who were 16 and 12 at the time. Some images were reportedly taken for her personal artwork.Farmer’s sister, Annie Farmer, had also testified during Maxwell’s trial, recounting her experiences at Epstein’s New Mexico ranch. She stated that Epstein got into bed with her at age 16 to “cuddle” and that Maxwell once massaged her bare chest.According to the handwritten FBI report, Epstein also asked Farmer to take photographs of young girls at swimming pools and threatened to “burn her house down” if she told anyone. Farmer later cut ties with Epstein after alleging sexual assault by him and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell Farmer has said she contacted federal investigators nearly a decade before a broader investigation into Epstein began. “I've waited 30 years,” she said, as quoted by The New York Times.“I can't believe it. They can't call me a liar anymore.”Farmer expressed relief at being “vindicated” but said the government’s failure to act caused lasting harm, adding, “They should be ashamed. They harmed all of these little girls.”Farmer also urged authorities to investigate Epstein’s connections to powerful figures, including former Presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump.Also Read: Epstein files drop: Spoiler alert - it’s mostly ████████ She recalled seeing Trump at Epstein’s New York office in 1995, stating he stared at her legs while she wore running shorts. Epstein reportedly intervened, telling Trump, “No, no. She's not here for you.” Farmer later heard Trump remark that he thought she was 16 years old.Brad Edwards, a lawyer representing many Epstein victims, criticized the government for ignoring Farmer’s 1996 complaint, stating that the case could have stopped Epstein decades earlier.“There should be a full-fledged investigation into every government employee who knew about this document and allowed a narrative to be publicized that it did not exist,” Edwards said.An internal Justice Department review released in 2020 did not reference Farmer’s complaint. In the newly released FBI report, her name is redacted and she is described only as a professional artist hired by Epstein to acquire artwork.","Maria Farmer has long said she contacted federal investigators nearly a decade before authorities began a full investigation into the convicted sex offender’s abuse.
