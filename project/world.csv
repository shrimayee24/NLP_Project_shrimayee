They are also caused by the displacement of rocks due to groundwater utilisation and when air contained in small cavities inside the earth escapes through tube wells, KSDMA said.It said a decision has been taken to subject the site to a geophysical survey to understand the structure of the area more accurately and for that the Kozhikode NIT has been contacted by the KSDMA.Regarding the damage suffered by some buildings due to the vibrations, it said the same was due to ""age and structural weakness"".Nearly 300 people were moved to safety after the ""explosion-like"" sounds accompanied by tremors were heard in Anakkallu on Tuesday night.

We will fight for your freedom. Under my administration, we will also strengthen our great partnership with India and my good friend, Prime Minister Modi.""Trump also condemned attacks on minorities in Bangladesh , including Hindus and Christians, amidst the political turmoil following the resignation of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. ""I strongly condemn the barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians, and other minorities who are getting attacked and looted by mobs in Bangladesh, which remains in a total state of chaos,"" Trump said.Hasina's resignation on August 5, which was spurred by widespread protests against a contentious government job quota system, has left the country in disarray, prompting the establishment of a caretaker government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.This is for the first time that Trump has addressed the crisis in Bangladesh, where reports indicate that hundreds of Hindus were killed during protests in July and August. He contrasted his approach to that of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he accused of ignoring the plight of Hindus both globally and domestically.""It would have never happened on my watch. Kamala and Joe have ignored Hindus across the world and in America. They have been a disaster from Israel to Ukraine to our own Southern Border,"" Trump said, adding, ""but we will Make America Strong Again and bring back Peace through Strength!""Trump also critiqued Biden and Harris on economic matters, claiming, ""Kamala Harris will destroy your small businesses with more regulations and higher taxes. By contrast, I cut taxes, cut regulations, unleashed American energy, and built the greatest economy in history. We will do it again, bigger and better than ever before—and we will Make America Great Again.""He also extended his Diwali wishes, saying, ""Also, Happy Diwali to All. I hope the Festival of Lights leads to the Victory of Good over Evil.""Trump's outreach to Hindu Americans was strategic, aiming to consolidate support within this community while also appealing to broader concerns about global stability and economic resilience.","Former US President Donald Trump on Thursday extended Diwali greetings and pledged to safeguard the interests of Hindu Americans.

They either go to the Governor or the Prime Minister. I would like to ask the BJP MP, during the tenure, was the State Waqf Department locked? Were they doing anti-national activities that they are claiming to be now? Do they have any common sense, how the law works, how the procedure works?...These people are just out to play politics with it,"" Priyank Kharge, who is the son of congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge said, according to news agency ANI.Earlier, as a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee currently reviewing amendments to the Waqf Act, Tejasvi Surya said, ""There have been multiple press conferences and videos in the public domain where the minister himself has admitted that these Waqf adalats are being conducted under the chief Minister's instructions.""Surya flagged that farmers from various districts have reported abrupt and unauthorized transfers of their land ownership to the Waqf Board. ""Over the last few days, farmers from many districts across Karnataka have been raising alarms that, without any notice from revenue authorities or adherence to due legal processes, changes have been made to their land records, RTCs, mutation registers, and other documents. Ownership has, in many cases, been suddenly transferred to the Waqf, causing serious panic among thousands of farmers across the state.""However, this was not the first the BJP MP had raised this. On Wednesday, he wrote to Waqf Bill JPC Chairman Jagdambika Pal, asking him to visit Vijayapura district where the Muslim body has claimed ownership of 1500 acres of farmers' lands. Surya said he met a delegation of farmers from the Vijayapura district, who have cultivated their lands for nearly a century and maintain records dating back to the 1920s and 1930s.""In recent months, however, many of them have been served notices declaring their lands as Waqf property, without any accompanying evidence or explanation,"" he said in his letter.The BJP MP said the scale of these claims is substantial, with nearly 1,500 acres being designated as Waqf property in their village alone. ""The farmers claim that apart from being served notices, changes have been made in the RTC, pahani and mutation registers for some of the land parcels without following the due process of law.""""I, therefore, request that you invite the delegation of affected farmers to appear as witnesses before the Committee. Their testimony will provide valuable insights into the local implications of the proposed amendments and the pressing issues faced by the farming community in this regard,"" he said.After the controversy over the notices erupted, Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah said none of the farmers will be evicted, and notices issued to them will be withdrawn.Responding to a question that similar notices have been issued to farmers in Yadgir and Dharwad districts too, the CM said: ""I will ask the Revenue Minister to look into it, nowhere farmers will be evicted."" Seeking to clarify ""confusion"" over 1,200 acres in Honavada of Tikota taluk being marked as Waqf property, M B Patil (Industries and Vijayapura district in-charge Minister) had recently said it was due to an “error” in the gazette notification.",Karnataka minister Priyank Kharge responded to BJP MP Tejasvi Surya's charge that Waqf Board was encroaching thousands of acres of farmers' land in Karnataka.

BENGALURU: A five-year-old boy sustained injuries on his head after a miscreant smashed the window glass of his car with a stone at Choodasandra , southeast Bengaluru, Wednesday night.While the boy's father claimed he had no idea why the attack took place, a motorist arrested by police said the fight broke out after the car driven by the boy's father rammed a parked car and sped away without stopping.Following the complaint by the injured boy's father, Anoop George of Chikkanayakanahalli, a private company employee, Parappana Agrahara police arrested Krishna Murthy, 23, of Choodasandra, on whose bike the attacker came. He was arrested for aiding the attacker.According to George, he was driving back home with his wife and two minor children when two unidentified motorists blocked his car at 9.30pm. ""They gestured to roll down the glass and step out of the vehicle. When I declined and moved the car, they smashed the backside window with a stone. My son suffered injuries, and he was treated at a hospital,"" he stated.George said after the stone was thrown, he stepped out of the car with his wife to catch hold of the miscreants. ""But we noticed that my son was injured and decided to take him to hospital first. By then, the miscreants had fled,"" he said.George told TOI that he had no idea why the attack took place. ""They suddenly appeared and blocked my car before asking me to step out,"" he said.Meanwhile, police, quoting Krishna Murthy, said George's car rammed into a parked car, and he sped away. The parked car's owner tried to stop him and ask for compensation for the damage caused.""According to Krishna Murthy, he was riding back home when a stranger stopped him and asked for a lift, saying a car had rammed his vehicle and he needed to stop it. Accordingly, Krishna Murthy rode his bike with the stranger on the pillion and spotted the car after covering a short distance. There, the pillion-rider asked the complainant to roll down the windows or come out of the car so that they could speak. But George again moved the car, and the man smashed the window with a stone,"" police said. Police said Krishna Murthy claimed that the pillion-rider took to his heels, while he sped away on his two-wheeler after the attack.George, however, told TOI that he never rammed any vehicle. Police said they can verify the claim after tracing the attacker and car owner, who is at large now. ""Since last night, we were requesting George to lodge the complaint. However, we sent a police sub-inspector this morning to his house to take a statement,"" an officer said.Police have booked a case of criminal intimidation , intentional insult and wrongful restraint.","A five-year-old boy sustained injuries on his head after a miscreant smashed the window glass of his car with a stone.

Americans brace for gridlock amid talk of voter fraud and stolen election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/americans-brace-for-gridlock-amid-talk-of-voter-fraud-and-stolen-election/articleshow/114823254.cms,"Representative Image

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

Americans are bracing for gridlock on November 5/6 with fervid talk in political circles about voting fraud and stolen elections. Partisan judges and litigators in a deeply polarized country are already duking it out in courts, questioning voter registrations and balloting procedures amid wild conspiracy theories that do not augur well for the November 5 Election Day and the results thereafter.Over the weekend, an ABC affiliate station ignited a flurry of conspiracy talk after it aired what appeared to be official election results for Pennsylvania that showed Kamala Harris easily winning the key swing state a week before Election Day. In what was later clarified as randomly-generated numbers for test run, WNEP-TV showed Kamala Harris capturing 52% of the votes to 47% for Trump , with 100% of the precincts reporting, the way it is normally shown. The ""result"" was seen at the bottom of the screen during Sunday’s broadcast of the Formula 1 Mexico Grand Prix.The faux result freaked out MAGA activists who declared ""the cheat is on"" even as the station clarified that it was only a test run to help news organizations make sure their equipment is working properly in advance of election night. One tv station technician explained that stations do election ticker testing all the time and WNEP appeared to have forgotten to bypass to the network feed while testing.The theme of Trump being denied a landslide by election fraud is particularly in the MAGA echo chamber where podcast talking heads such as Dan Bongino, Ben Shapiro, and Charlie Kirk are priming listeners to Trump theory that any result that does not show him as the winner can only mean voter fraud resulting in stolen elections.MAGA talking heads have been working up froth as the expected blow-out by Trump of Harris is nowhere is sight, despite the MAGA supremo repeatedly claiming that he is leading in all seven battleground states, and his surrogates like Elon Mush throwing out numbers from betting markets showing him winning comfortably. More credible polls show them tied within the margin of error, some surveys showing Trump marginally ahead in some states, and Harris in others.Democrats in turn are agitated about partisan judges ruling in favor of Republicans, as are MAGA folk about decisions in favor of Democrats. On Wednesday, the US Supreme Court allowed Virginia to purge about 1,600 people from its voter rolls, handing a provisional victory to Republican officials in the state who said the move was necessary to prevent noncitizens from voting. Notably, the ruling came in a 6-3 split, with the three liberal justices dissenting.The situation is now so polarized that some MAGA talking heads are worrying about wives lying to their pro-Trump husbands and voting for Kamala Harris -- mainly on account of the Republican stand on abortions -- after a Harris campaign ad by Julia Roberts appeared to promote individual choice for women. One agitated Fox News anchor, Jesse Watters, raged that if his wife secretly voted for Harris, ""that's the same thing as having an affair... that would be D(ivorce) Day."" Watters' mother incidentally is a Democrat who has berated him openly on live tv.Some of the tension is spilling over to polling booths in early voting. In Texas, a white Trump supporter got into a spat with a black poll worker who told him that to remove his MAGA cap to obey the rules against wearing campaign paraphernalia in polling stations.","Partisan judges and litigators in a deeply polarized country are already duking it out in courts, questioning voter registrations and balloting procedures.

Temples and iconic landmarks were illuminated, reflecting the spirit of the festival.In a heartfelt message on X, Biden expressed, “This Diwali, may we show the power in the gathering of light. The light of knowledge, of unity, of truth. The light for freedom, for democracy, for an America where anything is possible.” Earlier this week, he hosted a record-breaking Diwali event at the White House, inviting around 600 prominent Indian-Americans from across the country.Harris echoed these sentiments, saying, “Tonight, we join more than 1 billion people lighting diyas and celebrating the fight for good over evil.” Although she traditionally hosts a Diwali gathering at her official residence, her campaign schedule prevented her from doing so this year.Secretary of State Antony Blinken also shared his thoughts on Diwali, underscoring its significance as a time for reflection and community. “It serves as a reminder of our ability to bring more light into our communities,” he said, noting the importance of celebrating with families and friends around the world.In Pennsylvania, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz celebrated Diwali at the Bharatiya Temple in Montgomery County, participating in a diya lighting ceremony. “Happy Diwali to everyone. It’s a privilege to stand amongst you and feel the sense of community,” he remarked, highlighting the contributions of Indian and South Asian communities to the fabric of American society.Walz extended his best wishes for a peaceful Diwali, supporting Harris’s vision for a New Way Forward to assist South Asian American families. His visit was marked by a warm reception from local leaders, including Montgomery County Commissioner Neil Makhija, the first Asian American to hold the position in Pennsylvania.","President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris celebrated Diwali, the Festival of Lights.

Freak Offs: ‘Happy to talk’: Investigators speak to male escorts about Diddy’s infamous ‘freak off’ parties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/happy-to-talk-investigators-speak-to-male-escorts-about-diddys-infamous-freak-off-parties/articleshow/114830828.cms,"Sean 'Diddy' Combs

The FBI has been interviewing male prostitutes in an attempt to unveil the truth behind Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs' alleged ‘Freak Off’ sex parties .A federal law enforcement source who is involved in the investigation told the NY Post, “They’re all too happy to talk. We’re asking them about their recollections of the Freak Offs , what they were paid to do, and who else was involved. I’m surprised how many of them can recall intricate details about what happened.”According to the New York Post report, many of them have aged out of skin biz and mostly have the same details about the parties, including drugs, viagra and Cialis that were allegedly supplied to male escorts before the parties.They told the FBI, ""They were expected to perform and were told that if they didn’t perform, they’d be thrown out of the party and not paid.”Earlier in March the FBI raided two of Diddy’s homes during which they seized hundreds of sex videos and many sex-related tools and objects, including 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lube. In a statement, the US Attorney’s Office alleged that the sex parties were not always consensual.Sean “Diddy” Combs’ alleged sexual abuse of women included forcing them to engage in frequent, days-long sexual activity with male prostitutes, some of whom were “transported over state lines,” according to the charges against him.“These events, which Combs referred to as ‘Freak Offs,’ were elaborate sex performances that he arranged, directed, and often electronically recorded,” the documents said.“To ensure participation in Freak Offs, Combs used violence and intimidation, and leveraged his power over victims” authorities alleged.“In court, the truth will prevail, Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone — adult or minor, man or woman,” his attorneys said in a statement.The New York Post said that they have viewed more than a dozen videos of Diddy’s wild parties, and most of those videos were related to some mainstream events or were after parties of those events, such as the MTV Video Music Awards or the Super Bowl.In the footage obtained by the Post, Combs could be seen watching women have sex with men, and in one video he himself took part, holding the camera from his pov while he seemingly engaged in the sexual activity.“We have to identify all the people in the videos,” says the Fed source. “And then we can figure out how old they were at the time, and make sure that none of them were trafficked or threatened to participate. It’s a long process, but we’re making progress.Authorities are trying to determine if any of the participants in Diddy’s Freak Offs were underage or illegally coerced into performing.Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs has denied any wrongdoing, pleading not guilty and claiming all sexual interactions were consensual. He faces serious charges, including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking , and transportation to engage in prostitution.Additionally, he is charged with over twenty civil lawsuits from alleged victims, including two recent claims from men who allege they were raped by him at ages 10 and 17.","The FBI has been interviewing male prostitutes in an attempt to unveil the truth behind Sean 'Diddy' Combs' alleged 'Freak Off' sex parties.

With five days left for the election as many polls are leaning towards Donald Trump, American University professor Dr Allan Lichtman , called the election Nostradamus because of his track record of perfect prediction, said he will not change his forecast that Kamala Harris will win the election. The prediction was made on September 5, before the ABC News debate and Litchman said ""nothing has changed to change my prediction"". During a livestream Tuesday, he said he's anxious, more anxious not because of the polls but primarily because he's worried about the future of this country.Litchman said he has been doing this for 42 years and every four years. Instead of butterflies, he has a flock of cows in his stomach. ""Of course I'm anxious. Not because of the polls, but primarily because I’m worried about the future of this country.”Lichtman's prediction is not based on polls but on 13 categories which he calls the ""Keys to the White House"" -- and Harris has the edge in eight of those metrics compared to Trump's three.But there is always a possibility that he could be wrong, he conceded. “But it’s always possible that something so cataclysmic and so unprecedented could change the pattern of history.”“My predictions have stood the test of time, my indicators have always been right,” he said. “The keys are very objective and quantitative.”He is a registered Democrat and recently announced that he was cancelling his Washington Post subscription after the paper decided not to endorse a candidate. “There is more election anxiety this year than I have ever seen and I go back to Kennedy-Nixon,” he reflected. “I have never seen this kind of election anxiety because a lot of people believe that the future of the country is on the line here and that democracy in this country could be a thing of the past.”This year, he said he received unprecedented hate in calling the election for Harris. “I have never experienced anything close to the hate that has been reaped upon me this time,” he told NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo.“I’ve been getting feedback that is vulgar, violent, threatening, and even beyond that, the safety and security of my family has been compromised.”",American University professor Dr Allan Lichtman says he won't change his prediction that Kamala Harris is winning the election.

Beatrice Keul Claims Donald Trump Groped Her in 1993: 'My Size Saved Me',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/61-beauty-queen-says-donald-trump-groped-her-in-1993-my-size-saved-me/articleshow/114788975.cms,"A former beauty queen has a fresh allegation against Donald Trump that she was groped by him in 1993.

Yet another former pageant queen, 53-year-old Beatrice Keul claimed she was groped by Donald Trump everywhere in her body after she was invited to a suite at his New York hotel for a 'private talk'. ""I think my size saved me,"" Keul said to Daily Mail about the 1993 incident. The report said Keul is coming forward now with the allegation because she discovered all the documentation. Trump campaign's national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Keul's accusations are false and planted to distract from the accusations against Kamala Harris' husband Doug Emhoff. ""Fake allegations like this are a disservice to women who are truly victims of assault, like the women in Doug Emhoff's past,"" Levitt said.According to the report, Keul attracted Donald Trump's attention when she won second place in the Miss Switzerland 1992 pageant in Zurich and reached the final round of the Miss Europe competition in Istanbul that year.Keul said she received an invitation from Donald Trump American Dream pageant, offering an all-expense-paid trip to New York and Atlantic city to participate in that contest. ""When you are from Switzerland, the US is a big wow. Then you think about New York, that's a second wow. And then comes the name Trump. Wow again"".""Trump, as a brand, was quite something at that time. You could be blinded by all that. I didn't know it's a jungle there.""""Ah we finally meet, Miss Keul. How nice to meet you finally,"" Keul recollected Donald Trump's first words to here where he mispronounced her name as 'cool'.""He stayed a long time. We talked for so long that everybody was staring at us. A good 10 minutes if not 15. I couldn't believe he was so fond of me,"" she said.There was a press luncheon after which Keul was asked by Trump staff to stay back and she was then taken to the upper floors. ""I thought Trump wanted to talk, as the other guy told me...when I entered, he jumped on me. I just had time to turn. I was not prepared. I tried to do what I could to get rid of him...he kissed on my lips and on the neck. He tried to lift my dress. He was grabbing and touching my body everywhere he could.""""I'm very tall, that's what helped me a lot...I think my size saved me,"" she said adding that she managed the situation by saying 'let's talk first'. And that deterred Trump who slowed down and asked her whether she wanted to drink something.After half-an-hour chat, ""he asked me to agree to see him again. I said yes, because I didn't want trouble. He asked me if I'm mad, I said no. I had to find something diplomatic,"" she said.",Beatrice Keul claims she was groped by Donald Trump at his New York hotel in 1993.

It was a tit-for-tat but the offensive coming from President Biden amplified the issue probably more than it deserved became one of the unforgettable moments this election as the MAGA supporters seized on the opportunity to up the ante.The White House attempted a cover-up as in the transcript, Biden's 'garbage' comment reads this: ""The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter's."" The apostrophe could not save the day as the Harris campaign too did not take the comment well. ""Biden's comments are the latest example of why Kamala Harris ' team has been avoiding campaigning with him,"" Axios reported citing Harris aides who call Biden both ""unpopular and undisciplined"".Harris' aides were frustrated last week too when Biden went to New Hampshire and said ""we gotta lock (Trump) up"". Biden later said he only meant it politically. But this was something that Harris' team wanted to avoid. The 'garbage' row also dimmed Kamala Harris' closing argument speech Tuesday night. Biden did not appear alongside her but also ""upstaged"" Kamala Harris.Apart from White House's clarification, Biden too posted a clarification on X. ""Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage - which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonisation of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say.

The video, posted on social media by Mark Ruffalo , features Marvel heavyweights like Robert Downey Jr. , Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson , Danai Gurira, Paul Bettany, and Don Cheadle brainstorming slogans to back Harris, whose campaign has drawn widespread celebrity endorsements.The Avengers actors kick off their reunion with Johansson greeting her fellow ""Avengers"" as they “assemble” for a virtual discussion on voting. The group shares humorous moments, with Downey Jr. suggesting that Harris needs a catchphrase for her campaign. In a playful attempt to create a memorable slogan, they try out lines like “I’m down with democracy,” but quickly realise the phrase might convey an unintended message. Cheadle, imitating Harris's voice, delivers the line, “I’m Kamala Harris, and I say down with democracy,” sparking laughter among the group.Ruffalo, the video’s host, shifts the conversation to a more serious note, encouraging viewers to make their voting plans and bring friends and family to the polls. The light-hearted exchange serves as a call to action, with Ruffalo reminding audiences about the significance of voting. Although the Avengers couldn’t settle on an official slogan for Harris, their message of support for her candidacy is clear. “Kamala forever!” jokes Gurira, a nod to her role as Okoye in Black Panther.Ruffalo shared the video on Twitter and added, ""Don’t sit this one out. It’s the one where we will lose big: Project 2025, women’s reproductive rights, climate change, LGBTQIA+ rights, public education, student debt relief, Affordable Care Act, Social Security, and as of today, life saving vaccines. This shit is real and it’s going to come for you.""This latest celebrity endorsement adds to Harris’s high-profile support, which includes names like Beyonce, LeBron James, Taylor Swift, Jennifer Aniston, and Leonardo DiCaprio. With the race nearing its end, both Harris and former President Donald Trump are vying for last-minute support from voters, particularly in key battleground states. Polls indicate tight races in Georgia and North Carolina, where Trump and Harris are separated by only one or two percentage points, underscoring the stakes of the election.According to recent data from CNN, more than 61 million Americans have already cast their ballots through early voting or mail-in options, a record-breaking early turnout. The race in Georgia and North Carolina is particularly close, with Harris leading among Black voters and college-educated voters, while Trump holds a significant advantage among white voters without college degrees.","Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Danai Gurira, Paul Bettany, and Don Cheadle join forces to back Kamala Harris.

The poll shows Trump ahead in all these states, a potential game-changer for his campaign as he seeks to reclaim the presidency.According to the poll results, Trump leads in Arizona by 5 points, North Carolina by 4, and Nevada by 4. The margins are tighter in Georgia (Trump +2), Pennsylvania (Trump +1), and Michigan (Trump +1), while Kamala Harris narrowly leads in Wisconsin by just 0.3%. This data suggests that if the election were held today, Trump would secure 312 electoral votes, significantly surpassing the threshold needed for victory.Nationally, Trump holds a 1.9% lead in the popular vote, with 49.1% support compared to Harris’s 47.2%. The remaining 3.7% of respondents remain undecided or support other candidates. AtlasIntel's CEO said, ""The polls AtlasIntel released today were not our final polls. Expect one or two more releases prior to Election Day.""With just a few days to go for the United States elections, a staggering 61.0 million Americans have already made their voices heard by casting their ballots in the November election, according to a report by CNN. Notably, voters have cast their ballots either by mail or through early in-person voting for the presidential elections between Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Donald Trump.Meanwhile, new CNN polls conducted by SSRS reveal that the presidential race is heating up in Georgia and North Carolina, with the latest polls showing a neck-and-neck contest between Harris and Trump. Likely voters in Georgia divide 48% for Trump to 47% for Harris, and in North Carolina, Harris stands at 48% to Trump's 47%. These narrow margins are within the poll's margin of error, indicating no clear frontrunner in either state.It is interesting to note that North Carolina, which supported former President Barack Obama in 2008, has voted Republican in the past three presidential elections. However, in 2020, Trump won against US President Joe Biden. Joe Biden made history in Georgia four years ago by defeating Donald Trump with a margin of less than 1 percentage point, becoming the first Democrat to win the state since Bill Clinton's victory in 1992.In both states, Harris is leading among Black likely voters (84% to 13% in Georgia; 78% to 19% in North Carolina) and voters with college degrees (55% to 39% in Georgia; 53% to 42% in North Carolina). On the other hand, Trump holds a commanding lead, 81% to 15%, among white voters without college degrees in Georgia, while leading by a less overwhelming margin, 65% to 31%, in North Carolina.As the candidates campaign in the battleground states, they are not just vying for votes but also addressing pressing issues like border security and immigration, particularly in states with significant Latino populations.","AtlasIntel released its latest battleground poll, indicating a clear lead for Donald Trump across seven critical swing states.

"Donald Trump sues CBS over Kamala Harris’s ‘60 Minutes’ interview, citing 'misleading' editing",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-sues-cbs-over-kamala-harriss-60-minutes-interview-citing-misleading-editing/articleshow/114830756.cms,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump filed a lawsuit against CBS on Thursday, accusing the network of deceptive editing in a recent "" 60 Minutes "" interview with Democratic rival Kamala Harris . The legal action, filed in the Northern District of Texas, alleges that CBS selectively edited Harris’s responses about US policy on the Israel-Hamas conflict, presenting a skewed narrative to the public ahead of the US election.According to Trump’s legal team, Harris’s answer to a question about the Biden administration’s stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict was edited in a way that removed what the lawsuit describes as a “confusing” segment. The complaint argues that the omitted portion, which it labels a “word salad,” would have highlighted Harris’s inability to clearly address US influence over Israel’s wartime conduct. Trump claims this selective editing was done to shield Harris from public scrutiny and demands approximately $10 billion in damages, alleging that CBS violated Texas laws against deceptive business practices.CBS has forcefully rejected the accusations, releasing a statement defending the integrity of the interview. “Former President Trump’s repeated claims against 60 Minutes are false,” a CBS statement said. “The interview was not doctored, and 60 Minutes did not hide any part of Vice President Kamala Harris’s answer to the question at issue. The lawsuit Trump has brought today against CBS is completely without merit, and we will vigorously defend against it.” CBS also asserted that the interview was edited solely to adhere to time constraints, maintaining that “60 Minutes fairly presented the interview to inform the viewing audience, not to mislead it.”This latest lawsuit escalates a public clash between Trump and CBS that has been brewing for weeks. Trump has repeatedly criticized CBS and “60 Minutes” on the campaign trail, describing their actions as “election interference.” He has further claimed that CBS attempted to “save” Harris from embarrassment by replacing what he considered a poor response with a more polished one.In past statements, CBS confirmed that a different portion of Harris’s answer appeared in a promotional clip on “Face the Nation” but insisted the original “60 Minutes” broadcast presented her full response. The network highlighted that the edit was a standard practice to fit the program’s allotted time, adding that they follow consistent principles for all interviews, regardless of the interviewee’s status.This lawsuit comes as both candidates continue their campaigns for next week’s election, in what polls suggest is a tightly contested race. Trump’s team has also indicated that he may seek to revoke CBS’s broadcasting license if he returns to the White House.","Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump filed a lawsuit against CBS on Thursday, accusing the network of deceptive editing in a recent "" 60 Minutes "" interview with Democratic rival Kamala Harris.

There are 8,000 North Korean troops in Russia 's Kursk region, US ambassador to the United Nations Robert Wood told the Security Council on Thursday and asked Moscow whether they would still stand with the statement that there are no DPRK troops in their country.""I have a very respectful question for my Russian colleague: Does Russia still maintain that there are no DPRK troops in Russia?"" Wood said as quoted by Reuters.The Russian representative did not address the inquiry, and Russia has avoided explicit confirmation or denial of these troops' presence.Following Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Ukrainian forces advanced into the Kursk border region in August 2023, where they maintain a presence. Ukraine has identified three North Korean generals allegedly supervising their country's troops in Russia.Multiple nations, including the US, Britain, and South Korea, contend that Russia's use of North Korean troops violates U.N. resolutions and its founding charter. These actions conflict with sanctions designed to restrict North Korea 's nuclear and missile programs.Tensions escalated at the Security Council meeting when the US accused China of providing extensive support to Russia's defense industry. Wood stated: ""China cannot credibly claim to be a voice for peace when it enables Russia to wage the largest war in Europe in decades. China's support to Russia is decisive. China's support is prolonging the war.""China's deputy UN Ambassador Geng Shuang rejected these claims, stating their country has not supplied weapons to any parties in the Ukraine conflict and manages dual-use items according to international standards.

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

It's the garbage , stupid.MAGA Trumpers and Democrats took aim at each other over characterizing their opponents as ""garbage,"" as the stink of mutual denigration enveloped Presidential elections in the self-described greatest country on earth.Seizing on President Joe Biden's putdown of Trump supporters as ""garbage"" and rejecting his clarification that he only meant a Trump rally comedian who called Puerto Rico a ""floating island of garbage,"" the MAGA supremo taunted Democrats by donning a sanitation worker's uniform and driving a garbage truck on Wednesday.“How do you like my garbage truck? This truck is in honor of Kamala and Joe Biden,” Trump told reporters during his salvo. “For Joe Biden to make that statement — it’s really a disgrace.”MAGA faithful, including Elon Musk , saw it as a brilliant act of trolling Dems, but anti-Trumpers saw it as an apt metaphor for a man not short of trash-talk.""Interesting choice to place the garbage in the front of the truck,"" Trump's niece Mary Trump, an anti-MAGA commentator, observed about her 78-year old uncle taking the front passenger seat. Other critics mused about the sight of a man who sits on a golden toilet driving a garbage truck to make a point, even as he stumbled towards the truck in an awkward manner.Anti-Trumpers also rolled out ads and memes showing the MAGA motormouth calling his opponents, including Kamala Harris and her followers, ""garbage"" ""scum"" etc on numerous occasions, not to speak of characterizing the US itself as a ""garbage can"" that other countries are dumping illegal migrants into.“It’s the people that surround her (Kamala Harris), they’re scum and they want to take down our country. They are absolute garbage,” Trump said in one rally, among the numerous times he has used the two words to describe his opponents.Trump supporters later posted a video of the driver behind the wheel of the garbage truck who said he was proud to have driven Trump in his “Garbage Force One. Trump surrogate Vivek Ramaswamy was also part of Trump’s garbage expedition.Kamala Harris, though, came out smelling of roses from the episode as she distanced herself from Biden's remarks, saying, ""I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for.""The White House tried to clear the mess even as pundits and pollsters speculated on whether Biden's snippy remark would undercut Harris' support the same way Hillary Clinton 's description of the MAGA flock as a ""deplorables"" was seen as self-destructive when she ran against Trump in 2016.Although there were other factors that led to Hillary’s defeat, the “deplorables” remark has haunted Democrats since they lost that election narrowly.""He [Biden] does not view Trump supporters or anybody who supports Trump, as garbage. That is not what he views,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at the daily briefing as many Dems ran for cover.Trump later posted in all caps on social media, ""250 MILLION AMERICANS ARE NOT GARBAGE—I CALL YOU THE HEART AND SOUL OF AMERICA!!! #MAGA2024.""

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)

Latin Grammy Award-winner Nicky Jam recently announced he would no longer endorse Donald Trump , citing disrespectful comments about Puerto Rico from a comedian at a Trump rally. In a post on Instagram, the Puerto Rican reggaeton artist explained that his initial support for Trump had been rooted in the belief that Trump’s background as a businessman would positively impact the U.S. economy, which he saw as crucial for Latino communities and immigrants in the country. However, following disparaging remarks about Puerto Rico, Nicky Jam renounced any political support for Trump, stressing the importance of respecting Puerto Rico.The remarks in question came from comedian Tony Hinchcliffe , who performed at Trump’s 2024 rally in New York City and made a controversial joke likening Puerto Rico to “a floating island of garbage.” Reports noted that Hinchcliffe’s set contained additional inflammatory language aimed at Latino, Jewish, and Black communities, all of whom represent key voter demographics in the upcoming election.Hinchcliffe has previously faced similar backlash; in 2021, he was dropped by his talent agency and saw numerous gigs cancelled after using a racial slur directed at Asian American comedian Peng Dang during a performance in Austin, Texas. Despite this, he did not issue an apology.Hinchcliffe’s latest comments appear to have galvanised Latin American artists, with Puerto Rican music icon Bad Bunny quickly declaring his support for Vice President Kamala Harris in response. Other Latin artists have since followed suit, expressing their support for Harris. Meanwhile, Trump described the rally as a “love fest,” though many observers have disagreed, pointing to the divisive rhetoric on display.","Puerto Rican reggaeton artist Nicky Jam announced he would no longer endorse Donald Trump.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan began a nationwide vaccination campaign Monday to protect 45 million children from polio after a surge in new cases that has hampered years of efforts to stop the disease in one of the two countries where it has never been eradicated.Pakistan regularly launches such campaigns, but violence targeting the health workers and police assigned to escort them is common. Militants falsely claim the vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children.The campaign is the third this year and will continue until Sunday ""in response to the alarming increase in polio cases,"" said Ayesha Raza Farooq , the prime minister's adviser for the polio eradication program. ""We are re-energized in our efforts to combat polio,"" she said in a statement.During the door-to-door campaign, children younger than 5 will be vaccinated and given drops of Vitamin A supplements to enhance their immunity.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently met with front-line health workers, urging them to ensure no child was left unvaccinated by going door-to-door.Anwarul Haq, who is the coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, also urged parents to fully cooperate with polio workers. ""Polio has no cure, but it can be prevented with this readily available vaccine,"" he said.Pakistan has recorded 41 cases across 71 districts so far this year, Farooq said. Most were reported from southwestern Balochistan and southern Sindh province, following by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and eastern Punjab province.The surge in cases in new locations is worrying authorities since previous cases were from the restive northwest bordering Afghanistan, where the Taliban government in September suddenly stopped a door-to-door vaccination campaign.Authorities in Pakistan say the Afghan Taliban's recent decision to stop door-to-door anti-polio campaign will have repercussions beyond the Afghan border, as people from both sides frequently travel to each other's country. The World Health Organization has confirmed 18 polio cases in Afghanistan this year.Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries in the world where the spread of polio has never been stopped. It is one of the world's most infectious diseases, so it continues to spread anywhere people are not fully vaccinated.

He stated, ""Some KP ministers are more focused on benefits than promoting the goals of the PTI.""The MNA mentioned that he had received threats of expulsion from the party but asserted that such threats would not dissuade him.

He noted that he would inform Imran about alleged misconduct by certain officials, whom he believes should face prosecution rather than be rewarded with government positions.Citing a previous incident, Marwat criticized the recent promotion of a police officer who reportedly fired at him in Bajaur. He noted that the officer has now been elevated to the position of senior superintendent of police (SSP) in Peshawar.The report further stated that the PTI leader stated that he would update Imran on grievances to confront the current situation within PTI's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa leadership. He urged for a strong strategy to aid in securing the release of the party's founder.Marwat's comments follow reports of internal conflicts within the PTI that surfaced during the D-Chowk protests earlier this month and later over the voting for the 26th Constitutional Amendment , where some party members voted in favour of changes that contradicted the party's policy.In a related development, Zain Qureshi resigned as the PTI's deputy parliamentary leader in the National Assembly a day ago after receiving a show-cause notice for severing ties with the PTI leadership during the passage of the amendment in both houses.

They argue that the daytime power outages are solely to ensure a continuous electricity supply at night for the ongoing operation of CCTV cameras in the sub-jail.The union further contended that the decision to cut power constitutes an ""economic murder"" of local traders, who have been unable to conduct business for over a week. Consequently, the union is urging immediate action to restore power supply in the area, aiming to safeguard the economic interests of both residents and business operators.","Residents of Karachi have been experiencing severe and unusual load-shedding, leading to power outages during the daytime.
