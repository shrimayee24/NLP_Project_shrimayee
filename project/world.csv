HYDERABAD: Telangana police have arrested a man from Maharashtra for murdering one of his three children so that he would be eligible to contest the gram panchayat election. Those with more than two children are barred from contesting local body elections in Maharashtra.Pandurang Kondamangale, a resident of Kerur village in Nanded, who was arrested on Monday, has been accused of drowning his six-year-old daughter, Prachi, in the Nizamsagar canal in Nizamabad on Jan 29. ""Pandurang first had twin daughters, including Prachi,"" a police officer told TOI. ""Later, he had a son too. He decided to kill Prachi to realise his political ambitions.""Officials also arrested the present sarpanch of Kerur, Ganesh Shinde, for allegedly helping Pandurang plan the murder.The killing came to light after police officers from Nizamabad's Bodhan rural police station started investigating the suspicious death of an unknown girl, whose body was found in the Nizamsagar canal. To identify the girl, a constable uploaded a photograph of the body as his status message on WhatsApp and asked people to share leads. The image was also shared with other police stations.Within a few hours police officers from Mukhed taluk in Maharashtra contacted their counterparts in Bodhan and identified the girl as Prachi, barber Pandurang's daughter, who had been missing for a few days.Bodhan police officials then got in touch with Pandurang and found that he was giving inconsistent replies to many of their queries.Suspecting that Pandurang had killed his daughter, police officials tracked his mobile phone's tower locations and found out that he had brought Prachi to Telangana. During interrogation, he allegedly cracked and confessed to killing Prachi.Officials alleged that Ganesh encouraged Pandurang to contest the panchayat elections, due in about six months. However, both realised that Pandurang would be ineligible as a candidate as he had three children.Nizamabad police commissioner P Sai Chaitanya said the duo initially tried to give the girl up for adoption to couples wanting children. ""When the attempt failed, they allegedly conspired to kill Prachi. On Jan 29, Pandurang came to Nizamsagar canal with Prachi and pushed her into the water before returning to his village,"" Sai Chaitanya said.","Pandurang Kondamangale, a resident of Kerur village in Nanded, has been accused of drowning his six-year-old daughter, Prachi, in the Nizamsagar canal in Nizamabad.

Noida: Techies Held for Harassment, Postman in Fake Passport Racket, Power Upgrades Ahead and More





NOIDA: Two software engineers were arrested for allegedly pulling up alongside a family's car in a moving SUV and harassing a woman with lewd gestures, remarks and blown kisses.Police said the incident occurred on Saturday night as the Greater Noida West family — a man, his wife and child — drove towards Sector 18.Trouble began near Parthala roundabout, where a red MG Hector started following their vehicle.As the SUV drew level, its occupants allegedly rolled down a window and began making obscene gestures and inappropriate signals at the man's wife, who was seated in the rear seat.The two accused, police said, tried to force the woman's attention by waving, shouting and blowing kisses in their direction.Sensing the seriousness of what was happening, the man recorded a video from inside his car. Soon after, the SUV sped away, he alleged.On Sunday, the man posted the clip of the incident on X, tagging UP Police and the chief minister, and demanding strict action.Police said that the vehicle number visible in the video became the key lead.A case was subsequently registered against unknown persons, and police teams began scanning CCTV footage from nearby areas to track the SUV's route.A team from Phase-3 police station later traced the two accused to Sector 135 and arrested them on Sunday evening.They were identified as Amit Kumar of Azamgarh and Abhishek of Mainpuri. Both of the accused live in a rented accommodation at JVS Society in Sector 135 and work as engineers at a Noida-based IT company.The MG Hector, bearing registration number UP 75 AH 3565, was seized.During interrogation, police said, the men admitted they had too much to drink at a party earlier that evening and were roaming the city when they harassed the family.""Further legal proceedings are underway,"" police officials said.According to police sources, the two showed cops a video in which they appeared to blow kisses towards the child in the car.","Two software engineers were arrested for allegedly pulling up alongside a family's car in a moving SUV and harassing a woman with lewd gestures, remarks and blown kisses.

NEW DELHI: As the united opposition raised an alarm over the US trade deal “selling away the blood and sweat” of Indian farmers, Congress neta Rahul Gandhi Tuesday said PM Narendra Modi is “compromised” because of the court case against Adani in the US and the Epstein files. He said the PM suddenly signed off on the trade deal because he is under “pressure”.Rahul said the case against Adani basically targets the PM because the business leader represents the financial structure of Modi and BJP, while the US has not yet released the full material they have on Epstein Files. “These are the two pressure points, and the country should understand that the PM is compromised,” he told reporters.The leader of opposition in Lok Sabha said the issue about General M M Naravane’s purported memoirs that he wanted to speak on in the House is a “sideshow”. “The country has to think hard about why the PM is compromised, and who has compromised him,” he remarked.Sharpening his attack, Rahul said Modi signed the US trade deal after it was stuck for four months, and on which nothing had changed. He said, “Modi is scared. He is under tremendous pressure, and the balloon of his image that has been created by spending crores, can burst.”Rahul added, “Indian farmers must understand that Modi has sold off their hard work and their blood and sweat through this trade deal. And he has done so because he is compromised. And he has not only sold off the farmers but sold off the country.” Samajwadi Party , DMK , Left parties, TMC and others joined hands in raising questions about the Indo-US deal. MP Randeep Surjewala said announcements by the US agriculture secretary and US President Donald Trump have made it clear that “Americal agricultural products will come to India on zero tariffs and flood the Indian markets, to the detriment of Indian farmers.”The opposition demanded that the trade deals with the US and the European Union be tabled in Parliament and debated.AICC spokesman Jairam Ramesh underlined that the deal was announced by Trump Monday night, just like he had announced the halting of Operation Sindoor. “From the information President Trump has provided, it is abundantly clear that PM Modi has — like he did on May 10, 2025 — completely surrendered. He has most definitely appeased President Trump. India stands diminished by this unfortunate sequence of events,” Ramesh said.",Congress neta Rahul Gandhi said PM Narendra Modi is “compromised’ because of the court case against Adani in the US and the Epstein files.

JAMMU: Peoples Conference MLA Sajad Lone’s amendments for restoration of Article 370 , Article 35-A and J&K’s statehood in lieutenant-governor Manoj Sinha’s address to the assembly’s budget session were rejected on Tuesday amid bedlam over several issues, mainly BJP’s demands for a National Law University (NLU) in Jammu.Sinha’s address at the start of the session on Monday did not mention the two matters. Rejecting the amendments, Speaker Abdul Rahim Rather of the governing National Conference (NC) told Lone the House had already passed a resolution on special status in its first session in Nov 2024 and rules do not permit further discussions on an issue already debated.The Speaker further pointed out that granting statehood falls within the domain of the Centre and advised Lone to raise only those issues on which J&K govt is competent to respond or take a decision.Outside the assembly, Lone said four of his other amendments were, however, accepted, including those concerning daily wagers, NLU and condemnation of attacks on Kashmiris outside J&K.Lone dismissed as “theatrics” protests outside the assembly by NC MLAs for statehood and special status. “History will read what was said and decided inside the House,” Lone said. NCP MLA Mubarak Gul asserted the demands will be raised in the House during this session.The NLU row continued to polarise the House, with Lone citing chief minister Omar Abdullah’s assurance. J&K has no NLU at present but the demand for it to be located in Jammu gained traction after Omar said last year that it would come up in Kashmir’s Budgam. Omar has rejected BJP’s demands on NLU, calling them “politically motivated” and pointing out that there were no protests in the Valley when Jammu was given both an IIT and an IIM.As House proceedings started on Tuesday, BJP MLAs renewed the NLU demand, while NC and PDP legislators took up the issue of alleged harassment of Kashmiri Muslims outside J&K.BJP’s Surjit Singh Slathia pointed out that students are demonstrating on streets for the NLU to be based in Jammu and his party stands with them. Another BJP MLA, Balwant Singh Mankotia, argued that Jammu would be a better location for NLU in terms of security, weather and road connectivity.NC MLAs highlighted the alleged harassment of Kashmiris in various parts of the country and were joined by some lawmakers of opposition PDP. “I support the cause, not NC,” PDP MLA Muntazir Mehdi clarified.PDP’s Waheed-ur-Rehman Para moved an adjournment motion to discuss alleged attacks on Kashmiris, arguing they were “hate crimes”. Speaker Rather rejected the move. He said the Omar-led govt has taken up the issue with various states and is thankful to Pushkar Singh Dhami, CM of BJP-governed Uttrakhand, for taking action recently in one such case.",Sinha’s address at the start of the session on Monday did not mention the two matters.

JAMMU: Parties across the political divide in J&K have welcomed the announcement on Tuesday by railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw that three proposed railway projects in the state have been put on hold for now following opposition from the state govt and MPs, who have argued that the track alignments could damage apple orchards.Vaishnaw said there was a demand for three additional railway projects in the region, but these had been kept on hold for now due to the objections raised.He did not specify the names of the projects.The governing National Conference said the halted proposals include the Bijbehara-Pahalgam railway link and the Pulwama-Shopian railway project. The issue was earlier raised by local farmers, legislators, including Anantnag-Poonch MP Mian Altaf and the opposition PDP leaders.Pahalgam legislator Altaf Kaloo and the NC spokesman Tanvir Sadiq thanked CM Omar Abdullah and MP Mian Altaf for what they described as their “timely and critical intervention” in stopping the proposed railway tracks between Bijbehara-Pahalgam and Anantnag-Shopian.“This is a vital step towards protecting people’s livelihoods, apple orchards and the fragile ecology of the region,” Kaloo said.PDP president and former CM Mehbooba Mufti said, “The decision to put the Pahalgam and Shopian railway lines on hold brings much-needed relief to Kashmir’s agrarian economy.These projects threatened to destroy scarce fertile land and push over a million rural families into uncertainty. In any future plan, farmers and local communities must be taken on board to protect Kashmir’s economy and social fabric.”CPI(M) legislator M Y Tarigami said connectivity to areas like Pahalgam and Shopian and other areas of J&K already exists through road networks and more roads are coming up. “Development is meaningless if it destroys livelihoods,” he said, hailing the railway minister for the decision to halt the projects.","Three proposed railway projects in J&K have been put on hold for now.

LUCKNOW: Gold buys food. In eastern Uttar Pradesj, food brought gold. For a 12-year-old schoolboy, an offer of unlimited free momos was worth more than the metal locked in a family cupboard. For two roadside vendors, the boy’s craving turned into a gold mine.Police said the class 7 student handed over jewellery worth Rs 85 lakh from his family home to momo sellers near Dumari Chauraha in Deoria — about 350km east of Lucknow — trading ornaments for what he was promised would be a lifetime supply of free dumplings. The trail surfaced when jewellery vanished from the cupboard. The boy’s mother and aunt went looking. The cupboard was empty. Questions followed. The child broke down and told his father he had traded the valuables for “unlimited free food for a lifetime”.According to a complaint filed by the boy’s father, a temple priest, the child had grown fond of momo sold at the roadside stall.The vendors allegedly began feeding him free of cost, winning trust bite by bite. Soon came bigger offers — food, small sums of money, loyalty.Then persuasion. Unaware of the stakes, the boy began removing jewellery from home and handing it over, police said.Gold necklaces. Rings. Bangles. Mangtika. Nose pins. Earrings. Silver toe rings. Family heirlooms, one snack at a time. The vendors vanished soon enough.The priest approached police on Feb 1, alleging the momo sellers threatened the child with dire consequences to keep him silent.

BENGALURU: In a cheque bounce case, the Karnataka high court has ruled that trial courts cannot levy fines exceeding twice the dishonoured cheque amount.Justice V Srishananda made the observation while partly allowing an appeal filed by Mahadevi, an agriculturist from Banahatti in Bagalkot district. In Nov 2007, Mahadevi bought two trailers for Rs 3.8 lakh after she was allowed a Rs 5,000 discount.She issued a cheque for the trailers, but the cheque was dishonoured. Following this, the seller registered a cheque bounce case. On May 8, 2017, the magistrate’s court at Banahatti convicted her, directing her to pay Rs 7.6 lakh as compensation to the seller and Rs 5,000 as defraying expenses to state govt.Mahadevi’s appeal against the order was dismissed by the district court, and she moved the HC. She said the trailers had not been delivered to her, but Justice Srishananda noted Mahadevi had failed to establish her claim. The judge directed Mahadevi to pay Rs 7.6 lakh as compensation to the complainant, but set aside the order regarding Rs 5,000 to be paid towards defraying expenses, ruling that no state machinery was involved in the transaction.","The Karnataka high court has ruled that trial courts cannot levy fines exceeding twice the dishonoured cheque amount.

LUCKNOW: The Lucknow bench of Allahabad high court on Tuesday said that under the current law, no person or political party can be completely barred from contesting elections merely on the ground that it is influencing voters on the basis of caste or religion.The court said that it is the subject of the legislature to make laws in this regard, and the Election Commission cannot cancel the registration of any political party on this ground.A division bench of Justice Rajan Roy and Justice AK Chaudhary passed the verdict on a PIL filed by Motilal Yadav in 2013, seeking direction against holding of caste-based rallies by political parties. In an interim order in July 2013 itself, a bench of Justice Uma Nath Singh and Justice Mahendra Dayal had stayed caste-based rallies “with immediate effect” throughout UP.In its final order on Tuesday, the court said that Section 8A of the Representation of the People Act is the only provision under which disqualification is permitted in cases of electoral malpractice. The high court clarified that the power to impose a pre-emptive ban on a political party or individual is not currently available in the law and that this matter falls entirely within the jurisdiction of the legislature.Citing previous Supreme Court decisions, the court stated that even the Election Commission does not have the power to deregister a political party except under limited circumstances prescribed by the apex court.The high court also clarified that the recognition of a recognized political party can be suspended or withdrawn under Paragraph 16A of the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968. However, only the legislature, not the court, has the power to add new or additional provisions in this regard. The court, however, cited an order of the UP govt passed in Sept 2025 which bans caste-based rallies in the state.",Lucknow bench of Allahabad high court said no person or political party can be completely barred from contesting elections.

MUMBAI: After assuming the role of Maharashtra’s deputy CM, Sunetra Pawar is set to become NCP national chief, replacing husband Ajit Pawar who was killed in an air crash last week. Amid speculation about whether he would take up the role, party working president Praful Patel ruled himself out of the race and said the party wanted her to accept the post.Meanwhile, Maharashtra govt appointed her guardian minister for Pune and Beed, posts earlier held by Ajit.“We would all like her to accept the post of party chief and support her in taking the party forward. This would be the real homage to Ajit Pawar,” Patel said, adding, “We will have to call a party meeting and take a decision in keeping with the sentiments of the party and public. I am not in the race.” He said the issue of a merger between NCP and Sharad Pawar’s NCP (SP) was not before them at this point.“We are focusing on settling party affairs,” Patel said. Dismissing talk of a merger, he said Ajit had clarified at least twice to TV channels that there was no such proposal and the coordination was only for local body polls. “We allied with BJP in Ahilyanagar and Shiv Sena in Nasik too,” he said.“He (Ajit) did say some people expressed the sentiment that the parties should work together, but there was no serious discussion,” Patel said. He dismissed videos of a meeting between NCP and NCP (SP) netas, saying, “We do meet... We were once part of the same family.”","Sunetra Pawar is set to become NCP national chief, replacing husband Ajit Pawar. Party working president Praful Patel ruled himself out of the race.

Sonam Wangchuk's Wife Blasts Modi Govt & CRPF Over 6Th Schedule, Dismisses FCRA, Pak Link Charges

NEW DELHI: Centre on Tuesday told Supreme Court that all procedural safeguards were followed while ordering detention of climate activist Sonam Wangchuk and action against him was taken for instigating people in the sensitive border area of Ladakh.Continuing with his earlier submission on Monday, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and P B Varale that Wangchuk’s speech was intended to provoke people to indulge in violence against govt and justified his detention under National Security Act.“This court is dealing with a person who is instigating people in a border area, adjacent to Pakistan and China, where regional sensitivity is involved,” he said.Referring to the activist’s speech, the solicitor general said he had stated that Ladakhis could not choose their own representatives while China and Tibet etc have autonomous rights which is highly objectionable.“This is a preventive action so that he doesn’t keep repeating the things he (Wangchuk) said. The detention strikes at the very purpose for which the NSA was enacted. It will have a contextual meaning.

KULLU: A pair of peacocks were spotted in a snow-covered forest of Jagatsukh village at an altitude of over 6000ft (approx 1,800m) near Himachal Pradesh’s Manali — the rare sighting triggering concerns about the impact of climate change on this fragile ecosystem.Commonly found in warmer regions, the peacocks have sparked a sensation in Jagatsukh.Balak Ram Sharma, 52, of Jagatsukh, said some villagers told him the pair moved into the forest last summer but were rarely spotted. “We checked one of the peacocks and found it was not injured and its flight was normal,” Kullu deputy conservator of forests (wildlife) Rajesh Sharma told TOI. According to Sharma, the rise in average temperature could be one of the reasons for this rare sighting at such an altitude.“There were no ceiling fans in homes in Kullu and Manali even 10-15 years ago. But the climate has got warmer at most places and the high hills are not as cold as they once were, so peacocks may be finding the upper regions of Kullu habitable and have started acclimatising,” said Sharma.Peacocks in Himachal Pradesh are generally found at altitudes of 1,000m but some thrive in areas up to 1,500m. Himachal Pradesh has become significantly warmer in the last 124 years. According to meteorological department, the state has recorded a rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius in average mean temperature since 1901.","A pair of peacocks were spotted in a snow-covered forest of Jagatsukh village at an altitude of over 6000ft (approx 1,800m) near Himachal Pradesh’s Manali.

“… Agar us apradhi ko goli chalane ki swatantra hai … toh police ke pass bhi

LUCKNOW: UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday defended the police’s use of force against criminals with a poser: “Should police only be shot at and not shoot back (Agar police goli na maare toh kya police goli khaye)? Both cannot happen simultaneously. ”“If a criminal has the freedom to fire, the police have been given pistols for the same reason, to confront him. Police are trained to make criminals understand the law in a language they speak,” he added.Speaking at a pharma conclave in the city on Tuesday, he said restoring public confidence was as big a challenge as tackling crime after 2017. Yogi said he had seen how criminals mocked the law and made the people of the state suffer between 2003 and 2017, adding that law and order was his biggest challenge when PM Narendra Modi delegated the responsibility of UP to him in 2017.“The solution was found in our policy of zero tolerance for criminals. The law was placed above everyone and there will be no exception, no pick and choose. Even those on our side will have to face the same consequences if in the wrong,”Yogi said.The CM recalled that when the crackdown began, establishing a fear of the law was tough. “When action was initiated, efforts were made to act within the framework of the law, but many times when the person in front is not afraid of the law, bringing him within the ambit of the law and explaining it in the language he understands becomes an immediate necessity,” he said.(If a criminal feels he has the freedom to shoot, then so do the police),” he said.Yogi noted that the formula worked in favour of the state. “When criminals were dealt with in the language they understand, you saw that over the past nine years, major festivals were held peacefully. There was no breach of peace, no anarchy, no extortion, riots, or hooliganism, and UP established itself as a leading investment destination,” he added.“UP has shed its image as a hub of riots, extortion and lawlessness… UP is no longer a ‘Bimaru’ state, it is a breakthrough state now,” the CM said.",Yogi Adityanath: Police are trained to make criminals understand the law in a language they speak.

'PM Modi Under Pressure From Trump': Rahul Gandhi Claims As Trade Deal Debate Paralyses Lok Sabha

NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday wrote a letter to Speaker Om Birla, registering his ""strongest protest"" on not being allowed to speak on the President's address during the ongoing Budget session of Parliament.Gandhi described this as a ""blot on our democracy.""On Monday, the treasury benches objected to the Congress MP quoting an excerpt from an unpublished book by General MM Naravane (retired) on the India-China military clashes in Ladakh in June 2020. They argued that House rules prohibit a member from citing a book that has not yet been published.Naravane was the Army Chief at the time. The excerpts were recently published by an online portal.“By long-standing convention, a member who wishes to refer to a document in the House is required to authenticate it and affirm responsibility for its contents. Once this requirement is fulfilled, the Speaker allows the member to quote or refer to the document. Thereafter, it becomes the responsibility of the government to respond, and the role of the Chair stands concluded,” Gandhi wrote in his letter to Birla.The Raebareli MP added that being “prevented” from speaking is not only a violation of this convention but also reflects what he called a “deliberate attempt” to stop him from addressing the House in his capacity as the LoP.“The right of the LoP and of each member to speak is integral to our democracy. The refusal of these basic democratic rights has led to an unprecedented situation. For the first time in parliamentary history, on the behest of the government, the Speaker has been forced to prevent the LoP from speaking on the President’s address. This is a blot on our democracy, against which I register my strongest protest,” he added.Gandhi has alleged that the government is “scared” of what is written in the book. He attempted to speak on the issue on Tuesday as well but was again unable to do so.","Gandhi described this as a ""blot on our democracy"" The treasury benches objected to the Congress MP quoting an excerpt from an unpublished book on the India- China military clashes in Ladakh.

NEW DELHI: Addressing a meeting of the BJP-led NDA parliamentary party on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi termed the India–US trade deal a “big decision” that would “benefit everyone in the country.”The NDA coalition partners congratulated PM Modi on the trade agreements with the European Union, signed on January 27, and the United States, announced by President Donald Trump on Monday, saying the deals would boost Indian manufacturers, exporters, and entrepreneurs.Briefing the media on the prime minister’s remarks, Union minister Kiren Rijiju said PM Modi told the ruling coalition that its electoral successes were driven by “people-friendly policies” and ""sustained hard work.""Quoting PM Modi, Rijiju noted that the NDA was “winning one after another elections due to its good work. Elections can’t be won without being on the ground. We have to be on the ground and do good work for the welfare of the people.”He added that the prime minister also urged the NDA MPs not to get “complacent” after victories in various polls, including local body elections, but to continue with the good work.Rijiju further stated that the PM gave “broad guidelines” to the NDA MPs in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha to carry forward their parliamentary responsibilities and welfare work.MPs from the BJP, TDP, JD(U), LJP (R), Shiv Sena, JD(S), and other constituents of the alliance were present at the meeting.India and the United States have agreed to a trade deal under which Washington will reduce the reciprocal tariff on Indian goods to 18% from a total of 50%.The deal was announced following a telephonic conversation between PM Modi and President Trump, after which the US leader took to his Truth Social platform to declare that the agreement would take effect “immediately.”While the finer details are yet to be disclosed, Trump noted that Washington would levy a reduced reciprocal tariff, cutting it from 25% to 18%. New Delhi, he added, would bring down its tariffs and non-tariff barriers against the United States to zero.He further claimed that India has committed not to buy oil from Russia - half of the 50% tariffs on India were because of its purchase of Russian oil.Trump also claimed that India would now buy “much more oil” from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela — a Latin American nation where US forces carried out a military operation on January 3 that resulted in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.",NDA MPs Felicitate PM Modi For India-US trade Deal At Parliamentary Party Meeting.

NEW DELHI: A routine visit with his friends to a Delhi Development Authority park in Rohini on Aug 10, 2024, ended in seven-yearold Tarun drowning in a pond brimming with rainwater. By the time police rushed to the spot, the boy had been taken to hospital where he was declared dead.His devastated family members have since been searching for answers and seeking accountability, determined to fathom whose negligence led to their tragic loss. However, to this day, they don’t know who was culpable.Tarun left behind his father, Pravesh; mother Dipali; an elder sister and a younger brother. The family had moved from Uttar Pradesh's Aligarh to the capital five years ago, seeking better educational opportunities for the kids and a more secure livelihood.“They came here hoping for a good life, but the tragedy put paid to that,” Jaswant Singh, a family member, says. “Tarun was lively, bright and full of energy. He had a beautiful and curious mind.”Singh feels the death could have been avoided had adequate safeguards been in place in the park. “It was down to negligence on behalf of authorities. Proper barricades and warning signs as well as the presence of a guard leading to the pond could have prevented the drowning.”However, the Authority disputed this version. In a statement issued after the incident that occurred at Chhat ghat inside the 12-acre district park adjoining Aman Vihar resettlement colony, it said the waterbody with an average depth of three-and-a-half feet had been fenced off by a grill.It claimed a guard present there had warned “seven to eight children who were playing in the park to keep off the pond”, which was full of water following heavy showers. Despite that, they ventured into the area. When Tarun fell into the water, the guard fished him out and took him to hospital, the Authority claimed.Police inspected the spot, before examining witnesses, Tarun’s parents and those who took him to hospital and recorded their statements. There were no warning signs near the waterbody, a senior police officer said, adding that a case under Section 106(1) of BNS, concerning death due to negligence, had been registered.Notices were served to the Authority’s horticulture department, responsible for maintaining green spaces, and replies received, the cop said. Further probe to fix accountability is ongoing. “Once those responsible are identified, a charge sheet will be filed and legal action taken,” he said.Until then, the family, which is yet to receive compensation, is hoping and praying that justice for Tarun is not far away.","Seven-year-old Tarun drowned in a pond brimming with rainwater.

The temple is spread in a total of 2.35 acres of land. The petitioners have also constructed multi storeyed buildings obtaining requisite permissions from the authorities.Though the petitioners claimed to have purchased the lands through registered sale deeds and had been in possession of the land for a long time, the tribunal examined the evidence and in October 2025 held that the petitioners had encroached into the temple land and ordered for their eviction.Challenging the tribunal order, the petitioners approached the high court seeking to set aside the tribunal’s eviction orders and pass orders in their favour restoring their ownership rights on the land.Endowments department counsel Bhukya Mangilal Naik and govt Pleader Herur Rajesh Kumar and Standing Counsel Ch.

He played a key role in his father's regime, later becoming a divisive figure during the 2011 uprising. After years of detention and a death sentence, he resurfaced seeking the presidency, a bid that ultimately failed.

Capture, detention and legal cases

Return from the shadows and election bid

Symbolic weight, contested legacy





Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, once viewed as the Western-friendly face of Libya and heir apparent to longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi, was killed in a “direct confrontation” after gunmen broke into his home, his office said on Tuesday. No further details of the incident were disclosed.Despite holding no official government post, Saif al-Islam was for years considered one of the most powerful figures in Libya, shaping policy and serving as a key interlocutor with Western governments during his father’s four-decade rule.Educated at the London School of Economics and fluent in English, Saif al-Islam cultivated close ties with Western capitals and was widely seen as a reformist figure within the Libyan system.He played a central role in Libya’s decision to abandon its weapons of mass destruction programme and negotiated compensation for families of victims of the 1988 Pan Am Flight 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.He frequently called for a constitution, political reform and respect for human rights, positioning himself as the figure who could reintegrate Libya into the international community after years of sanctions and isolation.That image collapsed when the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi erupted. Saif al-Islam publicly sided with his father and became one of the architects of the regime’s violent response to the revolt, referring to rebels as “rats”.“We fight here in Libya, we die here in Libya,” he told Reuters at the time. He warned that “rivers of blood” would flow and said the government would fight “to the last man and woman and bullet”.In a televised address, he cautioned: “All of Libya will be destroyed. We will need 40 years to reach an agreement on how to run the country, because today, everyone will want to be president, or emir, and everybody will want to run the country.”After Tripoli fell to rebels, Saif al-Islam attempted to flee to neighbouring Niger disguised as a Bedouin tribesman. He was captured by the Abu Bakr al-Sadiq Brigade militia and taken to the western town of Zintan, about a month after his father was killed by rebels.“I’m staying here. They’ll empty their guns into me the second I go out there,” he said in comments captured on an audio recording during his capture, according to Reuters.He spent about six years in detention in Zintan. Human Rights Watch said he did not allege physical abuse, though concerns were raised over prolonged solitary confinement. He said he was isolated and did not receive visitors, though he had access to television and books.In 2015, a Tripoli court sentenced him to death by firing squad for war crimes. The International Criminal Court also issued an arrest warrant against him for “murder and persecution”.Released in 2017 under an amnesty law, Saif al-Islam remained largely underground for years to avoid assassination, according to Libyan analyst Mustafa Fetouri. From 2016, he was allowed limited contact with people inside and outside Libya.In 2021, wearing traditional Libyan attire, he resurfaced publicly to file his candidacy for Libya’s planned presidential elections, seeking to draw on nostalgia for stability under his father’s rule.His candidacy proved deeply divisive. He was disqualified due to his conviction, and efforts to appeal were blocked by armed groups. The dispute became a major factor in the collapse of the election process and Libya’s return to political stalemate.“I’ve been away from the Libyan people for 10 years,” he told The New York Times Magazine in 2021. “You need to come back slowly, slowly. Like a striptease. You need to play with their minds a little.”Analysts say Saif al-Islam retained symbolic importance despite limited public engagement.“After Saif al-Islam was freed a few years ago, he proved incapable of delivering speeches or producing public statements through the press or social media,” Jalel Harchaoui of the Royal United Services Institute told Reuters. “Yet his symbolic significance remained substantial.”“Now that he has been slain, most pro-Gaddafi factions will experience both diminished morale and anger,” Harchaoui said, adding that one major obstacle to holding elections in Libya had been removed.","Saif al-Islam Gaddafi was killed in a ‘direct confrontation’ after gunmen broke into his home. He played a key role in his father's regime, later becoming a divisive figure during the 2011 uprising. After years of detention and a death sentence, he resurfaced seeking the presidency.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127897864,imgsize-946006,width-400,resizemode-4/127897864.jpg"
US-Iran tensions: Pakistan to be a part of Turkey-led peace talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/us-iran-tensions-pakistan-to-be-a-part-of-turkey-led-peace-talks/articleshow/127898563.cms,"‘US Must Pay’: Iran Threatens To ‘Walk Away’ From Nuclear Talks; Khamenei Aide Drops Bombshell

Focus on nuclear issue

Signals from Washington and Tehran





Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States aimed at easing tensions between the two countries, slated to take place on Friday in Turkey.“Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query, reported Dawn.Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar is expected to take part in the meeting, the daily reported citing a diplomatic source, adding that “Islamabad’s participation was seen as significant.”An Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity that the meeting is likely to be held in Turkiye on Friday. The format of the talks remains unclear, though the official said the main meeting would take place that day.A regional official told Reuters that the priority of the talks was to avoid conflict and de-escalate tensions between Iran and the US, adding that several regional powers had been invited at the foreign ministers’ level.According to the official, countries invited include Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).US outlet Axios, citing two sources and a US official, reported that Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible agreement related to Iran’s nuclear programme.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had instructed Araghchi to pursue “fair and equitable negotiations” in an environment “free from threats and unreasonable expectations”.The talks, he said in posts on X, would be held “within the framework of our national interests”.US President Donald Trump has said he is hopeful Washington would “work something out” with Iran but warned on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal was reached.In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal.”“In return, we expect sanctions to be lifted,” he added, while warning that Iran was prepared for war if talks failed, saying any conflict would likely spread beyond Iran.Turkiye has been leading diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and engaging with regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have assured Tehran that they would not allow their airspace or territory to be used for military action against Iran, while Jordan has said it would not act as a “launching pad” for any such action.","Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States.

A former nurse has pleaded guilty to fraud and drug possession after admitting to defrauding a Quebec medical clinic of more than $55,000 to obtain opioid medications.Lovedip Sandhu, a 35-year-old Canadian national and resident of Pierrefonds, entered her guilty plea in mid-January to charges of fraud over $5,000 and simple possession of narcotics. The offences stem from her work at a private plastic surgery clinic in Montreal in 2021, reports French-Canadian newspaper La Presse.Sandhu was employed at Clinique K, a plastic surgery clinic in Westmount, where she worked as a nursing assistant. Her duties included preparing patients for surgery, organising medication orders, and dealing with pharmaceutical companies on behalf of the clinic.Between March and September 2021, prosecutors say Sandhu carried out 75 fraudulent transactions without her employer’s knowledge. She forged the signature of the clinic’s owner, Dr Karl Schwarz, to place orders for opiates. She later collected the drugs from pharmacies and paid for them using the clinic’s credit cards.Through the scheme, Sandhu obtained 3,778 one-millilitre vials of sufentanil and 2,138 one-millilitre vials of hydromorphone.At the time of the offences, Sandhu was a registered member of the Quebec Order of Nurses and Nursing Assistants.She is no longer part of the professional body, having been expelled in 2022.Following her arrest in September 2021, Sandhu told police she had developed an addiction earlier that year due to health issues. She admitted initially taking medication from the clinic’s supply before her use increased.Police searches uncovered empty syringes and vials, several boxes of medication, and $11,000 in cash at her homes. Sentencing submissions in the case have been postponed until June.","Lovedip Sandhu, a 35-year-old Canadian national, entered her guilty plea in mid- January to charges of fraud over $5,000 and simple possession of narcotics.

Several other artists, including Bad Bunny and Kehlani, also used their acceptance speeches to address immigration enforcement and to highlight immigrant contributions in US and their rights.

Billie’s comments follow a long confrontation with the Trump administration after federal agents shot and killed two U.S. citizens last month. Nurse Alex Pretti and mother Renée Good were fatally shot during a federal crackdown in Minnesota. Eilish had publicly referenced the Pretti and Good shootings in social media posts before the Grammys.

US President Donald Trump and other MAGA leaders slammed the Grammys for their opposition to government policies, especially regarding ICE. Nicki Minaj, who has been leaning toward the Republican side lately, was also mocked by host Trevor Noah at the award show.

Meet Júnior Pena: Pro-Trump Brazilian influencer who said only ‘crooks’ get deported is detained by ICE,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/meet-jnior-pena-pro-trump-brazilian-influencer-who-said-only-crooks-get-deported-is-detained-by-ice/articleshow/127873537.cms,"



A Brazilian influencer who publicly supported US President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has been detained by US immigration authorities, despite previously insisting that only criminals were targeted for deportation.Júnior Pena, whose full name is Eustáquio da Silva Pena Júnior, was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Saturday in New Jersey, according to Brazilian outlet Brazilian Times. Pena is known for his pro-Trump views and for posting videos about life in the United States as an immigrant.A source told the outlet that Pena’s detention was due to an administrative issue involving an immigration hearing. The hearing had reportedly been postponed, but the change was not properly recorded in the system, leading authorities to mark Pena as absent when he did not attend.Pena has a large online following, with around 1.3 million followers on TikTok and nearly 500,000 on Instagram. On his platforms, he often described the “reality of the USA” and openly voiced support for Trump.After Trump assumed office for his second term, the president promised an immigration crackdown that focused heavily on Latin American immigrants in its first six months.During that period, Pena told his Brazilian audience that those being targeted were criminals.“I wanted to tell you not to be so scared, there are many people scared. There are many influencers spreading fear among immigrants without having facts, evidence, or proof that so-and-so was deported,” Pena said in one video. He also claimed that those detained were “crooks.”The crackdown has led to the deaths of two American citizens named Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis and triggered protests against ICE across several states.According to a December report citing Brazil’s Federal Police, 2,268 Brazilian nationals were deported from the United States in 2025, the highest number recorded since data collection began in 2020.Pena came to the US in 2009 and is currently being held at Delaney Hall Detention Center in Newark while his lawyer, Andrew Lattarulo, works to block his transfer to another state.His detention has sparked strong reactions online, with social media accusing him of “self-sabotage” and warning that he promoted an unrealistic version of the American dream. A GoFundMe campaign was launched to cover legal and court costs, reaching its $32,000 goal by Monday.","Júnior Pena was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Saturday in New Jersey.

Nancy Guthrie, the 84‑year‑old mother of Savannah Guthrie, co‑anchor of NBC’s Today show, was reported missing from her home near Tucson, Arizona, and authorities are now treating the case as a possible crime, law enforcement officials said.Nancy was last seen at her home in the Catalina Foothills area north of Tucson on the evening of Saturday, January 31, according to the Pima County Sheriff’s Department. Her family reported her missing to police around noon on Sunday, February 1, after she failed to arrive at church and could not be reached.Sheriff Chris Nanos said there were concerning signs at the residence, and law enforcement has officially declared the home a crime scene. Officials said there is reason to believe Guthrie did not leave her house on her own.“Nancy Guthrie is of great sound mind,” a sheriff’s official said, noting that the 84‑year‑old has no known cognitive issues. However, she has physical limitations and requires daily medication, which could be life‑threatening if she goes without it for too long.Nancy is described by authorities as about 5 feet 5 inches tall, weighing around 150 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes.She lives alone at her residence near East Skyline Drive and North Campbell Avenue in Tucson.Law enforcement has launched a wide search effort, including volunteers, drones, helicopters and search dogs, but as of Monday Nancy had not been located. Sheriff Nanos said homicide detectives have been called in because of the unusual conditions found at her home.Savannah Guthrie was absent from the Today show on Monday as the search continued. In a statement read by colleagues on the broadcast, she thanked law enforcement and members of the public for their support and asked anyone with information to contact the Pima County Sheriff’s Department. Officials have asked neighbours to check home security footage and report anything unusual.No further details about Nancy’s disappearance have been released, and investigators have not identified any suspects.","Nancy Guthrie, 84, was reported missing from her home near Tucson, Arizona.

'I’ve never seen you smile': Donald Trump snaps at female reporter over Epstein question — Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ive-never-seen-you-smile-donald-trump-snaps-at-female-reporter-over-epstein-question-watch/articleshow/127899190.cms,"New Epstein Files Reveal FBI Tip Alleging Disturbing Trump-Epstein Conversation About 'Virgin' Girls





US President Donald Trump lashed out at a female reporter during a tense Oval Office exchange, snapping “You are the worst reporter” and telling her, “I don't think I've ever seen you smile,” after she pressed him about the latest Jeffrey Epstein document release.The confrontation unfolded when CNN’s Kaitlan Collins raised concerns about how the US Justice Department handled files linked to the convicted sex offender. She noted that “a lot of women who are survivors of Epstein are unhappy with” the redactions, adding that “entire witness interviews are totally blacked out.” Collins then asked what he would say to survivors who feel they have not received justice.Trump tried to shut down the line of questioning, replying: “I think it’s really time for the country to get on to something else, now that nothing came out about me”. He went further, saying, “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it's time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about. ”As Collins continued, Trump lashed out. “You are the worst reporter. CNN has no ratings because of people like you. I don't think I've ever seen you smile. For 10 years I've never seen a smile on your face.You know why you're not smiling? Because you know you're not telling the truth.” He added: “You are so bad. You know, you are the worst reporter. No wonder. CNN has no ratings because of people like you.”CNN later described Collins as “an exceptional journalist” who reports “with real depth and tenacity”. As reporters were ushered out of the Oval Office, Trump was heard repeating that “she never smiles” while gesturing towards the press.The clash came as the political and legal fallout from the Epstein document releases continued on both sides of the Atlantic. In the United States, prominent figures including Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton are due to testify before Congress. Neither Trump nor the Clintons have been accused of criminal wrongdoing connected to Epstein.In the UK, former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson resigned from the House of Lords amid controversy over his past links to Epstein, and British police said they were examining possible “misconduct in public office offenses”. The latest files have also revived scrutiny around Prince Andrew and others previously associated with the disgraced financier.","CNN’s Kaitlan Collins raised concerns about how the US Justice Department handled files linked to the convicted sex offender.

Second maritime incident reported

Iran signals shift toward negotiations

White House confirms planned talks

Turkey and regional states involved

Nuclear issue remains central





The US military shot down an Iranian drone near an American aircraft carrier early Tuesday, heightening tensions between Washington and Tehran just as both sides were preparing for possible diplomatic talks later this week.US Central Command said the drone “aggressively approached” a US Navy aircraft carrier just before sunrise Tuesday with “unclear intent.”The incident unfolded hours after Iran’s president signaled a willingness to negotiate with the United States.The drone continued flying toward the ship despite “deescalatory measures taken by US forces operating in international waters,” Central Command spokesman Capt. Tim Hawkins said.An F-35C fighter jet from the USS Abraham Lincoln shot down the Shahed-139 drone. The aircraft carrier was sailing about 500 miles (805 kilometers) from Iran’s southern coast at the time, Hawkins said.Later Tuesday, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces harassed a merchant vessel flying the American flag and carrying an American crew, according to Central Command.Two boats and an Iranian Mohajer drone approached the Stena Imperative “at high speeds and threatened to board and seize the tanker,” Hawkins said.The British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said the incident appeared to have occurred in Iranian territorial waters. Iran had warned in recent days that the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard would conduct naval drills.The US destroyer USS McFaul responded and escorted the Stena Imperative with defensive air support. Central Command said the vessel is now sailing safely.Earlier Tuesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said he instructed Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to “pursue fair and equitable negotiations” with the United States.The statement marked a significant turn for Pezeshkian, a reformist who has warned for weeks that unrest in Iran had moved beyond his control. It also suggested backing from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has previously dismissed talks with Washington.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that US special envoy Steve Witkoff has been planning to hold talks with Iranian officials in Turkey later this week, marking the first direct acknowledgment by the White House.“These talks, as of right now, are still scheduled,” Leavitt said when asked whether the drone incident could affect the plans.“President Trump is always wanting to pursue diplomacy first, but obviously it takes two to tango,” she said. “You need a willing partner to achieve diplomacy and that’s something that special envoy Witkoff is intent on exploring and discussing.”Turkey has been working behind the scenes to facilitate the talks as Witkoff travels through the region. A Turkish official said the location of the talks remained uncertain but that Turkey was prepared to support the process.Foreign ministers from Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have also been invited to attend, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity.The prospects for an agreement remain unclear, particularly as US President Donald Trump has added Iran’s nuclear program to a list of demands.Trump ordered the bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites during the 12-day war Israel launched against Iran in June.“Right now, we’re talking to them, we’re talking to Iran, and if we could work something out, that’d be great,” Trump said Monday. “And if we can’t, probably bad things would happen.”","US Central Command said the drone “aggressively approached” a US Navy aircraft carrier.

Indian-origin taxi driver Gurmeet Singh to be stripped of US citizenship over rape; hid crime during naturalisation process,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-origin-taxi-driver-gurmeet-singh-to-be-stripped-of-us-citizenship-over-rape-hid-crime-during-naturalisation-process/articleshow/127897402.cms,"



The US Department of Justice has announced that it is seeking to revoke the citizenship of Gurmeet Singh , an Indian-origin man who became a naturalised US citizen after hiding a previous conviction for rape.The DOJ said Singh lied about his criminal history when he applied for US citizenship. He had previously kidnapped and sexually assaulted a female passenger in his taxi.The incident occurred after the woman fell asleep in the backseat of his car. Singh allegedly drove her to a side street, where she awoke to find him on top of her, holding a knife to her throat. He reportedly warned her to stop resisting if she wanted to live, then bound, gagged, blindfolded, and raped her.Singh became a US citizen on October 19, 2011, after hiding these acts during his naturalisation process. He was later convicted in May 2014 in New York of first-degree rape and second-degree kidnapping as a sexually motivated felony and sentenced to 20 years in prison.Taking away citizenship or Denaturalisation can only happen through a federal court ruling. It is a complicated process and is used only when someone lied to get citizenship or committed serious crimes.People born in the US cannot lose their citizenship. Only naturalised citizens can.Moreover, the Trump administration has reportedly told United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) offices to send 100 to 200 cases a month to the Justice Department for 2026, like the Singh one. For comparison, only about 120 cases were filed across the country between 2017 and 2025. The process puts pressure on the courts, but it helps protect the value of US citizenship according to some Republicans.US Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a press release: “This Department of Justice will continue to strip citizenship from those who commit heinous crimes and conceal them during the naturalization process. American citizenship is a great and sacred privilege that must be earned honestly.”US Attorney Joseph Nocella Jr. also weighed in on Singh's case: “The defendant in this case secured U.S. citizenship through deceit, and on the heels of committing the heinous crimes of rape and kidnapping. This case, brought to strip the defendant of citizenship that he did not earn and to which he was not entitled, demonstrates our Office’s commitment to protecting the American people and defending the sanctity of U.S. citizenship.”Singh’s case will now be heard in federal court, where a judge will decide whether the government has met the legal standard required to revoke his citizenship.","Gurmeet Singh became a US citizen on October 19, 2011, after hiding these acts during his naturalisation process.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has lodged an arrest detainer against Mena Mohsen Farez Nmn Awad, an Egyptian national, after he was charged with raping a 16-year-old girl while she slept in her own bed in Nashville, Tennessee.According to local reports, on December 31, 2025, Awad broke into the minor girl’s apartment. She was lying next to her nephew when she awoke to find Awad with a handgun tucked into his waistband, committing the assault. After freeing herself, the victim grabbed her nephew and told Awad she would not report the attack if he left.Following the incident, the victim contacted her sister, who alerted the authorities. A search led to Awad being apprehended by police in Louisville, Kentucky, on January 16, 2026. He was extradited to Tennessee the following week and charged with aggravated rape with a weapon, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and aggravated burglary.Awad was admitted to the US via the Green Card Lottery system, according to the Department of Homeland Security.“Horrendous immigration policies allowed this monster into our country and made victims of children and families,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.She added, “This child rapist was allowed into our country by the Diversity Lottery program. Secretary Noem paused the diversity lottery to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program. ICE lodged an arrest detainer to ensure he is not released onto our streets to victimise more children.”Since entering the United States in 2017 under the Diversity Lottery programme, Awad has accumulated a long criminal record, including domestic violence, intimidation, possession of a weapon, violation of a court order, and vehicle theft.ICE has placed Awad in removal proceedings and lodged a detainer to prevent him from being released into US communities while legal action continues.","Mena Mohsen Farez Nmn Awad, an Egyptian national, was charged with raping a 16-year-old girl while she slept in her own bed in Nashville, Tennessee.

Texas journalist 'exposes' Indian recruiters behind 'H-1B only' job ads on LinkedIn: 'When I call the numbers...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/texas-journalist-exposes-indian-recruiters-behind-h-1b-only-job-ads-on-linkedin-when-i-call-the-numbers-/articleshow/127894199.cms,"



Texas journalist Sara Gonzales, who knocked on the doors of a few H-1B addresses in Texas, exposing a 'major scam' in the state, has now targeted Indian recruiters offering 'H-1B only' jobs at various US locations on LinkedIn. Gonzales said she visited the websites of the companies and found a common pattern: most of the contact numbers given on the sites do not work, the companies have their offices in India; they have unpolished/ wrong choice of English words on their sites; and they rent out virtual remote coworking space so that they can have an address but no one is there.""Let me be clear to the fraudsters. We are not done. Keep watching. It may be you we are exposing very shortly,"" Gonzales said. The journalist added that it was her expose that prompted Texas Governor Greg Abbott to announce a freeze on H-1B hiring ban in state agencies. Also, Texas AG Ken Paxton announced an investigation into three private companies.Gonzales said she researched for an evening and found an avalanche of information about Indian recruiters posting 'H-1B only' ads on LinkedIn. Revealing their names and the companies they have been hiring for, Gonzales read out one advertisement that was offering jobs only for H-4s, who are dependents of H-1Bs.""This is the whole scheme. You get in, you get to bring your whole family, you bring your children. Then your children need to be taught by another H-1B. And that H-1B brings their family in, and they bring their children. It is a recurring, never-ending cycle,"" Gonzales said adding that H-1B is supposed to be used only when American talent is not found for some very niche skills.The IT consulting firms are double-dipping as they don't pay what they get from the companies to the H-1Bs they hire, the journalist alleged. ""If you are a Green Card holder, if you did immigrate to this country, if you came to this country as a foreign national and paid your dues, and you are now a Green Card holder, you still do not need to apply. We don't want you. We want the non-immigrant visas. What a slap in the face,"" Gonzales said.","Texas journalist Sara Gonzales has targeted Indian recruiters offering 'H-1B only' jobs at various US locations on LinkedIn.

'More reason to deport every Indian': Florida Republican leader on Texas loss 'because of an Indian voting bloc',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/more-reason-to-deport-every-indian-florida-republican-leader-on-texas-loss-because-of-an-indian-voting-bloc/articleshow/127890431.cms,"‘Liam Is Home!’: 5-Year-Old Boy, Father FINALLY Freed From Texas ICE Centre After Minneapolis Raid





As many Indian-Americans claimed that Republicans lost the election of Senate District 9 in Texas because of their growing hatred against Indians and Hindus, Florida Republican leader Chandler Langevin said this should be all the more reason to deport every Indian in Texas. ""If Republicans lost a special election because of an Indian voting bloc…then they have all the more reason to deport every Indian in Texas,"" Langevin said.In the past few weeks, North Texas has emerged as a seat of India-hatred pushed by politicians, American influencers, and social media commentators. While influencers claimed Texas has become a new place culturally after 'Indian takeover', social media commentators said Texas jobs are going to Indians, prompting Texas Governor Greg Abbott to announce an H-1B freeze in hiring in state agencies and universities. Texas AG Ken Paxton announced an investigation into three Indian firms that hired H-1B employees in past, asking them to furnish details of each of the employees. A major gold scam involving many Indians and Indian jewelry stores has also been busted in Texas.The loss in a local election in Texas sent MAGA into such a meltdown that a MAGA handle mistook Democrat Taylor Rehmet, who won the election, as an Indian -- going by the 'Rehmet' part of the name.Many MAGA commentators blamed Indian-American voters in the county for the loss -- though the number of Indian-American voters in the county would not have led to the swing, records revealed.President Donald Trump distanced himself from the defeat, though he endorsed Republican candidate Leigh Wambsganss. ""I’m not involved in that. That’s a local Texas race,"" Trump said after the stunning loss. Rehmet said Trump was a non-factor in the local poll and he was focused on the community.Hindu American Foundation executive director Suhag Shukla said Republicans did not have winning strategies with ICE agents shooting people in the streets, racist attacks being hurled on Indian-Americans and politicians calling for shutting down Hindu temples.The Indian-American Advocacy Council said Republicans didn’t lose because of ""Indian voting bloc"" as Indian-Americans are under 2% of the population in the county that went to the election. ""They lost because there are millions of decent, good-faith Americans who don’t want racism, xenophobia, and trash politics running their communities. That’s the truth. And we LOVE each and every one of those Americans. They are on OUR TEAM and there's nothing you can do about it,"" the council posted, replying to Langevin's comment.","Florida Republican leader Chandler Langevin said this should be all the more reason to deport every Indian in Texas.
