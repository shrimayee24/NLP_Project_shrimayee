42 Muslims in batch of 50: J&K CM says Vaishno Devi college admissions are merit-based; BJP seeks changes — what’s the row?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/42-muslims-in-batch-of-50-jk-cm-says-vaishno-devi-college-admissions-are-merit-based-bjp-seeks-changes-whats-the-row/articleshow/125554717.cms,"What sparked the controversy?



'Seats should be for Mata Vaishno Devi devotees'



'Our constitution has the word secular'



NEW DELHI: Admissions into the newly established Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence in Jammu and Kashmir has sparked a political row after 42 Muslim students were selected in a batch of 50.The Bharatiya Janata Party, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal protested, with the BJP demanding cancellation of admission list and questioning the merit of the students who got admission. Meanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah called dismissed such accusations saying that the admissions were based on merit.The political row erupted after the medical college completed admissions through NEET’s merit list earlier this month. The college admitted students on NEET merit and allocated 85% of its seats to J&K residents. Eight Hindu students from Jammu were selected for the inaugural MBBS batch of 50.Following the completion of admissions, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal staged the initial protests, claiming that a college financed by the Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board should prioritise Hindu candidates.They further argued that, as the institution is supported by donations from Hindu devotees, it ought to advance Hindu interests.Officials maintained that admissions were merit-based since the institute lacked minority status and therefore could not apply any religion-based reservations.The Hindu outfit organisations demanded ""minority"" institution status for the medical college. Meanwhile, BJP demanded that the admissions should be given to those who have faith in ""Mata Vaishno Devi"", arguing that ""donations to the shrine board come from Hindus, for the welfare of Hindus.""“Donations to the shrine board come from Hindus, for the welfare of Hindus. We are upset with the board and the college because they did not consider this sentiment. We told the LG that only those who have faith in Mata Vaishno Devi should get admission. This year’s admission is not acceptable to people here. The rules should be changed,” said BJP’s Sunil Sharma, who lodged a protest with J&K LG Manoj Sinha.Criticising the outrage over the admissions, J&K CM Omar Abdullah said that the admissions were ""merit-based"" and those who wanted admissions otherwise should ""take permission from the Supreme Court"". He further questioned the BJP's demands saying that ""if you do not want to keep this country secular, remove that word"".“Some people do not seem to like merit-based admissions. If you want admissions without merit, take permission from the Supreme Court because as far as I know, you cannot give admission without merit,"" he said.“There is a demand that admissions be given on the basis of religion, by keeping merit aside, which is not permissible according to the Constitution. Will police perform their duty on the basis of religion,” the chief minister asked. “Our constitution has the word ‘secular’. If you do not want to keep this country secular, remove that word,"" he added.Regarding Sharma’s assertion that LG promised to review their demands to scrap the admission list and introduce reservations in the future, Abdullah said, “How can anyone assure such a thing? Then why are you separating the Mata Vaishno Devi University and the hospital? Then say that the hospital was set up from the donations received at the shrine, and that Muslims and non-Hindus won’t be allowed to get treatment there. ”",The political row erupted after the medical college completed admissions through NEET’s merit list.

‘Strong demarche was made with the Chinese side’



NEW DELHI: An Indian citizen from Arunachal Pradesh was held for over 18 hours in Shanghai airport after Chinese officials declared her Indian passport invalid.Prema Wangjom Thongdok, said she is an Indian citizen living in the UK for about 14 years. The ordeal occurred while she was traveling from London’s Gatwick to Japan via a transit in Shanghai.Describing her harrowing experience she told ANI, “I had basically crossed e-gates, standing in the queue for my next flight, and then one of the officials from the Chinese immigration came over and singled me out of the queue. I asked her what was happening, she didn’t say much, just asked me to follow her. And she went on to say, 'Arunachal- not India, China-China, your visa is not acceptable. Your passport is invalid. 'She further went on to narrate the alleged misbehavior of the officials at the airport, accusing them of “mocking” and “laughing” at her.“When I tried to question them, they said, 'Arunachal is not part of India' and started mocking and laughing, saying things like 'you should apply for the Chinese passport, you're Chinese, you're not Indian.’”She added that she had transited through Shanghai previously without issue and described the experience as humiliating, with airport and airline staff allegedly laughing and pointing at her passport.Thongdok also claimed that she had already consulted the Chinese embassy in London regarding the transit and she was assured that no visa would be required for a layover.Thongdok claimed she couldn't reach out for any help from anyone as there were wifi issues and social platforms like Google and Whatsapp don’t work in the country.She was eventually assisted by Indian embassy officials from Shanghai and Beijing, who helped resolve the issue and provided support during the prolonged wait. She said she was finally able to leave the airport around 10:30PM.Thongdok went on to add, , ""... We are part of India... We speak 'shuddh Hindi', we don't understand C of Chinese, we are all Indian... I want to raise this awareness that residents of the northeast of India should not face such harassment in terms of being called and being told that you are not a part of the country that you're so proudly a citizen of. I would like the government of India to raise this on a diplomatic level with the Chinese authorities. This is not something a regular citizen can resolve. I would just like to request the government of India to take strict action against the Chinese authorities and the government on such matters...""She further told ANI, after her return she reached out to the higher up authorities in the country, writing to them via mails, requesting such incident not be repeated.I wrote an email to the ministry of external affairs, PMO, CM of Arunachal Pradesh, foreign secretary, that such an incident shouldn't happen to someone who is just a normal citizen…”Thongdok referred to the incident as a possible hassle tactic used by Chinese officials to harass Indian citizens, especially as it was the weekend so there would be less chance of an official intervention, as government offices are closed.“Just to be harassed for so many hours, I think it might be quite a tactic used by the Chinese government to hassle citizens of India, especially from Arunachal Pradesh... I'm just grateful to the team from the Indian embassy who helped me get out of there finally.”Before the interview with ANI she had posted about her order on X, tagging government authorities including Union minister Kiran Rijiju who himself hails from Arunachal Pradesh, and PMO office, highlighting the extended detention and questioning of her citizenship based on her birthplace.Thongdok wrote, “ @pemakhandu @kirenrijuju @PMOIndia I was held at Shanghai airport for over 18 hrs on 21st Nov, 2025 on claims by China immigration & @chinaeasternair They called my Indian passport invalid as my birthplace is Arunachal Pradesh which they claimed is Chinese territory.”ANI citing sources claimed, a “strong demarche was made with the Chinese side, in Beijing and in Delhi, on the same day the incident took place. Our Consulate in Shanghai also took up the matter locally and extended fullest assistance to the stranded passenger.”It was asserted Arunachal Pradesh is an ‘indisputably Indian territory,’ calling the reason for detention as ‘ludicrous.’“It was stressed that the passenger had been detained on ludicrous grounds. Arunachal Pradesh is indisputably Indian territory and its residents are perfectly entitled to hold and travel with Indian passports. ⁠It has also been highlighted that the actions of the Chinese authorities are in contravention of the Chicago and Montreal Conventions relating to civil aviation.”The actions were termed “ unnecessary obstructions” to restoring normalcy in the bilateral ties between the two sides.“At a time when both sides are working on restoring normalcy, such actions by the Chinese side introduce unnecessary obstructions to the process.”",An Indian citizen from Arunachal Pradesh was held for over 18 hours in Shanghai airport after Chinese officials declared her Indian passport invalid.

‘Fake news’: French navy slams Pakistan media over misinformation on Operation Sindoor; calls Rafale claims fabricated,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fake-news-french-navy-slams-pakistan-media-over-misinformation-on-operation-sindoor-calls-rafale-claims-fabricated/articleshow/125518149.cms,"French navy slams Pakistan's misinformation campaign

'Objective Is To Destroy The Enemy': Op Sindoor Echoes As Indian Army Vows Stronger Response to Pak

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DLEHI: The French Navy on Sunday criticised Pakistani media for publishing what it described as “misinformation and disinformation” about India’s Operation Sindoor , after one outlet claimed a French officer had confirmed Pakistani air superiority and the shooting down of Indian Rafale jets during a border confrontation earlier this year in May.In a statement issued on its official X handle, the ‘Marine Nationale’ said the article had fabricated comments and even misidentified the officer involved.“FAKENEWS: These statements were attributed to Captain Launay who never gave his consent for any form of publication. The article contains extensive misinformation and disinformation,” the post said. Pakistan based broadcaster Geo TV’s November 21 report had quoted a “Jacques Launay” as allegedly praising the Pakistan air force during a supposed May 6–7 aerial engagement involving over 140 fighters, and claiming Indian Rafales were downed with Chinese support. The French Navy said the officer’s real name is Captain Yvan Launay - and none of the comments attributed to him were genuine.Clarifying his actual role, the Navy said: “First name is Yvan, not Jacquis. Contrary to what has been established in the article, his responsibilities are limited to commanding the organic naval air station where the French Rafale Marine aircraft are stationed.”According to the statement, Captain Launay’s presentation at the Indo-Pacific conference was strictly technical.“Captain Yvan Launay presented the assets of his naval air base, the missions of the Rafale fighter jet, and the French carrier strike group concept,” it said.Responding to questions at the event, Launay “neither confirmed nor denied that Indian aircrafts had been shot down” during Operation Sindoor and “refused to comment on possible jamming of the Indian Rafale by Chinese systems.” The Navy added that “he never mentioned the Chinese J10.”These clarifications directly contradicted another claim published by the Pakistani outlet, which had said Launay linked alleged Rafale performance issues to operational shortcomings and compared the jet with the Chinese J-10C. The Navy reiterated that such references were never made.The BJP spokesperson and its IT cell chief Amit Malviya reacting to the post by French navy called out the Geo TV's report as ""same old, fabricated claims."" He also took a dig at the journalist behind it Hamid Mir.In a post on X he said, ""The French Navy has called out Pakistan’s Geo TV and its correspondent Hamid Mir for spreading “misinformation and disinformation.” In his report, Hamid Mir peddled the same old, fabricated claims about Rafales and the so-called May conflict and has now been publicly exposed. When official institutions start debunking their propaganda, you know how desperate Pakistan’s misinformation machinery has become. Incidentally Hamid Mir has several friends in Indian media. Spot them.""France’s rebuttal comes days after a US report by US-China Economic and Review Commission exposed how in aftermath of Operation Sindoor, China initiated a “disinformation campaign” to “hinder the sales of French Rafale aircraft in favour of its own J-35s, using fake social media accounts to propagate AI images of supposed debris from the planes that China’s weapon destroyed.”The Operation Sindoor was launched in response to the dastardly Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu & Kashmir on April 22 earlier this year, in which 26 civilians were killed - the incident later prompted Indian response targeting Pakistan-sponsored terrorist sites.",French navy slams Pakistan's misinformation campaign about India's Operation Sindoor.

NEW DELHI: Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind (JUH) president Maulana Arshad Madani's remarks alleging discrimination against Muslims while citing the example of Al-Falah University, which is under the scanner in the Delhi blast probe, have triggered a storm. Accusing the govt of working relentlessly to ensure that Muslims don't progress, Madani claimed that while Zohran Mamdani and Sadiq Khan could become the mayors of New York and London, respectively, Muslims in India cannot even become vice chancellors of universities.""And even if someone does, they will be sent to jail, like Azam Khan. Look at what is happening today with Al-Falah. He (the founder) is in jail, and how many years he will spend in jail, no one knows,"" Madani, chief of one of the two JUH factions, said, speaking at a session at Jamiat headquarters in Delhi Saturday.The founder of Al-Falah University, Jawed Siddiqui, is in custody of the Enforcement Directorate. Besides the current probe, it is alleged that Siddiqui was held in Delhi in an earlier case following a complaint of cheating and spent over two years in Tihar jail. He came out on bail in Feb 2004 and was later acquitted in the case by court the next year, after he and his brother agreed to make repayments.Madani said, ""The govt, since the time India got freedom, has been working on preventing Muslims from raising their heads.It is the result of this that today you hear people saying that there is a lack of leadership among Muslims."" Citing a Hindi idiom, he said the govt wants the Muslims ""to feel the ground slipping under their feet"", and ""it is happening...""BJP netas hit back on Sunday over Madani's remarks. Party spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla told PTI, ""In the name of vote bank, the 'bhaijann of appeasement' and the 'aatanki bachao jamaat (save terrorists group)' has become active."" He added, ""Arshad Madani ji, leave aside this talk of mayor; this country has seen Muslims becoming president, vice president, chief justice, home minister. The biggest artists and businessmen have also come from the Muslim community. "" BJP member Shahnawaz Hussain slammed Madani's statement as ""very irresponsible"".However, some Congress netas saw merit in Madani's remarks. Former MP Sandeep Dikshit said, ""This govt has launched a very systematic campaign against a particular religion."" At the same time, he made it clear that Madani's linking the issue to Al-Falah is not right. ""I hope that in the case of Al-Falah doctors, the NIA will conduct an impartial probe,"" he said.Congress' Rashid Alvi said, ""Take strict action against those who are responsible, who are terrorists, spreading terror, breaking the law, whoever they may be. But that doesn't mean you destroy the entire university,"" he said.","Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind (JUH) president Maulana Arshad Madani's remarks alleging discrimination against Muslims have triggered a storm.

DEHRADUN: In a significant show of combat readiness, Indian Army 's Western Command carried out a month-long integrated ground and air drill involving over 20,000 personnel, simulating offensive operations across the Pakistan border in Punjab.The exercise, which was first of its kind held in Uttarakhand by the Army, concluded near Haridwar on Saturday and was held in terrain mimicking the riverside plains of Punjab.The 'Ram Prahar' exercise was conducted by the Ram division of the Kharga Corps under Western Command. Though the location operationally falls under Central Command, army officials said it was chosen due to geographical similarities with the Punjab sector. The exercise included fighter jets, reconnaissance aircraft, Apache attack helicopters, amphibious armoured vehicles, tanks, drone-based surveillance, and night-time paratrooper deployment.General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Western Command, Lieutenant General Manoj Kumar Katiyar, who inspected and validated the final phase of the drill, said it focused on rehearsing responses to major provocations by Pakistan.""In the recent Operation Sindoor, we delivered a robust response, which resulted in extensive damage to Pakistani forces. But we doubt whether it has learnt any lesson. If there is another mischief by it, we are prepared to respond with far greater force, including entering Pakistan from Punjab,"" he said. He added that the location was selected as it allowed simulation of riverine obstacles similar to those found in Punjab. ""We conduct exercises in operational areas under other commands too to ensure readiness,"" he said.A senior Army officer involved in the exercise told TOI, requesting anonymity, that the drill tested operational agility, multi-domain capabilities and real-time coordination across land, air and cyber domains.Lt Gen Mohan Bhandari (retired), former deputy director general of military operations during the Kargil war, told TOI the drill was vital to test preparedness for the Punjab sector.""Pakistan has constructed numerous canals in Punjab to act as barriers against our armoured and mechanised units. Exercises simulating such conditions enhance operational efficiency because ultimate victory comes under the boots of infantry on enemy land,"" said Lt Gen Bhandari (retired)who conducted similar drills during his time in Western Command.","The 'Ram Prahar' exercise was conducted by the Ram division of the Kharga Corps under Western Command.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Monday said that the ""pollution of Marx and Mao"" is denser in the brains of the agitators after slogans condemning Naxal commander Hidma's encounter were raised during a protest over rising air pollution levels in Delhi.During a press conference, BJP leader Sudhanshu Trivedi said that the ""real face"" of protestors was out soon as they started raising slogans in support of a slain Naxal commander.""Some people reached India Gate with a mask on their faces that they are there to protest against the pollution. The masks were off as soon as they reached there, and the real face was out, and they started raising slogans in support of a slain Naxal commander,"" the BJP leader said.He also latched on the incident to target Congress and claimed that the party ""dreams"" of coming to power with the support of the extremists.""The PM has said that the Congress has become the Muslim League-Maoist. More than the air pollution, the pollution of Marx and Mao is denser in their brains. Along with that, they dream of coming to power with the support of extremist 'Kathmullas'.

Security forces had said the group initiated firing during a cordon-and-search operation, sparking an extended encounter.Meanwhile, Delhi Police also arrested 15 activist on charges of obstructing its personnel and assaulting them, besides blocking the road during the protest.Patiala House Court remanded 5 accused in 2 days' judicial custody. The court has asked the police to file a copy of the videos in the court.Additionally, the court asked to send one accused to a safe house till his age is verified, as he has claimed to be a minor.The situation at the protest escalated as some demonstrators allegedly used pepper spray on police personnel while being removed from the scene, the official said.""The situation then turned into a scuffle, and some protesters used pepper spray on our personnel, which is unusual and rare,"" the officer said, adding that so far, police have arrested at least 15 protesters.When asked about slogans allegedly raised in support of Maoist leader Madvi Hidma, the officer said they are probing the matter from all angles.The Delhi Coordination Committee for Clean Air, in a statement, said the city's worsening air quality has become a ""serious risk"" to public health and alleged that authorities have failed to address the root causes of pollution.It further alleged that air quality has remained in the ""severe"" category, while the government relies on ""cosmetic measures"" such as water sprinklers, cloud seeding and spraying near Air Quality Index (AQI) stations instead of finding long-term solutions to tackle the issue.Meanwhile, Scientists for Society (SFS), one of the organisations that participated in Sunday's ""Delhi Against Clean Air"" protest here, has distanced itself from certain groups that allegedly raised slogans unrelated to the protest’s central theme of air pollution.In a statement issued on Monday, the SFS said it had joined the protest “solely on the issue of pollution” and emphasised that the primary objective of the demonstration was to highlight Delhi's severe air quality crisis, educate citizens, and question what they described as the government's “failure and unwillingness” to act.","BJP leader Sudhanshu Trivedi said that the ""real face"" of protestors was out soon as they started raising slogans in support of a slain Naxal commander.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday sought the investigation status report from NIA which was tasked to investigate alleged extra-judicial killings of 10 Kuki-Zo tribal youth in Nov last year, a year and half after ethnic strife engulfed the state, allegedly by CRPF in Jiribam district.A bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and A S Chandurkar refused to act on the plea for five Kuki-Zo community members seeking a court monitored SIT to inquire into the more than one year incident saying already one of the best agencies in NIA is seized of the investigation.However, the bench agreed with the petitioner and sought a probe status report from NIA regarding the progress made in the investigation so far. The petitioners said they cannot approach Manipur HC ""because they belong to the minority community who are at loggerheads with the majority community, and as such, the HC being in Imphal city, they are not in a position to go there physically because of constant threats to life and property"".According to the petitioners, the incident took place when the ten men belonging to Hmar tribe of Kuki-Zo community, claiming to be relief volunteers from Churachandpur, went inside CRPF premises at Borobekra police station in Jiribam district for talks regarding security of villages in the area as a day before their villages were attacked.""It is learnt that as the ten were leaving from the compound, a Manipur police commando in the compound opened fire on them... It was rumoured that in the commotion, a CRPF soldier opened fire from LMG which killed several of those, 10 victims.""","Supreme Court Monday sought the investigation status report from NIA.

Invoking criminal law when ties sour a disturbing trend: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/invoking-criminal-law-when-ties-sour-a-disturbing-trend-sc/articleshow/125550466.cms,"NEW DELHI: That criminal law is often being invoked when a consensual relationship between adults goes sour is a matter of profound concern, Supreme Court remarked Monday, quashing criminal proceedings against a lawyer against whom a rape complaint was filed by his client. The woman had alleged that she got into a physical relationship with her lawyer after he promised to marry her, only to back out later. Interestingly, the lawyer was representing the woman in divorce proceedings when the two got into a relationship.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan said it is not a case where a person was lured solely for physical gratification and then dumped, given that the relationship continued for three years during which the two remained close and emotionally involved. ""In such cases, physical intimacy that occurred during the course of a functioning relationship cannot be retrospectively branded as an instance of offence of rape merely because the relationship failed to culminate in marriage,"" the court said.""This court has, on numerous occasions, taken note of the disquieting tendency wherein failed or broken relationships are given the colour of criminality. The offence of rape, being of the gravest kind, must be invoked only in cases where there exists genuine sexual violence, coercion or absence of free consent.To convert every sour relationship into an offence of rape not only trivialises the seriousness of the offence but also inflicts upon the accused indelible stigma and grave injustice. Such instances transcend the realm of mere personal discord. The misuse of the criminal justice machinery in this regard is a matter of profound concern and calls for condemnation,"" it said.At the same time, it accepted the institution of marriage holds deep social and cultural significance, and it is therefore not uncommon for a woman to repose complete faith in her partner and consent to physical intimacy on the assurance the relationship would culminate in a lawful and socially recognised marriage.""'In such circumstances, the promise of marriage becomes the very foundation of her consent, rendering it conditional rather than absolute. It is, thus, conceivable that such consent may stand vitiated where it is established that the promise of marriage was illusory, made in bad faith, and with no genuine intention of fulfilment, solely to exploit the woman. The law must remain sensitive to such genuine cases where trust has been breached and dignity violated, lest the protective scope of IPC section 376 be reduced to a mere formality for those truly aggrieved. At the same time, the invocation of this principle must rest upon credible evidence..."" it said.","A woman had alleged that she got into a physical relationship with her lawyer after he promised to marry her, only to back out later.

NEW DELHI: An Indian was detained for nearly 18 hours by Chinese immigration authorities at Shanghai's Pudong International Airport on Nov 21, after officials allegedly refused to recognise her Indian passport because her birthplace was listed as Arunachal Pradesh.Pema Wang Thongdok, who was travelling from London to Japan with a transit stop in Shanghai, stated that immigration officers declared her passport ""invalid"", insisting that Arunachal Pradesh was ""part of China"" and therefore could not appear as a birthplace on an Indian document.In a series of posts on X, Thongdok said officials seized her passport, blocked her from boarding her onward flight despite holding a valid Japanese visa, denied her access to food and other basic facilities, and repeatedly mocked her, telling her she should apply for a Chinese passport. She alleged China Eastern Airlines staff also forced her to buy a fresh ticket before returning her passport. Thongdok said she contacted the Indian consulate in Shanghai through a friend in the UK, and consular intervention eventually allowed her to exit the airport late that night and continue her journey.Calling the incident a direct affront to India's sovereignty, she urged that protections be put in place for citizens from Arunachal.India lodged a strong protest with China both here and in Beijing, saying that at a time when both sides were working on restoring normalcy in ties, such actions introduced unnecessary obstructions to the process.The Indian consulate in Shanghai also took up the matter locally. ""It was stressed that the passenger had been detained on ludicrous grounds. Arunachal Pradesh is indisputably Indian territory and its residents are perfectly entitled to hold and travel with Indian passports,"" said a source.Govt sources also said that the actions of the Chinese authorities were in contravention of the Chicago and Montreal Conventions relating to civil aviation that establish basic rules for international air travel.In a social media post, Congress wrote: ""This kind of treatment cannot be tolerated with any Indian. The Modi govt should lodge a strong objection with China on this matter. Modi ji, this is the right time to show China your 'red eyes' and respond.""Earlier this year, China released a list of names for 27 places in Arunachal.

The session was called to pay tributes to Guru Tegh Bahadur.The Punjab government is organising a series of events from November 23-25 as part of the 350th martyrdom anniversary of the ninth Sikh Guru.Earlier, the House also passed another resolution to draw inspiration from Guru Tegh Bahadur's life and teachings to work towards the welfare and prosperity of the people of Punjab, promoting peace, tolerance and harmony in society.According to a resolution moved by Education Minister and local MLA Harjot Singh Bains, the House expressed its deepest reverence and humbly bows down to the Sikh Guru in respect, devotion and faith.The House resolved to pay its humble tributes to Guru Tegh Bahadur and honour his memory by observing his 350th martyrdom anniversary with due solemnity and reverence.The resolution also commended the Punjab government's efforts in organising various events and programmes to commemorate the occasion of the 350th year of martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadur, including the special assembly session, 'Nagar Kirtans', 'Kirtan Darbars', light and sound shows, drone shows and an 'Sarv Dharam Sammelan' (interfaith conference).The House also resolved to continue promoting values of secularism, universal brotherhood and human rights, as exemplified by Guru Tegh Bahadur, as per the resolution.Participating in a discussion on the resolution, Bains said school students in Punjab were taught about the Guru's history during the morning assemblies. Seminars dedicated to Guru Tegh Bahadur were organised in all colleges and universities in the state, he said.Hailing the ninth Sikh Guru's supreme sacrifice, BSP MLA Nachhatar Pal demanded that Rupnagar district be named after Guru Tegh Bahadur or be changed to Anandpur Sahib.Leader of Opposition Partap Singh Bajwa too spoke about the supreme sacrifice Guru Tegh Bahadur, saying it is a moving testament to his unwavering commitment to the principles of freedom of religion and human dignity.Bajwa raised the issues of Chandigarh, Panjab University, pending rural development fund and water sharing and said all Punjabis should come together for the state's rights.

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said the borders ""can change"" as he hinted that Sindh, which went to Pakistan during Partition, could ""return to India again someday,"" stressing the region's deep civilisational ties with the country.Speaking at an event, he said, “Today, the land of Sindh may not be a part of India, but civilisationally, Sindh will always be a part of India. And as far as land is concerned, borders can change. Who knows, tomorrow Sindh may return to India again.”The minister referred to the Sindh province along the Indus River, noting that many Sindhi families migrated to India after 1947. Citing former deputy PM and BJP stalwart LK Advani, he said Sindhi Hindus of that generation had never fully reconciled with the separation.“Lal Krishna Advani wrote in one of his books that Sindhi Hindus, especially those of his generation, still haven't accepted the separation of Sindh from India,” Singh said.He cited Advani to underline that the Indus River’s importance goes far beyond geography. “Not just in Sindh, but throughout India, Hindus consider the Indus River sacred. Many Muslims in Sindh also believed that the water of the Indus was no less sacred than the Aab-e-Zamzam of Mecca.This is Advani ji's quote.”Reiterating the emotional link, Singh said, “Our people of Sindh, who hold the Indus River sacred, will always be our own. No matter where they are, they will always be ours.”Also read: French navy slams Pakistan media over misinformation on Operation Sindoor; calls Rafale claims fabricated Singh also recalled his efforts to provide proper citizenship via law to various immigrant Sindhi families after his visit to the community in Delhi back in 2019, describing their living conditions as ""distressing."" He went on to add that because of NDA being in minority in Rajya Sabha back then, the bill collapsed in the upper house, but Amit Shah taking over the home affairs continued the work in the direction, a possible reference to Citizenship Amendment Act.""People from the Sindhi community and various other non-Muslim groups had fled to Delhi, where they were living in slums in extremely distressing conditions. I personally went to see them. After returning, I decided that we would enact whatever laws were necessary to grant them proper citizenship. I spoke to Prime Minister Modi and apprised him that I was moving forward in this direction. The bill was prepared, I introduced it in the Lok Sabha, and it was passed there. But it was the final phase of 2019, only a few months were left, and we did not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha. I spoke to several opposition leaders, but they refused to support it. I said that if it didn’t pass that year, it would certainly be passed the next year. Later, when Amit Shah became the Home Minister, I spoke to him, and he took the work forward,"" he added.Earlier in September while interacting with the Indian community in Morocco, Singh had expressed confidence that Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) would integrate with India “without aggressive steps”.“PoK will be ours on its own. Demands have started being made in PoK, you must have heard sloganeering,” he had said then.","Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the borders ""can change"" as he hinted that Sindh, which went to Pakistan during Partition, could ""return to India again someday"" Citing former deputy PM and BJP stalwart LK Advani, he said Sindhi Hindus had never fully reconciled with the separation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125521493,imgsize-609930,width-400,resizemode-4/defence-minister-rajnath-singh-pti.jpg"

Standing before world leaders, the rapper expressed concern for religious freedom and thanked former President Donald Trump for “prioritizing this issue” and “calling for urgent action to defend Christians in Nigeria. ” Minaj spoke of the humanitarian side of the crisis, saying, “Protecting Christians in Nigeria is not about taking sides or dividing people, it’s about uniting humanity.”The UN trip sparked a viral moment on social media when Minaj took to X, posting, “United Nations was a MAGA Flex. Trump on da text. Yall should be afraid of what I’m gon do next.” Fans quickly noticed the reference to Jay-Z’s 2009 song “On to the Next One,” where he raps, “Obama on the text/Y’all should be afraid of what I’m gon’ do next.” Minaj put her own spin on the line, mixing her activism with a dif at her feud with Jay-Z.Minaj said she felt nervous before delivering her speech but called it “an opportunity of this magnitude” and said she was grateful to have a platform to speak. She also spoke of the need for respect across beliefs, saying, “We don’t have to share the same beliefs in order to respect each other.” Her message came in response to Ambassador Mike Waltz, who had praised her as a “principled artist willing to speak out against injustice.Outside the UN, Nicki Minaj is making headlines again over a social media showdown with Cardi B. It sparked after Minaj slammed Cardi’s latest album Am I the Drama?, calling out the $4.99 promotional price and hinting the sales were inflated. She even twisted lyrics from Cardi’s song “Magnet” into jabs about her appearance and pregnancy. In response, Cardi fired back hard on X, calling Nicki “Cocaine Barbie” and bringing up Minaj’s brother’s criminal record. This feud, which dates back years, has reignited with full force and while they are trading insults, fans continue to debate whether it’s a publicity play, a genuine beef, or both.Recently, Nicki Minaj also pulled Cardi B’s partner and baby daddy, NFL star Stefon Diggs , into the spotlight. In posts on X, Minaj wrote, “f**king a DL man raw & got pregnant wit another monkey. You said oh well, he all our baby daddies now…” She added, “Your husband said he NEVER LIKED YOU. Your pssy on YUCK. HUBBY told PEE YEARS ago how UGLY you look always swollen & botched in the face from surgery.” While Diggs has stayed silent and not reacted publicly, his high-profile relationship with Cardi B, whom he recently welcomed a son with, has made him an unexpected figure in the drama.","Nicki Minaj made headlines this week with a high-profile visit to the United Nations.

Usha Vance Breaks the Internet: Awkward Body Language & Bare Finger Raise Eyebrows





Second Lady Usha Vance addressed speculation about her marriage to US Vice President JD Vance after she was photographed without her wedding ring during an official visit to Camp Lejeune with First Lady Melania Trump on November 19.A spokesperson for Usha Vance told People magazine that she is “a mother of three young children, who does a lot of dishes, gives lots of baths, and forgets her ring sometimes,” offering a straightforward explanation for the missing ring.As the discussion continued online, zoomed-in images of her hand circulated. The spokesperson said that there was no deeper meaning behind the moment and noted that Usha often removes her ring while looking after her children and completing daily chores. Usha, 39, and JD Vance, 41, have been married since 2014 and have three children—Ewan, 8; Vivek, 5; and Mirabel, 3.The latest rumours followed a separate viral moment in late October involving JD Vance and Erika Kirk, widow of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, at a Turning Point USA event. Kirk, who now leads the organisation, delivered an emotional introduction, saying she saw “similarities” between her late husband and the vice president.Their subsequent hug drew scrutiny online, with viewers dissecting their hand placements and questioning whether the embrace was appropriate given the context of recent grief. Kirk has previously described both JD and Usha Vance as “incredible people” who provided meaningful support after her husband’s death.JD Vance also received criticism for saying he ""hopes"" his Hindu-born wife might “eventually” feel drawn to Catholicism, while adding that the decision would be her own.","Usha Vance was photographed without her wedding ring during an official visit to Camp Lejeune with First Lady Melania Trump on November 19.

Chauncey Billups’ not guilty plea deepens mysterious scandal linking NBA figures to alleged mafia-rigged poker games

In a broad criminal case, Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups entered a not guilty plea in Brooklyn federal court on Monday. The NBA Hall of Famer was charged in the case with working with the mafia to rig illegal poker games. During a hearing for all 31 defendants in the case, the arraignment took place.Prosecutors claim that they planned a complex conspiracy to use the celebrity status of professional athletes to entice victims to play card games and then deceive them using sophisticated gear. Billups is accused of money laundering and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The 49-year-old was freed on a $5 million bond backed by his Colorado residence.The Portland Trail Blazers coach and basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges that he profited from rigged poker games involving many Mafia leaders and at least one other former NBA player.Before U.S. District Judge Ramon Reyes, Billups' attorney Marc Mukasey entered the plea on his behalf. Billups is accused of conspiring to commit fraud and money laundering. He has denied any misconduct through his attorneys.His attorney when he was indicted in October, Chris Heywood, characterized him as a ""man of integrity"" and denied the allegations. Heywood stated that the indictment was first made public by prosecutors following Billups' appearance in federal court in Portland, Oregon:""To believe that Chauncey Billups did what the federal government is accusing him of is to believe that he would risk his Hall of Fame legacy, his reputation and his freedom. He would not jeopardize those things for anything, let alone a card game.”In light of the current increase in legal sports betting in the US, the matter pertains to a criminal investigation into claims of bet-rigging by professional athletes. Along with a similar investigation that accused Jones and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier of using insider information to rig NBA games between 2022 and 2024, the allegations against Billups were made public in October.The judge released Billups on a $5 million bond during a bond hearing later on Monday morning. As they left the courtroom, he and lawyer Marc Mukasey declined to comment. Prosecutors in the poker case claim that Billups and other professional athletes tricked victims into playing against cheats who utilized modified shuffle machines and X-ray card tables to figure out the cards in the victims' hands.Prosecutors claim that participants of the conspiracy utilized violence and extortion to collect on debts acquired by victims, and that the alleged scam began in 2019 and robbed victims of at least $7 million.Along with suspected members of the La Cosa Nostra organized crime groups in New York, former Cleveland Cavaliers guard Damon Jones was also indicted in the investigation. Each of them has entered a not guilty plea. The next hearing is scheduled for 2 p.m. ET on March 4. Meanwhile, as of now, Billups hasn’t said anything.Also read: Fact Check: Have the Portland Trail Blazers fired Chauncey Billups?

From chainsaws to silence: DOGE's brief tenure



DOGE staff scattered across government as agency dissolves







The Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting initiative led by billionaire Elon Musk that dominated the early months of President Donald Trump's second term, has been shut down with eight months remaining on its charter, according to Reuters, in what appears to be the administration's ultimate cost-saving measure.""That doesn't exist,"" Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor told Reuters when asked about DOGE's status, confirming it is no longer a ""centralised entity."" The OPM has since absorbed many of DOGE's functions, marking the end of an agency that promised sweeping government reform but delivered questionable results.Created in January through executive order, DOGE was expected to operate through July 2026. The agency made dramatic efforts to shrink federal agencies, cut budgets, and redirect work to Trump priorities in its early months. Elon Musk, who initially led the department, regularly promoted its work on social media and famously brandished a chainsaw at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, declaring it ""the chainsaw for bureaucracy. ""DOGE claimed to have slashed tens of billions of dollars in expenditures, but outside financial experts found it impossible to verify these claims because the unit never provided detailed public accounting.The agency's website still claims approximately $214 billion in savings, though a Politico review found the numbers were inflated by counting maximum possible contract values rather than actual spending reductions.The shut down follows Musk's public feud with Trump in May, after which Musk left Washington and exited DOGE. Musk's ""right-hand man,"" Steve Davis , also departed shortly after his boss's exit.By May, more than 200,000 federal workers had been laid off and roughly 75,000 had accepted buyouts.Former DOGE employees have moved to new positions throughout the administration. Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia now heads Trump's National Design Studio, tasked with beautifying government websites. So far, his design studio has launched websites to recruit law enforcement officers to patrol Washington, D.C., and advertise the president's drug pricing program.Edward Coristine, a DOGE employee nicknamed ""Big Balls,"" has also joined Gebbia's National Design Studio effort, encouraging his followers on X to apply to the new body.Acting DOGE Administrator Amy Gleason formally became an adviser to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in March, according to court filings, with her public statements largely focused on her HHS role. Zachary Terrell, part of the DOGE team given access to government health systems early in Trump's second term, is now chief technology officer at the Department of Health and Human Services, while Rachel Riley, who had similar access, now serves as chief of the Office of Naval Research.Jeremy Lewin, who helped Musk dismantle the US Agency for International Development, now oversees foreign assistance at the State Department. Scott Langmack, DOGE's representative at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has been tasked by the White House budget office with creating custom AI applications to analyze US regulations and determine which ones to eliminate, according to his LinkedIn profile.The government-wide hiring freeze, another hallmark of DOGE, has also ended, with Kupor stating there is no longer a target for workforce reductions.Spokeswoman Liz Huston told Reuters only that Trump ""continues to actively deliver"" on reducing waste and fraud. Trump himself has begun referring to DOGE in the past tense in recent statements to reporters, subtly signaling its demise without formal acknowledgment.","Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, has been shut down with eight months remaining on its charter.

RAIPUR: A case of corporal punishment has emerged from Surajpur in Chhattisgarh, where a four-year-old LKG student was tied with a rope and hung from a tree on Monday.The incident took place in Narayanpur village when two women teachers at a private school allegedly punished the child for not completing his homework.The case came to light after a video went viral on social media, triggering outrage and prompting the education department to launch an urgent inquiry.According to the viral video, teachers Kajal Sahu and Anuradha Dewangan tied a rope to the child’s shirt and hung him from a tree inside the school premises. A young man standing on a nearby rooftop recorded the incident on his phone and later uploaded it online, following which the authorities were informed.The video also shows that instead of stopping the punishment, the teachers tried to prevent the recording.Local residents, angered by the brutality, circulated the video widely, demanding immediate and strict action.Sankul-in-charge Manoj Yadav visited the school for an on-the-spot inspection. The probe officer admitted that the teachers’ actions were “completely wrong” and said a detailed report had been submitted to senior district officials, who will decide the next course of action.Although the child is safe, parents have raised concerns about the treatment their children receive at school. “It could have been life-threatening,” said the parents.Santosh Sahu, a relative of the child, confirmed the incident and said the family is preparing to lodge a formal complaint. “If a child is punished like this for homework, what else can happen in this school?” he said.The education department has yet to issue a statement on the incident.","A four-year-old LKG student was tied with a rope and hung from a tree on Monday.

Trump Gives Major Mamdani Vibes With New Winter-Fit & Americans Have A Lot To Say About It

LIVE: Trump and Mamdani meeting at the White House (FULL)





New York governor Kathy Hochul on Monday said her advice helped Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani navigate his first high-stakes meeting with president Donald Trump , a meeting that ended on a surprisingly friendly note and eased fears of federal intervention in New York City.Hochul said she spoke to Mamdani before he visited the White House on Friday. She told him he needed to show Trump that he had firm control over the city and could be trusted to handle safety and governance without outside pressure. According to her, it was important to give the president “confidence” so he would not send the National Guard into the city.“He has already hit the ground running,” Hochul said at a press event in the Bronx, reported New York Post. “And I have the confidence in him that I wanted the president to have as well: that we don’t need any interventions,” she added,The meeting produced an unusual scene in the Oval Office. Trump openly praised Mamdani, a Democratic socialist who has publicly called him a “fascist”.The president also stepped back from his threat to deploy the National Guard after Mamdani assured him that crime control would remain a priority. He also told Trump he planned to keep NYPD commissioner Jessica Tisch in place.“I expect to be helping him, not hurting him, a big help because I want New York City to be great,” Trump said.Hochul also said she encouraged Mamdani to look for areas where he could work with Trump.She pointed to her own talks with the president, which she said helped push forward the long-delayed Penn Station redevelopment.However, Hochul stopped short of saying that Trump would drop his threat to cut federal funding for the city. She noted only that the outcome of Friday’s meeting had reduced tension.“I believe we are in a better place this Monday than we were Friday going into that meeting,” she said. “The president had a chance to see someone, as I have, who has the capacity and the vision that the city needs at this time.”Hochul added that Mamdani called her the day after his White House visit to thank her for the guidance.“I told him I thought he did everything he needed to do to make sure the president has confidence in his leadership,” she said.","New York governor Kathy Hochul said her advice helped Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani navigate his first high-stakes meeting with president Donald Trump.

Emergency crews assess damage

Tornado watch continues





More than 100 homes were damaged on Monday afternoon after a tornado hit Harris County, Texas authorities said.Officials said there were no serious injuries or deaths. Brian Murray from the county’s office of homeland security and emergency Management said teams earlier moved through the debris to check if anyone was trapped or hurt, CNN reported.The National Weather Service has confirmed a tornado struck the area but has not yet rated its intensity.The storm formed as warm air met a cold front in the Houston region, creating unstable conditions and strong winds that led to supercell thunderstorms and several tornado reports.Drone footage showed torn-off rooftops and debris scattered across yards and pools.Photos posted by the Cy-Fair fire department showed shattered windows, damaged fences and broken structures across the area.County officials urged residents to avoid travelling because of downed power lines and widespread debris. “Our priority is the safety of our residents,” Herman said. “We are using every resource to find the injured, secure the area and support our community.”Herman called it a “severe weather event” that caused “widespread and significant damage.”The Harris County emergency services campus was also hit. A maintenance building lost its roof and back wall, according to spokesperson Miranda Sevcik.Two workers inside took cover and escaped without injury.Sevcik said large trees “snapped like toothpicks.” She was in another building during the tornado and described hearing shutters fall, feeling a sudden pressure drop, and then a brief silence before the storm moved on.“What sounded like hail turned out to just be the shutters dropping, and then all of a sudden, you could feel the pressure drop, and then it just got really, really quiet,” Sevcik described. “It went by very, very fast. And then we opened the doors, thankfully …and we saw the damage. We’re like, ‘oh, my gosh,’ just like matchsticks.”A tornado watch is in place until 1 am CT for much of eastern Texas, including Houston. The watch also covers parts of western and central Louisiana.","More than 100 homes damaged in Harris County, Texas. No serious injuries or deaths reported.

A coordinated attack involving suicide bombers and gunmen targeted the headquarters of the Federal Constabulary (FC) paramilitary force in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Peshawar on Monday. Rebel group Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA) has claimed responsibility for the attack. While the group claimed around two dozen casualties and death of three of its fighters, Pakistani authorities said there were six deaths, including that of three soldiers.The JuA, which is comprised of soldiers from Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), was also behind the suicide bombing at a judicial complex in Islamabad a day after the blast in Delhi. Monday's operation began with a suicide bomber detonating explosives at the main entrance of the highly secured FC headquarters, a compound located in a densely populated area on Sunehri Masjid Road in Peshawar Cantonment.Following the initial blast, at least two other attackers breached the premises and engaged security forces, sources said. Several personnel and civilians were also reported injured and rushed to nearby hospitals.Over two dozen people were admitted for treatment.Peshawar capital city police officer Mian Saeed Ahmad told local media that the three personnel killed were stationed at the main gate. Ahmad claimed that the quick response of security forces resulted in the timely elimination of the remaining two attackers, preventing a potentially high casualty count as a large number of personnel were reportedly gathered inside for parade drills.A representative of JuA posted on Telegram about the attack, saying: ""Three suicide mujahideen are participating in the attack. We want the complete and 100% implementation of Sharia. If the enemy agrees to 99% but refuses even 1%, then our jihad against them will continue. Insha'Allah...""The JuA split from TTP in 2014 due to ideological differences. However, it joined hands with TTP again a few years ago.

Laura Loomer and Marjorie Taylor Greene drama gets louder on X





A big rumor spread fast on X when an account called @DissidentWire posted that Laura Loomer was pregnant with Ian Miles Cheong’s child. The post got millions of views very quickly, and many people started talking about it. But the truth came out just as fast. Laura Loomer saw the rumor and said it was completely fake. She wrote on X, “Stop lying. One, I’m not pregnant.” She also joked about her body to show how silly the rumor was.The account that started the claim has a parody label in its bio. It makes joke posts about many famous people, so the rumor was not real from the start. Also, no big news site or trusted source has said anything about Laura Loomer being pregnant. There is no proof anywhere that she is having Ian Miles Cheong’s baby. The whole talk came from one joke post that went viral.While the fake pregnancy story was growing online, Laura Loomer was already in the news for her posts about Marjorie Taylor Greene. When Donald Trump pulled his support from Marjorie Taylor Greene and said she had become “a ranting lunatic,” Laura Loomer joked about moving to Georgia. She asked if she should go there since Trump wanted Greene to face a new challenger.Later, when Marjorie Taylor Greene said she would step down from her role in January 2026, Laura Loomer made many posts about it.

WASHINGTON: The US on Monday formally designated Cartel de los Soles a foreign terrorist organization, layering additional terrorism-related sanctions on the group it has said includes Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and other high-ranking officials.Venezuela's govt rejected what it called a ""ridiculous"" US plan to designate the ""non-existent"" group.Secretary of state Marco Rubio said this month his country would announce the designation as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) for its alleged role in importing illegal drugs into the US. Maduro faces escalating pressure from President Trump's massive US military buildup in the Caribbean, raising concerns that the US may seek to use the designation to justify military action.","Venezuela's govt rejected what it called a ""ridiculous"" US plan to designate the ""non-existent"" group.

Trump Targets Muslim Brotherhood as Terrorist Organization





US president Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order to start the process of declaring certain branches of the Muslim Brotherhood as foreign terrorist organisations. The order names chapters in Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan.According to the order, these branches “engage in or facilitate and support violence and destabilisation campaigns” that harm their regions, US citizens and US interests.“President Trump is confronting the Muslim Brotherhood’s transnational network, which fuels terrorism and destabilisation campaigns against US interests and allies in the Middle East,” the White House said.The Muslim Brotherhood is a pan-Islamist movement founded in Egypt in 1928. Its founder, Hassan al-Banna, believed that returning to Islamic principles would help the Muslim world resist Western influence.A US “terrorist” designation allows Washington to freeze any assets the group may hold in the country and block members from entering the United States.The Muslim Brotherhood is already banned in several countries, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Jordan outlawed it in April this year, accusing the group of making and storing weapons and planning to destabilise the kingdom.The group, however, remains popular in Jordan and continues to operate even after a 2020 court ruling to dissolve it.In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood has been banned since 2013, after the military removed its leader and then-president Mohamed Morsi. The coup was led by Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has remained in power since and built a close partnership with Washington.In May, French president Emmanuel Macron asked his government to draft measures to limit the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood and curb the spread of political Islam in France.","The order names chapters in Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan.

Court quashes James Comey and Letitia James cases: Trump’s interim attorney pick ruled invalid; White House to appeal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/court-quashes-comey-and-letitia-james-cases-trumps-interim-attorney-pick-ruled-invalid-white-house-to-appeal/articleshow/125552627.cms,"Letitia James and James Comey

BREAKING: James Comey, Letitia James cases dismissed





A federal judge on Monday (local time) dismissed the indictments against former FBI director James Comey and New York attorney general Letitia James. The decision came after the court ruled that president Donald Trump’s appointment of interim US attorney Lindsey Halligan in Virginia was invalid.Judge Cameron McGowan Currie, in her order, wrote that the attorney general’s attempt to install Halligan as the interim US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia “was invalid,” and that all actions taken under her “defective appointment”, including the indictments, were unlawful.Letitia James welcomed the decision, saying, “I am heartened by today’s victory and grateful for the prayers and support I have received from around the country,” she said. “I remain fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day.”Comey responded in an Instagram video, saying, “I’m grateful that the court ended the case against me, which was a prosecution based on malevolence and incompetence and a reflection of what the department of justice has become under Donald Trump, which is heartbreaking.”The White House said the justice department will appeal the ruling.Attorney general Pam Bondi repeated this at a press conference, saying the government would take “all available legal action” to hold Comey and James accountable.Currie explained that only judges of the eastern district of Virginia can appoint a temporary US attorney until the Senate confirms a nominee. Halligan, a former White House adviser, had taken over after the Trump administration pushed out her predecessor. Defence lawyers argued that the 120-day limit for interim appointments had already expired when she stepped in, making her appointment unlawful. Currie agreed, saying the government cannot bypass Senate confirmation by repeatedly installing short-term appointees.The judge also noted that accepting the government’s argument would allow officials to send “any private citizen off the street” to lead a grand jury, as long as the attorney general approved it later, something she said “cannot be the law.”Comey had been accused of passing information to reporters through his lawyer in 2017 and of giving false statements to Congress. James faced charges of making false statements to a financial institution and bank fraud, which she also denied.Trump has repeatedly demanded prosecutions of Comey, James, and other critics. In one Truth Social post, he wrote that they were “guilty as hell,” though the justice department argued these posts were opinions, not directives.",Indictments against James Comey and Letitia James dismissed.

Nikki Haley’s son, Nalin Haley has hinted that he sees Vice President JD Vance as the potential leader of the Republican Party in 2028, even as he distances himself from many of his mother’s political views.The 24-year-old Indian-origin has emerged as one of MAGA's youngest voices. Nalin's ideas are polar opposite of his mother Nikki Haley, who was Donald Trump’s last major challenger in the 2024 Republican primary.Nalin has been a strong critic of the H-1B visa system, saying all legal and illegal immigration should be stopped. He has also argued that dual citizenship is a “stupid idea” and that people living in America must speak only English. Nalin has claimed that foreign enrolment conflicts with the “America First” agenda and that immigrants are taking jobs and opportunities from native-born Americans. He also claimed that naturalised citizens should not hold public office in US.Nalin campaigned with his mother during her 2024 run, but says he did it out of family duty rather than shared politics. He told the Journal that he was simply being a “good son” and was “never going to be an advocate for a view that I did not have.”Nalin’s hardline stance on sensitive issues has stirred a row across party lines, mainly due to his own immigrant roots. Some in the MAGA base and the far right told him that he, too, is “an immigrant by blood” and should “self-deport”. Democrats and liberals accused him of hypocrisy and argued that Nikki Haley had “not taught her son well”. Despite the criticism, Nalin maintains that his loyalty is to America and America only.","The 24-year-old Indian-origin has emerged as one of MAGA's youngest voices.

What is Temporary Protected Status?





The Donald Trump administration Monday announced ending the Temporary Protected Status for Myanmar which will be effective on January 26, 2026. The situation in Myanmar has improved enough that Burmese nationals can now go home, Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem said.“This decision restores TPS to its original status as temporary,” said Secretary Kristi Noem. “The situation in Burma has improved enough that it is safe for Burmese citizens to return home, so we are terminating the Temporary Protected Status. Burma has made notable progress in governance and stability, including the end of its state of emergency, plans for free and fair elections, successful ceasefire agreements, and improved local governance contributing to enhanced public service delivery and national reconciliation,"" Noem said, adding that given the improvement in the situation in Myanmar permitting Burmese nationals to remain temporarily in the US is contrary to the national interest of the US.The Department of Homeland Security estimates there are nearly 4,000 people from Myanmar currently living in the United States under the TPS designation.It is an immigration status in the US which is given to people who are from countries that are experiencing war or armed conflict, natural disasters or any other unsafe conditions. If the US government designates a country for TPS, people from that country who are already in the US can apply to stay legally for a set period.They can also legally work in the US.The TPS status for Myanmar had been extended for 18 months from May 26, 2024, until Nov. 25 under the administration of Trump's Democratic predecessor Joe Biden.At least 60 days before a TPS designation expires, the secretary, after consultation with appropriate US government agencies, is required to review the conditions in a country designated for TPS to determine whether the conditions supporting the designation continue to be met, and, if so, how long to extend the designation, the DHS note said explaining the process of how the status is reviewed.""If the secretary determines that the conditions in the foreign state continue to meet the specific statutory criteria for Temporary Protected Status designation, Temporary Protected Status will be extended for an additional period of 6 months or, in the Secretary’s discretion, 12 or 18 months. If the Secretary determines that the foreign state no longer meets the conditions for Temporary Protected Status designation, the Secretary must terminate the designation,"" it said.","The situation in Myanmar has improved enough that Burmese nationals can now go home.

Suicide Bombers Storm Pakistan’s FC Headquarters In Peshawar As Explosions Rock High-Security Zone

How it unfolded



Rise in militant attacks







Pakistan’s northwestern city of Peshawar witnessed a major security breach on Monday morning when suicide bombers targeted the headquarters of the Federal Constabulary (FC), a paramilitary force stationed in a densely populated area near the military cantonment. The assault left at least three FC personnel dead and several others injured, prompting a large-scale operation to clear the compound and secure the neighbourhood.Police and rescue officials confirmed that the attackers struck just after 8am, hitting the main entrance before attempting to push further inside. According to senior officers, the security response prevented a mass-casualty event, especially as dozens of FC personnel were gathered on the parade ground at the time.Officials said the assault began when one suicide bomber blew himself up at the main gate. “The first suicide bomber first carried out an attack on the main entrance of the constabulary and the other one entered the compound,” a senior official told Reuters.Police Chief Saeed Ahmad said one attacker detonated his explosives at the main gate, while the second bomber was shot dead near the parking area. He confirmed that several terrorists were on foot and attempting to reach the parade ground.“The terrorists involved in today's attack were on foot and failed to reach the parade area and a timely response by our forces prevented a much larger tragedy,” he told AP.Other security officials reported that three militants in total attempted to storm the complex. “One attacker detonated himself at the main gate of the FC Headquarters, while two others managed to enter the premises,” CCPO Dr Mian Saeed said, adding that both were killed in the ensuing gun battle. The FC immediately cordoned off the area, diverted traffic and launched a sweeping search operation.Hospital officials confirmed that at least five people, including FC personnel and civilians, were injured. Emergency measures were declared at Lady Reading Hospital and Khyber Teaching Hospital, where all the wounded were reported to be in stable condition.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the assault, saying “Timely action taken by security forces saved us from major harm,” while President Asif Ali Zardari warned that “externally backed Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken Pakistan’s unity, resilience or resolve”.No group claimed responsibility, but the incident comes amid a sharp rise in militant attacks since the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) ended a ceasefire in 2022. Islamabad has repeatedly accused the TTP of operating from Afghan soil—an allegation Kabul denies.Monday’s bombing marks the second major attack on a security installation in Peshawar in recent years, following the 2023 Police Lines mosque blast that killed 84 people. Security forces have since intensified operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, where attacks on military and police units have surged.",Suicide bombers targeted the headquarters of the Federal Constabulary (FC) in Peshawar.

On September 3, a suicide attack at a political rally in Quetta killed 11 people and injured more than 40, striking a stadium parking area where hundreds of Balochistan National Party supporters had assembled.Pakistani forces have been battling a longstanding insurgency in Balochistan, which has claimed 782 lives in 2024. In March, the Baloch Liberation Army hijacked a train and killed off-duty troops. Since January, over 430 people—mostly security personnel—have been killed in various attacks, including six soldiers in Bannu.","Two suicide bombers strike Pakistan's paramilitary force headquarters in Peshawar.
