DHARAMSHALA: A day before his 90th birthday and amid talks of succession, Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama Saturday said he hoped to live beyond 130 years.Addressing devotees during a long-life prayer ceremony held by Central Tibetan Administration at main Tibetan temple in McLeodganj, he said, ""So far, I believe I have served Buddha Dharma and the Tibetan people quite well. .. I hope to live for another 30 or 40 years - even over 130.""The Tibetan spiritual master - known for his scientific temperament - has often laughed off in his trademark humour any talk about his years on Earth, each time giving different figures.In Dec 2024, he had said he might live for 110 years or more. Five years before that, he assured his followers he would live beyond 113 years.CTA president Penpa Tsering told TOI, ""It is very difficult to interpret what His Holiness says... We believe every word he speaks.""Speaking to a gathering that included Union minister Kiren Rijiju, Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu, and MP Tapir Gao, the Dalai Lama said, “So today, here we have gods, representatives of gods, and human beings gathering the auspicious conditions for my long life and offering your prayers sincerely.”He also talked about meeting Mao Zedong, who dismissed religion as “poison,” and India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. He called upon the audience to maintain faith and generate the altruistic mind of ‘Bodhichitta’ — the essence of Dharma to fulfil the welfare of self and others. “I trust in the blessings of Avalokiteshvara.

"All eyes on India as Brics takes up US tariffs, Israel",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/all-eyes-on-india-as-brics-takes-up-us-tariffs-israel/articleshow/122272731.cms,"NEW DELHI: While the Brics Declaration that will follow the two-day summit beginning Sunday is expected to factor in India's concerns on terrorism, it may also call upon India to take a stronger position on issues like US President Donald Trump's unilateral tariffs and Israel's actions in Gaza.Brics countries were engaged in intense negotiations to finalise the declaration as PM Narendra Modi arrived in Rio for the summit on Sunday. A draft statement under discussion proposed condemnation of US tariffs and some of Israel's actions in Gaza, issues on which India has nuanced its position given its efforts to reach a trade deal with the US before Jan 9, Trump's deadline for suspension of tariffs, and its balancing act on relations with Israel and Palestine.Brics - which was expanded last year to include Egypt, Ethiopia, UAE, Indonesia, Iran and Saudi Arabia as full members - has been an important platform for India to focus on issues like multilateral reforms, counterterrorism, sustainable development goals and people-to-people exchanges. Modi is expected to strongly raise the issue of cross-border terrorism in his address to further sensitise the international community about the role of Pakistan in promoting terrorism, as evident from the recent Pahalgam attack.The Brics Declaration will be followed closely for what it has to say on tariffs and the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. According to a Bloomberg report from Rio, going by a draft statement under discussion, Brics heads of govt are likely to adopt a position at odds with the Trump administration on tariffs and aspects of the conflict in the Middle East. The statement, however, doesn't name the Trump administration or the US on the tariff issue as not all countries apparently were comfortable with it.There's also a proposal for the leaders to express serious concern about the situation in Palestinian territory, citing the resumption of Israeli attacks and the obstruction of the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The language, according to the report, includes a condemnation of the use of starvation as a method of warfare - a reference to charges levelled at Israel.While it's not clear how much of the draft statement will appear in the final text that will be adopted on July 7, a proposal for full withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip is also being deliberated. This may be a little off-putting for India which abstained from a UNGA vote recently for immediate ceasefire in Gaza.However, while India recently backed out of a statement by the SCO condemning Israel's attacks on Iran, it has been more flexible with Brics.",Brics countries were engaged in intense negotiations to finalise the declaration as PM Narendra Modi arrived in Rio for the summit on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: The three men accused of gangraping a student inside South Calcutta Law College on June 25 spent several hours drinking in the institute’s guard room after committing the crime, police said on Saturday.The prime accused, Monojit Mishra, along with Pramit Mukherjee and Zaib Ahmed, even warned the college’s security guard to stay silent before heading out for dinner.“After committing the crime, the three consumed alcohol in the guard's room and then asked security guard Pinaki Banerjee to keep his mouth shut about the incident,” an investigating officer was quoted as saying to news agency PTI.The trio later went to a dhaba along EM Bypass for dinner before returning to their respective homes the next morning, police said.Investigators believe the gangrape was not a spontaneous act but a planned assault. According to the officer, Call Detail Records (CDRs) revealed multiple conversations among the accused in the days leading up to the incident.The investigation further revealed that Monojit tried to seek help the next day. On June 26, he contacted an “influential” person in Deshapriya Park, someone who had reportedly helped him in the past.However, that individual refused to assist this time, sensing the gravity of the situation, the officer added.After being turned down, Monojit reportedly tried reaching out to several of his so-called “mentors” in different areas of the city. “Monojit went to various parts of the city including Rashbehari, Deshapriya Park, Gariahat, Fern Road, and Ballygunge Station Road, trying to meet his mentors. Mobile tower data also indicated that he visited someone near Karaya police station,” the officer said.Police say Monojit's movements after the crime suggest he was trying to get help to run away or hide the case.Security guard Pinaki Banerjee has also been arrested, and the college has come under scrutiny for lapses in safety and oversight. The case is being probed by a Special Investigation Team formed by Kolkata Police.The incident sparked protests and outrage across the city.","The three men accused of gangraping a student inside South Calcutta Law College on June 25 spent several hours drinking in the institute’s guard room after committing the crime, police said.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai investor Sushil Kedia’s office in Worli was vandalised on Saturday morning by unidentified individuals allegedly linked to the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), days after he publicly challenged party chief Raj Thackeray and declared he would not learn Marathi. The attackers raised slogans in support of Thackeray and hurled stones at the office. Police have detained five MNS supporters in connection with the incident and said security had already been deployed at the site following earlier threats to Kedia.What do we know so far-Sushil Kedia, a long-time resident of Mumbai and founder of an investment service firm, had posted a provocative message on social media platform X on July 3. In it, he declared: “I don’t know Marathi properly even after living for 30 years in Mumbai & with your gross misconduct I have made it a resolve that until such people as you are allowed to pretend to be taking care of Marathi Manus I take pratigya I won’t learn Marathi. Kya karna hai bol?”The post drew a sharp response from MNS leader Sandeep Deshpande, who posted on X: “Do business if you're a businessman; don't try to act like our father.If you insult Marathi in Maharashtra, you'll get a slap on the ear, otherwise, stay in your lane, Mehta or whoever. That's all for now.”According to police, a group of unidentified men showed up at Kedia’s office near Century Bazar in Worli on Saturday morning and began vandalising the premises. They shouted pro-Marathi slogans and praised Raj Thackeray. Stones were thrown at the office, though no injuries were reported. Five MNS supporters were later detained.Hours after the attack, Kedia posted a video on X apologising to Raj Thackeray. The caption read: “I request Raj Thackeray Ji to consider my humble submission.”Earlier in the week, Kedia had approached police after receiving threats online. He tagged the Mumbai Police and other authorities, writing: “Shri @RajThackeray threatening me by 100s of your workers is not going to make me a fluent Marathi speaker... With so much threatening around even more fear happens that if I miss speaking any word(s) improperly more violence will happen.”“Please note @CPMumbaiPolice @Dev_Fadnavis open threats of violence are being issued by @RajThackeray workers. Provide me safety. Is an Indian having any rights to dignity & safety in Maharashtra today is a question even our @HMOIndia @AmitShah ji might ponder on as well.”The episode comes on the heels of another controversy involving MNS. In Mira Road, a sweet shop owner was recently beaten by seven MNS workers for not speaking Marathi. The incident, caught on camera, led to widespread protests in the area, with many shopkeepers shutting their establishments in solidarity. The MNS workers were detained but later released after being served police notices.

NEW DELHI: Delhi HC dismissed 300 petitions filed by defence ministry challenging Armed Forces Tribunal's order that had granted disability pensions to soldiers even when they were not posted on front lines, observing that disability pensions to armed forces personnel acknowledge their sacrifice to the nation.""It is not an act of generosity, but a rightful and just acknowledgment of the sacrifices endured by them, which manifest in the form of disabilities or disorders suffered during the course of their military service. It is a measure that upholds the State's responsibility towards its soldiers,"" said the division bench comprising Justices Navin Chawla and Shalinder Kaur.Govt had approached court, arguing that medical conditions of soldiers involved in these cases were neither attributable to nor aggravated by military service and, therefore, they were not entitled to disability element of the pension.Attorney general R Venkataramani, on Centre's behalf, contended that the presumption - where a member of the armed forces is deemed to have been in sound physical and mental health upon entering service unless a disability was noted at the time of enlistment - no longer applies.However, the court observed that disability pension cannot be denied solely on grounds that onset of the disability occurred while the soldier was posted at a peace station.""Undisputably, even when not on the front lines or in hard areas, soldiers are aware that the threat is never far away. This environment, where danger is a constant reality for their peers and could become their own at any moment, creates a persistent state of mental and emotional strain that cannot be overlooked,"" the court said.","Delhi HC dismissed 300 petitions filed by defence ministry challenging Armed Forces Tribunal's order that had granted disability pensions to soldiers.

The pilgrims in the buses were part of a larger group of 6,979 who had left for the cave shrine in Kashmir from a base camp in Jammu.The mishap prompted a directive from J&K lieutenant-governor Manoj Sinha for comprehensive safety measures in vehicles ferrying Amarnath pilgrims. He asked officials to ensure checks at all key locations and guarantee uninterrupted availability of food and medicines along the yatra route. “By the blessings of Lord Shiva, all devotees are safe. Our priority is the safety of all pilgrims,” a govt spokesman said.The 36 injured were treated at Ramban District Hospital and discharged. Most carried on with their journey. The bus whose driver lost control was damaged and its pilgrims were shifted to another vehicle, Ramban SSP Kulbir Singh said, adding only three to four of the injured changed their mind and decided not to go further.“Most of the injuries were minor and all affected yatris were discharged after first aid,” said Ramban deputy commissioner Ilyas Khan, who had rushed with other senior officials to the spot in Chanderkote. LG Sinha spoke to Khan to provide all necessary assistance to the injured pilgrims.According to SSP Singh, the private bus that lost control was from Madhya Pradesh. “The yatra convoy had halted for breakfast at Chanderkote Langer (a community kitchen that provides free food to devotees),” SSP Singh said.Earlier in the morning, the 6,979 pilgrims had left the base camp in Jammu braving heavy rain, officials said.

SRINAGAR: J&K high court recently acquitted a man sentenced to life imprisonment for allegedly murdering his wife in 2012, citing major flaws in the investigation and granting him benefit of the doubt.The division bench overturned the 2015 conviction by principal sessions judge of Udhampur, ruling that the prosecution’s case was riddled with inconsistencies, unreliable evidence, and procedural lapses.Maan Chand, a resident of Ramnagar in Jammu, had been convicted under section 302 of the now-repealed Ranbir Penal Code for the murder of his wife Kanta Devi on the intervening night of Oct 26–27 in 2012. Prosecutors claimed he attacked her with a bamboo stick and sickle after objecting to an alleged extra-marital relationship, and then set her and the bedding on fire using kerosene from a lamp.The bench questioned the credibility of the evidence presented. “There were inconsistencies regarding the type of weapons used, the nature of injuries, and contradictions in recovery of the alleged weapon of offence,” the high court said.Autopsy procedures were also called into question. It was conducted in a private residence, with conflicting reasons offered by the doctor, witnesses, and investigating officer.The doctor wasn’t shown the alleged murder weapon and issued the autopsy report 22 days after examination. The bench said he failed to explain how he remembered specific wound details after such a delay.The court flagged inconsistencies in the timeline of Chand’s arrest and discrepancies in witness and police accounts of visits to the crime scene. It also said that no evidence was submitted to support the claim of Kanta Devi’s alleged infidelity — mainstay of the prosecution’s motive narrative.A crucial aspect overlooked by the trial court, the bench said, was the presence of the couple’s 2.5-year-old son, who allegedly suffered burns on his back. “No attempt was made to consider why, if the accused was present during the crime, he didn’t rescue his son,” the judges wrote.Quoting Aristotle, the bench remarked: “A father would instinctively risk his life to save his child.” He criticised the trial court for failing to weigh this natural paternal instinct.The bench allowed the appeal, set aside the lower court’s judgment and acquitted Chand of all charges. “He shall be set at liberty forthwith, if not required in any other case,” the order said.","Maan Chand, a resident of Ramnagar in Jammu, had been convicted under section 302 of the now-repealed Ranbir Penal Code for the murder of his wife Kanta Devi.

'Do Aamir Khan, Javed Akhtar Speak in Marathi?' Maha Minister's Reaction on Language Row Goes Viral

Poll Will the unity of Shiv Sena (UBT) and MNS influence the upcoming local body elections? Yes, definitely. No, it won't matter.

NEW DELHI: For the first time in 20 years, Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) president Raj Thackeray will share the stage on Saturday. The two leaders will address a joint ""victory"" rally organised by their parties to mark the withdrawal of government resolutions (GRs) related to the three-language policy.The rally is being held at the NSCI Dome in central Mumbai's Worli, which falls in the assembly constituency of Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray. The gathering is also seen as significant ahead of the upcoming local body elections, including the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls.Uddhav and Raj Thackeray, whose parties have been vocal on the issues of Marathi language and identity, last shared a stage in 2005 during the Malvan assembly bypoll campaign. That was after former chief minister Narayan Rane had left the undivided Shiv Sena. Raj Thackeray quit the party later that year and launched the MNS in 2006.The rally comes in the backdrop of protests against the April 16 GR issued by the BJP-led Mahayuti government in Maharashtra, which made Hindi a compulsory third language for students from Classes 1 to 5 in English and Marathi medium schools. Following backlash, the government amended the GR on June 17, making Hindi optional.On June 29, the cabinet decided to withdraw both GRs entirely.On the same day, leaders from Shiv Sena (UBT) and MNS had burnt copies of the GRs and had planned a protest march for July 5. After the rollback, both parties decided to hold a joint ""victory"" event instead. Uddhav and Raj had then said the government blinked after witnessing the unity of Maharashtrians and did not want them to come together.Though the two parties have chosen not to display any party flags, symbols, hoardings or scarves during the event, the political significance of the rally is being seen in the backdrop of their recent electoral performance. In the 2024 Maharashtra assembly elections, the Shiv Sena (UBT) won 20 seats while the MNS failed to win any.The parties have invited other political groups that opposed the GRs, as well as members of the literary and art community, to take part in the rally.The Congress, a partner in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance with Shiv Sena (UBT), has however said it will not attend the event. State Congress president Harshwardhan Sapkal said the party supports the stand against making Hindi mandatory but will not join the rally.NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) president Sharad Pawar also said in Pune on Thursday that he would not be attending due to prior commitments. However, NCP (SP) state president Jayant Patil said the party would be represented either by working president Supriya Sule or MLA Jitendra Awhad. Patil said MNS leader Bala Nandgaonkar had personally invited the NCP (SP).The rally takes place amid recent incidents involving both parties. MNS activists were seen on camera assaulting a food stall owner for not speaking Marathi. In another case, two people were made to apologise to a man in front of Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Rajan Vichare for allegedly attacking him. “Speak in Marathi since you have hit a Marathi person,” a voice is heard telling one of the two men while he tries to say something to Vichare, a former MP from Thane.","Uddhav and Raj Thackeray last shared a stage in 2005 during the Malvan assembly bypoll campaign.

In the Senate, a 50-50 tie was broken by Vice-President JD Vance, allowing the bill to pass just hours before Donald Trump signed it into law.The razor-thin margins in both chambers highlight how just a handful of seats could swing critical legislative outcomes, an opening Elon Musk appears to be targeting with his newly announced party.On Friday, as the US marked its 249th Independence Day, Elon Musk posted a poll on X asking followers whether he should move forward with his earlier proposal to launch the America Party as an alternative to both Republicans and Democrats. By Saturday morning, over 1.25 million users had responded, with more than 65% voting in favor of the idea.“Independence Day is the perfect time to ask if you want independence from the two-party (some would say uniparty) system!,” Musk added in the post.","Elon Musk announced on Saturday that the ""America Party"" has been established.

Dominik Hašek calls Trump “the weakest president” and Putin “a criminal” after Kyiv drone attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/dominik-haek-calls-trump-the-weakest-president-and-putin-a-criminal-after-kyiv-drone-attack/articleshow/122257068.cms,"NHL legend Dominik Hašek says Trump enabled Putin’s attack on Ukraine. (Getty Images)

Dominik Hašek didn’t hold back: “Trump is doing everything he can to help Putin”



“The weakest president! @realDonaldTrump chatted with the biggest criminal of the 21st century, Putin, and he immediately sent more than 500 drones and ballistic missiles to the Ukrainian capital, Kiev… Trump is doing everything he can to help Putin in his imperialist goals… Despicable.”

This isn’t Hašek’s first rodeo when it comes to Putin and politics



He says Trump’s call emboldened Putin and now kids are suffering



“Trump has proven more than once that he is indifferent to the Ukrainian people,”

“Despicable.”

Things got darker: Russian officials reportedly threatened Hašek for speaking up



You don’t usually expect brutal political takedowns to come from NHL legends, but Dominik Hašek just changed the game. The Hall of Fame goalie, once known for stopping slapshots, is now stopping short of calling Trump a war enabler. After Donald Trump reportedly chatted with Vladimir Putin , Russia launched over 500 drones and missiles into Ukraine’s capital, injuring dozens. Hašek’s response? A firestorm tweet calling Trump “the weakest president” and accusing him of helping Putin’s “imperialist goals.” Yeah. This wasn’t just shade, it was a direct hit.The timing was too perfect and too horrifying. Just hours after Trump’s phone call with Putin, Russian forces unleashed a terrifying assault on Kyiv. Buildings exploded. Children were hurt. Civilians ran for cover. And Dominik Hašek didn’t stay quiet.Hašek has been one of the most vocal global athletes speaking out against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine since 2022.He’s labeled the war “imperialist,” demanded bans for Russian athletes who stay silent, and directly criticized international sports organizations for giving Putin a platform.He even called out the NHL for “cowardice” over its continued inclusion of Russian players, saying silence equals support.The latest drone strike wasn’t just any attack, it was one of the largest assaults on Kyiv in months. According to Ukrainian authorities, 539 drones and 11 ballistic missiles were launched, causing massive destruction and multiple injuries, including children.For Hašek, that kind of horror isn’t accidental, it’s the consequence of weak leadership.Hašek wrote.Earlier this year, Hašek revealed that Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president had allegedly sent him death threats in response to his activism. In one chilling message, Medvedev reportedly hinted that Hašek should take his own life. The Czech government took it seriously. Prime Minister Petr Fiala publicly backed Hašek, condemning the threats and offering him protection. But instead of backing down, Hašek went louder, filing formal complaints and urging the IOC and NHL to stop giving Russia a global stage.This isn’t just a former athlete popping off on social media. Hašek is leading a charge demanding accountability from sports leagues, politicians, and fans. He’s not trying to win popularity points. He’s calling Trump “despicable.” He’s calling Putin “the biggest criminal of the 21st century.” And he’s pushing the sports world to wake up and pick a side.Also read - Carolina Hurricanes fans react to Brent Burns’ retirement with emotional tributes","NHL legend Dominik Hašek has been one of the most vocal global athletes speaking out against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine since 2022.

The trauma of being duped: Digital arrest victims troop into counsellors' chambers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/the-trauma-of-being-duped-digital-arrest-victims-troop-into-counsellors-chambers/articleshow/122275853.cms,"Representative Image





KOLKATA: An increasing number of Kolkatans are seeking out professional mental health support over ways to deal with the fallout of digital arrest. This includes both people who have been digitally defrauded, as also those who feel they are especially at risk, typically - but not restricted to - older individuals, who are not very technologically adept.The most common psychological issues being reported are anxiety, panic attacks, diminished self-confidence and a deep sense of shame.Some weeks ago, a middle-aged man, whose son lives in Mumbai, received a call from someone who claimed to be from the “Mumbai Police”, who told him that his son had been detained because of “inappropriate behaviour” with a woman. The caller offered to resolve the matter discreetly if a certain amount of money was paid.The worried father managed to scribble a note, asking his wife to call their son, but she was unsuccessful in getting through. The father, anxious to save the family’s reputation, transferred Rs 5 lakh to the fraudsters. It was only after two hours, when his son called them back to explain that he could not take their calls because he was in a work meeting, that he knew he was defrauded.“He experienced deep mental trauma over a sense of guilt and shame because he was constantly thinking how easily he was fooled, despite being an educated person,” said psychiatrist Jay Ranjan Ram of Apollo Multispecialty Hospital, whom he consulted after some days.Ram said his patient had to have several counselling sessions and was prescribed medication.Even cases where scamsters were unsuccessful leave their ‘almost victims’ scarred.Sanjay Garg, consultant, mental health and behavioural sciences at Fortis Anandapur, said this woman felt an acute sense of anxiety when she went to office the next day. “She told me she could not shake off the feeling that her colleagues were discussing her, or were questioning her integrity,” Garg said. “This caused a full-blown panic attack, hospitalisation and subsequent referral to a psychiatrist. Her condition was diagnosed as psychosis, characterized by paranoia, stress and anxiety, depression, aggression towards family members, delusions and disrupted thoughts and perceptions that others intended to harm her,”She is under treatment and is getting better, but she continues to experience anxiety, panic attacks and diminished self-confidence.Another person who was not defrauded, but is still mentally scarred by his experience, is a retired senior govt official from south Kolkata, who received calls from ‘government agency’ representatives, claiming his accounts were involved in hawala transactions. They threatened to arrest him unless he transferred Rs 30 lakh immediately. A visiting friend’s timely intervention prevented the fraud.“This gentleman was scared of social ostracization and loss of face if people came to know that his accounts were used for hawala transactions, even though the accounts weren’t,” said psychiatrist Sabyasachi Mitra of Woodlands Hospital. “His depression relapsed. Even as he is now doing better with counselling and medication, he is yet to come out of the trauma.”Geriatric physician Dhires Kumar Chowdhury, working with Bancnbo, a south Kolkata-based organisation that cares for the elderly, said their members constantly worry about being victims of cyber fraud.“In addition to the insecurity of living alone, with most of their children working in other cities or countries, cybercrime such as digital arrest have instilled another fear in their lives. There have been cases where a couple of our members almost felt prey to such fraud. They live in constant fear,” Chowdhury said.","An increasing number of Kolkatans are seeking out professional mental health support over ways to deal with the fallout of digital arrest.

Keanu Evans, the man who was reportedly attacked by an Indian-origin man on a plane, leading to the latter's arrest, said the viral video of the incident only showed half of what happened. 21-year-old Ishaan Sharma has been charged with battery and is facing a $500 bond after attacking Keanu on a flight to Miami from Philadelphia. A report in WSVN.com said that Sharma allegedly started a fight with Keanu Evans during the flight. Evans said the fight started for no reason.The video of the fight also went viral on social media. Upon landing on Monday night, Miami-Dade Sheriff’s Office deputies immediately handcuffed Sharma and took him into custody. Officials said he had a cut on his face and needed stitches.The report added that cell phone footage showed Evans and Sharma in the middle of the fight as other passengers urged them to stop. “Let him go,” said an unidentified passenger. “Stop, let him go.”A flight attendant reportedly also tried to break up the fight, but was unsuccessful. ""Sir, you have to sit down,” a flight attendant, seen on video, told both of them.Evans told 7News that he was attacked while simply returning to his seat and he did nothing to provoke Sharma. “What I hate is that the video doesn’t capture what started the whole thing, you know?” said Evans. “It only captures me defending myself.”Evans said, “He was doing some, like, dark laugh like, ha ha ha ha ha. And he was saying things like, you, you puny mortal man, if you challenge me, it will result in your death.”Evans said he then went to use the restroom and told the flight attendants what was going on. The flight attendants told him to push the button for assistance if the argument continued. Evans said he pushed the button as Sharma kept threatening him with death.“That’s what made me get up and press the button above me and I just turned around and I looked at him and I responded to him. A lot was going on, and immediately he just got up and he put his forehead on my forehead like he was challenging me.”Evans said the situation quickly escalated and Sharma was “looking at me very angrily and we’re looking eye to eye, forehead to forehead, and then he just grabs me by the throat and just starts choking me.

NEW DELHI: Torrential monsoon rains continue to wreak havoc across Himachal Pradesh, with the death toll climbing to 74 and over three dozen people still missing.In the worst-hit Mandi district, rescue operations intensified on Saturday as authorities scrambled to locate at least 30 individuals feared trapped under debris following flash floods and cloudbursts earlier this week.Search teams from the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), police and army have been deployed but challenging terrain and damaged infrastructure have severely hampered efforts.“We’ve not been able to locate any of the missing persons yet,” said Mandi deputy commissioner Apoorv Devgan, noting that 31 individuals remained unaccounted for.“The relief work is difficult because of the geography. This is only the beginning of the monsoon and we must now manage relief, rehabilitation and restoration over the next three months.”A team from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) has also been deployed in Thunag, one of the worst-affected regions. The team is coordinating with local authorities to assist in rescue, debris removal and aid distribution.The India Meteorological Department has issued a red alert for Sunday, warning of heavy to extremely heavy rainfall accompanied by thunderstorms and lightning, particularly in Mandi, Kangra, and Sirmaur districts.Several other districts including Una, Bilaspur, Hamirpur, Shimla, and Solan have also been placed on high alert.Many parts of Mandi remain cut off due to road damage.On Saturday evening, 238 roads across Himachal were blocked, including 176 in Mandi alone, the State Emergency Operations Centre (SEOC) reported.Essential services also took a hit — 258 power distribution transformers and 289 water supply schemes were disrupted, most of them in Mandi.Between June 20 and July 5, the hill state has suffered an estimated loss of over ₹566.87 crore, with 115 people injured, according to official data. In addition to 45 monsoon-related deaths, 30 accidental fatalities were also reported, including those caused by road accidents, electrocution, and gas explosions.The SEOC confirmed that 20 deaths occurred in Mandi and 13 in Kangra, with 37 people still missing across the state.In response, the government has provided 1,317 food kits containing essential supplies to affected families, while more aid is being mobilised.Chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu on Saturday assured the public that the situation was “rapidly returning to normal” in disaster-hit areas of Seraj constituency. He announced a monthly rent assistance of Rs 5,000 for families whose homes were destroyed in the disaster.“The government is fully committed to tackling this crisis. All departments are on alert as we prepare for more rains,” the CM said.Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Minister Mukesh Agnihotri visited affected areas in Seraj and Nachan constituencies, met with displaced families, and directed officials to expedite road repairs and restore power and clean drinking water.He also announced that the Baglamukhi ropeway would operate free of charge until further notice to aid relief movement, benefiting 1,500 people so far.The ropeway service will be available on call during emergencies.On Saturday, SDRF teams conducted door-to-door assessments in Jarode Panchayat, distributing medical kits and identifying individuals in urgent need of care.Officials said the findings were shared with district authorities to ensure targeted follow-up.Medical personnel provided on-site assistance and essential medicines to residents, while food and daily-need supplies were distributed across affected pockets.","Torrential monsoon rains continue to wreak havoc across Himachal Pradesh, with the death toll climbing to 74 and over three dozen people still missing.

The injuries were said to be minor.Social media footage captured scenes of passengers frantically leaping from the wing and running across the tarmac.Meanwhile, others used the emergency slide on the opposite side, following standard evacuation protocol.An airport employee, quoted by The Sun, remarked: ""Do you know the plane has emergency exits? Now the people are jumping from the wing onto the ground.""Adding to the confusion, some passengers described a lack of clear direction from cabin crew during the alert.According to one distressed mother whose daughter was on board, the crew appeared overwhelmed, as quoted by the Sun: ""One attendant shouted, 'Get off', the other froze and she didn't know what was going on. She looked as shocked as the passengers.""The woman further recounted a harrowing phone call from her daughter during the evacuation: ""My daughter called me and said, 'Mum, I'm trying to get down the slide, I might not survive this and I love you'. It was horrible. I couldn't sleep all night, even after I knew she was safe. They got no support when she got in the airport.""Airport authorities confirmed that the emergency call was received at 12.36 am. A spokesperson for Majorcan emergency services stated, ""We received an alert about a fire on a plane on the ground at Palma airport at 00.36 am today. Four ambulances were sent to the scene which were two basic life support units and two advanced life support units. Eighteen people were injured and received medical assistance of whom six were taken to hospital. They were all minor. Three went to the Clinica Rotger and three to the Palmaplanas Hospital.""Ryanair later clarified that the evacuation was triggered by a false fire warning. In its official statement, the airline said: ""This flight from Palma to Manchester discontinued take-off due to a false fire warning light indication. Passengers were disembarked using the inflatable slides and returned to the terminal.""""While disembarking, a small number of passengers encountered very minor injuries (ankle sprains, etc.) and crew requested immediate medical assistance. To minimise disruption to passengers, we quickly arranged a replacement aircraft to operate this flight, which departed Palma at 07:05 this morning. We sincerely apologise to affected passengers for any inconvenience caused,"" it further added.","At least 18 people injured after fire alert on Ryanair plane in Majorca as passengers leap from wing.

South China Morning Post





Chinese President Xi Jinping will not attend the upcoming Brics Summit in Brazil, marking the first time in 12 years that the Chinese leader will be absent from the annual gathering of major emerging economies.The two-day summit, taking place in Rio de Janeiro on July 6-7, 2025, comes at a point when Xi’s absence is fueling speculation about internal political shifts in China.Gordon Chang, a noted expert on US-China relations, said Xi’s absence may reflect deeper troubles within China’s political hierarchy. “This is another hint that Xi Jinping is losing influence in China’s capital,” Chang posted on X.However China has attributed Xi’s no-show to a “scheduling conflict” and pointed to his earlier meeting this year with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, as reported by the. In Xi’s place, Chinese Premier Li Qiang will lead the delegation, continuing a recent pattern of the Chinese President limiting his appearances on the global stage.Xi will not be the only high-profile absentee. Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close ally of Xi within the group, will participate only via video link. Brazil is a signatory to the International Criminal Court (ICC) over alleged war crimes in Ukraine and would be legally obliged to detain Putin were he to attend in person.The dual absence of Xi and Putin will shift spotlight on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. PM Modi will attend both the Brics summit and is on a state visit to Brazil, positioning India as a central figure in this year’s summit.Brics, originally formed in 2009 with Brazil, Russia, India, and China and joined by South Africa in 2010, seeks to reassert itself as a counterbalance to the Group of Seven (G7). The bloc has recently expanded to include five new members — Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE — in a push to enhance its representation of the Global South.","Chinese President Xi Jinping will not attend the upcoming Brics Summit in Brazil.

KARACHI: The death toll from a collapsed multi-story residential building in southern Pakistan rose to 16 as search operations to find survivors continued for the second day.Rescuers pulled 10 more bodies from the rubble during an overnight operation, officials said Saturday.The govt-run Civil Hospital said in a statement it had received the 16 bodies, adding several of the injured had been hospitalised. Rescue workers are using heavy machinery to search for at least eight more survivors believed to be trapped under the debris, said emergency officials.Residents said the building was located on a narrow street, hampering efforts to bring in additional heavy equipment. Television footage showed rescuers removing debris as relatives of those still trapped cried and prayed for the safety of their loved ones.Building collapses are common in Pakistan, where construction standards are often poorly enforced. Many structures are built with substandard materials, and safety regulations are frequently ignored to cut costs. In June 2020, an apartment building collapsed in Karachi, killing 22.","Rescuers pull 10 more bodies from the rubble during an overnight operation.

SYDNEY: Australian authorities on Saturday condemned what they said was an arson attack on a Melbourne synagogue with worshippers in the building, the latest in a spate of incidents against the nation's Jewish community.The fire at the entrance to the synagogue in the east of Victoria's state capital was sparked on Friday night, police said in a statement. Firefighters extinguished the blaze and there were no injuries to the 20 people inside.The attack, one of several recent anti-semitic incidents in Australia, comes seven months after another synagogue in Melbourne was targeted by arsonists who started a blaze that injured one and caused widespread damage.Victoria Premier Jacinta Allan on Saturday said it was ""absolutely appalling"" that a second Jewish synagogue had been attacked. ""Any attack on a place of worship is an act of hate, and any attack on a Jewish place of worship is an act of anti-Semitism,"" Allan said in a statement.Police said they believed the attack, in which flammable liquid was poured on the synagogue's front door and set alight, was carried out by a male suspect.He has not been identified but is thought to be white and aged in his 30s. There is ""no place in our society for anti-semitic or hate-based behaviour,"" police said.Alex Ryvchin, co-CEO of Executive Council of Australian Jewry, an umbrella group for Australia's Jews, said in a statement the fire was set as those inside sat down to Shabbat dinner.

The Trump administration has deported eight migrants to South Sudan, a US department of homeland security official confirmed, after plans to initially send them to a base in Djibouti were called off.""A district judge cannot dictate the national security and foreign policy of the United States of America,"" assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told ABC News. ""This Independence Day marks another victory for the safety and security of the American people.""The aircraft arrived in South Sudan shortly before midnight on Friday.The eight migrants, whom the department of homeland security alleges have serious criminal convictions, were previously involved in a lawsuit that temporarily halted their deportation to South Sudan, redirecting them instead to a US military base in Djibouti.According to court filings, conditions at the US military base in Djibouti were difficult for both the detainees and the ICE officials assigned to guard them.The case reached the US supreme court, which ruled in a 7-2 decision on Thursday that the Trump administration was not obligated to comply with a lower court order requiring the migrants to remain at the military facility while legal proceedings continued.The ruling marked another legal victory for the Trump administration in its ongoing effort to deport individuals to countries with which they have no direct ties, and where they could potentially face mistreatment.In an unsigned opinion, the US supreme court stated that, following its recent decision to remove judge-imposed due process requirements for third-country deportations, the government can no longer be held accountable for allegedly violating those protections.One of the attorneys representing the group of men described their deportation to South Sudan as “punitive and unconstitutional.”“Because of the supreme court's procedural ruling, these men were denied an opportunity to contest their deportations to South Sudan based on their fear of torture or death,” said Trina Realmuto in a statement to ABC News. “The US state department warns Americans against all travel to South Sudan, yet deported these men there without any due process. Make no mistake about it, these deportations were punitive and unconstitutional. ”",Eight migrants have been deported to South Sudan.

At least 50 people have died in the severe flooding that hit Texas Hill Country early Friday, Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha confirmed as the search continued for dozens of missing girls.The US state's Kerr County was worst affected with 43 deaths followed by Travis County where four people died, as reported by AFP. Two people died in Burnet County while another died in Tom Green County.Earlier, authorities had reported that 27 girls from a Christian summer camp located along the Guadalupe River were among the missing. Officials believe some of the campers may be stranded and unable to reach out for help.A US Congressman has confirmed that his two daughters were safely evacuated from Camp Mystic, the summer camp for girls.Representative August Pfluger announced on Saturday via a post on X that he and his wife have been “now reunited” with their daughters.“The last day has brought unimaginable grief to many families and we mourn with them as well as holding out hope for survivors,” he wrote.“Please join us today as we pray for miracles,” he added.At a news conference on Friday night, Texas Governor Greg Abbott stated that the state is deploying all necessary resources to support ongoing search and rescue operations. This includes personnel from the Texas National Guard and state troopers.Abbott declared a state of disaster for several counties in the Hill Country region, located about 70 miles north of San Antonio. On Saturday, he expanded the declaration to include additional counties affected by the flooding and formally requested federal assistance through a signed disaster declaration.W Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas division of emergency management, said Saturday afternoon that authorities are still ""actively searching"" for survivors, although he acknowledged that the mission ""will turn into recovery at some point.""""When you talk to the men and women that are up there in those helicopters and out in those boats and walking the ground, they're looking for live people right now and doing everything they can to continue to search as fast as possible,"" Kidd said at a press conference.Governor Abbott, also speaking at the briefing, emphasized that he has directed all state agencies involved in the efforts to ""assume everybody missing is alive"" and stressed that ""every minute counts.""More than 850 people have been rescued so far, many with the help of helicopters, according to officials.

In a dramatic turn of events, a young woman was rescued after being swept nearly 32 km down the Guadalupe river and becoming trapped in a tree, following the devastating floods that struck parts of Texas, US, during 4th of July celebrations.According to KEN5S, the 22-year-old woman was discovered clinging desperately to the branches of a Cypress tree, several feet above the ground, as powerful floodwaters surged beneath her.The floods, which have claimed at least 27 lives so far, have also left dozens of young girls missing, prompting large-scale rescue and recovery operations.A homeowner in Center Point heard the woman’s cries for help and rushed to assist her, just in time. One of the tree branches had already broken off, and another was beginning to weaken when he spotted her.“I hear you, I see you,” the homeowner told the woman, as reported by the local television station.The man, whose identity was not disclosed, tried calling 911 but got no response, as the emergency hotline was overwhelmed due to the flooding.Instead, the man ran out to the street and flagged down first responders who were carrying out ongoing search and rescue operations.Rescue crews deployed boats to locate the woman, who had been stuck in the tree for several hours.By the time they reached her, the water level had receded by nearly 10 feet, leaving her no choice but to make a leap of faith from the tree into the rescue boat.The woman, whose identity has not been released, miraculously escaped with only minor scrapes and bruises, a remarkable outcome given that she was swept across four dams and narrowly avoided being hit by floating debris, including refrigerators and cars.She had been camping with her parents and other family members at a campground in Ingram when the rising river pulled her from her tent, according to KEN5SHer family attempted to flee in a vehicle, but it too was swept away by the powerful floodwaters.It remains unclear whether the woman’s family survived the flooding.So far, at least 25 people have been confirmed dead in the disaster, with dozens still reported missing.Among the confirmed fatalities are at least two young campers from Camp Mystic, a Christian sleepaway camp for girls aged between 7 and 17.","A 22-year-old woman was rescued after being swept 32 km down the Guadalupe river and trapped in a tree.

US President Donald Trump on Friday called the flash floods in Texas “terrible” and “shocking” as the death toll rose to 27, including 9 children, with dozens still missing following a powerful storm that swept through the Texas Hill Country overnight.""It's terrible, the floods. It's shocking,"" Trump told reporters, reacting to the devastation as emergency crews rushed to locate missing residents, including at least 24 girls from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp in Kerr County, which was completely destroyed by floodwaters.The Guadalupe River surged over 26 feet in just 45 minutes before dawn Friday, washing away cabins, homes, and vehicles. Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said at least 240 people had been rescued, but many remain unaccounted for as search efforts continue using helicopters, boats, and drones.Crews worked through the early hours of Saturday, navigating debris and swift currents in the dark. “The water’s moving so fast, you’re not going to recognize how bad it is until it’s on top of you,” said Bob Fogarty, a National Weather Service meteorologist, reported AP.Frantic families posted photos of missing children, and a reunification center in Ingram saw tearful reunions as rescued campers arrived. “The camp was completely destroyed,” said 13-year-old Elinor Lester, one of the survivors.“A helicopter landed and started taking people away. It was really scary.”Some residents described having no warning before the flood hit. “We got no emergency alert. There was nothing,” said Matthew Stone. “Then a pitch black wall of death.”Despite claims from local officials that they didn’t anticipate such intense flooding, AccuWeather and the National Weather Service confirmed issuing warnings well before the storm hit. “These warnings should have provided officials with ample time to evacuate camps,” AccuWeather said.Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said alerts were sent but acknowledged that predicting the storm’s precise impact was difficult. “Everything was done to give them a heads up,” he said.More rain is expected through the weekend, with flash flood warnings still in effect. Officials have warned that the danger has not passed.

A former supporter of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has issued a strong warning to young New York City voters following socialist Zohran Mamdani ’s win in the Democratic primary.In a video posted on X, Lucy Biggers said,“If I was 25, I would’ve been obsessed with Zohran,”“Now I’m 35, and I’ve grown up. The feel-good promises of free college, free food, free housing might sound great, but they don’t work,” she added.She goes on to share her opinion that socialist policies drive wealthy residents away, making the cities poorer, leading to higher taxes for those who remain, with few benefits in return.Biggers, a media professional, says she played a key role in transforming AOC from a little-known figure into a political powerhouse in 2018.“I met AOC when she was basically a nobody. And I really thought she had something special going on, so I booked her for an interview at our studios,” Biggers told The New York Post.She created a viral video for the media outlet NowThis, which Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign eventually paid to promote on social media.“They downloaded it, and they used it as a campaign asset… they used it as a digital ad,” said Biggers, who now works with The Free Press as social media editor.Back in 2018, AOC sent shock waves across the American political landscape when she defeated 10-term incumbent Representative Joe Crowley in the Democratic primaries for the 14th Congressional district of New York. Later that November she went on to win the midterm elections.“The video got her message out. At that time, no one cared about AOC, she was not on cable news,” Biggers recalled.Seven years later, Biggers, now a mother of two and a homeowner in Connecticut, has started to see things differently.She said the pandemic and the effects of government spending were major turning points for her.“As you grow up, you start to see the world less black and white. You can’t sell this bill of goods that promises to create a utopia in America,” said Biggers, who works in the city.“There’s a glorification of socialism among young people. They don’t know what happened in Cuba, Venezuela, the USSR. They glamorize these countries and are indoctrinated into thinking the US is bad. It’s very naive… it’s embarrassing,” she said, talking about her own views back in time..She went on to add that while the voter enthusiasm for Mamdani is genuine, it's completely misguided.“It’s young people who want to make a change. And he ran a really great campaign honestly,” she said.“But I just think it’s selling a fantasy that ultimately doesn’t work.”","Lucy Biggers, 35, says she played a key role in transforming AOC from a little- known figure into a political powerhouse in 2018.

A large group of protesters opposing federal immigration enforcement filled downtown streets on Friday, July 4, turning a tense standoff with authorieties.Demonstrators gathered outside City Hall on Spring Street at about 9 am for what organisers called as a “march against ICE, federal occupation in downtown LA.”By 3 pm the march had reached the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building on Alameda Street, between Temple and Aliso Streets. The crowd remained outside the complex for three hours, chanting against recent immigration raids while flanked by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officers, Customs and Border Protection personnel and US Marines.Tensions spiked when DHS declared an unlawful assembly. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) later posted on X, “Demonstrators are confronting Federal Protective Security Personnel and National Guard Members,” adding that federal agents had deployed less‑lethal munitions and urging residents to avoid the area.National Guard troops and federal agents formed a skirmish line, ordering protesters to disperse. When the crowd blocked several lanes of Alameda Street, LAPD issued a formal dispersal order at 7:05 pm. Most demonstrators left soon after.Police closed Alameda Street between First and Aliso Streets, and First Street between San Pedro and Alameda Streets, for roughly an hour to clear debris and restore traffic.Organisers said the march was a response to a series of immigration raids that began last month across the Los Angeles area. They also pointed to the Trump administration’s decision to deploy National Guard soldiers and Marines amid growing protests.","Demonstrators gathered outside City Hall on Spring Street at about 9 am for what organisers called as a “march against ICE, federal occupation in downtown LA” By 3 pm the march had reached the Edward R.

Rescue teams in Pakistan continued to search for survivors on Saturday after a six-storey residential building collapsed in Karachi's Lyari neighbourhood, killing 16 people and injuring 13 others, according to local officials.The building came down around 10am on Friday in the Baghdadi area of Lyari, a densely populated and impoverished part of the city. Residents said they heard cracking sounds shortly before the collapse. Rescue workers, battling high heat and humidity, have been working through the night. At least eight people are still believed to be trapped under the debris.Summiaya Syed, a police surgeon with the provincial health department, confirmed the death toll at 16 and said 13 others had been injured.Dev Raj, 54, told AFP his daughter was still under the rubble.

Javed Nabi Khoso, a senior district government official, said, ""We don't want to impose our orders by force. We work in phases and send them notices to leave the building. They didn't take the notices seriously.""The building had long been declared ""dangerous"" by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), which claimed that repeated eviction notices had been issued, according to ARY News.Locals, however, disputed the SBCA's claims, alleging that no such formal warnings were communicated.Commissioner Karachi Hassan Naqvi, who visited the site after 13 hours, laid blame on residents who continued living in unsafe structures.SBCA data reveals that Karachi currently has 578 buildings marked as unsafe, with District South holding the highest number of structurally compromised structures.Officials also confirmed that an adjacent building to the one that collapsed has suffered structural damage and is now under observation.However, Imran Khaskheli, a building owner and resident, denied receiving any notice. ""Do you think we are out of our senses to stay in an unsafe building with our families?"" he asked. He said he noticed cracks in the pillars early Friday and warned families to evacuate.

The lion was then seen chasing other pedestrians as bystanders scrambled to escape.According to a police statement citing the children's father, quoted by AFP, the lion attacked his kids aged five and seven years, after injuring the mother, causing injuries to their arms and faces.The victims received hospital treatment, though their injuries were not life-threatening.The father's statement in the police report indicated that the lion's owners appeared entertained by the attack on pedestrians.Three individuals were arrested in connection to the case by police on Friday. ""The suspects departed with the lion but were apprehended within 12 hours of the incident,"" the Lahore Deputy Inspector General Operations office told AFP.The 11-month-old male lion was seized by authorities and transferred to a wildlife sanctuary, where the staff confirmed the animal's healthy condition.In Pakistan's most populated province of Punjab, keeping exotic animals, particularly large felines, has traditionally indicated status and influence.In December 2024, a security guard fatally shot an adult lion that had escaped its enclosure in another Lahore district, causing panic among residents.This event led the provincial administration to implement new regulations governing the trade, purchase, breeding and ownership of large cats.Current regulations require owners to obtain proper licences for these animals, which are prohibited in residential zones. Breeders must pay substantial registration fees, and farms must occupy at least 10 acres of land.","A runaway pet lion attacked a woman and two children on a busy street in Lahore, Pakistan, according to police statements.

Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari revealed that Islamabad does not know the current whereabouts of UN-designated terrorist Masood Azhar , and suggested he may be in Afghanistan.""As far as Masood Azhar is concerned, we have been unable to arrest him or identify him given his past within the Afghan Jihad context.

But suffice to say it's beyond that now.”He insisted that Pakistan had met the rigorous requirements of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and pointed to the convictions of individuals for terror financing and the seizure of over 90 institutions linked to extremist outfits.On the issue of Hafiz Saeed , another figure of concern to India, Bhutto flatly denied reports that he was a free man. “That’s factually not correct… He is in the custody of the Pakistani state,” he said.The former Pakistani foreign minister’s comments come amid growing international scrutiny of Pakistan's track record on tackling terrorism, and just weeks after the Global Terrorism Index 2025 placed the country as the second-most terrorism-affected nation in the world.The GTI reported a 45 per cent increase in terrorism-related deaths in Pakistan, linking the surge to the growing influence of militant groups along the Afghanistan border.",Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari revealed that Islamabad does not know the current whereabouts of UN-designated terrorist Masood Azhar.
