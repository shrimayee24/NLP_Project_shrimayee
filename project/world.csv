Pak attempts terror push with ceasefire breach in Poonch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pak-attempts-terror-push-with-ceasefire-breach-in-poonch/articleshow/118188927.cms,"(PTI photo)

JAMMU: Pakistani soldiers violated the ceasefire by firing without provocation in forward areas along the LoC in J&K’s Poonch district Wednesday evening. Security sources said the attack was an attempt to push terrorists into India, using cover fire as a decoy.“Our border guards gave a befitting response in equal calibre. There are no immediate reports of casualties or damage on our side,” an official source said.The two nations had earlier agreed to the “strict observance” of all peace and ceasefire agreements. However, Pakistan has repeatedly breached the accord.One of the most blatant violations occurred on Sept 11 last year, when gunfire from across the border killed a BSF trooper in Akhnoor sector of Jammu, and another was shot dead when Pakistan Rangers fired at Indian posts in Samba in Nov 2023.The latest firing comes amid rising hostilities along the LoC. Security forces anticipate an early start to infiltration attempts this year as melting snow in mountainous regions eases movement for terrorists.“The winter lull, which typically stretches for several months, may be shorter than usual this year due to rising temperatures,” a security source said.Recent attacks highlight the growing threat. On Monday, a bullet fired from across the border hit a soldier at a forward post in Nowshera sector of Rajouri district. On Feb 8, gunfire from a forest across the LoC targeted an Army patrol in Keri sector of Rajouri.On Tuesday, Captain Karamjit Singh Bakshi, 27, and Naik Mukesh Singh Manhas, 29, lost their lives in an IED attack near the LoC in Akhnoor.Security sources estimate 70 to 80 Pakistani terrorists are active in J&K, with 55 to 60 in Jammu region. These “highly trained intruders” operate in small groups, equipped with weapons like M4 carbines and thermal imaging devices. Their ability to coordinate attacks in the rugged terrain, which offers ample natural cover, poses a major challenge.","Pakistani soldiers violated the ceasefire by firing without provocation in forward areas along the LoC in J&K’s Poonch district.

BHOPAL: Gwalior cyber police arrested three students from a hostel in Noida for alleged links with a syndicate that trapped a BSF officer in digital arrest for a month and scammed him of over Rs 71 lakh. The suspects were identified as Aftab Ahmed Khan, a BTech student from Jharkhand, Akhil Singh Bais, a BBA student from Delhi, and a class 12 student from Kota, Rajasthan.The racketeers, posing as Mumbai Crime Branch officers, had threatened to arrest the BSF inspector's wife and son and forced him into making 34 transactions. The victim - who is on the verge of retirement and now posted at BSF Academy in Tekanpur, Gwalior - was told that his Aadhaar card had been used for money laundering . Desperate to save his family, he sold off his flat, mortgaged his land and borrowed from friends.Gwalior cyber cops said the youngsters had been cyber-scamming people for two years. The money scammed was transferred to bank accounts in Karnataka, Aurangabad, and Gurgaon.Police said accused would persuade students to open bank accounts, which were then handed over to a Chinese gang. Some 20 accounts have been traced so far. When fraudulently obtained money was deposited, the accused would deduct a 6% commission and convert the remaining amount into USDT, which was then routed to the Chinese gang.","The suspects were identified as Aftab Ahmed Khan, a BTech student from Jharkhand.

"PILs claim provisions of UCC discriminatory, HC notice to Uttarakhand, Centre",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pils-claim-provisions-of-ucc-discriminatory-hc-notice-to-uttarakhand-centre/articleshow/118192862.cms,"Representative image

Marriages among close kin should be barred in any civilised society: SG

DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand high court has issued notices to the Centre and the state govt, directing them to respond within six weeks, while hearing public interest litigations challenging the provisions of the Uniform Civil Code that came into effect in the state last month. Among other submissions, the petitioners have claimed that the Act discriminates against Muslims.The PILs were filed by actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui's Dehradun-based brother Elmashuddin, Suresh Singh Negi from Bhimtal, and Ikram from Haridwar. They argued that the Act is ""discriminatory in nature since it takes away the customs and usage of the Muslim community by providing for restrictions to marry in 'degrees of prohibited relationship' as defined in the UCC"". They added that in the Muslim community, these restrictions do not exist and that marriage among relatives is permissible.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta , appearing virtually for the state government, pointed to the bench that Schedule 1 and 2 of the code, which define ""degrees of prohibited relationships"", include relationships such as mother, stepmother, daughter, son's widow, and other close relatives. He said, ""Such marriages among close relatives should be regulated by law and prohibited in any civilised society.""When the petitioners' lawyer, Kartikey Hari Gupta, contended that there should be no objection to permitting a Muslim man to marry his mother's sister's daughter or mother's brother's daughter, Mehta responded, ""For the petitioner to succeed on this ground, he will have to show a fundamental right of any individual to marry his sister, failing which he cannot challenge such a provision which is required in any civilised society.""The division bench consolidated two additional petitions challenging UCC on different grounds with this case and scheduled the matter for a hearing after six weeks. While Bhimtal resident and former student representative Suresh Singh Negi's PIL challenges numerous provisions of UCC, particularly those concerning live-in relationships, another PIL by Aarushi Gupta disputes the provisions related to marriage, divorce, and live-in relationships, asserting that they violate citizens' fundamental rights.The petitioners contested the mandatory registration of live-in relationships and the penal provisions for non-compliance, maintaining these requirements breach Right to Privacy guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. Mehta argued, ""Experience has shown that having lived in live-in relationships without any commitment, which results only from marriage, generally, the man deserts the woman, leaving her destitute and leaving the children born out of such relationships illegitimate.""He added that the code does not prohibit live-in relationships but regulates them by requiring registration. ""On such a registration, the child born out of such a live-in relationship is considered under UCC to be a legitimate child, and the deserted woman is given a right to approach the competent court seeking maintenance for herself and her child,"" Mehta said. On the petitioners' contention that the Act is discriminatory since it exempts people belonging to Scheduled Tribe, the SG said, ""Uniform Civil Code is not made applicable to the persons belonging to Scheduled Tribes in view of the specific protection granted in Part XXI of the Constitution and all Scheduled Tribes within the meaning of Clause 25 of Article 366 read with Article 342 form a separate class. Therefore, there is no discrimination.""","The Uttarakhand high court has issued notices to the Centre and the state govt, directing them to respond within six weeks. The court is hearing public interest litigations challenging the provisions of the Uniform Civil Code.

Rajat's lover's family files plaint, accuses him of poisoning her

MUZAFFARNAGAR/ROORKEE: It was a cold December night in 2022 when Rajat Kumar and Nishu spotted a crumpled Mercedes - upside down, smouldering - near Roorkee on Delhi-Dehradun highway. They didn't know then that the man they pulled from the wreckage, half-conscious and bleeding, was cricketer Rishabh Pant . They called the police and stayed on till help arrived. Pant later said they were ""heroes who helped me... I'll be forever grateful and indebted"".Months after Pant gifted him a scooter as a token of gratitude, Rajat is fighting for his life in a hospital, accused of a crime he insists he didn't commit. On Sunday, Rajat, 25, and his girlfriend Manu Kashyap (21), consumed poison together. Their love was not meant to last - different castes, disapproving families, marriages arranged elsewhere.In despair, Rajat and his lover made a suicide pact , or so it seemed. A resident of their village, Buchha Basti, spotted them writhing on the ground and raised the alarm. By the time their families arrived, much damage was done. They were rushed to a local hospital. Manu's family transferred her to another facility, where she died before dawn on Tuesday, while Rajat, barely clinging to life, is still in treatment.Then, hours after Manu was cremated, her mother walked into Purkazi police station and filed a murder complaint against Rajat, accusing him of poisoning her daughter.Now, the village that once took pride in Rajat's bravery whispers about scandal. In a place where ""family honour"" is currency, a young man and woman trying to defy caste and family expectations is not just a personal crisis - it is a communal one.Muzaffarnagar SP Satyanarayan Prajapat said no police case had been filed until Manu's mother intervened. The local police have turned their attention to Manu's mother's allegations. ""We have received a written complaint from the woman's family, accusing Rajat of poisoning her,"" Singh told TOI.Doctors said Rajat is showing signs of recovery. ""Both consumed a strong pesticide,"" said Dr Dinesh Tripathi of Pragya Hospital. ""We began immediate treatment.

The United States has agreed to release Russian national Alexander Vinnik , who was accused of major cybercrime operations , in return for American citizen Marc Fogel , according to a US official's statement on Wednesday.Fogel, who had been imprisoned since August 2021 by Russia, returned to American soil on Tuesday.US national security adviser Mike Waltz said the exchange of Fogel was a ""show of good faith"" from Moscow and was a sign that ties between the US and Russia were heading in a direction which could usher in negotiations over the war in Ukraine.Vinnik was the operator of BTC-e , a prominent cryptocurrency exchange platform. His arrest took place in 2017 in a northern Greek coastal village following US authorities' request, facing allegations of laundering $4 billion through his exchange platform.US investigators connected Vinnik to the Mt. Gox incident, a Japanese bitcoin exchange that ceased operations in 2014 after a security breach. The Justice Department stated that Vinnik acquired funds from the Mt. Gox breach and processed them through BTC-e and his San Francisco-based platform, Tradehill, Reuters reported.Following extradition to France and subsequently to the United States, Vinnik admitted guilt to money laundering conspiracy charges in May 2024.

I’m sorry.” He also shared a video, saying “My comment wasn’t appropriate. It wasn’t even funny. Comedy is not my forte”.He further added “I’m just here to say sorry. Many of you asked if this is how I wished to use my platform and obviously this is not how I wish to use it. I am not going to give any context or justification or reasoning behind whatever happened. I’m just here for an apology.”“I personally had a lapse in judgement. I wasn't cool on my part. The podcast was watched by people of all ages. Don’t want to be the kind of person that takes responsibility lightly and family is the last thing I would ever disrespect.”He further added “Need to use this platform better. That’s been my learning from this whole experience. I promise to just get better. Have asked the makers of the video to remove the insensitive sections from the video.”“All I can say in the end is sorry. Hope you forgive me as a human being,” he reiterated.During the episode, Ranveer asked a contestant a controversial question: “Would you rather watch your parents have sex every day or join them to finish it once and for all?”.While the comment sparked cheers and laughter from the panel, including host Samay Raina, but it left viewers outraged. Many condemned it as offensive and inappropriate, triggering a wave of online backlash.The controversy has since become a trending topic on X (formerly Twitter), with users condemning Ranveer’s comments while also poking fun at the situation through memes. Some memes sarcastically compared Ranveer’s behavior to his usual motivational persona on BeerBiceps , while others also called for tighter regulation of online shows like India’s Got Latent, arguing that the lack of boundaries in the name of humor is becoming problematic.","YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia landed in hot water after his appearance on stand-up comedian Samay Raina ’s YouTube show, India’s Got Latent.

'Defending existence'

Worcester, Massachusetts has become one of the first cities in the United States to declare itself a sanctuary for transgender people since Donald Trump won the presidential race and returned to office, New York Post reports.In a 9-2 vote on Tuesday night, with over 200 people present, the Massachusetts city council passed a resolution declaring the state’s second-largest city a haven for trans and gender-diverse people.The resolution is not legally binding but ensures the city won’t use its resources to detain anyone for seeking or providing gender-affirming care . It also bars local authorities from helping out-of-state groups trying to interfere with such healthcare.The city had previously allocated $500,000 towards resources for its LGBTQ community.The move comes in direct response to Trump’s sweeping federal policies on gender, including an executive order that restricts the use of federal funds for child sex-change treatments and another banning biological males from competing in women’s sports.Trump's Republican and conservative base has always condemned the ""radical left"" on gender policies. During his inauguration speech, he declared that the federal government would recognise only two genders—male and female—and vowed to “defeat the toxic poison of gender ideology.”“The trans, nonbinary, and LGBTQIA+ community in Worcester and nationally are being attacked by President Trump,” the resolution said.Before Trump's re-election, cities like San Francisco, Sacramento, Pittsburgh, and Ithaca had already declared themselves trans sanctuaries. Worcester, home to over 207,000 people, is believed to be the first to do so in response to his new policies.The vote followed weeks of public discussion, culminating in a city council session featuring poetry readings and drag performances. Many residents spoke about the need for the resolution.“It’s absolutely exhausting to continue to have to defend your existence. Say the words, say the words that we’d be safe here,” said one speaker, as reported by Boston 25 News.“When the president of the United States, in his inauguration speech, says that you do not exist, it should matter at our local level,” said Joshua Croke, co-founder of a Worcester LGBTQ non-profit for children.While the resolution carries no legal force, its passage signals Worcester’s strong stance against federal policies that activists say endanger the rights and safety of transgender and gender-diverse people.Councilor-At-Large Khrystian King backed his colleague and the petition, stating to NBC Boston News, ""We are a haven. We do not tolerate discrimination, bullying, harassment, violence, threats.""","Worcester, Massachusetts has become one of the first cities in the United States to declare itself a sanctuary for transgender people.

Human rights abuses inflicted on Bangladesh Hindus: UN,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/human-rights-abuses-inflicted-on-bangladesh-hindus-un/articleshow/118196638.cms,"Sheikh Hasina (File photo)

UN reports rights abuses in B'desh 2024 protest response, estimates 1,400 killed

DHAKA: A UN report released on Wednesday found that human rights abuses were inflicted on members of Bangladesh's Hindu, Ahmadiyya Muslim and indigenous communities during the anti-discrimination protests that led to Sheikh Hasina govt's fall and its aftermath in 204.While 100 arrests related to attacks on distinct religious & indigenous groups have reportedly been made, perpetrators of many other acts of revenge violence and targeted attacks on such groups still enjoy impunity, UN Human Rights Office said. After fall of the govt, ""widespread attacks were reported against Hindu homes, businesses and places of worship"", it said. The report validates India's repeated claims of targeted attacks on Hindus & temples.Widespread attacks were reported against Hindu homes, businesses, and places of worship, especially in rural and historically tense areas such as Thakurgaon, Lalmonirhat and Dinajpur, as well as other places such as Sylhet, Khulna, and Rangpur"", said the UN report titled 'Human Rights Violations and Abuses related to Protests of July and August 2024 in Bangladesh'.These destructions were especially prevalent in areas perceived to be sympathetic to the Awami League as Hindus have often been stereotypically associated with this political faction, it added. The report, based on the deaths reported by various credible sources, also estimated that as many as 1,400 people may have been killed during July 1-Aug 15 last year and thousands were injured, the vast majority of whom were shot by Bangladesh's security forces.""Bangladesh's former govt, security and intelligence services, alongside violent elements associated with Awami League, systematically engaged in a range of serious human rights violations during last year's student-led protests,"" it added.Former PM Sheikh Hasina left the country on Aug 5 and Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt began its journey three days later. The report released by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights documented ""troubling instances"" of retaliatory killings and revenge violence during the student-led protests. It stated that security and intelligence services ""systematically engaged"" in rights violations that could amount to crimes against humanity.UN Human Rights chief Volker Turk described the response as a ""calculated and well-coordinated strategy"" by the Hasina govt to retain power amid mass opposition. ""Hundreds of extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, detentions, and torture"" were carried out with political leadership's knowledge and coordination, he added.Director of Rights and Risks Analysis Group (RRAG) Suhas Chakma criticised the report for not identifying individual officers responsible for the carnage, citing the limitations of Yunus's interim govt, which restricted the investigation period from July 5 to Aug 15, 2024.The report also includes recommendations to reform Bangladesh's security and justice sectors. ""The interim govt must ensure that violent crimes targeting supporters of Awami League, police officers, or members of distinct religious and indigenous groups are promptly and independently investigated with due diligence and that identified perpetrators are brought to justice,"" it said.","UN reports rights abuses in B'desh 2024 protest response, estimates 1,400 killed. 100 arrests related to attacks on distinct religious & indigenous groups have reportedly been made. perpetrators of many other acts of revenge violence and targeted attacks on such groups still enjoy impunity.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118196706,imgsize-566875,width-400,resizemode-4/118196706.jpg"

The Ukrainian defence ministry is offering men between the ages of 18 and 24 a signing bonus of 1 million hryvnias (around Rs 20 lakhs) along with a monthly salary of 120,000 hryvnias (Rs 2.9 lakhs), in a bid to bolster its forces amid growing battlefield challenges, news agency AP reported.Currently, Ukraine's military draft applies to men aged 25 to 60, after the conscription age was lowered from 27 last year. However, this move has not been sufficient to replenish the ranks, with many draft-age men either moving abroad or avoiding service. Desertions have also been an issue, weakening Ukraine’s ability to counter Russian advances, particularly in the east, where its forces are under pressure.The new recruitment offer also includes additional benefits such as a 0% mortgage rate, scholarships for higher education, enhanced healthcare including dental care, and permission to leave the country after one year of service. Recruits will also receive a draft waiver for 12 months following the completion of their contract.The initiative comes at a time when Ukraine is struggling to maintain troop numbers, and concerns have grown over whether military aid from the United States will continue if Donald Trump returns to office. The Biden administration had previously urged Ukraine to lower its draft age to 18, but Kyiv has opted for voluntary enlistment with financial incentives instead.However, the offer risks stirring discontent among existing military personnel. Soldiers performing rear-guard duties such as planning, logistics, and air defence earn approximately 30,000 hryvnias (Rs 72,000) per month, far less than the 120,000 hryvnias promised to new recruits. Currently, only soldiers in direct combat zones receive salaries at that level, and it remains unclear whether new recruits will be paid the same if stationed elsewhere.Meanwhile, tensions remain high at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, where Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of obstructing the rotation of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) staff. Russian forces seized control of the plant early in the invasion, and both sides have repeatedly accused one another of endangering nuclear safety. Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry claimed Russia deliberately disrupted the rotation of IAEA experts, while Moscow accused Ukrainian forces of blocking access and launching drone attacks on the convoy transporting the personnel.Separately, Ukraine announced the arrest of a high-ranking security official accused of working for Russia. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) stated that Vasyl Maliuk, head of the agency, personally led the operation, codenamed ""Rat."" The detained official, reportedly a chief-of-staff within the SBU’s Anti-Terrorist Centre, is accused of passing sensitive information to Russia. The SBU claims to have documented 14 instances of espionage and has charged the suspect with high treason, which carries a potential life sentence.","Ukrainian defence ministry offers men between 18 and 24 a signing bonus of 1 million hryvnias (around Rs 20 lakhs) Recruits will also receive a monthly salary of 120,000 hryVnias.

All 47 Democrats voted against Gabbard.McConnell said he did not vote for Gabbard as he was concerned that Gabbard refused to label Edward Snowden as a traitor. “Edward Snowden’s treasonous betrayal of the United States and its most sensitive lawful intelligence activities endangered sources, methods and lives,” McConnell said in a statement after the vote. McConnell said it would be risking to “empowering a DNI who only acknowledged the value of critical intelligence collection authorities when her nomination appeared to be in jeopardy.”McConnell voted on Monday in favor of a procedural motion to advance Gabbard’s nomination to a final up-or-down vote.McConnell also voted a 'no' on defence secretary Pete Hegseth forcing Vice President JD Vance to break the tie and confirm him in his new position.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer made an appeal to the senators to reject Gabbard on the ground that she lacked the judgment and qualifications to lead the intelligence officials around the world.“I feel so strongly I just wanted to make one last plea to my Republican colleagues,” Schumer said before the vote. “We simply cannot in good conscience trust our most classified secrets to someone who echoes Russian propaganda and falls for conspiracy theories,” he said.Republicans slammed McConnell and called for his removal from the Senate.

As Elon Musk started speaking, prompted by Donald Trump, briefing about the astounding findings of his Department of Government Efficiency, he was interrupted by X who was trying to repeat every word his father was saying.Elon Musk paused and asked X not to do it with a laugh and then X turned his attention toward Donald Trump who was sitting in his chair and listening to Elon's statements. He was seen approaching the president and whispering something. Trump did not engage with him and then he was seen picking his nose and wiping it off the Resolute Desk.Several videos are claiming that X said: ""I want you to shut your mouth "". Some even claimed that X told the president: ""I want you to shut your f**king mouth up"". Social media users claimed this was a hot mic for X who apparently also whispered to Trump: ""You are not the president, you need to go away"".While these are all social media speculations, X did ask the journalists to shut up as his father was speaking when he was perched on his head. But his whispers to President Trump remain to conjecture as some noted that X was not asking President Trump to 'shut up' but he was whispering looking at some journalist.

Donald Trump Gaza: Boris Johnson says Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago is an 'absolutely fantastic place' to resettle Gazans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boris-johnson-says-donald-trumps-mar-a-lago-is-an-absolutely-fantastic-place-to-resettle-gazans/articleshow/118190433.cms,"Boris Johnson said Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago will be a fine place to resettle Palestinians from Gaza.

Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson made fun of President Donald Trump's Gaza takeover plan and said Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate would be a fantastic place to resettle the Palestinians who Trump said would have to vacate the Gaza strip when he rebuilds the area. Donald Trump indicated that he is serious about his Gaza makeover plan which won't involve the US military or US dollars but it would be like a real estate development. Trump, however, said that the Palestinians would have no right to return to the redeveloped Gaza because they would have many better options.Trump said Palestinians will have to be moved out of Gaza and accommodated in neighboring Arab countries which human rights experts have said would amount to ethnic cleansing.“I actually happened to be giving a speech in Florida the other day and I looked at the beach at Mar-a-Lago and I thought: ‘This is absolutely a fantastic place if you wanted to resettle millions of people from the Middle East, absolutely beautiful,’” Johnson told the World Government Summit in Dubai.""It’s not gonna happen because somebody else owns it. And Gaza is, in law, owned and occupied by people who have a right to be there,"" Boris Johnson said mockingly as Donald Trump yesterday said that he doesn't need to buy Gaza because there's nothing to buy. ""We're going to take it, we're going to hold it, we're going to cherish it.""Jordan's King Abdullah II met Donald Trump at the White House and said he's ready to take about 2,000 sick children from war-torn Gaza. He told Trump that Egypt was working on a plan for how the Arab countries in the region could work with Donald Trump's proposal. ""I reiterated Jordan's steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. This is the unified Arab position. Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all,"" Abdullah said on social media.",Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson made fun of President Donald Trump's Gaza takeover plan.

The ministry said its embassy in Tripoli had “dispatched a team” to a local hospital at the site near Marsa Dela port for the identification.Late Tuesday, the ministry disclosed that of the 63 Pakistanis on the boat, the bodies of 16 had been fished out and 37 rescued, while 10 were still missing. “Three of the survivors are in Tripoli, being looked after by the (Pakistani) embassy,” the ministry said in a statement.The tragedy unfolded less than a month after 50 Pakistanis died when a boat with 86 migrants to Europe capsized off Morocco on January 16. Before that, at least 300 Pakistanis had drowned in a migrant boat that sank off Greece in June 2023, with Italy their intended destination.In a travel alert, Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has identified Libya as one of 15 transit countries used for human trafficking.Each year, thousands of Pakistanis pay traffickers large sums for risky and illegal journeys to Europe, hoping to find work and send money back to their families. Many also take these perilous routes to escape conflicts and religious persecution.Pakistani authorities claim human smugglers send migrants seeking illegal entry into Europe to Libya, located around 300km from Italy. From there, they either take them by boat to Europe or relocate them to the coastal cities of Morocco and Mauritania in west Africa.On Monday, UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said it was “deeply alarmed” by the dozens of migrants’ bodies found in mass graves in southeastern Libya. Two days back, Libyan authorities claimed they had found the bodies of 28 sub-Saharan migrants in the southeastern district of Kufra, near a site where they were allegedly detained and tortured.The UN agency expressed shock at the discovery of two mass graves in Libya with bodies of dozens of migrants, some with gunshot wounds.

ISLAMABAD: At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank at the weekend off the coast of Libya , officials said Tuesday.The ministry of foreign affairs said that 33 of the 37 survivors were in Libyan police custody and one was being treated at a hospital. An estimated 65 people were on the boat, it said.Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his deep grief and sorrow for those lost in the capsizing in Marsa Dela port in the western city of Zawiya.Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to complete the process of identifying the victims and provide assistance to those affected. He also ordered action against those involved ""in heinous acts like human trafficking,"" according to a statement.Most of the victims came from Kurram, a district in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan , where hundreds of people have been killed in recent years in sectarian clashes.""People try to travel to Europe through illegal means because of unemployment"" at home, said Javed Hussain, a nephew of Shehzad Hussain, one of the victims. He said mourners were gathering at the homes of those who perished in the latest tragedy.In January, authorities said dozens of Pakistanis died when a boat capsized off West Africa. Some of the survivors later accused smugglers of killing 43 migrants in a dispute over payment. Pakistan has since confirmed the deaths of 13 of its nationals.Hundreds of Pakistanis die every year while trying to reach Europe by land and sea with the help of human smugglers. They also use dangerous land and sea routes to reach Europe in an effort to find jobs.Libya, which has borders with six nations and a long shore on the Mediterranean, was plunged into chaos following a Nato-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Since then, the oil-rich country has emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East for Europe.At least 674 migrants were reported dead and more than 1,000 missing off Libya in 2024, according to the International Organization for Migration's missing migrants project. More than 21,700 migrants were intercepted and returned to the chaos-stricken country.In 2023, the IOM reported 962 migrants dead and 1,563 missing off Libya. Around 17,200 migrants were intercepted and returned to Libya that year, it said.Those who are returned are held in government-run detention centers rife with abuses, including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture - practices that amount to crimes against humanity, according to UN-commissioned investigators. The abuse often accompanies attempts to extort money from the families of the imprisoned migrants before releasing them or allowing them to leave Libya on traffickers' boats to Europe.","At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank off Libya.

Pakistani lawyers stage protest against high-level meeting of constitutional body to pick eight SC judges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-lawyers-stage-protest-against-high-level-meeting-of-constitutional-body-to-pick-eight-sc-judges/articleshow/118118105.cms,"Representative image (Image credits: ANI)

ISLAMABAD: Hundreds of lawyers on Monday staged protests in Pakistan's national capital against a high-level meeting of a constitutional body with the agenda to appoint at least eight judges of the supreme court. The judicial commission of Pakistan (JCP) meeting was being held despite opposition by four apex court judges, the legal fraternity, resistance by opposition the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and controversy over the recent transfer of judges to the Islamabad high court (IHC), which was opposed by five IHC judges.The JCP, a top body empowered to approve judicial appointments, will finalise appointments for eight vacant supreme court judges.Lawyers gathered at various locations in Islamabad, with the lawyers' action committee staging a protest near D-Chowk. But police responded by closing several key entry points to the Red Zone, which houses key buildings, including the supreme court.Dozens of protestors gathered at Serena Chowk as they were stopped from going to the supreme court due to the closure of the Red Zone. They chanted ""Azaadi"" (freedom) and ""Lawyers' unity zindabad"" (long live lawyers' unity). They were also holding a banner written in Urdu and reading "" 26th constitutional amendment unacceptable"".Clashes were also reported between lawyers and police when they tried to enter the Red Zone. However, there was no report of any arrest or injury during the protest.The protest led to the suspension of metro bus services on multiple routes between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, causing significant inconvenience for commuters. The closure of the Red Zone has caused traffic disruptions, leading to heavy congestion on different roads in the capital.Earlier, the legal fraternity in the country was already expressing concerns against the new appointments and transfers following the controversial 26th constitutional amendment passed last year.The lawyers' representatives had held a convention at the Islamabad district courts, opposing the 26th amendment and demanding the cancellation of the JCP meeting.They also announced on February 3 to protest against the transfer of three high court judges to the IHC but it could not elicit a widespread response. The Karachi bar association had supported the strike call by staying away.Last month, the Lahore high court bar association (LHCBA) moved an application before the apex court through advocate Muhammad Waqar Rana, seeking postponement of the JCP meeting.The JCP earlier this month asked all high courts to send a list of five senior judges from each for consideration for the appointment of eight of them to the supreme court.Initially, the IHC had forwarded the names of three judges - chief justice Aamer Farooq, justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb - to the JCP because justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Babar Sattar did not meet the minimum requirement of five years of service.However, as justice Sarfraz Dogar was made the IHC senior puisne judge following his transfer there from the Lahore high court, his name has also been sent to the JCP.Days before justice Dogar's name was added, five judges of the IHC approached chief justice Yahya Afridi and IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq to reclaim their seniority.Separately, four SC judges, senior puisne judge justice Mansoor Ali Shah, justice Munib Akhtar, justice Ayesha Malik and justice Athar Minallah, in a letter to the chief justice showed concerns last week and are also seeking the postponement of today's JCP session until a decision is made on the petitions against the 26th Amendment.The opposition PTI party in a letter to the chief justice on Sunday asked to postpone the commission's meeting.The 13-member JCP is led by the chief justice and includes four judges of the apex court, as well as parliamentarians from both the treasury and opposition and others.The lawyers and opposition allege that the government was trying to 'pack' the top judiciary with hand-picked judges to influence the fate of political cases, a concern rejected by the government.","Hundreds of lawyers stage protests in Islamabad against high-level meeting of constitutional body.

Policemen at the checkpost offered stiff resistance in an encounter which lasted two hours, following which the terrorists fled,” the provincial police said in a statement.Pakistan has experienced an escalation in militancy in KP, adjacent to Afghanistan, following the collapse of a tenuous truce between TTP and the state in Nov 2022.Pakistani authorities have linked the surge in militant violence to cross-border incursions from Afghanistan, alleging that the Kabul administration is facilitating TTP fighters, a claim Afghan authorities refute. Most of these assaults have been directed at security and law-enforcement personnel, although civilians and govt officials have also been impacted.In KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district last week, four soldiers were killed by gunfire and an improvised explosive device (IED) unleashed by terrorists.In Balochistan, another restive province in Pakistan’s south, 18 soldiers were killed in an attack by terrorists earlier this month.Islamabad think-tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) has described 2024 as the most lethal year for security forces in a decade, with a minimum of 685 military and police fatalities resulting from 444 terror attacks.Alongside such attacks, militants have stepped up targeted killings and kidnappings of officials in KP and Balochistan.","Nearly a dozen militants stormed a police check post at Karak district in Pakistan’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

ISLAMABAD : The UN refugees and migration agencies on Wednesday expressed their concern over Pakistan 's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting relocation to the United States and elsewhere.The UN refugee agency, UNHCR , and the international organization for migration in a statement said they were seeking clarification from Pakistan, which said last week it would deport the refugees back to Afghanistan unless their cases were processed quickly by the countries that had agreed to take them in.About 20,000 Afghans were approved for resettlement in the US under a program that helps people at risk because of their work with the American government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. They were among tens of thousands of Afghans who fled to neighboring Pakistan after their country fell to the Taliban in 2021.However, they were left in limbo after President Donald Trump paused US refugee programs last month.""A UNHCR-issued non-return advisory has been in place since 2021, calling for a suspension of forced returns of Afghan nationals from any country regardless of their status,"" the joint UNHCR-IOM statement said.Pakistan's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif last week gave the green light to evict Afghans without papers from the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi before March 31, in preparation for deportation if they were not relocated to their host countries.UNHCR and IOM said they are especially concerned for Afghan nationals who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, women and girls, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians and others.It said since January 1, 2025, an uptick in arrests of Afghan nationals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi has caused significant distress, with reports of Afghan nationals of various documentation statuses being rounded up.The Trump administration also announced the US refugee admissions program would be suspended from January 27 for at least three months. It has shocked Afghans who were hoping to travel to the United States soon.Afghans in Pakistan have been virtually living in hiding since 2023 when a crackdown began on foreigners who are in the country without proper documentation. An estimated 800,000 Afghans have either gone back voluntarily or been deported since despite criticism from UN agencies, rights groups and the Taliban.Besides thousands of Afghans who are living in Pakistan and awaiting travel to host countries, there are around 1.45 million Afghan nationals registered with UNHCR as refugees in Pakistan as well but their stay has been extended until June.In the statement, UNHCR and IOM urged ""Pakistan to implement any relocation measures with due consideration for human rights standards, including due process, and the legal status of proof of registration (POR) and afghan citizen card (ACC) holders, who have resided in Pakistan for an extended period of time"".""Pakistan has a proud tradition of hosting refugees, saving millions of lives.

Pakistan Media Claims Kabul Refused to Accept Body of Taliban Official's Son,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-media-claims-kabul-refuses-to-accept-body-of-afghan-officials-son/articleshow/117895393.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Afghan authorities have refused to receive the body of the son of a senior Afghan Taliban official who was killed, allegedly in a recent military offensive in Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province bordering Afghanistan, state media claimed on Monday.Citing sources, Radio Pakistan referred to an intelligence-based operation conducted in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district on Friday in which, the military claims, four terrorists were killed. “Among those killed was the son of the deputy governor (Maulvi Ghulam Muhammad Ahmadi, 55) of Baghdis province of Afghanistan. He was identified as Badaruddin, alias Yousaf,” it claimed, adding the Afghan authorities had refused to receive the body despite multiple requests from Pakistan.Radio Pakistan stated that US-made night vision equipment, along with M16A4 and M24 sniper rifles, were recovered from the terrorists who were killed.“Badaruddin was directly involved in the new wave of terrorist attacks from Afghanistan into Pakistan. The Afghan Taliban leadership still maintains close ties with terrorist organisations, including the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP),” the report said. It claimed that Badaruddin had previously received training at an Afghan Taliban training centre and later joined TTP.Pakistan alleges the Afghan govt harbours armed groups, particularly TTP, which conducts cross-border assaults against Pakistani security forces. Last month, Pakistan had repatriated the body of an Afghan national allegedly involved in terrorist activities in Zhob district of Balochistan province in the southwest. On that, the military’s media wing, had said the incident was “irrefutable evidence” of the involvement of Afghan nationals in terrorist activities in Pakistan.Kabul, however, denies providing shelter to armed groups or allowing the use of their territory for cross-border attacks.","The son of a senior Afghan Taliban official was killed, allegedly in a recent military offensive in Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province bordering Afghanistan.
