Tariff row: Trump lists India among nations 'harming US',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tariff-row-trump-lists-india-among-nations-harming-us/articleshow/117655823.cms,"PM Modi is coming to White House, probably in Feb, says Trump

WASHINGTON/NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump has said that PM Narendra Modi will do ""what is right"" on illegal immigrants, underlining that discussions are going on with India.Making these remarks on Monday while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his way back to Joint Base Andrews from Florida, Trump also mentioned that Modi is likely to visit the White House in Feb. Trump told House Republicans at a Florida retreat on Monday that the US would impose tariffs on countries that ""harm"" America, naming China, India and Brazil as high-tariff countries. ""We are going to put tariffs on outside countries and outside people that really mean harm to us. Look at what others do. China is a tremendous tariff maker, and India and Brazil and so many other countries. So, we're not going to let that happen any longer because we're going to put America first,"" he said.The remarks followed his phone conversation with Modi in which, as the White House said in a statement, Trump called upon India to increase its procurement of American-made security equipment and move towards a ""fair bilateral trading relationship"". The leaders discussed plans for PM Modi to visit the White House, underscoring the strength of friendship & strategic ties between our nations, said the White House.While talking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump was asked if Modi has agreed to take illegal immigrants. ""He (Modi) will do what's right. We are discussing,"" said the president.""I had a long talk with him this morning (Monday). He is going to be coming to the White House, over next month, probably Feb. We have a very good relationship with India,"" he told reporters. Responding to a question on the phone call he had with Modi on Monday, Trump told reporters, ""Everything came up (in a phone call with Modi)."" The PM's trip to the US, the first under Trump 2.0, was finalised during the call.""President Donald J Trump held a productive call with PM Modi . They discussed expanding and deepening cooperation. They also discussed a range of regional issues, including security in the Indo-Pacific, the Middle East and Europe,"" said White House readout.Both Modi and Trump emphasised their commitment to advance US-India strategic ties and the Indo-Pacific Quad partnership, with India set to host Quad representatives for the first time later this year. Like in many countries, there have been some concerns in India as well over the Trump administration's approach to immigration and tariffs. Trump has already talked about slapping ""100% tariffs"" on BRICS grouping, a bloc that includes India as well.During a weekly press briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal referred to India's ongoing dialogue with the US on matters related to trade and immigration and expressed hope that both sides will be able to address any issue. Trade occupies a special place within the strong and multi-faceted India-US relationship, and the two sides reached a record level of trade in goods and services worth $190 billion in 2023, Jaiswal said.","US President Donald Trump has said that PM Narendra Modi will do ""what is right"" on illegal immigrants.

The NIA said the suspects were involved in harbouring, sheltering and facilitating the terrorists who fatally shot the two civilians - Amritpal Singh and Rohit Masi - hailing from Chamyari in Amritsar, Punjab, on Feb 7, 2024, in Srinagar's Shaheed Ganj area.While Amritpal had died on the spot, Rohit succumbed to injuries at a Srinagar hospital.

NIA has already filed a chargesheet in the case, naming four accused. The NIA probe has so far revealed that masterminds of LeT and TRF were in touch with youth in the Kashmir Valley to orchestrate attacks on non-locals as part of a conspiracy to wage war against the Indian govt.

However, once they reached the spot and cleared the debris, they realised another life had been snuffed out.The collapse at Burari, which claimed five lives, has led the authorities to carry out one of the longest rescue operations, lasting more than 36 hours. Rescue efforts proved to be a daunting task for the two teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and others comprising about 100 firefighters, besides policemen and locals, who worked round-the-clock for over 18 hours.""This was a classic case of pancake collapse,"" a fire official said, explaining: ""When a building collapses, the upper floors crush onto the lower floors, creating a layered, pancake-like effect, with each floor stacked on top of the other.""""Unlike most rescue operations, where buildings are partially collapsed with manageable debris, this incident presented a unique challenge. There was a lot of debris, and removing it was a painstakingly slow process,"" he added.The rescue operation saw many bravehearts risking their lives. ASI Sudhir from Burari police station crawled through the debris, guided just by mobile flashlights and torches, and managed to pull out a survivor. He was helped by his team, including head constable Sandeep, Pardeep, Rahish and Sunil, who pulled out six victims.Dharmender, a resident, along with two of his friends, managed to save four people, including children. ""There was a narrow passage to enter the collapsed building, and there was a risk that the remaining structure could fall on me,"" he told TOI. ""I saw a girl crying... while trying to keep her calm, I slowly removed the debris and pulled her out. We then rescued three more people with help from others,"" he added.To search for those trapped deep inside, the NDRF personnel used special 'victim-locating cameras'. They also used two types of instruments - spade cutters and reciprocating saws - to cut through the debris and reach the survivors. Fire officials had to use gas and hydraulic cutters to retrieve the victims.""We first manually removed the debris and then used hydraulic cutters to cut the iron rods embedded in it, ensuring the safety of both firefighters and victims,"" said a fire official.Till Monday midnight, over a ton of debris was cleared and a dozen people were extracted. The congested lanes, however, proved to be a major obstacle for rescue and fire vehicles. ""We couldn't use multiple JCBs.

Michelle's absence from high-profile events is not because of her hatred for Trump



'Barack and Michelle have been at each other since Election Day like cats and dogs'



Amid rumors that former president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama are headed for a divorce, a Radar Online report claimed adding that their divorce will come later and quietly as they already separated and are in the process of mapping out their high-profile separation. The report cited a source close to the couple and said Barack is ready to move on and after years of sacrifice, Michelle Obama is also now putting herself first. ""She sacrificed so much for him over the years, and she's finally putting herself first,"" the report said.""They're already separated and living apart. Divorce will come later and quietly. For them to admit the failure is quite humiliating,"" the report said citing another anonymous source.The speculations over Barack-Michelle's separation started after Michelle Obama skipped two high-profile events. For Jimmy Carter's funeral, a scheduling conflict was cited and it was said that Michelle was on an extended vacation in Hawaii. For Donald Trump's inauguration, no reason was given. The Radar Online report quoted sources who said that Michelle Obama is not like that. She is the person who will always show up and play her role. ""Michelle's always been the type to show up and play the role, no matter what was going on behind the scenes,"" one said as quoted by the report.""She's no stranger to putting duty above her personal feelings, but not this time. This is a major signal that she's making changes and stepping away from the life she's been stuck in for decades,"" the report quoted another source.The report claimed that Barack Obama wanted Michelle to run for the president but she rejected as she was never interested in the DC life and now Barack has been blaming her for Trump's victory.""They've been at each other since Election Day like cats and dogs – truly venomous stuff. She's sacrificed for so many years and for him to ask that of her – to return to the maelstrom of D.C. after she served so dutifully for so long, is totally unfair and unreasonable. And then to blame her for the Republican landslide is akin to twisting the knife. It really is beyond the pale. Yes, she probably would have won if she had run but she simply does not share the ambition and hunger for power and believes that after her prior service, enough is enough,"" another unnamed source was cited by the report.The source added: ""It's been heated and tense and uncomfortable, and in a lot of ways, it was the last straw for her in the marriage.""The divorce speculation triggered rumors of Barack Obama dating actor Jennifer Aniston which was reported by a magazine last year but at that time Jen dismissed the rumors.","A Radar Online report claims that former president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama are headed for a divorce.

Prosecutors in Rome have initiated a probe targeting Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and two cabinet ministers regarding the deportation of a Libyan warlord sought by the International Criminal Court in the Hague, as announced by the premier on Tuesday. In a social media video, Meloni disclosed the investigation concerning alleged assistance to Ossama Anjiem , also referred to as Ossama al-Masri .She indicated that her justice and interior ministers, along with an under-secretary, are also subjects of the investigation. The Meloni administration has faced criticism from opposition parties, human rights organisations, and the ICC following al-Masri's release on procedural grounds after his arrest in Turin on an international court warrant.The investigation is centred around Osama Najim, also known as Almasri, the chief of Libya’s judicial police and head of the controversial Mitiga prison, who was arrested in Turin, Italy, on an ICC warrant for alleged war crimes, crimes against humanity, rape, and murder. However, he was released and returned to Libya due to ""procedural technicality"". The ICC announced on Wednesday that Najim had been freed from detention and sent back to Libya, ""without prior notice or consultation with the court"", as reported by Guardian News.His release has drawn sharp criticism from opposition parties and human rights advocates, who accuse the Italian government of undermining justice and prioritizing political interests with Libya.

In the larger public interest, all Akharas have agreed not to go for the Snan today.”Sources said the Mela administration is in talks with ABAP regarding the Snan. Earlier, Puri had said, ""We are deeply saddened by what happened at Sangam Nose. This is an act of sacrifice from our side as we had been eagerly waiting for this rare occasion after 144 years.

Devotees should take the dip at the nearest ghat instead of insisting on reaching the Sangam.”Acharya Mahamandelshwar of Anand Akhara, Balakanand Puri, echoed similar sentiments, emphasizing that the entire Kumbh Mela area holds the same spiritual significance as Sangam.Famous storyteller Devkinandan Thakur also urged devotees to avoid congestion and take a dip at the nearest ghat.A strong police presence, including paramilitary forces, has been deployed at entry and exit points near the Sangam to regulate the crowd.Maha Kumbh Mela District Magistrate Vijay Kiran Anand has been patrolling the area to ensure the safety of devotees.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been closely monitoring the situation at the Mahakumbh and remains in constant communication with Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath.Having spoken with the CM three times so far, Modi has called for immediate support measures and provided directions for the swift normalization of the situation, while ensuring timely relief efforts for those affected.Union home minister Amit Shah also spoke to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath following a stampede-like situation at the Sangam during the Mauni Amavasya celebrations at the Maha Kumbh Mela.

The next major bathing event will take place on Basant Panchami (February 3), which is also the third Amrit Snan.According to the Uttar Pradesh government’s schedule, various Akharas had planned to begin their procession as early as 4am, with each group allocated a set duration for the ceremonial bath.Authorities have deployed police personnel at seven static points along the corridor route to regulate the flow of devotees during the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj.The ""Super 20"" team, assigned to manage the crowd at ghats, is appealing to pilgrims to vacate the area after taking their holy dip.Senior seers of Juna, Agni, and Aawahan Akharas have decided to return to their camps and take their holy dip later in the day at the nearest ghat.The administration has set up temporary ghats along a 12-km stretch of the Ganga to accommodate the large number of devotees.Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Avdeshanand Giri of Juna Akhara, along with Baba Ramdev and BJP MP from Mathura Hema Malini, took a holy dip at the nearest available ghat.The Acharya arrived without a grand procession, performed puja at the riverbank, and offered a saree to Maa Ganga.A government spokesperson clarified that the Akharas have not canceled their Snan but have postponed their holy dip for later in the day.Acharya Mahamandaleshwar of Juna Akhara stated that the akhara will not hold a procession and will instead take a symbolic Snan.President of Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad, Ravindra Puri, stated, ""As soon as the crowd of devotees reduces and there is space for us, the Akharas will proceed with the Amrit Snan.""Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad president Mahant Ravindra Puri said, ""We are seeing that the crowd is decreasing now, and we are holding discussions with the Mela administration. We would like to take the 'snan' if the crowd decreases. We had postponed the 'snan' in the morning. We are also trying to ensure that the situation normalises, after which we will coordinate with the Mela administration and proceed with the 'snan'.""ABVP President Ravindra Puri stated that the Akharas will proceed for the Amrit Snan after 10am, but only after assessing the situation regarding the number of devotees at the Sangam Nose.Spiritual leader Devkinandan Thakur has appealed for calm following reports of a stampede-like situation at Sangam during the Mauni Amavasya celebrations.""I just returned after taking a dip in the Ganga, and I received a message about a stampede at Sangam. I request everyone to remain calm, as Sangam is extremely crowded right now. I chose to bathe in the Ganga instead of Sangam for this reason, and I still received the same spiritual benefits. Please do not believe in rumors, as authorities are handling the situation. I urge people not to take elderly and children to Sangam at this moment,"" he said.After conducting a 'shanti puja' for those affected by the stampede, Parmarth Niketan Head Chidanand Saraswati Maharaj spoke about the incident, emphasizing the importance of safety in such moments. He said, ""We have cancelled all the planned programmes and advised the people that at this time, the only worship is to pray for those affected by the stampede, wherever they are.

A man in North Carolina, US, has been charged with multiple crimes after allegedly breaking into a motel near Raleigh while pretending to be a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent,reported. He is accused of threatening a woman with deportation if she did not engage in sexual acts with him.The accused, Carl Thomas Bennett, Jr, 37, was arrested on Sunday. According to the arrest warrant, he used a fake business card with a badge and ""threatened to deport the victim if she did not have sex with him.""Bennett faces nine charges, including breaking and entering, possession of cocaine, kidnapping, rape, and impersonating law enforcement. He appeared in court on Monday, where his request for release was denied. He is currently held at the Wake County Detention Center and has been ordered to appear in court again in February. Court records show he has prior charges from February and June 2024 for alleged trespassing offenses.In the US, cases of individuals posing as immigration officers have been reported earlier too. Nikki Barin Baena, from the local immigrant advocacy group Siembra NC, said the allegations highlight concerns about exploitation in the current environment.""This is kind of a perfect storm what’s happening right now and it’s opening up opportunities for people who are not doing any kind of law enforcement to take advantage of people in terrible ways,"" Baena was quoted as saying by WRAL News.She added, ""People wouldn’t be surprised that an ICE agent acted in an inappropriate way because they often do act in inappropriate ways to get information out of people.""This incident follows another case last week in the US state of Missouri, where a man was charged with burglary, harassment, assault, and impersonating law enforcement. He allegedly broke into a home, demanded to see immigration documents, and threatened to use a gun.According, communities across the US have reported increasing fear and anxiety as immigration officials carry out mass deportations under the Trump administration.Concerns have also been raised about ICE itself. A 2023 PBS investigation found that hundreds of immigrants have reported sexual abuse in ICE detention facilities, with most cases not being investigated. Civil rights groups have also criticized ICE for allegedly impersonating police officers during immigration raids, arguing that it creates confusion and fear among migrants.","A man in North Carolina, US, has been charged with multiple crimes after allegedly breaking into a motel while pretending to be a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent.

Trump invites Israel's Netanyahu to meet with him at the White House next week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-invites-israels-netanyahu-to-meet-with-him-at-the-white-house-next-week/articleshow/117664739.cms,"Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu (File photo)

WADI GAZA: President Donald Trump has invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House next week as the first foreign leader to visit in Trump's second term, Netanhayu and the White House said Tuesday.The announcement came as the United States pressures Israel and Hamas to continue a ceasefire that has paused a devastating 15-month war in Gaza. Talks about the ceasefire's more difficult second phase, which aims to end the war, begin next Monday.The White House letter shared by Netanyahu's office, dated Tuesday, said ""I look forward to discussing how we can bring peace to Israel and its neighbors, and efforts to counter our shared adversaries.""The meeting on February 4 is a chance for Netanyahu, under pressure at home, to remind the world of the support he has received from Trump over the years, and to defend Israel's conduct of the war. Last year, the two men met face-to-face for the first time in nearly four years at Trump's Florida Mar-a-Lago estate.Israel is the largest recipient of US military aid, and Netanyahu is likely to encourage Trump not to hold up some weapons deliveries the way the Biden administration did, though it continued other deliveries and overall military support.Netanyahu also wants Trump to put more pressure on Iran, and renew efforts to deliver a historic normalization agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a rival of Iran and the Arab world's most powerful country.Even before taking office this month, Trump was sending his special Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to the region to apply pressure along with the Biden administration to get the current Gaza ceasefire achieved.But Netanyahu has vowed to renew the war if Hamas doesn't meet his demands in negotiations over the ceasefire's second phase, meant to discuss a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a ""sustainable calm.""Over 375,000 return to northern Gaza Under the deal, more than 375,000 Palestinians have crossed into northern Gaza since Israel allowed their return on Monday morning, the United Nations said Tuesday. That represents over a third of the million people who fled in the war's opening days.Many of the Palestinians trudging along a seaside road or crossing in vehicles after security inspections were getting their first view of shattered northern Gaza under the fragile ceasefire, now in its second week.Trump this week suggested that Egypt and Jordan take in Palestinians from Gaza, at least temporarily, so that ""we just clean out that whole thing"" - which Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians swiftly rejected, fearing Israel would never allow a return.Instead, Palestinians were determined to pitch makeshift shelters or sleep outdoors amid the vast piles of broken concrete or perilously leaning buildings. After months of crowding in squalid tent camps or former schools in Gaza's south, they would finally be home.""It's still better for us to be on our land than to live on a land that's not yours,"" said Fayza al-Nahal as she prepared to leave the southern city of Khan Younis for the north.At least two Palestinians set off for the north by sea, crowding into a rowboat with a bicycle and other belongings.Hani Al-Shanti, displaced from Gaza City, looked forward to feeling at peace in whatever he found, ""even if it is a roof and walls without furniture, even if it is without a roof."" One newly returned woman hung laundry in the ruins of her home, its walls blown out.Next steps Under the ceasefire, the next release of hostages held in Gaza, and Palestinian prisoners from Israeli custody, is set to occur on Thursday, followed by another exchange on Saturday.In the ceasefire's six-week first phase, a total of 33 hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, that ignited the war should be released, along with almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.Israel this week said a list provided by Hamas confirmed the fears that eight of the 33 hostages to be freed are dead, bringing fresh grief to Israeli families who have long pressed the government to reach a deal to bring everyone home before time runs out.On Tuesday, one of the first hostages to be released under the current ceasefire - just the second in the war - shared a glimpse of life in captivity.Naama Levy, 20, wrote on social media that she spent most of the first 50 days alone before being reunited with other soldiers kidnapped from her military base on October 7, well as other civilian captives.""We strengthened each other until the day of our release, and also afterwards,"" she wrote.Aid flows in A surge in humanitarian aid into Gaza continued under the ceasefire.""In this past week alone, approximately 4,200 trucks carrying aid have entered the Gaza Strip following inspections,"" said Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel.Under the deal, 600 trucks of aid are meant to enter per day.The government of Qatar, a mediator in the ceasefire talks, said Tuesday that while complaints have been raised by both sides, no confirmed ceasefire violations have occurred that could cause the agreement to collapse.The ceasefire is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas. Militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the October 7 assault and abducted another 250.Israel responded with an air and ground offensive that has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, over half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.","President Donald Trump invites Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House next week.

In her debut press briefing on Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the Trump administration 's decision to end birthright citizenship , calling it ""unconstitutional"".The executive order, signed by President Donald Trump shortly after taking office, denies automatic citizenship to children of migrants who are in the US illegally or on temporary visas. It applies to births from February 19 onward and does not apply retroactively.Leavitt, the youngest press secretary in US history, responded to legal challenges from 22 state attorneys general by reaffirming the administration’s stance. ""This administration believes that birthright citizenship is unconstitutional,"" she said, pledging to take the issue to the Supreme Court The press briefing also highlighted the administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement efforts. Leavitt warned potential border-crossers to “think again” as she detailed recent ICE operations .“The 3,500 arrests that ICE has made so far since President Trump came back into office,” she said, pointing out that all detainees are considered criminals.When asked about those without violent offenses, she doubled down: “All of them, because they illegally broke our nation's laws, and therefore, they are criminals as far as this administration goes.”Leavitt also addressed economic policy, confirming that tariffs on Canada remain on schedule for February 1, with additional duties on Mexico and China under consideration. “I spoke with the president Monday night, and he indicated February 1 was ‘still on the books’ for the introduction of damaging duties,” she stated.The administration also plans to impose tariffs on foreign-made semiconductors , computer chips, and pharmaceuticals to encourage domestic manufacturing.","White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt is the youngest press secretary in US history.

'Well-educated': Donald Trump's 'border czar' Tom Homan criticises migrants' knowledge of rights during ICE operations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/well-educated-donald-trumps-border-czar-tom-homan-criticises-migrants-knowledge-of-rights-during-ice-operations/articleshow/117661501.cms,"File photo: Tom Homan (Picture credit: ANI)

Tom Homan , US President Donald Trump’s “border czar” and former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), expressed frustration over the challenges ICE agents face in sanctuary cities due to immigrants being ""well-educated"" about their rights.Speaking on American news network CNN, Homan complained that initiatives like Chicago's ""Know Your Rights"" campaign hinder ICE's ability to arrest undocumented immigrants .“For instance, Chicago—very well-educated,“ Homan continued. ”They‘ve been educated on how to how to defy ICE, how to hide from ICE. I‘ve seen many pamphlets from many NGOs: ’Here‘s how you escape ICE from arresting you. Here‘s what you need to do.’""“They call it ‘Know Your Rights.’ I call it ‘how to escape arrest,’” Homan added.Despite these challenges, Homan remained resolute. ""If we gotta play that cat and mouse game, that’s what we’re going to do ‘til every one of them’s gone,” he said.Under Trump's renewed immigration policies, ICE operations have ramped up in major cities, including Chicago, Miami, and Newark. According to NBC News, ICE has arrested over 4,800 individuals since Trump returned to office, with the administration promising even more aggressive measures in the coming weeks.Concerns have been raised about ICE's activities in sensitive locations such as schools, with Homan justifying such operations by citing public safety and national security threats. Critics argue that targeting educational institutions spreads fear among students and undermines trust in local communities.In an appearance on Megyn Kelly ’s YouTube show, Homan entertained the idea of offering financial incentives for immigrants to ""self-deport."" Kelly suggested providing a financial payout to encourage voluntary departures, a proposal Homan said was under consideration but did not elaborate on.The heightened deportation measures have sparked outrage, with celebrities like Selena Gomez publicly condemning the administration’s actions. Gomez, whose family has Mexican roots, posted an emotional message on Instagram, expressing sorrow for the affected families. Though the posts were later deleted, her words highlighted the human cost of the intensified ICE operations.Homan dismissed criticisms, including from public figures, stating on Fox News: “If they don’t like it, they should go to Congress and change the law. We’re going to do this operation without apology.”","Tom Homan, former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), expressed frustration over the challenges ICE agents face in sanctuary cities.

A passenger plane’s tail caught fire at Gimhae International Airport in South Korea on Tuesday night, prompting the evacuation of all 176 people on board, including 169 passengers and seven crew members.All were safely evacuated, with three individuals sustaining injuries, but their condition was non-serious, according to Yonhap News Agency.The Air Busan flight, which was preparing for departure to Hong Kong from the southeastern city of Busan, faced the incident before takeoff, at around 10:15 pm local time (1315 GMT), the ministry of transport said in a statement. No information on the cause of the fire was given. The fire has been completely extinguished.This event comes weeks after a fatal crash involving a Jeju Air passenger plane at Muan International Airport in southern South Korea that resulted in 181 fatalities. On December 29, a Boeing 737-800 skidded off the runway after its landing gear failed to deploy, crashing into a concrete structure and bursting into flames. The victims were primarily South Korean nationals, with two Thai nationals among the deceased. An investigation report released Monday said there were traces of bird strikes in the engine of the aircraft.","A passenger plane’s tail caught fire at Gimhae International Airport in South Korea on Tuesday night.

Poll Should Countries Accept Their Illegal Immigrants? No, It Should Be Negotiated Yes, It Is Their Responsibility

Ruby Dhalla , a candidate for Liberal Party leadership and potential prime ministerial position in Canada, made a firm statement on Tuesday regarding her stance on illegal immigration, promising deportation if elected.On the social media platform X, Dhalla stated, ""As Prime Minister, I will deport illegal immigrants and clamp down on human traffickers. That's my promise to you.""Dhalla, an Indian-origin former MP, represented the now-defunct riding of Brampton-Springdale from 2004 to 2011.

Tamil-Telugu Unity: Can JD Vance's team help make Vivek Ramaswamy the Governor of Ohio?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tamil-telugu-unity-can-jd-vances-team-help-make-vivek-ramaswamy-the-governor-of-ohio/articleshow/117637596.cms,"sambhar (a sour lentli-based stew).

A Yale Connection with Political Consequences



18-Year-Old Vivek Ramaswamy Takes Over the Graduation Stage, Demonstrating His Alpha Male Skills

Vivek's Avengers Assemble



Navigating a Crowded Field



The Fallout from DOGE



JD Vance’s Role



The Usha Factor



Challenges Ahead



There’s a running joke in desi circles that the Telugu vs Tamil fight was settled once and for all when the Trump-Vance ticket trumped Harris-Walz in the 2024 US Presidential election race. The received wisdom went that Harris, whose mother was Tamil, was trumped by the ""Hillbily"" JD Vance, who has become so by virtue of his marriage to Usha an honorary Telugu.For those not familiar with the dynamics, the Telugu-Tamil battle is as old as the time when the two states were both part of the Madras Presidency before being divided into two states ( Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh ) along linguistic lines. The Tamil-Telugu rivalry continues in all aspects, including cinema, the true origin of grandmaster Gukesh (is he a Tamilian because he learnt his chess in Chennai?) and who makes betterOf course, all that’s a joke because the two big representatives in the MAGA camp – Vivek Ramaswamy , whose parents came from Andhra Pradesh, and JD and Usha Vance – get along rather well and are buddies from their Yale days. In fact, in what will be a rare win for Vivek, who has only garnered negative headlines recently, the former presidential candidate is bringing on board JD Vance’s top operatives to launch his gubernatorial campaign in Ohio.Vivek Ramaswamy and JD Vance first crossed paths at Yale Law School, where they built a friendship rooted in mutual respect and shared ambitions.Both men emerged as unconventional conservatives, leveraging their outsider status to carve significant political and cultural influence. Vance’s journey from bestselling author of Hillbilly Elegy to Vice President of the US reflects his ability to connect with working-class voters. Ramaswamy , on the other hand, has made waves with his unapologetic defence of free-market principles, his critiques of “woke” culture, and his emphasis on intellectual achievement.Their partnership has now extended into the political arena, with Vance lending his top advisers to Ramaswamy’s campaign. The move underscores a shared vision for Ohio’s future and a broader strategy to solidify their influence within the Republican Party.Ramaswamy’s campaign team reads like a who’s who of Republican political operatives. Andy Surabian and Jai Chabria, who played pivotal roles in Vance’s Senate and vice-presidential campaigns, have joined the effort. Chabria, a seasoned Ohio strategist, will serve as the campaign’s general consultant. Surabian, a veteran of Trump’s earlier races, will oversee an outside political organisation aligned with Ramaswamy.The team also includes Tony Fabrizio, the pollster who contributed to Vance’s successful 2022 Senate bid and has worked on several Trump campaigns. Arthur Schwartz, a close ally of both Vance and Donald Trump Jr., is also on board. Additionally, veterans from Ramaswamy’s 2024 presidential run – Ben Yoho, Michael Biundo, and Chris Grant – will play significant roles in the campaign.These hirings reflect a strategic alignment between Ramaswamy and the broader Republican establishment. With advisers who have proven their mettle in high-stakes campaigns, Ramaswamy is well-positioned to navigate what is expected to be a competitive primary to replace term-limited Republican Governor Mike DeWine in 2026.Ramaswamy’s path to the governor’s mansion is far from guaranteed. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost has already declared his candidacy, tapping Justin Clark, a veteran of Trump’s campaigns, as his general consultant. State Treasurer Robert Sprague is also expected to enter the race soon. Both candidates have strong ties to Ohio’s political machinery, posing formidable challenges to Ramaswamy’s outsider bid.However, Ramaswamy’s national profile and ties to influential figures like Vance and Trump give him a unique edge. His ability to articulate a vision that resonates with Ohio voters while leveraging his connections to the MAGA movement will be critical to his success.Ramaswamy’s campaign comes on the heels of his departure from the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where he served briefly before parting ways. His exit has been the subject of intense speculation, with some pointing to his controversial comments on immigration and academic excellence as contributing factors.In December, Ramaswamy sparked a firestorm with a tweet criticising what he described as America’s “cultural veneration of mediocrity.” He argued that the US had deprioritised academic excellence in favour of social conformity, suggesting this cultural failing was why top tech companies often hired foreign-born engineers over native-born Americans. The tweet polarised audiences, earning praise from some for its boldness while drawing criticism from others who accused him of elitism and undermining American workers.The controversy reportedly exacerbated tensions with Elon Musk, a key figure within DOGE and a close adviser to Trump. Sources suggest Musk viewed Ramaswamy’s gubernatorial ambitions as a distraction from DOGE’s mission to streamline federal bureaucracy, ultimately leading to his ouster.For JD Vance, supporting Ramaswamy’s bid is both a strategic and personal decision. As Vice President, Vance’s influence within the Republican Party has grown significantly, and his endorsement carries considerable weight. By aligning his team with Ramaswamy, Vance is flexing his political muscle and signalling his confidence in their shared vision for conservative governance.Vance’s involvement also reflects a broader effort to build a coalition of like-minded leaders who can advance the America First agenda. With his deep roots in Ohio and his close relationship with Ramaswamy, Vance’s support could prove decisive in shaping the outcome of the gubernatorial race.Another dimension of the Ramaswamy-Vance alliance is their shared connection to Usha Vance, JD Vance’s wife. A practising Hindu, Usha has faced both admiration and criticism within the MAGA movement, which often grapples with questions of inclusivity and multiculturalism. Her presence at Vance’s side has helped normalise non-Christian identities within a movement that has historically emphasised Christian nationalism.For Ramaswamy, who is unapologetically Hindu, this shared cultural identity underscores the complexities of navigating a movement that often views multiculturalism with suspicion. While his faith sets him apart from many in the Republican base, it also positions him as a symbol of the movement’s potential to broaden its appeal.As Ramaswamy prepares to launch his campaign, he faces a series of challenges that will test his political acumen and resilience. His polarising views on immigration, education, and cultural values will undoubtedly attract scrutiny from both opponents and allies. Additionally, his brief tenure at DOGE and his subsequent departure could become a focal point for critics seeking to question his commitment to the MAGA agenda.However, Ramaswamy’s strengths lie in his ability to articulate a compelling vision and connect with voters on issues that resonate deeply with them. His emphasis on intellectual achievement, free-market principles, and government efficiency aligns closely with the priorities of many conservative voters. By leveraging his national profile and the support of key figures like JD Vance, he has a strong foundation from which to build his campaign.",Vivek Ramaswamy and JD Vance first crossed paths at Yale Law School.

Moving to Substack

Jim Acosta , the veteran CNN anchor and former White House correspondent , has departed the network after nearly two decades. Announcing his resignation during his final broadcast, Acosta said he decided to leave rather than accept a shift to a midnight-to-2 am time slot, part of CNN’s recent programming reshuffle.Hours later, Acosta revealed his next move, launching an independent platform on Substack .During his last broadcast on CNN, Acosta delivered a pointed message, seemingly aimed at his longtime adversary, Donald Trump . “Don’t give in to the lies. Don’t give in to the fear. Hold on to the truth and hope,” he told viewers. Reflecting on his career, Acosta highlighted his coverage of former President Barack Obama’s 2016 visit to Cuba, where he interviewed Raul Castro, as a personal and professional milestone. He called it a lesson in resilience, stating, “It is never a good time to bow down to a tyrant.”As per The New York Post, Acosta, who is of Cuban descent , connected his experience to his commitment to holding power to account.Acosta announced his new venture via a video on X (formerly Twitter) shortly after leaving CNN. “I’m going independent, at least for now,” he said in the video, which introduced his new Substack platform, The Jim Acosta Show. He plans to use the platform to discuss politics and current events while fostering thoughtful conversations about pressing issues.According to The Wrap, Acosta joins a growing list of prominent journalists, such as Taylor Lorenz and Matt Taibbi, who have transitioned to Substack to pursue independent journalism . In his introductory message on the platform, Acosta reiterated his farewell message: “Do not give in to the lies. Do not give in to fear. Hold on to the truth, and hope.”Donald Trump, a frequent critic of Acosta during his presidency, reacted to the news of his departure with a scathing post on Truth Social, labelling Acosta a “major loser” and celebrating his exit as “good news.”However, Acosta replied to Trump’s post on social media platform X and wrote, “ Looks like somebody has ADS: Acosta Derangement Syndrome”.Earlier, CNN offered a gracious statement and praised Acosta for his commitment to journalistic freedoms, stating, “Jim has had a long, distinguished nearly 20-year career at CNN, with a track record of standing up to authority... We want to thank him for the dedication and commitment he’s brought to his reporting and wish him the very best in the future.”","Jim Acosta announces independent venture after leaving CNN, reacts to Trump’s ‘major loser’ comment.

RFK Jr is addicted to attention and power and discouraged parents from vaccinating their children while he innoculated his own children, the cousin said.“I have known Bobby my whole life; we grew up together,” wrote Kennedy. “It’s no surprise that he keeps birds of prey as pets because he himself is a predator.""“His basement, his garage, his dorm room were the centers of the action where drugs were available, and he enjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks.

Pence’s group, Advancing American Freedom, released a 57-second advertisement a day before Kennedy’s hearing begins, compiling Trump’s past criticisms of Kennedy, including the now-president calling Kennedy an “extreme liberal” and saying “don’t think you’re going to vote for him and feel good ... I’d even take [Joe] Biden over Junior.”","Caroline Kennedy wrote a letter to the senators ahead of his confirmation as the health secretary calling him a predator whose victims ranged from family members to the parents of sick children.

Baloch leader calls for solidarity against Pakistan's brutal oppression,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/baloch-leader-calls-for-solidarity-against-pakistans-brutal-oppression/articleshow/117628431.cms,"<p>Baloch leader Hyrbyair Marri (Image credits: ANI)<br></p>

LONDON: Baloch leader Hyrbyair Marri brought attention to the ongoing horrors that the Pashtun and Baloch communities endure under Pakistan 's repressive control in a stirring statement to the Pashtun National Council (Jirga). Marri brought attention to the Pakiststate's systematic exploitation, enforced disappearances, and violence against various ethnic communities.""The sufferings of the Baloch and Pashtun under Pakistan's occupation are countless and unending,"" Marri stated, emphasizing the urgent need for unity between the two nations to resist colonial oppression.He recalled previous instances of solidarity, such as the treaty of kalat in 1758, in which Afghan and Baloch leaders promised to respect and support one another. He asked both groups to rekindle this spirit in their struggle for independence.Marri compared British imperialism to the colonial strategies that Pakistan acquired. He denounced Pakistan's continuous military actions in Balochistan , pointing to unlawful executions, torture, and enforced disappearances as means of quelling dissent. The Baloch leader cited the targeted profiling of Pashtuns and killings like the 1948 Barbra event in Charsadda, claiming that these practices were continuations of the British heritage of divide and conquer.Recalling how Pashtun tribes were utilized as frontline combatants in 1948 while Punjabi elites remained behind, he also denounced Pakistan's abuse of Baloch and Pashtun youth. He also drew attention to the fact that thousands of Baloch youths were forcibly drafted into the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and sent to die under pretences of religious salvation.Marri condemned Pakistan's racial profiling of Afghan refugees, primarily Pashtuns, and their forced deportation as a pressure tactic against Afghanistan. ""These people have lived here for generations, yet they are treated as disposable,"" he said.Calling for a renewed alliance between the Baloch and Pashtun nations, Marri declared, ""Our unity is the path to freedom. Together, we will break the chains of occupation and build a future rooted in justice, sovereignty, and peace.""","Baloch leader Hyrbyair Marri spoke to the Pashtun National Council (Jirga) Marri condemned Pakistan's systematic exploitation, enforced disappearances, and violence against various ethnic communities.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan criminalised online disinformation on Tuesday, passing legislation that enshrines punishments of up to three years in prison, a decision journalists say is designed to crack down on dissent.The law targets anyone who ""intentionally disseminates"" information online that they have ""reason to believe to be false or fake and likely to cause or create a sense of fear, panic or disorder or unrest"".The law was rushed through the national assembly with little warning last week before being approved by the senate on Tuesday as journalists walked out of the gallery in protest.Senior journalist Asif Bashir Chaudhry, a member of the Pakistan federal union of journalists , told AFP the government had assured reporters they would be consulted but said they were ""betrayed and backstabbed"".""We genuinely wanted a law against misinformation, but if it's not being done through open discussion but rather through fear and coercion, we will challenge it on every available platform,"" Chaudhry said.""Even under dictatorships, legislation was not forcefully rammed through parliament the way this government is doing now.""The bill will now be passed to the president to be rubber-stamped.Analysts say the government is struggling with legitimacy after an election plagued with rigging allegations and with Pakistan's most popular politician, former prime minister Imran Khan , in jail on a slew of corruption charges his party says are politically motivated.Khan's supporters and senior leaders have also faced a severe crackdown, with thousands rounded up.Social media site X has been shut down in the wake of elections last February, as posts alleging vote tampering spread on the platform.Khan's name is censored from television and editors have reported increasing monitoring of their programming.Senator Syed Shibli Faraz, a member of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, called the new law ""highly undemocratic"" and said it would ""fuel the political victimisation"" of their activists.However, government minister Tanveer Hussain said that the bill would focus on policing social media.""I am sure that in the future, the anarchy caused in society through social media will be controlled,"" he said.There has been a proliferation of ""disinformation"" laws, including criminal legislation, worldwide in the past decade enabling governments to control speech online and police ""fake news"", according to human rights organisation Article 19 .Such laws can impede journalism, according to the group, which promotes freedom of expression and information globally.","Law targets anyone who ""intentionally disseminates"" information online that they have ""reason to believe to be false or fake"" Law rushed through national assembly with little warning before being approved by the senate.

Pakistan: Four Men Sentenced to Death in Pakistan on Blasphemy Charges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/four-men-sentenced-to-death-in-pakistan-on-blasphemy-charges/articleshow/117611779.cms,"ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani court has sentenced four men to death on blasphemy charges in the garrison city of Rawalpindi for allegedly uploading sacrilegious content about the Quran and Islamic figures.Tariq Ayub, a judge who awarded the sentence, said the contempt of figures sacred to Muslims and insulting the Quran were unforgivable offences that don’t deserve mercy. He sentenced the four men to death and also fined them 4.6 million Pakistani rupees (approximately $16,000). They were identified as Rana Usman, Ashfaque Ali, Salman Sajjad, and Wajid Ali.According to the court order, dated Jan 24, the four individuals were sentenced to death by hanging for using derogatory remarks against the Holy Prophet. They were also sentenced to life in prison for defiling the Holy Quran and to 10 years’ imprisonment for deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs. “All the sentences shall run concurrently,” the order read.The prosecution lawyer said the case was supported by forensic evidence from the devices used. The men’s lawyer, Manzoor Rahmani, criticised the court’s order, saying doubts and uncertainties that arise in such cases are ignored by the courts, likely due to fear of a religious backlash and potential mob violence against the judge if the accused is acquitted.“We are preparing our appeals against the decision and will go to the high court,” Rahmani said. A member of a support group formed by the families of the accused was quoted by media as saying the pattern of arrests and prosecutions in this case was consistent with previous ones.“We urge the government to establish a commission to investigate the rise in these cases before these young individuals spend the best years of their lives behind bars,” said the support group member.Critics say blasphemy accusations, whether true or false, often lead to lengthy prison sentences on death row and solitary confinement. The laws, according to them, are often abused to settle scores or used to target members of Pakistan’s religious minorities.Hundreds of people have been accused of blasphemy since the draconian laws were introduced by former dictator Gen Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan jailed former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi , on Monday challenged in a high court their conviction in the Al-Qadir Trust case .

A Pakistani court on Monday awarded death penalty to four men for ""online blasphemy"" against the Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book Quran.The four were charged with spreading blasphemous content online against Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book.""They were sentenced to death... on Friday for spreading blasphemous content online against the Prophet Mohammed and the Quran,"" Rao Abdur Raheem, a lawyer from the legal commission on blasphemy Pakistan, a private group which brought the case to court, told news agency AFP.""Our case was supported by forensic evidence from the devices used in this heinous act,"" he added.The four men were sentenced in Rawalpindi, the garrison city that neighbours the capital Islamabad.A member of a support group formed by the families, however, said to AFP that they would challenge the conviction.""The pattern of arrests and prosecutions in this case is consistent with previous ones,"" said the support group member, who spoke on condition of anonymity told the news agency.""We urge the government to establish a commission to investigate the rise in these cases before these young individuals spend the best years of their lives behind bars,"" the member added.Blasphemy laws in Pakistan are among the strictest in the world, carrying severe punishments, including the death penalty, for offences against Islam.These laws, primarily enshrined in Sections 295-298 of the Pakistan Penal Code, criminalise acts such as insulting the Prophet Muhammad, desecrating the Quran, or offending religious sentiments.These laws have often been criticised for being misused to target minorities, settle personal disputes, and incite mob violence. The lack of safeguards against false accusations has led to numerous cases where individuals face imprisonment, violence, or even extrajudicial killings without substantial evidence.The blasphemy laws have sparked national and international debates about human rights and freedom of expression in Pakistan.Activists argue that these laws suppress religious minorities, limit free speech, and create a climate of fear, while conservative groups strongly defend them as essential to protecting Islam.High-profile cases, such as those of Asia Bibi and Salman Taseer, have highlighted the deep divisions in Pakistani society regarding these laws. Successive governments have been reluctant to amend or repeal the legislation due to the risk of backlash from religious hardliners. As a result, blasphemy remains a highly sensitive issue, with calls for legal reforms often met with strong resistance.","Pakistani court awards death penalty to four men for ""online blasphemy"" against the Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book Quran.
