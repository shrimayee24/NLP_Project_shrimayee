Nagpur violence pre-planned; anger against Aurangzeb coming out after B'wood film: CM Fadnavis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nagpur-violence-pre-planned-anger-against-aurangzeb-coming-out-after-bwood-film-cm-fadnavis/articleshow/119185660.cms,"MUMBAI: Unrest in Nagpur in wake of demonstrations for removal of Aurangzeb's tomb resonated in both the Houses of Maharashtra legislature with CM Devendra Fadnavis terming the violence pre-planned while his deputy Eknath Shinde accused Sena UBT of abandoning the ideals of Balasaheb Thackeray and giving up Hindutva ideology by joining hands with Congress.Fadnavis, who holds home portfolio and hails from Nagpur, told the assembly: ""There were protests in the morning and then there was peace. But in the evening, there was a pre-planned attack in which select homes and establishments were targeted. A trolley of stones was found. Weapons were also recovered.""The CM said 33 cops including three deputy commissioners of police, one of whom was assaulted with an axe, were injured in the violence. ""We will take strong action against those involved. Attacks on police will not be tolerated.""Fadnavis said around 11.30am Monday, VHP and Bajrang Dal held a protest in Mahal area demanding removal of Aurangzeb's tomb. They burnt a grass replica of the tomb. However, a rumour spread in the evening that the replica which was burnt had a cloth cover with a religious text on it. This led to a mob of around 200-250 people gathering after namaz at Attar Road. They raised slogans and police had to use force to control them.While another 200-300 people, with their faces covered and carrying sticks, gathered in Hansapuri area and started throwing stones, the third incident occurred at Baldapura at 7.30pm, the CM said. A group of 80-100 people gathered and attacked cops. He spoke about the film 'Chhaava', which portrays the conflict between Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj & Aurangzeb. ""I'm not blaming any film, but it has fanned sentiments among people and their anger against Aurangzeb is coming out. I appeal to all to maintain calm and respect religious spaces.""While making a statement in the council on the violence, Shinde trained his guns on Sena UBT, saying: ""There was a plan (during MVA regime) to arrest BJP's Girish Mahajan, Ashish Shelar, Pravin Darekar and Fadnavis. I overturned the gameplan and brought Mahayuti to power. You became helpless in your lust for power. You decorated the grave of Yakub Memon (convicted in the Mumbai bomb blasts case) and during Lok Sabha elections showed the Pakistani flag.""Taunting Sena UBT for losing assembly elections and even failing to secure leader of opposition's post in the assembly, Shinde said: ""They gave up Hindutva, and now they are 'na ghar ka, na ghat ka'. Five times I told him (Uddhav), 'Let's form an alliance with BJP.' Why did you go with Congress?""Shinde criticised Maharashtra PCC chief Harshwardhan Sakpal for likening Fadnavis to Aurangzeb and demanded an apology.",Devendra Fadnavis says violence was pre-planned. Deputy Eknath Shinde accuses Sena UBT of abandoning ideals of Balasaheb Thackeray and giving up Hindutva ideology by joining hands with Congress. Shindes also criticises Maharashtra PCC chief Harshwardhan Sakpal for likening FadNavis to Aurangzeb.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119185707,imgsize-1490931,width-400,resizemode-4/119185707.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India on Tuesday hit back at Pakistan for labelling PM Modi's remark on the bilateral issues with Islamabad ""misleading and one-sided"".The external affairs ministry said the world knows that the real issue is Pakistan’s ""active promotion and sponsorship of cross-border terrorism "" and that Islamabad should ""vacate Indian territory under its illegal and forcible occupation"".In an interview with with American podcaster Lex Fridman, PM Modi on Sunday said that “every attempt to foster peace with Pakistan was met with hostility and betrayal” and that he hoped that “wisdom would prevail on the leadership in Islamabad to improve bilateral ties.”Also read: ‘We chose peace, they chose proxy war’: PM Modi on India-Pakistan relations on podcast with Lex Fridman Fridman asked the Prime Minister about the tense conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations and whether he saw a path to friendship and peace.PM Modi responded by recalling India’s partition in 1947, describing it as a painful and bloody chapter in history. He explained that despite India's acceptance of partition, Pakistan did not choose peaceful coexistence.""After getting their own way, we expected them to live and let live, and yet, they chose not to foster a harmonious coexistence. Time and again, they decided to be at odds with India. They have waged a proxy war against us,"" PM Modi said in the podcast.He accused Pakistan of exporting terror, saying that India is not its only victim — terrorist activities linked to Pakistan have impacted the entire world.""Wherever terror strikes in the world, the trail somehow leads to Pakistan.

JAMMU: Police arrested a woman pilgrim near the sanctum sanctorum of the cave shrine of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi in Reasi district of Jammu & Kashmir after they found a loaded pistol in her possession.Police identified the accused as one Jyoti Gupta , who claimed she is a retired police constable from New Delhi, who they intercepted with the pistol and six cartridges during routine checks on the intervening night of March 14-15.“The licence for the weapon in the possession of Ms Gupta expired a couple of years ago. Katra police are investigating the case further after registering an FIR,” police said. Police also booked one Sanjay Singh , a pilgrim from Uttar Pradesh, after they found two cartridges in his bag near the same area on Monday.Security remains high in and around the shrine since six pilgrims including a child were killed and 48 others injured in twin explosions set off by terrorists near the Banganga river, 2km from Katra, on way to the Vaishno Devi shrine on July 21, 2003. Security was further tightened around the holy cave shrine after security forces neutralized four terrorists in an encounter in Jammu’s Nagrota on Nov 20, 2020.","Police arrested a woman pilgrim near the sanctum sanctorum of the cave shrine of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi in Reasi district of Jammu & Kashmir.

NAGPUR: Authorities clamped a curfew across 30% of Nagpur Tuesday following clashes in the heart of the city on Monday night after protests demanding the removal of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's tomb from the Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district in Maharashtra.Over 50 people have been arrested and 10 police teams deployed to track down other suspects. Police have filed six FIRs against more than 1,200 people, including members of VHP and Bajrang Dal. A single FIR at Ganeshpeth police station charged 650 people.Tensions remained high but no fresh violence was reported Tuesday. Over 1,000 security personnel fortified sensitive areas while 8,000 were on standby. Police conducted marches in central Nagpur.The riots left at least 70 wounded, two of them critically, and caused extensive damage, with mobs torching two bulldozers and 50 vehicles.Cops in motorbike helmets and an intelligence apparatus that allegedly missed clues to what was coming cut a sorry figure in central Nagpur late Monday as rioters, driven by rumours, outnumbered and overwhelmed them in a one-sided battle that left the Maharashtra city convulsing, report Proshun Chakraborty & Viraj Deshpande.After battling rioters for four hours at Mahal, where the violence originated over a demand to remove Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's tomb from Khultabad in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district, police apparently failed to fortify other communally sensitive localities within a 3km radius. Once the protest against Aurangzeb's tomb triggered rioting, the security establishment appeared ill-prepared to prevent the violence from spiralling.Sources said a police contingent was sent out to tackle the rioters in makeshift protective gear. The ferocity of the attack and the team's alleged lack of preparation left them exposed. ""There was no plan in place to control the mob, with police failing to anticipate the possibility of lanes and alleys turning into battle zones. While the cops were trying to push back stone-pelters, many began vandalising vehicles and shops,"" a witness said.A senior police officer admitted to ""misjudging the situation and failing to predict the mob's movements"". ""They should have known that central Nagpur is a sensitive area with a mixed population. Police should have been mobilised in other sensitive areas like Hansapuri and Mominpura to stave off an escalation in violence,"" a source said.","Authorities clamped a curfew across 30% of Nagpur Tuesday following clashes in the heart of the city.

Prince Harry to be deported? US Court orders release of UK royal's immigration files after drug use admission,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/prince-harry-to-be-deported-us-court-orders-release-of-uk-royals-immigration-files-after-drug-use-admission/articleshow/119095407.cms,"Prince Harry (File photo)

UK royal Prince Harry once again is facing deportation possibility as a US court has ruled that Prince Harry's immigration files be disclosed by Tuesday.Judge Carl Nichols has directed the release of documents pertaining to the Duke of Sussex's US visa application, following a Freedom of Information (FOI)request. The conservative Heritage Foundation, a US think-tank, initiated the FOI request, suggesting the duke potentially omitted previous drug use which could have affected his visa eligibility. Court documents dated March 15 show Judge Nichols instructed the US Department of Homeland Security to provide a redacted version by Tuesday, as reported by Sky News.Despite the same judge ruling in September last year that public interest in Harry's immigration records was not substantial, the judge has now revised his position.The federal judge has mandated that by end of Tuesday (local time), the Department of Homeland Security must disclose Prince Harry's immigration documentation. These records could potentially indicate whether he declared any prior drug use before entering the United States, as specified in court documents.The Heritage Foundation sought this reversal, questioning Harry's 2020 US entry following his admissions about cocaine, marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms in his book Spare. In his autobiography, Harry revealed: ""cocaine didn't do anything for me"", and added: ""Marijuana is different, that actually really did help me.""The foundation argued that his visa application responses regarding past drug use could raise concerns about governmental procedures. The Department of Homeland Security's lawyers agreed in February to release censored versions, despite previously denying the FOI request. Department lawyer John Bardo stated in court documents that they would remove information deemed withholdable by the Court.The federal government has opposed attempts to release Harry's documents, with defence attorneys noting that authorities claim the ""request does not meet the public interest standard set forth"" in Freedom of Information Act provisions.Even US President Donald Trump had addressed these concerns surrounding the UK prince and stated to The New York Post in February that he wouldn't deport Harry, saying: ""I'll leave him alone."" He further took a jab at his wife saying, ""He's got enough problems with his wife. She's terrible.""

Wayne Gretzky estates faces backlash over altered LCBO wine labels

Public admiration for Canadian sports legend Wayne Gretzky took an unexpected turn when modified LCBO shelf tags that mocked his wine business products appeared on the internet. Reddit users shared the photos first in their r/Canada subreddit until they removed them but their widespread propagation across the internet continued.The doctored labels ridiculed Wayne Gretzky Estates wines with phrases such as “Weak & Backstabbery” for Pinot Grigio and “Acrid & Treasony” for Chardonnay. Another label for Cabernet Merlot took a direct jab at Wayne Gretzky’s character, reading, “This Merlot is as weak as it’s name sake’s moral fibre.” Despite the uproar, the LCBO stated, “At this time, we have found no evidence to suggest that any product label was altered in our stores.”The scandal has emerged at a time when people increasingly demand a boycott of Wayne Gretzky Estates in Niagara-on-the-Lake due to Gretzky's connections with former U.S. President Donald Trump. Gretzky faced heightened criticism when Wayne Gretzky attended the post-2024 U.S. election victory party of Donald Trump wearing his MAGA hat. Canadian citizens viewed this gesture as evidence of being unfaithful to Canada mainly because Donald Trump continually expressed interest in incorporating Canada into the United States as its 51st state.Beyond social media, critics have flooded Wayne Gretzky Estates with one-star Google reviews, citing political reasons rather than the quality of its wine and whisky. One reviewer initially praised the products but later edited their post, saying, “Gretzky has clearly decided he loves Trump more than Canada. I can no longer support him or anything with his name on it.”In response, the winery urged the customers to provide feedback based on actual experiences, adding, “We value all guest feedback and are committed to providing the best possible experience.”Also Read: “Hardest record to break”: Wayne Gretzky reveals his favorite all-time NHL record and why he considers it unbreakable The controversy highlights the intersection of sports, politics, and consumer sentiment, leaving Wayne Gretzky Estates at the center of an unexpected public relations storm.",Wayne Gretzky estates faces backlash over altered LCBO wine labels.

A plane crash on Monday resulted in the deaths of at least 12 people when a small passenger aircraft crashed into the sea while taking off from Roatán, a Caribbean island off Honduras.The Lanhsa Airlines aircraft was headed for La Ceiba on the mainland when it made a sharp turn to the right of the runway and plunged into the water, civil aviation official Carlos Padilla confirmed.“The plane almost fell on us. I was fishing,” an eyewitness told HCH television. The fire department reported that five people were rescued, while one passenger remains missing. Among the dead was Honduran musician Aurelio Martínez, a well-known figure in the Garifuna music scene, according to local media.The flight was carrying 15 passengers, two pilots, and a flight attendant. One of the survivors, a 40-year-old French citizen, is being transported to a hospital in San Pedro Sula for treatment, Major Wilmer Guerrero of the fire department said. The crash happened about a kilometre from the coast, and authorities suspect an “apparent mechanical failure” in the British-made Jetstream 41 caused the accident.Honduran President Xiomara Castro said she had “immediately activated” an emergency response team, including the armed forces and firefighters, to assist with rescue and recovery efforts. Investigations are ongoing while search teams continue looking for the missing passenger.","A small passenger aircraft crashed into the sea while taking off from Roatán, a Caribbean island off Honduras.

How did Sudiksha Konanki vanish? What are the unanswered questions?



As Indian-origin 20-year-old Sudiksha Konanki remains missing even after 11 days of intensive search in the Dominican Republic where she went on vacation early this month, her parents have now urged the DR authorities to declare their daughter dead. Konanki's father initially suspected foul play and egged on the administration to widen their search when the mysterious disappearance of the Pitt University student was seen as a case of drowning, but now the parents said they don't think there is any foul play.ABC News reported that the family sent a formal letter to the authorities Monday acknowledging that there is no suspected foul play involved in Konanki's presumed death after she vanished from a Punta Cana beach on March 6.Konanki's parents wrote they have full trust in the investigation process and they believe Joshua Riibe , the 24-year-old with whom Konanki was last seen, has been cooperating with the investigators.""Given these circumstances, and after much deliberation, we request that the police department proceed with the legal declaration of her death. We understand that certain legal procedures must be followed and are prepared to comply with any necessary formalities or documentation,"" her parents wrote. ""Initiating this process will allow our family to begin the grieving process and address matters related to her absence. While no declaration can truly ease our grief, we trust that this step will bring some closure and enable us to honor her memory,"" the letter said.The request for the legal declaration of death came as Riibe's lawyers gave an ultimatum to the police that Riibe must be released from police surveillance.Sudiksha Konanki was last seen on March 6 in surveillance footage. According to Riibe, they went to the seawater where they almost drowned. But Riibe said he battled against the waves and dragged Konanki out of the water. He said he passed out as soon as he reached the shore and when he woke up Konanki was not there. He thought Konanki must have returned to the resort and he also came back to the resort. He said he asked Konanki whether she was fine after the duo battled the waves and reached the shore but he got no answer.Cops detained Riibe in the resort and took his passport so that he couldn't leave the country. They have been grilling him whether he was absolutely certain that Riibe pulled Konanki out of the water and that she had not drowned. Konanki's clothes were found on the beach hinting that in all probability she got drowned. But as her body was not found, officials think it may have got stuck in some reef under water.Ribe has not been named as an accused in the case but only as a person of interest. But he was not being allowed to leave the hotel without cops.","Sudiksha Konanki's parents want her to be declared officially dead. The 20-year- old Pitt University student was last seen on March 6.

WASHINGTON : The smackdown was swift, but the blowback was brutal. The Trump White House on Monday reaped a whirlwind in history after sowing the wind with a snarky putdown to a French politician's suggestion that the United States should return the Statue of Liberty , a gift from France, because Americans have chosen tyranny over freedom.""If it weren’t for the U.S., the French would be speaking German right now. So, they should be very grateful to our great country,"" White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt clapped back, alluding to U.S help during World War Two when Hitler's Germany marched into France.The putdown came in response to remarks by Raphaël Glucksmann, a left-wing politician in France, who said “It (Statue of Liberty) was our gift to you. But apparently you despise her. So she will be happy here with us.”Leavitt also referred to Glucksmann as an ""unnamed, low-level politician,"" manifesting the disdain with which the Trump White House speaks of many foreign leaders not aligned with its MAGA worldview.Blowback to the comments from the White House spokesperson came not from the French, but from many Americans better versed in history.""Such a shocking, insulting statement about an ally from anyone, let alone a senior White House official. I hope our @PressSec knows that it's only because of the French that we have an independent United States of America,"" Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Russia, said. Many others pointed out that it was German defeat at the hands of Russia on the eastern front that save France.Indeed, French help in freeing America from British colonial rule is consecrated right in front of the White House at Lafayette Park, with a statue of Major General Marquis Gilbert de Lafayette, who fought alongside George Washington at the Battle of Yorktown. Washington DC itself is a French-designed city, laid out by Pierre Charles L'Enfant -- buried in Arlington National Cemetery -- on the lines of Paris and Versailles.Lost on the briefing cross-talk: French support for American freedom came in preference to India, where Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan beseeched Louis XVI, and later Napolean, for help against the British, only to see them choose to fund the Americans. Ironically, Lord Cornwallis who surrendered at Yorktown in 1781 later went to India and played a key role in defeating Tipu Sultan in the Battle of SrirangapatnaA little spark of that history is preserved in the American national anthem, the star spangled banner, in which the line ""rockets red glare"" is a reference to Congreve rockets used during the bombardment of Fort McHenry in Baltimore Harbor. The artillery was inspired by iron-cased rockets using by Tipu's forces during the Anglo-Mysore war","A French politician suggested that the United States should return the Statue of Liberty.

Donlad Trump's warning to Tesla protestors

Tesla facilities and vehicles across the US are facing protests and vandalism. The Tesla Takedown protests are said to be in response to the role of Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the cost-cutting task force Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in Donald Trump administration. Some ""Tesla Takedown"" protests have also been destructive with fires intentionally set at Tesla showrooms and charging stations in Colorado and Massachusetts last week. There has also been a spike in Cybertruck vandalism across the US, and some car owners are defacing their own Teslas in protest of Musk. Violence against Tesla dealerships will be labeled domestic terrorism and perpetrators will ""go through hell,"" the US President Donald Trump said last week in a show of support for Elon Musk.Now a man named Jackron -- who describes himself as a former Globalist, Mechanical Engineer and Researcher -- in his Twitter profile tagged Elon Musk and claimed that he infiltrated one of the protests at a Tesla dealership and got to know a few things. The things he wrote include how these Tesla protests are organised through Facebook groups. Along with the post he also shared a printed paper that he said is a copy of anti-Elon chants distributed among the protestors.Tagging Elon Musk, Jacktron wrote,Earlier Elon Musk wrote a post 'wondering' why so much hate against him considering that his companies make great products and people love them. ""My companies make great products that people love and I’ve never physically hurt anyone. So why the hate and violence against me? Because I am a deadly threat to the woke mind parasite and the humans it controls,"" he wrote.Last week, President Trump warned those engaging in arson and vandalism against Tesla.

Conservative leader Poilievre 'not my friend,' says Trump

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday called Canada ""a nasty country to deal with,"" amid the ongoing tariff war between the two countries, triggered by Trump's tariff moves and reciprocated by Canada.Trump also took aim at Justin Trudeau, Canada's now-former prime minister who was succeeded by Mark Carney last week.""One of the nastiest countries to deal with is Canada. Now, this was Trudeau — good old Justin. I call him 'Governor Trudeau.' His people were nasty and they weren't telling the truth,"" the Republican leader told Fox News host Laura Ingraham during an interview.The American President, who began his second term in January, has repeatedly threatened to make Canada the ""51st US state."" The Canadian government rebuffed his remarks.When Ingraham suggested that Trump's policies could benefit the Carney-led Liberal Party's electoral prospects - Canada is to hold federal polls by October - the latter responded that it would be easier to work with the Liberals than the Conservatives, Canada's main opposition party which has consistently led opinion polls.""I don't care. I think it's easier to deal, actually, with a Liberal and maybe they're going to win, but I don't really care. It doesn't matter to me at all,"" he stated.Trump further said that Pierre Poilievre, Canada's leader of opposition, is ""no friend of mine.""""The Conservative that's running is, stupidly, no friend of mine. I don't know him, but he said negative things,"" he said without naming Poilievre, who is running to be Canada's prime minister.The Liberals, who have been in power since Trudeau was elected PM in 2015, just weeks ago looked headed toward certain defeat to the Conservatives in the election, which must be held by October 20 but could happen earlier.But they are mounting a major comeback after Trudeau stepped down and Carney, a former central banker, was elected by the Liberals as their leader.

JFK assassination: New released files raise more questions than answers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jfk-assassination-new-released-files-raise-more-questions-than-answers/articleshow/119189147.cms,".

The JFK assassination and the CIA’s shadow

Unpacking Underhill’s claim in the released files

On March 18, 2025, the Trump administration fulfilled a long-standing campaign promise of releasing approximately 80,000 pages of previously classified documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy. The move, heralded as a step toward ""maximum transparency"" by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard , reignited one of America’s most enduring mysteries.Among the trove of documents, one line has captured significant attention: ""A small clique within the CIA was responsible for the assassination."" Attributed to intelligence asset Gary Underhill in a newly unredacted file, this explosive claim has thrust the Central Intelligence Agency back into the spotlight of conspiracy theories that have swirled around the JFK assassination for over six decades.The assassination of John F Kennedy on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, remains a defining moment in American history, not only for its tragedy but for the persistent doubts it has sown about the official narrative.The Warren Commission, established by President Lyndon B Johnson in 1964, concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald, a former Marine with communist sympathies, acted alone in killing the president. Yet, public skepticism has never abated. Opinion polls over the decades consistently show that a majority of Americans—often upwards of 60%—believe the assassination involved a conspiracy, with the CIA frequently cast as a prime suspect.The CIA’s potential involvement has been a recurring theme in conspiracy theories, fueled by the agency’s covert operations during the Cold War. At the time of Kennedy’s death, the CIA was deeply engaged in anti-communist efforts, including plots to assassinate Cuban leader Fidel Castro and surveillance of domestic dissidents. Kennedy’s own fraught relationship with the agency added plausibility to such narratives.Over the years, critics like Jim Garrison, James Douglass, and Mark Lane have argued that the CIA, possibly in concert with the military-industrial complex or organized crime, orchestrated Kennedy’s death to preserve Cold War tensions or thwart his moves toward détente with the Soviet Union and Cuba.Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump's secretary of health and human services and the son of Robert Kennedy and nephew of John F Kennedy, too has alleged that the CIA was involved in his uncle's assassination, an accusation the agency calls baseless.The newly released files include CIA memos, FBI reports, and previously unrecognized records.Gary Underhill, identified as a CIA intelligence asset in the released documents, reportedly made the statement ""A small clique within the CIA was responsible for the assassination"" shortly after Kennedy’s death. According to the file, Underhill described this group as ""a corrupt element every bit as ruthless - and more efficient - as the mafia."" A military journalist with ties to the intelligence community, Underhill claimed to have fled Washington, DC, in fear for his life following the assassination, only to die in 1964 under circumstances some deem suspicious—a single gunshot to the head ruled as suicide. His assertion, now unredacted for the first time, aligns with long-standing theories but raises critical questions about its credibility and significance.First, the context of Underhill’s claim within the files is key. The document does not present it as an official CIA finding but as a recorded statement from an individual with insider knowledge, likely gathered during post-assassination debriefings or investigations. Underhill’s proximity to the agency lends weight to his words, yet his role as an asset—rather than a high-ranking officer—suggests he may have lacked access to definitive proof.Second, the phrase ""a small clique"" implies a rogue faction rather than an agency-wide plot, a nuance that complicates the narrative. This aligns with theories posited by some researchers who argue that specific CIA officers, such as those involved in anti-Castro operations, may have had motives to target Kennedy.However, according to a Reuters report, an initial review of the documents found no deviations from the main narrative.Fredrik Logevall, a Harvard history professor and author of ""JFK: Coming of Age in the American Century 1917-56,"" suggested the new files could provide additional context.""It's valuable to get all the documentation out, ideally in unredacted form.

Ukraine’s sovereignty is not negotiable, Russia must give up seized land: Zelenskyy

WASHINGTON/MOSCOW:Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump agreed on a phone call Tuesday to seek a limited 30-day ceasefire against energy and infrastructure targets in Russia and Ukraine.Putin, though, stopped short of agreeing to a broader US-backed month-long truce.Talks aimed at advancing toward a broader peace plan, including a maritime ceasefire in Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace, would begin “immediately”, White House said. It wasn’t clear whether Ukraine is on board with the limited ceasefire plan.Calling his talks with Putin “productive”, Trump said, “We’ll be working quickly for a complete ceasefire”.Putin also emphasised that the “complete cessation of foreign military assistance and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv” is a condition for any permanent peace deal.Trump had been pressuring Putin to agree to a 30-day ceasefire that he hopes would move one step closer to ending Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II. The war has killed or wounded hundreds of thousands of people, displaced millions and reduced entire towns to rubble.Trump has hinted a permanent peace deal could include territorial concessions by Kyiv and control of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant . Trump’s overtures to Putin since returning to the White House in Jan have left traditional US allies wary.Ukraine and its Western allies have long described Russi a’s invasion of Ukraine as an imperialist land grab, and Ukrainian President Zelensky has accused Putin of deliberately prolonging the war.Zelensky, who arrived in Finland on Tuesday to discuss the Nato state’s support for Ukraine, said Ukraine’s sovereignty is not negotiable and Russia must surrender the territory it has seized. He said Moscow’s ambitions will not stop at Ukraine if it is allowed to keep the territory it has seized. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned on Tuesday Russia had massively expanded its military-industrial production capacity in preparation for “future confrontation with European democracies.""Speaking to Trump late on Monday, British PM Keir Starmer “reiterated that all must work together to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position to secure a just and lasting peace,” the British leader's spokesperson said.Russia seized the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and most of four eastern Ukrainian regions following its invasion in February 2022. All told, it controls about a fifth of Ukrainian territory.Putin said he sent troops into Ukraine because Nato’s creeping expansion threatened Russia’s security. He has demanded Ukraine drop any ambition of joining the Western military alliance.Putin has also said Russia must keep control of Ukrainian territory it has seized, Western sanctions should be eased and Kyiv must stage a presidential election.REUTERS","Putin, though, stopped short of agreeing to a broader US-backed month-long truce.

Series of attack on Tesla vehicles and dealerships

US President Donald Trump claimed that recent arson attacks on Tesla vehicles across the country could be acts of ""domestic political terrorism"" driven by 'left-wing operatives'. His remarks came during a segment on The Ingraham Angle Tuesday night.The conversation with Fox News host Laura Ingraham touched on the incident of five Tesla set on fire in Las Vegas. When pressed by Ingraham on whether he considers these attacks an act of domestic terrorism, Trump responded, ""I think so,"" adding that he believes the perpetrators may be linked to politically motivated groups on the left.""The good thing is they have a lot of cameras in those places, and they've caught some already having to do with that,"" Trump said, adding, ""I think that you will find out that they're paid by people that are very highly political on the left.""Trump also praised Tesla CEO Elon Musk , describing him as a ""patriot"" who became an ally during the 2024 presidential campaign. ""I hardly knew Elon until the election,"" Trump admitted. ""He turned out that he liked me better than he liked these radical lunatics... because he's an intelligent person."" According to Trump, Musk believed that the country's future was at risk if he did not win re-election.The recent in Las Vegas is just one in a series of violent attacks on Tesla. In another incident recently, a man attempting to torch a Tesla charging station in protest against US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk ended up setting himself on fire, authorities said. In another incident of alleged arson, fire erupted in two Tesla Cybertrucks at a dealership in Kansas City, Missouri on Monday evening.The recent attack in Las Vegas is just one in a series of violent incidents targeting Tesla. According to the Kansas City Police Department, a fire erupted in two Tesla Cybertrucks at a dealership in Kansas City, Missouri, on Monday evening.

He added that it was “really interesting” and that he plan ned to “take a look at it.” A few hours later, he made his post.Anthony Guglielmi, a Secret Service spokesperson, said: “We are aware of the president’s decision to terminate protection for Hunter and Ashley Biden. The Secret Service will comply and is actively working with the protective details and the White House to ensure compliance as soon as possible.” A representative for the Biden family declined to comment.

French politician questions US on Statue of Liberty; White House hits back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/french-politician-questions-us-on-statue-of-liberty-white-house-hits-back/articleshow/119186373.cms,"Statue of Liberty

Lost on briefing cross-talk:

TOI correspondent from Washington: The smackdown was swift, but the blowback was brutal. The Trump White House on Monday reaped a whirlwind in history after sowing the wind with a snarky putdown to a French politician’s suggestion that the US should return the Statue of Liberty , a gift from France, because Americans have chosen tyranny over freedom.“If it weren’t for the US, the French would be speaking German right now. So, they should be very grateful to our great country,” White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said, alluding to US help during World War II when Hitler’s Germany marched into France.The putdown came in response to remarks by Raphael Glucksmann, a left-wing politician in France, who said “It (Statue of Liberty) was our gift to you. But apparently you despise her. So she will be happy here with us.” Leavitt also referred to Glucksmann as an “unnamed, low-level politician”, manifesting the disdain with which the Trump White House speaks of many foreign politicians not aligned with its MAGA worldview.Blowback to the comments from the White House spokesperson came not from the French, but from many Ameri cans better versed in history.“Such a shocking, insulting statement about an ally from anyone, let alone a senior White House official. I hope our @PressSec knows that it’s only because of the French that we have an independent United States of America,” Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Russia, said. Many others said it was German defeat at the hands of Russia on the eastern front that saved France.Indeed, French help in freeing America from British colonial rule is consecrated right in front of the White House at Lafayette Park, with a statue of Major General Marquis Gilbert de Lafayette, who fought alongside George Washington at the Battle of Yorktown.Washington DC itself is a French-designed city, laid out by Pierre Charles L’Enfant — buried in Arlington National Cemetery —on the lines of Paris and Versailles.French support for American freedom came in preference to India, where Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan beseeched Louis XVI, and later Napolean, for help against the British, only to see them choose to fund the Americans. Ironically, Lord Cornwallis who surrendered at Yorktown in 1781 later went to India and played a key role in defeating Tipu Sultan in the Battle of Srirangapatna.A little spark of that history is preserved in the American national anthem, the star spangled banner, in which the line “rockets red glare” is a reference to Congreve rockets used during the bombardment of Fort McHenry in Baltimore Harbor.The artillery was inspired by iron-cased rockets used by Tipu’s forces during the Anglo-Mysore war.","A French politician suggested that the US should return the Statue of Liberty because Americans have chosen tyranny over freedom.

Just hours after President Donald Trump called for the impeachment of a judge who sought to pause the removal of more than 200 migrants to El Salvador, chief justice John G Roberts Jr issued a rare public statement. “For more than two centuries,” the chief justice said, “it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.”President Trump, in a post on Truth Social about the judge, said, “This Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama, was not elected President He didn’t WIN the popular VOTE (by a lot!), he didn’t WIN ALL SEVEN SWING STATES, he didn’t WIN 2,750 to 525 Counties, HE DIDN’T WIN ANYTHING!

Trump's order

A federal judge on Tuesday blocked US President Donald Trump 's executive order prohibiting transgender individuals from serving in the military, adding to a series of judicial challenges to his broad policy initiatives.In Washington DC, US District Judge Ana Reyes determined that Trump's directive to exclude transgender troops likely infringes upon their constitutional protections.She postponed implementing her decision until Friday to allow the administration to lodge an appeal. ""The court knows that this opinion will lead to heated public debate and appeals. In a healthy democracy, both are positive outcomes,"" Reyes wrote. ""We should all agree, however, that every person who has answered the call to serve deserves our gratitude and respect.""The preliminary injunction was granted following a request from lawyers representing six active-duty transgender service members and two prospective military recruits. The plaintiffs include distinguished service members: an Army Reserves platoon leader from Pennsylvania, a Bronze Star recipient Army major who served in Afghanistan, and a Navy Sailor of the Year award winner.Their legal representatives from the National Center for Lesbian Rights and GLAD Law emphasise these troops simply wish to continue their military service. The attorneys highlighted the policy's sudden reversal, arguing it undermines unit cohesion and military strength whilst disparaging honourable transgender service members.On January 27, Trump issued an executive order stating that transgender service members' sexual identity ""conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life"" and undermines military preparedness.Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth responded with a policy that generally excludes individuals with gender dysphoria from military service. This condition, characterised by distress arising from a mismatch between assigned and identified gender, is associated with depression and suicidal ideation.The plaintiffs' legal representatives assert that Trump's order violates Fifth Amendment equal protection rights for transgender individuals. Government solicitors maintain that military officials should retain broad authority to manage service member assignments and deployments without judicial oversight.Whilst transgender service members constitute less than 1% of active-duty personnel, thousands currently serve in the military.A 2016 Defence Department policy permitted open transgender military service. During Trump's presidency, he implemented a transgender service ban, which the Supreme Court allowed. President Joe Biden later reversed this ban upon taking office.Hegseth's February 26 policy declares that service members or applicants showing symptoms of, having a history of, or currently diagnosed with gender dysphoria are unsuitable for military service due to strict mental and physical requirements.This comes after federal judges in Seattle and Baltimore have separately suspended Trump's executive order halting federal support for gender-affirming care for transgender youth under 19. Recently, a judge prevented prison officials from moving three transgender women to men's facilities and ending their hormone therapy access.Trump has also issued orders regarding gender-related school curriculum and aimed to prevent transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.","A federal judge on Tuesday blocked US President Donald Trump's executive order prohibiting transgender individuals from serving in the military.

While the raid successfully led to the detention of more than two dozen individuals, including foreign nationals, it quickly descended into disorder as locals swarmed the premises to seize valuables, as reported by the local Pakistani newspaper The Nation. Laptops, monitors, keyboards, and other electronic equipment intended for investigative purposes were instead carried away by opportunistic looters.Videos circulating on social media captured scenes of individuals, young and old, forcing their way into the building and openly making off with electronic devices. A large crowd gathered outside, and despite the presence of law enforcement, the looting continued unabated. Eyewitnesses reported that FIA officials struggled to control the situation, allowing the ransacking to proceed unchecked. Amid the chaos, some foreigners linked to the scamming operation reportedly escaped.Sources within the FIA, quoted by The Nation, indicated that the agency had been aware of the call center's illegal activities for some time but delayed action while awaiting approval from senior authorities. The center was allegedly involved in defrauding individuals across multiple countries, using Pakistani employees to execute scams and extort money.The individuals detained during the raid were transferred to the FIA office for further questioning. However, the agency has remained tight-lipped about the broader investigation, declining to provide additional details despite repeated inquiries.

However, his extremist views and conflicts with another militant leader, Haji Namdar, led to his expulsion from Bara Qambarkhel within six months.After continued internal strife, a tribal jirga forced both Shakir and Pir Saifur Rehman out of Bara in early 2005. The group later came under the leadership of Mangal Bagh, a former bus driver turned militant, who was elevated to amir in May 2005.Pakistani security forces launched their first military operation against Lashkar-i-Islam in mid-2005, demolishing the house of Haji Rabat and destroying an FM radio station the group had set up inside a mosque.The blast comes less than a day after another explosion at Maulana Abdul Aziz Mosque in South Waziristan on Friday. The attack, carried out using an improvised explosive device (IED), left Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) district chief Maulana Abdullah Nadeem and several others injured.The province has witnessed repeated attacks on mosques, particularly during Friday prayers when large gatherings make them vulnerable.Last month, a suicide blast at Darul Uloom Haqqania seminary killed six people, including JUI-S leader Maulana Hamidul Haq Haqqani, and injured 15 others.The Pakistan Army on Friday said that 18 of the 26 hostages killed in the Balochistan Liberation Army's recent ambush on a train were army and paramilitary soldiers.Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General, Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, stated during a press conference with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti that militants executed all 26 hostages before the military operation began.“The 26 hostages include 18 army and paramilitary soldiers, three other government officials and five civilians,” he confirmed.","Mufti Munir Shakir, the founder of the outlawed militant group Lashkar-i-Islam, succumbed to his injuries at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), hospital authorities confirmed.

DHAKA: Reacting to remarks made by US director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard , the interim govt on Monday said linking Bangladesh to the idea of ‘ Islamist caliphate ’ without any valid ground undermines the hard work of the countless people of the country and their friends and partners around the world who are committed to peace, stability, and progress.In a statement shared by chief adviser Muhammad Yunus’s press wing, the govt said Bangladesh “strongly condemns” any efforts to link the country to any form of ‘Islamist caliphate’.The govt also noted with “deep concern and distress” the remarks made by Gabbard, in which she alleged “persecution and killing” of religious minorities in Bangladesh and that “the threat of Islamic terrorists” in the country is “roo ted” in the “ideology and objective” to “rule and govern with an Islamist caliphate”.This statement, the interim govt said, is both misleading and damaging to the image and reputation of Bangladesh, a nation whose traditional practice of Islam has been famously inclusive and peaceful and that has made remarkable strides in its fight against extremism and terrorism .“Gabbard’s comments are not based on any evidence or specific allegations. They paint an entire nation with a broad and unjustified brush,” said the govt in its statement.Her comments on religious violence were unfounded and risked fanning sectarian tensions , it added. Bangladesh, like many countries around the world, has faced challenges of extremism, but it has continuously worked in partnership with the international community, including the US, to address these issues through law enforcement, social reforms, and other counter-terrorism efforts , the govt said.Political leaders and public figures should base their statements, especially about the most sensitive issues, on actual knowledge and take care not to reinforce harmful stereotypes, to fan fears and potentially even stoke sectarian tensions, the statement reads.“In support of our shared global efforts to combat extremism and terrorism, the interim govt of Bangladesh remains committed to engaging in constructive dialogue based on facts and on respect for the sovereignty and security of all nations,” it mentioned.",US director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard made remarks about Bangladesh.

(Picture credit: AP)

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres on Friday called for urgent international support for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, warning that cuts in humanitarian aid could lead to a disaster.Speaking at a joint press briefing in Dhaka during his four-day visit to Bangladesh, Guterres urged the international community to provide financial and political assistance to both the refugees and their host communities.""I strongly appeal to the international community to allow us to avoid any tragedy,"" he said. He also praised Bangladesh's “extraordinary generosity” in sheltering more than one million Rohingya refugees and described it as a testament to the country’s humanitarian spirit.Guterres visited Cox’s Bazar, where most of the Rohingya refugees live in overcrowded camps, and described the impact of global aid cuts on vulnerable populations as “a crime”, reported AP.He criticised the United States and European countries for slashing humanitarian assistance while increasing defence budgets.According to AP, the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) has warned that without urgent funding, food rations for Rohingya refugees could be cut by half next month. A recent WFP letter stated that $81 million is needed to sustain operations until the end of the year, including $15 million for April alone.Guterres assured that the UN will continue efforts to secure funding and stressed that Rohingya refugees must not be forgotten. ""We cannot accept that the international community forgets about the Rohingya,"" he said.Bangladesh’s Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus met with Guterres and urged the UN to mobilise humanitarian aid and support the repatriation of Rohingya refugees to Myanmar, which he described as the ultimate solution.""We are trying to raise attention to the plight of the Rohingya people. The world should know how they are suffering. There is a feeling of frustration,"" Yunus was quoted as saying by AP.Guterres emphasised that Myanmar remains the homeland of the Rohingya and called on all parties in Myanmar to ensure their safe and voluntary return. ""My message to all parties in Myanmar is clear: exercise maximum restraint, prioritise the protection of civilians, and create conditions for the Rohingya to return home,"" he said, as per PTI.Bangladesh has consistently maintained that repatriation is the only long-term solution, but efforts have stalled due to ongoing political instability in Myanmar. The Buddhist-majority nation has been accused of genocide against the Rohingya in an international court.As per ANI, Guterres reaffirmed the UN’s commitment to advocating for Rohingya rights and ensuring that they receive humanitarian assistance.He also attended a photo exhibition in Dhaka, interacted with youth and civil society members, and held a joint press conference with foreign adviser Touhid Hossain.His visit will conclude with an iftar hosted by the chief adviser before he departs from Dhaka on March 16.","United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres on Friday called for urgent international support for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.
