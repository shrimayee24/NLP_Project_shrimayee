Dharmasthala Mass Burial Case: Whistleblower Arrested by SIT After Inconsistencies Found

NEW DELHI: Sujata Bhat, who had previously alleged that her daughter Ananya disappeared from the Dharmasthala temple premises in 2003, had reportedly expressed her desire to withdraw the complaint during the Special Investigation Team's (SIT) interrogation.During the interrogation on Friday, the SIT found Sujata's statement to be contradictory to her earlier claims, suggesting she was lying and obstructing the legal process. Investigators noted that she appeared to be under significant pressure and was struggling with the sustained interrogation, PTI reported.While Sujata had earlier claimed that the disappearance of her daughter was part of a larger conspiracy, she disclosed the names of certain individuals allegedly involved in it on Friday.However, the SIT officials did not confirm the details, stating that the disclosures are being verified.The case has drawn widespread attention following allegations that the narrative of a missing girl may have been fabricated. The SIT's ongoing efforts focus on verifying Sujata’s claims and finding evidence to substantiate the complaint.Legal experts said even if Sujata formally withdraws her complaint, the SIT would likely continue the investigation, as the matter involves serious allegations and has already entered the judicial process.The case, which has triggered political sparring and public debates, remains under close watch, with the SIT expected to submit an interim report in the coming weeks, said a senior police official.","Sujata Bhat, who had previously alleged that her daughter Ananya disappeared from the Dharmasthala temple premises in 2003, had reportedly expressed her desire to withdraw the complaint.

Poll What should India prioritize in response to US tariffs? Adjust trade strategy Maintain independent policy

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump’s trade advisor Peter Navarro on Friday renewed his attack on India, accusing New Delhi of using American trade dollars to finance Russia’s war in Ukraine.Justifying Washington’s newly imposed 50 per cent tariffs on Indian imports, Navarro said that Indian refiners, working with “silent Russian partners,” were making huge profits by refining Russian oil and selling it in international markets while “Russia pockets hard currency to fund its war on Ukraine.”In a post on X, Navarro said, “India uses our dollars to buy discounted Russian crude. This isn’t just about India’s unfair trade—it’s about cutting off the financial lifeline India has extended to Putin’s war machine.”According to Navarro, “Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian oil made up less than 1% of India’s imports. Today? Over 30% -- more than 1.5 million barrels a day. This surge isn’t driven by domestic demand—it’s driven by Indian profiteers and carries an added price of blood and devastation in Ukraine.”Also read - 'Trump won't budge' : US says Russia-Ukraine conflict is 'Modi's war' “India’s Big Oil lobby has turned the largest democracy in the world into a massive refining hub and oil money laundromat for the Kremlin,” he claimed, adding that India now exports more than 1 million barrels a day in refined petroleum, over half of the Russian crude it imports.Navarro said the Biden administration “largely looked the other way at this madness,” while President Trump was confronting it directly. “A 50% tariff -- 25% for unfair trade and 25% for national security -- is a direct response. If India, the world’s largest democracy, wants to be treated like a strategic partner of the US, it needs to act like one. The road to peace in Ukraine runs through New Delhi.”Also read - Western voices back India against Trump's tariff war Expanding on the criticism, he remarked, “While the United States pays to arm Ukraine, India bankrolls Russia even as it slaps some of the world’s highest tariffs on US goods, which in turn punishes American exporters. We run a $50-billion trade deficit with India—and they’re using our dollars to buy Russian oil. They make a killing and Ukrainians die.”“It doesn’t stop there. India continues to buy Russian weapons—while demanding that US firms transfer sensitive military tech and build plants in India. That’s strategic freeloading,” he added.The remarks follow Donald Trump’s decision earlier this week to double tariffs on Indian imports, citing both trade imbalances and national security concerns.Navarro told Bloomberg TV that it was “real easy” for India to get the penalty removed by halting Russian oil purchases, but accused New Delhi of being “arrogant” in insisting it was their sovereign right.“India, you’re the biggest democracy in the world, okay? Act like one... side with the democracies...(instead) you’re getting in bed with the authoritarians,” he said, reminding India of its long-standing border dispute with China. “These are not your friends folks, okay? And the Russians. I mean, come on!”Navarro also controversially referred to the Russia-Ukraine conflict as “Modi’s war,” insisting India’s purchases were funding Moscow’s aggression. When an anchor corrected him, saying “you mean Putin’s war,” Navarro doubled down, repeating it was “Modi’s war.”While Navarro praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi as “a great leader” and India as “a mature democracy with intelligent people running it,” he maintained that New Delhi’s oil deals with Moscow undermined its claim to be a trusted US partner.His comments have drawn criticism within US policy circles, with some analysts pointing out that Washington has not penalised China or the European Union for continuing to buy Russian energy. Others noted that the US itself imports Russian nuclear fuel and precious metals.",US President Donald Trump’s trade advisor Peter Navarro on Friday renewed his attack on India.

'Show Red Eyes to US’ Owaisi Targets Modi Govt on Tariffs, Calls It Diplomatic Failure

NEW DELHI: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Friday questioned why Prime Minister Narendra Modi appears “scared of the US,” while slamming the government over the imposition of a 50 per cent tariff on Indian exports by the United States.Speaking to reporters, Owaisi questioned: ""US' Peter Navarro is making statements. Had the same statements been made on the PM by an Opposition leader in the country, the BJP would have attacked him. Why are they silent?...Why are you so scared of the US?""He called the move a “major loss” to the country’s trade, warning that sectors like motor parts, jewellery, gems, and readymade garments could face estimated losses of around Rs 60,000 crore.The AIMIM chief also pointed out that the tariff issue surfaced after Modi’s bilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump in February, and accused the government of remaining silent while failing to defend India’s exporters. Owaisi added that opposition leaders would have faced strong criticism from the BJP for making similar remarks.“The 50% tariff will cause a major loss to India's exporters...I think the Narendra Modi Government will have to answer to the people of the country...ModiGovt will have to answer what they are going to do for those who are going to suffer losses,” Owaisi said.Owaisi also referred to White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who sparked controversy by calling the Russia-Ukraine conflict “Modi’s war.”In a Bloomberg interview, Navarro claimed that India’s purchases of discounted Russian oil were “fuelling Russia’s war machine” and effectively making American taxpayers bear the cost. Owaisi criticised the government for not responding publicly to Navarro’s remarks.The senior leader also highlighted that India made a major mistake when Trump, during his first term, asked the country to stop buying oil from Iran. Owaisi said that if PM Modi had shown defiance or stood up to him then, the current situation with US tariffs might have been avoided.""Iran was selling us good quality oil at a reasonable price. We blinked there so they could see that they can scare us. That was the first mistake we made,"" Owaisi said.He added that BJP spokespersons should tell the country what is happening instead of taunting the Opposition.","AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi slammed the government over the imposition of a 50 per cent tariff on Indian exports by the United States.

Amit Shah Condemns Congress Culture Of Hatred, Demands Apology For Remarks On PM Modi’s Mother

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will fulfil its promise of making the country free of infiltrators.Speaking at a programme in Guwahati on the birth centenary of Assam’s first non-Congress chief minister, Golap Borbora, Shah said the high-power demography mission announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Independence Day would help study demographic patterns and identify infiltrators.""We had made a promise to Assam, but we have not been able to fulfil it in 10 years. But we will keep our promise and make Assam and the entire country free of illegal foreigners,"" he said.""I am among those people who believe that not a single infiltrator should stay in our country,"" he added.Shah recalled that Borbora, who led a Janata Party government in Assam from March 1978 to September 1979, had ordered a drive to clean up the voters' list during the Mangaldai Lok Sabha by-election.""Even in the absence of computerised electoral rolls, Borbora's government detected names of 36,780 illegal foreigners, and this cleansing of the voters' list can be deemed as the origin of the Assam Agitation,"" he said.He said the Election Commission is now cleaning the voters' list through the SIR process, but some parties are opposing it. ""It shows the moral degradation in today's politics,"" he said.Shah said Borbora would have opposed the parties that are against the SIR exercise.He also praised the Assam government for its measures against ""infiltrators"", including eviction of encroachments. He appreciated chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and his government for honouring Borbora, noting that Borbora was a socialist leader with no links to the BJP.Earlier in the day, Shah, in an apparent reference to state Congress president Gaurav Gogoi's alleged ""links"" with the foreign nation, said Assam cannot be led by people who make frequent visits to Pakistan.He asserted that the BJP-led NDA will form the third consecutive government in Assam next year.","Home minister Amit Shah said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will fulfil its promise of making the country free of infiltrators.

""If the EC finds the request genuine and backed by facts, it will surely extend it,"" the bench said. But Bhushan persisted with the request for an urgent hearing to which the bench acceded and posted the applications for hearing on Monday.Appearing for some other applicants, senior advocates Shoeb Alam and Shadan Farasat told the bench that prior to the Aug 22 order of the SC impleading all 12 recognised political parties in Bihar in the proceedings, as many as 80,000 claims and objections were filed.

India’s Languages Must Not Divide: Vice President Dhankhar | Strong Message Amid Rising Polarisation

,

NEW DELHI: Senior lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi, while making his arguments on the scope of a governor’s powers in assenting to bills, read out a passage from one of Justice Krishna Iyer’s judgments and compared the judge’s prowess in English with that of Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , incidentally both hailing from Kerala.Singhvi said unlike Justice Iyer’s English, which was lyrical and not difficult to understand, to fathom Tharoor’s English one would require a dictionary, a prowess which the MP uses to flummox many while responding to tricky or difficult questions. CJI B R Gavai said a Kerala HC judge is attempting to emulate Justice Iyer these days.After lunch break, Singhvi issued a clarification about his comments“I mentioned Tharoor in admiration and not in derogation.” The CJI in a lighter vein said, “Neither can we adjudicate that nor can we stop what will be said (about Singhvi’s remarks) on social media.”The bench, headed by CJI Gavai and comprising Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, PS Narsimha, and AS Chandurkar, focused on questions surrounding gubernatorial discretion. The bench noted that the Constituent Assembly had replaced the six-week timeline for a governor to act on a bill with the phrase “as soon as possible.”Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, argued that a state government cannot invoke Article 32 to seek a writ against a governor.Singhvi countered that a governor has no discretionary power to negate a bill passed by the assembly. He cautioned, “If a governor’s decisions are made non-justiciable, he could, rather than the people’s elected representatives, become the supreme law-making authority by merely consigning a bill to his cupboard. ”Singhvi explained that withholding a bill must be followed by returning it to the House for reconsideration. “If the House does not repass the bill, it falls through. This is the intended meaning of Article 200 regarding a governor’s power to withhold assent. Otherwise, the democratic will of the people could be subverted,” he said.The bench further asked whether a governor could reserve a bill for the President if it conflicted with central law. Singhvi replied that a governor may reserve a bill for the President when first presented. “If the House approves it again, with or without amendments, the governor has no option but to give assent,” he clarified.Concluding, Singhvi emphasised that a governor is merely an 'ornamental head' of the state.Arguments from states opposing presidential references are expected to continue on Tuesday.","Senior lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi compared the judge's prowess in English with that of Congress MP Shashi Tharoor.

Guatemala willing to take back minors

‘Forcibly removed’ without asylum

Advocacy groups slam move





The Trump administration is preparing to deport nearly 700 Guatemalan children who entered the United States without their parents, according to a letter sent Friday by Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, reported AP.In his letter to Angie Salazar, the acting director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) under the Department of Health and Human Services, Wyden warned that such removals would violate the ORR’s “child welfare mandate” and America’s long-standing obligation towards unaccompanied minors.“This move threatens to separate children from their families, lawyers, and support systems, to thrust them back into the very conditions they are seeking refuge from, and to disappear vulnerable children beyond the reach of American law and oversight,” Wyden wrote, urging the administration to scrap the plan.The planned deportations are part of the Trump administration’s broader immigration crackdown, which includes surging enforcement officers to Chicago, escalating deportations, and rolling back protections for migrants who had been allowed to live and work in the US.Guatemalan Foreign Affairs Minister Carlos Martínez said his government had informed Washington that it was prepared to take in several hundred children currently held in US facilities.He noted particular concern for minors who risk being transferred to adult detention centres once they turn 18.The number under discussion is a little over 600—almost double the 341 minors the country had previously agreed to repatriate, officials confirmed. Danilo Rivera, director of Guatemala’s Immigration Institute, had earlier said the aim was to bring the children back before they reached adulthood. He added that the process would be managed at Guatemala’s expense and would be classified as “voluntary return.”President Bernardo Arévalo has backed the plan, stressing that the government has both a legal and moral duty to advocate for the children. His comments followed a visit to Guatemala by US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.Wyden’s letter, citing whistleblowers, claimed that children without a parent or legal guardian as a sponsor, or without an active asylum case, “will be forcibly removed from the country.”“Unaccompanied children are some of the most vulnerable children entrusted to the government’s care,” he wrote. “In many cases, these children and their families have had to make the unthinkable choice to face danger and separation in search of safety.”Neither the White House nor the Department of Health and Human Services commented on the matter, which was first reported by CNN.The proposal has alarmed immigrant rights advocates. “We are outraged by the Trump administration’s renewed assault on the rights of immigrant children,” said Lindsay Toczylowski, president and CEO of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center. “We are not fooled by their attempt to mask these efforts as mere ‘repatriations.’ This is yet another calculated attempt to sever what little due process remains in the immigration system. ”Children traveling to the US without parents or guardians are typically handed over to ORR upon apprehension at the border. They are placed in government-supervised shelters or foster care until a sponsor—often a family member—is identified. Many also seek asylum, juvenile immigration status, or visas reserved for victims of exploitation.Advocates have already challenged in court the Trump administration’s tougher vetting procedures for unaccompanied children, arguing that the changes are inhumane and prolong family separations.",Guatemala willing to take back hundreds of children who entered the US without their parents.

At least three people were killed after protesters set ablaze a council building in Makassar, eastern Indonesia, officials said on Saturday.The nationwide unrest spread following the death of a young motorcycle taxi driver hit by a police vehicle.“From last night’s incident, three people died.

'Woke mind virus': Elon Musk slams CNN for not mentioning Minneapolis shooter Robin Westman was 'trans',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/woke-mind-virus-elon-musk-slams-cnn-for-not-mentioning-minneapolis-shooter-robin-westman-was-trans/articleshow/123577227.cms,"Was the Shooter Trans?



Minneapolis Shooting: Leavitt Blasts Jen Psaki’s ‘Prayer’ Comment; Gives Big Probe Update

Musk’s Long History with Trans Ideology



Musk’s Son Transitioned: Vivian Jenna Wilson



The Shooter’s Identity and Politics



Right-Wing Reactions



Event Summary



Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and owner of X, recently took to the platform to attack CNN for allegedly “refusing” to identify the Minneapolis shooter as transgender. Musk quote-tweeted a user noting that CNN’s report did not mention the shooter’s gender identity and added: “CNN is deeply infected with the woke mind virus. ” His remark once again placed him at the centre of America’s culture war, ensuring that the aftermath of the Minneapolis tragedy became as much about media narratives as the attack itself.Authorities later confirmed that 23-year-old Robin Westman, the gunman responsible for the attack at Annunciation Catholic School, identified as transgender. Whether that fact is relevant to the motive remains uncertain, but its omission in some early reports has fuelled debate. Critics accused newsrooms of ideological bias, while others argued that highlighting the detail risks further marginalising trans people.Musk’s commentary reflects his long-running hostility to what he calls “woke ideology.” Over the years, he has mocked pronoun use, derided protections for trans people, and pledged to oppose gender-affirming care for minors. His position has often sparked criticism from activists and employees alike, but he has remained defiant, presenting himself as a defender of “common sense” against progressive overreach.Musk’s stance has also drawn attention because of his personal history. His eldest child, once known as Xavier Musk, transitioned in 2020 and is now legally recognised as Vivian Jenna Wilson. She chose her mother’s surname and sought to sever ties with her father, citing his attitudes towards her identity. In later interviews, Vivian described struggling with Musk’s dismissive views and his distance as a parent, while embracing her own voice as a young trans woman. Their estrangement has become a symbolic subplot in Musk’s wider war against trans ideology.Westman’s broader profile paints a picture of confusion and rage rather than clear ideology. His weapons were daubed with hateful slogans: anti-Catholic, anti-India, anti-Israel and anti-Trump messages jumbled together alongside crude internet graffiti. Investigators believe his worldview was less a political doctrine than a chaotic reflection of extremist online spaces.Many right-wing and MAGA-aligned voices quickly seized on the shooter’s transgender identity to frame the tragedy through culture-war lenses.House GOP Whip Tom Emmer demanded the repeal of Minnesota’s ""trans refuge"" law, claiming it encouraged confusion among youth and undermined parental rights. He also called for the FBI to classify the shooting as both a hate crime and an act of domestic terrorism.On the fringes, commentators tied to conspiracy-driven platforms portrayed media coverage of the shooter’s gender identity as a “victory” for independent journalism—though even some on their side cautioned that such rhetoric was callous so soon after the deaths of children.The response reflected a broader pattern: instead of focusing primarily on gun access or security lapses, much of the right turned the spotlight onto gender ideology. Musk’s own intervention amplified this reaction, making the shooter’s trans identity central to the political fallout.The reality of the attack itself was grim. On Wednesday morning, Westman approached the Annunciation Catholic School during a back-to-school Mass and opened fire through the stained-glass windows with a rifle, a shotgun and a pistol—all purchased legally. Two children, aged eight and ten, were killed. Seventeen others, including 14 classmates and three elderly parishioners, were wounded. Westman later died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Police Chief Brian O’Hara called the act “absolutely incomprehensible,” while Mayor Jacob Frey said the children “should be able to pray and play in peace.” The school year had opened with the theme “A future filled with hope.” Instead, Annunciation’s shattered windows now stand as testimony to another American community devastated by gun violence.","Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and owner of X, recently took to the platform to attack CNN for allegedly “refusing” to identify the Minneapolis shooter as transgender.

Han faces rebellion allegations



Former First Lady accused of political corruption



Martial law plot



South Korea’s former first lady, Kim Keon Hee, and ex-prime minister Han Duck-soo were indicted Friday in a high-profile investigation linked to the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol. The charges include abetting the controversial December martial law declaration, bribery, and manipulation of political party nominations, escalating scrutiny of Yoon’s administration.Han, who served as acting leader after Yoon’s impeachment in mid-December, was charged with abetting the martial law declaration, which prosecutors say amounted to rebellion. He also faces charges of falsifying and destroying official documents and lying under oath.Assistant special counsel Park Ji-young said the ex- prime minister was the highest official who could have blocked Yoon’s plan. Park told a televised briefing that Han still played an “active” role in the declaration by trying to have the decree passed through a Cabinet Council meeting to give it “procedural legitimacy.” Han, however, maintains he conveyed to Yoon that he opposed the plan.Han later resigned from his caretaker post to pursue the presidential nomination, but the conservative People Power Party chose another candidate.Kim, the jailed former president’s wife, was charged with violating financial market and political funding laws and receiving bribes, two weeks after a court ordered her arrest. She and Yoon are also suspected of exerting undue influence on the People Power Party to nominate a specific candidate in a 2022 legislative by-election, allegedly at the request of election broker Myung Tae-kyun. Myung faces accusations of conducting free opinion surveys with manipulated data that may have helped Yoon win the party’s presidential primaries.Earlier this month, Kim apologized for causing public concern but suggested she would deny the charges, portraying herself as “someone insignificant.”Yoon was removed from office in April and rearrested last month in connection with the martial law decree. His defense minister, military commanders, and police officers have also been arrested for their roles. Three special prosecutor investigations, launched under liberal President Lee Jae Myung, have focused on Yoon’s presidency and the December martial law declaration.","Kim Keon Hee and ex-prime minister Han Duck-soo indicted in high-profile investigation.

In a major development of the H-1B row, the US President Donald Trump-led administration is taking action against companies which are discriminating against American workers.The programme, which allows foreign workers to fill roles in the US, has long been criticised for limiting opportunities for native-born Americans.Assistant attorney general for Civil Rights, Harmeet Dhillon, confirmed to Patrick Reports that the department of justice’s (DoJ) civil rights division is actively investigating civil rights complaints linked to the H-1B programme.“Through our Protecting US Workers Initiative, the Civil Rights Division’s Immigrant and Employee Rights section has numerous open investigations into hiring practices that discriminate against American citizens, and the list continues to grow,” InfoWars quoted Dhillon.She further added, “We encourage anyone aware of such practices to notify the Civil Rights Division so we can determine if an investigation and enforcement action is needed.”The Indian-American Trump aide took to social media platform X calling out people to send leads against employers.“We have several open investigations and have taken action against some employers already! Send us your leads!”Dhillon has long criticized the H-1B system.""The H1B system is broken and needs reform. What does that have to do with medical education? Nothing, and it’s lazy to conflate the two broken systems,"" she had said earlier.The H-1B visa programme is capped at 85,000 new visas per year, excluding renewals for existing holders. Workers on these visas are often dependent on their employers for legal status, allowing companies to treat them more harshly than American employees and giving them an advantage in the hiring process.The Trump-era department of labour (DOL) also faced scrutiny from the Office of Inspector General over its handling of H-2B applications.While critics argue that the system continues to favour foreign workers, the DOJ’s renewed focus on protecting American employees offers a potential turning point. Citizen activists and job-seekers are now calling for continued pressure to ensure cases of H-1B-related discrimination are prosecuted and legal precedents are set to protect non-visa workers.","The US President Donald Trump-led administration is taking action against companies which are discriminating against American workers.

What next?





US President Donald Trump on Friday said that he would ""fight back"" after a US federal court in a significant ruling found his global tariffs ""illegal.""The US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington ruled that many of Trump's tariffs were illegal; however, it allowed them to remain in place for now, giving the US president time to take the matter to the Supreme Court.A furious Trump termed the court ruling ""incorrect,"" saying that ""ALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT!""""Today, a Highly Partisan Appeals Court incorrectly said that our Tariffs should be removed, but they know the United States of America will win in the end,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Blown by the decision, Trump flagged that if tariffs ever went away, it would be a ""total disaster"" for US, adding that the country ""will no longer tolerate enormous Trade Deficits and unfair Tariffs and Non-Tariff Trade Barriers imposed by other Countries, friend or foe.""""The USA will no longer tolerate enormous Trade Deficits and unfair Tariffs and Non-Tariff Trade Barriers imposed by other Countries, friend or foe, that undermine our Manufacturers, Farmers, and everyone else,"" he added.""If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,"" Trump wrote further.The US president underlined that the tariffs imposed by him on several countries, which resulted in a trade war, are ""best tool"" for US workers and ""support Companies that produce great MADE IN AMERICA products.""Trump said that for many years tariffs were used against US but now he will approach Supreme Court to make America ""Rich, Strong, and Powerful Again.""The 7-4 ruling by the US court observed: ""The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax,"" as quoted by Reuters.The decision also noted that the US president had exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).Federal court's ruling has thrown a roadblock to Trump's path after he audaciously claimed unlimited power to bypass Congress and imposed tariffs on several countries, friends and foes.The decision was centred on tariffs Trump imposed on almost every country on earth on April 2, calling it 'Liberation Day,' as well as levies on China, Mexico, and Canada.The court stated that he overstepped when he declared national emergencies to justify imposing tariffs on several countries.If tariffs are struck down, the US administration argued that it will have to refund some of the import taxes that were collected. It will be a major financial blow for US treasury. According to news report from AP, by July the revenue from tariffs totalled to $159 billion, more than expected. The justice department earlier had said that revoking the tariffs could mean ""financial ruin"" for America.""While existing trade deals may not automatically unravel, the administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy, which may embolden foreign governments to resist future demands, delay implementation of prior commitments, or even seek to renegotiate terms,"" Ashley Akers, a former justice department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court decision, as quoted by AP.Meanwhile, Trump declared on his social media platform that he will take the fight to the Supreme Court. ""If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,"" he wrote.While the president still has other legal tools to levy import taxes, they are far more limited. The Trade Act of 1974, for example, allows tariffs of only up to 15% and for a maximum of 150 days against countries with which the U.S. runs large trade deficits.Another option is Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 — the basis for past tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos. But that route requires a formal Commerce Department investigation and cannot be triggered at the president’s discretion.","US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington ruled that many of Trump's tariffs were illegal.

India’s ‘Befitting Response’ To Trump’s 50% Tariffs; Sets Russian Oil 'Import Record' | Report





A US federal appeals court on Friday ruled that most tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump under emergency powers were illegal, striking at the heart of his trade policy and setting up a likely battle in the Supreme Court The ruling by the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington, DC, covered two sets of tariffs - Trump’s “reciprocal” duties imposed in April as part of his trade war and another set announced in February against China, Canada and Mexico. It does not affect other tariffs Trump imposed under separate statutes, including those on steel and aluminum imports.In a 7-4 judgement the court observed: “The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax,” as quoted by Reuters.The decision also said Trump had exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).Trump had invoked IEEPA, a 1977 law historically used for sanctions and asset freezes, to justify tariffs by declaring a national emergency over persistent US trade deficits and cross-border drug flows. The administration argued that the law’s power to “regulate” imports extended to tariffs.The appeals court rejected that view, saying: “It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs. The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President’s power to impose tariffs.”The appeals court put its ruling on hold until October 14, allowing the Trump administration time to seek a reversal from the Supreme Court.Minutes after the ruling, President Donald Trump sharply criticised the judgement, saying if allowed it would be a “ total disaster for the Country”.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, he attacked the appeals courts as ""Highly Partisan"" and asserted that the Supreme Court would rule in his favour.“If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country,” Trump wrote in his post. “If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America.”“The President’s tariffs remain in effect, and we look forward to ultimate victory on this matter,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a separate statement, as quoted by CNBC.Trump has relied heavily on tariffs in his second term, using them as a central tool of US foreign policy to pressure trading partners and push for revised trade agreements. While the duties have helped his administration secure economic concessions, they have also added to uncertainty in financial markets.The lawsuits were filed separately by five small US businesses and a coalition of 12 Democratic-led states, who argued that under the Constitution, the power to issue taxes and tariffs lies with Congress and any delegation of that authority must be both explicit and limited.Trump had defended the tariffs as a way to rebalance global trade and protect US industries. He said the April tariffs were necessary because the US had imported more than it exported for decades, undermining manufacturing and military readiness.He also said the February tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico were justified because those countries were not doing enough to curb the flow of illegal fentanyl into the US - an assertion those governments have denied.The New York-based US Court of international trade had earlier ruled against Trump’s tariff policies on May 28, saying the president had exceeded his powers when imposing both sets of challenged tariffs. That three-judge panel included one judge appointed by Trump during his first term. Another court in Washington also found that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs, with the government appealing that decision.According to Reuters, at least eight lawsuits have been filed against Trump’s tariff measures, including one brought by the state of California.While the latest decision restricts tariffs imposed under IEEPA, it leaves intact those imposed under other legal authorities. The Justice Department is expected to appeal, with the case likely headed to the US Supreme Court.","US federal appeals court rules that most tariffs imposed by president Donald Trump under emergency powers were illegal.

What is Pocket Rescission? Trump uses rare loophole to freeze $4.9 bn aid — Congress can’t stop it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-pocket-rescission-trump-uses-rare-loophole-to-freeze-4-9-bn-aid-congress-cant-stop-it/articleshow/123588504.cms,"Target: State department and USAID

A clash with Congress

What it means





President Donald Trump has told House Speaker Mike Johnson he will not spend $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid, invoking a little-used budgetary maneuver that hasn’t been deployed in nearly half a century.In a letter sent Thursday to Johnson, R-La., and later posted on the White House Office of Management and Budget’s X account, Trump announced he was using a “pocket rescission” - a tactic that allows the president to let funding quietly lapse at the end of the fiscal year. Because Congress has just 45 days to act on such a request, submitting it in late August effectively ensures the money goes unspent when the fiscal year closes on September 30.The last time a president used the tool was in 1977, under Jimmy Carter. Trump’s decision marks a significant escalation in his efforts to cut foreign aid, raising fresh questions about the balance of power between the executive branch and Congress when it comes to federal spending.The $4.9 billion in frozen funding was earmarked for the State Department and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), both of which have been frequent targets of Trump’s budget cuts.USAID itself has already been dismantled under his administration, with its remaining programs folded into the State Department.Earlier this year, Trump announced plans to eliminate nearly all foreign assistance contracts, a move that critics warned could devastate global food and health programs. His administration is also appealing to the Supreme Court to halt lower court rulings that preserved foreign aid for global health, including HIV and AIDS programs.Under the 1974 Impoundment Control Act, presidents may propose rescinding funds, but lawmakers ultimately decide whether the money is clawed back. By timing his request so late in the fiscal calendar, Trump has ensured lawmakers can’t act before the funds expire — a maneuver that could, if repeated, shift significant spending power away from Congress.Congress did approve Trump’s earlier rescission request in July, cutting $9 billion in foreign aid and public broadcasting funds. But his latest move sidesteps congressional approval entirely.Supporters say the maneuver is legal and long overdue, while critics argue it undermines congressional authority and risks U.S. credibility abroad. With billions in aid for health, food, and development now in limbo, foreign governments and relief agencies are bracing for ripple effects.","The $4.9 billion in frozen funding was earmarked for the State Department and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), both of which have been frequent targets of Trump's budget cuts.

US health officials have raised a travel alert for China’s Guangdong province after a surge in cases of chikungunya, a mosquito-borne illness known to cause prolonged joint pain.According to the New York Post, the center for disease control and prevention (CDC) has issued a Level 2 travel warning, advising visitors to “practice enhanced precautions” when visiting the region. Foshan city has been identified as the epicentre of the outbreak, prompting containment steps that some compare to early COVID-era measures.Thousands of people in China have been infected, the report said. Chikungunya is spread through the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes in warm, humid climates, but not through person-to-person contact. While rarely fatal, the illness can cause intense joint pain lasting weeks, months or even years.The CDC has urged travellers to protect themselves by using EPA-registered insect repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothing, avoiding mosquito breeding sites, and staying in screened or air-conditioned accommodations. Two vaccines against chikungunya have recently been approved for use in the United States, but pregnant women - particularly those nearing delivery - are advised to reconsider travel as the virus can, in rare cases, be transmitted during childbirth.Globally, an estimated 35 million people contract chikungunya each year, though annual deaths are relatively low at around 3,700. In the US, 46 travel-related cases have been reported so far in 2025, compared with nearly 200 in 2024. No locally transmitted cases have been recorded in the country since 2019, according to the CDC.Older adults, newborns, and people with chronic health conditions remain at greater risk of severe or long-term complications from the illness, the agency added.","Thousands of people in China have been infected, the report said.

Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst will not seek a third term in 2026, according to two sources familiar with her decision, CNN reported. The 55-year-old senator is expected to make a formal announcement next week, setting the stage for a competitive open-seat race in a key Midwestern state.Representative Ashley Hinson, a fellow Iowa Republican, is preparing to enter the race, a GOP official told the portal. National Republicans have long viewed Hinson as a strong contender, anticipating Ernst's potential retirement.On the Democratic side, the field is already crowded. Primary candidates include state Representative Josh Turek, a Paralympian wheelchair basketball player, state Senator Zach Wahls, Knoxville chamber of commerce executive director Nathan Sage, and Des Moines School board chair Jackie Norris.First elected in 2014, Ernst gained national attention with her ""Make 'em squeal"" slogan promising to cut government spending. However, she has occasionally faced criticism - most notably when she told a constituent concerned about Medicaid cuts, ""we are all going to die,"" during a town hall.Ernst has struggled at times to navigate the political divide within the Republican party between traditional conservatives and Trump-aligned voters. While Iowa has shifted rightward in recent cycles - with Trump winning the state by 8 points in 2020 and 13 points in 2024 - recent Democratic wins in special elections have prompted renewed optimism within the party.Democrats need to flip four Senate seats in the 2026 midterms to regain control. While their main target remains an open-seat race in North Carolina, they are also eyeing opportunities in Iowa, Ohio, Maine, and Texas.","The 55-year-old senator is expected to make a formal announcement next week, setting the stage for a competitive open-seat race in a key Midwestern state.

Passengers on an American Airlines flight to Miami were left stunned when a violent altercation erupted in the aisle during disembarkation, a shocking scene caught on video and now circulating online.Footage obtained by TMZ from Flight 2249 shows a man allegedly grabbing a woman by the neck and shoving her backward as passengers prepared to exit. Within seconds, another traveler rushed to intervene, setting off a brawl in the cramped aisle.The man accused of choking the woman then turned on the would-be rescuer, shoving him into a row of seats while shouting, “Don’t you grab me like that.” Screams of shock and anger erupted from fellow passengers.“What the f--- are you doin’?” one woman yelled, demanding the man’s arrest. Another passenger, trying to get off the plane, shouted, “Somebody needs to get this man.

Sikh man shot dead in LA: What prompted cops to take deadly action; was 'screaming and swinging at cars',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sikh-man-shot-dead-in-la-what-prompted-cops-to-take-deadly-action-was-screaming-and-swinging-at-cars/articleshow/123587420.cms,"Central Area OIS 7/13/25 (NRF034-25)





A newly released LAPD police video has shed light on the fatal shooting of a 35-year-old Sikh man by the police, raising questions about what led officers to open fire in the busy downtown area.The incident unfolded on the morning of 13 July this year, near the bustling intersection of Figueroa Street and Olympic Boulevard, close to Crypto.com Arena. Multiple 911 callers reported a man waving a machete, blocking traffic and threatening passers-by. Callers described him as “a guy with a machete … screaming and swinging at cars” and “running towards people” in the middle of the street. They further added that the man looked Indian.Police later identified the man as Gurpreet Singh, a resident of Arcadia. Singh, wearing a blue headscarf, abandoned his black Dodge Challenger in the middle of the road, and, according to LAPD, appeared to be performing Gatka, a traditional Sikh martial art, while brandishing the large blade.At one point, officers said, he even appeared to slice his own tongue with the weapon.The LAPD Media Relations Division released the department’s critical incident community briefing, narrated by lieutenant Bruce CS.“This critical incident community briefing is intended to provide you with information about an officer involved shooting that occurred in central division in the city of Los Angeles,” he said, adding that the investigation was still in its early stages and could take up to a year.Video evidence showed officers arriving at the scene and repeatedly ordering Singh to drop the machete. Instead, Singh walked back to his car, threw a water bottle at officers, then sped away, waving the weapon out of the driver’s window.“The officers redeployed and began to give Singh verbal commands to stop and drop the machete. However, Singh did not comply with the officer's commands, returned to his Dodge Challenger, retrieved a water bottle, and threw it at officers. He then entered his Dodge Challenger and drove away southbound on Figueroa Street while waving the machete outside the driver's side window.”Officers said that Singh then stopped, got out of his vehicle, still armed, and charged at them. At that moment, they discharged both a 40mm less-lethal foam projectile and live rounds. “Shots fired. Officer needs help,” one officer is heard shouting on body-worn camera footage. Singh was struck, dropped the machete, and fell to the ground.Officers immediately requested medical aid and attempted life-saving measures before paramedics arrived. Singh was taken to hospital but succumbed to his injuries on 17 July 2025. A machete measuring 27 inches with a blade nearly 22 inches long was recovered from the scene.No officers or civilians were injured during the ordeal. The LAPD stressed that it had not yet reached any conclusions about whether the officers’ actions complied with department policy.“We are still at the very early stages of this investigation, which can often take up to a year to complete. and our understanding of the incident may change as this additional evidence is collected, analyzed, and reviewed,” Bruce CS said.","Gurpreet Singh, 35, appeared to be performing Gatka, a traditional Sikh martial art, while brandishing the large blade.

INDORE: A missing case in Indore that kept police and family members on edge for nearly a week took a dramatic turn with a twist straight out of a film script.Twenty-two-year-old Shraddha Tiwari, who went missing from her home on August 23, returned on Friday morning, but not alone. She arrived at MIG police station with a man named Karan Yogi, claiming he was now her husband.Shraddha stated that she initially stepped out of her house to meet her boyfriend, Sarthak Gehlot. But, when he failed to turn up at railway station where they had planned to meet, she boarded a train to Ratlam in anger.There, she allegedly attempted to end her life by jumping off the moving train, but was stopped by Karan, an old acquaintance who once worked as an electrician at the college where Shraddha studied, said MIG police station in charge CB Singh.Singh said that Karan told them that when he stopped Shraddha, she told him that if he really wanted to save her, he should marry her.He agreed and the two went on a tour to Khargone and then Maheshwar, where they exchanged vows in a temple. Later, they went to Karan's family home in Palia, but after facing opposition from his relatives, they reached Mandsaur before finally returning to Indore.Singh said, ""While the story seems fabricated since she is not a minor, she can marry anyone.It is suspected that she knew Karan beforehand.""Additional DCP Amrendra Singh said that the case has been closed. The story has sparked controversy within Shraddha's family. Her father, Anil Tiwari, has questioned the sudden turn of events, claiming that his daughter has been trapped in a situation she did not willingly accept. He counselled her for over three hours in front of Singh, but she did not agree to go back home with him.Police officials confirmed that Shraddha is safe and that she legally married Karan at a temple. CCTV footage earlier showed her walking near her house before she disappeared, and suspicion initially fell on Sarthak, who was called in for questioning. He, however, claimed that the two had not spoken in the last fifteen days due to family opposition.Shraddha's disappearance created panic in her family, who even hung her photograph upside down outside their home, mimicking Sonam Raghuwanshi's family, who had also done the same after she and Raja went missing, following a local belief that such a ritual brings a missing person back.They also announced a reward of Rs 51,000 for anyone who helped find her.","Twenty-two-year-old Shraddha Tiwari, who went missing from her home on August 23, returned on Friday morning.

"Microsoft terminates 4 employees for Israel-related protests, group claims fired employees received voicemails saying ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-terminates-4-employees-for-israel-related-protests-group-claims-fired-employees-received-voicemails-saying-/articleshow/123578659.cms,"What Microsoft said on firing of employees

Why workers protested at Microsoft building

Microsoft has fired two more employees – Nisreen Jardat and Julius Shan for a sit-in protest at President Brad Smith’s office against the software giant’s business ties to Israel. The protest, organised by No Azure for Apartheid demanded Microsoft to terminate its ties with Israel and offer reparations to Palestine. The development comes a day after the company fired two workers – Riki Fameli and Anna Hattle after participating in the protest, taking the total number of employees fired by Microsoft to four. According to a Reuters report, Anna Hattle and Riki Fameli received voicemails informing them that they were fired. Microsoft said the employees were terminated “due to serious violations of established company policies and our code of conduct,” including the sit-in that “created significant safety concerns for our employees.”Members of No Azure for Apartheid shared a post on X (formerly Twitter), informing about the latest termination. In a press conference on August 28, the group said that the firings were an attempt to silence workers’ voices. The activist group said Microsoft misrepresented its protest, further accusing the company of bringing in security and police, which made the situation worse.Redmond police arrested seven people during August 26’s sit-in on charges of trespassing, resisting arrest, and obstruction.Microsoft issued a statement when it fired Riki Fameli and Anna Hattle on August 27. However, there is no update from the company on the latest firing of Nisreen Jardat and Julius Shan.Announcing the termination of the employees, the company then said:“Two employees were terminated today following serious breaches of company policies and our code of conduct. The first violated the Business Conduct Policy, participated in the unlawful break-in at the executive offices, and other demonstrations on campus, and was arrested by authorities on our premises on two occasions. The second was involved in the break-in at the executive offices and was subsequently arrested. These incidents are inconsistent with the expectations we maintain for our employees. The company is continuing to investigate and is cooperating fully with law enforcement regarding these matters.”The group No Azure for Apartheid, named after Microsoft’s Azure software, has called on the company to cut ties with Israel and provide financial aid to Palestinians. A joint media investigation by The Guardian, +972 Magazine, and Local Call reported that the Azure software is used by an Israeli military surveillance agency. The investigation goes on to claim that the agency utilized Azure to store recordings of phone calls made by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza and for the broader surveillance of Palestinians.""We are here because Microsoft continues to provide Israel with the tools it needs to commit genocide while gaslighting and misdirecting its own workers about this reality,"" Hattle said in a statement.","Microsoft has fired two more employees for a sit-in protest at President Brad Smith’s office.

Tariff-hit BRICS Nation Leader Shames Trump’s Naval Buildup In US Backyard | ‘Using Force Illegally’





Hours before a US federal appeals court declared most of President Donald Trump’s global tariffs illegal, rejecting his use of emergency powers to impose duties, his cabinet secretaries filed statements in court, warning of serious implications of ruling on US foreign policy, and leaving Washington red faced diplomatically, reported Bloomberg.The ruling by the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington, DC, said the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize a president to levy tariffs. “The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax,” the judges said.The decision invalidates Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs announced in April and another set imposed in February on China, Canada and Mexico. It does not affect tariffs issued under other legal authorities, such as those on steel and aluminum imports.The court’s ruling came just hours after urgent statements filed by multiple members of Trump’s cabinet urging judges to delay any decision until the US Supreme Court rules.Treasury secretary Scott Bessent warned of “dangerous diplomatic embarrassment,” while commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said a ruling against the administration without a stay would have “devastating and dire consequences,” as quoted by the news portal.Lutnick argued tariffs had brought foreign powers to the negotiating table “in ways that no other president came close to achieving,” and cautioned that striking them down would “send a signal to the world that the United States lacks the resolve to defend its own economic and national security.”“Suspending the effectiveness of the tariffs would expose the United States to the risk of retaliation by other countries based on a perception that the United States lacks the capacity to respond rapidly to retaliation,” Bessent added..Secretary of state Marco Rubio added that Trump had invoked tariff powers during sensitive talks, including efforts to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, warning of “severe consequences for ongoing peace negotiations and human rights abuses.”During oral arguments on July 31, federal circuit judges expressed skepticism over the administration’s sweeping claims of tariff authority, raising the possibility they could side with lawsuits brought by small businesses and Democratic-led states. The administration’s last moment filing indicated concern about that very outcome.Trump had justified his tariffs under IEEPA by declaring national emergencies over trade deficits and drug trafficking, but the appeals court rejected this interpretation. “It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,” the ruling said.The lawsuits were brought by small businesses and a coalition of Democratic-led states, who argued tariff power rests with Congress. The New York-based US court of international trade had already ruled against Trump’s tariffs in May, finding he had exceeded his authority.The federal circuit has now paused the effect of its decision until October 14, giving the administration time to appeal to the US Supreme Court.","US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington, DC, said the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize a president to levy tariffs.

A Jewish woman in her 70s was stabbed in broad daylight at a supermarket in Ottawa. The shocking incident took place Wednesday afternoon at a Loblaws store on Baseline Road, where the victim was shopping with a friend.Ottawa Police Service confirmed Friday that the assault is being investigated as a 'hate-motivated' crime.Police said the attacker, who did not know her, approached and stabbed her without provocation.

‘You can’t mimic the king’: JD Vance again mocks Gavin Newsom’s Donald Trump-style posts; calls it ‘cheap imitation’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/you-cant-mimic-the-king-jd-vance-again-mocks-gavin-newsoms-donald-trump-style-posts-calls-it-cheap-imitation/articleshow/123580503.cms,"JD Vance again mocks Gavin Newsom’s Donald Trump-style posts (Picture credit: AP)

The Chaos That Erupted Just Moments Before Vance Was Booed At Union Station Revealed





US Vice President JD Vance has again criticised California Governor Gavin Newsom’s new social media strategy, saying his attempt to copy President Donald Trump ’s style lacks authenticity.In an interview with Fox News host Will Cain, Vance argued that Newsom cannot replicate Trump’s appeal. “He's trying to be a fake copy of Trump and it just doesn't work. You can't mimic the king. You can’t mimic the master; you ought to just go and be yourself. And I think the people would like that a lot more than a cheap imitation of the president of the United States,” he said.The comments follow a string of posts from Newsom’s press office in August that mirrored Trump’s online persona — using capital letters, mocking nicknames and emphatic sign-offs.One viral post declared, “WOW! TOMORROW HISTORY WILL BE MADE… DONALD ‘THE FAILURE’ TRUMP BE WARNED, TOMORROW MAY BE THE WORST DAY OF YOUR LIFE. LIBERATION DAY FOR AMERICA!!! — GCN.”Cain noted that the approach may be resonating with Democrats, pointing to a Morning Consult poll showing Newsom’s support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents rose by eight points between June and late August.However, Vance dismissed the tactic as inauthentic. “When I see Gavin Newsom trying to act like Donald Trump, that’s the opposite of authenticity.He’s not trying to be Gavin Newsom — whoever that is. He’s trying to be a fake carbon copy of Donald Trump, and it just doesn’t work,” he said.Vance emphasised that Trump’s enduring influence comes from being genuine. “The lesson of President Trump in American politics is you’ve got to be authentic to yourself,” he added. “People liked his posts because they spoke to his authenticity. With Newsom, it’s a cheap replication.”Newsom defended his approach earlier this month, saying he wanted to highlight the double standards around Trump’s social media behaviour. “I’m sort of following his example,” he said in a press conference, according to The Wrap. “If you’ve got issues with what I’m putting out, you sure as hell should have concerns about what he’s putting out as president.”In an earlier interview, Vance has also warned Democrats more broadly against drawing the wrong lesson from Trump’s success. “This idea that Gavin Newsom is somehow going to mimic Donald Trump’s style — I think that ignores the fundamental genius of President Trump’s political success, which is that he’s authentic,” he said on Fox News’s The Ingraham Angle.Vance went further, offering blunt advice, “The autopsy for the Democrats… is stop sounding like crazy people. Don’t be a crazy person. Be authentic.”","JD Vance again mocks Gavin Newsom’s Donald Trump-style posts. ‘He's trying to be a fake copy of Trump and it just doesn't work.

A dramatic police video has captured the moments before a 35-year-old Sikh man, wielding a machete near Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles was fatally shot by officers in July this year.The incident took place on the morning of July 13, when multiple 911 callers reported a man brandishing a large blade at passersby at the busy intersection of Figueroa Street and Olympic Boulevard.Police later identified him as Gurpreet Singh LAPD released footage of the incident on its YouTube channel yesterday, where Singh is seen apparently performing G, a traditional Sikh martial art, in the middle of the street.According to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), Singh abandoned his car in the middle of the road, waved the machete aggressively and, at one point, even appeared to slice his own tongue with the weapon.Officers said they repeatedly ordered him to drop the blade, but he refused to comply.Singh briefly returned to his vehicle, retrieved a water bottle and hurled it at police before driving off while sticking the machete out of the window. Officers launched a short pursuit during which Singh allegedly drove erratically and collided with a police vehicle.He finally came to a stop near Figueroa and 12th Streets, where police said he charged at them with the weapon. Officers opened fire, striking Singh.He was rushed to hospital but later succumbed to his injuries.The LAPD said a two-foot-long machete was recovered from the scene. No officers or civilians were hurt in the ordeal.","LA Police shoot dead Sikh man performing gatka on LA road.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has revoked the visas of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and 80 other officials ahead of next month's annual high-level meeting of the UN General Assembly, where the Palestinians previously have been represented.A State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss visa issues that are normally confidential, disclosed Friday that Abbas and other officials from the Palestinian Authority were among those affected.The move is the latest in a series of steps the Trump administration has taken to target Palestinians with visa restrictions and comes as the Israeli military declared Gaza's largest city a combat zone. The State Department also suspended a program that had allowed injured Palestinian children from Gaza to come to the US for medical treatment after a social media outcry by some conservatives.The department said in a statement earlier that Rubio also ordered some new visa applications from Palestinian officials, including those tied to the Palestine Liberation Organisation, be denied.""It is in our national security interests to hold the PLO and PA accountable for not complying with their commitments, and for undermining the prospects for peace,"" the statement said.It said that to be considered partners for peace the groups ""must consistently repudiate terrorism, and end incitement to terrorism in education, as required by US law and as promised by the PLO.""The State Department didn't specify how many visas had been revoked or how many applications had been denied or give details beyond its statement.The Palestinian Authority denounced the visa withdrawals as a violation of US commitments as the host country of the United Nations and urged the State Department to reverse its decision.It said in a statement that the Palestinian presidency ""expressed its deep regret and astonishment"" at the visa decision, which ""contravenes international law and the Headquarters Agreement, especially since the State of Palestine is an observer member of the United Nations.""UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the world body would be seeking clarification from the State Department.""We obviously hope that this will be resolved,"" he said. ""It is important that all member states, permanent observers be able to be represented.""The State Department said representatives assigned to the Palestinian Authority mission at the United Nations would be granted waivers under the US host country agreement with the U.N. so they can continue their New York-based operations.The Palestinian ambassador to the UN, Riyad Mansour, told reporters Friday that Abbas planned to lead the delegation to the UN meetings and was expected to address the General Assembly - as he has done for many years.He also was expected to attend a high-level meeting co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia on September 22 about a two-state solution, which calls for Israel living side-by-side with an independent Palestine.","Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is among those affected, a State Department official says.

Trump surrogates on Friday kept up a relentless attack on New Delhi for purportedly fuelling Russia's war against Ukraine, shaking US-India ties in a manner not seen in more than 50 years amid growing concern outside MAGA-sphere.From accusing India of being a ""laundromat for Kremlin"" (WH trade counselor Peter Navarro) to alleging New Delhi and its Brics allies are somehow responsible for Russia's latest bombing of Kyiv in which 23 people died (Senator Lindsey Graham), Trump minions continued to savage India amid pushback from former US officials, think tanks, advocacy groups, and Democrat lawmakers seeking to arrest the slide.""India, China, Brazil and others who prop up Putin's war machine by buying cheap Russian oil: How do you feel right now that your purchases have resulted in innocent civilians, including children, being killed?"" South Carolina Senator and Trump minion Lindsey Graham wrote on X hours after the the latest bombing in Kyiv that killed 23, warning, with reference to the 50% tariff on New Delhi, ""India is experiencing the cost of supporting Putin. To the rest, you will soon too.""It was Graham, widely seen as a warmonger even in Republican circles, who triggered the Trump tariffs on India by introducing the ""Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025"" which, among other things, proposed a 500% tariff on nations buying Russian energy. While Russia, China, and EU have since been treated with kid gloves, India inexplicably has borne the brunt of Graham's ire.In a series of vituperative posts following up his characterisation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict as ""Modi's war,"" Graham's White House pointman Peter Navarro accused India of ""using our dollars"" to ""bankroll"" Russia and said New Delhi's buying of Russian oil ""carries an added price of blood and devastation in Ukraine.""""It doesn't stop there. India continues to buy Russian weapons - while demanding that US firms transfer sensitive military tech and build plants in India. That's strategic freeloading,"" Navarro said, adding, ""If India, the world's largest democracy, wants to be treated like a strategic partner of the US, it needs to act like one. The road to peace in Ukraine runs through New Delhi.""The comments came even as the US state department on Friday announced it will send 3,500 extended-range cruise missiles to Ukraine, a $825 million tab bankrolled by Europe and US, raising questions about their role in the bloodbath. By some accounts, it was US shenanigans in Ukraine that triggered the war.The virulence of the Graham-Navarro attacks - unchecked by the MAGA supremo - alarmed even conservative pundits outside the MAGA-sphere. ""Blow up our relationship with India over Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"" is proof we're in the dumbest timeline. Putin loves this. If this is what ""winning"" looks like, I'd rather lose,"" said Jeff Smith, director of the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank.The attacks on India even bothered the advocacy group American Jewish Committee to speak beyond its immediate remit. ""AJC is mystified, and deeply troubled, by the chorus of attacks on India by U.S. officials....We regret energy-hungry India's reliance on Russian oil - but India isn't responsible for Putin's war crimes, is a sister democracy and an increasingly important strategic partner of the US, and has a crucial role to play in Great Power competition. It's time to reset this vital relationship,"" it said.While supine Republican lawmakers, including many in the India caucus, remained silent, House Democrats blasted the administration for ""sabotaging US-India relations"".","Trump surrogates on Friday kept up a relentless attack on New Delhi for purportedly fuelling Russia's war against Ukraine.

Minneapolis gunman killed 2 children after breakup? Inside US shooter’s final days — ‘That scary horrible monster’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/minneapolis-gunman-killed-2-children-after-breakup-inside-us-shooters-final-days-that-scary-horrible-monster/articleshow/123592379.cms,"Breakup and family account

From heartbreak to hate

Community in shock





Minneapolis police say the gunman who killed two children and injured 18 others at Annunciation Catholic Church this week had recently gone through a breakup that may have played a role in his violent spiral.The suspect, identified as Robin Westman, 28, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after Wednesday’s attack, which unfolded as children attended mass during their first week of school.According to Fox9, Westman’s father told investigators his son had “recently broke up with a significant and/or romantic partner” and was staying with a friend in the aftermath. Police described the breakup as a destabilizing factor in his personal life, adding that Westman appeared increasingly isolated in the weeks leading up to the shooting.Records also show that in 2018, officers conducted a welfare check at the home of Westman’s mother involving him as a juvenile - an early sign of mental health concerns.Just hours before the attack, Westman uploaded a series of YouTube videos, including a manifesto where he described fantasies about “being that scary horrible monster standing over those powerless kids.” He also expressed admiration for the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre.In a letter addressed to family and friends, Westman apologized but insisted he still had “traits of empathy, self-sacrifice, and good character,” despite the violence he was about to unleash.On Wednesday morning, Westman fired through church windows at children and parishioners, then barricaded the doors with wooden planks. Minneapolis police chief Brian O’Hara called the act “one of the darkest tragedies imaginable,” as the community mourns the young lives lost and asks how personal turmoil escalated into mass violence.","The suspect, identified as Robin Westman, 28, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after Wednesday’s attack.

A joke that turned serious: Rubio exits USAID role; hands shutdown to Vought,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-joke-that-turned-serious-rubio-exits-usaid-role-hands-shutdown-to-vought/articleshow/123591154.cms,"Marco Rubio and Donalfd Trump (File - AP)





US secretary of state Marco Rubio on Friday announced he is stepping back from his role overseeing the US agency for international development (USAID), handing off responsibilities to office of management and budget director Russ Vought as the agency enters its final phase of shutdown.In a post on X, Rubio wrote congratulating Russ, “I joked with @realDonaldTrump that I had four jobs. He told me to give one to my friend Russ Vought. So I did,”“Since January, we’ve saved the taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. And with a small set of core programs moved over to the State Department, USAID is officially in close out mode,” he added. “Russ is now at the helm to oversee the closeout of an agency that long ago went off the rails. Congrats, Russ.”While the OMB has yet to confirm if Vought will serve as acting administrator of USAID or act in a designee role under Rubio, the move adds to his current portfolio, which includes heading the consumer financial protection bureau and leading Trump’s budget team.Vought also played a central role in shaping Project 2025, a conservative policy framework developed by The Heritage Foundation, according to Politico.USAID, once a key independent agency delivering international aid, has been gradually dismantled under the Trump administration. Earlier this year, President Trump appointed Rubio as acting administrator, and by March, 83% of its programmes - including those focused on food, water and medical aid - had been cut. The remaining functions were absorbed by the State Department on July 1.The restructuring followed a January executive order by Trump that froze a wide range of foreign and domestic aid programmes, targeting what the administration described as “woke” spending across federal agencies.More recently, in a letter sent Thursday to House Speaker Mike Johnson and later shared on the White House Office of Management and Budget’s X account, President Donald Trump said he was invoking a “pocket rescission” - a budgetary tool that lets the president allow allocated funds to expire without direct action. Since Congress has only 45 days to respond, Trump’s late August submission makes it nearly certain the funds will lapse unused when the fiscal year ends on September 30.There has been a consistent effort by the Trump administration to use the all possible tools at their disposal, like shutting down aid delivery agencies like USAID to pocket recession, along with other policy decision and recission proposals to substantially reduce the amount of money US spends on critical and humanitarian foreign aid, which they believe don't serve the purpose.","US secretary of state Marco Rubio announced he is stepping back from his role overseeing the US agency for international development (USAID) He handed off responsibilities to office of management and budget director Russ Vought.

"Spared prison after paralyzing newborn daughter, US man now accused of murdering infant son in twisted cover-up",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/spared-prison-after-paralyzing-newborn-daughter-us-man-now-accused-of-murdering-infant-son-in-twisted-cover-up-shocking-case-of-jake-haro/articleshow/123589623.cms,"The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department confirmed Emmanuel's parents, Jake and Rebecca, were arrested for murder.

A disturbing past ignored

Fake kidnapping, chilling confession

Outrage and unanswered questions





The story of Jake Haro reads like a nightmare. The 32-year-old California father, now accused of murdering his 7-month-old son Emmanuel, once beat a newborn daughter so viciously that she’s permanently bedridden with cerebral palsy — and yet, he never spent a day in prison, reported the New York Post.Back in 2018, Haro’s then 10-week-old daughter Carolina was hospitalized with brain injuries, fractured bones, and bleeding eyes. Doctors said she’d been brutally abused. Carolina survived but was left with irreversible damage, unable to walk or talk.But instead of locking him away, a judge suspended Haro’s six-year sentence, giving him six months in a work program and probation. Prosecutors now say that decision paved the way for tragedy.“Someone who does that to a child belongs in prison, period,” fumed Riverside County DA Mike Hestrin. “If that judge had done his job, Emmanuel would be alive today.”Earlier this month, Haro and his wife Rebecca, 41, claimed a stranger kidnapped Emmanuel outside a sporting goods store while Rebecca was changing his diaper. But detectives quickly realized the story was bogus, reported NYP.Days later, Haro allegedly confessed to an undercover inmate that he had killed his baby boy and tossed the body in a trash can. Officials fear Emmanuel may have already been dead for weeks, his short life ending in abuse just like his sister’s.Both Haro and his wife are being held on $1 million bail, but Emmanuel’s remains have still not been found. The case has sparked outrage over how a convicted child abuser could be spared prison, only to go on and allegedly kill again.","Jake Haro, 32, is accused of murdering his 7-month-old son Emmanuel.

JD Vance meltdown over Politico story: ‘Deep state laundering garbage into the conversation’; MAGA rallies behind,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-meltdown-over-politico-story-deep-state-laundering-garbage-into-the-conversation-maga-rallies-behind/articleshow/123588586.cms,"JD Vance (File - AP)





US Vice-President JD Vance has hit out at a recent Politico report critical of Steve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy in Russia-Ukraine talks, calling it “a foreign influence operation” aimed at discrediting the administration.Vance initially issued a formal response defending Witkoff, stating, “Witkoff has made more progress towards ending the bloodshed in Ukraine than all his critics combined.”But In a lengthy post on X, Vance accused the outlet of “journalistic malpractice” and said the article relied on anonymous sources to push an agenda. “Notice how all of the people attacking Steve are on background?” he wrote. “That means it's two or three deep staters who are angry that Witkoff has succeeded where they've failed.”The Politico story, published earlier in the day, quoted over a dozen unnamed officials who described Witkoff as inexperienced and ineffective in managing talks with Moscow. Vance pushed back, saying the piece omitted key on-record quotes from senior officials including himself, the secretary of state Marco Rubio, and Jared Kushner.He also referenced support for Witkoff from UK national security advisor Jonathan Powell, calling the article “disgraceful” and accusing its author, Felicia Schwartz, of either being used by anonymous operatives or complicit in what he termed a “literal foreign influence operation.”Defending Witkoff’s performance, Vance said, “The fruits of his negotiations are that we have narrowed the list of open issues in the Russia-Ukraine war to a set of clearly defined issues – specifically, security guarantees and territorial concessions.”He went on, “Maybe we make peace, and maybe we don’t. If we do, it will be because Steve Witkoff and the President of the United States worked their tails off, in the face of outright lies from the mainstream press.”Steve Witkoff thanked VP Vance for offering his very public defense of him,In a post on X, Witkoff wrote, “This statement from our amazing Vice President speaks for itself. Thank you Mr Vice President. It is my honor to serve in the Trump Administration.”The White House has not officially responded to the story, which comes amid heightened sensitivity around backchannel diplomacy efforts in Eastern Europe.Vance’s post triggered a wave of online abuse targeting Politico reporter Felicia Schwartz, with several pro-Trump social media users launching personal attacks. “With a name like ‘Fellatio’ and a face like this… i mean…” one user wrote, sharing an image of the journalist. Another responded, “You as VP can jail the journalist and I think it’s time. Put them in camps, sir.”Known Republican and MAGA social media accounts were quick to run down the Politico story and journalist, branding it as a smear campaign against Steve Witkoff, and alleging it to be solely based on fictional sources.","Vice-President JD Vance has hit out at a recent Politico report critical of Steve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy in Russia-Ukraine talks.
