Marvel Meets Maharashtra Politics, AI Reels On Civic Polls Turn Thanos, Hulk, Spider-Man Into Netas

PUNE: Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar acknowledged Tuesday that bitterness between the two factions of NCP has eased after they came together for Pune Municipal Corporation and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation elections, holding out hope for a possible patch-up with his uncle and party founder Sharad Pawar He denied holding talks with Sharad Pawar, 85, on a merger or continued alliance but left the door open. ""There has been no discussion with Pawar Saheb at all. However, I want to make it clear that there are no permanent enemies in politics,"" Ajit Pawar said in an interview to TOI.""People can make whatever inferences they want from my statement,"" he said. ""All I want to say is that I am a follower of Yashwantrao Chavan and I believe in the politics of addition, not subtraction.""Ajit Pawar, 66, and Sharad Pawar formally split in July 2023 when the nephew broke away with several MLAs and joined BJP -led state govt as deputy CM. The rupture followed an earlier, short-lived alignment with BJP in Nov 2019. Now, after months of acrimony that spilled into Lok Sabha and assembly campaigns last year, the two NCP groups have allied for key civic polls in Pune and neighbouring Pimpri-Chinchwad.Asked whether the alliance would extend beyond the municipal elections, Ajit Pawar said no decision had been taken but acknowledged its immediate impact.""When such an alliance happens, it automatically helps reduce the bitterness on both sides,"" he said, adding that neither group has traded barbs since the pact was sealed.Party workers were instrumental in bridging the divide. ""My section convinced me to ally with them. Similarly, workers from other group conveyed the same message to their seniors,"" he said. Ajit Pawar said he met the netas from Sharad Pawar camp, including Supriya Sule and Rohit Pawar, after which city units negotiated seat-sharing.The deputy CM said the contest in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, initially seen as tilted towards BJP, has tightened. ""Residents are not only listening to us but also responding positively,"" he said, contrasting it with the response he saw while campaigning for his wife Sunetra Pawar during the Lok Sabha elections.He credited the improved mood to the reunion of NCP base. ""NCP supporters have always given their first preference to Pawar Saheb. A section of them also likes my style of working,"" he said. ""When we split, our supporters were divided. Now... both sections have reunited.""Reflecting on his work ethic, Ajit Pawar traced it to his uncle's influence. ""I was in Class III when Pawar Saheb became an MLA,"" he said, recalling serving tea to visitors. ""I've been following the same principle in my political career for over three decades.""Responding to opposition allegations that NCP and BJP had made tacit adjustments by not forming alliances in PMC and PCMC, Ajit Pawar pushed back. ""There is no match-fixing between us,"" he said. ""They are trying to strengthen their party and I am trying the same for mine.""He said the decision for Mahayuti partners to contest separately in the two civic bodies was taken by CM Devendra Fadnavis, citing BJP's numerical strength in both corporations. ""Had talks of an alliance between BJP and Sena failed early, we would have probably got Eknath Shinde's party on our side in both civic bodies,"" he added.","Ajit Pawar, 66, and Sharad Pawar formally split in July 2023.

Shaksgam Valley Row Deepens As China Rejects India’s Claim And Defends CPEC Infra Project With Pak

NEW DELHI: BJP has raised several sticking points - ranging from border tensions to trade issues - in India-China ties in its interaction with a visiting Communist Party of China (CPC) delegation, emphasising that these were not helpful to their relations, as the two parties touched base after a gap of over six years amid signs of a possible thaw in the bilateral equation.The meeting on Monday with the Chinese delegation led by Sun Haiyan, vice minister of CPC's international liaison department, a senior rank in Beijing's foreign ministry hierarchy, was sought by the Chinese embassy here, and it sparked a war of words between BJP and Congress.Congress accused the governing BJP of ""hypocrisy, pretence and deceit"" as it recalled the relentless attack it has faced for allegedly signing an MoU with China's governing party. It demanded to know details of the meetings.BJP described the interaction as a ""formal meeting"" following ""improved"" relations between the two countries and hit back at Congress, saying it had nothing to hide as it was not entering into any secretive MoU with CPC. It also pointed to the meeting that leader of opposition - then Congress president - Rahul Gandhi had with the then Chinese ambassador during a tense standoff at Doklam in 2017.BJP sources said party's representatives - general secretary Arun Singh and foreign department head Vijay Chauthaiwale - brought up the border issues, export curbs like on tunnel boring machines as well as rare and critical minerals. These are not helpful for the professed desire to improve ties.CPC was keen on resumption of party-to-party ties with BJP, which had stalled since Singh led a party delegation to China in 2019, sources said, emphasising that the meetings, including with RSS on Tuesday, were requested by the visitors.On X, Chauthaiwale said they discussed at length ""the means to advance inter party communications"" between BJP and CPC. Chinese ambassador Xu Feihong also joined the delegation.RSS sources have said it was a courtesy meeting at the request of the visitors and was done with ministry of external affair's approval.Slamming BJP, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said people had a right to know what transpired in its closed-door meeting with the CPC delegation, alleging govt had pursued a policy of meek surrender in handling China.There was no problem in a political party engaging in dialogue with a party of another country, he said, accusing BJP of double standards. The CPC delegation also met Congress's foreign department head Salman Khurshid. Khera said govt had approved the meeting.BJP spokesperson Tuhin Sinha retorted that his party had nothing to hide. Congress was unable to explain its MoU so many years after it was signed, he said.The meeting, initiated at the request of CPC, has followed a thaw in the ties between two countries, with resumption of flights and ongoing efforts to boost trade, he noted.

Congress questions BJP’s China dealings

BJP hits back, cites ‘improved’ ties

TMC alleges ‘double standards’

NEW DELHI: A visit by a delegation of the Communist Party of China (CPC) to New Delhi has triggered a sharp political row with the Congress and the BJP trading accusations over transparency and India’s China policy.The row began after a CPC delegation led by its international department’s vice minister Sun Haiyan visited the BJP headquarters on Monday. Chinese Ambassador to India Xu Feihong was also part of the delegation.A BJP team headed by party general secretary Arun Singh discussed “the means to advance inter-party communications between the BJP and the Communist Party of China”, BJP's foreign affairs department in-charge Vijay Chauthaiwale wrote on X.The delegation also called on RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale on Tuesday in what PTI sources described as a courtesy visit requested by the Chinese side.The CPC delegation also met Congress leader and former external affairs minister Salman Khurshid. The Congress said the meeting took place at the delegation’s request and with the approval of the government of India.Latching on the visit, the Congress mounted an attack on the BJP accusing it of double standards and demanding full disclosure of its engagements with the CPC.He questioned whether the BJP or the RSS raised issues such as border transgressions, trade imbalance, rare earth supplies and Chinese support to Pakistan. “We have no problems that you meet… The issue is that do you raise critical questions when you meet behind closed doors?” Khera asked.""The BJP has taught even a chameleon how to change its colours. Those who were supposed to show 'red eyes' to China have instead rolled out a 'red carpet' for it. The BJP has held meetings with China's party, the CPC. Even when they were not in power, they used to visit China and hold meetings; RSS members even went there for training,"" he added.Demanding transparency, he said, “This must include public disclosure of the agenda, outcomes and minutes of all closed-door meetings held between representatives of the CPC and BJP/RSS functionaries.”The BJP rejected Congress’s allegations saying its meeting with the CPC was formal and open. BJP spokesperson Tuhin Sinha said, “It was a process of a formal meeting. A formal meeting takes place when a situation improves. We do it very openly.”“We do not secretly sign any such MoU which we can not explain for years,” he added.Sinha said the meeting took place because “things have improved”, pointing to the resumption of flights and ongoing trade talks. He also attacked Rahul Gandhi, saying he had lost the right to question the government’s foreign policy.BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said the Congress had “no locus” to raise border issues, claiming the roots of the China problem lay in the Nehru era. “Nevertheless, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government has been working to resolve it. And that effort is continuing unabated,” he said.The Trinamool Congress also criticised the BJP over the CPC visit. TMC Rajya Sabha deputy leader Sagarika Ghose accused the ruling party of hypocrisy, saying China had lent “open military support” to Pakistan during Operation Sindoor and had reiterated its claim over the Shaksgam Valley.“Just imagine if an opposition leader or party had done this.

JAMMU: Gunshots rang out in the air Tuesday after security forces launched a joint search operation in Najote, a remote village in J&K’s Kathua district, based on information about the presence of terrorists there. The area lies near Kamadh Nallah in Kahog forest belt, where an encounter had erupted on Jan 7. The same evening, officials said two “drone-like objects” were spotted hovering over a village in Rajouri district.“Intermittent firing was reported from Najote forest area in Billawar, about 10km from Kamadh Nallah,” an official said, adding that suspected terrorists fired a few rounds upon spotting the search party, attracting retaliatory fire. The cordon was subsequently fortified while troops continued hunting the ultras.“DIG (Jammu-Samba-Kathua Range) Shiv Kumar Sharma and Kathua SSP Mohita Sharma were present at the spot and monitored the ongoing operation till late Tuesday. However, no further contact was established,” an official said.Meanwhile, officials said at least two suspected drones were spotted near the LoC in Rajouri district in the evening.“Around 7.35pm, the objects were seen hovering over Dheri Dhara village under Manjakote PS in Rajouri district, before moving towards Kalali village,” said an official.In another such sighting, Army personnel manning Dungagala infiltration gap under Chingus police post in Rajouri spotted more drones — believed to be from Pakistan — around 7pm, and opened fire at the flying objects, following which they disappeared.","Security forces launched a joint search operation in Najote, a remote village in J&K’s Kathua district.

Hinduism vs Hindutva: TMC MP Mahua Moitra’s 'Love Jihad' Remark Ignites Fierce Political Debate

RAIPUR: The headmistress of a govt school in Chhattisgarh has been suspended while a contractual assistant teacher faces dismissal after a Class 4 English exam paper listed 'Ram' as a possible answer to a multiple-choice question about the name of a protagonist's dog, reports Partha Behera. The paper-setter said the error occurred as a result of inadvertently dropping the last letter of 'Ramu'.The school education department announced the decision on Saturday, four days after the question paper sparked protests across state by VHP, Bajrang Dal and other organisations. Shikha Soni, headmistress of a govt primary school in Nakti village of Tilda block, had set the paper for half-yearly examinations across govt schools in Raipur division. Namrata Verma, an assistant teacher on contract, moderated it.To the question 'What is the name of Mona's dog?', students had four options to choose from: 'Bala', 'Sheru', 'Ram' and 'No one'. Soni said the 'typo' went unnoticed while Verma said she failed to spot the incorrect option.Both maintained they had no intention of hurting religious sentiments or any community.","The headmistress of a govt school in Chhattisgarh has been suspended while a contractual assistant teacher faces dismissal.

It said that the provision contemplates ""maintenance of dependants"", including ""widowed daughter in-law"" from the estate of her father-in-law.""A son or the legal heirs are bound to maintain all the dependent persons out of estate inherited i.e. all persons whom the deceased was legally and morally bound to maintain. Therefore, on the death of son, it is the pious obligation of father-in-law to maintain widowed daughter-in-law, if she is unable to maintain herself either on her own or through the property left behind by the deceased son.

NEW DELHI: Another drones were sighted along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir , prompting the Indian Army to activate counter-Unmanned Aircraft System measures, ANI sources said on Tuesday.The drones were sighted second time in last 48 hours alonf the international border and LoC.The development comes amid a sharp warning from Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi to Pakistan over active terror camps across the border.ANI sources said the drones were detected in forward areas and were engaged using counter-UAS protocols to prevent any potential threat. Further details are awaited.The sightings come a day after security forces detected suspected Pakistan-origin drones along both the International Border and the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir’s Samba, Rajouri and Poonch districts. Officials said the flying objects were seen entering from the Pakistan side, hovering briefly over Indian territory and then returning.Following the sightings, ground search operations were launched across the affected areas. In the Nowshera sector of Rajouri district, Army troops opened fire with medium and light machine guns after observing drone movement over Gania-Kalsian village around 6.35 pm, officials said.Another drone was spotted over Khabbar village in the Teryath area of Rajouri district around the same time. In Samba district, a drone-like object with a blinking light was seen hovering for several minutes over Chak Babral village in the Ramgarh sector around 7.15 pm. A similar object was also noticed moving from the direction of Tain towards Topa in the Mankote sector along the LoC in Poonch district.The heightened alert along the border comes as Army chief General Dwivedi said that Operation Sindoor , launched in retaliation to the Pahalgam terror attack, remains ongoing and warned Islamabad against any future misadventure.“At least 6 terror camps still active across the LoC & 2 across the International Border after Operation Sindoor against Pakistan. Will act, if any (nefarious) attempts are carried out,” the Army chief said while addressing the annual Army Day press conference.Reflecting on the operation, he said, “Operation Sindoor was conceptualised and executed with precision. Through 22 minutes of initiation on 7th May and an orchestration that lasted 88 hours up to 10th May, the operation reset strategic assumptions by striking deep, dismantling terror infrastructure, and puncturing the longstanding nuclear rhetoric.”General Dwivedi said Indian forces destroyed seven of the nine identified targets and later played a key role in ensuring a calibrated response to Pakistani actions. He also said about 100 Pakistan Army personnel were killed in firing along the LoC and International Border during the period of heightened tensions.“The entire country stands with the Army,” he said, adding that any future response would be resolute and coordinated across services.Indian armed forces carried out precision strikes under Operation Sindoor on the intervening nights of May 6 and May 7, destroying terror hideouts in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and mainland Pakistan, including facilities linked to Jaish-e-Mohammad in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke. India has said the strikes were aimed solely at terror infrastructure, while subsequent Pakistani missile and drone attempts were intercepted by Indian air defence systems.","The drones were sighted second time in last 48 hours alonf the international border and LoC.

The case so far



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday continued hearing the case on stray dogs, warning that states will likely pay a compensation for 'not doing anything' for every bite that leads to death or injury to either children or the elderly.The apex court also asked for accountability from those claiming to be dog feeders, telling them to continue their activity from their house. The hearing took place in front of three-judge special bench comprising Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N.V. AnjariaJustice Nath said, ""For every dog bite, death or injury caused to children or elderly, we are likely going to fix heavy compensation by state, for not doing anything. Also, liability and accountability on those who are saying we are feedings dogs. Do it, take them to your house. Why should dogs be littering around, biting, scaring people?""Justice Mehta concurred with his views and said, “Who should be held accountable when dogs attack a 9-year-old? The organisation that is feeding them? You want us to shut our eyes to the problem.""The SC had refused to examine allegations of harassment of women dog feeders and caregivers, reiterating that such complaints fall under law and order issues and that affected individuals can lodge FIRs. Hearing arguments in the stray dogs case, the apex court also declined to consider claims that derogatory remarks were being made against women in the course of the debate.The three-judge special bench observed that some of the submissions made before it were 'far from reality' and pointed to several videos showing stray dogs attacking children and elderly persons.The court was hearing a batch of pleas, including those filed by dog lovers, seeking modification of its earlier orders as well as petitions demanding strict enforcement of existing directions.The bench clarified that it had never ordered the removal of all stray dogs from the streets and that its directions were limited to the treatment of stray canines in accordance with the Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules.It also flagged widespread non-compliance by civic bodies, noting that people were dying not only due to dog bites but also because of road accidents caused by stray animals.Citing an “alarming rise” in dog bite incidents in institutional areas such as schools, hospitals and railway stations, the Supreme Court on November 7 directed that stray dogs be relocated to designated shelters after due sterilisation and vaccination. It also ordered that dogs picked up should not be released back at the places from where they were removed.The court further directed authorities to ensure the removal of cattle and other stray animals from state highways, national highways and expressways.The Supreme Court is hearing the matter as a suo motu case initiated on July 28 last year following media reports on stray dog attacks leading to rabies, particularly among children, in the national capital.","The Supreme Court is hearing the matter as a suo motu case initiated on July 28 last year following media reports on stray dog attacks leading to rabies, particularly among children.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka's opposition BJP on Tuesday launched a sharp attack on the Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah and deputy CM DK Shivakumar for allegedly prioritising Rahul Gandhi over German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who landed in Bengaluru for his visit to India.The allegations follow the Congress leaders' presence in Mysuru to receive senior party leader Rahul Gandhi, who was transiting to neighbouring Tamil Nadu.In a post on X, LoP in the state assembly R Ashoka accused the Congress government of ""misplaced priorities and missed opportunities"". He said that welcoming the head of government from one of the world’s strongest economies had been relegated to the back seat, while ""political loyalty and high command pleasing"" were given precedence over Karnataka’s global standing.The LoP wrote, ""Whose interests come first, Karnataka's or the High Command's? Today, the Chancellor of Germany—one of the world's most powerful economic forces—arrived in our Karnataka. Any responsible Chief Minister would welcome such a global leader and leverage this meeting for the state's progress. They would view this encounter with a global leader as a golden opportunity to boost investment, job creation, and industrial development in our state.He further went on to lay charges on the leaders to betray Karnataka.

""But while the German chancellor landed in Bengaluru, Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar chose to be in Mysuru to receive Rahul Gandhi, who was merely transiting to Ooty (Gudalur in the Nilgiris district of Tamil Nadu).

Siddaramaiah, DK Shivakumar Project Unity After High-Stakes Karnataka Meet Amid Rumours Of Cong Rift

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi briefly met Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah and deputy CM DK Shivakumar at the Mysuru airport on Tuesday, fuelling speculation amid the ongoing power tussle between the two state Congress stalwarts.The interaction took place on the tarmac during Gandhi’s transit halt while returning to Delhi from Tamil Nadu. He spoke to both leaders, separately and together. Gandhi transited through Mysuru twice during the day—while travelling to Tamil Nadu and again on his return—with Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar present on both occasions.While the contents of the discussion are not known, party sources said it centred on the Congress’ “Save MGNREGA” campaign and the Karnataka government’s contribution to push for restoration of the 2006 legislation implemented by the erstwhile Congress-led Union government. The meeting came as both leaders were seeking an appointment with Gandhi.Siddaramaiah is reportedly pressing for a Cabinet reshuffle, while Shivakumar wants clarity on a leadership change. Party insiders believe approval for a reshuffle would indicate Siddaramaiah is set to complete his full term, weakening the prospects of Shivakumar, who also heads the party's state unit.Speculation over a potential leadership change has intensified since the Congress government crossed the halfway mark of its term in November last year, amid reports of an unconfirmed power-sharing arrangement at the time of government formation in May 2023.Siddaramaiah later told reporters there was “no confusion” within the party and said no political discussions took place during his meeting with Gandhi.","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi briefly met Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah and deputy CM DK Shivakumar at the Mysuru airport on Tuesday.

Harsh orders needed to curb corruption in judiciary: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/harsh-orders-needed-to-curb-corruption-in-judiciary-sc/articleshow/126515247.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: In a classic case of fence eating the grass, a UP trial court was cast in an adverse light when one of its court clerks, taking advantage of a man's drinking habit, made him sign a sale deed for a portion of his ancestral property and a civil judge gave orders to police to enforce the sale.Allahabad HC found that using the judicial process, the court clerk threw out a woman and her three children from the house using the sale deed signed by her husband in a drunken stupor. HC ordered the court clerk to restore the property to the woman within 48 hours and pay her Rs 1 lakh, and recommended disciplinary proceedings against the clerk and civil judge.Senior advocate H S Phoolka tried his best to project the clerk as an innocent victim of conspiracy before Supreme Court and said the HC had been unusually harsh. However, he failed to evoke sympathy from a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi.The CJI said such an act by a court clerk should have been adequate reason for the district judiciary to send him packing. ""Sometimes, we need to pass such harsh orders when it is found that a conspiracy is hatched within the four walls of the court, where people come for justice,"" the bench said.""We must send the right message. If we do not pass harsh orders in such incidents, it will be difficult for people to repose faith and trust in the judiciary. We see no ground to change a single word in the HC judgment. HC is absolutely right in passing the order,"" it added.Dismissing the court clerk's appeal, SC said, ""In the peculiar circumstances of the case, HC has issued these unusual directions to ensure public faith and trust in the judicial system is maintained. HC directions are befitting the facts of the case. None of the observations and consequential directions require our interference.""The court clerk, a peshkar in the court of the chief judicial magistrate, obtained a sale deed in his favour from the woman's husband dated Feb 14, 2024 for a portion of the undivided residential house, despite knowing full well that the property had not been divided between the brothers and co-sharers of the property. On Jan 13 last year, the woman resisted eviction action initiated through an interim order passed by the trial court. Following this, the court clerk obtained another decree and, with the help of police, evicted her.SC said it was unprecedented for a civil court to pass a decree on the day a suit was filed, and without issuing notice to co-sharers, who were not made parties to the suit.","Allahabad HC found that using the judicial process, the court clerk threw out a woman and her three children from the house using the sale deed signed by her husband in a drunken stupor.

Love, Anger, Fear, Sympathy: How Indians See Stray Dogs | I Witness

NEW DELHI: As dog lovers and feeders are pressing Supreme Court to roll back its order on making public institutions free of strays, the apex court on Tuesday asked them whether they can take responsibility in case of injury or death caused by stray dog bites and indicated that it will fix heavy compensation for victims.""For every dog bite, death or injury caused to children or elderly, we are going to fix heavy compensation for the victim to be paid by the state for not doing anything. Also, liability and accountability on those who are saying we are feeding dogs. Why should dogs be loitering around, biting, scaring people?...Who should be held accountable when dogs attack a nine-year-old? The organisation that is feeding them? You want us to shut our eyes to the problem?"" the court asked.Hearing the stray dogs issue for the fourth day, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria observed that people are very sympathetic towards stray dogs but not so towards homeless people and orphans as no one comes forward to take care of them. The hearing in the case has so far taken nine hours and still remains inconclusive. Around three dozen activists and lawyers have till now argued in the case.SC said those who are interested in feeding stray dogs should think of adopting them and keep them in their homes.The bench said arguments in court were going on and on, and observed that it has become a public platform for them - animal lovers - rather than for court proceedings. It said that the court wanted to take the Centre, states and municipal bodies to task for failure to implement the law to deal with the problem of strays, but it has not been able to do so because of large number of people turning up to argue the case which is repetitive in nature.""Our request to all the lawyers is to allow us to take to task the Union, state authorities and other bodies on steps taken by them. Allow us to pass an order. We need to spend half a day with the states and the Union. To see whether they have a plan of action or not. The problem has multiplied a thousand times. We just want implementation of statutory provision. Allow us to do that. Allow us to work. Allow us to proceed further. The same things are coming again and again. This has become a public platform rather than a court proceeding,"" the bench said.As some of the lawyers alleged that it would cost around Rs 26,000 crore to remove all strays from institutions and keep them in shelter homes, and urged the court that the amount could be better used for homeless people, SC said that why people, who are so sympathetic to animals, do not reach out to homeless people and support them.""A young counsel just showed us statistics of orphans on the streets. Perhaps some lawyers could argue for adoption of those children. Since 2011, since I was elevated to SC, these are the longest arguments I have heard. And, till now no one has argued so long for human beings,"" Justice Mehta observed.Senior advocate Arvind Datar, Vikas Singh, Pinky Anand, Menaka Guruswamy, Percival Billimoria along with others argued the case. The hearing will resume on Thursday.","Supreme Court says it will fix heavy compensation for victims of stray dog bites. Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria heard the case for the fourth day.

Pakistan sent Sindoor SOS after seeing Indian forces’ movement; 8 terror camps still active along Pakistan-side of border: Army chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-sent-sindoor-sos-after-seeing-indian-forces-movement-8-terror-camps-still-active-along-pakistan-side-of-border-army-chief/articleshow/126513131.cms,"Operation Sindoor Turning Points Revealed: Army Chief Tells What Forced Pakistan To Seek Ceasefire

NEW DELHI: Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Tuesday said the moves made by Army, Air Force and Navy on the morning of May 10 following the govt’s directive to prepare for a possible escalation of Operation Sindoor , acted as the decisive signal for Pakistan to seek suspension of the conflict. He also said that eight terrorist camps are currently active along the Pakistani side of the LoC and international border.The three-day conflict was triggered after India on May 7 last year targeted terror camps deep inside Pakistan and POK in retaliation against the jihadi terror attack at J&K’s Pahalgam in April. “The first (turning point) was the 22-minute strike on terrorist targets,” he said. The strike on terrorist targets “derailed the opposite side’s decision-making, and they took time to take that all in,” Gen Dwivedi said. “Due to this, there was confusion among them, and that led to mismanaged responses, which were met with our calibrated response,” he said.“The second turning point was that on the morning of May 10, the tri-forces of India were given certain directions about what to do if this war had escalated. They (Pakistan) had understood it, and hence, they called our DGMO,” General Dwivedi said in what marked the first formal confirmation of the govt’s decision to prepare for a full-scale conflict.“They (Pakistan) had complete information about which (Indian) ship, which strike or pivot, which core unit, or which aircraft was moving where, all from satellites. When they connected these dots, they said that the time has come to stop this war,” Dwivedi said. The General’s observations also marked yet another repudiation of US President Donald Trump’s incessant claims about having brokered the pause in the India-Pakistan conflict in May last year.He also spoke about the nuclear sabre-rattling by Pakistani politicians during the eventful four days (May 7-May 10). “As far as nuclear rhetoric is concerned, I would like to clarify that there was no discussion on the nuclear issue in the (India-Pakistan) DGMO talks. Whatever nuclear rhetoric was given by politicians or the public in Pakistan. I have no indication that anything of that sort came from the military,” he said.Emphasising that Operation Sindoor was “the best example of the tri-services’s synergy under clear-cut political directive and full freedom to act or respond”, Gen Dwivedi said, “The Army successfully destroyed seven out of the nine targets, and thereafter, played a pivotal role in ensuring a calibrated response to Pakistan’s actions.” He further said 100 “people associated with Pakistan” were killed in the firing along the Line of Control (LoC) or International Border (IB) during Operation Sindoor.On the current situation of terror hubs, the Army chief said, “There are six terror camps along the LoC and two along the IB. As per our knowledge, there is a presence of 100-150 terrorists there. If we spot any (mischievous) activities, we will definitely deal with it.”On sightings of multiple suspected Pakistani drones along the LoC and IB on Jan 10 and 11, the General said that India has conveyed a clear warning to Pakistan, saying New Delhi has told Islamabad that such activity is “not acceptable”.About violence in J&K, Dwivedi said 65% of the total terrorists eliminated in the UT last year were Pakistanis. He said 31 terrorists in total were eliminated by the armed forces in 2025 under Operation Mahadev, of whom three were the perpetrators of the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack . “Active local terrorists are now in single digits. Terrorist recruitment is almost non-existent, with only two in 2025,” he said. Mentioning “clear indicators of positive change in J&K”, the Army chief cited examples of robust development activity, the revival of tourism and the peaceful Amarnath Yatra, which saw over 4 lakh pilgrims, exceeding the five-year average.","Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Tuesday said the moves made by Army, Air Force and Navy on the morning of May 10 acted as the decisive signal for Pakistan to seek suspension of the conflict.

A crane collapse in Thailand on Wednesday led to a train derailment that killed at least 22 people and injured 30 others.The accident occurred Wednesday morning in Sikhio district, Nakhon Ratchasima province, about 230 km (143 miles) northeast of Bangkok, on a passenger train travelling from Bangkok to Ubon Ratchathani province.Live footage broadcast by local media showed rescue workers at the site, with a brightly coloured train lying on its side and smoke rising from the wreckage.Police said the fire has been extinguished and rescue operations are under way.“Twenty-two people were killed and more than 30 injured,” Thatchapon Chinnawong, a local police chief in Nakhon Ratchasima province, told news agency AFP.Meanwhile, the province’s public relations department said on Facebook that four bodies have been recovered so far.Transport minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn said 195 passengers were on board, and authorities are working to identify the deceased.The crane was part of a $5.4-billion high-speed rail project in Thailand, supported by China.

CHANDIGARH: Haryanvi singer Masoom Sharma has defended the region’s music industry following state government’s move to remove songs promoting gun culture and violence from YouTube.Reacting to the decision, Sharma said:, “The real solution is that if something is problematic, there should be proper laws made and implemented across the country. I would even welcome laws against obscenity. Similarly, apps that mislead and corrupt youth, like gambling apps that are rampant these days, should also be banned. There are many issues that need attention, and targeting individual artists alone does not solve the problem. ..”He added, ""the day the film industry here develops and reaches a good standard, from that day onwards, the music industry and cinema of Haryana will have a dominant presence everywhere, just like Bollywood.”In a major crackdown, the special task force (STF) and cyber unit of Haryana Police acted against 67 songs that they said glorified gangsterism, weapons, and violence.These tracks had been uploaded on YouTube, Spotify, and other music platforms, according to a police official on Tuesday.Investigators found that such songs influenced youth, glorified gangsters, and portrayed an unrealistic image of luxury associated with criminal life, pushing young people towards crime. Most of the content was either removed or blocked. Haryana Police said this action marked the beginning of stricter oversight.Haryana DGP Ajay Singhal described the move as “a crucial step taken in the interest of society and the younger generation.” He said the aim was “not merely to stop crime, but to save young people from stepping into the world of crime.”“The truth is that the lives of such criminals are filled with hardships, dangers, and, ultimately, legal consequences. Often, their families also suffer because of their criminal activities,” the DGP added, emphasising that no platform would be allowed to host content that promoted crime culture.","Haryanvi singer Masoom Sharma has defended the region’s music industry.

Iran on Wednesday to execute a 26-year-old man who was detained only last week amid mass protests and a sweeping crackdown by the Khamenei-led regime.Erfan Soltani, a resident of Fardis, west of Tehran, was arrested in connection with protests in the nearby city of Karaj. His case has intensified concerns over the rising death toll linked to the ongoing unrest.A relative told BBC Persian that “in an extremely rapid process, within just two days, the court issued a death sentence, and the family was told that he is due to be executed [this] Wednesday”.According to sources close to the family, Soltani was arrested on January 8 and sentenced to death without a trial. The family was informed on Monday that the sentence is scheduled to be carried out on Wednesday. The exact charges against him remain unclear.Soltani’s case is drawing attention as a possible first execution linked to the latest wave of protests against the Islamic Republic under Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump issued a sharp warning to Tehran, saying Washington would respond strongly if executions proceed as part of the crackdown.“We will take very strong actions if they do such thing,” Trump told CBS News, when asked about reports that hangings could begin as early as Wednesday.He also reiterated a message he had earlier posted on social media, saying that “help is on its way” for Iranian protesters. Referring to casualties, Trump said, “I hear numbers -- look, one death is too much -- but I hear much lower numbers, and then I hear much higher numbers.”Iran is witnessing one of the most serious waves of unrest in decades, with large numbers of protesters taking to the streets across the country. The government has responded by shutting down internet and communication services, leaving many Iranians cut off from the outside world.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), which has tracked previous rounds of unrest in Iran, reports that at least 2,571 people have been killed as of early Wednesday.","Erfan Soltani, a 26-year-old man, was arrested just last week amid widespread protests.

Candace Owens draws fierce reaction after naming Israel in controversial safety claim





A viral clip has pushed Candace Owens back into the center of America’s loudest political arguments. Shared widely across social platforms, the video shows Owens delivering a sharp warning about personal safety, power, and accountability. Her comments connect her own public profile with that of Tucker Carlson, and they land at a moment when political speech feels more combustible than ever.The reaction was immediate. Supporters praised Owens for saying what they believe others avoid. Critics accused her of crossing a dangerous line. What drives the clip’s momentum is not just its message, but its emotional force. Owens speaks with visible frustration, blending fear, anger, and distrust toward institutions she believes have failed ordinary Americans. That mix has helped the clip travel fast and far.Owens did not hedge or soften her words. In the clip, she said: “What happened to Tucker Carlson or me? You obviously know that Israel was involved, obviously. That is unbelievably apparent in their rhetoric, their name-checking us, they're calling us on stage, they're sending their goons out to harass us because we believe in America first and that we should stop getting involved in their interests.”She added, “And that it is unacceptable, frankly, that our government gives more flack to Tucker Carlson, our government representatives give more flack to Tucker Carlson. We don't even have a government in my view. We can't even protect the nation's most innocent. How do we even have a government? I guess that's a larger philosophical question.”The Epstein reference shifted the tone instantly. What began as a warning about speech and safety turned into a broader indictment of moral priorities in Washington. That pivot is why the clip resonates. It taps into long standing anger about power protecting itself while demanding restraint from critics.Whether viewed as reckless or revealing, the moment captures something real about today’s political climate. Trust is thin. Language is sharper. And viral clips now shape national debate faster than policy ever could.Also Read: “I don't have much time”: Candace Owens says Charlie Kirk appeared in her dreams with a disturbing warning about who betrayed him","Candace Owens sparked controversy after a viral clip in which she said Israel should be blamed if anything happens to her or Tucker Carlson.

Trump Pulls U.S. Out of 66 Global Bodies, Slams UN Groups As ‘Woke’ & Anti-American





Israel is set to immediately sever all contact with several United Nations agencies and international bodies following a review conducted after the United States’ withdrawal from dozens of international organisations.The move, Jerusalem said, was prompted by what it described as persistent bias, politicisation, and actions hostile to Israel by the affected bodies.Last week, US president Donald Trump withdrew the United States from 66 international organizations and treaties, around half of them linked to the United Nations, accusing the bodies of acting “contrary to the interests of the United States.”""After an examination and discussion conducted following the US withdrawal from dozens of international organizations, Israel's minister of foreign affairs @gidonsaar has decided that Israel will immediately sever all contact with the following UN agencies and international organizations. In addition, foreign minister Sa'ar has instructed his Ministry to immediately examine, in consultation with relevant government ministries, when necessary, the continued cooperation between Israel and other organizations. Further decisions will be made following thorough examination and an additional discussion,” Israel’s foreign ministry said through a post on X.The decision, effective immediately, applies to the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict; the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women); the UN Conference on Trade and Development; the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia; the UN Alliance of Civilizations; UN Energy; and the Global Forum on Migration and Development.The Foreign Ministry said it was ending cooperation with the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict after the agency included the Israel Defense Forces in its annual “blacklist” on children in armed conflict, alongside Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.“Israel is the only democratic country to be listed, alongside ISIS and Boko Haram ,” the ministry noted, adding that Israel had already cut ties with the office in June 2024.The ministry said Sa’ar withdrew Israel from UN Women after it “deliberately ignored all cases of sexual violence committed against Israeli women on October 7, 2023.”It said Israel also exited the UN Agency for Trade and Development and the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia over what it described as “virulent anti-Israel reports,” while accusing the Alliance of Civilizations of being “used as a platform for attacks against Israel.”Finally, the ministry accused UN Energy of being a “wasteful organization,” saying it exemplified the “excessive and inefficient bureaucracy of the UN,” and said the Global Forum on Migration and Development “erodes the ability of sovereign nations to enforce their own immigration laws.”Israel has long accused the United Nations of systemic bias, noting that more resolutions are passed against it each year than against all other countries combined.It has been especially critical of UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, accusing it, well before Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack in southern Israel, of colluding with Hamas and promoting anti-Israel incitement, allegations the agency denies.Citing what it describes as entrenched links to terror groups, Israel has banned UNRWA from operating within its territory and has restricted its activities in Gaza and the West Bank.","Israel is set to immediately sever all contact with several United Nations agencies and international bodies.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned that the United States would respond forcefully if Iranian authorities begin carrying out hangings as part of their crackdown on a widespread uprising against the government.“We will take very strong action if they do such a thing,” Trump told CBS News in an interview, when asked about the possibility of hangings starting as early as Wednesday.“When they start killing thousands of people — and now you're telling me about hanging. We'll see how that's going to work out for them,” he said in a video clip from the interview released online.The interview was conducted while Trump was in the northern US state of Michigan, where he visited a manufacturing plant and delivered a speech focused on the economy.During that speech, Trump reiterated a message he had earlier posted on social media, saying that “help is on its way” for Iranian protesters. He also said the true scale of the death toll in Iran remained unclear. “I hear numbers — look, one death is too much — but I hear much lower numbers, and then I hear much higher numbers,” he said.Later, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his return to Washington, Trump said he was due to receive a briefing on the situation in Iran.“The killing looks like it's significant, but we don't know yet for certain. I'll know within 20 minutes — and we'll act accordingly,” he said.Trump has previously said the United States would step in if protesters were killed, a threshold that rights groups say has already been crossed.At least 734 people have been confirmed killed, although the actual toll is likely far higher, according to Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights (IHR), as reported by AP.Concerns have intensified that the Islamic republic could turn to executions to suppress the protests after Tehran prosecutors said capital charges of “moharebeh,” or “waging war against God,” would be sought against some detainees arrested during recent demonstrations.“Concerns are mounting that authorities will once again resort to swift trials and arbitrary executions to crush and deter dissent,” Amnesty International said.IHR highlighted the case of 26-year-old Erfan Soltani, who was arrested last week in Karaj, a satellite city of Tehran. According to a family source cited by the group, Soltani has already been sentenced to death and could be executed as early as Wednesday.","US President Donald Trump says the United States will respond forcefully if Iranian authorities begin carrying out hangings.

President Donald Trump appeared to lash out at a worker who shouted pedophile protector during his visit to Ford Motor Company’s River Rouge complex in Dearborn, Michigan, on Tuesday, with video showing him seemingly responding with an expletive and the middle finger.Footage obtained by TMZ captured the moment as Trump toured the plant, pointing towards the person off camera before walking away and raising his middle finger.The visit took place hours before the president was due to speak at the Detroit Economic Club as part of his Michigan trip.While the man who shouted at Trump is not seen in the video, the insult is audible, though it is difficult to make out what else was said due to unclear audio.The outburst comes as Trump continues to face scrutiny over the handling of files linked to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who died in jail in 2019.Trump was criticised last year after pushing back for months against releasing the Epstein files, despite earlier suggesting during the campaign that they would be made public if he returned to office.A bipartisan group of lawmakers pushed legislation to compel the Justice Department to release its Epstein-related files, and the bill ultimately passed with overwhelming support, prompting Trump to reverse course and back the effort.Despite that shift, the Justice Department has missed multiple deadlines, including a requirement to release the files with limited redactions by mid-December and provide further details to Congress about the redaction process.Trump’s relationship with Epstein has remained part of the public debate, after he was photographed with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell multiple times in the 1990s and early 2000s.Trump has denied wrongdoing and has not been accused by any Epstein survivors.","Donald Trump appeared to lash out at a worker who shouted pedophile protector during his visit to Ford Motor Company’s River Rouge complex in Dearborn, Michigan.

November 2026 is an important month for Donald Trump . The US President will be facing midterm elections during this time and the results could not only determine the control of the House and Senate but also decide if the President will be impeached, for the third time.The 79-year-old has been worried about his fate since the beginning of 2026. At a recent House GOP retreat at the Kennedy Center in Washington, he asked his fellow Republicans to "" win the midterms because, if we don’t win the midterms, it’s just going to be — I mean, they’ll find a reason to impeach me.”From speeches to fundraising attempts, the President has been doing it all to ensure the continuation of his reign and one of his most recent fundraising emails was exposed on social media by left-wing Democrat influencer Harry Sisson.Sisson, 24, took to X and Instagram to reveal Trump's recent fundraising email that was allegedly sent to his supporters and allies. Titled 'I'm alone and in the dark.' the mail warned how American lives would change if Trump were impeached and asked for a donation.""Trump sent this creepy email to his supporters last night saying he’s “alone and in the dark” and he’s writing the message from a “dying laptop.” The only way to help him is to donate your money to him.Disgusting grift. Very weird!"" wrote Sisson in the caption of the post, attaching screenshots of the mail.Beginning with a photo of a serious-looking Trump, the mail reads: ""I'm sitting here. Alone. In the war room. Fighting for you. The rest of the staff went home hours ago. It's just me, one dying laptop, and the 72-hour countdown clock to my first mid-month deadline of the year just RANG.""He went on to warn that if he didn't ""crush"" his first mid-month deadline of the year, then the ""radical Left"" will ""open borders forever"", ""confiscate guns"" and ""brainwash kids.""""And worst of all, your favourite President (ME!) might just go through another FAKE impeachment!,"" he added.He went on to ask '$47' from every 'red-blooded American who wants to save the country.'In a related video he posted on Instagram, Sisson acknowledged that political fundraising emails from the left and right can get ""pretty weird"" sometimes, but the one sent by Trump recently, was ""insane and crazy.""""I wonder how people who fall for that, people who happily donate money to that clown, I wonder how those people would treat a desperate homeless beggar in the streets,"" commented a person under Sisson's X post.""Imagine stealing millions and still ask for donations"" added another.""He doesn’t want to use any of his own stolen billions?

When New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani said he was 'briefed' about US military's capture of Nicolas Maduro from Venezuela, critics laughed off and advised Mamdani to get down from the 'high horse' as he is just the NYC mayor. But as it turns out, Mamdani and President Donald Trump have been texting each other back and forth recently, Axios reported, citing two sources.The texting started soon after Trump and Mamdani exchanged numbers during their November meeting. It was the same meeting where Trump told Mamdani he was even better looking in person and the same meeting where Trump shielded Mamdani from an uncomfortable question. Mamdani was asked after his cordial meeting whether he would still call Trump a fascist. Trump saved him and said, “That’s OK. You can just say it. That’s easier. It’s easier than explaining it. I don’t mind.”Analysts said Mamdani charmed Trump or vice versa.While it's not known what they have spoken about in their text messages, Mamdani told the press that he had called Trump to express his displeasure with the US strikes on Venezuela. He was asked about Trump's response to it. Mamdani said he left it at registering his stance.Trump later told the New York Times that he was ""surprised"" by Mamdani's comment and ""thought it was awfully quick for him to be criticizing."" Using the past tense, Trump said that ""I did"" have a good relationship with Mamdani, but ""he hit me sooner than I thought.""One top administration official was surprised Mamdani made the call and thought he was out of line in doing so, Axios said, adding that Mamdani maintained that he is honest and direct with President Trump about places of disagreement.Insiders claimed that the recent text messages are friendly, as it's not practical for them to scream at each other and at the same time they can't appear too cozy.","New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani and President Donald Trump have been texting each other back and forth recently, Axios reported.

Do you not know what the word benevolent means bro?”Shirley became popular when uploaded a viral video alleging that 10 Somali-run daycare centers had misappropriated over $100 million in taxpayer funds in Minnesota.Following Shirley's video, the Department of Homeland Security launched a deportation effort in the twin cities aimed at deporting illegal Somali migrants. A DHS spokesperson also added in a statement that the Trump administration is 'all hands on deck to root out criminals in Minnesota who are defrauding the American people.'Moreover, FBI director Kash Patel in December also addressed Shirley's video by writing on X that the bureau had 'surged personnel and investigative resources' to Minnesota for the purpose of dismantling 'large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs.'Currently, no arrests have been made by the administration over alleged fraud uncovered in Shirley's video.","Nick Shirley, 23, became an online sensation and hero after he uncovered the Minnesota daycare fraud.

Trump Warns Khamenei Is 'Crossing Red Line' As Death Toll Spikes To 544

What is the Muslim Brotherhood?

Why it matters





President Donald Trump’s administration on Tuesday designated three Middle Eastern branches of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist organisations, imposing sanctions on the groups and their members in a move that could have implications for US ties with allies such as Qatar and Turkiye.The Treasury and State departments announced the actions against the Lebanese, Jordanian and Egyptian chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood, saying the groups pose a risk to the United States and American interests.The State Department designated the Lebanese branch as a foreign terrorist organisation, the most severe classification, making it a criminal offence to provide material support to the group. The Jordanian and Egyptian branches were listed by the Treasury Department as specially designated global terrorists for providing support to Hamas.“These designations reflect the opening actions of an ongoing, sustained effort to thwart Muslim Brotherhood chapters' violence and destabilisation wherever it occurs,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.“The United States will use all available tools to deprive these Muslim Brotherhood chapters of the resources to engage in or support terrorism.”Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent were directed last year under an executive order signed by Trump to determine the most appropriate way to impose sanctions on the groups, which US officials say engage in or support violence and destabilisation campaigns that harm the United States and other regions.Muslim Brotherhood leaders have said they renounce violence.Trump’s executive order singled out the chapters in Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt, citing US assessments that a wing of the Lebanese branch launched rockets on Israel after Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war in Gaza. The order also said leaders of the group in Jordan had provided support to Hamas.Founded in Egypt in 1928, the Muslim Brotherhood was banned in Egypt in 2013. Jordan announced a sweeping ban on the group in April.Founded in Egypt in 1928, the Muslim Brotherhood is an Islamist movement that began as a religious and social organisation before evolving into a major political force across parts of the Middle East. It advocates governance based on Islamic principles and has operated through a mix of political participation, social outreach and activism in different countries.The group functions through country-specific branches that operate independently while sharing a common ideological foundation. While the Muslim Brotherhood says it has renounced violence, several governments, including Egypt, have accused it of supporting or engaging in militant activity.Following the military overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi, a Brotherhood leader, Egypt banned the organisation in 2013. Since then, the group has faced varying degrees of restriction or prohibition across the region.Analysts say the US designation could reshape regional diplomatic equations and complicate Washington’s relations with countries where the Muslim Brotherhood remains politically active or tolerated.Nathan Brown, a professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, said some US allies, including the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, would likely welcome the move.“For other governments where the brotherhood is tolerated, it would be a thorn in bilateral relations,” including in Qatar and Turkiye, he said.Brown also warned that the designation could have wider legal and humanitarian consequences beyond foreign policy.“I think this would give immigration officials a stronger basis for suspicion, and it might make courts less likely to question any kind of official action against Brotherhood members who are seeking to stay in this country, seeking political asylum,” he said.The move also revives a debate Trump had opened during his first term. The Republican president had weighed designating the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organisation in 2019, and some of his supporters have since pushed for tougher action.At the domestic level, the shift aligns with actions taken by Republican-led state governments. Florida and Texas designated the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organisation earlier this year, signalling growing political momentum in the US against the group.","The Treasury and State departments announced the actions against the Lebanese, Jordanian and Egyptian chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood.

The bigger picture: The internet has become a protest battleground





When mass protests erupt in Iran, one of the first responses from authorities is often the same: shut down the internet.The tactic has been used repeatedly during major unrest, limiting communication between protest organisers, slowing the spread of footage, and cutting off access to independent news. In Iran’s latest blackout, internet availability has reportedly collapsed to a fraction of normal levels.Yet even when the lights go out online, some Iranians have found a way to stay connected. Increasingly, that backdoor has a name: Starlink.Starlink is SpaceX ’s satellite internet service, designed to deliver broadband from space rather than relying on fibre lines and mobile networks. That technical detail is what makes it useful during shutdowns.Unlike traditional internet infrastructure, satellite connectivity is harder for a government to switch off nationwide, because it does not depend on local towers and state-controlled telecom networks. Even during severe blackouts, some users have reported access through Starlink, although service can be unstable.For protest movements, that access can be critical. It helps people:Starlink is not authorised in Iran. Tehran has repeatedly declared the service illegal and treated it as a national security issue.Despite that, terminals have entered the country through informal channels. Over time, an underground ecosystem has grown around satellite connectivity, with Starlink devices becoming one of the most valuable tools for staying online during internet shutdowns. Estimates suggest that tens of thousands of terminals may now be inside Iran, sometimes serving multiple users through shared access.Iran’s crackdown has gone beyond cutting mobile data. Authorities have also focused on disrupting Starlink directly.Reports suggest Iran has attempted to jam Starlink signals, weakening reliability and making it difficult to upload videos and images. That matters because uploads are often the main way protest footage reaches the outside world.Iranian authorities have also taken steps to locate terminals, particularly in high-risk areas, where satellite dishes and equipment may draw attention.One reason Starlink remains relevant is that disruption does not always stay permanent.Starlink has tried to counter jamming through technical adjustments, including software updates designed to reduce interference. The result is an ongoing “cat and mouse” dynamic. Conditions can improve, then worsen again, depending on how aggressively interference is deployed and how quickly workarounds are introduced.For many users on the ground, it becomes a question of whether the connection works long enough to send out key information.For users, the danger is not only technical.Iran has moved toward harsher legal penalties connected to Starlink access, including proposals and laws framing possession as a serious offence tied to national security. Reports have said penalties could reach as high as 10 years in prison, adding another layer of risk for anyone using or transporting terminals.For years, one obstacle to satellite-based access in Iran was not only Tehran’s laws, but also sanctions compliance.In 2022, the US expanded authorisation for certain communication services, software and hardware intended to support internet freedom for Iranians. The shift helped reduce restrictions on tools designed to keep people connected during crackdowns and shutdowns.Iran has also tried to push back through international channels.Tehran has raised the issue within the UN’s telecommunications system, arguing that Starlink is operating without permission inside Iranian territory. The dispute highlights a key challenge for regulators: portable terminals and satellite coverage make enforcement difficult, even when governments object.Starlink’s role in Iran’s protests has also expanded into political headlines.Recent reporting has said President Donald Trump discussed Iran’s blackout and spoke with Elon Musk about restoring or strengthening Starlink connectivity. Musk has signalled that engineers were working on ways to counter interference and keep access available.Iran’s internet shutdown strategy is not only about censorship. It is about control.When access collapses, protests become harder to coordinate and harder to document. When Starlink works, even partially, it helps protesters bypass restrictions and keep information flowing.That is why Starlink has become more than a service during Iran’s unrest. It is a contested lifeline, shaped by jamming, underground networks, international disputes, and the growing reality that modern protest movements depend as much on connectivity as they do on crowds in the street.","Starlink is SpaceX’s satellite internet service, designed to deliver broadband from space rather than relying on fibre lines and mobile networks.

"Trump urges Iranians to revolt, pledging help",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-urges-iranians-to-revolt-pledging-help/articleshow/126509621.cms,"US President Donald Trump (AP)

TOI correspondent from Washington:





US President Donald Trump has certifiably changed his mind on regime change. On Tuesday, the MAGA supremo directly encouraged a public uprising in Iran after imposing a blanket 25 per cent tariff on any country that continues to do business with the Islamic Republic in an effort to topple the ruling Islamic government in Teheran.""Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING - TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!! Save the names of the killers and abusers. They will pay a big price….HELP IS ON ITS WAY. MIGA!!!” Trump posted on social media amid reports of a bloodbath in Iran following a crackdown on protests, unapologetically wading into Iran's internal affairs.Trump’s open backing for the revolt came hours after he said Iranian leadership had reached out to him for talks and the U.S was weighing a choice between military action and negotiations, with some senior aides, including vice-president J.D.Vance, reportedly in favor of the latter course. “There seems to be some people killed who weren’t supposed to be killed. We’re looking at it very seriously; the military’s looking at it. And there’s a couple options,” Trump said on Monday as reports of a bloody crackdown flowed out of Iran.By Tuesday morning, the U.S President appeared to have set his mind on effecting a regime change in yet another country (after similar approach in Venezuela and Cuba), announcing he has “cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS,” and pledging “HELP IS ON ITS WAY.”While Trump campaigned in the past against regime-change wars, his administration is now openly exploring tools to bring about leadership change in Iran and Cuba, after effecting one in Venezuela. He has reportedly been briefed on options ranging from long-range missile strikes to cyber operations and psychological campaigns in Iran, and even though White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said “diplomacy is always the first option for the president,” the temptation to pull off a coup in Iran on the back of widespread protests appears irresistible for now for Washington hawks like Senator Lindsay Graham.Analysts point to several reasons behind Trump’s evolution from opposing regime change to actively pursuing it in countries such as Iran, Venezuela, and Cuba. The administration views these governments as economically weak and politically brittle, believes coercive leverage can work without large-scale U.S. troop deployments, and increasingly frames them as part of a broader anti-American axis aligned with China and Russia. A more conspiratorial explanation by critics, who have dubbed Trump the ""Walt Disney of chaos"" is such frenetic activity is designed to distract voters from everyday issues at home.Many MAGA principals remain skeptical of Washington getting into another fracas in the middle-east. Former Trump aide Steve Bannon among others are berating Fox News and Graham for encouraging the latest caper, reminding them of the quagmire the U.S got into in Iraq. While most Democrats have uniformly opposed U.S interference in Iran, even some Republican lawmakers, the ""non-interventionist"" wing of the party have cautioned about getting into another fracas.""The Constitution does not permit the executive branch to unilaterally commit an act of war against a sovereign nation that hasn't attacked the United States,"" Thomas Massie, an anti-Trump Kentucky Republican said while introducing a bipartisan War Powers Resolution to block unauthorized hostilities against Iran.","US President Donald Trump has changed his mind on regime change.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions, with nine more Baloch citizens allegedly taken away by Pakistsecurity agencies in recent weeks.Human rights defenders stated that these incidents follow a familiar pattern: individuals are arrested without warrants, held in secret locations, and never brought before a court, as reported by The Balochistan Post.According to The Balochistan Post, sources in Mand, Kech district, stated that Abdullah, son of Iqbal, was whisked away and shifted to an unknown facility. In Karachi, 24-year-old student Hamdan, son of Muhammad Ali, was detained by CTD officials in the Golimar area, with no subsequent legal proceedings or public acknowledgement of his custody.On November 2, 2025, three youths, Dawood Baloch, Usman Baloch, and Hakeem Majeed Baloch, were picked up during early-morning raids in Bhatta Colony by teams from Military Intelligence and the CTD. Their whereabouts remain undisclosed.Additional cases include the late-night detention of religious instructor Zubair from Quetta's Lak Pass area on November 20; the abduction of labourer Muhammad Iqbal Marri from outside the Rakhni Sessions Court in Barkhan on December 26; and the raid in Mastung on 11 December in which Frontier Corps and CTD personnel allegedly took 21-year-old herder Saeed Ahmed.Families say none of these detainees have resurfaced. According to another report, 17-year-old student Jamal Murad was apprehended in Gwadar on 2 January by CTD and Military Intelligence operatives, after which he disappeared.The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) continued its protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club, marking its 6,052nd day. Families, including the relatives of Nasreena Baloch, reportedly detained during a raid in Hub Chowki, joined the demonstration.Her family stated that local police refused to register an FIR, while the Hub Press Club was locked to stop their press briefing, as highlighted by The Balochistan Post.VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch accused state institutions of weaponising national security to intensify enforced disappearances, even targeting Baloch women. He said detainees are denied legal rights, courts are bypassed, and new laws merely protect extrajudicial actions.He called on national and international bodies to take meaningful steps to end the crisis and secure the release of all missing persons, as reported by The Balochistan Post.","A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality





Pakistan on Saturday claimed that Iraq has expressed “keen interest” in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft, following talks between the air chiefs of the two countries.According to a statement issued by the Pakistan Army, air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, chief of air staff of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), met lieutenant general staff pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi, commander of the Iraqi Air Force, during an official visit to Iraq.The discussions focused on enhancing bilateral military cooperation, including joint training, capacity building and operational coordination.“The Iraqi air chief praised PAF’s professionalism and technological advancement, expressed interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak trainer aircraft,” the statement said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Both sides also agreed to pursue joint exercises and training initiatives to strengthen interoperability between the two air forces.The JF-17 Thunder is a single-engine, lightweight combat aircraft jointly developed by China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation and the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex.Pakistan has claimed that the aircraft proved its capabilities during last year’s conflict with India, although its effectiveness remains disputed.Pakistan had also deployed Chinese-origin J-10 fighter jets during the May 7–10 hostilities with India.The development comes days after Pakistan and Bangladesh air chiefs held talks on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 jets by Dhaka. However, Bangladesh has not officially confirmed any such plan.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif recently claimed that the country has seen increased interest in its fighter aircraft following the May 2025 standoff with India. Reports have also suggested that Pakistan is exploring similar defence deals with other countries, including Saudi Arabia, amid ongoing financial pressures.Notably, Pakistan has repeatedly relied on International Monetary Fund support in recent years, with the IMF approving a $7 billion bailout in September 2024 and an additional $1.4 billion loan in May 2025.",Iraq has expressed “keen interest’ in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft.
