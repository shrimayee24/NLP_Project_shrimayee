Congress also targeted PM Narendra Modi and BJP-RSS, alleging them of fomenting hatred and religious division and attacking the Constitution, and termed the law as part of the communal strategy of the governing party.Rahul also warned of an ""economic devastation"" in the wake of tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump .

Kharge said, ""Modi will sell the country"".Interestingly, Rahul said only Congress has the ideology to fight and stop BJP and RSS, which other parties cannot, and argued that parties that don't have clarity or ideology cannot stand up to RSS-BJP - in what was an echo of his speech at the Udaipur 'chintan shivir' which riled allies.","Congress leadership led by Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday termed it as an attack on the freedom of religion and the Constitution.

"As Tahawwur Rana lands in India, multi-agency team to interrogate 26/ 1 1 conspirator",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/as-tahawwur-rana-lands-in-india-multi-agency-team-to-interrogate-26/11-conspirator/articleshow/120140699.cms,"NEW DELHI: A multi-agency team comprising investigators from two intelligence agencies, besides the National Investigation Agency and a team of psychologists specialising in criminology, will begin the interrogation of Tahawwur Rana , one of the masterminds of the 2008 Mumbai attack, after he lands in Delhi on Thursday.Home minister Amit Shah, national security adviser Ajit Doval and foreign minister S Jaishankar held a meeting on Wednesday evening to review the security arrangements and course of action ahead of Rana's arrival.TOI was the first to report on Rana's dispatch. His custody was handed over to Indian sleuths in Los Angeles on Tuesday evening.The website of the US Federal Bureau of Prisons has updated the status against Rana's name saying he wasn't in their custody as of Tuesday. Rana's register number (22829-424) read: ""Not in BOP custody as of 04/08/2025.""A team of officials drawn from Indian agencies in the US was tasked with facilitating his return. Sources said the chief investigating officer, DIG (NIA) Jaya Roy , signed off on the 'surrender warrant' Tuesday, following which swift arrangements were made to fly him to Delhi. The team left Wednesday around 6.30am, aiming to complete the journey with a brief pit stop. Incidentally, NIA is headed by Sadanand Date , a Maharashtra cadre IPS officer who, along with other colleagues, had rushed to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus area on the fateful evening of Nov 26, 2008 after the terrorists struck at targets selected by, among others, Rana's partner in the massacre David Coleman Headley .Rana's interrogators, a source said, will aim to get him to divulge details about Pakistani state actors involved in the 26/11 plot, details of ISI network, as well as LeT's local collaborators and sources of funding. There also seems to be recognition that breaking down a hardened terrorist, especially one motivated by jihad, may not be easy. ""He has already been probed extensively, and cracking him will not be an easy task. He would know where to mislead us and create smokescreens. This will be time-consuming,"" said a source in the know.Rana (64) is learned to have already got his contacts to engage his defence counsel. Due to security reasons, Rana may not be taken to court and his remand proceedings may be held in camera, sources said.","Tahawwur Rana, one of the masterminds of the 2008 Mumbai attack, lands in Delhi on Thursday.

"Naveen Patnaik backs VK Pandian amid Waqf Bill row, warns BJD leaders against 'large' internal meetings",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/naveen-patnaik-backs-vk-pandian-amid-waqf-bill-row-warns-bjd-leaders-against-large-internal-meetings/articleshow/120132153.cms,"Naveen Patnaik came out in strong defence of his close aide VK Pandian

NEW DELHI: BJD president and former Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Wednesday came out in strong defence of his close aide VK Pandian, calling for unity within the party after signs of internal rift emerged over the controversial Waqf (Amendment) Bill , 2025.The bill, now a law following Presidential assent, saw the BJD divided in the Rajya Sabha with MPs casting split votes, an unusual move for a party known for its discipline. While MP Sasmit Patra supported the bill, another MP, Muzibulla Khan , opposed it. One member, Debashish Samantaray, remained absent. The confusion has prompted criticism from the BJP and concerns within the BJD ranks.Naveen Patnaik also came down heavily on his party colleagues for holding large meetings in hotels amid growing internal rift following party members' split voting on the Bill in Rajya Sabha five days ago. While he didn’t name anyone directly, the remarks were widely seen as a response to speculation around growing discontent in the party, particularly over Pandian’s influence.Rejecting all such talk, senior BJD leader Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak told ANI, “There is no infighting at all. All MPs, MLAs and workers are united under the leadership of Naveen Patnaik. We are and will always remain a secular party.”Backing him, BJD veteran Bhupinder Singh warned against any attempt to undermine the party's unity. “There is no groupism... An outsider cannot lead the party. Naveen Patnaik is the only leader,” Singh said, in an indirect reference to Pandian’s critics within the organisation.BJD’s Shashi Bhushan Behera echoed the sentiment, saying the meeting in Bhubaneswar was a routine affair. “The public stands with Naveen Patnaik. He is aware of everything. All leaders are with him.”But outside the party, the BJP remained unconvinced. Rajya Sabha MP Sujeet Kumar questioned the BJD’s flip-flop on the bill. “They are totally confused. One MP supported, another opposed, and one didn’t even show up. It’s a drama. Let them explain this to the public,” he said.The Waqf (Amendment) Bill was passed last week by the Rajya Sabha with 128 votes in favour and 95 against, after the Lok Sabha cleared it with 288 votes for and 232 against. The legislation has now received assent from President Droupadi Murmu","Naveen Patnaik came out in strong defence of his close aide VK Pandian.

NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Wednesday responded sharply to criticism over his recent interaction with Union ministers, particularly his stroll with minister Kiren Rijiju at Srinagar's Tulip Garden by the Dal Lake.The backlash from Valley leaders comes after the passage of contentious Waqf Amendment Act in Parliament.In his remarks, Abdullah clarified the encounter, saying, “It is right that two days ago, I took my father to the Tulip Garden. It is a coincidence that a Union minister was present there at the moment. We greeted each other. He wanted to get a picture with me, how could I refuse?”Dismissing the criticism as politically motivated, he added, “Now, those who gave BJP an entry into J&K are trying to use that against me. Those who have not apologised to the people of J&K for what happened in 2016, should first take a look into their own actions and the price J&K had to pay for their alliance with the BJP.”His comments come as leaders like PDP’s Mehbooba Mufti accused Abdullah of legitimising the Centre’s unilateral decisions. “The chief minister’s actions not only deepened the sense of alienation and helplessness within the Muslim community but also lent legitimacy to this unilateral decision widely perceived as dismissive of their interests,” she said, urging the assembly to pass a resolution rejecting the bill.""The drama created by the ruling party in the assembly from the last three days, and what we saw in the Tulip Garden, is shameful. The BJP is attacking the Muslims of the country left, right, and centre. By welcoming and entertaining Union Minister Kiren Rijiju, the CM has sent a message to all Muslims of the country that J&K government supports Waqf Amendment,"" Mufti said later to ANI news agency.Echoing her, People’s Conference leader Sajad Lone said Abdullah should have distanced himself from Rijiju as a symbolic protest. “There was no need to meet him.

"Kash Patel: Indian-origin Kash Patel ousted as acting ATF chief, replaced by Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kash-patel-removed-as-acting-atf-chief-replaced-by-army-secretary-daniel-driscoll/articleshow/120140580.cms,"File photo: FBI Director Kash Patel (Picture credit: ANI)

FBI Director Kash Patel has been quietly removed as acting director of the bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) and replaced by US Army secretary Daniel Driscoll , in a leadership shuffle that was not publicly disclosed by the justice department, news agency Reuters reported.Patel, who was controversially holding two top posts in the Justice Department, both FBI director and acting ATF chief, was sworn in to lead the ATF on February 24, just three days after assuming leadership at the FBI.However, his time at ATF appears to have ended in late February, though his name and photo remained on the agency’s website as of Wednesday afternoon and were still featured in an official ATF press release dated April 7, according to Reuters.A justice department official confirmed Patel’s removal but insisted it was not related to job performance. “Director Patel was briefly designated ATF Director while awaiting Senate confirmations, a standard, short-term move,” White House spokesman Harrison Fields was quoted as saying by Reuters.“Director Patel is now excelling in his role at the FBI and delivering outstanding results”, Fields added.The decision to install Army secretary Daniel Driscoll as acting ATF director caught many off guard. Driscoll, who remains in his current military post, now oversees the ATF while also managing a $187 billion Army budget and more than 450,000 soldiers around the world.As per news agency AP, the dual role is unusual, given the longstanding US policy to maintain a strict divide between military operations and domestic law enforcement.Driscoll, 38, previously served as an adviser to Vice President JD Vance and ran unsuccessfully in a North Carolina congressional primary in 2020. His appointment came without public announcement, and even senior ATF leaders were informed only this week, according to AP.Patel’s sudden appointment in February as ATF chief shocked career employees. When he arrived at ATF headquarters, he urged staff to focus on targeting violent gang members but has rarely been seen since, current and former officials were cited as saying by Reuters.The abrupt leadership changes have fueled concerns about instability within the agency, which plays a key role in investigating gun crimes, arson, bombings and regulating the firearms industry.“To see them in the situation they’re in now is just really heartbreaking,” said Peter Forcelli , a former ATF assistant director was quoted by Reuters. “The fact they’re getting kicked around like a soccer ball is to me just incredibly disrespectful”, Forcelli added.The leadership reshuffle comes amid broader discussions inside the justice department about potentially merging the ATF with the Drug Enforcement Administration to cut costs and consolidate enforcement resources, a move that could reshape federal firearms and narcotics investigations nationwide.Meanwhile, attorney general Pam Bondi has launched a new task force focused on enforcing the Second Amendment, which will include the ATF and Civil Rights Division.Bondi and US President Donald Trump have moved to roll back gun regulations implemented during the Biden administration. Earlier this week, the ATF repealed its “zero tolerance” policy on revoking licenses of gun dealers who commit serious violations, a shift that had been previously championed by Patel in a press release.The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the leading gun industry trade group, praised Driscoll’s appointment on Wednesday, saying it “signals a resolve to bring reform to ATF and protect the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens”.","FBI Director Kash Patel has been quietly removed as acting director of the bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

‘We cannot wait until night time,’ cry grieving families

The death toll in the catastrophic nightclub collapse in the Dominican Republic has risen to at least 184, as desperate families continue to wait for news about missing loved ones. The incident occurred on Tuesday.Video footage circulating on social media showed he moment just before the roof collapsed, crushing hundreds of nightclub-goers under tonnes of debris.Rescuers officially ended the search for survivors late Wednesday and shifted their focus to recovery efforts.The collapse occurred early Tuesday at Jet Set, a nightclub in southern Santo Domingo, during a merengue concert by singer Rubby Pérez, who also died in the disaster.The nightclub was hosting musicians, politicians, professional athletes and celebrities. It was filled with dancing and music when the ceiling gave way without warning — sending tonnes of concrete crashing down on hundreds of guests.Witnesses say dust began falling from the roof and into drinks shortly after the show began, but no one expected the entire structure to give way.Many victims were instantly crushed or trapped under the rubble, with emergency services receiving over 100 calls from people buried inside the club. Rescuers from Puerto Rico and Israel joined local teams to pull out 145 survivors, but over 20 remain hospitalised, including at least eight in critical condition.“They spent hours under rubble with multiple injuries, bleeding and fractures,” said Dr Julio Landrón, director of the Dr Ney Arias Lora Trauma Hospital . “None of them are in the clear.”Only 54 victims have been identified so far. At the National Institute of Forensic Pathology, dozens of people waited overnight. Some wore masks because of the strong smell, while many held photos of missing loved ones and begged officials for information.“We cannot wait until nighttime!” cried one woman. “We're going to go crazy!”Some of the dead include Rubby Pérez, his saxophonist Luis Solís, former MLB pitcher Octavio Dotel, Dominican player Tony Enrique Blanco Cabrera, fashion designer Martín Polanco, and a retired UN official. Nelsy Cruz , governor of Montecristi province and sister of MLB All-Star Nelson Cruz , called the president from beneath the rubble before later succumbing to her injuries in hospital.Other victims include an Army captain, the president of AFP Popular Bank and his wife, and several bartenders from Venezuela.The collapse of Jet Set has sent shockwaves through the country and beyond. Meanwhile, a psychological support commission has been set up for survivors and grieving families.“This is a very traumatic situation,” said national lawmaker Pedro Martínez, who is also searching for missing relatives.Authorities are yet to determine why the roof collapsed. The nightclub, which opened in 1973 and was renovated in 2010 and 2015, had also been struck by lightning in 2023. Jet Set’s owners say they are cooperating with authorities, but no inspection records have been released, and government offices have referred questions back and forth.","The death toll in the nightclub collapse in the Dominican Republic has risen to 184.

Famous North Korean assassin who became pastor in South following failed 1968 mission dies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/famous-north-korean-assassin-who-became-pastor-in-south-following-failed-1968-mission-dies/articleshow/120143428.cms,"SEOUL: Kim Shin-jo, a prominent ex-North Korean commando who resettled in South Korea as a pastor after his daring mission to assassinate then South Korean President Park Chung-hee in 1968 failed, died on Wednesday. He was 82. Kim died of old age after two months of stay at a nursing home and his official funeral is set for Saturday, Kim's Sungrak Church in Seoul said. It said Kim was survived by his wife, whom he met after resettling in South Korea, and a son and a daughter.Kim was among a team of 31 North Korean commandos who tried to storm South Korea's mountainside presidential palace to assassinate Park, an authoritarian president who had been ruling South Korea with an iron-fist since 1961.The North Koreans had slipped undetected through the Koreas' heavily fortified border and came within striking distance of Park's palace. After battles that raged for two weeks in the nearby hills, all but three of the intruders were killed. Two survivors were believed to have returned to North Korea, while Kim was the only one captured alive by South Korean forces.In a news conference arranged by South Korean authorities, Kim stunned the nation by saying that his team came ""to slit the throat of Park Chung-hee"".The attack, which also killed about 30 South Koreans, happened at the height of Cold War rivalry between the rival Koreas which were split into the US-backed South and the Soviet-supported North at the end of World War II in 1945. Afterward, Park's government launched reservist forces, established a military unit tasked with attacking North Korea, had students take military training at schools and introduced residential registration card systems.In media interviews, Kim said he was pardoned because he didn't fire a single bullet during the shootouts and was persuaded by South Korean officials to disavow communism. He said South Korean intelligence authorities later had him travel across the country to make speeches critical of North Korean systems at schools, companies and other places.Kim said he later learned that his parents in North Korea were executed. Kim was ordained as a pastor in 1997.Kim said the 1968 attack was made at the order of North Korea founder and then-leader Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of current ruler Kim Jong Un . Kim Il Sung died of heart attack in 1994, handing over power to his son Kim Jong Il , the father of Kim Jong Un.""I earlier didn't know why Kim Il Sung wanted to kill President Park,"" Kim Shin-jo said in a 2009 interview with the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper. ""But I came to know the reason as I spent time here. Kim must have been afraid of a poor country such as South Korea becoming rich. As the economy improved, South Korea would secure more money to buy weapons. From Kim Il Sung's perspective, he couldn't help killing President Park to achieve communization of South Korea.""But in a 2007 autobiography by Park Geun-hye, daughter of Park Chung-hee who became South Korea's first woman president in 2013, the younger Park said when she met Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang in 2002, he said the 1968 attack was orchestrated by ""extremists"" and he apologised for it. Park Geun-hye said Kim Jong Il told her that they all received unspecified due punishments.Those comments couldn't be independently verified.",Kim Shin-jo was among a team of 31 North Korean commandos who tried to storm South Korea's presidential palace in 1968.

South Korea 's opposition leader Lee Jae-myung announced his presidential candidacy on Thursday, claiming his commitment to address inequality and boost economic development.The presidential election is scheduled for June 3, following the impeachment confirmation of former president Yoon Suk Yeol , who had declared martial law in December.Through a Thursday announcement quoted by Reuters, Lee addressed economic disparity as a fundamental cause of social discord, noting its role in intensifying recent political instability following Yoon's martial law implementation. Lee, positioning himself as a practical leader, emphasised that a policy's effectiveness matters more than its originator.While conservative opponents suggest the opposition might weaken US relations and jeopardise Japanese diplomatic progress, Lee maintained his practical diplomatic stance, stating: ""Realistically speaking, the South Korea-US alliance is important, and South Korea, US Japan cooperation is important. Within that, the consistent principle is the national interest of the Republic of Korea is the top priority.""At 61, Lee had experienced a narrow defeat against Yoon in the 2022 presidential election. However, he subsequently led his liberal Democratic Party to significant parliamentary victory and maintains strong liberal support. He resigned from his opposition leadership role on Wednesday to concentrate on his election campaign.An April 4 Gallup poll showed Lee leading with 34% support, whilst conservative candidate Kim Moon-soo, the 73-year-old former labour minister, received 9%. The conservative presidential nomination remains competitive, with the ruling People Power Party planning to select its candidate through May primaries.","South Korea's opposition leader Lee Jae-myung announced his presidential candidacy on Thursday.

JUST IN: Trump Signs Exec. Orders To Launch Probe Of 'Anonymous' Author Miles Taylor, Chris Krebbs

US president Donald Trump signed two memoranda on Wednesday directing the justice department to investigate former officials Miles Taylor and Chris Krebs , while also targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey involved in litigation against his allies.The move marks a sharp escalation in Trump’s campaign to punish critics from his first term. Taylor and Krebs had both publicly criticised Trump, with Taylor even authoring an anonymous 2018 op-ed.Both Taylor and Krebs served in Trump's first term and later became his outspoken critics. Trump also revoked any remaining security clearances for the two.Miles Taylor, a former official at the department of homeland security, became widely known after he admitted to writing a 2018 anonymous op-ed in The New York Times. The piece described internal efforts to resist Trump’s decisions, calling some of them dangerous. Taylor also published a book under the pen name “Anonymous” and revealed his identity in 2020. On Wednesday, Trump accused him of treason and spying.Taylor responded on X, saying, “Dissent isn’t unlawful. It certainly isn’t treasonous. America is headed down a dark path.”Chris Krebs, who led the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency, was fired by Trump after he said the 2020 election was secure. Krebs had publicly contradicted Trump’s claims of election fraud.Susman Godfrey, the law firm Trump targeted, had represented Dominion Voting Systems in its defamation lawsuit against Fox News.

Duke Of Sussex Security Court Battle: No reunion for Prince Harry and King Charles during Duke’s UK visit for security court battle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/no-reunion-for-prince-harry-and-king-charles-during-dukes-uk-visit-for-security-court-battle/articleshow/120107386.cms,"No reunion for Prince Harry and King Charles during Duke’s UK visit for security court battle (Picture credit: AP)

Prince Harry made a rare return to the UK this week for a legal showdown over his government-funded security, but his visit came and went without any meeting with his father, King Charles III, further hinting at the deepening rift within the royal family.The Duke of Sussex arrived in London on Sunday for a Court of Appeal hearing related to his long-running legal fight against the 2020 decision to remove his state-funded police protection. Despite being in close proximity to his father, no meeting took place before the King and Queen Camilla departed for a state visit to Italy early Monday.According to sources cited by Fox News Digital, a reunion was ""never a realistic option.""Royal commentator Kinsey Schofield was also quoted by Fox News saying, ""There is too much tension… the royal family simply cannot trust him today."" Another royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams, told the outlet, “It’s sad, it’s public, and it presages trouble in the future, especially if Harry wins his appeal.”Their last confirmed meeting was in February 2024 when Harry flew to London briefly after the monarch’s cancer diagnosis. At the time, Harry expressed hope that the health crisis might mend their strained relationship. “Any illness, any sickness, brings families together… and that makes me very happy,” he said in an interview with Good Morning America.But according to The Sun, even though Charles was in London for treatment over the weekend, the pair did not reunite. The monarch left for Rome just hours after Harry landed.A royal insider was quoted by People magazine that Charles had stopped responding to Harry’s calls and letters, and the King is reportedly “frustrated” by Harry’s belief that he can influence security decisions, something Buckingham Palace insists is beyond the monarch’s authority.In court, Harry’s lawyer Shaheed Fatima argued that his “bespoke” security arrangements were “unjustified and inferior,” and that a government committee failed to properly assess threats to his safety. She cited two serious incidents, a call by al-Qaeda for Harry’s assassination and the 2023 paparazzi chase in New York involving him and Meghan Markle.The Prince, 40, and his wife Meghan stepped down from royal duties in 2020 and now live in California. Since then, Harry has fought to retain security protection in the UK, arguing he cannot safely visit without it. He lost a previous attempt to personally pay for police protection, with a judge ruling that police officers cannot be used as “private bodyguards for the wealthy.”Harry’s relationship with his family, particularly with Charles and Prince William, remains tense.As per Fox News, the Prince’s efforts to maintain equal status with his brother, the heir to the throne, are believed to be a source of friction. Royal biographer Ingrid Seward told the outlet, “The King probably hasn’t got the inclination, and he probably hasn’t got the energy” for a difficult conversation with his son.King Charles is currently in Italy on official duty and celebrating his 20th wedding anniversary with Queen Camilla during the trip. Meanwhile, Prince Harry’s legal battle continues, with a written verdict on his appeal expected in the coming weeks.","Prince Harry and King Charles III did not reunite during Duke's UK visit for security court battle.

USCIS goes full throttle: Perceived antisemitic content will result in visa and green card denials,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/uscis-goes-full-throttle-perceived-antisemitic-content-will-result-in-visa-and-green-card-denials/articleshow/120135325.cms,"US says will deny visas over anti-semitic protests. (AP photo)

The writing was already on the wall – social media activity was being scrutinised and immigrants, including foreign students, were facing the brunt for any activity or post that could be perceived as a national security concern, even tangentially.The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in a release today has made this official. It states, “Today, USCIS will begin considering aliens’ antisemitic activity on social media and the physical harassment of Jewish individuals as grounds for denying immigration benefit requests. This will immediately affect aliens applying for lawful permanent resident status, foreign students and aliens affiliated with educational institutions linked to antisemitic activity.”In other words, international students, those applying for green card status, and those seeking non-immigrant work visas (including H-1B) for jobs affiliated with educational institutions that are perceived as being antisemitic will be impacted and their visa applications denied.TOI in its edition of March 30 had reported that, hundreds of international students had faced repercussions – it was not just active college activism condemning the killings of civilians and children in Gaza, but even sharing of a social media post or liking a post that seemingly led to arbitrary revocation of their F1 visa and termination of their records on SEVIS. Marco Rubio , Secretary of State, has earlier confirmed revocation of visas of 300 foreign students. TOI had also mentioned that even new visa applications are being subjected to social media scrutiny, based on which applicants will be denied the opportunity to study in the US.“Under this guidance, USCIS will consider social media content that indicates an alien endorsing, espousing, promoting, or supporting antisemitic terrorism, antisemitic terrorist organizations, or other antisemitic activity as a negative factor in any USCIS discretionary analysis when adjudicating immigration benefit requests. This guidance is effective immediately,” adds the release.Immigration attorneys are taken aback by this release and many fear that applicants could face visa denials or revocation of existing visas based on online activity that is taken out of context.Rajiv S. Khanna, an immigration attorney said, “The guidance is vaguely worded. Even the most innocent statement by someone expressing an honest opinion could be taken to be a violation of the government’s interpretation of acceptable norms.””“First amendment rights are available to everybody in the US, not just US citizens,” he added.Elissa Taub, an immigration attorney said, “Our country’s vetting of applicants for these statuses (aka students, green card applicants, non-immigrant workers) already looks for and keeps out suspected terrorists. The government already has the power to review social media accounts. Announcing this policy, the way USCIS did is aggressive. It provides no guardrails or standards for the administration’s’ persecution of people whose opinions they don’t like…”The USCIS release adds that :Consistent with President Trump’s executive orders on Combating anti-semitism, Additional measures to combat anti-semitism and Protecting the United States from foreign terrorists and other national security and public safety threads, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will enforce all relevant immigration laws to the maximum degree, to protect the homeland from extremists and terrorist aliens, including those who support antisemitic terrorism, violent antisemitic ideologies and antisemitic terrorist organizations such as Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, or Ansar Allah aka: “the Houthis.”“There is no room in the United States for the rest of the world’s terrorist sympathizers, and we are under no obligation to admit them or let them stay here,” said Tricia McLaughlin , Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at DHS. “Secretary Noem has made it clear that anyone who thinks they can come to America and hide behind the First Amendment to advocate for anti-Semitic violence and terrorism – think again. You are not welcome here,” her statement said.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in a release today has made this official.

The Trump administration moved Wednesday to drop its case against a man who it described two weeks earlier as a leader of the Salvadoran gang MS-13 living illegally in the United States , court records showed.In a statement, Attorney General Pam Bondi described 24-year-old Henrry Josue Villatoro Santos as a ""terrorist"" and said he would ""now face the removal process.""Santos was charged in late March with being an undocumented alien in possession of a firearm, and was described at the time by US President Donald Trump as a ""major leader of MS-13"" -- a Latin America-based gang designated a foreign terrorist organization by Washington.On Wednesday, prosecutors asked a federal court to dismiss the gun charges complaint against Santos in a single-page filing, without providing further details.Earlier, Bondi told a televised news conference the suspect was from El Salvador and was in the United States illegally, adding he ""will not be living in our country much longer.""She described him as one of the top three MS-13 leaders in the United States, saying that he was responsible for East Coast operations and was arrested in Virginia.The Washington Post , citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reported that US authorities dropped the case in order to fast-track Santos's removal from the United States.Bondi's statement appeared to confirm that conclusion.Trump has sought to target predominantly Hispanic criminal groups operating in the United States since he returned to the White House in January, alongside a broader clampdown on illegal immigration.His heavy-handed approach has, however, drawn backlash from Democrats and rights groups.Last week, officials admitted that an ""administrative error"" had seen a man mistakenly deported to a notorious El Salvador prison with hundreds of other alleged gang members in mid-March.A separate reported case of a gay barber being deported has attracted US media attention, and attorneys for several deportees say their clients were targeted only because of their tattoos.","US prosecutors ask a federal court to dismiss the gun charges complaint against Henrry Josue Villatoro Santos.

Federal appeals court allows Trump administration to resume firing probationary workers

A federal appeals court has ruled in favour of the Trump administration on Wednesday, allowing it to proceed with the dismissal of thousands of probationary federal employees. This overturns a previous court order in Baltimore that had required reinstatement.The court ruled that the employees’ terminations should be challenged through the federal employment process rather than through the courts.The decision is part of a broader legal battle involving multiple states and ongoing lawsuits over the legality of mass terminations under Trump’s federal workforce reforms.The panel of three judges was divided. Two Republican-appointed judges backed the administration, while the third, appointed by a Democrat, dissented.The lawsuit, filed by nearly two dozen states, argued that the sudden job losses placed a heavy financial and administrative burden on them, as they would be forced to support thousands of newly unemployed workers.Since Trump took office, around 24,000 probationary employees have reportedly been dismissed. Though some 15,000 of those employees had already been reinstated or placed on paid leave during the legal proceedings, the ruling now allows the administration to continue with the dismissals.The Supreme Court also sided with the Trump administration on Tuesday in a separate but related case. It blocked a decision by judge William Alsup in San Francisco that had supported reinstatement, stating that the nonprofit organisations involved lacked legal standing. That case still continues, as other plaintiffs, including the state of Washington and several labour groups, seek further review.",Federal appeals court allows Trump administration to resume firing probationary workers.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) defended his decision to raise tariffs on China to 125 per cent, stating, ""somebody had to do it.""The President, during his meeting with Roger Penske 's NASCAR , INDY, and IMSA Champions at the White House, emphasised that no other US leader would have taken such a bold stance, highlighting that the tariff hike was necessary as the previous trade imbalance with China was ""unsustainable"".He pointed out that in the previous year, China made USD 1 trillion off trade with the US and that he had ""reversed it"" through his aggressive tariff strategy.""Well, I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. No other President would have done what I did... Somebody had to do it. It had to stop because it's not sustainable. Last year, China made USD 1 trillion off trade with the United States... Now I've reversed it,"" Trump said.Speaking on the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs to over 75 countries, President Trump remarked, ""I did a 90-day pause for the people who didn't retaliate because I told them if they retaliate, we're going to double it. And that's what I did with China because they did retaliate.""He expressed confidence that the trade situation would ""work out amazingly"" for the US in the long term, adding that by the end of the year, or possibly sooner, the country would have an agreement that ""nobody would have dreamt possible"".The President also addressed the trade situation with the European Union (EU), claiming that the EU had not been fair to the United States.""A deal is going to be made with everyone and they will be fair deals... They weren't fair to the United States. They were sucking us dry and you can't do that... People took advantage of our country and ripped us off for decades,"" Trump said, signalling his intent to negotiate better terms with the EU.In a lighter moment during his remarks, President Trump also praised the racing champions for their ""courage"" during a celebration of championship racing owner Roger Penske's career and life. He quipped about the high speeds of the NASCAR machines, saying, ""These are great champions, and this is a great sport.""Trump also recalled an experience of riding around the track in ""The Beast"", the US President's armoured limousine, ahead of the Daytona 500, describing the crowd's ""going crazy"" from inside the vehicle.""I wouldn't ride in that thing if you paid me,"" he further joked, referring to the IndyCar machine.Earlier, President Trump announced an immediate increase in tariffs on China to 125 per cent and simultaneously announced that for 75 countries that have called Representatives of the United States for trade talks, he has authorised a 90-day ""pause"" and a substantially lower reciprocal tariff.This came after China, in a retaliatory move, announced that it would increase its tariff on US goods from 34 per cent to 84 per cent starting April 10, as reported by Al Jazeera.The decision comes after the US increased tariffs on China to a whopping 104 per cent, following President Trump's threat of ""additional 50 per cent tariffs"" on Beijing starting Wednesday.Trump had announced an additional 50 per cent tariff on China after Beijing announced a 34 per cent tariff on the United States in a tit-for-tat response.","US President Donald Trump defended his decision to raise tariffs on China to 125 per cent, stating, ""somebody had to do it"" The President emphasised that no other US leader would have taken such a bold stance.

US Congress failed to pass a crucial budget resolution on Wednesday, delaying President Donald Trump ’s sweeping tax cut proposals. Internal disagreements among Republicans, particularly House conservatives demanding deeper spending cuts, forced leadership to cancel the vote.The delay threatens Trump’s broader agenda, including border security and energy plans, while exposing tensions within the GOP’s slim House majority. Despite controlling both the House and Senate , Republicans could not unite behind a common plan.Fiscal conservatives in the House opposed the version passed by the Senate on Saturday, saying it lacked sufficient spending cuts. Without an identical resolution from both chambers, the broader tax and spending agenda cannot move forward.Speaker Mike Johnson , who was confident the bill would pass, acknowledged the lack of consensus from his narrow 220–213 majority. “I don’t think we’re going to have a vote tonight... maybe we take a little more time,” he told reporters.The failed vote was a blow to Trump, who had personally met around two dozen doubtful House members at the White House on Tuesday to convince them to support his “one big beautiful bill.” While Trump promised deeper spending reductions, the internal GOP divisions remained.Speaking at the National Republican Congressional Committee’s annual dinner a day earlier, Trump urged dissenting lawmakers to support the bill, saying, “You have to get there.”The House version of the resolution proposed $1.5 trillion in cuts and raised the borrowing limit by $4 trillion. In contrast, the Senate version allowed only $4 billion in reductions and a $5 trillion debt ceiling increase. House Budget Committee Chair Jodey Arrington criticised the Senate’s approach, calling it “unserious and disappointing.”The Senate passed the bill early Saturday in a close 51-48 vote, mostly along party lines.","Internal disagreements among Republicans forced leadership to cancel the vote.

Trump signs executive order to deregulate Biden's water pressure mandate

In a move that blends regulatory rollback with a splash of satire, President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday redefining the federal standards for showerheads—a cause he has championed for years. The directive, as described by the Trump White House , aims to ""end the Obama-Biden war on water pressure"" and restore what it called “shower freedom” to the American people.“By restoring shower freedom, President Trump is following through on his commitment to dismantle unnecessary regulations and put Americans first,” the White House said in a statement announcing the new rule. The changes would also apply to other household fixtures like sinks and toilets.Trump has often expressed frustration with modern water-conservation appliances. “In my case, I like to take a nice shower to take care of my beautiful hair,” he said while signing the order. “I have to stand under the shower for 15 minutes until it gets wet. It comes out drip, drip, drip. It’s ridiculous.”His fixation on water pressure isn't new. In remarks dating back to 2019, Trump claimed, “people are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once,” citing the allegedly poor performance of low-flow models. “When you go into these new homes with showers, the water drips down slowly, slowly,” he reiterated in 2023.Not everyone in the appliance world shares Trump’s concerns. “It was very striking that the White House memo included toilets and shower heads as a presidential priority. It really was something,” said Andrew deLaski , executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project. “But I think Donald Trump’s concerns are somewhat out of date, to tell you the truth.”During his first term, Trump pushed back on several energy efficiency rules, including tighter standards on light bulbs. At the time, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra called the move “another dim-witted move that will waste energy at the expense of our people and planet.”The Trump administration had previously created exemptions for dishwashers and showerheads that allowed for greater water usage—a policy later reversed under President Joe Biden . But the saga didn’t end there.“Biden undid this progress and the shower wars continued,” the Trump White House said on Wednesday, adding that the new executive order would “make America’s showers great again.”","President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday redefining the federal standards for showerheads.

Careless People

Sarah Wynn-Williams, who spent nearly seven years at Facebook (now Meta) as director of Global Public Policy , claimed in a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing that executives “repeatedly undermine US national security and betray American values,” reported Fox News .Her testimony echoed damning allegations made in her memoir, which quickly climbed into Amazon’s top 10 bestsellers despite reported pushback from Meta.“We are engaged in a high-stakes AI arms race against China, and during my time at Meta, company executives lied about what they were doing with the Chinese Communist Party to employees, shareholders, Congress , and the American public,” she stated during her opening remarks.Wynn-Williams said that Meta held confidential briefings with the Chinese Communist Party as far back as 2015, allegedly focusing on sensitive technologies like artificial intelligence. She also claimed Meta's work aided China’s progress in AI development, pointing to advancements such as DeepSeek.Among the most startling claims was that Meta removed the Facebook account of billionaire Chinese dissident Guo Wengui , who resides in the U.S., allegedly under pressure from Beijing. Meta justified the takedown by citing violations of its rules related to sharing personal information.Despite ongoing criticism, Meta issued a statement defending its public stance: “While Mark Zuckerberg himself was public about our interest in offering our services in China and details were widely reported beginning over a decade ago, the fact is this: we do not operate our services in China today.”In her testimony, Wynn-Williams said, “The greatest trick Mark Zuckerberg ever pulled was wrapping the American flag around himself and calling himself a patriot and saying he didn’t offer services in China while he spent the last decade building an $18 billion business there.”The former policy director argued that Meta’s leadership was driven by self-interest and power. “This is a man who wears many different costumes,” she said of Zuckerberg. “When I was there, he wanted the president of China to name his first child, he was learning Mandarin, he was censoring to his heart’s content.”“He continues to wrap the flag around himself as we move into the next era of artificial intelligence,” she added.She also noted Meta’s recent political maneuvering, claiming the company has shifted strategies in recent months to strengthen ties with President Donald Trump , following his reelection last November.“We don't know what the next costume is gonna be,” she said, “but it will be something different. It's whatever gets him closest to power.”","Sarah Wynn-Williams spent nearly seven years at Facebook (now Meta) as director of Global Public Policy.

US House approves bill to restrict district judges’ nationwide rulings on Trump policies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-house-approves-bill-to-restrict-district-judges-nationwide-rulings-on-trump-measures/articleshow/120142541.cms,".

The US House of Representatives passed a bill on Wednesday limiting federal district judges from issuing nationwide injunctions. The move, backed mainly by Republicans, follows repeated court blocks of Trump administration policies. The bill restricts judicial orders to only those directly involved in a case.The legislation would prevent judges from issuing nationwide injunctions—orders that currently allow a single court to block government policies across the entire country.The bill reflects growing Republican frustration over court decisions that have stalled or overturned policies from former President Donald Trump’s administration. These include actions like firing federal workers, freezing government funds, and shutting down federal offices. Most recently, judges in Texas and New York blocked the application of the Alien Enemies Act on detainees.Republicans argue that the judiciary is interfering too broadly and too often, calling it a form of judicial overreach. ""A single judge can block the entire ‘America first’ agenda. This must end,"" said Rep. Mark Harris of North Carolina. Others, like Rep. Bob Onder of Missouri, went as far as to call the situation a ""judicial coup.""Democrats counter that courts are stepping in because of unlawful or unconstitutional executive orders. They also point out that Republican-appointed judges have issued similar injunctions during Joe Biden ’s presidency, questioning the timing and intent behind the current bill. “If you don’t want injunctions, stop doing illegal things,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal Though the bill has cleared the House by a vote of 219-213, it is unlikely to pass in the Senate, where at least some Democratic support would be needed to overcome procedural hurdles. A similar bill introduced earlier also failed to advance.","The US House of Representatives passed a bill limiting federal district judges from issuing nationwide injunctions.

Judges in Texas and New York halt deportation of Venezuelans under wartime law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judges-in-texas-and-new-york-halt-deportation-of-venezuelans-under-wartime-law/articleshow/120142156.cms,"AP photo

What Texas, New York rulings mean for Trump's use of Alien Enemies Act

Federal judges in Texas and New York have temporarily blocked the US government from deporting five Venezuelan men held in detention. The court orders only apply to detainees in specific areas but could set a precedent for broader challenges.These rulings come amid legal challenges to the Trump administration’s use of the rarely applied Alien Enemies Act, which allows deportation or detention of noncitizens during wartime.The men have denied any ties to the Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua, and are being represented by civil rights lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).The Alien Enemies Act is a law that dates back to the 18th century and has only been used during the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II.The law permits the president to detain or deport noncitizens from countries the US is at war with. However, the US is not at war with Venezuela. Despite this, the Trump administration has labelled certain migrants as threats, alleging that gang members are “invading” the US. So far, over 100 Venezuelans have been deported without a chance to argue their case in court.The recent Supreme Court ruling allowed deportations under this law to continue but required that detainees receive basic legal rights before removal. In response, civil liberties lawyers are pushing for broader protections and have filed class action lawsuits on behalf of all similarly detained individuals.In Texas, Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr blocked deportations at El Valle Detention Center, where three men, including one with HIV, are being held. In New York, Judge Alvin Hellerstein issued a similar order for detainees in the Southern District, which covers Manhattan, the Bronx, and nearby counties.The ACLU has criticised the identification method used to label detainees as gang members, calling it unreliable. According to them, the system assigns points based on tattoos, clothing, and gestures, but lacks solid evidence. The organisation is now seeking a nationwide order to avoid fighting similar cases in every judicial district.Meanwhile, the Trump administration has indicated it plans to expand the use of the law to target members of other gangs, including MS-13.","Federal judges in Texas and New York have temporarily blocked the US government from deporting five Venezuelan men held in detention.

Poll Should the Pakistani military have a role in politics? No, it undermines democracy. Yes, they provide stability.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political landscape remains a battleground of competing forces, with the military, former prime minister Imran Khan, and the current govt under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif locked in a tense struggle.The interplay of US foreign policy and the Pakistani diaspora’s growing voice adds further complexity to a nation grappling with economic woes, security threats and democratic erosion.Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars. Convicted on corruption and state secret charges, the cricketer-turned-politician retains a fervent base, accusing the military and Sharif’s govt of colluding with the US to orchestrate his downfall.Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) alleges widespread rigging in the Feb 2024 elections, which saw Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) secure power through a fragile coalition. PTI supporters, galvanised by Khan’s claims, have staged protests, clashing with the security forces and deepening the political divide.The military, longtime kingmaker in Pakistani politics, appears to have shifted allegiance. Once Khan’s backer in his 2018 rise, the army soured on him after policy disputes and his public criticisms of General Asim Munir, the current army chief.Analysts suggest the military now props up Sharif’s govt, a dynamic evident in legislative moves like the 2023 Pakistan Army Act amendment, which stifled dissent and empowered the armed forces. This hybrid regime – blending electoral democracy with military influence – has drawn scrutiny for undermining constitutional norms, yet the generals show no sign of relinquishing their grip.However, Shehbaz Sharif, re-elected in March 2024 as PM, faces a legitimacy crisis. His coalition, including the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and other smaller factions, struggles to address surging militant attacks, crumbling infrastructure, and an economy reliant on IMF bailouts.Sharif vows to mend ties with Washington but his govt’s dependence on military support raises questions about its autonomy. Khan’s call for an election audit, echoed in a letter to the IMF, threatens to derail these efforts as Pakistan awaits a critical loan installment.The US role remains contentious. Khan’s unproven claims of a Washington-led conspiracy resonate with a populace wary of foreign interference, a sentiment rooted in decades of strained relations. The Biden administration, while engaging Sharif’s govt, has maintained robust military ties with Pakistan, prioritising counter-terrorism over democratic concerns. This ambivalence has fuelled Khan’s narrative, even as US officials dismiss his allegations.Meanwhile, the Pakistani diaspora, particularly in the US, has emerged as a vocal force. Pro-democracy activists, many aligned with PTI, have lobbied Congress, securing bipartisan support for resolutions condemning elections irregularities and Khan’s detention. Over 100 lawmakers have urged his release, while some advocate sanctions against military leaders like Munir. This diaspora-driven pressure marks a shift, challenging the traditional US-Pakistan security nexus.As Pakistan teeters between chaos and stability, the military’s shadow looms large, Khan’s defiance endures, and Sharif’s govt navigates a treacherous path. With the US and Pakistani diaspora adding external weight, the nation’s democratic future hangs in the balance.","Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars.

Poll Do you support the call for a long march by Sardar Akhtar Mengal? No, I do not support it. Yes, I support it.

ISLAMABAD: A tense standoff unfolded across Balochistan on Monday as a shutter-down strike and widespread road blockades sparked by nationalist leader Sardar Akhtar Mengal ’s call for a “long march” from Lakpass to Quetta paralysed the Pakistani province.The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists, including women leaders of Balochistan Yakjehti Committee (BYC), amid escalating clashes with authorities.Shops businesses and schools remained closed in cities like Quetta, Kalat, Mastung Khuzdar, and Gwadar. Mengal’s supporters blocked key highways, including the Quetta-Karachi national highway.The provincial govt’s deployment of containers, trenches, and police checkpoints at Lakpass, roughly 30 km from Quetta, stalled the march, forcing demonstrators onto rugged mountain routes.Reports of police using teargas and shelling BNP-M workers have intensified the unrest.Mengal, addressing a sit-in at Lakpass, accused the state of oppression and vowed to press forward. “The state may crush us, but we won’t bow,” he declared, signalling plans to escalate the march into province-wide resistance. The protest began March 28 in Wadh, Mengal’s hometown, following the arrest of BYC leaders, including Mahrang Baloch, during a crackdown on their Quetta sit-in. A suicide bombing near the rally on March 29 left Mengal unharmed but underscored the volatile stakes.Balochistan’s govt, led by chief minister Sarfraz Bugti, has taken a hard line. His spokesperson, Shahid Rind, warned Mengal of arrest under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Act if the march entered Quetta’s Red Zone.Negotiations have faltered, with Mengal dismissing the provincial govt’s delegations as powerless to meet demands. BYC, however, rallied behind Mengal, urging highway blockades and strikes to amplify pressure.Analysts see it as a critical juncture for Balochistan, where grievances over state repression, enforced disappearances and resource exploitation fuel dissent. The shutter-down has disrupted public life, with Quetta’s land links to 12 districts severed for over a week. With cellular networks down and security tightened, the province braces for what Mengal’s supporters call a defining fight.","The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists.

Who are the militant groups?



Poll Do you believe the rise in militant attacks in Pakistan is primarily due to the influence of groups based in Afghanistan? No, not at all Yes, definitely

Which are the most affected regions?



What are the consequences of the rising violence?



More than 100 deadly attacks in Pakistan by Islamist militants and separatist rebels made March the deadliest month over a decade with 335 people killed, a think tank reported Thursday.Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) think tank. They included 73 members of security services, including soldiers and police officers, 67 civilians and 88 militants.The Islamist-militant Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the separatist rebel Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) were the main militant groups responsible for the attacks.The BLA was responsible for a 28-hour hijacking of the train Jaffar Express in the southwestern region Balochistan. Some 450 people were held hostage and more than two dozen were killed.Balochistan was the most affected province, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the northwest of Pakistan.They have both also been targets of suicide bombings, a form of attacks that surged in March.In Punjab, the eastern province bordering India, the think tank observed a strong increase in militant activity.At least seven attacks were recorded, and most were attributed to the TTP.In response to the growing threat, Pakistan's security forces have intensified their operations in the region. Many people have been arrested with connections to militant groups, including the TTP.Islamabad claims that most attacks, both by militants and rebels, are planned and executed from Afghanistan. It accuses the neighboring country of granting Pakistani militants space to plan and organize attacks.A recent report by the United Nations supported this claim. It said that the Taliban provided support to the TTP and that some attacks were launched from Afghan territory.As a consequence, the Pakistani government has urged the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan to act against the allegedly responsible criminals. Kabul, on the other hand, denies that the militants are in Afghanistan.","Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.

The former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize , recognising his contributions to human rights and democratic values.The nomination was announced by members of the Pakistan World Alliance (PWA), an advocacy organisation established in December, who are also affiliated with the Norwegian political party Partiet Sentrum.""We are pleased to announce on behalf of Partiet Sentrum that in alliance with somebody with the right to nominate, have nominated Imran Khan, the former prime minister of Pakistan, to the Nobel Peace Prize for his work with human rights and democracy in Pakistan,"" Partiet Sentrum posted on X on Sunday.Previously also, Khan received a Nobel Peace Prize nomination in 2019 for his endeavours to foster peace across South Asia.Strangely in his own country, the Centre has claimed that Imran Khan orchestrated the riots in the country.The Norwegian Nobel Committee evaluates hundreds of nominations annually through an extensive eight-month selection process before choosing a winner, according to The Express Tribune.Khan, who established Pakistan's primary opposition party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), has been in custody since August 2023.In January, authorities sentenced Khan to 14 years' imprisonment for corruption and misuse of authority charges.This verdict marked his fourth significant conviction.Higher courts have since overturned or suspended three previous convictions related to state gift sales, state secret disclosures, and marriage irregularities.Following a no-confidence vote in April 2022, Khan was removed from office. He maintains his innocence, asserting that the charges are politically driven.","Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to human rights and democratic values.

Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.The operation, in Katlang, a remote hilltop area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, was aimed at militant hideouts and resulted in the deaths of 12 suspected terrorists.

'Police have swiftly moved to take action,' says Yunus

At least 72 people were arrested across Bangladesh on Wednesday for their involvement in vandalism and looting during large-scale anti-Israel protests held earlier this week, reports Dhaka Tribune.Demonstrations erupted in multiple cities, including the capital Dhaka, on Monday as thousands took to the streets to condemn Israel’s continued military actions in Gaza. Protesters from various political, social, religious, cultural, and professional organisations joined forces in what organisers described as part of a global movement supporting Palestinians.However, the protests turned violent when, in cities like Bogra, Sylhet, Cox’s Bazar and others, mobs vandalised shops and businesses, with some targeting outlets perceived to have ties to Israel. Businesses such as Bata, KFC and Pizza Hut came under attack as demonstrators called for a boycott of Israeli-affiliated products.The rallies saw widespread student participation, with many skipping classes and exams to march in solidarity. Protesters waved Palestinian flags, held up placards, and set ablaze an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Chants denouncing American backing for Israel and frustration over the inaction of international bodies like the United Nations, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and Arab League echoed through the streets.However, while many gatherings remained peaceful, some turned violent, leading to incidents of property damage and theft.Bangladesh's interim chief advisor Muhammad Yunus addressed the unrest in a statement posted on X. “Bangladesh police have swiftly moved to take action over the violent and unlawful events that unfolded during the Pro-Gaza protests in several cities on Monday,” he wrote. “These attacks and acts of vandalism are an affront to public safety and the rule of law.”He further confirmed that at least 60 individuals had initially been arrested.In an earlier X post on Monday, Yunus strongly condemned Israel’s actions in Gaza: “The Government of Bangladesh expresses its strongest condemnation of the Israeli Occupying Forces’ continued mass killing and gross violations of human rights in the Gaza Strip.”He referred to the situation as a “human catastrophe,” noting that Israel’s breach of ceasefire agreements had led to the deaths of scores of Palestinians—many of them women and children—while also blocking humanitarian aid.According to Gaza’s health ministry, since October 7, 2023, over 50,000 people have been killed and at least 115,000 injured as a result of the ongoing conflict. Ceasefire efforts have repeatedly failed, with both sides accusing each other of violations despite mounting international pressure.","At least 72 people were arrested across Bangladesh on Wednesday for their involvement in vandalism and looting during large-scale anti-Israel protests.

She described Yunus as someone who never loved the people and loaned out small amounts at high interest rates and used the money to live a lavish life abroad.She said rapes, murders and robberies cannot be reported for fear that if they are, the TV channel or newspaper will be targeted.","Former PM Sheikh Hasina has alleged that interim govt chief Muhammad Yunus has turned peaceful Bangladesh into a country of militants and terrorists.

Demonstrations broke out across Bangladesh, including Dhaka city, on Monday protesting against Israeli actions in Gaza. Different organisations spanning political, social, cultural, religious and professional spheres took to Dhaka's streets in protest.The demonstrations form part of worldwide protests against attacks on Palestinians in Gaza, according to organisers. Students have stayed away from classes and examinations to join the protests.Muhammad Yunus, chief advisor of interim government in Bangladesh, said in a statement on X, ""The Government of Bangladesh expresses its strongest condemnation of the Israeli Occupying Forces’ continued mass killing and gross violations of human rights in the Gaza Strip. Israel’s ongoing military attacks since last month's unilateral breach of the ceasefire have killed scores of Palestinians, mostly women and children as well as blocked the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza leading to a human catastrophe. Evidently, Israel has shown no regard to repeated international appeals and has instead engaged in an increasingly intense killing spree.""Workers and professionals went on strike with organisers asking people to stop buying Israeli products.""We support humanity first of all. The things that Israel has been doing to Palestine to remove their identity from the world are brutally bad. As a human, if I don't support Palestine right now, my humanity will be lost,"" stated a Dhaka University student participant.Protesters voiced strong opposition to American support for Israel's Gaza offensive, whilst criticising the inaction of bodies like the UN, OIC and Arab League.Responding about American involvement, she said, ""They have been doing this for power, nothing else. If they had humanity in their hearts, they would not be doing this to the people right now. We are demanding to stop the genocide and to stop the killing of people.""Palestinian flags, solidarity placards, and setting fire to Netanyahu's effigy were all part of the Bangladeshi protest.The USA faces criticism over Trump's suggested forced Palestinian relocation for Gaza's reconstruction. Arab countries reject this plan, whilst human rights groups term it ethnic cleansing. Protesters also opposed American suppression of pro-Palestinian activities at universities, Al Jazeera reports.57 people died and 137 were wounded in the past 24 hours, according to Gaza authorities. Since March 18, Israeli attacks have caused 1,391 deaths and 3,434 injuries.
