PM Modi Responds To Donald Trump’s 'Will Always Be Friends' Remark, Says India-US Ties Remain Strong

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he looks forward to speak with his ""very good friend"" Prime Minister Modi in the coming weeks and confirmed that his administration will continue negotiations with India to resolve trade barriers between the two countries.Sharing a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""I am pleased to announce that India, and the United States of America, are continuing negotiations to address the Trade Barriers between our two Nations. I look forward to speaking with my very good friend, Prime Minister Modi, in the upcoming weeks.""""I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our Great Countries!"" he added.The remarks come after Trump had earlier softened his tone on India-US relations, calling the ties ""very special,"" affirming his friendship with PM Modi on Friday.Earlier, speaking at the White House Trump had said that, ""I always will. I'll always be friends with (PM) Modi. He's a great Prime Minister. I'll always be friends, but I just don't like what he is doing at this particular moment.""""But India and the United States have a very special relationship.There is nothing to worry about. We just have moments on occasion,"" he added.Following Trump’s statement, PM Modi responded warmly on Saturday, saying he ""deeply appreciates and fully reciprocates President Trump's sentiments and positive assessment of our ties.""However, Trump's Trade adviser Peter Navarro on Monday renewed his attack on India and warned that it ""won't end well"" if New Delhi doesn't ""come around"" at some point in trade negotiations with the United States.In his interview with 'Real America Voice', Navarro reiterated that India is ""Maharaja"" of tariffs.""But it's absolutely true. They have the highest tariffs in any major country in the world against the United States. We got to deal with that,"" Navarro said.""I think India must come around at some point. And if it doesn't, it's lying down with Russia and China, and that won't end well for India,"" he added.Navarro has repeatedly attacked India in the past few weeks for ""profiteering"" from Russian crude by reselling its refined form in the international market.The shift in Trump's tone comes after his administration’s imposed 25% tariffs on Indian goods, plus an additional 25% on India’s Russian oil imports, bringing total duties to 50%.","US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he looks forward to speaking with his ""very good friend"" Prime Minister Modi.

Nepal unrest: Gen Z fury unseats Prime Minister; wife of ex-PM dies after home set afire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/nepal-unrest-gen-z-fury-unseats-prime-minister-wife-of-ex-pm-dies-after-home-set-afire/articleshow/123797045.cms,"'KP CHOR': Thousands Of Gen Z Protesters Set Nepal Parliament On Fire; Oli ‘Runs For Life’

Poll Do you think the protests will lead to positive change in Nepal? Yes, they could bring positive change No, it will only cause more problems

Fear of crimes, further instability stalks Nepal







Less than 24 hours after police gunfire left 19 people dead outside its parliament, Nepal PM K P Sharma Oli resigned Tuesday as protests against corruption and censorship spiralled into the most violent unrest the Himalayan nation has seen in years. The Nepal army declared that it would assume responsibility for law and order from 10pm.By Tuesday afternoon, protesters stormed the federal parliament building inside the Singha Durbar complex, shattering windows and setting fires in multiple chambers. Flames rose as young demonstrators danced and chanted. ""This building never worked for us,"" said Mira Thapa, a 20-year-old student waving a Nepali flag. ""Burning it down means we can build something new.""The fury spread to the homes of senior politicians. Foreign minister Arzu Rana Deuba, wife of former PM Sher Bahadur Deuba, was dragged from her residence and beaten by a mob. ""They kept shouting that we had stolen their future,"" she later told aides. Deuba was also assaulted. Deputy PM and finance minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel was chased through the streets by protesters who kicked and struck him. Former PM Jhalanath Khanal's wife, Rajyalaxmi Chitrakar, was killed after protesters torched their home.Party officials confirmed her death late Tuesday, calling it a barbaric act that reflected the dangerous turn of the movement.Officials at the Civil Service Hospital in Kathmandu confirmed by evening that the toll had risen to 22, with more than 300 injured in clashes and stampedes across the city.In a statement, the army warned that ""taking undue advantage of the adverse situation, some groups have been causing excessive damage to ordinary citizens and public property, as well as engaging in looting and arson. To prevent such activities, the army, along with all other security agencies, will assume primary responsibility of maintaining law and order for safety of Nepal and Nepalis.""The bloodshed came three days after govt abruptly revoked a blanket ban on 26 social media platforms, a measure that had triggered the Gen Z-led protests. The ban, introduced days earlier under Oli's administration, was reversed after a night of emergency cabinet meetings, ministerial resignations and mounting international pressure. Home minister Ramesh Lekhak resigned ""on moral grounds,"" acknowledging that the move had left nearly 20 dead. ""I cannot continue in office when young people are dying in the streets because of a wrong decision,"" he told colleagues.Oli, by contrast, insisted he had never supported the ban. ""I was not in favour of blocking social media,"" he told reporters. Even as the cabinet scrambled to retreat, the clampdown on the streets deepened. Police acknowledged using rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse protesters outside parliament, while the home ministry confirmed that the army had been placed on standby. Curfews were extended across Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur, and flights at Tribhuvan International Airport in the capital Kathmandu were suspended.Symbolic targets were also attacked. Protesters stormed and set fire to the Hilton Hotel in Kathmandu. The luxury property, which opened only last year and is linked to political patrons, was one of the most high-profile casualties of the unrest. Elsewhere, crowds torched the headquarters of governing and opposition parties, vandalised the Kantipur Media Group building, and set sections of Supreme Court compound on fire. For many protesters, such attacks were deliberate acts ""against symbols of privilege and impunity"".Chaos also engulfed Nepal's prisons. In Mahottari district, protesters and inmates breached the walls of Jaleshwar Jail, freeing more than 500 prisoners. In Lalitpur, the Nakhu jail was set ablaze and emptied, with opposition figure Rabi Lamichhane among those released. Police said he was handed over to his family after crowds massed outside demanding his safety. ""The prison could no longer guarantee security,"" one officer said. ""When the fire started, the priority was survival."" Officials admitted they had lost control of multiple facilities, raising fears of a surge in crime and further instability.Helicopters evacuated ministers from their homes in Bhaisepati as smoke rose over govt quarters.","Nepal PM K P Sharma Oli resigns as protests against corruption and censorship spiralled into the most violent unrest the Himalayan nation has seen in years.

Poll What is your opinion on the statement that every worker at Heathrow was Indian? It's an exaggeration. There could be a grain of truth.





A video of a US man went viral after he claimed that ""every worker"" he encountered at London’s Heathrow Airport was Indian, questioning why he did not see any British staff.""I just landed in London. I'm at the airport. And I keep walking around the centre of the airport, where the restaurants are and everything. I don't see any British people working. Not one. Every single one of them is Indian.

However, he questioned how Britain, a country he associated with freedom and democracy, could have no British employees in that setting.""Especially because I'm an immigrant myself. If I walk around the United States, I want to see Americans. I don't want every person that I see and works to be somebody else,"" he added.The clip quickly drew strong reactions online. Some users defended Heathrow’s diverse workforce, while others criticised the traveller’s remarks.One user wrote, ""Americans are having such a poor general knowledge that they are unable to make a difference between Indians and Bangladeshis or Pakistanis.That is why Indians are required to work there.""Another commented, ""Thats how Indians felt in India when the British was everywhere in the country, looting of course.""A third pointed out, ""Stay safe and watch out don’t get robbed.""Heathrow Airport, one of the world’s busiest travel hubs, employs more than 76,000 people, many from diverse ethnic backgrounds.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday acquitted a death convict in rape-murder of a seven-year-old girl in Uttarakhand in 2014 and said the highest degree of circumspection should be exercised by courts before awarding the death penalty.The gruesome rape-murder was termed as the 'Little Nirbhaya' case and had sparked outrage across the state.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta quashed the trial court and Uttarakhand HC's order to convict him and award the extreme punishment. It also acquitted another accused who was punished with a seven-year jail term.SC said there were many loopholes in the probe and the prosecution failed to prove the charges against the accused in the case, which was solely based on circumstantial evidence.""We are of the opinion the prosecution has failed to establish the complete and unbroken chain of circumstances necessary to bring home the guilt of the accused-appellants,"" it said.Appealing to courts to be cautious while awarding death penalty, Justice Mehta, who penned the judgment, said, ""The irreversible nature of capital punishment demands it be imposed only in 'rarest of rare' cases...

Asked about Malik allegedly using abusive language against public functionaries, Singh said it’s officials who often use abusive language toward the public.Malik, who also heads AAP’s J&K unit, was detained on Monday — a day after he accused Doda deputy commissioner Harvinder Singh of misusing his authority — on charges of disturbing public order, and was subsequently lodged in Kathua district jail. He is the first sitting legislator in J&K to be detained under PSA, which allows a person to be kept in custody without charges or trial for up to two years.CM Omar Abdullah, who has strongly condemned Malik’s detention under what he termed “discredited law”, met the legislator’s father Shams-ud-Din Malik on Tuesday evening.Shams-ud-Din, who had travelled from Doda, said he asked the chief minister to secure his son’s release, and was told by Omar that “the entire J&K is with your son”.NC president Farooq Abdullah and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, too, spoke out on Wednesday, warning that attempts to crush people’s voices could lead to mass eruptions. Farooq said LG Manoj Sinha would be solely responsible if law and order situation worsened in the Chenab Valley of Jammu, which is witnessing massive protests against the action against Malik. Security and law and order in J&K are under the LG’s charge.Mehbooba accused the administration of detaining Malik to divert attention from the controversy over desecration of the national emblem at Hazratbal shrine. Referring to the mass uprisings in India’s neighbouring countries, she warned against stifling dissent and said: “We have seen in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and now in Nepal what happens when govts suppress voices. If you silence people, situations can spiral out of hand. ”The situation in Doda district, meanwhile, remained tense, but under control. The administration had imposed prohibitory orders after clashes between protesters and security personnel on Tuesday, and internet services were also snapped in the district. On Wednesday morning, additional forces were deployed to maintain law and order.",Mehraj Malik is the first sitting legislator in J&K to be detained under the Public Safety Act.

Witness accounts from the scene



Chaos on campus



Conflicting reports of an arrest



Political leaders condemn violence



Utah Valley University locked down







Charlie Kirk, a 31-year-old conservative political activist and a close ally of US President Donald Trump, was shot dead while speaking at Utah Valley University on Thursday.Kirk was addressing students under a tent decorated with slogans reading “The American Comeback” and “Prove Me Wrong” when a single gunshot was fired, striking him in the neck.Disturbing video footage from the scene shows him clutching his wound as students screamed and fled the area.Trump confirmed Kirk’s death shortly after the incident and announced that American flags would be flown at half-mast until Sunday as a mark of respect.Authorities have not yet released details on the shooter or the motive behind the attack.FBI Director Kash Patel said that the suspect, who was detained, has been released after interrogation.He had announced the arrest of a person from the scene, praising law enforcement’s quick action. “The subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody,” Patel had written on X.Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said officials believe only one “person involved” in the shooting death of Charlie Kirk on a Utah college campus. “No information suggests a second person,” he stated Wednesday.However, investigators are still seeking anyone with more details. A person of interest is currently in custody and being interviewed, according to the governor.President Trump, who counted Kirk as a key political ally, paid tribute to him both on Truth Social and in an interview with the New York Post.“No one understood or had the heart of the youth in the United States better than Charlie,” Trump wrote online. “He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me.”Trump ordered American flags flown at half-mast until Sunday evening after the assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk. On Truth Social, @Trump shared that the ""Legendary"" debater had been killed, expressing condolences to his wife Erika and young family. He has been closely monitoring the situation as it develops and acknowledged Kirk's impactful legacy.Trump described Kirk as “a very, very good friend” and “a tremendous person,” urging supporters: “We must all pray for Charlie Kirk.”Former Utah congressman Jason Chaffetz, who was present at the event, said Kirk had just taken a question from the audience when the shot rang out.“As soon as I saw Charlie go back, you realise that it was a shot,” Chaffetz told Fox News. “It wasn’t as if there was a whole bunch of gunfire. It was one shot.”He added that security at the event appeared light, with only a small police presence.Videos posted to social media show panic erupting as the shot was fired. Students screamed, ducked for cover, and rushed across a nearby fountain to escape the courtyard.Some in the crowd attempted to rush to Kirk’s aid as security hustled him away. A woman in a red “MAGA” hat was seen in tears, while others were filmed praying near the scene.Images circulating online showed an older white man being led away by police, with one officer reportedly heard saying, “He said he shot him, but I don’t know.”However, law enforcement later clarified that this individual was not the suspect. Confusion remains over whether the gunman fled the campus or is still in hiding.Politicians from across the spectrum denounced the shooting. Vice President JD Vance wrote: “Dear God, protect Charlie in his darkest hour.” Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said disputes should be resolved “through debate, not violence.”Democratic leaders also expressed support. California Governor Gavin Newsom called the attack “disgusting, vile, and reprehensible,” while former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: “Political violence has absolutely no place in our nation.”UVU, Utah’s largest public university with nearly 47,000 students, was closed after the attack. Administrators confirmed the campus would remain under tight security while the search for the shooter continued.The event had already been controversial: a petition calling on the university to bar Kirk from speaking attracted nearly 1,000 signatures. Officials defended the appearance as an exercise in free speech and debate.","Charlie Kirk, a 31-year-old conservative political activist and a close ally of US President Donald Trump, was shot dead while speaking at Utah Valley University on Thursday.

The university issued a statement last week citing First Amendment rights and affirming its “commitment to free speech, intellectual inquiry, and constructive dialogue. ”The Republican and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill condemned political violence Wednesday and called for prayers following reports that conservative activist Charlie Kirk had been shot. “There is no place in our country for political violence. Period, full stop. Please join me in praying for Charlie Kirk,” Senate Republican Leader John Thune said.

'Raised in Indian home with traditional values'







Dr Suman Khulbe, an Indian-origin physician in Canada, lost her registration to practice medicine in her province after she admitted that she engaged in sexual abuse of one male patient and conducted herself unprofessionally with two others whom she professed her love. A panel was set up to look into Dr Khulbe's conduct and they concluded that Dr Khulbe did not see her patients as patients.""She saw them as her friends, her social life, her athletic life and her business partners,” the panel noted adding that the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario has a zero tolerance policy to sexual contact between a doctor and a patient even when the contact would be otherwise considered consensual.Khulbe “had a sexual relationship with one patient and deep personal relationships with others. She had business relationships with two of these patients,” said the decision.According to the National Post, Khulbe will now appeal against the outcome. “Many facts of my case were omitted and not brought out during the public hearing. Attending this contested hearing came at considerable financial and personal sacrifice to both me and my parents in order for my voice to be heard,"" Khulbe issued a statement to NP.The tribunal said Dr Khulbe hosted social gatherings with her patients at her clinic where alcohol was consumed and procaine was administered.

Nepal unrest: Gen Z-army talks stall over interim leadership,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/nepal-unrest-gen-z-army-talks-stall-over-interim-leadership/articleshow/123818828.cms,"'WON'T TOLERATE': Nepal Army Chief's 'Final' Warning To Gen-Z Protesters After Massive Violence





Nepal's youth-led Gen Z movement on Wednesday suspended its protests after two days of violence that left 30 people dead, 1,033 injured, and forced PM K P Sharma Oli to resign.About 15 Gen Z representatives met army officials at Bhadrakali base in the morning. Delegates proposed names for a transitional civilian leadership, including former chief justice Sushila Karki, Kathmandu mayor Balendra Shah, ex-speaker Onsari Gharti Magar, lawyer Om Prakash Aryal, Dr Govinda KC, Brig Gen Prem Shahi, and former chief election commissioner Neel Kantha Upreti.Talks hit a hurdle after delegate Raksha Bam walked out, saying the army had suggested including businessman Durga Prasai and Rastriya Swatantra Party in the dialogue. Prasai has supported restoring the Hindu monarchy and has led rallies calling for the dissolution of federal democratic structures.RSP, a centrist party formed in 2022, has been accused by some youth groups of co-opting anti-corruption slogans while defending institutional status quo.Delegate Bam said this undermined the integrity of the movement. ""Since the army chief himself labelled them as stakeholders, we believe this undermines the sacrifices made during the Gen Z movement...therefore, we have rejected the proposal and walked out."" Organisers of the protest on Wednesday initially issued a call for a nationwide clean-up, urging volunteers to ""clean the streets, don't destroy them"". However, they withdrew that appeal after the army advised against any gatherings under the emergency curfew. Army units continued to maintain checkpoints, broadcast curfew alerts through loudspeakers, and warned citizens of legal action for arson or looting. ""We are mainly in the process of controlling elements who are taking advantage of the situation to loot, set fires and cause various incidents,"" said army spokesperson Rajaram Basnet.Tuesday's protests saw Singha Durbar and Supreme Court torched, and brought the army onto the streets under curfew. The agitation had also shut down Tribhuvan International Airport, which resumed operations late Wednesday.Protests began after the govt imposed a sweeping social media ban, blocking 26 popular platforms in what it said was a move to counter misinformation. The action triggered immediate outrage among urban youth, who viewed it as censorship amid worsening economic frustration and entrenched political nepotism. Demonstrators poured into the streets across multiple cities, waving pirate flags from anime fandoms and targeting official buildings. The ban was quietly lifted late Tuesday but the mobilisation had already spiralled beyond digital grievances. Officials also confirmed that former Nepal PM Jhalanath Khanal's wife Rajyalaxmi Chitrakar, who was inside her home when it was set ablaze, is under care at Kirtipur Burn Hospital and in stable condition. Early reports of her death were circulated on social media but not confirmed by authorities and have since been corrected.The president's office, meanwhile, issued a brief statement urging ""peaceful dialogue and national healing"". No political party has yet endorsed the protesters' demand for parliament's dissolution, but backchannel talks were reportedly under way between former chief justices and Gen Z intermediaries. A senior army officer said the institution would support a constitutional process but would not ""broker chaos"".Despite the curfew, small groups of young people continued symbolic gestures. ""This corruption thing has been in Nepal since a very, very long time, and I think it is high time that the nation needs to change,"" said 14-year-old Ksang Lama, who did not attend the protests. Parash Pratap Hamal, 24, said Nepal needed ""independent political figures"", naming Balen Shah as a possible national leader. In eastern Nepal, 36-year-old Rakesh Niraula said, ""People are hopeful now. .. this was a lesson for leaders to improve themselves.""","Nepal's youth-led Gen Z movement on Wednesday suspended its protests.

Tensions flare in Europe: Nato sounds alarm as Russian drones shot over Poland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/tensions-flare-in-europe-nato-sounds-alarm-as-russian-drones-shot-over-poland-10-key-points/articleshow/123806026.cms,"In first For NATO, Poland Downs Russian Drones Amid Big Attack On Ukraine | Watch

Poll Do you believe NATO's response to Poland's drone incursions was adequate? Yes, they acted promptly. No, they should have done more.

What happened - Explained in 10 points



Nato's Article 4 formally invoked. What is it?



Where were the drones shot down?



Russia escalates air campaign in Ukraine



EU reacts with alarm



'Nato committed to defending every km of allied territory'



How the Polish reacted



Not the first airspace violation



Ukraine warns of wider danger



Domestic political backdrop in Poland



Putin emboldened amid global manoeuvres







Tensions in Ukraine spilled over into Poland as several Russian drones violated its airspace in what officials described as an “act of aggression”. In response, Poland invoked Nato’s Article 4 with Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirming that Polish forces, with Nato support, shot down several drones overnight, marking the first time a member of the alliance has used weapons against Russian objects in its territory.The incident came during Russia’s largest aerial assault on Ukraine since the war began, with hundreds of drones and missiles targeting cities, including Kyiv and Lviv. Several drones strayed into Poland, prompting Warsaw to close airspace and scramble aircraft alongside Nato allies, including the Netherlands and Germany.Prime Minister Tusk told parliament that Poland is now nearer to open conflict than at any time since World War Two. ""I have no reason to claim we're on the brink of war, but a line has been crossed... This situation brings us the closest... since World War Two.""The Kremlin dismissed the accusations and called out EU, Nato's ""usual practice"" of blaming Russia ""without backing it up""“We wouldn’t like to comment on this,” said spokesman Dmitry Peskov, adding it was a matter for the Russian defence ministry. Asked about accusations, he said: “The leadership of the EU and Nato accuse Russia of provocations...usually without backing this up.”For the first time since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Poland has triggered Nato's Article 4, demanding allied consultations on its security. Article 4 allows any member to bring concerns about threats to its territorial integrity, political independence or security before the North Atlantic Council.Article 4 of Nato's founding treaty allows any member state to request consultations when it perceives a threat to its territorial integrity or security.Since 1949, Article 4 has only been invoked a handful of times, including by Poland in 2014 after Russia’s annexation of Crimea, and by Turkey on multiple occasions in response to threats from Syria. This latest invocation underscores the seriousness with which Warsaw views the drone incursions. While Article 4 does not obligate allies to take military action, it often results in joint measures or deployments.Polish defence minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz confirmed that more than 10 objects had crossed into Polish airspace during Russia’s overnight barrage against Ukraine. He said several drones that posed direct threats were intercepted and destroyed with the assistance of NATO forces.Poland's interior ministry reported that the overnight airspace violation damaged a house and a car. ""We have found seven drones and projectile debris... of unknown origin,"" said spokeswoman Karolina Galecka. So far, seven drones and unidentified projectile fragments have been found, alongside damage to property, according to authorities.The Royal Netherlands Air Force deployed F-35 fighter jets, while German Patriot batteries were placed on alert. Italy also contributed early warning aircraft and refuelling support. Local officials reported damage in villages such as Wyryki in the Lublin region, where one house was struck, though no casualties occurred.Chopin Airport in Warsaw suspended flights for several hours due to military activity. The Polish armed forces urged residents not to approach debris from downed drones, warning of hazardous materials. While Poland has faced occasional airspace intrusions in the past, officials described this incident as “unprecedented” in scale and danger, underlining the risks posed by Russia’s escalating air campaign.Ukraine’s air force reported that Russia launched 415 drones and over 40 missiles overnight, striking cities in the centre and west of the country. In Lviv, close to the Polish border, residential areas and infrastructure were damaged, while in Khmelnytskyi, a sewing factory and petrol station were destroyed, injuring three. Vinnytsia, Zhytomyr and Cherkasy regions also reported deaths and significant damage to homes and industry.President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia was deliberately pushing the war closer to Nato territory and warned that partners must respond decisively. Ukrainian officials described the scale of the assault as one of the largest since February 2022, with civilian casualties mounting. Russia’s defence ministry claimed it had intercepted 122 Ukrainian drones over Crimea and Russian regions, portraying its actions as defensive.EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the drone violations in Poland marked the “most serious European airspace violation since the war began”. She stressed that evidence suggested the incursion was intentional. Lithuania’s President Gitanas Nauseda accused Moscow of “deliberately expanding its aggression” against Europe, while Estonia’s foreign minister Margus Tsahkna said Russia posed a “threat not only to Ukraine but to all of Nato”.Sweden’s Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson echoed those concerns, calling the breach “unacceptable”. The reaction reflected growing unease among Europe’s eastern states, who have long warned that Russia could test the alliance’s defences. Officials in Brussels said the latest events had further strengthened the case for reinforcing NATO’s eastern flank.NATO officials confirmed that allied forces actively supported Poland in intercepting hostile objects overnight. Colonel Martin O’Donnell of Supreme Allied Powers Europe said it was the first time NATO aircraft had engaged potential threats inside a member’s airspace during the war.Dutch F-35s scrambled to assist Polish jets, while German, Italian and multinational NATO aircraft were deployed for support and monitoring. The alliance stressed that its defences had worked as intended and demonstrated unity in protecting Polish sovereignty. NATO spokesperson Allison Hart confirmed that ambassadors would discuss the incident at a pre-planned meeting, now expanded to address the emergency. “NATO remains committed to defending every kilometre of allied territory,” she said.The drone strikes caused disruption across parts of eastern Poland. In Wyryki, villagers reported an explosion that damaged a home, though occupants escaped unhurt. Authorities closed airspace over Warsaw and surrounding areas, grounding flights at Chopin Airport before reopening several hours later. Defence forces urged civilians to report debris and activated territorial units to assist in searches. Officials stressed the dangers of touching fragments, warning they could contain explosives or toxic materials. PPrime Minister Tusk called an extraordinary cabinet meeting to assess security, while President Nawrocki said protecting citizens remained the top priority. The incidents underscored how Poland, already hosting more than a million Ukrainian refugees, is directly exposed to the consequences of the war.This is not the first time Russia-linked objects have entered Poland, but officials said the scale set it apart. In August 2023, a Russian drone exploded in a Polish cornfield, an incident Warsaw labelled a “provocation”. Earlier in March, a Russian missile briefly crossed Poland en route to Ukraine, forcing jets to scramble.In November 2022, a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile tragically killed two civilians after straying across the border. These episodes have fuelled debates about Nato’s rules of engagement and the threshold for invoking Article 5. Until now, Poland had not engaged intruding objects directly. Wednesday’s shoot-down therefore represents a significant change in posture, with Warsaw signalling it will act forcefully against incursions.Ukrainian officials said Russia’s drone incursions into Poland showed President Vladimir Putin was “testing the West”. Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga argued that Moscow was emboldened by weak responses to past provocations.“The longer he faces no strength in response, the more aggressive he gets,” Sybiga warned. Zelensky echoed the sentiment, calling the overnight events a dangerous precedent. Kyiv has urged Nato to adopt stronger deterrence measures, arguing that Russia is deliberately probing weaknesses. Ukraine’s military reported that at least eight drones launched at its territory diverted toward Poland. Officials said this demonstrated Moscow’s willingness to broaden the scope of attacks, even at the risk of triggering Nato confrontation.The escalation comes at a sensitive moment in Polish politics. Newly elected President Karol Nawrocki has taken a hard line on Russia, warning only days earlier that Putin could invade other countries beyond Ukraine.Prime Minister Tusk, addressing parliament, emphasised that Warsaw was prepared to defend its territory and called the drone strikes a “large-scale provocation”. The extraordinary cabinet meeting underscored the gravity with which the government views the situation. Poland, a staunch supporter of Ukraine since the invasion, has provided aid, hosted refugees and served as a vital logistics hub for Western assistance.The timing of the drone incursions raised questions about Russia’s broader strategy. The escalation followed Vladimir Putin’s visit to China, where he met Xi Jinping and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un in a display of authoritarian unity.In Poland, officials linked the drone incidents to joint Russian-Belarusian military exercises, Zapad 25, set to begin near their border. Tusk announced that Poland would close its frontier with Belarus as a precaution. European leaders interpreted the timing as deliberate, a show of strength aimed at unnerving Nato.","Nato's Article 4 formally invoked.

Hyundai-LG site raid: South Korea warns US action may affect future investment; President Lee terms it ‘bewildering’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/hyundai-lg-site-raid-south-korea-warns-us-action-may-affect-future-investment-president-lee-terms-it-bewildering/articleshow/123820855.cms,"File photo: South Korean President Lee Jae Myung (Picture credit: AP)





South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Thursday warned that a large-scale US immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG battery plant under construction could have serious repercussions on future South Korean investments in America.The operation in Georgia, which saw hundreds of South Korean workers chained and handcuffed, was “bewildering” and “could have a significant impact on future investment decisions, particularly when evaluating the feasibility of direct operations in the US,” Lee said, according to news agency AFP.He also mentioned that South Korean businesses will face difficulties in keeping direct investments in the United States if the visa system for Korean workers does not see improvements.President Lee Jae Myung addressed the situation during a press conference, discussing the detention of South Korean workers following the immigration raid on Hyundai’s extensive auto plant in Georgia.US officials described the raid on September 4 as the largest single-site enforcement action in American history. Nearly 475 workers, more than 300 of them South Korean nationals, were detained during the Homeland Security-led operation at Hyundai’s sprawling complex west of Savannah.Video released by US authorities showed some workers shackled at their hands, ankles and waists, a move that shocked South Koreans and fuelled a sense of betrayal.Seoul dispatched a charter plane to Atlanta this week to bring back the detained workers.However, its return was delayed before the South Korean foreign ministry confirmed that the flight would depart on Thursday.Confirming their return, President Lee said, ""They are scheduled to depart the detention facility at 3 pm Seoul time (0600 GMT) today.""Negotiations with Washington have led to the release of workers under “voluntary” departures rather than deportations, which would have barred them from re-entering the US for up to a decade, according to news agency AP.The raid has come at a sensitive time. Only 11 days before, Lee had met US President Donald Trump in Washington, pledging an additional $150 billion investment in the US, following a July promise of $350 billion linked to tariff negotiations.During his Washington visit on Wednesday, South Korean foreign minister Cho Hyun raised the matter with US secretary of state Marco Rubio, saying that the images of detained workers had caused “big pains and shocks” in South Korea. He called for assurances that the workers would be able to leave without handcuffs and without future re-entry problems, as per AP.Trump defended the raid, saying the workers “were here illegally” and that the US must train its own citizens for specialised roles in industries such as batteries and semiconductors.","South Korean President Lee Jae Myung spoke at a press conference on Thursday.

BENGALURU: The hostel warden of a private residential international academy school near Electronics City was arrested on charges of abetting the sexual assault of a class 10 student by his seniors and classmates.Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act were invoked against the warden 48, who was sent to judicial custody in Bengaluru Central Prison.The principal of the institution, arraigned as suspect number eight in the complaint registered with Bannerghatta police, will be summoned for questioning.The remaining six suspects named in the FIR — a mix of class 12, 11 and 10 students at the institution — have been directed to remain in their hostel rooms and not go out without police permission.""Six students have been booked under JJ Act and Pocso Act, 2012 — three from class 12, one from class 11 and two from class 10.

Once the suspects' parents arrive, we will continue the investigation,"" said a police officer.The father of the 15-year-old student, who had joined the educational institution this year, filed a police complaint about his son's horrifying experience after he got to know about it during a phone conversation.According to the complainant, who belongs to North Karnataka, neither the warden nor the principal of the institution acted against the accused juveniles even after his son complained against them several times. ""Instead, they instigated the accused students to attack my son,"" the father stated in the complaint.He told police the accused students stripped the boy on Sept 3 night and forced him to dance naked. They hit the boy with different objects, including steel hangers, when he stopped dancing.The same group again went to the boy's room the next night — Sept 4 — stripped him and forced him to dance naked. This time, when the boy stopped dancing, he was sexually assaulted by the group. The mistreatment continued on the nights of Sept 5-6. They poured hot and cold water on him before leaving, the complaint said.The complaint claimed the hostel warden was angry with the boy for helping some fellow students complain to the principal about his misbehaviour.","The hostel warden of a private residential international academy school was arrested on charges of abetting the sexual assault of a class 10 student.

AGRA: As the Yamuna continued to flow above the danger mark in Agra on Wed, water seeped into nearly a dozen underground cells on the river-facing side of Itmad-ud-Daulah, the mausoleum built by Mughal queen, Nur Jehan for her father, often called the ‘Baby Taj'because of it's striking resemblance to the monument of love.According to the Archaeological Survey of India, about 12 underground chambers of Itmad-ud-daulah had been flooded as the river remained above the danger mark for the fourth consecutive day. The Agra administration said that the Yamuna stood at 152.6 meters at 5 pm on Wednesday -- above the danger mark but still below the ""high flood level"".""The cells on the side of the Yamuna have water inside, around five to six feet deep in multiple cells.

Nepal's protest movement tipped into large-scale economic violence, with mobs torching factories, supermarkets, banks and hotels in coordinated attacks that left some of the most prominent industrialists reeling.On Tuesday, protesters set fire to the Chaudhary Group's electronics factory in Satungal, vandalised the offices and residence of billionaire Binod Chaudhary, and looted flagship branches of Bhatbhateni Superstore - Nepal's version of the ubiquitous 7-Eleven stores. ""Three or four vehicles have been burnt. A house has been set on fire, all the belongings inside looted,"" an official of Chaudhary Group said.Industrialist Shekhar Golchha, outgoing president of Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, saw his home vandalised and torched, but confirmed his family was safe.

MUMBAI: The Mumbai crime branch on Wednesday morning arrested a junior sailor Rakesh Dubbala (22) and his elder brother Umesh (25) from Asifabad in Telangana for the theft of a rifle and ammunition from Navy Nagar in Colaba and are probing a Naxal link in the case.Police suspect the duo planned to sell the weapon, possibly to Naxalites in Telangana.Police said Rakesh, who had been previously posted in Navy Nagar for 1.5 years before being transferred to the Navy's Kochi base in Feb this year, entered the area using his ID card, posed as 'reliever' of another junior sailor and fled after allegedly collecting the rifle and ammunition from the sailor posted on duty.Rakesh collected the INSAS rifle and 40 bullets and later threw the gun across the compound wall, where it was collected by Umesh.

NAGPUR/SILIGURI: Maharashtra men stranded in Nepal hide in hotels. At Bengal's Panitanki border, Indians stagger home while Nepalese wait in despair.Ajay Gaur from Amravati said over phone on Wednesday he fled burnt vehicles between Manari and Hetauda. ""I have been working in Nepal seven years. I was supposed to leave for Varanasi today. I missed my train after violent protests. I then rode a bike. I feared for my life. Authorities told us to stay put. It is a nightmarish experience everywhere,"" he said.At Panitanki, contrasting scenes were seen. Indians crossed into Bengal with relief. Nepalese people stood stuck at the Mechi river bridge, anxious to enter India. Security was tightened at Panitanki-Kakarbhitta and Pashupatinagar, 29km from Darjeeling.Senior Bengal police and SSB officers monitored. ""Our side is peaceful. Nepal is not. We are monitoring,"" Bengal police ADG Ajay Nand said.Around 31 Indians were reported stuck in Kakarbhitta border town. Only a few crossed back Wednesday. Nepal residents were barred. Immigration stayed suspended. Over 200 trucks, some with rice and other food items, lined up helpless.Returnees spoke of horror. Bipin Kumar Choudhary from Bihar's Samastipur entered Biratnagar on Sept 8.""An eight-year-old boy was shot in the chest. With govt toppled, anything could happen. Protests were low-key today, so we returned. But Nepal is highly volatile,"" he said.Akshay Kanherkar of Amravati, who worked six years in Butwal, said his friends from UP and Vidarbha (Maharashtra) are stuck. Seema Devi from Bengal fled Biratnagar without completing an eye check-up. Proximity, affordability, shorter waiting times, and expertise in cataract and corneal surgeries make Nepal a convenient choice for many Indians. ""My doctor called me for a follow-up. Protests erupted. I saw mobs burning tyres. Bloodied bodies lay on the streets,"" Devi said.On the other side, Nepal residents begged to enter India. Saru Rai of Kakarbhitta pleaded for her sick daughter. ""She is in a Siliguri hospital with appendicitis. We waited over three hours. Families like ours depend on India for essential needs. With govt toppled, no authority helps us,"" she said.","Security tightened at Panitanki-Kakarbhitta and Pashupatinagar, 29km from Darjeeling. Nepal residents were barred.

Nato says it scrambled fighter jets to down drones over Poland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nato-says-it-scrambled-fighter-jets-to-down-drones-over-poland/articleshow/123821144.cms,"



More than a dozen Russian drones entered Poland overnight, prompting Nato to scramble fighter jets to shoot them down in what Western officials described Wednesday as a dangerous escalation of the war in neighbouring Ukraine.It was the first time in the history of Nato that alliance fighters had engaged enemy targets in allied airspace, officials said. It prompted Poland's govt to invoke Article 4 of the Nato treaty, a rarely used mechanism triggered when a member faces threat that enables a discussion within the alliance about it. ""We are dealing with a large-scale provocation,"" PM Donald Tusk of Poland said. ""The situation is serious, and no one doubts that we must prepare for various scenarios. ""Details of the drone incursion remained murky. It was unclear whether Moscow had intentionally sought to expand the conflict. It was also unknown whether the drones were the Shahed-style attack weapons regularly used to terrorise Ukrainian cities or unarmed dummy drones sent to fool Ukrainian air defenses.The crossover into Poland came amid a large-scale drone and missile attack on Ukraine, officials said. According to Ukraine's air force, as many as 415 drones were launched in that attack, and at least eight were detected crossing the border with Poland.Tusk put the number of drones on Polish territory at 19, though he did not say how many were shot down. Russian drones have crossed into Poland before but the apparent scale of the infiltration and the joint Nato response was a startling reminder of the risk that the war in Ukraine could escalate into direct confrontation between Russia and Nato.The Kremlin and its allies delivered mixed messages about the drones. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov accused the ""leadership of the EU and Nato"" of levelling accusations against Russia ""on a daily basis"" without providing evidence, though he did not deny Russian involvement. Russia's defence ministry said it had ""not planned"" to hit any targets in Poland and suggested that Poland was out of range of Russian drones, which is not true. Polish and other Nato officials said they were awaiting the results of a military assessment before making conclusions. ""The wreckage of the downed drones is being analysed, but there is a strong indication that these were not random incidents but planned action,"" said Radoslaw Fogiel, the deputy chair of the foreign affairs committee in the Polish parliament.

Who is Sushila Karki?

Poll Is the involvement of military forces appropriate in response to the protests? Yes, to maintain order. No, it escalates the situation.

Born on June 7, 1952 in Biratnagar, Nepal.

Studied Law at Tribhuvan University (1978) and Political Science at Banaras Hindu University (1975).

Served as Chief Justice of Nepal from July 2016 to June 2017, the first woman to hold the post.

Faced impeachment in 2017 after ruling against political interference in police appointments.

Previously worked as a justice of the Supreme Court, senior advocate, and law professor.

Author of a book on gender equality and long-time member of human rights and women’s judicial organisations.

Recognised with awards including the Sambhav Kanoon Puraskar (2004).





Nepal’s Gen Z protest movement has chosen former Chief Justice Sushila Karki as its interim leader, news agency ANI reported citing sources. In a virtual meeting lasting nearly four hours, young organisers agreed that no youth connected to political parties should assume the role, and settled on Karki as the figure to represent them in upcoming negotiations, local media outfit Khabarhub reported.The decision came as Kathmandu remains under curfew, with soldiers deployed to restore order after government buildings, politicians’ homes and even the parliament were torched by furious demonstrators. The protests, triggered by a controversial social media ban, have spiralled into a wider rejection of corruption, nepotism and entrenched political elites. At least 19 people have been killed and hundreds injured since the unrest began.Karki made history in 2016 when she became Nepal’s first female chief justice. But her tenure was cut short the following year when lawmakers filed an impeachment motion accusing her of “delivering biased verdicts” and interfering in the executive’s jurisdiction. The motion followed her court’s decision to overturn the government’s police chief appointment, ruling that seniority had been unfairly bypassed.Although she was automatically suspended while the investigation proceeded, the impeachment process failed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority before her retirement in June 2017.Earlier, Kathmandu’s young mayor, Balendra Shah, widely known as “Balen” also emerged as a likely figure to lead the interim government. The 35-year-old rapper-turned-politician, studied structural engineering at Visvesvaraya Technological University in India. He rose to prominence through Nepal’s underground hip-hop scene, using his music to speak out against corruption and inequality. In June 2023, he made headlines by banning Indian films in Kathmandu over a line in Adipurush.","Nepal’s Gen Z protest movement has chosen former Chief Justice Sushila Karki as its interim leader, news agency ANI reported citing sources.

Charlie Kirk, MAGA loyalist and conservative commentator, was shot dead on Wednesday while attending an event in Utah.The staunch Trump ally was known for his hard-line remarks on immigration, abortion, gun control and race, sparking heated debates across American campuses.Just days before his death, Kirk had commented on Indian professionals in the US workforce. He claimed that ""no form of legal immigration has so displaced American workers as those from India.""On September 2, he posted on X: “America does not need more visas for people from India. Perhaps no form of legal immigration has so displaced American workers as those from India. Enough already. We’re full. Let’s finally put our own people first.”His comments came in response to Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who argued that any trade deal with India would mean the US having to grant more visas. She said she would rather not “pay them in visas and trade deficits” and added that “Modi should see what terms he can get from Xi instead.”Kirk’s comments came as conservative figures intensified their criticism of the H-1B visa system.The debate over visas and outsourcing has long been used as a political flashpoint. Right-wing activist Laura Loomer suggested that Donald Trump could even consider banning outsourcing to Indian call centres, saying, “You don’t need to press 2 for English anymore. Make Call Centers American Again!”Supporters of immigration, however, argue the opposite. A fact sheet released by the American Immigration Council last year said that immigrant and native-born workers generally complement each other rather than compete for the same jobs.Indian H-1B holders, in particular, contribute by paying taxes, supporting local communities, and strengthening research-driven industries like Silicon Valley and healthcare.Yet Trump-era policies have hardened. Tariffs on Indian goods were doubled to 50 per cent, while thousands of student visas for Indians were revoked, even as Chinese students were admitted in large numbers. Congressman Ro Khanna warned that “we can't allow the ego of Donald Trump to destroy a strategic relationship with India, that is key to ensuring that America leads and not China.”","Conservative commentator Charlie Kirk was shot dead on Wednesday.

A moment of silence in the US house of representatives on Wednesday, held in response to the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, quickly descended into a heated partisan exchange, with Republicans and Democrats blaming each other for the political violence.The disruption unfolded shortly after house speaker Mike Johnson called for lawmakers to stand for a silent prayer in Kirk’s memory.“Please rise for a moment of prayer for Charlie Kirk and his family,” Johnson said, pausing legislative proceedings. Members from both parties and visitors in the gallery observed the silence.But immediately afterward, Republican representative Lauren Boebert requested a spoken prayer for Kirk, stating, “I believe silent prayers get silent results.” That request sparked objections from Democrats, some of whom shouted, “What about the kids in Colorado?” - a reference to a school shooting that had occurred earlier the same day, according to news portal AXIOS.Boebert later claimed she had planned to mention the Colorado shooting as well, but was interrupted.The situation escalated when Republican representative Anna Paulina Luna, a former Turning Point USA staffer and close ally of Kirk, pointed at Democrats and yelled, “You caused this!”Her accusation drew a loud response from across the aisle. Jahana Hayes of Connecticut, a member of the house gun violence prevention task force, responded, “Pass some gun laws!”Speaker Johnson repeatedly called for order as the shouting continued.“We will join for prayer right after this, OK?” he said, but tensions remained high.Lawmakers expressed dismay over the incident. “Political violence is scary for all of us, and … that type of backlash doesn’t help things,” Representative Susie Lee told Axios. She called the confrontation a reminder that “we need to turn the temperature down in this country.”Another Republican representative Dan Meuser called the incident “classless,” adding, “We had a couple on our side that should have kept their mouths shut… there were many on the Democrat side that needed to show their discontent and rudeness.”Democratic lawmakers also raised concerns about procedure, arguing that Boebert’s request for a spoken prayer on the House floor was a departure from protocol. “We don’t even do [that] for fallen members,” said Rep. Joe Morelle (D-N.Y.), ranking member of the house administration committee. “When you violate [procedure] and create exceptions, it then leads to this uneasiness.”On the other side, Luna told Axios that Speaker Johnson should still allow the prayer despite Democratic objections. “The fact that Democrats were not allowing the speaker to do a moment of prayer is really disgusting,” she said. “We should have been allowed to pray for Charlie.”",A moment of silence in the US house of representatives on Wednesday quickly descended into a heated partisan exchange.

He vowed that his administration would find ""each and every"" person who contributed to this atrocity.In a video message addressed to Americans, Trump lambasted the ""radical left,"" suggesting its rhetoric contributed to the death of Kirk.""For years those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals,"" Trump said in the video.""This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now."" he added.Trump, in the video, said that he is filled with grief and anger over the assassination of his ally Kirk at Utah University. He hailed Kirk as an inspiration for millions and prayed for his family.""To my great fellow Americans, I am filled with grief and anger at the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk on a college campus in Utah. Charlie inspired millions and tonight all who knew him and loved him are united in shock and horror.Charlie was a patriot who devoted his life to the cause of open debate and the country that he loved so much, the United States of America,"" he said.""He fought for liberty, democracy, justice and the American people. He's a martyr for truth and freedom and there's never been anyone who was so respected by youth. Charlie was also a man of deep, deep faith and we take comfort in the knowledge that he is now at peace with God in heaven,"" Trump added.Trump also prayed for Kirk's family. ""Our prayers are with his wife, Erica, the two young beloved children and his entire family who he loved more than anything in the world. We ask God to watch over them in this terrible hour of heartache and pain. This is a dark moment for America,"" Trump said.""Charlie Kirk travelled the nation joyfully engaging with everyone interested in good faith debate. His mission was to bring young people into the political process, which he did better than anybody ever, to share his love of country and to spread the simple words of common sense. On campuses nationwide, he championed his ideas with courage, logic, humour and grace,"" the US president added.Trump also attacked the radical left, which suggested that its rhetoric contributed to the death of Kirk.""It's a long past time for all Americans and the media to confront the fact that violence and murder are the tragic consequences of demonising those with whom you disagree day after day, year after year, in the most hateful and despicable way possible. For years those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals. This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today and it must stop right now,"" Trump added.Trump emphasised that his administration will find the person behind the assassination of Kirk. He also vowed a crackdown against other political violence, including an assassination attempt against him in Butler, to the killing of a health executive in New York, which is a threat to America and its people.""My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organisations that fund it and support it, as well as those who go after our judges, law enforcement officials and everyone else who brings order to our country. From the attack on my life in Butler, Pennsylvania last year, which killed a husband and father, to the attacks on ICE agents, to the vicious murder of a health care executive in the streets of New York, to the shooting of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and three others, radical left political violence has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives. Tonight I ask all Americans to commit themselves to the American values for which Charlie Kirk lived and died,"" he said.""The values of free speech, citizenship, the rule of law, and the patriotic devotion and love of God. Charlie was the best of America and the monster who attacked him was attacking our whole country. An assassin tried to silence him with a bullet, but he failed because together we will ensure that his voice, his message, and his legacy will live on for countless generations to come,"" he added.Trump asserted that because of this heinous act, Charlie's voice has become ""bigger and grander than ever before.""","US President Donald Trump hails his ally Charlie Kirk as a ""martyr for truth"" Trump calls his assassination ""heinous"" and ""dark moment"" for America.

Protesters Disrupt Trump’s Dinner With Hitler Chants; Chaos In Washington DC

Poll Do you support the recent crime crackdown in Washington DC? Yes, it's necessary for safety No, it infringes on civil liberties





US president Donald Trump faced protests on Tuesday evening while dining at a restaurant in Washington DC.As Trump entered Joe’s Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab, near the White House, a small group of demonstrators chanted “Free DC” and “Free Palestine,” calling him “the Hitler of our time. ” Other diners booed the protesters.Trump responded with, “We have a safe city, so that’s good. Enjoy yourself. You won’t be mugged going home,” he told the diners.The protesters were later escorted out, according to CNN.Trump was accompanied by secretary of state Marco Rubio, vice president JD Vance and defence secretary Pete Hegseth.Speaking to reporters outside before dinner, Trump said his administration’s recent crime crackdown had made the city safe and hinted at announcing a similar operation in another city soon.“We’ll be announcing another city that we’re going to very shortly, we’re working it out,” he said.The president noted he would not have risked dining in DC months earlier. “This was one of the most unsafe cities in the country. Now it’s as safe as there is in the country, so we’re here with cabinet members having dinner, and everybody should go out,” he said.His remarks came a month after the administration expanded federal control over DC policing, deploying law enforcement and troops in the capital.","Protesters chant 'Free DC' and 'Free Palestine' as Donald Trump dines in Washington DC.

'Make America healthy again’: New RFK Jr report pushes child health policies; key takeaways,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/make-america-healthy-again-new-rfk-jr-report-pushes-child-health-policies-key-takeaways/articleshow/123800206.cms,"Robert F Kennedy Jr (AP photo)

Trump Breaks From RFK Jr; Defends 'Amazing Vaccines' Amid Calls For Kennedy's Resignation

Key takeaways from the latest report:

The commission recommended that US schools serve full-fat milk and promote healthier food options for children.

It called for stricter federal oversight of prescription drug advertisements, especially those targeting children through social media and telehealth.

It suggested setting a government definition for “ultra-processed food” and introducing restrictions on synthetic food dyes.

The commission stopped short of recommending tighter controls on pesticides, instead promising improved review processes to maintain farmer access.





US “Make America healthy again” commission, set up by president Donald Trump, and led by health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, released its second report on Tuesday, warning of rising chronic illness among American children.“A lot of these 128 recommendations are the things that I’ve been dreaming about,” Kennedy said at the briefing, calling it a “historic collaboration” between health workers, teachers and industry.The report centres on four main areas, boosting research, pushing policy reforms such as a new “vaccine framework,” raising public awareness about children’s health issues, and building partnerships with the private sector.Many public health experts said the report offered some useful ideas for improving children’s health, but criticised it for lacking a clear plan of action.“As they say, ‘Where’s the meat on this thing?’” said Dr Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American public health association, as quoted by NBC News. “If one of my graduate students handed me this, I’d send them back to do more work.”","US “Make America healthy again” commission, set up by president Donald Trump, and led by health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, released its second report on Tuesday.

Family’s response and fundraising challenges

Legal implications and future outlook





A 23-year-old British law student from Merseyside has been sentenced to 25 years in Dubai’s Central Prison after being convicted of drug trafficking. Caught with 50 grams of cocaine, Mia O’Brien now faces a future behind bars in one of the region’s most notorious prisons, as her family back home scrambles for support.Mia O’Brien, a law student from Liverpool University and resident of Huyton, Merseyside, was arrested in October after authorities allegedly discovered 50 grams of cocaine in her Dubai apartment. The drugs were found in a single large lump, and local officials charged her with drug dealing — a serious offence under the United Arab Emirates’ strict narcotics laws.O’Brien was arrested alongside a female friend and the friend’s boyfriend. All three faced similar drug charges. Despite pleading not guilty, Mia was convicted during a swift one-day court hearing on July 25. The judge sentenced her to 25 years in prison — often classified under UAE law as a life sentence — and imposed a fine of £100,000.According to estimates, the street value of the seized cocaine would be around £2,500 in the UK.Following her sentencing, Mia was transferred to Dubai Central Prison, a facility widely known for its harsh and often brutal conditions.Reports from previous years describe a system plagued by overcrowding, abuse, and systemic violence.According to her mother, Danielle McKenna, Mia is currently held in a cramped cell with six other inmates, most of whom are Nigerian nationals. She described her daughter’s emotional state as “absolutely devastated,” noting that Mia had always dreamed of becoming a lawyer or solicitor before this incident drastically altered her life path.Communication with Mia has been limited and closely monitored. “I speak to her but she can't say too much on the phone,” her mother said. Conditions inside the prison are reported to be extreme — with torture used to extract confessions and frequent accounts of rape and violence, both from inmates and prison staff.In an effort to bring her daughter home or improve her legal situation, Danielle McKenna launched a fundraising campaign on GoFundMe. However, the platform removed the page on Friday, citing violations of its Terms of Service.A GoFundMe spokesperson explained the takedown, referencing Term 9 of their Prohibited Conduct policy: “It was removed because it violates Term 9 of the Prohibited Conduct section in our Terms of Service. Term 9 prohibits raising funds on GoFundMe for the legal defense of certain alleged crimes.”In response, Danielle turned to social media to continue seeking help. She shared her personal bank details on Facebook, urging people to send donations directly. Explaining her move, she wrote: “I am going to set up my own, as they [GoFundMe] are nitpicking at everything.” She also noted that direct contributions would avoid platform fees: “This way I get to keep everything.”Despite the setback, she thanked those who had shown support: “I would just like to thank everyone.”On the original GoFundMe page, she had described Mia as a bright and well-meaning young woman who had fallen in with the wrong crowd:“Mia is only 23 years old and has never done a bad thing in her life. This is a young girl, who went to university to do law, and unfortunately got mixed up in the wrong so-called friends and made a very stupid mistake and is now paying the price.”Under UAE law, drug trafficking carries extremely severe penalties, including life imprisonment or, in rare cases, the death penalty. While Mia’s 25-year sentence is considered a “life sentence” under Emirati legal definitions, her family still hopes to reduce or overturn the decision through appeal or intervention.As of now, no official UK government statement has been made regarding diplomatic efforts in Mia’s case. However, past instances have seen British consular support offered in cases involving citizens jailed abroad.The case serves as a stark reminder of the strict anti-drug laws in the Middle East and the life-altering consequences that can arise from even a single misstep.","Mia O’Brien, a 23-year-old law student from Merseyside, was arrested in October.

For that, I have also called an all-party meeting at 6 pm today.

Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and close ally of American President Donald Trump, was shot and killed on Wednesday during a campus event in Utah, US. The state’s governor described it as a political assassination carried out from a rooftop.Kirk, 31, was on the university campus in Orem for the first stop of his ""American Comeback Tour,"" where he planned to speak with students about conservative politics and take questions.He was speaking under a tent when he was hit in the neck by a bullet. He was taken to a hospital and later pronounced dead.A person who had been detained was released after questioning, FBI director Kash Patel wrote on social media. Officials said the investigation is ongoing.The attack was condemned across political lines. Trump ordered that American flags be lowered to half-staff until Sunday evening in Kirk’s honor.Kirk’s death was first announced by Trump in a Truth Social post. Trump wrote: ""The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead. No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us. Melania and my Sympathies go out to his beautiful wife Erika, and family. Charlie, we love you!""Video from the event showed him seated under a white tent with a microphone in hand as he spoke to the audience.One attendee asked, ""Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?"" Kirk replied, ""Too many."" The same attendee then asked, ""Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?” Kirk responded, ""Counting or not counting gang violence?"" Seconds later, a gunshot was fired.A man detained on Wednesday afternoon was released after being interviewed. FBI director Patel said the investigation continues. Utah governor Spencer Cox said at a news conference that no evidence suggested a second person was involved.The man first detained at the scene, George Zinn, was ruled out as a suspect but charged with obstructing justice.Kirk had been speaking for about 20 minutes when he was shot shortly after noon local time, the university said. He was seated under a tent with the slogan ""The American Comeback.""Videos showed him falling from his chair as blood flowed from his neck.A university spokesperson, quoted by New York Times, said the shot came from the Losee Center, a building more than 100 yards away.Before the shooting, Kirk had been answering a question about transgender mass shooting suspects, attendee Andrew Piskadlo told The New York Times.Cellphone videos showed people running and taking cover.

The group built chapters at colleges and high schools across the country and attracted early support from Republican donors, including members of the Trump family.He gained a following among young Republicans and was active on social media, podcasts, and books. Some of his posts drew criticism, including comments about Jewish, gay and Black people.Kirk was married to Erika Kirk, a former Miss Arizona who hosts a podcast and runs a faith-themed clothing line. They lived in Scottsdale, Arizona, and had two children.Kirk visited the White House more than 100 times during Trump’s first term, a report by The New York Times said. After Trump won re-election, Kirk was part of a small group that reviewed potential White House appointees for loyalty.He was close to Donald Trump Jr. and attended a private party at Trump’s golf club in Virginia two days before the inauguration.Alongside Turning Point USA, he launched Turning Point Faith, which the organization described as an effort to ""eliminate wokeism from the American pulpit."" He urged students to challenge professors he said promoted gender ideology.Utah Valley University (UVU), where Charlie Kirk was shot and killed, is in Orem and is the state’s largest public university, according to its website.The school was established in 1941 as a war production training vocational school. As of fall 2023, it had more than 46,800 enrolled students, along with about 16,700 high school students taking concurrent courses.Following the shooting, UVU announced it will remain closed until next week.University president Astrid Tuminez said the community was “shocked and saddened” by Kirk’s death.

Trump's not thinking about the effects of his actions: Ex-US NSA John Bolton,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-not-thinking-about-the-effects-of-his-actions-ex-us-nsa-john-bolton/articleshow/123819280.cms,"



US President Donald Trump's former National Security Advisor John Bolton on Wednesday said the latest conciliatory messages between Trump and PM Modi were a ""positive sign"" and hoped that it would end the confrontation between the two countries.In an exclusive interview to TOI, Bolton, who has been a vocal critic of Trump, said, ""Trump sees state-to-state relations as being almost totally embodied in the personal relationship between the leaders of the country concerned. So, it's a positive sign that he said nice things about PM Modi, and I hope that's a precursor to resolving some of the issues on the tariffs."" But adding a note of caution he said, ""The trouble is the 25% tariff on the purchase of Russian oil. That's still something that I think Trump is going to insist on."" He added that the additional 25% tariffs were ""proof of incoherence"" in strategy within the Trump administration.Bolton's remarks come on a day when the tone appears to have shifted in US-India ties. Earlier on Wednesday, Trump's post on Truth Social announced that he saw no difficulty in negotiating a deal with India and described PM Modi as a ""very good friend"".Modi reciprocated by terming India and the US as ""close friends"" and ""natural partners"".On the issue of an additional penalty of 25% levied for purchasing Russian oil, the former NSA said that ironically sanctions had not been applied on China, which is the largest buyer. ""I think it's a case of the Trump's administration not thinking about what the effects of certain actions will be; they think in terms of Ukraine and don't consider other larger questions. And that's why this confrontation has been so damaging to long-standing efforts to try and draw India closer to the US,"" he said.Speaking on the structuring of the oil levy, he said it was created with two objectives: to reduce Russia's revenues to impair its ability to conduct the war in Ukraine and keep Russian oil under a price cap. The Biden administration and European govts were worried about increases in the price of gasoline in their countries. Referring to this policy, he said, ""This is doomed to failure because it's self-contradictory. My understanding is that much of the oil that India bought from Russia was sold to the Europeans. So, it's a little bit hard for the Europeans to complain about this. To me, it's further proof of incoherence within the Trump administration.""On being asked what the thinking behind the constant shift in US strategy, he said, ""I don't think they are thinking. That's the problem. Part of strategic thinking is to work out what your priorities are. The war in Ukraine is, and has been, a high priority. But the US relationship with India is a high priority too, and the two trains have collided here.
