Judge removal involves several steps. Here’s how it proceeds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judge-removal-involves-several-steps-heres-how-it-proceeds/articleshow/121477504.cms,"Judge removal involves several steps. Here’s how it proceeds

Once a judicial inquiry committee concludes in its report about wrongdoing by a constitutional court judge, the CJI, on being satisfied with the committee’s finding, offers an opportunity to the judge concerned to resign.If the judge refuses, then the CJI forwards the inquiry report to the President, who is the appointing authority, and the PM. The PM and the Union Cabinet, after discussing the report, may ask the law ministry/parliamentary affairs ministry to initiate a motion for removal.A notice for motion of removal against the judge can be moved in Rajya Sabha if 50 or more MPs sign the motion, and in Lok Sabha if 100 or more MPs agree to put their signatures to it.Once the motion is placed before the LS Speaker or RS chairman, in either case, he carries out a preliminary review of the report as well as the accompanying motion and has the power to ‘admit or refuse to admit’ the notice of motion for removal (Section 3 of Judges Inquiry Act, 1968).In the event of admitting the notice of motion for removal, the head of the House concerned will keep the motion pending and constitute a three-member committee for “the purpose of making an investigation into the grounds on which the removal of a judge is prayed for”.The committee will comprise either the CJI or a judge of the SC, an HC chief justice and a distinguished jurist. The committee will then frame charges against the judge concerned. “Such charges, together with a statement of the grounds on which each such charge is based, shall be communicated to the judge and he shall be given a reasonable opportunity of presenting a written statement of defence within such time as may be specified in this behalf by the committee,” the Act provides.Section 4 of the Act provides, “The committee shall have power to regulate its own procedure in making the investigation and shall give a reasonable opportunity to the judge of cross-examining witnesses, adducing evidence and of being heard in his defence.” The committee, after conclusion of the investigation, will present a report to the head of the House concerned where the motion for removal is pending.If the report finds the judge ‘not guilty’, then no further steps will be taken, and the motion will be treated as infructuous. If the report finds the judge guilty, then the head of the House will lay the report before the House as soon as possible and the House will take up the motion for removal for debate.The motion will then have to be passed by each House, supported by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than twothirds of the members of the House present and voting.It will then be presented to the President for removal of the judge. A notice for motion of removal against the judge can be moved in Rajya Sabha if 50 or more MPs sign the motion, and in Lok Sabha if 100 or more MPs agree to put their signatures to it","A notice for motion of removal against the judge can be moved in Rajya Sabha if 50 or more MPs sign the motion.

NEW DELHI: Amid rising tensions within the Congress party, the BJP has rallied around opposition MP Shashi Tharoor, who is facing criticism from his own colleagues over remarks made during an international delegation visit.Tharoor’s statements lauding India’s recent counterterror strikes have sparked sharp reactions from fellow Congress leader Udit Raj, prompting BJP leaders to question the Congress’s stance on national interest.Union minister Kiren Rijiju took to X on Wednesday to condemn the grand old party, responding to Udit Raj’s criticism of Tharoor. Sharing a video, Rijiju questioned the party's priorities: “Congress ka haath kiske sath? Kya Congress party mein desh ke liye bolna mana hai?” he posted in Hindi.“We Indians must speak in one voice in crucial time at least,” he added.In another post, Rijiju intensified his criticism, “What does the Congress party want & how much they really care for the country? Should the Indian MPs go to foreign nation and speak against India and its Prime Minister? There’s limit to political desperation!”BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla echoed Rijiju’s sentiments, alleging that Congress leader Udit Raj was targeting Tharoor under the influence of Rahul Gandhi.He framed the row as a case of internal sabotage. “Shashi Tharoor is being attacked at the behest of Rahul Gandhi because Shashi Tharoor kept India first not (Gandhi) family. He talked about national interest, not his party’s interest. He is being attacked because he kept national policy above the vote bank (politics),” Poonawalla told PTI.He accused the Congress of hypocrisy: asserting support for the armed forces in an all-party meeting, while launching “missiles at its own leader” abroad.“The Congress, which is launching missiles at its own leader, won’t say a word against Pakistan,” he said.The row stems from Tharoor’s recent remarks during an official address in Panama, where he was representing India as part of a multi-party delegation. Tharoor spoke about India’s evolving counter-terrorism posture, referencing key military operations.“What has changed in recent years is that the terrorists have also realised they will have a price to pay; on that, let there be no doubt. When, for the first time, India breached the Line of Control between India and Pakistan to conduct a surgical strike on a terror base, a launch pad – the Uri strike in September 2015. That was already something we had not done before. Even during the Kargil War, we had not crossed the Line of Control; in Uri, we did, and then came the attack in Pulwama in January 2019. This time, we crossed not only the Line of Control but also the international border, and we struck the terrorist headquarters in Balakot. This time, we have gone beyond both of those. We have not only gone beyond the Line of Control and the international border. We have struck at the Punjabi heartland of Pakistan by hitting terror bases, training centres, and terror headquarters in nine places,” Tharoor said.Udit Raj, however, took serious objection, accusing Tharoor of undermining the Congress’s legacy. “How could you denigrate the golden history of Congress by saying that before PM Modi, India never crossed LOC and the international border?” Raj posted on X.He pointed to India’s military actions during the 1965 and 1971 wars, as well as strikes under the UPA, to challenge Tharoor’s narrative. “Congress MP Shashi Tharoor has become the super spokesperson of the BJP, speaking in favour of PM Modi and his government,” Raj told ANI.As the rift widens, Tharoor finds himself caught between praise from political opponents and rebuke from within his own party.Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram, Tharoor, is currently leading an all-party delegation to countries in Americas for Centre's resolve of global outreach of India's recent counterterror Operation Sindoor.",Opposition MP Shashi Tharoor is facing criticism from his own colleagues.

44 MLAs ready to form Manipur government: NDA group to governor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/44-mlas-ready-to-form-manipur-government-nda-group-to-governor/articleshow/121475600.cms,"Photo/Agencies

BJP brass will decide on govt formation: Manipur MLA

IMPHAL: A group of 10 MLAs led by BJP's Thokchom Radheshyam met Manipur governor Ajay Bhalla on Wednesday to convey their readiness to form a govt in the state which has been under President's Rule since Feb.The group claimed support of 44 NDA legislators. Independent MLA Sapam Nishikant Singh spoke in the same vein.The 44 MLAs mentioned by Radheyshyam include 30 of 37 BJP legislators, including former CM N Biren Singh; six NPP MLAs; all five NPF MLAs; the lone JD(U) MLA; and two of three Independents. The seven remaining BJP legislators, two Kuki People's Alliance members and one Independent, all belonging to the Kuki-Zo community, are not part of this group.The 60-member Manipur assembly currently has 59 MLAs, with one seat vacant due to the death N Kayisii, who represented Tadubi constituency. Opposition Congress has five members.While BJP refrained from commenting on the development, there were indications that the group of 10 could not have acted unilaterally.Manipur has been under President's Rule since Feb after Biren Singh resigned as CM amid criticism about his govt's handling of the ethnic clashes between Meiteis and Kuki-Zos.The assembly, which has been under suspended animation, can be revived any time before the current spell of President's Rule expires on Aug 13, should BJP decide to form another govt.Radheshyam was vague on whether the initiative for the meeting with the governor had been sanctioned by the BJP brass. ""The central leadership of BJP will take the decision,"" he quipped.Significantly, he revealed that Speaker Thokchom Satyabrata Singh has ""individually and jointly"" sounded the 44 MLAs and that there is no one who opposes the formation of a new govt. ""We are ready to stake a claim to form a govt,"" he added.""People have faced so my hardships. In the previous term, two years were lost due to Covid, and in this term, another two years have been lost due to the conflict,"" said Radheshyam, emphasising the need for the return of a political dispensation in Imphal.The development comes amid intense protests in the Imphal Valley over an order by security forces to conceal the state's name - Manipur - on the windshield of a govt bus.Meitei groups demanded an official apology from the governor over the incident that happened in Gwaltabi on May 20, and the resignation of the chief secretary, the DGP and the security adviser.More than 250 people have died since the ethnic strife broke out on May 3, 2023, in the state. Meitei groups maintain that the territorial integrity of the state is non-negotiable in any peace process, while the Kuki-Zos assert that the only solution to resolve the crisis is creating a separate administration for the hill districts where they live.","A group of 10 MLAs led by BJP's Thokchom Radheshyam met Manipur governor Ajay Bhalla on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: India is set to hold civil defence mock drills on Thursday across four states bordering Pakistan, including Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab, and Jammu and Kashmir.The drills aim to test emergency response coordination and civilian evacuation strategies in case of cross-border hostilities or terror-related incidents.Government officials said the exercise would involve local civil defence teams, police, disaster response units, and medical staff.The drill is intended to test emergency response coordination, civilian evacuation protocols, and inter-agency communication in case of cross-border hostilities or terrorist incidentsThe mock drill comes just weeks after India launched Operation Sindoor on the night of May 6–7, a retaliatory strike reportedly targeting terror camps and military infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK). The operation was a response to the terror attack in Pahalgam on April 22, which claimed the lives of 26 civilians.India's counter-attack prompted Pakistan to launch its strikes on Indian military sites and urban areas. In response, India hit at least nine Pakistani air bases, including radar and air defence units. After several days of high-intensity action, Pakistan requested a ceasefire, which India accepted on May 10.",India set to hold civil defence mock drills on Thursday across four states bordering Pakistan.

Poll Should political parties prioritize national unity over political rivalry, especially on security issues? Yes, national unity should come first No, political rivalry is necessary

Game of narrative



Learning from the past or just opportunism?



Congress ups the ante



How government has responded



NEW DELHI: ""If terrorism is a rabid dog, Pakistan is its vile handler. We must first unite the world to tackle this wild handler—else it will continue to breed more rabid dogs,"" boomed TMC general secretary Abhishek Banerjee ’s emotional voice to thunderous applause from the Indian diaspora in Tokyo.The rest of Abhishek's speech was in sync with what the government has repeatedly reiterated. He said Pakistan was given ample time to clean its house, and when it refused to act, India — “honourable in action” — decimated nine terror establishments across the border without harming civilian infrastructure.Abhishek's succinct portrayal of India’s modus operandi to the global community has been eclipsed only by Shashi Tharoor in the opposition ranks, who not only took Pakistan to the cleaners but, in his suave manner, blasted Donald Trump’s repeated hyphenation of India-Pakistan and his boastful claim of using trade as leverage to broker peace.Tharoor's jab at “gentleman” Trump may have earned him further plaudits among a growing mass of admirers, but Congress is unlikely to gain political brownie points from it. Its barely hidden contempt for Tharoor’s freewheeling, independent stance, evident in not nominating him for the all-party meet is another example of an organisation that has failed to read the room and has shown strategic tone-deafness. Congress, despite its diplomatic pedigree, missed an opportunity to leverage its best communicator on foreign soil.As a former Under-Secretary-General of the UN and MoS MEA, Tharoor holds elite credentials to lucidly elucidate India’s stance on terror, and not nominating the four-time MP is certainly not a fair assessment of his skillset.Incidentally, the government had sought to overrule both Congress and TMC in nominating leaders of its choice. In TMC's case, in the absence of the ailing Sudip Banerjee, it nominated Yusuf Pathan , while Tharoor was incidentally named as head of the group visiting the US and four other countries. While TMC put its foot down and insisted on selecting its own representative, eventually ensuring that Abhishek Banerjee flew to Tokyo, Congress neither managed to persuade the ruling dispensation nor dissuade Tharoor from leading the delegation.Even in domestic optics, Congress appears to be trailing. Regarding the visit to Poonch, Congress seems to have taken a leaf out of TMC’s book. According to J&K CM Omar Abdullah, it was the TMC that initiated the process of visiting Poonch, which bore the brunt of Pakistan’s barbarism during Operation Sindoor , leading to the deaths of innocent civilians.Abhishek Banerjee visiting Rash Behari Bose's grave in Tokyo, a key aide of Netaji, has resonated with Bengali nationalists. Taking cue from Abhishek, the rest of the delegation, along with the Indian ambassador, went to pay their respects, which TMC touted as “Bengal showing the way.”Netaji's grandnephew Chandra Bose, too, praised Abhishek Banerjee for visiting the historic site. When contacted by the Times of India, former BJP leader Chandra Kumar Bose was emphatic that this is the time for national unity and that TMC is doing what any responsible party should do. He hoped that Congress too would mellow its belligerence and keep all the probing questions for a later day, probably once Parliament is in session. His impassioned plea to all political parties is to maintain communal harmony and not be swayed by the evil designs of the Pahalgam terrorists.Professor Sibaji Pratim Basu believes there is more than meets the eye in TMC's extremely well-calibrated stance post-Operation Sindoor. He argues that with assembly elections due in Bengal in a year, the party is in no mood to put a foot wrong. However, once the election draws closer, TMC may well tighten the screws on the BJP, questioning why the government didn’t go for the jugular and attempt to take PoK. The likes of Madhya Pradesh BJP minister Vijay Shah passing disparaging comments against Colonel Sofiya Qureshi will also be raised before the appropriate electorate, Basu believes.As for Congress, he contends that the party is willing to play hardball because this year is relatively election-free until the end — and in any case, it isn’t a major player in Bihar. According to him, the lack of effective messaging remains the biggest flaw in Rahul Gandhi ’s political playbook. The fact that Shashi Tharoor has provided a ringing endorsement of India’s policy regarding Operation Sindoor, Basu predicts, will be used by the BJP to blunt the pointed queries of the grand old party in Parliament.Political analyst Professor Subhamoy Maitra looks at TMC's strategy through a critical lens. He believes TMC is a party that isn’t ideologically driven. It operates through meticulous political planning in an opportunistic fashion. Maitra minces no words and calls TMC a “political chameleon” — hawkish on foreign policy one day, repositioning itself as a peacenik the next, if the situation demands. According to the veteran analyst, TMC, assured of a lion’s share of the minority vote, is now also trying to make the right noises for the majority community ahead of the assembly election next year.Maitra believes Abhishek Banerjee's visit hits the mark politically, but can’t help wondering if the entire episode — from Yusuf Pathan’s withdrawal to the TMC general secretary stepping in — was a well-coordinated political stunt. As for Congress, Professor Maitra believes the grand old party is staying true to its centrist roots and is therefore shying away from completely mirroring the BJP on a national security issue. He infers that the party is merely leveraging the lack of transparency in the India–US equation.Professor Basu and many others believe TMC has learnt from past missteps. After the Pulwama attack, Mamata Banerjee had taken a controversial stance by asking for proof of India’s assault on Balakot. It didn’t play out well with the masses, and the BJP had a field day branding her anti-national. At a 2019 election rally in Kolkata, PM Modi said, “Kolkata’s Didi was more pained than people in Islamabad and Rawalpindi…Leaders of the mahagathbandhan...shouted so much that they became heroes in Pakistan.”Politics is often driven by narrative — and that’s where TMC had failed to read the tea leaves post-Balakot. Other opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, who campaigned hard on alleged corruption in the Rafale deal, were humbled in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. The BJP, surprisingly, delivered its best-ever performance in Bengal, winning 18 of the state’s 42 seats.From the clarion call to annex PoK to Abhishek’s pointed “rabid dog” analogy, TMC is eager to match the BJP’s fervent nationalistic pitch. Congress, on the other hand, after a muted response during Operation Sindoor, has upped the political ante. Its sharp attack on S Jaishankar for what felt like a clearly out-of-context comment has baffled many. Congress leader Pawan Khera has already referred to Jaishankar as Jaichand, the medieval ruler who helped “outsider” Muhammad Ghori defeat Prithviraj Chauhan.Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi has posted on X calling the External Affairs Minister “JJ,” posing three questions and claiming “India’s foreign policy has collapsed.” While what “JJ” means is open to interpretation, the phrasing of the questions virtually endorses Trump’s assertions about brokering peace.Sure, the government should clarify Trump’s claims, and when asked on foreign soil, Jaishankar cheekily said, “The US was in the United States” during Operation Sindoor. Tharoor again rightly dissected Trump’s logic, exposing its transactional underbelly and performative bravado. But the rest of Congress seems more interested in scoring quick hits than crafting a coherent foreign policy stance.As for the accusation that Jaishankar informed Pakistan in advance, even P Chidambaram has responded in guarded fashion. He told Indian Express that Rahul Gandhi rightly asked, and the MEA has clarified, hence, “I have no further comment.” Where Congress could have genuinely grilled the government was on why the Pahalgam attackers haven’t been caught even after a month, or how the attack was allowed to happen in the first place. Instead, it went off-script, launching personal tirades — a risky strategy at a time when the nation appears united behind Operation Sindoor.Jaishankar, on his part, has clarified in the Consultative Committee of Parliament that Pakistan was only informed after India had hit the terror targets. According to sources, he also cleared the air on Trump’s mediation claims, stating emphatically that the ceasefire was initiated solely through bilateral discussion after Pakistan reached out. Congress sources, however, maintain that they are not fully satisfied with the explanation provided.PM Modi, too, speaking from his home state, indirectly addressed Trump’s claim, stating that it was Pakistan that couldn’t bear India’s military onslaught and waved the white flag. Appealing to the good sense of Pakistani citizens, he urged them to remove their country from the clutches of terrorism. If the red lines are crossed,""the bullets are ready,” came the dire warning.It remains to be seen how Congress responds to this emphatic assertion from PM Modi about how events unfolded during Operation Sindoor. So far, Congress’s messaging has appeared muddled and misdirected, a sharp contrast to its INDIA ally, TMC. The likes of Alka Lamba’s gaffe, calling Operation Sindoor “Operation Blue Star,” have certainly not helped its cause. There may still be time to course-correct, but for now, TMC has emerged as the craftier and more calibrated opposition.In a year where perception may outweigh ideology, the real contest may be between message discipline and narrative drift.","Congress missed an opportunity to leverage its best communicator on foreign soil, writes Sibaji Pratim Basu. Basu: TMC may well tighten the screws on the government once the election draws closer. The likes of Madhya Pradesh BJP minister Vijay Shah are questioning why the government didn’t go for the jugular.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121462096,imgsize-1160317,width-400,resizemode-4/121462096.jpg"

NAINITAL: To address Nainital's parking crisis, MHA Wednesday issued formal directives allocating the premises of the Metropole Hotel to the Uttarakhand government for temporary use as a parking facility.Built in 1880, the hotel once belonged to the Raja of Mehmoodabad, who migrated to Pakistan. A luxury destination in its prime, it famously hosted figures such as Pakistan's founding father, Mohd Ali Jinnah, who spent his honeymoon there. It was designated 'enemy property' in the early 1960s.MHA's decision follows a request by CM Pushkar Singh Dhami, who cited the town's acute parking shortage and proposed using the hotel's expansive grounds, capable of accommodating over 1,000 vehicles, for public parking. According to a state govt communique, home minister Amit Shah responded positively, confirming MHA's approval in an official letter to the CM. Thanking Shah, Dhami said the move would ""significantly ease traffic congestion and improve logistical convenience in the region.

JAISALMER: A state government employee was detained on Wednesday in Rajasthan on suspicion of spying for Pakistan's spy agency ISI amid a widening crackdown on espionage networks across the country after Operation Sindoor.Sakur Khan Mangaliyar, employed with the state's employment department, was picked up by a joint team of CID and intelligence agencies from his office in Jaisalmer. Mangaliyar is expected to be transferred to Jaipur for further questioning.Authorities are also probing a suspected connection between Mangaliyar and a senior Congress politician from the border region. Security agencies have withheld comment on political links. Sources said Mangaliyar served as a personal assistant to a Congress functionary during the previous Congress-led state govt.Mangaliyar, a resident of Mangaliya's Dhani in Baroda village near the Pakistan border, had been under surveillance for several weeks. Investigators found multiple Pakistani phone numbers in his mobile device and reported that he could not provide credible explanations. He also admitted to traveling to Pakistan at least seven times in recent years, raising further concerns.SP Sudhir Chaudhary said the inquiry began following alerts from ""higher headquarters"" over suspicious activities. ""We are verifying all facts and conducting an inquiry,"" he added.Though no military-related photos or videos were found on his phone, officials said several files had been deleted. Two bank accounts under his name are currently under scrutiny. Intelligence sources revealed possible links between Mangaliyar and an official in Pakistan's embassy, suggesting coordination with ISI handlers.His detention follows a string of arrests across Punjab and Haryana connected to spying for Pakistan. Since May 7, when India launched Operation Sindoor in response to the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people, at least seven suspects have been arrested in espionage-related cases in the two states.Among them is Hisar-based travel vlogger Jyoti Malhotra, accused of passing sensitive data to Pakistani handlers. On May 11, Punjab police arrested two people in Malerkotla. Haryana police detained two on May 13 and May 15. Two people working inside Bathinda military station were held on May 7 and May 14 on similar charges.","Sakur Khan Mangaliyar, employed with the state's employment department, was picked up by a joint team of CID and intelligence agencies.

NEW DELHI: The SC on Wednesday asked the Assam Human Rights Commission (AHRC) to inquire into 171 alleged incidents of fake encounters carried out by state police in 2021 but said barring a few incidents the PIL petitioner's claim about fake encounters appeared to be speculative.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh disposed of a petition by an advocate Arif M Y Jwadder and said, ""We direct the AHRC to issue a public notice inviting all individuals who claim to be aggrieved (victims and their family members) by the alleged police encounters to come forward and furnish relevant evidence.""Allowing AHRC to select team of police officials unconnected to the encounters for further inquiry into some cases if the need be, the bench said ""fair and impartial inquiry"" is a right of citizens aggrieved by police action and expected AHRC to adopt robust measures akin to witness protection protocols to safeguard the privacy, safety and security of those participating in the inquiry process.The state, in its counter-affidavit had said that out of a total of 171 cases, chargesheets have been filed in 125 cases, forwarding reports submitted in 23 cases, and remaining 23 cases are under investigation. Writing the judgment and examining the allegations of the petitioner, Justice Kant said that he has failed to independently place on record any cogent or verifiable material to substantiate the allegations.Justice Kant said, ""After minutely scanning such data, prima facie it seems that barring a few cases, it is difficult to infer that there has been a procedural breakdown, or the guidelines (relating to encounter inquiry) were flagrantly violated. "" Referring to the status report relating to each FIR furnished by Assam, the bench said, ""These documents prima facie belies the (petitioner's) claim of inaction and do establish that, at least at the foundational level, the criminal process was duly initiated.

MUMBAI: A 40-year-old man from Worli has been sentenced to four months of rigorous imprisonment after his pet husky bit his neighbour inside an apartment lift. The man, Rishab Patel, was convicted on charges of voluntarily causing hurt and negligent conduct with an animal.Judicial magistrate Suhas Bhosale, while delivering the verdict, said he would not show Patel ""too much leniency"". Referring to CCTV footage, the judge noted, ""The way in which the accused dragged his pet inside lift shows he is not compassionate towards his own pet. He did not care about the informant, his son and dragged his own pet inside the lift... the act... resulted in injury.""The victim, Ramik Shah, a resident of Alfa Apartment in Worli, was heading down from the fourth floor with his one-and-a-half-year-old son and domestic help. When the lift stopped at the third floor, Patel was standing with his dog. Shah said he requested Patel to wait, explaining that his son was cynophobic (afraid of dogs). However, Patel allegedly ignored the request and did not even allow them to exit. Instead, he dragged his dog into the lift, which bit Shah on his left forearm. After the incident, Shah, his son, and the help exited the lift, but Patel allegedly followed them and challenged Shah to ""do whatever he wanted.""Shah later sought medical treatment and filed a police complaint.During the trial, the prosecution presented oral evidence from the victim, Ramik Shah, and his domestic help, Anuj Singh, who confirmed Patel had forcibly entered the lift with the dog despite repeated requests.The defence pointed to inconsistencies, including a delay in medical treatment and the initial absence of administration of anti-rabies vaccine for the victim. However, the magistrate found the testimonies of both Shah and Singh consistent and credible. ""Only because the witness is servant of the first informant we cannot brush aside his evidence if it is otherwise trustworthy,"" he ruled. Holding Patel's actions as ""voluntary,"" the court fined him Rs 4,000 in addition to sentencing him to jail.","Rishab Patel, 40, was convicted on charges of voluntarily causing hurt and negligent conduct with an animal.

NEW DELHI/GUWAHATI: Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma and newly appointed Assam Congress president Gaurav Gogoi continued to skirmish on Wednesday over the former's charge that his opponent had quietly visited Pakistan.While Gogoi said the CM's ""ludicrous and ridiculous"" allegations were part of an unsuccessful political plot to sow seeds of doubt in the mind of Congress brass and discourage them from appointing him the state unit chief, Sarma claimed his charge had been validated with the Congress neta finally ""admitting"" that he had visited Pakistan. CM also said Gogoi had been economical with facts and police would soon bring out the full truth.Addressing a press conference, Gogoi said his wife, ""a well-known expert in public policy"", worked on an international project in south Asia on climate change, and spent a year in Pakistan before returning to India around 2012-13. She later took up a new job in 2015 and he too went to Pakistan once in 2013. He said the people of Assam had known these facts during the 11-year term of BJP-led Centre, which conducts background checks on opposition members, especially those like him who speak freely in Parliament.Sarma took to X to say Gogoi's ""admission"" that he did travel to Pakistan was just the tip of the iceberg of his links with the enemy country and his govt would reveal the full story through its investigative report on Sept 10. ""Today he admitted (going to Pakistan) because he knows Sept 10 is approaching. But he has made a very false statement (that he went to visit his wife). It was an independent visit, approved by the Interior Department of Pakistan,"" he said. ""What I will reveal on Sept 10 will make Rahul Gandhi regret appointing such a person to a leadership role,"" Sarma said, adding, ""There are serious national security concerns at stake...""Gogoi said, ""The CM has said he will make revelations on Sept 10. Is this a movie? This is a sensitive issue and he should reveal now what he has. BJP 's job is defamation and they are creating this whole thing like a C-grade Bollywood movie which will flop miserably.""Sarma had written, ""This is just the beginning, not the end. What lies ahead is far more serious. There exists every reasonable ground, supported by credible inputs and documented information, to suggest that Shri Gogoi has maintained proximity with the Pakistani establishment."" He also alleged Gogoi's British wife was ""snooping on our IB"" on behalf of a climate activist group ""and I have documents to prove that"".Gogoi alleged the CM's ""smear campaign"" is a tactic to cover up the activities of his own family, adding he has amassed huge wealth and property through his family, which heads 17 companies and gets benefits of govt contracts. He further said illegal coal and drugs had emerged as the ""biggest diseases"" of northeast under BJP's patronage, and the reality of the region was far from the claims made during the ""rising North East summit"", which was addressed by PM Narendra Modi.","Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma and newly appointed Assam Congress president Gaurav Gogoi continued to skirmish on Wednesday.

"Pakistan silent on drone attacks as South Waziristan strike injures 22, fuels outrage",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistan-silent-on-drone-attacks-as-south-waziristan-strike-injures-22-fuels-outrage/articleshow/121473761.cms,"Photo/Agencies

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan remains tight-lipped on a wave of drone attacks in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, with a suspected quadcopter strike injuring 22 civilians, including seven minors, during a volleyball match in Azam Warsak, South Waziristan, on Tuesday night.The attack, echoing a deadly May 19 strike in North Waziristan that killed four children, has sparked fury over the govt’s silence and lack of accountability in the volatile tribal regions bordering Afghanistan.The latest assault, security locals said, occurred around 8 pm local time, targeting civilians aged 13 to 60. A 13-year-old boy and an adult male were critically injured and transferred to tertiary care, with seven others severely wounded. “We were playing volleyball when the explosion hit, followed by gunfire. It was pure panic,” said a resident, requesting anonymity.The North Waziristan attack in Hurmuz village on May 19 had led to an eight-day sit-in at Mir Ali town. Locals accused authorities of targeting civilians under counter-terrorism pretexts. The military’s media affairs wing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), denied involvement, blaming the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), but offered no clarity.Tuesday’s strike follows a pattern of unclaimed attacks. In March 2025, 11 civilians, including women and children, died in Mardan in an attack that locals said was delivered by drones, though authorities claimed it targeted militants.In Sept 2024, a drone strike in Upper South Waziristan killed one and injured three, with no official response. Historically, US drone strikes in Pakistan’s tribal areas, peaking between 2004 and 2018, drew fierce condemnation for civilian casualties. Pakistan’s protests against US operations, including diplomatic complaints to the UN, contrasted with its own use of armed quadcopters against alleged TTP militants in tribal districts and other parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa since 2020, often without acknowledging civilian tolls.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has demanded independent probes, citing violations of due process in both foreign and domestic strikes.Islamabad’s silence on the latest attack fuels distrust. Pakistan attributes tribal violence to groups like TTP, as in the ISPR’s North Waziristan response, but its failure to address quadcopter incidents — whether by state forces or militants — deepens local resentment. “If drones keep targeting Waziristan, how do we answer our people,” an elder asked during the Mir Ali protests, a sentiment amplified after Tuesday’s attack. Civilians, particularly children, bear the brunt of conflict in a region scarred by militancy and military operations.","Pakistan remains tight-lipped on a wave of drone attacks in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

SRINAGAR: CM Omar Abdullah renewed Wednesday demand for restoring statehood to J&K, saying political discourse around reversing Union territory status remains active and ongoing.“Conversation around statehood hasn’t died down,” Omar said after chairing a meeting of administrative secretaries in Gulmarg. “A recent Niti Aayog document, also shared with the PM and members of Aayog, categorically mentioned restoring statehood to J&K. ”Omar, however, opposed the suggestion of convening a special assembly session to push the demand. “That’s the only point I disagreed on,” he said.Parliament repealed Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019, ending J&K’s special status, and govt restructured the region into two Union territories — including Ladakh. Regional parties widely opposed the move and restoration has remained a consistent political demand in J&K.Omar also pushed efforts to revive tourism in Kashmir following the terrorist attack in Pahalgam that halted visitor activity across the region. “Tourism stopped completely after April 22. Before expecting tourists from rest of country, we must go ourselves,” he said, referencing back-to-back official meetings in Pahalgam and Gulmarg this week.He urged schools and colleges to resume excursions to tourist spots “to move a little towards normalcy”.Omar also demanded investigation into rising calls on social media to boycott Kashmir, calling such campaigns unjustified. “People of J&K strongly condemned the Pahalgam attack. After April 22, Kashmiris came out saying loudly, ‘Not in our name’,” he said.He urged Union govt to deploy intelligence agencies to trace origins of boycott calls. “The attack wasn’t carried out by Kashmiris, nor did anyone force tourists out. If, even after that, blame continues, what more are Kashmiris expected to do?” he asked.The CM highlighted need for coordination among three “power centres” — J&K’s elected govt, LG’s office, and Union government — to ensure safety. “I can build infrastructure and promote tourism, but security is under LG’s jurisdiction,” he said. “We must collaborate so April 22 doesn’t repeat.”","“Conversation around statehood hasn’t died down,” Omar said after chairing a meeting of administrative secretaries in Gulmarg.

LUCKNOW: A key sharpshooter and active member of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, Naveen Kumar (37), was killed in a late night encounter with a joint team of UP STF and Delhi Police’s Special Cell on Wednesday night.The operation was launched based on intelligence inputs about the presence of wanted criminals in the region. When intercepted, the suspects opened fire at the police team, triggering a fierce gun battle, said ADG, law and order, Amitabh Yash.Yash said Naveen Kumar, a resident of Loni in Ghaziabad, was critically injured in the exchange of fire. He was rushed to a hospital where doctors declared him dead.Naveen Kumar was a notorious gangster wanted in over 20 cases, including murder, attempted murder, kidnapping, dacoity, and serious charges under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), said police.Additional SP, STF, RK Mishra said Naveen was convicted in two murder cases in Delhi and was absconding despite being sentenced by the court.Naveen was considered one of the most trusted operatives of Hashim Baba, another top lieutenant of jailed gangster Lawrence Bishnoi. Together, they were involved in multiple extortion and contract killing operations across Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.“Naveen Kumar was a habitual offender, a sharpshooter and a trusted enforcer for the Bishnoi network.His elimination is a major blow to the gang’s active module in western UP and Delhi-NCR,” said a senior STF official.The STF and Special Cell had been monitoring Bishnoi gang movements for several months as part of a larger crackdown on inter-state criminal networks. The operation in Hapur was launched after inputs suggested that Naveen was planning to regroup with other gang members for a possible targeted killing.","Naveen Kumar was a notorious gangster wanted in over 20 cases.

JAMMU: A bomb disposal squad was deployed to secure and defuse three live mortar shells found Wednesday near the regional transport officer’s office in Jammu’s Transport Nagar area.Officials have not confirmed whether the ordnance originated from Pakistani forces during cross-border shelling triggered by India’s Operation Sindoor that targeted and destroyed terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan early this May. Pakistani fire has included mortars and artillery, with several unexploded shells reported near civilian zones near the border.“A local spotted one shell and alerted police,” said an officer. “Two more were discovered upon inspection.” Police cordoned off the area and summoned bomb experts. “Preliminary assessment suggests these are old mortar shells, possibly dumped here, but still capable of causing serious damage,” the officer said.On May 16, security forces defused a mortar shell spotted by villagers in Bishnah, believed to have been fired from across the border during Operation Sindoor.Police found a suspected IED during a patrol in Gharota area on Jammu’s outskirts on October 5, 2024.

The high-profile sexual assault trial involving five members of Canada’s 2018 World Junior Hockey team continued this week with a police interview from New Jersey Devils forward Michael McLeod taking center stage in court. McLeod, one of the accused, described the night in question at a London, Ontario hotel in June 2018 as “weird,” sharing details of events that unfolded after a night of drinking at a downtown bar.In the 2018 interview with London police detective Stephen Newton, played in court on Tuesday, McLeod recalled returning to his hotel room with a 20-year-old woman he met at Jack’s Bar on Richmond Row. He said the two had consensual sex, and later teammates began arriving at his room for food and socializing.The situation quickly became more complicated. According to McLeod, the woman began offering sex to others in the room and became frustrated when they declined.“I was trying to make sure she was okay because this is, like, a weird situation that I wasn’t expecting was going to happen with all the guys coming in,” McLeod told police. “I just made sure she was okay with this.”McLeod said he filmed a video of the woman affirming her consent to the activity taking place.He claimed the group, though intoxicated, was coherent and that several players, some in relationships, did not participate.While McLeod said he tried to manage the escalating situation, including discouraging group sex in front of others, he also admitted that oral sex and further sexual encounters occurred between the woman and other players.“She got upset... I had to, kind of, calm her down and say ‘are you okay?’ Literally, I told her no one is going to have sex in front of nine other guys,” McLeod stated.After the gathering ended around 4 a.m., McLeod said the woman was upset over a lost ring. He later messaged her on Instagram, learning from her that her mother had called the police. When asked if he had regrets, McLeod said: “I’d probably just shut it down right away... probably go.” The trial remains ongoing as further testimonies are expected.Also Read: Women’s advocates use Hockey Canada sexual assault trial to confront players with hard lessons on consent","Michael McLeod, one of the accused, described the night in question at a London, Ontario hotel in June 2018 as “weird,” sharing details of events that unfolded after a night of drinking at a downtown bar.

Trump Warns Netanyahu Not To Derail Iran Deal In ‘Tense’ Call Claims Report





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday claimed he asked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to delay any military action against Iran amid ongoing nuclear negotiations.""Well, I'd like to be honest, yes I did,"" Trump said when asked if he had told Netanyahu in a call last week not to take any action that could disrupt Washington's talks with Tehran.Pressed on what he told the Israeli Prime Minister, Trump replied: ""I just said I don't think it's appropriate, we're having very good discussions with them.""He added: ""I told him this would be inappropriate to do right now because we're very close to a solution.""I think they want to make a deal, and if we can make a deal, save a lot of lives.""According to Times of Israel, Netanyahu and Trump had engaged in a heated phone call last week over how to confront Iran.Trump reportedly told Netanyahu, “I want a diplomatic solution with the Iranians. I believe in my ability to make a good deal.” He emphasized his preference for a negotiated agreement that serves both sides' interests.Meanwhile, Trump signaled potential progress in the talks with Tehran, suggesting that a breakthrough announcement could come within days.""We've had some very, very good talks with Iran. And I don't know if I'll be telling you anything good or bad over the next two days, but I have a feeling I might be telling you something good,"" Trump said while speaking in northern New Jersey.""We've had some real progress, serious progress. Let's see what happens, but I think we could have some good news on the Iran front,"" he added.Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and US State Department policy planning director Michael Anton represented the United States during the latest (fifth) round of talks with Iran, held over the weekend at the Omani embassy in Rome.These Oman-mediated negotiations, which began in April, mark the highest-level direct contact between the two nations since the US exited the 2015 Iran nuclear deal during Trump’s first term. Since returning to office in January, Trump has revived his “maximum pressure” strategy while remaining open to diplomacy — though warning of military action if talks fail.Iran, for its part, seeks a new deal that would ease crippling economic sanctions. However, following the latest talks, Iranian Foreign Minister and chief negotiator Abbas Araghchi urged caution, stating that “the negotiations are too complicated to be resolved in two or three meetings.”Oman’s foreign minister echoed this sentiment, saying the talks concluded with “some but not conclusive progress.” The latest round took place ahead of a key June meeting of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is set to review Iran’s nuclear activities.","US President Donald Trump claims he asked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to delay any military action against Iran.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday confirmed that Hamas commander Mohammed Sinwar was killed in an Israeli airstrike on May 13. Speaking before parliament on Wednesday, Netanyahu included Sinwar in a list of Hamas leaders killed by Israel in the war-battered enclave.This was first official acknowledgment of Sinwar’s death following earlier statements by defense minister Israel Katz in mid-May.IDF sources had expressed skepticism about foreign media reports claiming Sinwar’s body was recovered alongside about a dozen aides, including Rafah brigade chief Mohammed Shabanah, seen as Sinwar’s likely successor. However, sources told The Jerusalem Post that the two Hamas leaders were together at the time of the strike, making it highly probable both were killed.The strike on May 13 involved heavy bombing of a Hamas tunnel complex beneath a hospital in Gaza, where Sinwar was believed to be hiding.Mohammed Sinwar had taken over as Hamas leader after his brother, Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the October 7 attacks, was killed by Israeli forces in Rafah.

Tommy Robinson gets early release because of ‘change in attitude’

British far-right activist Tommy Robinson walked free on parole earlier today after a UK judge granted his early release from an 18-month sentence for contempt of court . Upon release, Robinson credited tech billionaire Elon Musk and the platform for enabling him to share his version of events. “I have to say a thank you to Elon Musk, because without X, if we didn't have X, everyone would just think I lied. No one would have got any other narrative,"" he said during a livestream to his followers. ""These attempts at censorship, to silence, to cancel people, it hasn't worked. You've attempted to lock up the truth. And that truth has been echoed around the entire globe,"" he added.Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon was jailed for violating a court order prohibiting him from repeating libelous claims about a Syrian refugee, Jamal Hijazi . He was sent to jail in October 2024 for contempt of court after admitting that he broke a legal order. The 42-year-old had accused Hijazi of being a violent bully—allegations a court deemed false.He later featured the claims in a documentary titled Silenced, which he shared on X (formerly Twitter), owned by Elon Musk. Musk has previously expressed support for Robinson, saying he was jailed “for telling the truth” and calling for his release.Justice Jeremy Johnson granted Robinson’s early release, citing a “change in attitude” though with ""absence of contrition or remorse.""""He has given an assurance that he will comply with the injunction in the future, that he has no intention of breaching it again, and that he is aware of the consequences of what would happen if he breached the injunction again,"" the judge said.Robinson admitted in October to breaching the injunction by promoting the Silenced film and discussing the case in media interviews and public rallies. His previous videos about Hijazi reportedly led to widespread harassment of the boy, who dropped out of school and relocated with his family. A 2021 libel case awarded Hijazi £100,000 in damages.A repeat offender, Robinson has previously served time for assault, mortgage fraud, and contempt of court. He remains a polarizing figure in Britain’s far-right circles and retains a sizable following both in the UK and abroad.His legal team has assured that he would comply with the original court order moving forward.",British far-right activist Tommy Robinson walked free on parole earlier today after a UK judge granted his early release from an 18-month sentence for contempt of court.

CHENNAI: At least 30 people, including eight children and 10 women, were left stranded nearly 50 feet above the ground for almost three hours after a roller coaster malfunctioned at an amusement park on Chennai’s East Coast Road on Monday evening.Watch: Video shows panic moments after roller coaster stops mid-air in Chennai The incident occurred around 6pm at the park in Injambakkam, when the “Topgun” ride abruptly stopped mid-cycle following a loud noise.The roller coaster, which climbs vertically before a sharp descent, came to a sudden halt, leaving riders suspended in the air and visibly distressed.Attempts by park staff to resolve the issue using an on-site crane failed, as the equipment could not reach the necessary height. A rescue team was later dispatched from Guindy with a sky-lift vehicle capable of extending up to 150 feet.Rescue operations began around 8.30pm and lasted for about an hour. Fire and rescue personnel distributed water and biscuits to those stuck before lowering each passenger to safety. Medical teams provided first aid on the ground, and no serious injuries were reported.The operation was supervised by Adyar deputy commissioner of police Pon Karthik Kumar.Following the incident, a case was registered and an investigation launched into the park’s safety standards.Preliminary findings suggest the ride had not been properly maintained and had mechanical issues that were ignored by the operators.Several people, including parents of those stuck, later took to social media to criticise the park’s emergency preparedness and questioned why trained staff were not present to assist during the crisis.","At least 30 people, including eight children and 10 women, were left stranded nearly 50 feet above the ground for almost three hours.

BENGALURU: A 22-year-old engineering student in the city has filed a police complaint against her former male partner when she had met on Instagram, accusing him of sexually exploiting her under a false promise of marriage, before quietly slipping out of the country.After moving out of India, accused Nandan (name changed) concocted a story about him getting arrested in Dubai. However, his bluff was called when the victim, Shreya (name changed), using his passport number, tracked him down to Austin, United States.A senior police officer said a case was registered against the accused and his parents under multiple sections of BNS. ""We will be issuing a lookout notice against Nandan. When he lands at any of the airports in India, he will be detained,"" the officer added.Shreya, a final-year college student and resident of South Bengaluru, said in her police complaint that Nandan, 28, a software engineer, had befriended her on Instagram in 2023. Later, in Jan 2024, they met near her house.A month later, when Nandan proposed to her, Shreya told him she won't be able to accept his proposal as she was from the Scheduled Caste, while he was a Brahmin.However, claiming he was madly in love with her, Nandan said he already knew about her caste and it mattered little to him. He then put an ""engagement"" ring on her.In July 2024, Nandan visited Shreya's house on her birthday and got introduced to her mother. He assured her that he would marry Shreya, and the mother accepted their relationship. Thereafter, Nandan was a frequent visitor to their house.He also claimed to have bought an apartment in R R Nagar, which, according to Nandan, would be the couple's home post-wedding. Often, he used to take Shreya to his house in Banashankari, while his parents were away, and also to his R R Nagar apartment.Last September, Nandan forcibly had sex with the victim, saying they were getting married anyway. Thereafter, he had sex with her on multiple occasions.A formal engagement was scheduled at Shreya's house earlier this month, with the wedding slated for June. A pre-wedding photoshoot was also done.Meanwhile, Nandan suddenly started singing to a different tune, telling Shreya that they both ought to give the caste issue a serious thought. On April 23, he messaged her, saying he had landed in Dubai to hide from the authorities he worked for in Russia and China, but got caught. Thereafter, his phone was switched off.Realising that something in Nandan's tale wasn't quite adding up, Shreya used his passport number and found out that he was in Austin, Texas, in the United States, and not in Dubai.She and her father then confronted Nandan's parents with the pre-wedding photos, but Nandan's father didn't let them into his house and allegedly insulted them over their caste. He even told them in as many words that Nandan was sent to the US to avoid getting married to Shreya.","A 22-year-old engineering student in Bengaluru has filed a police complaint against her former male partner.

Not a funeral, just a fungi trip





A scenic hike in the Adirondacks took a wild turn last week after two New York men called in a dramatic 911 report claiming their friend had died on the trail.After discovering them, officials found out that the hikers were apparently high on psychedelic mushrooms and their lost friend was alive.According to the New York department of environmental conservation, forest rangers received the alarming distress call on May 24 near Cascade Mountain. The hikers breathlessly told that their friend had tragically died and that they, too, were hopelessly lost in the wilderness.Rangers quickly located the two callers and found them in what was described as “an altered mental state.”The “dead” hiker, meanwhile, was alive, well, and possibly wondering why his buddies hadn't caught up.The drama ended not with a solemn recovery, but with a confused reunion and an ambulance call, for the stoned duo, not their supposedly deceased friend. Medics were summoned not to revive the dead, but to handle two guys who had mistaken “tripping” for tragedy.","Hikers call 911 over 'dead' friend on trail, turns out they were just high on mushrooms.

BENGALURU: Setting off a row with his remark that ""Kannada was born out of Tamil"" during a film-promotion event in Chennai, actor-politician Kamal Haasan triggered public outrage and sharp political reactions in Karnataka In reply to Kannada and culture minister Shivaraj Tangadagi's demand for an immediate apology to the people of Karnataka, Kamal Haasan clarified that his statement was ""out of love"" and ""love will never apologise"".Kamal Haasan's remark evoked bitter political reactions, state-wide protests and demonstrations. Tangadagi demanded that Kannada actor Shivaraj Kumar , who was present during Kamal's speech, must condemn Kamal's words and urged Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce to consider enforcing a ban on Kamal Haasan's film. ""He must apologise to the people of Karnataka,"" the minister said.Minister Tngadagi said, ""Regardless of the personality, we will tolerate none if they try to defame Kannada language, culture, water or boundary. He must apologise to the people of Karnataka. Being a veteran actor, he should not have commented in such a manner. They (Kamal) need Kannada to act and earn and run their propaganda.Should they be allowed to speak like this? Previously, singer Sonu Nigam courted controversy and apologised. There is a need to teach a lesson to all these people.""Kamal's statement triggered state-wide protests with pro-Kannada outfits staging demonstrations against the actor in Belagavi, Mysuru, Hubballi, and Bengaluru. Karnataka Rakshana Vedike faction of Praveen Shetty lodged a complaint against him at RT Nagar police station, alleging he hurt the sentiments of Kannadigas that triggered unrest between Kannadigas and Tamilians. A senior officer said they forwarded the complaint for legal opinion and they will decide further action based on that. Karnataka BJP chief BY Vijayendra said, ""Disrespecting another language in the name of their mother tongue is nothing but uncultured behaviour. Having acted in several Indian languages, Kamal's attempt to glorify Tamil language, especially in the presence of Kannada actor Shivaraj Kumar, reflects his arrogance and foolishness.""Responding to political outbursts, Kamal Haasan, in Thiruvananthapuram, recalled the diversity Tamil Nadu has seen over the years in the form of multiple chief ministers from different linguistic backgrounds, including the late J Jayalalithaa, who hailed from Mandya in Karnataka.Claiming his response as an 'explanation' and not an 'answer' in a democratic country, Kamal said, ""They (protestors) are confusing the issue. Politicians are not qualified to talk about language, including me. Let's leave all these discussions to historians, archaeologists and language experts.

So, people will take care of ...""Referring to his 'statement of love' on language in the presence of Shivaraj Kumar, Kamal said, ""We (he and Rajkumar family) are a family and so are the languages. If you look at it from a northern point of view, according to them, it is right. If you look at it from Thenkumari (South), what I said was right.

'Nothing here'

'No home'





AL ḨAWĀSH: Aref Shamtan, 73, preferred to pitch a tent near his destroyed home in northwest Syria rather than stay in a camp for the displaced following longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad's ouster.""I feel good here, even among the rubble,"" Shamtan said, sipping tea at the tent near his field.When he and his son returned after Assad's December 8 overthrow, Shamtan found his village of Al-Hawash, nestled among farmland in central Hama province, badly damaged.The roof of their house was gone and its walls were cracked.But ""living in the rubble is better than living in the camps"" near the border with Turkey, where he had been since 2011 after fleeing the fighting, Shamtan said.Since Islamist forces ousted Assad after nearly 14 years of war, 1.87 million Syrians who were refugees abroad or internally displaced have returned to their areas of origin, the United Nations' International Organization for Migration says.The IOM says the ""lack of economic opportunities and essential services pose the greatest challenge"" for those returning home.Shamtan, who cannot afford to rebuild, decided around two months ago to leave the camp with his family and young grandchildren, and has started planting his farmland with wheat.Al-Hawash had been controlled by Assad's forces and was along the front lines with neighbouring Idlib province, which became a bastion for opposition factions, particularly Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the group that led the offensive that toppled Assad.""We can't stay in the camps,"" Shamtan insisted, even if ""the village is all destroyed... and life is non-existent"", lacking basic services and infrastructure.""We decided... to live here until things improve. We are waiting for organisations and the state to help us,"" he said.""Life is tough.""Local official Abdel Ghafour al-Khatib, 72, has also returned after fleeing in 2019 with his wife and children for a camp near the border.""I just wanted to get home. I was overjoyed... I returned and pitched a worn-out tent. Living in my village is the important thing,"" he said.""Everyone wants to return,"" he said. But many cannot even afford the transport to do so in a country where 90 percent of people live in poverty.""There is nothing here -- no schools, no health clinics, no water and no electricity,"" Khatib said, sitting on the ground in the tent near the remains of his home.The war, which erupted in 2011 after Assad's brutal repression of anti-government protests, killed more than 500,000 people and displaced half of the pre-war population internally or abroad, with many fleeing to Idlib province.More than six million people remain internally displaced, according to the IOM.With the recent lifting of Western sanctions, Syria's new authorities hope for international support to launch reconstruction, which the UN estimates could cost more than $400 billion.IOM chief Amy Pope said on Monday that ""the lifting of sanctions sends a powerful message of hope to millions of displaced Syrians"", cautioning, however, that ""hope must be matched with concrete support"".After being repeatedly displaced, Souad Othman, 47, returned with her three daughters and son to Al-Hawash around a week ago.""Everything has changed -- the homes are damaged and there is nothing left in their place,"" said Othman, whose husband died during the war.The roof of her home has collapsed and its walls are cracked, but she still chose to return, eking out a living through manual labour.A small bed sits out in the open, protected only by blankets on a clothesline, with a makeshift cooking area set up on the rubble.She said she borrowed $80 to pay for a battery for two solar panels.""There are snakes and insects here. We can't live without light during the night,"" she said.AFP aerial footage of camps in northwest Syria showed some former structures empty of residents.Jalal al-Omar, 37, who is responsible for part of a camp near the village of Qah in Idlib province, said around 100 families had left for his home village of Treimsa in the Hama region.But around 700 other families cannot afford to return, he said, also noting the lack of infrastructure in Treimsa, where people have to travel miles just to buy bread.""People don't want to stay in the camps, they want to return to their villages. But the lack of essential services... prevents their return,"" he said.""I myself have no home. I'm waiting... for a place to shelter in the village,"" he added.","1.87 million Syrians who were refugees abroad or internally displaced have returned to their areas of origin. ""I feel good here, even among the rubble,"" says 73-year-old Aref Shamtan. Many cannot even afford the transport to do so in a country where 90 percent of people live in poverty.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121479083,imgsize-1189038,width-400,resizemode-4/121479083.jpg"

Premier Wab Kinew has requested federal assistance, including military support, to aid in evacuation and firefighting efforts. The unprecedented scale of the fires, affecting multiple regions, is attributed to changing climate conditions, with significant forest area already scorched.

Wildfires prompt evacuations in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba





The Canadian province of Manitoba declared a state of emergency after the massive wildfire continues to spread in the province, resulting in evacuation of more than 17000 people.Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew announced the decision on Wednesday. The evacuation was essential amid the extreme fire conditions and growing threat to communities across the province.""The Manitoba government has declared a province-wide state of emergency due to the wildfire situation,"" Kinew said.“This is the largest evacuation Manitoba will have seen in most people’s living memory,” he added.Kinew has requested assistance from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney asking for military support to help with evacuation efforts and firefighting.He assured that military aircraft are being deployed to move people from danger zones to safety, alongside additional firefighting resources.Flin Flon, a town in Manitoba and home to about 5,000 residents was among the areas placed under evacuation orders. People there had already been warned to be ready to leave at short notice. Other remote towns and Indigenous communities have also been evacuated, with most residents expected to be relocated to the provincial capital, Winnipeg.One of the evacuees, Sheryl Matheson described the terrifying scene as wildfires surrounded her hometown of Sherridon.“It's been overwhelming. It was very smoky. You could see the fires four or five kilometers away and moving fast,” she told AFP.“The flames were shooting over 121 feet high and firefighters couldn’t get close enough to do anything”, she added.Another resident, Elsaida Alerta, who has lived in Flin Flon for three years, said the evacuation was extremely stressful.""Especially for somebody that lived in a big city (previously), that never had to evacuate, this is definitely nerve-wracking,"" she told CBC.She described the only highway out of town as jammed with traffic, with gas stations running dry.“We basically gathered all our essential things, important documents, medications and things our animals will need,” she said.""We're just gonna make our way and hope for the best"", she added.Premier Kinew said the scale of the fires is a warning sign. ""For the first time, it's not a fire in one region, we have fires in every region. That is a sign of a changing climate that we are going to have to adapt to,"" Kinew said.There are currently 22 wildfires active in the province. According to Kirstin Hayward of the Manitoba wildfire service, ""The wildfire has affected nearly 200,000 hectares of forests that have been scorched in just the past month, or triple the annual average over the previous five years.""""Manitoba has the highest fire activity in Canada so far this year, due in part to a prolonged period of warm and dry conditions,"" she added.About 1,000 residents of Lynn Lake and Marcel Colomb First Nation in Manitoba and 4,000 people from the northern village of Pelican Narrows and other communities in neighboring Saskatchewan had already been evacuated earlier in the week.Across Canada, 134 wildfires are burning, with half considered out of control. Fires are active in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario.Earlier this month, two people died in a wildfire near Lac du Bonnet, northeast of Winnipeg. In 2023, Canada experienced its worst wildfire season on record. The only reported deaths were among firefighters.Kinew said emergency shelters are being set up. Companies and communities across Manitoba were being asked to welcome the evacuees.","Manitoba has declared a province-wide state of emergency due to rapidly spreading wildfires.

Watch: Dramatic footage shows glacier burying Swiss Village,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/watch-dramatic-footage-shows-glacier-burying-swiss-village/articleshow/121477194.cms,"Dramatic footage shows glacier burying Swiss Village

Earthquake and flooding threat

A precarious wait and ongoing threats





A massive section of the Birch Glacier collapsed in the Swiss Alps on Wednesday, unleashing a powerful landslide of ice, mud, and rock that buried nearly the entire village of Blatten in the Valais canton, just over a week after residents were ordered to evacuate.Authorities confirmed that one person is missing and warned that recovery could take years, as drone footage captured the dramatic moment the glacier broke away, sending a towering plume of dust cascading down the mountainside.The glacier, burdened by approximately 9 million tons of debris, had been inching steadily, up to 11 feet per day, toward the Lötschental Valley in recent weeks, prompting evacuations of the village’s 300 residents.“We’ve lost the village, but not the heart,” said mayor Matthias Bellwald at a news conference on Wednesday.Officials estimate that 90% of Blatten has been buried, according to Stéphane Ganzer, a state councillor for Valais. The destruction has also closed the main road connecting Blatten to the nearby village of Goppenstein, cutting off access for all except local residents.The landslide registered as a 3.1 magnitude earthquake, and emergency teams are now closely monitoring a blocked riverbed nearby, which poses a significant risk of ice jams and flooding.Authorities are not ruling out further evacuations and have requested assistance from the Swiss Army to deploy pumps and debris-clearing equipment.Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter shared a photo of the devastation, expressing her condolences, “It is terrible to lose a home. I’m thinking of the people of Blatten.”For nearly two weeks, the fractured glacier loomed ominously above Blatten, a picturesque Alpine hamlet known for its serene beauty and traditional farming lifestyle. As the threat grew, livestock were evacuated, including 52 cattle, sheep, and rabbits. A widely shared video of a cow being airlifted to safety underscored the seriousness of the situation.","A section of the Birch Glacier collapsed in the Swiss Alps on Wednesday, unleashing a powerful landslide of ice, mud, and rock that buried nearly the entire village of Blatten.

"A prison escape, a fake uniform, and 2,000 caves: Inside the hunt for Grant Hardin",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-prison-escape-a-fake-uniform-and-2000-caves-inside-the-hunt-for-grant-hardin/articleshow/121477592.cms,"A prison escape, a fake uniform, and 2,000 caves: Inside the hunt for Grant Hardin

Hardin’s knowledge of the region poses key obstacle

Caves are central focus of search efforts

Authorities urge vigilance as manhunt continues





The hunt for escaped killer and ex-cop Grant Hardin is in its fourth day as law enforcement officers face several obstacles in the rugged wilderness of the Ozark Mountains. With thick forests, abandoned cabins, and one of the highest concentrations of caves in Arkansas, the terrain is proving ideal for a fugitive dubbed “The Devil in the Ozarks. ”Hardin, 56, escaped from the North Central Unit at Calico Rock on Sunday by impersonating a law enforcement officer, a lapse prison officials have called a serious failure in protocol. By the time his absence was noticed, Hardin had a 30-minute head start on foot in a region filled with natural cover and hidden hideouts.“He knows where the caves are,” said Darla Nix, a local café owner whose family knew Hardin. “He’s a survivor — very smart, very quiet. That’s what makes this so difficult.”Search crews, including local, state, and federal agencies, are using dogs, drones, and helicopters to comb through the vast, uneven terrain. But caves, hundreds of them, have become a central challenge in the manhunt.“There are a lot of places to hide and take shelter,” said Rand Champion, spokesman for the Arkansas department of corrections.“We’re talking about abandoned sheds, remote campsites, and caves that go deep underground. That’s been a key focus of our search teams.”Hardin's escape has drawn comparisons to notorious fugitive Eric Rudolph, who evaded capture for years by hiding in the Appalachian Mountains. Experts say someone can survive underground for days or even weeks, especially in the cave-rich environment of the Ozarks.“There are nearly 2,000 documented caves in northern Arkansas,” said Michael Ray Taylor, a caving expert and author. “The entrances can look like nothing — a rabbit hole in the ground — but inside, there are enormous passageways. If someone like Hardin knows them, he could go days without being seen.”Still, Taylor pointed out a major risk: “You have to come out for food. That’s when you’re most vulnerable.”Hardin, a former police officer in multiple Arkansas towns, has a long history of misconduct and violent crime. His law enforcement career ended in disgrace after a series of firings and resignations, including an excessive force incident in Eureka Springs. In 2017, he was sentenced to 30 years for murdering James Appleton, the brother of Gateway’s mayor and 50 years for a 1997 rape.Hardin's past as a police chief and knowledge of the local terrain are making the pursuit even more complex. “He’s not just a fugitive,” said Champion. “He’s someone who knows how we operate.”Authorities continue to urge residents across the Arkansas Ozarks to lock doors, secure vehicles, and report anything suspicious. As of Wednesday, one of the biggest concerns is the network of underground hideouts that could buy Hardin more time and make this manhunt last longer than anyone wants.“We’re not letting up,” said Champion. “But this is a hard place to disappear and a harder one to search.”","Grant Hardin, 56, escaped from the North Central Unit at Calico Rock on Sunday by impersonating a law enforcement officer.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump issued a series of pardons on Wednesday, awarding them to a former New York congressman, a Connecticut governor, a rapper known as ""NBA YoungBoy"", a labour union leader and a onetime Army officer who flaunted safety measures during the Coronavirus pandemic.His actions mixed Trump's willingness to pardon high-profile Republicans and other supporters, donors and friends with the influence of Alice Marie Johnson, whom Trump recently named his pardon czar after he offered a pardon to her in 2020.Johnson was convicted in 1996 on eight criminal counts related to a Memphis-based cocaine trafficking operation. Trump commuted her life sentence in 2018 at the urging of celebrity Kim Kardashian West, allowing for Johnson's early release.Johnson then served as the featured speaker on the final night of the 2020 Republican National Convention, and Trump subsequently pardoned her before more recently naming her as his point person for pardons.Among those receiving the latest round of Trump pardons was Louisiana rap artiste NBA YoungBoy, whose real name is Kentrell Gaulden and whose stage moniker stands for ""Never Broke Again"".In 2024, he was sentenced to just under two years in prison on gun-related charges after he acknowledged having possessed weapons despite being a convicted felon.Gaulden also pleaded guilty to his role in a prescription drug fraud ring in Utah.Gaulden's and the other pardons were confirmed Wednesday evening by two White House officials who spoke only on background to detail actions that had not yet been formally made public.In a statement posted online, Gaulden said, ""I want to thank President Trump for granting me a pardon and giving me the opportunity to keep building - as a man, as a father, and as an artiste.""He said this ""opens the door to a future I've worked hard for and I am fully prepared to step into this"", and thanked Johnson.Trump has spent the week issuing high-profile pardons.A video released by a White House aide showed Johnson in the Oval Office on Tuesday, as Trump called their daughter to say he was pardoning TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley of the reality show ""Chrisley Knows Best"".Their show spotlighted the family's extravagant lifestyle, but the couple was convicted of conspiring to defraud banks in the Atlanta area out of more than USD 30 million in loans by submitting false documents.Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, addressed the Republican convention last summer and had long said her parents were treated unfairly.Also Wednesday, Trump commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, a former Chicago gang leader serving a life sentence.Hoover was first imprisoned in connection with a murder in 1973, and was convicted of running a criminal enterprise in 1998, but later renounced his criminal past and petitioned for a reduced sentence.The president also pardoned James Callahan, a New York union leader who pleaded guilty to failing to report USD 315,000 in gifts from an advertising firm and was about to be sentenced.The president pardoned former Connecticut governor John Rowland, a Republican who served from 1995 to 2004 and was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison for charges related to concealing his involvement in two federal election campaigns.He further pardoned Michael Grimm, a New York Republican who resigned from Congress after being convicted of tax fraud.Grimm won reelection in 2014 despite being under indictment for underreporting wages and revenue at a restaurant that he ran.Grimm eventually resigned after pleading guilty and serving eight months in prison. Last year, Grimm was paralysed from the chest down when he was thrown off a horse during a polo tournament.Yet another Trump pardon was issued for Army Lt. Mark Bradshaw, who was convicted in 2022 of reporting to work without undergoing a Covid-19 test.","US President Donald Trump issued a series of pardons on Wednesday.

What Kamala Harris said at the real estate event







Sky News Australia tore into former vice president Kamala Harris for being the chief speaker at a real estate event in Gold Coast, where she was reported paid half a million dollars to ""essentially chuckle on stage and make jokes about being unemployed"". The former vice president was in Australia Sunday to speak at the Australian Real Estate Conference, where she sat on stage with real estate industry veteran John McGrath and spoke about her mother, Playboy Magazine covers, hormones and being unemployed right now.Sky News Digital Presenter Gabriella Power called Kamala Harris a comedian as she asked comedian and commentator Alex Stein to comment on Harris's Australia outing.“She can’t do any worse than spending $1 billion on her presidential campaign and somehow ending up $100 million in debt,” Stein said, adding that he double-checked whether Kamala Harris ever visited Australia when she was the vice president and the answer is no. ""I wonder why she's there now. I know why she's there now. She is there for the money,"" Stein said.“Kamala Harris is not having very good job prospects, or many offers here in America that are that great, so what is she going to do? She’s going to go to Australia,"" Stein said.""My mother was actually very funny because she would say, 'You look at the cover of Playboy magazine, let me just tell you, the reason that people are looking at these things, understand what they were developed for the perpetuation of the human species!' She was very practical that way,"" Kamala Harris said and began laughing.""I don't aspire to be humble. And I don't recommend it, I think that one must be humble. But to aspire to be humble would be quite inauthentic,"" she said on humility. ""If one understands that, just, I mean, there's so much that is magnificent and awe-inspiring about this world and its people.""When the moderator said he believed that Kamala Harris's best work is ahead of her, for sure, Harris said, ""I am unemployed right now.

Poll Do you think the CIF’s rule change will positively impact female athletes? Yes, it will create more opportunities No, it may cause challenges in competition





The California interscholastic federation (CIF) announced a rule change this week to allow more girls to participate in the upcoming state track-and-field championships following public backlash over the inclusion of a transgender athlete, reported AP.In a statement issued Tuesday, the CIF said it would implement a ""pilot entry process"" to extend entry to more “biological female” athletes. The new rule allows any athlete who missed the automatic qualifying mark but had the next-best result in their section final to compete at the state level.“The CIF believes this pilot entry process achieves the participation opportunities we seek to afford our student-athletes,” the organisation said.The change only applies to this weekend’s competition. The CIF did not say how many athletes would be affected or whether the rule applies to all events or only those where a transgender athlete has qualified for the final. This could be the first time a high school sports governing body in the US has expanded competition in response to the participation of a transgender athlete.The change was introduced after US President Trump criticised the participation of trans athlete AB Hernandez, a transgender athlete competing in girls track and field.Trump threatened Tuesday to pull federal funding from California if the state did not bar transgender students from competing in girls’ sports.“THIS IS NOT FAIR, AND TOTALLY DEMEANING TO WOMEN AND GIRLS,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.Hernandez is set to compete in the girls varsity triple jump, high jump, and long jump at the state finals. She won the Division 3 girls long jump and triple jump and placed seventh in the high jump at the Southern Section Division Finals on May 19.Parents and conservative advocates opposed to transgender girls competing in girls sports have criticized Hernandez and heckled her during postseason meets.After losing to Hernandez in the long jump at the sectional final, La Canada High School’s Katie McGuinness called on the CIF to revise its policy.California governor Gavin Newsom recently said on his podcast that it is “deeply unfair” for transgender girls to participate in girls sports.Last month, Democratic state lawmakers in California blocked bills that would have barred transgender girls from participating in girls sports.","The California interscholastic federation (CIF) announced a rule change this week to allow more girls to participate in the upcoming state track-and-field championships.

Trump Admin Orders Social Media Screening For All Visa Applicants With Gaza Connections





The United States has announced a new visa restriction policy targeting foreign nationals accused of infringing on the free speech rights of American citizens abroad.Announcing the move on Wednesday, secretary of state Marco Rubio said the policy will apply to foreign officials and individuals who are ""complicit in censoring Americans"", including those involved in fining, harassing, or criminally charging US citizens for expressing their views overseas.“For too long, Americans have been fined, harassed, and even charged by foreign authorities for exercising their free speech rights,” said Rubio in a post on X. “Free speech is essential to the American way of life – a birthright over which foreign governments have no authority,” Rubio wrote.While the state department did not name any specific countries or individuals who might be affected by the new policy, Rubio made it clear the administration is taking a harder line: “Foreigners who work to undermine the rights of Americans should not enjoy the privilege of traveling to our country,” he said.“Whether in Latin America, Europe, or elsewhere, the days of passive treatment for those who work to undermine the rights of Americans are over,” Rubio said.The state department has not yet detailed how the policy will be implemented or what evidence will be used to determine visa ineligibility.","The U.S. has announced a new visa restriction policy targeting foreign nationals accused of infringing on the free speech rights of American citizens abroad.
