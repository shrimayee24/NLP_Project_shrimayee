KOZHIKODE : Aranikkal Azeez walked into what was once a classroom at govt vocational higher secondary school in Meppadi - 16km from Mundakkai , a town uphill where a gushing wall of water, mud and stones buried all in its path early Monday. The room, typically filled with the chatter of students, had transformed into a temporary morgue. A line of freezers held the bodies of those claimed by the catastrophic landslide.Azeez's gaze fixed on the body of a woman inside one of these freezers.Overwhelmed with sorrow, he cried out: ""What misfortune. I can't identify my daughter. We cannot confirm we got her."" Relatives gently then led him out of the room, his steps unsteady.Outside, Azeez's head swooned, and he was helped to a bench in another building where he lay down, exhausted by the anguish. His brothers stood nearby and said they were 80% sure the body marked as number 75, found 25km away in Chaliyar river, was that of Azeez's daughter Shabna.Azeez doubted that Shabna and his other missing family members would have been washed all the way to Chaliyar. By Wednesday night, search teams had found 52 bodies from Chaliyar and as many as 84 body parts, making identification even more challenging. A body identified by one family was claimed by another, leading to its return to the freezer Wednesday. Azeez's distress was palpable, echoing the collective grief of a community in mourning in Kerala's Wayanad district.","Aranikkal Azeez's daughter Shabna was buried in a landslide in Kerala, India.

Other opposition MPs, too, raised the issue on social media and in Parliament.After the video quickly went viral, central public works department, which is under Union housing and urban affairs ministry as well as Lok Sabha secretariat, played down the issue, saying the leak was a result of extreme weather action and had been ""addressed"" immediately.The heat of an unprecedented summer followed by very intense rain eroded silicon from a glass joint on Lok Sabha lobby skylight, creating a small issue...

Olympic gender debate: Trump condemns trans inclusion as Harris campaign stays silent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/olympic-gender-debate-trump-condemns-trans-inclusion-as-harris-campaign-stays-silent/articleshow/112210733.cms,"As the 2024 Olympic Games stir debate on various fronts, a new controversy has emerged involving transgender athletes, igniting a fierce political and public debate in the US. The White House and Kamala Harris' campaign have remained silent on whether they support the inclusion of biologically male, intersex, or transgender athletes competing against biological females.The Trump campaign seized on the controversy, launching a robust critique of the current administration's policies. “President Trump has been unequivocally clear that he will NOT stand for men competing in women’s sports – an insane and unfair reality that has been allowed to transpire because of Radical Left politicians like Kamala Harris,” a Trump campaign spokesperson said as quoted by the Fox News. “When he returns to the White House, President Trump will take immediate action to protect women and girls and overturn the Harris-Biden Administration's radical rewrite of Title IX.”The debate intensified following the disqualification of Algerian boxer Imane Khelif from the 2023 World Boxing Championships. The International Boxing Association (IBA) ruled that Khelif, who is listed as female on her passport, failed gender tests, showing elevated testosterone levels. The decision followed a controversial match where Khelif's opponent, Italian boxer Angela Carini, withdrew just 46 seconds in due to the impact of Khelif’s punch.Carini expressed her frustration, saying, “I didn’t give up, but one punch hurt too much, and so I said enough. I’m going out with my head held high.”IBA President Umar Kremlev explained the disqualification, citing DNA tests that revealed XY chromosomes in some athletes, leading to their exclusion from the competition. This move has sparked a broader debate over gender eligibility in sports.The Algerian Olympic Committee (COA) defended Khelif, condemning what it called “unethical targeting and maligning” of the athlete. The COA called for an end to “baseless propaganda” and emphasized its commitment to protecting Khelif’s dignity and career.Italian sports minister Andrea Abodi echoed concerns about fairness in competition, noting the lack of uniform international criteria for gender eligibility. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni also weighed in, stating, “I think that athletes who have male genetic characteristics should not be admitted to women’s competitions… to protect the right of female athletes to be able to compete on equal terms.”The controversy is set against a backdrop of additional criticism faced by the Olympics, including backlash from Christian groups over the opening ceremonies, which featured skits deemed offensive by some.If elected, Kamala Harris is expected to advance the Biden administration's efforts to expand Title IX protections to include gender identity and sexual orientation, a move LGBTQ+ activists have supported as necessary to prevent discrimination. This rule took effect on August 1, adding to the ongoing debate over the role of gender in sports and beyond.","The Trump campaign seized on the controversy, launching a robust critique of the current administration's policies.

"Louisiana Laws: Louisiana's new laws: Surgical castration, 'don't say gay', absentee ballot restrictions, and more",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/louisianas-new-laws-surgical-castration-dont-say-gay-absentee-ballot-restrictions-and-more/articleshow/112210198.cms,"Surgical castration as punishment

Restrictions on

absentee ballots

Previously Vetoed Anti-LGBTQ Measures

Police 'buffer-zone'

Concealed carry of firearms

A series of new laws in Louisiana , including a groundbreaking measure that allows judges to impose surgical castration on offenders convicted of certain sex crimes against children, took effect on Thursday. These laws reflect a shift towards conservative policies under the new Republican governor Jeff Landry and a GOP supermajority in the state legislature, according to AP.Louisiana has joined a few other states such as California, Florida, and Texas, which have allowed chemical castration for over 15 years.However, it is now the first state to permit judges to sentence offenders to surgical castration for specific aggravated sex crimes against children under 13. This punishment is discretionary and not automatic.Chemical castration uses medications to reduce testosterone production and decrease sex drive, while surgical castration involves the removal of testicles or ovaries, a far more invasive procedure. This method is used in countries known for severe criminal sanctions, like the Czech Republic and Nigeria. Supporters of the law, including Democratic senator Regina Barrow who authored it, hope it will deter crimes against children. However, opponents argue it is a form of cruel and unusual punishment.Louisiana currently has 2,224 inmates serving sentences for such crimes, but the new law applies only to those convicted after August 1.New restrictions on absentee ballots have been introduced in Louisiana, a state where mail-in voting has gained popularity. The new legislation limits how many times a person can assist with filling out, signing as a witness, and delivering absentee ballots. Additionally, it makes it easier for officials to reject absentee ballots missing certain details.Supporters, including the state’s top election official, believe these measures will protect election integrity. Critics argue the laws could create additional hurdles for voters, particularly elderly residents who rely on help from family, neighbours, or caretakers during elections.Under the new administration of governor Jeff Landry, previously vetoed bills targeting transgender youth have become law. One new law prohibits teachers from discussing gender identity and sexual orientation in schools, a policy critics refer to as “don’t say gay.” It also bans covering these topics during any extracurricular activities under school jurisdiction.A new law now imposes penalties on anyone who knowingly approaches within 25 feet (7.6 meters) of a police officer performing their official duties, after being ordered to stop or retreat. Violators can face up to a $500 fine, up to 60 days in jail, or both.Critics, including the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, argue that the law could impede the public’s ability to film police and infringe on First Amendment rights . Proponents believe the law will create a buffer zone ensuring officer safety, while still allowing bystanders to film police interactions from a reasonable distance.A Republican-drafted law allowing individuals aged 18 and older to carry a concealed weapon without a permit went into effect across Louisiana on July 4. However, in New Orleans, this legislation became effective on Thursday when a more restrictive city ordinance expired.“The city is no longer allowed to have stricter laws than the state regarding permitless concealed carrying of a firearm ,” said Reese Harper, communications director for the New Orleans police department, as per AP.Supporters argue that expanding gun rights strengthens the constitutional right to carry firearms. Opponents fear that the lack of required training for carrying a concealed weapon could lead to increased gun violence. According to the National Council of State Legislatures, Louisiana is now the 28th state to implement such legislation.","Louisiana is the first state to permit judges to sentence offenders to surgical castration for specific aggravated sex crimes against children under 13.

US & Russia complete biggest prisoner swap since Cold War,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-russia-complete-biggest-prisoner-swap-since-cold-war/articleshow/112210269.cms,"A prisoner swap on Thursday involving seven countries freed the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and two other Americans held in Russia, along with several jailed Russian opposition figures, the White House said, in the most far-reaching exchange between Russia and the West in decades.The scope of the deal has little precedent in the post-Soviet era.For the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union, Moscow freed prominent dissidents as part of a swap; 16 people in total were released from Russian custody. In exchange, eight people were freed by the West, after a complex web of negotiations that took place behind the scenes for months among nations that are otherwise bitterly at odds over Russian aggression in Ukraine.The exchange took place at the international airport in Ankara, Turkiye's capital, and involved seven different planes ferrying 24 prisoners from the US, Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway, Russia and Belarus, a Turkish intelligence official said. The deal seemed sure to prompt jubilation among Western nations that had condemned the charges against the imprisoned Americans and opposition figures as baseless and politically motivated. It also delivered a diplomatic victory for Prez Biden , who has long pledged to bring home imprisoned Americans and to support Russia's embattled pro-democracy movement. Biden said at a news conference that the prisoners had left Russia and were on their way home. ""Their brutal ordeal is over, and they're free,"" he said, surrounded by family members of the released prisoners.It was also a triumph of a different sort for Prez Putin of Russia, who can use the deal to highlight his loyalty to Russian agents who get arrested abroad. But the deal also carried risks at home for him, by releasing imprisoned politicians who could energize Russia's moribund, exiled opposition.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did not specifically confirm a swap but was quoted by the state news agency TASS as saying that, in principle, ""all our enemies should stay there (abroad), and all those who are not our enemies should return"".In the last major exchange in 2010, 14 prisoners were exchanged. In Dec 2022, Russia traded US basketball star Brittney Griner, sentenced to nine years for having vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage, for arms dealer Viktor Bout, serving a 25-year sentence in the US.","The scope of the deal has little precedent in the post-Soviet era. 16 people in total were released from Russian custody.

What lies behind Donald Trump’s claims about Kamala Harris 'turning black' for political advantage?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-lies-behind-donald-trumps-claims-about-kamala-harris-turning-black-for-political-advantage/articleshow/112209926.cms,"The Truths We Hold

The Breakfast Club

Former President Donald Trump has intensified his attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris , claiming she ""happened to turn Black"" for political advantage. This incendiary remark is the latest in a series of racially charged statements from Trump, aimed at undermining his 2024 rival. However, Harris's embrace of her racial identity and heritage has been a core aspect of her life long before she entered the political arena.Harris, born in Oakland, California, in 1964, is the daughter of Afro-Jamaican Donald Harris and Shyamala Gopalan, who emigrated from India. The couple met at the University of California, Berkeley, where they engaged in civil rights activism, often with young Kamala in tow. Donald Harris, now a professor emeritus at Stanford University, and Gopalan, who passed away in 2009 after making significant contributions to breast cancer research, raised their daughters with a strong sense of cultural pride.Following their divorce, Gopalan continued to emphasize both her daughters' South Asian heritage and their Black identity. In her 2019 memoir,, Harris recounts how her mother, aware of societal perceptions, was determined that her daughters would grow up as confident Black women. Gopalan's efforts included trips to India and the use of Tamil in their household, ensuring that both Kamala and her younger sister Maya understood and appreciated their diverse backgrounds.As a child, Harris attended a newly desegregated school in a predominantly white neighborhood and was actively involved in her local Black church. Her statement onin 2019, ""I'm Black, and I'm proud of being Black, and I was born Black, I will die Black,"" reflects her long-standing commitment to her racial identity.Harris's educational choices further underscore her dedication to her Black heritage . She attended Howard University, a historically Black institution, and joined Alpha Kappa Alpha, the sorority founded to support Black women. Her activism included participating in protests against apartheid in South Africa.After Howard, Harris continued to align herself with her Black identity during her legal career. As president of the Black Law Students Association at UC Hastings College of the Law and later as San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general, Harris was consistently recognized in the media as a Black or African American leader.Trump’s attacks, drawing comparisons to criticisms faced by Barack Obama, are seen by some analysts as a strategy to undermine Harris’s credibility. Christopher Clark, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, suggests that Trump's remarks are a form of "" race-baiting "" intended to rally his base.Teresa Wiltz, writing for Politico, argues that American Black identity encompasses a wide range of experiences and appearances due to the legacy of slavery. She emphasizes that significant Black figures in history, such as Frederick Douglass and Angela Davis, were also of mixed race, and Harris’s self-identification as Black should be respected.Harris’s public life has always included a strong affirmation of her racial identity, from her activism and career choices to her personal declarations. Trump’s recent comments seem to overlook the complexities of racial identity in favor of a divisive and misleading narrative.","Kamala Harris is the daughter of Afro-Jamaican Donald Harris and Shyamala Gopalan, who emigrated from India.

But you know what, I respect either one, but she obviously doesn't, because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden she made a turn, and she went - she became a Black person,"" he continued.Harris, who has identified as both Black and South Asian American, is the first Black and Asian American US vice president.White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre responded to Trump's remarks, saying, ""What he just said is repulsive. It's insulting.""Since starting her campaign, Harris has encountered repeated sexist and racist attacks online. Despite this, she continues to identify as both Black and South Asian American. Trump’s comments have also fueled further misinformation spread by far-right and conservative accounts on social media, questioning Harris' racial identity.The panel interview had a tense beginning when ABC News reporter Rachel Scott asked Trump why Black voters should support him despite his controversial history with racially charged comments. Trump reacted strongly to the question, calling it ""horrible,"" ""hostile,"" and a ""disgrace,"" while also labeling ABC as a ""fake"" network.""I have been the best president for the Black population since Abraham Lincoln,"" Trump asserted.Trump's appearance at the convention, his first-ever at the National Association of Black Journalists' annual event in Chicago, faced backlash from some members. This prompted a co-chair of the convention to resign in protest.Despite this friction, Trump has made some progress with Black men, particularly after President Joe Biden , his former Democratic opponent, struggled to mobilize Black voters, who have traditionally been a loyal Democratic voting bloc. In 2020, Biden secured 92% of Black voters compared to Trump’s 8%, according to Pew Research.The race for the presidency is anticipated to be tight, with key battleground states playing a decisive role. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, Trump leads Harris by a narrow margin of 43%-42%, within the poll's margin of error. This survey is among several recent polls indicating that Harris has closed the gap that Trump had widened in the final weeks of Biden's campaign.","Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump questioned the racial identity of his Democratic rival Kamala Harris during an appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists' annual convention.

"Who is Khaled Meshaal, tipped to be next Hamas chief ?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/who-is-khaled-meshaal-tipped-to-be-next-hamas-chief-/articleshow/112182356.cms,"What we know about Khaled Meshaal

Khaled Meshaal, who is expected to become the new leader of Hamas, gained global attention in 1997 when Israeli agents attempted to assassinate him by injecting him with poison outside his office in Amman, Jordan.

Originally from Silwad near Ramallah, Meshaal moved to Kuwait with his family as a child and joined the Muslim Brotherhood at age 15. The Brotherhood played a key role in founding Hamas during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the late 1980s.

Meshaal transitioned from being a schoolteacher to lobbying for Hamas from abroad, while other Hamas leaders were often imprisoned by Israel.

As Hamas' political leader in exile since the year before the assassination attempt, Meshaal has represented the group internationally, benefiting from fewer travel restrictions compared to other Hamas officials.

At 68, Meshaal is tipped to succeed Ismail Haniyeh, who was recently assassinated in Iran, with both Tehran and Hamas pledging retaliation against Israel. Meshaal's relationship with Iran has been complicated due to his previous support for the Sunni revolt against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2011.

Throughout his tenure, Meshaal has faced the challenge of balancing the group's original goal of Israel's destruction with the possibility of a more pragmatic approach to achieve Palestinian statehood. His efforts to reconcile with President Mahmoud Abbas led to internal tensions within Hamas, resulting in his replacement by Haniyeh in 2017.

When Khaled Meshaal was responsible for international fundraising in Jordan, he narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. The incident in 1997, ordered by then-Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in retaliation for a Hamas bombing in Jerusalem, aimed to kill Meshaal.

After the assassination attempt, Jordan closed Hamas' office in Amman and expelled Meshaal, who then moved to Qatar and later to Syria in 2001. In December 2012, Meshaal visited the Gaza Strip for the first time since leaving the West Bank as a child and delivered a significant speech at Hamas' 25th anniversary celebration.

During his time abroad, Hamas solidified its control over Gaza in 2007, challenging the Western-backed Palestinian Authority that was open to peace negotiations with Israel.

Khaled Meshaal is tipped off as the new leader of Hamas after the ‘ assassination ’ of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. The strike, which Hamas has blamed on Israel , has left the group scrambling to find a new leader while raising concerns about the direction the group will take amid ongoing conflict .( with input from agencies)","Khaled Meshaal, 68, is tipped to succeed Ismail Haniyeh as Hamas leader.

Originally knowns as Mohammad Masri, the Hamas commander was born in 1965 in the Khan Yunis Refugee Camp

Later became known as Mohammed Deif after joining Hamas during the first Intifada in 1987.

Deif was arrested in 1989 and detained for about 16 months, later earned a science degree from the Islamic University in Gaza, where he also engaged in the arts.

He rose through the ranks of Hamas, developing its tunnel network and bomb-making skills, and has been a major target for Israeli forces, responsible for numerous Israeli deaths in suicide bombings.

'See my assessment below on the 13 Keys Tracker on where The Keys stand NOW.'Harris filed her nomination on July 27 officially and declared her candidature for President race.Harris has an upper hand in this election because of the several key factors like she faced no primary challenger, there has been minimal threat from third-party candidates, and the economy remains strong both in the short and long term.With the transition from Biden to Harris, the White House has avoided major policy changes, and Harris is not contending with any scandals or significant social unrest.Lichtman observed that with Biden’s shift to Harris as the presumptive nominee, the Democrats have lost the incumbency advantage. As Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump prepare to face off, Lichtman considers the race essentially open, reported The Daily Mail.However, Lichtman also pointed out that the Democrats have managed to mitigate potential fallout from this transition.

US-Russia: From journalists to high-profile convicts: US and Russia complete largest post-Soviet prisoner swap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-and-russia-complete-largest-post-soviet-prisoner-swap/articleshow/112209789.cms,"The United States and Russia completed their largest post-Soviet prisoner swap on Thursday, involving 24 individuals. According to AP, this complex exchange followed months of negotiations and necessitated concessions from European countries holding Russian prisoners.The swap saw the release of a diverse group, including journalists, political dissidents, suspected spies, a hacker, a fraudster, and even a convicted murderer.Among those freed by Russia were Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, a corporate security executive from Michigan, both accused of espionage charges that the US government deemed baseless. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty journalist Alsu Kurmasheva and Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was serving a 25-year sentence for treason, were also released.The most infamous of the eight individuals Russia received was Vadim Krasikov, convicted in Germany in 2021 for the murder of a former Chechen rebel in Berlin, allegedly under orders from Moscow’s security services. The exchange also included two alleged “sleeper” agents jailed in Slovenia, three men charged in the US, and two others returned from Norway and Poland.This substantial exchange does not signify a betterment in US-Russia relations. Previous swaps, including the December 2022 exchange of WNBA star Brittney Griner for arms trafficker Viktor Bout, have not led to improved relations. The backdrop of ongoing Russian aggression in Ukraine and continuous US military support for Kyiv underscores the persistent hostilities.Despite the scale of the swap, several Americans remain detained in Russia. This group includes Travis Leake, a musician convicted on drug charges; Gordon Black, an American soldier convicted of theft and threats of murder; Marc Fogel, a teacher also convicted on drug charges; and Ksenia Khavana, arrested for treason charges linked to collecting money for Ukraine’s military.Fogel's family expressed frustration over his exclusion from the swap, deeming it “inconceivable” and urging the Biden administration to prioritise his release. A senior administration official acknowledged the ongoing efforts to secure the release of the remaining detainees.The US and its allies have released individuals convicted of serious crimes, including Krasikov, whose actions were tied to the Russian authorities. Krasikov’s 2019 murder of Zelimkhan “Tornike” Khangoshvili, a Georgian citizen and former Chechen rebel, was conducted under a false identity provided by Russian officials. Throughout negotiations, Russia prioritised Krasikov’s release, with President Vladimir Putin hinting at the possibility earlier this year.In contrast, the Americans and Europeans released by Russia were predominantly held on charges considered baseless. President Joe Biden acknowledged the tough decisions involved in such deals but emphasised the importance of protecting Americans.A notable absentee from the swap was Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Discussions had included a potential exchange involving Navalny and Krasikov, but Navalny’s sudden and unexplained death in February thwarted these plans. Nevertheless, several of Navalny’s associates were released.Politically, this swap was a significant move for President Biden, who had foreshadowed his commitment to securing the release of unjustly detained Americans. Welcoming the families of the returning Americans to the White House, Biden highlighted the importance of international alliances, subtly contrasting this with former President Donald Trump ’s “America First” approach.

Trump turns 2024 presidential race into debate on Harris’ race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-turns-2024-presidential-race-into-debate-on-harris-race-is-this-worrying-some-republicans/articleshow/112209454.cms,"Trump doubles down on his comments

'This could backfire'

As the 2024 presidential race heats up, Donald Trump has once again stirred controversy with remarks questioning Vice President Kamala Harris ' racial identity . His comments, suggesting that Harris ""turned Black"" for political gain, have drawn sharp criticism from Democrats and even sparked discomfort within his own party.Trump’s racially charged rhetoric has been a hallmark of his political strategy, dating back to his role in the “birther” movement against Barack Obama.However, this latest attack on Harris, who is of Jamaican and Indian descent, appears to be testing the limits of his allies' patience. Some Republicans, including Sen. Cynthia Lummis, have publicly distanced themselves from the former president’s remarks, warning that such rhetoric is unhelpful and divisive.Despite the internal pushback, Trump has shown no signs of retreating. He doubled down on his comments, sharing a photo of Harris in traditional Indian attire on social media, further questioning her racial identity. This move seems to contradict advice from within his own campaign, where advisers believe focusing on Harris' policies rather than her identity would be more effective.The controversy comes at a pivotal moment in the election cycle, with President Joe Biden having recently ended his re-election bid and endorsed Harris. Trump, who has had to shift his campaign strategy from attacking an aging Biden to facing a younger and more dynamic Harris, appears to be leaning heavily on his familiar playbook of racial division.While some within the GOP believe that race-based attacks could backfire, particularly among swing voters, others see potential gains in targeting Harris’ identity to appeal to certain segments of the electorate. Diante Johnson, president of the Black Conservative Federation, argues that Trump’s broader focus on economic and social policies might resonate with Black voters, though this strategy is not without risks.Pollster Frank Luntz notes that gender-based criticisms of Harris might hold some sway, but race-based attacks are likely to be less effective. He warns that such tactics could alienate crucial voters, especially in a race where Trump’s handling of race has been under intense scrutiny.As the campaign unfolds, Trump’s approach to Harris will likely continue to evolve, shaped by both his instincts and the feedback from within his party. For now, his strategy of questioning Harris’ racial identity reflects a familiar, if controversial, path — one that has defined much of his political career. Whether it will pay off in November remains to be seen.","Trump's racially charged rhetoric has been a hallmark of his political strategy, dating back to his role in the 'birther' movement against Barack Obama.

And unfortunately, he died,” said Sullivan. ""In fact, on the very day that he died, I saw Evan's parents. And I told them that the president was determined to get this done in light of that tragic news.""Navalny, a prominent political opponent of Russian leader Vladimir Putin , was found dead in a Russian prison in Western Siberia in February at the age of 47. President Biden and many Western officials held Putin responsible for Navalny's death, given the Russian leader's history of seeing his enemies die under suspicious circumstances. Navalny had previously fallen ill due to alleged poisoning in 2020 and was later imprisoned on charges of embezzlement, extremism, and more, which Western leaders denounced as politically motivated.The prisoner swap deal, hailed by Biden as a ""feat of diplomacy,"" involved six countries and two dozen prisoners. In exchange for the three Americans, Russia secured the return of eight nationals, including three from US prisons, two from Slovenia, one from Norway, one from Poland, and Vadim Krasikov from Germany. Krasikov, a convicted murderer facing life in prison for allegedly killing a Georgian asylum seeker who had fought against Kremlin forces in Chechnya, was a key figure in the negotiations, with Putin expressing his desire for Krasikov's release during an interview with Tucker Carlson in February.The complex prisoner exchange, described as one of the largest since the end of the Cold War, involved high-level discussions between the US and Germany, with both President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Sullivan acknowledged the difficult decision to release a convicted criminal to secure the freedom of an innocent American, stating, ""And yet, sometimes the choice is between doing that and consigning that person basically to live out their days in prison in a hostile foreign country.""","US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan confirmed that the US had been working with partners on a deal that would have included Alexei Navalny.

Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich walked free Thursday as part of the largest East-West prisoner swap since the Cold War -- in what could be seen as a big victory of the Joe Biden administration. Joe Biden said the prisoner swap is a powerful example of why it's vital to have friends in this world -- as he credited the allies for the multi-country swap deal that set two dozen people free.The countries involved in the swap deal were US, Russia, Belarus and Germany. Norway, Slovenia, Poland became part of the deal as they has custody of additional Russians included in the exchange, Turkey provided critical logistic support in the deal.Evan Gershkovich was arrested on charges of espionage that both the US government and the Wall Street Journal denied but Kremlin insisted that he was caught spying red-handed.The Wall Street Journal published a detailed account of what went behind all these months Geshkovich was inside a jail in Russia culminating on Thursday when Evan's monther Ella arrived for an urgent 10.30am meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House. Today was the 491st day of her son's detention and she was asked to bring her husband and her daughter. The only instruction was: Tell no one.WSJ reported that Evan Gerskovich had to put in an official request for presidential clemency address to Putin. He added a request if after his release he would be allowed to take an interview of Putin. ""The pro forma printout included a long blank space the prisoner could fill out if desired, or simply, as expected, leave blank. In the formal high Russian he had honed over 16 months imprisonment, the Journal’s Russia correspondent filled the page. The last line submitted a proposal of his own: After his release, would Putin be willing to sit down for an interview?"" the WSJ report said.Former US president Donald Trump who recently said Putin would free Gerskovich only for Trump after he becomes the president questioned that deal that got the WSJ journalist freed. He pressed for details of the prisoner swap and asked whether Russia was also paid in cash.""So when are they going to release the details of the prisoner swap with Russia? How many people do we get versus them? Are we also paying them cash? Are they giving us cash (Please withdraw that question, because I’m sure the answer is NO)? Are we releasing murderers, killers, or thugs? Just curious because we never make good deals, at anything, but especially hostage swaps. Our “negotiators” are always an embarrassment to us! I got back many hostages, and gave the opposing Country NOTHING – and never any cash. To do so is bad precedent for the future. That’s the way it should be, or this situation will get worse and worse. They are extorting the United States of America. They’re calling the trade “complex” – That’s so nobody can figure out how bad it is!""

Bilawal Bhutto Zardari's party says ready to talk with Imran Khan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/bilawal-bhutto-zardaris-party-says-ready-to-talk-with-imran-khan/articleshow/112084489.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Peoples Party-led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has said that it is ready to talk with jailed former prime minister Imran Khan if the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder is willing to engage, amidst heightened political instability in the cash-strapped country. ""It is being said that the PTI founder is ready to talk. If Imran Khan is ready to talk then that's a positive thing,"" Senior PPP leader Khurshid Shah said while speaking to the media in Quetta, the provincial capital of Balochistan.Shah welcomed the possibility of talks as a positive development.""President Asif Ali Zardari has always tried to solve problems through negotiations, and the PPP would play its role if needed,"" Shah was quoted as saying by the Express Tribune newspaper.The PPP's willingness to engage with Khan's party comes amidst heightened political instability, following the PTI's hard-line stance against the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) led government.The PPP, along with the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and other allies, supports the PML-N of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The two former rivals recently witnessed a war of words. The ruling PML-N accepted all the demands of PPP over the federal budget and allocation of development funds.Since Khan's ouster through a vote of no confidence in 2022, the PTI has maintained a strong opposition to the PPP-PML-N alliance.Political tensions increased after the February 8 elections, which saw the two parties forming a coalition government in the Centre.Calls for reconciliation have been growing from various societal and political quarters, urging the PTI to negotiate with the government.Khan's party had previously rejected talks with what it termed the ""Form-47 government,"" instead showing a preference for dialogue with the military establishment.In April, PTI's Shehryar Afridi indicated a preference for negotiations with Army chief Gen Asim Munir and the Director General of Inter-Services Intelligence (DG ISI).Subsequently, PTI Secretary General Omar Ayub mentioned that Imran Khan had assigned significant responsibility to former President Dr Arif Alvi.Last month, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar confirmed that Khan had approved discussions with the government.Similarly, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Khan's sister Aleema Khan called for state institutions to remain neutral for the country's progress.Meanwhile, the government too has called on the Khan-founded party to come to the table and hold talks.""If you want to remove us then do it. You don't want to resolve issues but to further complicate them. You should do talks instead of destroying everything,"" Federal Minister for Petroleum Dr Musadik Malik said last week.",The Pakistan Peoples Party-led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has said that it is ready to talk with jailed former prime minister Imran Khan. The PPP's willingness to engage with Khan's party comes amidst heightened political instability.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112084547,imgsize-68912,width-400,resizemode-4/112084547.jpg"
