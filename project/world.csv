We are now fighting BJP, RSS and the Indian state itself,"" he said.Gandhi said RSS-BJP want ""India to be run by a shady, hidden, secret society"", adding that Congress, with Shiva, Guru Nanak, Kabir and others as symbols, is in a ""civilizational war"" with the RSS ideology. He underlined that only Congress has the courage and the capability to fight RSS.

To say that India did not get true independence in 1947 is an insult to our freedom fighters, every single Indian citizen and an attack on our Constitution... and it is time we stopped listening to this nonsense that these people think they can keep parroting out, shouting and screaming.""He added, ""Bhagwat has the audacity to inform the nation every two to three days about what he thinks of the freedom movement, about the Constitution.""As he drew the Congress roots to the freedom movement and painted the RSS-BJP as those ""who don't salute the tricolor or respect the Constitution"", the Gandhi scion said it was ""symbolic"" that Bhagwat's statement was made on the eve of the unveiling of the Congress office which is ""not an ordinary building"" but has ""emerged from the soil of our country and as a result of the sacrifice of millions of people"".

The court asserted that if bail was granted, it can also be cancelled. Chemmanur tendered an unconditional apology , thereby averting further action by the court.Chemmanur had been granted bail on Tuesday in a sexual harassment case registered by the Ernakulam Central police based on a complaint from an actor. However, he chose to stay in jail, citing solidarity with prisoners who, despite being granted bail, were unable to secure their release due to financial constraints . Upon learning of his protest, Justice P V Kunhikrishnan directed both the prosecutor and Chemmanur's counsel to appear before the court on Wednesday morning, listing the matter as the first item.The prosecutor informed HC that jail authorities had waited until 7pm on Tuesday with the release order, but Chemmanur refused to leave. The bench sternly warned Chemmanur against playing any 'drama' with the court, emphasizing that it had the authority to cancel his bail if necessary. The court noted that the bail order had been uploaded at 4.08pm on Tuesday and that the principal district judge had issued the release order by 4.45pm.""Chemmanur need not act as the representative of remanded prisoners. The high court and the judicial system are here to protect their interests,"" the court said. The court criticised his actions as a media stunt. It warned that if Chemmanur did not leave jail by noon, his bail would be cancelled and police would be directed to complete the probe within two weeks, requiring Chemmanur to face trial within a month.Realising that the HC meant business, Chemmanur completed the necessary formalities and exited the jail on Wednesday morning. During the noon hearing, Chemmanur's counsel tendered an apology to the court. The court asked the counsel to clarify whether Chemmanur had made statements to the media claiming his decision to remain in jail was to help other prisoners. The court sought a response by 1.45pm. In the post-lunch session, Chemmanur's counsel explained that the alleged comments were a slip of the tongue and tendered an unconditional apology. The counsel also informed HC that the release order had only reached the jail on Wednesday morning. The court concluded the matter with a sarcastic remark, suggesting that Chemmanur was treated as though he had won an Olympic gold medal while walking out of jail.Meanwhile, prison sources said Chemmanur's legal team did not come on Tuesday with bail documents. ""His team came today and all procedures were completed in 15 minutes. Only 10 prisoners are still here despite getting bail.

Israel-Hamas deal: What happens now?

As Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire deal in a landmark development in the ongoing 15-month devasting war in the Gaza strip, Republicans started thanking incoming president Donald Trump for the major breakthrough. However, Trump is yet to take over the office and the deal came after weeks of painstaking negotiations in Doha between the two sides. When Biden was asked who should get the credit, he asked 'Is it a joke?' Biden however mentioned that he and Donald Trump are on the same page on this deal.But Donald Trump took credit for the deal as he wrote on Truth Social that it could have only happened because of his victory in November. How? Trump said his victory signaled to the world that he would not put up with anything but peace. ""This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies. I am thrilled American and Israeli hostages will be returning home to be reunited with their families and loved ones,"" Trump said taking credit.Trump's incoming national security adviser, Rep. Mike Waltz, in his own posting on X also credited Trump calling the development, “The Trump Effect.”Joe Biden in his final foreign policy speech as the president said discussion on the proposal that he laid out in detail months ago was coming to fruition.Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border attack, which killed some 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel responded with a fierce offensive that has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza’s population and sparked a humanitarian crisis.More than 100 hostages were freed from Gaza in a weeklong truce in November 2023.The ceasefire agreement, if approved by the Israeli cabinet, will end a protracted process in which multiple ceasefire proposals collapsed following last-minute demands from both sides.The full details of the deal are yet to be revealed but according to some key points released, Israel and Hamas have agreed to a six-week ceasefire which is seen as an initial phase to stop the fighting. During this phase, Israeli forces will withdraw from central Gaza, allowing the return of displaced Palestinians to the northern part of the enclave. Hamas will also release 33 Israeli hostages, including all women, children, and men over 50, during this initial phase.",Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire deal in a landmark development in the ongoing 15-month devasting war in the Gaza strip.

Here are some conspiracy theories that are running wild on the internet:

Wildfire Destroys Diddy's 'Freak-Off' Mansion? Internet Alleges Key Proof Lost

Fire to cover up crimes of Sean Diddy Combs?

Hollywood sign on fire

Fact or Fiction: Hollywood sign catches fire amid LA blazes?

Women's handbags used to fight the blaze

Governor clearing land to build apartments

Firefighters turned away due to safety issues in fire equipment?

Cause of fire- Arson or directed energy weapons

'Government plot'



Woke politics hampered rescue and relief, claim MAGAs

As the California wildfires continue to devastate the region, a wave of conspiracy theories has emerged, sparking widespread debates and confusion.From claims linking the fires to cover-ups involving Sean ""Diddy"" Combs to accusations of government plots and mismanagement, these unverified rumors are gaining traction online. While experts emphasize environmental factors like climate change and infrastructure issues as the primary causes, the wild theories are adding to the chaos surrounding the disaster.One wild theory linked the fires to Sean ""Diddy"" Combs. Rumors suggested that the fires were deliberately set to destroy evidence connected to allegations of abuse and misconduct tied to Diddy’s infamous parties.Diddy has faced over 100 allegations of sexual misconduct, including accusations of rape and child abuse, allegedly occurring at drug-fueled gatherings at his Los Angeles estate. Some claim a “Diddy list” exists, naming high-profile celebrities who attended these parties. While the list remains unverified, its rumored existence has fueled speculation.Adding to the intrigue are bizarre claims of secret tunnels connecting Diddy’s Holmby Hills mansion to other properties, including the Playboy Mansion and Michael Jackson’s former home. Online chatter suggests these tunnels could have been used for illicit activities, though no evidence supports their existence. Some dismiss the idea as an exaggerated online joke.Former US government official Catherine Austin Fitts stoked the fire, questioning how many of those spared by the wildfires were connected to Diddy.Despite the rumors, there is no official evidence connecting Diddy to the wildfires or confirming the existence of the alleged tunnels or list.Some people claimed that the iconic Hollywood sign in LA and shared footages of the flames engulfing the sign. However, wit was later confirmed that the viral videos were AI-genrated with one even having the Hollywood sigh with 3 Ls. Also ,Jeff Zarrinnam, who serves as the chairman of the Hollywood Sign Trust, has verified that the iconic landmark remains undamaged and in its proper position, according ti LA Times.A viral video during the California wildfires led to widespread misinformation about firefighters using women's handbags to combat the blazes. However, a Los Angeles Fire Department representative quoted by CBS News clarified that the footage showed personnel utilising standard-issue canvas bags, which are routinely employed to control minor fire outbreaks.A misleading social media post on X spread unfounded allegations about Governor Newsom collaborating with developers to alter zoning regulations in Pacific Palisades' burnt areas. Newsom directly refuted this claim stating, ""This is not true.""The unsubstantiated rumour suggested that the governor was coordinating efforts to modify zoning classifications in Pacific Palisades, specifically changing single-family residential zones (R1) to multi-unit residential zones (R3) to facilitate apartment construction.Theories circulated claiming that Oregon firefighters were turned away from assisting in the L.A. firefight because their equipment failed emission tests. However, these claims were quickly disproved. Oregon firefighters actively joined the firefighting efforts. LA County fire chief Anthony Marrone addressed the rumors during a Monday news conference, stating, “The LA County Fire Department has never turned down any offers for mutual aid assistance and resources,"" adding that the equipments passed all safety check.Several people including celebrities have alleged that the recent fires in Los Angeles could be the result of arson. Actor Henry Winkler expressed his anger on X, writing, ""May you be beaten you unrecognizable!!! The pain you have caused!!!"" Meanwhile, singer Chris Brown questioned the situation, saying, ""Someone starting these fires. S— don’t add up"" TV personality Peta Murgatroyd shared a warning about men in ski masks allegedly setting fires, and Elizabeth Chambers reposted claims that the fires seemed suspicious. Podcaster Andrew Huberman also shared a video, alleging that people were lighting fires in non-burning areas of the city. Despite these claims, the Los Angeles Police Department has stated that they have not received any reports of arson.Meanwhile, a Facebook post last week claimed that directed energy weapons (DEWs) caused the wildfires in Los Angeles in 2025, referencing a McDonald's restaurant burning down in a wooded area. The image shown was actually from the 2018 Camp Fire in Northern California, not the 2025 fires in Los Angeles.According to the US Government Accountability Office, concentrated electromagnetic energy forms the basis of directed energy weapons, which are designed to cause damage or destruction to adversary targets. In recent years, numerous social media posts have incorrectly associated these weapons with significant fire incidents, despite no evidence supporting such claims.Some other theorists alleged how numerous palm trees remained intact while surrounding vehicles and residences were destroyed, using this observation to bolster their unfounded claims of ""DEW attacks"". ""Cars and homes are burned but trees are still standing,"" wrote a social media commenter, insinuating that a deliberate assault had specifically aimed at destroying personal property.Accusations emerged from conspiracy theorists who alleged government involvement in starting the Los Angeles fires. These claims extended to assertions that authorities possessed weather manipulation capabilities, supposedly using them to intensify winds and expand the fire's reach.Alex Jones, the discredited conspiracy theorist, posted on X suggesting that the fires were ""part of a larger globalist plot to wage economic warfare and deindustrialize the United States before trigger total collapse."" Musk endorsed this unfounded assertion by responding with ""True"" to Jones's post.MAGA supporters, including Elon Musk, have blamed California’s diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies for the wildfires. They argue that DEI initiatives, which prioritize diversity over qualifications, have weakened essential services like the fire department and misallocated resources. Critics say that funds spent on social programs have taken away from disaster preparedness, creating a situation where identity politics takes precedence over public safety.However, many experts disagree with this argument, pointing out that DEI hiring policies don’t compromise qualifications for critical roles. They argue that the wildfires are caused by environmental factors such as climate change, droughts, and poor infrastructure, not by diversity policies. California’s history of fire management issues, outdated infrastructure, and inadequate disaster planning are also bigger contributors to the crisis.","Theories linking the fires to cover-ups involving Sean ""Diddy"" Combs are gaining traction online.

Implications of the deal

Qatar, Egypt and the United States announced on Wednesday that Israel and Hamas have reached a ceasefire and hostage release agreement, marking a potential turning point in one of the most devastating conflicts between the two sides.Set to take effect on January 19, the deal outlines a three-stage process aimed at achieving a ""sustainable calm."" The framework includes the release of hostages and prisoners, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from populated areas, and the resumption of humanitarian aid operations.If implemented, this agreement could end the bloodiest chapter in Israel-Hamas relations, although it leaves the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict unresolved.The following are the detailed components of the ceasefire arrangement:The first stage involves a temporary cessation of military operations between Israel and Hamas. Hamas will release 33 women and children hostages, along with hostages over 50 years old. Israel will free 30 Palestinian women and children for each Israeli hostage returned, CBS news reported.Additionally, Palestinian prisoners aged 50 or older will be released. Israeli forces will withdraw from populated areas in Gaza, and military air operations will pause for 10 hours daily, extending to 12 hours during prisoner exchanges. Large-scale aid, including food, fuel, and medical supplies, will be allowed into Gaza.In the second stage, both sides will declare a halt to all military operations. According to Arab Center Washington DC, all remaining male Israeli hostages, including civilians and soldiers, will be released in exchange for Palestinian detainees. Israeli forces will fully withdraw from Gaza.The third stage will see the exchange of the bodies of deceased hostages and combatants returned to their respective sides. A three-to-five-year plan will commence, focusing on rebuilding homes, infrastructure, and civilian facilities. The process will be overseen by Egypt, Qatar, and the United Nations. The complete blockade of Gaza will be lifted, enabling economic recovery and humanitarian relief.The agreement mirrors a proposal previously outlined by US President Joe Biden. Notably, the deal prioritizes the release of American hostages early in the process.The conflict, which began with Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, has exacted a heavy toll. Approximately 1,200 Israelis were killed during the initial Hamas assault. Over 46,000 Palestinians, including thousands of women and children, have died in Gaza, according to local health authorities.The Israeli military claims to have eliminated 17,000 Hamas fighters. Nearly 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced. The enclave’s infrastructure lies in ruins, with hundreds of thousands living in dire conditions in coastal tent camps.","Israel and Hamas have reached a ceasefire and hostage release agreement.

Premiers meet with Trudeau in Ottawa to plan response to Trump's tariff threat

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday that while Canada hopes to avoid a trade war with the US, it is prepared to respond strongly if necessary.The Prime Minister met with provincial and territorial leaders in Ottawa on Wednesday to discuss the looming threat of US tariffs, following US President-elect Donald Trump ’s warning of a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports.Trudeau confirmed that ""nothing is off the table"" regarding retaliatory measures, but also made it clear that the burden of such actions should be shared across Canada to avoid unfairly targeting one region.The possible retaliatory measures discussed include imposing tariffs on American goods, such as steel products, glassware, and even Florida orange juice, reported AFP.Provincial leaders, including Alberta's Premier Danielle Smith, raised concerns over cutting off oil and energy exports to the US, a suggestion that was met with resistance. Smith, whose province is a major oil exporter to the US, said that Alberta would not support such a move, emphasising the need to protect the energy sector.Ontario Premier Doug Ford, on the other hand, argued for a unified response, saying, ""When Donald Trump comes at us... he's coming full tilt at Canadians as a whole."" He stressed the importance of a strong retaliatory response to send a clear message to the US.The Canadian government has also pledged nearly $1 billion for new border security measures to address concerns over illegal drug trade and human trafficking.The US-Canada trade relationship is vital.

HAVANA: Cuba started releasing some prisoners Wednesday as part of talks with the Vatican, a day after President Joe Biden's administration announced his intent to lift the US designation of the island nation as a state sponsor of terrorism.More than a dozen people who were convicted of different crimes and some of them were arrested after taking part in the historic 2021 protests, were released during the day, according to Cuban civil groups following the cases of detainees on the island.Among those freed was tattooist Reyna Yacnara Barreto Batista , 24, who was detained in the 2021 protests and convicted to four years in prison for attacks and public disorder. She was released from a prison in the province of Camaguey and told The Associated Press that eight men were also freed along with her.On Tuesday, the US government said it notified Congress about the intent to lift the designation of Cuba as part of a deal facilitated by the Vatican. Cuban authorities would release some of them before Biden's administration ends on Jan. 20, officials said.Hours later, the Cuban foreign ministry said the government informed Pope Francis it would gradually release 553 convicts as authorities explore legal and humanitarian ways to make it happen.Havana did not link the prisoners' release to the US decision on lifting the designation but said it was ""in the spirit of the Ordinary Jubilee of the year 2025 declared by His Holiness,"" referring to the Vatican's once-every-25-year tradition of a Jubilee, in which the Catholic faithful make pilgrimages to Rome.The Cuban Observatory of Human Rights, one of the civil groups, said that by 4 pm EST, 18 people had been released, including Barreto Batista.""At three in the morning they knocked,"" Barreto Batista told the AP over the phone. ""I was sleeping (in the cell) and they told me to gather all my things, that I was free.""She said that she and the eight men were warned it was not a pardon or forgiveness and that they had to be on good behavior or they could be sent back to prison.""I am at home with my mother,"" she said. ""The whole family is celebrating.""In July 2021, thousands of Cubans took to the streets to protest widespread power outages and shortages amid a severe economic crisis. The government's crackdown on the demonstrators, which included arrests and detentions, sparked international criticism, while Cuban officials blamed US sanctions and a media campaign for the unrest.In November, another Cuban nongovernmental organization, Justice 11J, said that 554 people remained in custody in connection with the protests.Biden's intention to lift the US designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism is likely to be reversed as early as next week after President-elect Donald Trump takes office and Secretary of State-designate Marco Rubio assumes the position of America's top diplomat.Rubio, whose family left Cuba in the 1950s before the communist revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power, has long been a proponent of sanctions on the communist island.","More than a dozen people who were convicted of different crimes and some of them were arrested after taking part in the historic 2021 protests, were released during the day.

The Broader Context of Criticism



Shifting the Narrative



Social media has erupted with accusations of hypocrisy directed at liberals who have remained relatively silent about allegations of sexual misconduct against Neil Gaiman while continuing to vilify J.K. Rowling for her views on gender. Critics argue that Rowling has faced disproportionate backlash for her stance on biological sex, while Gaiman, a celebrated author with progressive credentials, has been met with tepid criticism despite facing serious allegations.Neil Gaiman, known for works like The Sandman and Good Omens, has been accused by two women of misconduct. Scarlett Pavlovich, a former nanny, alleged non-consensual sexual acts, while another woman, identified as ""K,"" described an exploitative and emotionally damaging relationship. The fallout has reportedly affected several of Gaiman’s high-profile projects, with Disney’s The Graveyard Book and Good Omens Season 3 on hold and his role in Netflix’s The Sandman reportedly reduced.Gaiman issued a carefully worded statement denying non-consensual activity but admitting he was ""emotionally unavailable while being sexually available"" and ""careless with people’s hearts."" He added, ""Like most of us, I’m learning and trying to do the work needed.""Social media users have pointed out the disparity in how Gaiman and Rowling are treated. Rowling has faced years of relentless backlash for her defence of women’s spaces and her belief in the reality of biological sex, while Gaiman’s progressive persona appears to have insulated him from a similar level of scrutiny.These comments underscore the frustration many feel about what they see as selective outrage within progressive circles.Gaiman’s progressive credentials, including his feminist-leaning rhetoric and support for trans activism, have likely shielded him from the same level of backlash faced by Rowling. Critics argue this discrepancy highlights a trend where liberal figures are excused for their actions if they align with the ""right"" ideological causes, while dissenters like Rowling are relentlessly targeted for their views.Accusations of hypocrisy have also been directed at the broader feminist and trans activist communities, with many questioning why safeguarding women’s rights, as championed by Rowling, is met with hostility while allegations of abuse by a celebrated male ally provoke muted responses.The backlash against Gaiman has reignited discussions about accountability in progressive spaces . While Rowling has been demonised for expressing her beliefs, Gaiman’s accusations have been met with carefully worded statements of regret and promises to ""do the work."" Critics argue that this disparity reveals a performative aspect to liberal outrage, where the focus is less on justice and more on adherence to ideological orthodoxy.The unfolding controversy around Gaiman and Rowling underscores the complexities of modern cultural discourse , where personal behaviour and ideological alignment are often judged on uneven terms.",Neil Gaiman has been accused by two women of sexual misconduct.

Senior officials from President-elect Donald Trump's administration, including the majority of his designated Cabinet nominees, were at the White House on Wednesday to participate in a transition exercise hosted by President Joe Biden's team.The transition tabletop exercise was chaired by Homeland Security Adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall in the White House Situation Room, the White House said, and included a substantial share of Biden's outgoing Cabinet for the two-hour session. The exercise has been a key part of presidential transitions since the September 11, 2001, attacks and give the outgoing and incoming teams a chance to rehearse how to respond to and manage a range of national security crises.Wednesday's simulation touched on the management of potential terror attacks and avian flu, among other challenges.The exercises can sometimes become an eerie preview of reality. During the 2016-17 transition from then-President Barack Obama to Trump, one such exercise included a discussion of the U.S. response to a global public health event. Three years later, Trump's administration was confronted with the COVID-19 pandemic.It comes two weeks after an Islamic State-inspired attack in New Orleans on New Year's Day killed 14 people and injured more than two dozen. The country is currently managing an avian flu outbreak that has killed one person and affected the nation's food supply.Attendees included Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump's pick for secretary of state; former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's nominee for director of national intelligence; his defense secretary pick Pete Hegseth; and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, his nominee for homeland security secretary, among others. Rep. Mike Waltz, the incoming national security adviser, and other senior White House staffers also represented the Trump team.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Attorney General Merrick Garland and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg were among the Biden Cabinet officials or their deputies who participated in the session, which came hours after the U.S. helped broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.The Biden team has been highlighting its efforts to cooperate with Trump's transition effort, including responding to hundreds of requests for information across the government on ongoing programs and sharing briefings on the top five to 10 most pressing issues at each agency. The White House separately briefed Trump's team on top issues, including global health, disaster response and artificial intelligence, that may require action in the first six months of the new administration.Wednesday's exercise follows an earlier tabletop in November with senior career government staffers to prepare to support the incoming administration.Separately, Susie Wiles, Trump's White House chief of staff was seen in the West Wing earlier Wednesday ahead of the exercise meeting with senior members of the incumbent administration.","The tabletop exercise was chaired by Homeland Security Adviser Liz Sherwood- Randall in the White House Situation Room.

""We have a deal for the hostages. They will be released shortly. Thank you!"" he wrote on his Truth Social network, before any official announcement from outgoing President Joe Biden's White House.Trump had warned Palestinian armed group Hamas of ""hell to pay"" if it did not free the captives before he took office, and envoys from both his incoming administration and Biden's outgoing one had been present at the latest negotiations. ""This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November,"" Trump added in a lengthy second post.Netanyahu's office, however, said several clauses in the framework remain unresolved, and we hope that the details will be finalised tonight. Any agreement needs to be approved by Netanyahu's cabinet.The two statement came after multiple officials said that negotiators from Israel and Hamas had agreed to a ceasefire deal to pause the devastating war in Gaza, raising the possibility of winding down the deadliest and most destructive fighting between the bitter enemies. Three officials from the United States and one from Hamas confirmed that the deal had been reached. Basem Naim, a Hamas official, confirmed the agreement, although the militant group had yet to release a formal statement.The deal, coming after weeks of painstaking negotiations in the Qatari capital, promises the release of dozens of hostages held by Hamas in phases, the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israel and would allow hundreds of thousands of people displaced in Gaza to return to what remains of their homes. It also would flood badly needed humanitarian aid into a territory ravaged by 15 months of war.Once official, the deal is expected to deliver an initial six-week halt to fighting that is to be accompanied by the opening of negotiations on ending the war altogether. Over six weeks, 33 of the nearly 100 hostages are to be reunited with their loved ones after months in captivity with no contact with the outside world, though it's unclear if all are alive.

Many longer-term questions about postwar Gaza remain, including who will rule the territory or oversee the daunting task of reconstruction after a brutal conflict that has destabilized the broader Middle East and sparked worldwide protests.Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border attack, which killed some 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel responded with a fierce offensive that has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza's population and sparked a humanitarian crisis.The US along with Egypt and Qatar, have brokered months of indirect talks between the bitter enemies that finally culminated in this latest deal. It comes after Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire in Nov, after more than a year of conflict linked to the war in the Gaza.

Former US President Barack Obama

The United States and Qatar have confirmed a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, halting the brutal 15-month conflict in Gaza and paving the way for the release of numerous hostages. The ceasefire deal will be implemented in three phases, according to US President Joe Biden The first phase, lasting six weeks, includes a full ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza’s populated areas, and the release of hostages, including Americans. In return, Israel will release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners , and Palestinians can return to their neighborhoods. Phase 2 focuses on negotiating a permanent end to the war, with the release of remaining hostages and complete Israeli withdrawal, making the ceasefire permanent. Phase 3 will see the return of deceased hostages' remains and the initiation of Gaza's reconstruction.The ceasefire has garnered reactions from various world leaders, including Joe Biden, Donald Trump , and Barack Obama US President Joe Biden announced the ceasefire during a press briefing, saying, ""It's a very good afternoon because at long last, I can announce a ceasefire and a hostage deal has been reached between Israel and Hamas. More than 15 months of terror for the hostages, their families, and the Israeli people and more than 15 months of suffering by the innocent people of Gaza. Fighting in Gaza will stop and soon the hostages will return home to their families.""Biden described the negotiations as one of the toughest he has experienced, attributing the deal’s success to the pressure Israel built on Hamas with US support.""Those who have followed the negotiations can attest that the road to this deal has not been easy. I have worked in foreign policy for decades. This is one of the toughest negotiations that I have ever experienced. I have reached this point because of the pressure that Israel built on Hamas, backed by the US. The US also organized a coalition of 20 countries to stand up to attacks by the Houthis, including their missile attacks in Israel. At the G20 in Delhi in September 2023, I rallied key countries behind a vision of an economic charter from India across the Middle East to Europe that vision can now become a reality.""US President-elect Donald Trump expressed his delight at the ceasefire news on his Truth Social platform, saying, ""This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies. I am thrilled American and Israeli hostages will be returning home to be reunited with their families and loved ones.""Trump added that he would leverage the Gaza ceasefire deal to further expand the Abraham Accords, US-sponsored agreements made during his first term that normalized Israel’s relations with multiple Arab nations.""We will continue promoting PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH throughout the region, as we build upon the momentum of this ceasefire to further expand the Historic Abraham Accords. This is only the beginning of great things to come for America, and indeed, the World!""The president-elect also added that his national security team, through the efforts of special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, would continue to work closely with Israel and its allies to ensure Gaza would never again become a 'terrorist safe haven.'""With this deal in place, my National Security team, through the efforts of Special Envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, will continue to work closely with Israel and our Allies to make sure Gaza NEVER again becomes a terrorist safe haven.""Former US President Barack Obama called the ceasefire deal ""good news"" for the families of the hostages taken on October 7, the Palestinian civilians who have suffered for over a year, and everyone who has prayed for an end to this conflict.""The ceasefire and hostage release deal announced between Israel and Hamas is good news – for the families of the hostages taken on October 7th, for the Palestinian civilians who have suffered for more than a year, and for everyone who has prayed for an end to this awful chapter.""Obama acknowledged that no deal can ease the pain of those who have lost loved ones or resolve the long-standing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. ""That work will be much harder, and take much longer. But it will put a stop to the bloodshed, allow people to return to their homes, and get much-needed aid to more than a million desperate, hungry people,"" he said.The former president expressed his support for the deal, saying, ""That’s something we should all support."" He also expressed gratitude to Biden, US state of secretary Antony IsraelBlinken, and all the leaders and diplomatic teams from around the world who worked hard to achieve this agreement.","Ceasefire between Israel and Hamas will be implemented in three phases.

Michelle Obama: Michelle Obama is skipping Trump's inauguration because she is not 'phoney'. 'Who is she taking dig at?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/michelle-obama-is-skipping-trumps-inauguration-because-she-is-not-phoney-who-is-she-taking-dig-at/articleshow/117277450.cms,"Michelle Obama is not pretentious about where she wants to turn up and where not, sources said on her decision to skip Jan 20 inauguration

The real reason Michelle Obama is skipping Donald Trump's inauguration and not even giving any explanation is because she is not phoney, a PageSix report citing sources said. This triggered speculation whether Michelle's dig is at her husband Barack Obama who was seen having a conversation with Donald Trump at Jimmy Carter's funeral. Michelle Obama skipped that event too and she was the only former first lady absent. It was said that she was on an extended vacation in Hawaii.But her absence from two events back to back -- both the events would have brought her face to face with Donald Trump now -- establishes that it is an intentional snub from the former first lady to Donald Trump.""While her husband appears to be playing nice with the president-elect, Michelle won’t do the same,"" Page Six reported.Without giving any excuse, the Office of Barack and Michelle Obama simply announced that Michelle “will not attend the upcoming inauguration,” in a statement to the Associated Press on Tuesday.“She’s never been fake and she’s never been phony. She’s always been very deliberate about where and how she shows up,” the source said.“She showed up reluctantly for the election. They were united, but she doesn’t have to unify around [Trump]. She doesn’t have to say anything. Her absence speaks volumes,” they added.“For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us. See, his limited, narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly successful people who happen to be black,” Michelle Obama said at the Democratic National Convention. Trump boosted the “birther movement,” the conspiracy theory that the former president wasn’t born in America, for several years leading up to his 2016 presidential run. He eventually admitted he was wrong, but did not apologize.“Why would we normalize that type of backwards leadership? Doing so only demeans and cheapens our politics,” Michelle said at the DNC. “Most of us will never be afforded the grace of failing forward. We will never benefit from the affirmative action of generational wealth. If we bankrupt a business or choke in a crisis, we don’t get a second, third or fourth chance,” she added.","Michelle Obama is not pretentious about where she wants to turn up and where not, sources said on her decision to skip Jan 20 inauguration.

Who gets the credit of Israel-Hamas deal? 'Is that a joke?'



Donald Trump takes credit, says won't have been possible without his win



US President Joe Biden Wednesday said his administration and incoming president Donald Trump 's team are on the same team as far as negotiations on Gaza deal is concerned. Explaining the three-phase deal, Bidensaid that during the next six weeks of the first phase of the ceasefire, Israel will negotiate the necessary arrangements for phase two – “a permanent end to the war”.The US president said that there are a “number of details” to negotiate to move from the first and second phase. If negotiations take longer than six weeks, then the ceasefire will continue as long as the negotiations continue, he said. Phase two will allow for an exchange for the release of all the remaining living hostages, including male soldiers. The second phase will also involve all remaining Israeli forces to be withdrawn from Gaza, and for the temporary ceasefire to become permanent, he said. In phase three, any final remains of the hostages who have been killed would be returned to their families.On being asked about how much credit he would give to the incoming Donald Trump administration, Biden said this is the exact framework of the deal ""I proposed back in May. Exact"". But Biden added that since the deal will unfold in the coming administration, he told his team to coordinate closely with the incoming Trump team to make sure ""we're all speaking with the same voice,e because that's what American presidents do.""""In the past few days, we have been speaking as one team,"" Biden said.""I laid out the precise contours of this plan on May 31, 2024, after which it was endorsed unanimously by the UN Security Council. It is the result not only of the extreme pressure that Hamas has been under and the changed regional equation after a ceasefire in Lebanon and weakening of Iran — but also of dogged and painstaking American diplomacy. My diplomacy never ceased in their efforts to get this done,"" Biden said in his statement.As Biden began to leave the room after the conference, a reporter called out: ““Who deserves credit for this Mr President, you or Trump?” Biden turned around and replied: “Is that a joke?”Calling the ceasefire agreement EPIC, Donald Trump said it could have been possible only as a result of his 'historic' victory in November ""as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,"" Trump posted on Truth Social.","Joe Biden said he and Donald Trump are on the same team on Israel-Hamas agreement.

ISLAMABAD: Nobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai criticized Taliban on Sunday, saying that they do not regard women as human beings and has established a system of “gender apartheid,” justifying their crimes with cultural and religious excuses.“Taliban do not see women as human beings. They cloak their crimes in cultural and religious justifications. They punish women and girls who dare to defy their opaque laws by beating, arresting, or injuring them,” Malala said at a summit in Islamabad focused on girls’ education in Muslim countries.Since retaking power in Afghanistan in 2021, Taliban regime has enforced a strict interpretation of Islamic law, depriving women of participation in many areas of public life. Their restrictions have prevented women and girls from attending secondary and university schools, as well as holding many govt jobs.“They want to eliminate women and girls from every aspect of public life and erase them from society. These policies have no basis in Islamic teachings,” she said.Malala called on Muslim leaders to demonstrate true leadership by refusing to legitimize Taliban govt. “It is time for Muslim leaders to raise your voices and use your power to oppose such injustices,” she added.Afghanistan's Taliban govt snubbed the event by rejecting the invitation. ""No one from there came to participate in the conference,"" Pakistan's education minister, Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, said.Malala also condemned Israel's actions in Gaza.

BALOCHISTAN: Pakistan security forces have been accused of forcibly disappearing three individuals from Balochistan's Kech and Sibi districts.The alleged detentions are part of an ongoing pattern of enforced disappearances in the region, which has raised significant concern among human rights organizations and local communities, as reported by the Balochistan Post.According to the Balochistan Post, Irshad Ahmed, a young man, was allegedly apprehended by Pakistani forces at a medical store in Turbat. He was reportedly taken to an undisclosed location, with his whereabouts remaining unknown.The Balochistan Post further reported that similarly, Nawaz Nadil, a 17-year-old student from the Balochistan Residential College (BRC), was allegedly detained by military personnel at the Gamshad Hotel in Turbat. His family has expressed deep concern for his safety, as they have not been informed of his location or the reasons for his detention.In a separate incident, Gul Hassan Sabir, a resident of Sibi, was taken by Pakistani forces on the evening of November 19, 2024, at approximately 9 PM. He was detained in front of a bus stop, and his family has been unable to ascertain his whereabouts since the incident.

"Jailed ex-Pakistan PM Imran Khan demands fair probe in violence cases, slams government’s 'non-serious' attitude",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/jailed-ex-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-demands-fair-probe-in-violence-cases-slams-governments-non-serious-attitude/articleshow/117149292.cms,"Pakistan's former PM Imran Khan (File photo)

Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently in Adiala Jail , demanded a transparent investigation and the establishment of a judicial commission to examine violence on November 26 and May 9. He communicated this demand to lawyers and media during a meeting at the jail.Regarding ongoing negotiations in the country, Khan expressed skepticism, stating, ""The government's non-serious attitude towards negotiations is evident from the fact that I haven't even been allowed to meet with my negotiation committee yet. It seems like the purpose of negotiations is merely to waste time so that public reaction over the November 26th Islamabad massacre starts to fade.""Khan called for an impartial judicial commission to investigate the incidents, particularly the November 26 event. ""Peaceful citizens were massacred on November 26th; they were directly shot at, and D-Chowk was drenched in their blood. Many of our people are still missing. In any civilized society, those responsible for such shootings would have been held accountable, but this government has not even managed to form a judicial commission yet. A judicial commission acts as a (neutral) third umpire. Only an impartial commission can provide justice to the martyrs of November 26th (2024) and May 9th (2023). If this massacre is swept under the rug, no one’s life or property in Pakistan will be safe,"" he said.He also alleged mistreatment of PTI members in custody and called for these claims to be raised internationally. ""While in military custody, our innocent people were subjected to severe mental and physical torture. According to my information, three young men attempted suicide during custody. Sami Wazir’s condition is a stark testament to this brutality. What happened to PTI leaders like Shahbaz Gill and Azam Swati is no secret. Zille Shah was brutally murdered, and Intezar Panjutha was treated worse than animals. What kind of justice is this? Those who leave PTI are absolved of any charges related to May 9th, while those who refuse are subjected to all kinds of torture and pressure,"" Khan stated.Further threatening to take the alleges injustice to global forums, the ex-Pakistan PM added, ""We haven't obtained justice despite repeatedly appealing to Pakistan’s judicial system, leaving us with no choice but to raise our voice on international forums. Pakistan’s government is bound by international laws and treaties regarding human rights. I have instructed our lawyers to take these matters to global forums and draw the world’s attention to the ongoing human rights violations in Pakistan.""In connection to the May 9 case, Imran Khan has approached the Lahore High Court for bail, according to ARY News. The case is centred around severe unrest across Pakistan following Imran Khan's arrest on May 9, 2023. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters demonstrated their outrage through widespread protests in both rural and urban areas, prompting authorities to deploy military forces in Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Islamabad to maintain security. During these demonstrations, PTI supporters targeted military facilities, including an assault on the Corps Commander's residence in Lahore. Subsequently, Imran Khan was named as the primary accused in the legal proceedings. The November 26 protests were also centred on similar demands with PTI members demanding release of their leader.Khan also addressed the people of Pakistan saying, ""My message to overseas Pakistanis is that democracy and human rights have been obliterated in Pakistan, to be replaced by the law of the jungle. Your boycott of foreign currency remittances is critical. Your loved ones in Pakistan deserve the same rights that you enjoy abroad.""Khan also talked about the fake allegations and cases against him while putting forward the demand for transparent investigation and justice. ""Our government was falsely accused of resettling the Taliban. Terrorism did not resurface during our tenure, and even a year after it ended. The same people who are responsible for conditions in Balochistan are also responsible for the current chaos,"" he said adding, "" No leader in Pakistan’s history has ever faced 280 cases. This kind of treatment was only meted out to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during General Yahya's rule, and now it is being done to me.""Additionally, citing a World Bank report, Khan expressed concern about rising poverty and the impact of political instability on the economy. ""according to a recent World Bank report, an additional 13 million people have fallen below the poverty line. Every institution, including the judiciary, NAB, FIA, and police, have been tasked to work against PTI, causing political and economic systems to collapse and instability to reach its peak. Economic growth will remain zero as long as political instability persists. All of this is being done to bolster the plan for a decade-long dictatorship. Anyone who supports this lawlessness can have their corruption of billions pardoned.""According to PTI, Khan has been imprisoned for over 520 days.",Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan is currently in Adiala Jail.
