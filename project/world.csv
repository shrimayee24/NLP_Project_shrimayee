Muskan and Sahil first attempted to drug him on February 25, but the sedative-laced food only made him drowsy.Later on March 4, they successfully sedated him before stabbing and dismembering him to conceal evidence. Saurabh's body was initially hidden in a bathroom overnight before being sealed inside a cement-filled drum for two weeks.Following the murder, the duo went on a 12-day trip to Himachal Pradesh.During their investigation, police discovered Sahil’s room filled with disturbing imagery—walls covered in red and black tantric symbols, devil graffiti, cryptic English phrases, beer cans, bidi stubs, and other scattered items, creating an eerie atmosphere.Investigators believe Sahil was highly superstitious, which Muskan exploited to manipulate him. She allegedly used her brother’s phone to create fake Snapchat accounts, deceiving Sahil into believing his deceased mother was speaking to him from the afterlife and demanding a sacrifice.Muskan’s mother, Kavita, had previously told police that, ""Saurabh was mad for my daughter.

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

A federal judge on Thursday blocked the Trump administration's effort to deport Badar Khan Suri , an Indian post-doc fellow at Georgetown University who has been detained by immigration authorities for alleged pro-Hamas activism, saying he should not removed from the US pending the outcome of the legal challenge seeking his release.Virginia Eastern District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles did not rule on the merits of the deportation case itself but suggested Suri's habeas corpus needs to be heard first in an order stating he ""shall not be removed from the U.S unless and until the Court issues a contrary order.""Suri's attorney has said his client was abducted from his apartment in Rosslyn, Virginia, a suburb outside Washington DC, and is incarcerated in distant Louisiana, where the Syria-born Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil has also been imprisoned at a different facility.Khalil's attorneys too are fighting his deportation, and after accusing authorities of moving their client to a more conservative jurisdiction (Louisiana is a deep red Republican state), they got the case transferred to New Jersey.The detentions follow a Trump crackdown on liberal campuses where student activists have been protesting and criticizing -- both directly and on social media -- U.S foreign policy with regards to the Israel-Palestinian issue.The Trump administration says foreign students, even if they have Green cards and valid visas, are violating terms of their stay with political activism that pose a threat to US national security. Administration officials have warned that many more foreign student activists will be identified and deported.Free speech advocates maintain the administration's actions are a violation of the First Amendment, even with regards to foreign scholars, with some recalling campus anti-Vietnam war protests in the 1960s. “Badar Khan Suri’s detention is a clear violation of his constitutional rights, and he must be released,” Virginia Democrat lawmaker Don Beyer said Thursday, adding, “The ‘justification’ given for these violations of Mr. Suri’s right to due process is another violation of the Constitution: a blatant attack on the First Amendment.""The judicial interventions that are stalling the deportations has enraged President Trump, who says lawyers ""endlessly search"" for "" radical left judges "" to thwart the administration's effort to deport dangerous illegal immigrants, although the crackdown now targets even legal residents.According to a rough count by legal mavens, Out of 679 active federal district court judges, 384 were appointed by Democratic presidents, and 257 appointed by Republican presidents. In the Appeals Court, out of 179 active judges, 88 were appointed by Democratic presidents, and 89 were appointed by Republican presidents. Six of the nine Supreme Court judges have been appointed by Republican Presidents, including three by Trump.But the US President and his acolytes, including Elon Musk, are still unhappy and want Roberts to sign off on moves to impeach liberal justices balking at an imperial presidency they are aiming for, where the President's authority is unquestioned. Roberts, who has suggested the administration can go through with the appeals process rather than target the judges.In a series of posts, Trump raged that ""Unlawful Nationwide Injunctions by Radical Left Judges could very well lead to the destruction of our Country!""""These people are Lunatics, who do not care, even a little bit, about the repercussions from their very dangerous and incorrect Decisions and Rulings,"" Trump fumed, adding that ""No District Court Judge, or any Judge, can assume the duties of the President of the United States. Only Crime and Chaos would result.""Judges are now being openly identified as ""Obama judges"" ""Biden judges"" ""Bush judges"" etc depending on who and in what year they were appointed. Chief Justice John Roberts himself --- a Conservative Republican Bush appointee -- is under attack from MAGA for not consistently ruling in favor of Trump and resisting the move to impeach liberal judges.""If Justice Roberts and the United States Supreme Court do not fix this toxic and unprecedented situation IMMEDIATELY, our Country is in very serious trouble!""

Terry Bradshaw’s political shift: Why the NFL legend chose to stay neutral



Terry Bradshaw , the legendary NFL quarterback turned television personality, has taken a rare path in the often politically charged landscape of professional sports. While numerous celebrities and sports figures have openly voiced their political opinions, especially since Donald Trump ’s initial presidential campaign a decade ago, Bradshaw has opted for a more reserved approach. Unlike several high-profile NFL names who have publicly backed Trump, Bradshaw has consciously chosen to remain politically neutral—a stance that reflects both his evolving political beliefs and his desire to avoid alienating fans.Donald Trump has received notable endorsements from influential NFL figures, including Hall of Fame quarterbacks Brett Favre, John Elway, and Fran Tarkenton. Current NFL stars like Nick Bosa, Gardner Minshew II, and Harrison Butker have also shown public support for the former president. However, at 76, Terry Bradshaw has stood apart by choosing not to align himself with any political party.In a 2020 interview with Business Jet Traveler, Bradshaw opened up about his political shift. After being a longtime Republican, Bradshaw made the decision to switch political parties and register as an Independent. His reasoning was straightforward and pragmatic: ""I've been a Republican, but now I'm a registered independent. I don't want to alienate anyone, and the minute you say, 'I'm a Democrat' or 'I'm Republican,' you're kicking off the other side. I want the best person [in the White House], and I'll pick the one who's most like the way I feel.""Bradshaw’s move reflects his desire to remain open-minded and focused on leadership qualities rather than party loyalty. His switch mirrors a growing sentiment among public figures who feel constrained by rigid political affiliations. Notably, other athletes like Danica Patrick and Charles Barkley have also made similar moves in recent years.While Bradshaw has generally avoided taking sides, he has not shied away from criticizing political decisions when he feels compelled to speak out. One of the most notable instances came during Donald Trump's presidency when the former president condemned NFL players for kneeling during the national anthem as a form of protest. Bradshaw was vocal in defending the players' right to protest, emphasizing the core values of American freedom.""This is America. If our country stands for anything, folks, it's freedom. People died for that freedom. I'm not sure if our President understands those rights—that every American has the right to speak out and to protest. Believe me, these athletes do love this great country of ours,"" Bradshaw stated. He further added, ""Personally, I think our President should concentrate on North Korea and healthcare rather than ripping into athletes and the NFL.""Bradshaw’s remarks underscored his belief in free expression and the importance of focusing on larger national issues rather than politicizing sports. His balanced approach allows him to maintain credibility and connection with a broad audience, avoiding the divisiveness that often comes with strong political statements.Despite his political shift, Bradshaw remains a prominent figure in the NFL world. As a key part of FOX’s broadcasting team, he continues to be a familiar face to football fans every week. While his longtime colleague Jimmy Johnson has decided to retire, Bradshaw intends to stay on air at least until FOX’s next Super Bowl broadcast.Also Read: ""Please be true"": Excited Joe Burrow fuels buzz over Bengals’ possible 2025 international appearance Bradshaw’s decision to remain politically independent reflects a thoughtful, measured stance in a time when public figures face increasing pressure to declare their allegiances. By prioritizing leadership over party loyalty, Bradshaw has set an example of focusing on unity rather than division—a stance that resonates with both sports fans and beyond.","Terry Bradshaw has chosen to remain politically neutral.

Joshua back home, Konanki's body still not found



The father of Joshua Riibe who was called a 'person of interest' in the highly sensational disappearance case of Sudiksha Konanki was seen flustered as Joshua was detained in Puerto Rico on his way home from Dominican Republic to Iowa. “I’m just a dad, who had his son taken away, and I don’t understand, we just spent two weeks trying to stay together, and now … I don’t understand,” Riibe's father complained.According to reports, Joshua Riibe was allowed to leave the Dominican Republic after Sudiksha Konanki's parents appealed to the DR authorities to declare Konanki dead. They said they believed that Riibe was not involved in any foul play and that Konanki was indeed drowned in the ocean. They appealed for Riibe's release as well and thanked him for his cooperation in the probe.Reports said Joshua was detained in the airport as his newly replaced US passport did not have the correct stamp on it.Sudiksha Konanki, a 20-year-old Pittsburg University student, went to the Dominican Republic on a vacation with her friends. She mysteriously disappeared after being seen last with Riibe whom she met at the resort. Riibe told police that he had gone to the ocean with Konanki and that they had been caught in huge waves against which he battled and pulled Konanki to the shore.Joshua asserted that Konanki was with him when he reached the shore but was not there the next morning when he woke up. He thought Konanki went to the resort. Konanki's clothes were found on the beach.The case became sensational after Konanki's parents initially ruled out drowning and suspected foul play. Both Konanki and Riibe were evidently drunk when they went to the ocean. Riibe told the cops that they kissed in the water when they were caught in high waves.","Sudiksha Konanki, a 20-year-old Pittsburg University student, went to the Dominican Republic on a vacation with her friends.

Humanitarian parole policy under Joe Biden

MIAMI: The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has announced revocation of legal safeguards for around 532,000 individuals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, who have been in the US since October 2022.These immigrants, who entered America with financial sponsors and received two-year residency and work permits, will lose their legal status on April 24, or 30 days after the Federal Register publishes the notice.The DHS directive affects individuals currently residing in the US under the humanitarian parole programme. It follows the Trump administration's previous decision to terminate what they said was a ""broad abuse"" of humanitarian parole, a legal provision historically used by US Presidents to provide temporary residency in the country to people from nations experiencing warfare or political unrest.During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump, then the Republican Party's candidate for Oval Office, had vowed to remove individuals residing illegally in theUS. Since commencing his second term in January, the MAGA leader has consistently restricted legal immigration pathways for entry and residency in the United States.Prior to this DHS order, humanitarian parole participants could remain in the US until their parole expired, despite the administration's cessation of processing asylum applications, visas, and other requests for extended stays.However, legal challenges to the DHS order have already been filed in federal courts. American citizens and immigrants have jointly filed a lawsuit against the termination of humanitarian parole, seeking to restore the programme for the four nationalities.The administration of Trump's predecessor Joe Biden permitted monthly entry of up to 30,000 individuals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, for two-year periods with work authorisation. Mexico, too, agreed to accept an equal number of deportees from these four countries due to US deportation limitations.Cuba accepted approximately one deportation flight monthly, while Venezuela and Nicaragua refused deportations. The three nations maintain adversarial relationships with the US.On the other hand, Haiti accepted numerous deportation flights, particularly following a migrant surge in Del Rio, Texas, in 2021. However, ongoing instability there has complicated US deportation efforts.Since late 2022, over 500,000 people have entered the US under CHNV (Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans) policy. This initiative formed part of the Biden administration's strategy to promote legal entry channels whilst increasing enforcement against illegal border crossings.","Around 532,000 individuals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela have been in the US since October 2022.

murder case

'Unfit for society'

MEERUT: Just days after brutally murdering her husband, dismembering his body, and leaving it to decompose in a cement-filled drum, Muskaan Rastogi was seen celebrating Holi with her lover, Sahil Shukla , as if nothing had happened.A video shows Muskaan and Sahil smiling at the camera, their faces smeared with colour. Another clip captures Muskaan celebrating her birthday with Sahil, feeding him cake.The couple was also spotted enjoying a trip together.Saurabh, an ex-merchant navy officer, returned from London to Meerut on February 24, hoping to surprise his wife on her birthday. Instead, he walked into a death trap. By the time his disappearance raised suspicions, he had already been drugged, murdered, beheaded, and left to rot in a plastic drum for nearly two weeks. The crime, committed on March 4, was only uncovered on Tuesday.SP (City) Ayush Vikram Singh revealed that Muskaan had been plotting the murder since November. ""She manipulated Sahil through fake Snapchat messages, making him believe they were signs from his deceased mother. Days before Saurabh's return, she bought two knives, claiming they were for cutting chicken, and faked anxiety to obtain sedatives, which she later used to drug her husband before the attack.""""Muskaan exploited Sahil’s grief over his late mother, convincing him that she had reincarnated and was guiding him to kill Saurabh,"" Singh added. ""She also told Sahil that Saurabh was not in the merchant navy but working in a bakery in London. These claims are being verified.""Both Muskaan and Sahil have been charged with murder and destruction of evidence .Muskaan’s parents have distanced themselves from their daughter, demanding the strictest punishment. ""That kid (Saurabh Rajput) was a good man. We demand justice and want her to be hanged till death,"" her mother told ANI.Her father echoed the sentiment, stating, ""My daughter killed her husband. She is unfit for society and a danger to everyone. I would advise others not to take such steps.

When Kerala Muslims thank Hindu royals for masjid fight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kozhikode/when-kerala-muslims-thank-hindu-royals-for-masjid-fight/articleshow/119328095.cms,"KOZHIKODE: At a time when historical sites and tombs linked to medieval Muslim rulers have become flashpoints in the country, the Muslim community of Kuttichira in Kerala upholds a tradition of communal harmony in keeping with the true spirit of Ramzan. Their representatives will visit descendants of the Zamorins, erstwhile Hindu rulers of Malabaron Sunday, the 22nd day of Ramzan, as thanksgiving for defending the historical Mishkal Mosque from a Portuguese attack on the same day in 1510.The visit also commemorates the Zamorin’s retribution — he captured the Portuguese Chaliyam Fort in 1571 and reconstructed the mosque using the remnants of the fort. This year, representatives of various organisations in Kuttichira — including descendants of the Qazi family, the mosque committee and Qazi Foundation — will visit the Thiruvanoor residence of the present titular Zamorin, K C Unni Anujan Raja, on Sunday. The delegation, led by acting qazi of Kozhikode and qazi of Mishkal Mosque Safeer Saqafi, will also present a memento to him.In 1510, when Portuguese forces led by Afonso de Albuquerque attempted to burn down Mishkal Mosque, the then Zamorin dispatched a 500-member army, largely comprising Nair warriors. The warriors fought alongside local Muslims, and some of them even laid down their lives resisting the attack, though part of the mosque was burnt down and its mihrab (pulpit) destroyed. The mosque, established by Arab merchant Nakhooda Mishkal, bears scars of the attack.“The visit is a reaffirmation of our social bonds of togetherness and harmony. We have been following it for the past decade to ensure the history of camaraderie does not get drowned in present-day controversies,” said M V Ramsi Ismail, a descendant of Qazi family and general secretary of Qazi Foundation.Ismail said the Portuguese specifically targeted Mishkal Mosque to drive a wedge into the warm relations that existed between Arabs and Zamorins. “Kuttichira is a Muslim neighbourhood but it has some prominent places of worship of other communities, like Shri Bhagwan Kalikund Parshvanath Jain Temple and Gujarati temple. The communities have been living in amity,” he said.Historian P Sivadasan said the Mishkal-Zamorin bond has significance in today’s context, where attempts to steer the country away from the spirit of cultural symbiosis and to rake up ownership disputes over religious sites were on the rise. “The Zamorin’s forces were able to crush the Portuguese in 1571 and capture Chaliyam Fort, which was the first defeat suffered by Europeans in India. The fort was dismantled and, in a symbolic gesture, the Zamorin provided timber from the fort to repair Mishkal Mosque,” he said.","Muslim community of Kuttichira in Kerala upholds a tradition of communal harmony in keeping with the true spirit of Ramzan.

Police detain three suspects, looking for 2 more accused

INDORE: A 24-year-old Indore woman was shot through the eye at a party, and then dumped in a hospital in the wee hours of Friday by those she was partying with, say police.The victim, Bhavana Singh, died around 11am on Friday, eight hours after she was abandoned at Bombay Hospital by a group of men, who claimed she was hit by a stone in the eye, said hospital deputy director Rahul Parashar. Doctors tried to get them to identify her, but they fled, claiming they were going to get her family members.In their haste, however, they dropped a keychain that cracked open the case and landed three of five suspects in custody.It was around 3am on Friday that Bombay Hospital staff saw four-five men pull up in a car and carry a bleeding woman into the building. They turned and ran away, brushing off questions from the stunned staff. Since her vitals were weak and she was bleeding heavily from a punctured eye, she was wheeled into intensive care and put on ventilation.Doctors realised it was a bullet that had pierced her eye and her brain, and not a stone. They immediately alerted police about the anonymous patient and the strange circumstances she was brought in.While doctors fought to save her life, police began trying to identify her and the suspects. Their prime clue was the keychain. It had an address that led officers to a residential building in Mahalaxmi Nagar, said DCP Abhinay Vishwakarma.By then, Bhavana had died. The case was now a murder investigation.Investigators found CCTV footage that showed four men leaving the premises. Police said the house was rented by five young men, two of whom worked with private firms and the others were students. The landlord provided the rental agreement, which had the identities of the tenants, who hailed from Datia, Gwalior, and Satna.Further investigation revealed that the accused had rented a car, which they abandoned in Nipania, around 4km from Bombay Hospital. Bloodstains were found in the car. Its owner confirmed that it was rented by Ashu Yadav, a resident of Datia.Police detained three suspects, and are looking for two more, including Ashu, say sources.Bhavana, who had come to Indore for a make-up artist's course, was a friend of Ashu's live-in partner and attended the party on her invitation, say police. Midway through the party, she got up to leave, which sparked an altercation with Ashu, say sources. Initial probe suggests Ashu allegedly threatened her with a gun, which went off during the altercation, hitting Bhavana in the eye. DCP Vishwakarma confirmed that multiple individuals were involved in the incident and police are searching for the remaining suspects.","24-year-old woman named Bhavana Singh was shot in the eye at a party.

Cab drivers and some autorickshaw unions have confirmed participation, meaning no Ola/Uber cabs and limited autos. State transport employees (KSRTC, NWKRTC, BMTC) are yet to decide.

The SSLC exam schedule remains unchanged, and private unaided schools will continue exams for lower classes despite moral support for the bandh. The TA Narayana Gowda faction has refused to support the bandh, arguing that it affects people's livelihoods and preferring alternative forms of protest.

The bandh highlights concerns over Bengaluru’s governance restructuring, outsider influx, employment issues, and language disputes, including the Belagavi bus conductor assault and governor’s Hindi speech.

BENGALURU: A section of pro-Kannada organisations on Tuesday asserted they were going ahead with their call to observe a Karnataka Bandh Saturday.The announcement on the 6am-to-6pm bandh comes as exam season is picking up. However, no SSLC exam that begins Friday has been scheduled for Saturday. A schools' association said they would go ahead with exams for lower classes on that day in the interest of students.While a cab drivers' association said they won't ply Saturday, road transport corporation employees said they will take a call in a day or two. Some autorickshaw drivers said they will participate in the bandh.Vatal Nagaraj, leader of pro-Kannada organisations that have called the bandh, said the protest is against the Greater Bengaluru Governance Bill and the atmosphere created in Belagavi region by Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti, where an NWKRTC bus conductor was attacked recently for not speaking in Marathi to a passenger.However, the Kannada Rakshana Vedike faction headed by TA Narayana Gowda said it will stay away from the protest. ""We never believe in protests. Rather we believe in focusing on problems and trying to solve them or fighting for the same. Yes, we're very disappointed with the Belagavi assault and GBG Bill, but we can't really support a full-day protest as it will affecting the earnings of people. So, we are not extending our support to the bandh,"" Gowda explained.But Vatal Nagaraj said: ""We are disappointed with Bengaluru being divided into four to seven parts. We are not going to cancel the bandh. We have support from over 2,000 Kannada activists. People are saying it will affect their livelihood if we have a bandh for one day, but what about things that are affecting us every day? This fight is not for me but for people in the state.""He said other issues of concern include the governor delivering his speech in Hindi, Kannadigas not getting adequate employment in the IT/BT sector, and the increasing influx of outsiders into Bengaluru.N Ashok Kumar, vice-president, Ola Uber Drivers' and Owners' Association, said, ""We fully support the bandh call. We are facing huge losses because of bike taxis. Where should we go for work when outsiders take over our livelihood? No cabs will ply on the road Saturday.""B Jayadev Raje Urs, convener of Joint Action Committee Unions, KSRTC, said, ""We always extend moral support to protests. The Belagavi assault is not at all acceptable, mainly because we are public servants. As of now, we have not really decided to stop bus services. We have to think about public convenience... we will hold a meeting soon and decide.""D Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Managements of Private Unaided Schools in Karnataka, said, ""We want to participate in the protest, but we can only extend moral support as of now due to ongoing exams across the state. Cancelling or postponing them will affect children... which we don't want to happen.""""We are supporting the bandh and our members won't operate that day. All our 20,000 drivers will join the bandh.

"Columbia University bows to federal pressure, agrees to policy changes amid anti-semitism row",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/columbia-university-bows-to-federal-pressure-agrees-to-policy-changes-amid-antisemitism-row/articleshow/119324385.cms,"Columbia University agreed to a series of policy changes after the Trump administration froze $400 million in federal funding over concerns about anti-semitism on campus. These measures include a mask ban, new disciplinary protocols, and granting campus police the authority to make arrests.The Ivy League institution, which had become a focal point for violent anti-Israel protests, announced the reforms in a memo on Friday. It also confirmed the appointment of new leadership to oversee curriculum changes in the Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies department, as well as the Center for Palestine Studies.Among the key measures, 36 campus police officers will now have the power to arrest students or remove them from campus when deemed necessary. Columbia also committed to stricter enforcement of disciplinary policies, including potential suspension, expulsion, or revocation of degrees for students involved in the April 2024 takeover of Hamilton Hall.In a letter to the university community, interim president Katrina Armstrong described the changes as a step toward a safer and more respectful campus but did not directly mention the Jewish student population.“The way Columbia and Columbians have been portrayed is hard to reckon with. We have challenges, yes, but they do not define us,” Armstrong wrote, as quoted by the New York Post.“We are a community of scholars who have deep respect for each other and our mission. We teach the brightest, most creative students in the world, and we care deeply for each and every one of them. I have every faith in our ability to overcome the greatest of challenges. We stand resilient and brilliant.”The Trump administration, which froze the funding on March 7 due to what it described as Columbia’s failure to combat antisemitism, had issued nine demands as conditions for reinstating financial support.While the university has implemented many of these requirements, it has resisted abolishing its university judicial board. Instead, it plans to restructure the panel under the office of the provost, with its five members undergoing a “rigorous vetting and conflict review process.”The university will also appoint a new senior vice provost responsible for reviewing and overseeing the curriculum of the Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies department. This move will result in the removal of Soulayman Kachani from his leadership role, with the new appointee also supervising the hiring process for non-tenured faculty across the university.A controversial mask ban, another demand from the Trump administration, will now be enforced, except for religious or medical exemptions. Protesters on campus will also be required to identify themselves upon request or face disciplinary action. However, the university stopped short of an outright ban on protests inside academic buildings, stating that while such demonstrations are “generally not acceptable,” they will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.Additionally, Columbia pledged to develop a K-12 curriculum aimed at fostering dialogue on difficult topics, including anti-semitism. The university is also reviewing its admissions policies amid concerns over declining Jewish and African American enrollment.Reacting to the developments, U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon defended the administration’s stance.“Since October 7, Jewish students have faced relentless violence, intimidation, and anti-semitic harassment on their campuses—only to be ignored by those who are supposed to protect them,” McMahon said when the funding freeze was first announced.Earlier, Jewish students had reported feeling unsafe on campus due to encampments supporting the Hamas attack on Israel.“Universities must comply with all federal antidiscrimination laws if they are going to receive federal funding. For too long, Columbia has abandoned that obligation to Jewish students studying on its campus. Today, we demonstrate to Columbia and other universities that we will not tolerate their appalling inaction any longer.”Brian Cohen, executive director of Columbia and Barnard’s Hillel chapter, welcomed the intervention and expressed hope that it would prompt the university to address anti-semitism more seriously.“Columbia has an anti-semitism crisis, and for months, I have worked with faculty, staff, students, parents, and alumni to urge the administration to act quickly to address this crisis and avoid lasting damage to the university,” Cohen said.“I hope this federal action is a wake-up call to Columbia’s administration and trustees to take anti-semitism and the harassment of Jewish students and faculty seriously so that these grants can be restored, the vital work of the university can continue, and that Columbia can become, once again, a place where the Jewish community thrives.”","Columbia University agreed to a series of policy changes after the Trump administration froze $400 million in federal funding over concerns about anti- semitism on campus.

Q: Is the public in favor of closing the department?

Q: Who supports Trump’s move?

Q: What’s next?

Trump, surrounded by schoolchildren seated at desks arranged in the White House's East Room, smiled as he held up the signed order during a special ceremony.Since its founding in 1979, the department of education (DoE) has played a pivotal role in administering student loans, supporting students with disabilities and low-income families, and enforcing civil rights in schools. Trump’s action, framed as a bid to return power to the states, reflects long-standing conservative frustration with what they view as federal overreach in education.While Trump cannot legally abolish the department without Congressional approval, the executive order signals his administration’s intent to cripple it through staff reductions and budget cuts. Backed by tech tycoon Elon Musk’s department for government efficiency (DOGE), the effort has already seen nearly half of the DoE’s workforce laid off. The move has thrilled conservative groups like Moms for Liberty but sparked outrage among educators, civil rights advocates, and Democratic lawmakers who warn that it could undermine protections and funding for millions of vulnerable students.Here is all you need to knowA: The order directs education secretary Linda McMahon to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the department of education and return education authority to the states.” While it does not immediately abolish the department—Congress must approve that—it does instruct the administration to scale back operations and staffing.A: Trump argued, “We're going to return education back to the states where it belongs,” calling the federal department unnecessary. He also cited falling test scores and high spending as reasons, saying, “It’s doing us no good.” He believes states can run education systems more efficiently, comparing his goal to countries like “Norway, Denmark, [and] Finland.”A: No. Abolishing a federal agency like the DoE requires an act of Congress. Trump currently lacks the necessary majority to pass such a law. However, he can significantly weaken the department through budget cuts, workforce reductions, and administrative changes.According to White House press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, “The department of education will be much smaller than it is today.” Some “critical functions”—like Pell Grants, student loans, and funding for students with disabilities—are expected to remain. Trump himself said these “useful functions… will be fully preserved.”A: Low-income students, students with disabilities, and students in rural or underfunded districts stand to lose the most. Programs like Title I and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act depend on federal oversight and funding. As Katie Paris of Red Wine and Blue said, “There’s a real opportunity people are going to learn how essential the education department is to access public schools if it’s gone.”A: About 13% of funding for K-12 schools comes from the federal government; the rest is state and locally funded. But that 13% is vital, especially in states that rely heavily on federal dollars—like Mississippi, South Dakota, Montana, and Arkansas.A: Not entirely. Trump claims US students rank “at the bottom of the list,” but data shows otherwise. According to the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), US students are “above average in reading and close to average in math.” Nat Malkus of the conservative American Enterprise Institute added, “The US ranks in the middle of the pack on most international assessments.”A: The department’s critics claim it hasn’t closed achievement gaps. But national data shows that since its founding, fourth-grade math scores have increased by 24 points, and reading scores have held steady. Fernando Reimers of Harvard noted, “In the US only 4 percent of total federal spending is devoted to education,” far less than in many peer countries.A: No. A Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 65% of Americans oppose shuttering the department, with only 30% in support. Democratic pollster John Anzalone argued, “Education is generally popular with voters,” suggesting this could backfire on Trump politically.A: Conservative advocacy groups like Moms for Liberty and the Heritage Foundation strongly back the decision. “It’s a beautiful day to dismantle the Department of Education,” the Heritage Foundation said on X. Moms for Liberty co-founder Tina Descovich added, “I'm very happy about that,” in reference to department cuts.A: Several lawsuits have already been filed. Senator Patty Murray said, “Donald Trump knows perfectly well he can’t abolish the department of education without Congress.” A previous attempt to dismantle the US Agency for International Development was blocked by a federal judge for likely violating the Constitution.While the executive order sets the process in motion, full closure of the department will face Congressional scrutiny, potential legal battles, and continued public debate. As Margaret Spellings, George W Bush’s education secretary, put it: “Donald Trump has called the bluff.” Whether that bluff results in full elimination remains to be seen.(With inputs from agencies)","US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to shut down the department of education.

Becoming a Commonwealth member does not mean accepting the King as head of state

President Donald Trump reacted to The Sun's report that King Charles would make a ""secret offer"" to the president when he visits the UK, for which Prime Minister Keir Starmer had already invited Trump. ""I love King Charles. Sounds good to me,"" Trump reacted on Truth Social triggering a volley of speculations about the secret offer, though The Sun hinted that it would be something to reduce tensions between the White House and Canada.The report said plans are afoot to make the US the next ""associate member"" of the Commonwealth -- a voluntary association of 56 nations, mostly British colonies. Canada is also part of the Commonwealth and as King Charles is one head of state of Canada, it will be his reconciliation plan, the report said.DailyMail quoted a member of the Royal Commonwealth Society who said that the possibility of America making an entry into the Commonwealth is being discussed at the highest levels and is being seen as a wonderful move that would symbolize Britain's close relationship with the US.""Donald Trump loves Britain and has great respect for the Royal Family, so we believe he would see the benefits of this,"" the member said.The US has never been a part of the Commonwealth and the Royal Family thinks including it in the grouping would soothe the tension between Washington and Ottawa. Canada's new prime minister Mark Carney met King Charles this week amid the ongoing US-Canada tariff war.Though the Commonwealth comprises historically British colonies, the grouping aims to work for democracy, human rights, on cultural and economic ties. The most four countries that joined the Common wealth -- Mozambique, Rwanda, Togo and Gabon -- do not have any association with the Crown.

Trump signs order to shut down education dept,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-signs-order-to-shut-down-education-dept/articleshow/119317458.cms,"US president Donald Trump

WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump on Thursday instructed education secretary Linda McMahon to begin shutting down her agency, a task that cannot be completed without congressional approval and sets the stage for a seismic political and legal battle over the federal government's role in the nation's schools.Surrounded by schoolchildren seated at desks in the East Room of White House, Trump signed a long-awaited executive order that he said would begin dismantling the department ""once and for all"". The Trump administration has cited poor test scores as a key justification for the move. ""We're going to shut it down, and shut it down as quickly as possible,"" he said.The department, which manages federal loans for college, tracks student achievement and supports programmes for students with disabilities, was created by an act of Congress. That means, only Congress can shut it down.However, Trump has already taken significant steps that have limited the agency's operations and authority. Since Trump's inauguration, his administration has slashed the department's workforce by more than half and eliminated $600 million in grants. The job cuts hit particularly hard at the department's Office for Civil Rights, which enforces the country's guarantee that all students have an equal opportunity to an education.Trump's order contains potentially contradictory guidance for McMahon. On the one hand, the order directs her to facilitate the elimination of the agency. On the other, she is also mandated to rigorously comply with federal law. The order offers no guidance on how to square those two points.Trump said the department would continue to provide critical functions that are required by law, such as the administration of federal student aid , including loans and grants, as well as funding for special education and districts with high levels of student poverty. The department would also continue civil rights enforcement , White House officials said.","US president Donald Trump has instructed education secretary Linda McMahon to begin shutting down her agency.

Three people have been arrested after Michigan authorities discovered them living in ""deplorable"" conditions with a 9-year-old boy, surrounded by starving, mistreated animals, including a dead puppy stuffed inside a pizza box, officials said.The shocking case unfolded in Flint when AT&T workers reported $30,000 worth of stolen cables from a nearby work site, prompting deputies from the Genesee County sheriff 's office to investigate, sheriff Christopher Swanson said.Upon arrival, deputies were met with a disturbing scene: a dead dog locked inside a cage outside the home. Inside, they found dogs so emaciated that they appeared to have gone without food for weeks—and a horrifying discovery of a puppy's remains inside a pizza box.""You don't treat animals this way,"" Swanson said in a video statement, visibly outraged by the neglect.In addition to the appalling conditions, deputies found a 9-year-old boy living among the filth. Swanson did not specify the child's exact relationship with the three adults but called the situation unacceptable.""Three adults, two dead dogs, two emaciated dogs and a 9-year-old boy,"" he said, calling the case one of severe neglect.The suspects Kelly Walker, 29, Charles Ashbaker, 38, and Douglas Nelson, 47, now face multiple charges.

Release of 1961 plan to break up CIA revives conspiracy theory about who killed JFK,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/release-of-1961-plan-to-break-up-cia-revives-conspiracy-theory-about-who-killed-jfk/articleshow/119317416.cms,"A JFK adviser had proposed giving state dept control of ‘all clandestine activities’ and breaking up CIA

WASHINGTON: A key adviser warned President John F Kennedy after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961 the agency behind it, CIA, had grown too powerful. He proposed giving the state department control of ""all clandestine activities"" and breaking up CIA.The page of special assistant Arthur Schlesinger Jr's memo outlining the proposal was among the newly public material in documents related to Kennedy's assassination released this week. So, too was Schlesinger's statement that 47% political officers in US embassies were controlled by CIA.Some readers view it as evidence of both mistrust between Kennedy and CIA and a reason CIA at least would not make Kennedy's security a high priority ahead of his assassination in Dallas on Nov 22, 1963.That gave fresh attention Thursday to a decades-old theory about who killed JFK - the CIA had a hand in it.Some Kennedy scholars said they haven't yet seen anything in the 63,000 pages of material released under an order from President Trump that undercuts the conclusion Lee Harvey Oswald , a 24-year-old Marine and one-time defector to Soviet Union, was a lone gunman. But they also say they understand why doubters gravitate toward the theory. ""You have this young, charismatic president with so much potential for the future, and on the other side of the scale, you have this 24-year-old waif, Oswald, and it doesn't balance,"" said Gerald Posner, whose book, ""Case Closed,"" details the evidence that Oswald was a lone gunman.Jefferson Morley, editor of JFK Facts blog, said there is still more unreleased material, including 2,400 files FBI said it discovered after Trump issued his order in Jan, and material held by the Kennedy family.Kennedy was killed on a visit to Dallas, when his motorcade was finishing its parade route and shots rang out from Texas School Book Depository building. Police arrested Oswald, who had positioned himself from a sniper's perch on the sixth floor. Two days later, Jack Ruby, a nightclub owner, fatally shot Oswald during a jail transfer broadcast live on television.""It was the first big event that led to a series of events involving conspiracy theories that left Americans believing their govt lies so often they shouldn't pay close attention,"" said Larry Sabato, author of ""The Kennedy Half-Century"".Kennedy had inherited the Bay of Pigs plan from predecessor President Dwight Eisenhower, and had been in office less than three months when the operation launched in April 1961 as a covert invasion to topple Cuban leader Fidel Castro.Schlesinger's 15-page memo ends with a proposal to give control of covert activities to state department and to split CIA into two agencies. Morley sees it as a response to Kennedy's anger over the Bay of Pigs and something Kennedy was seriously contemplating. The plan never came to fruition.Sabato said Kennedy simply ""needed the CIA"" in the Cold War conflict with the Soviet Union and its allies like Cuba, and a huge reorganisation would have hindered intel operations. He added the president and his brother, attorney general Robert F Kennedy, wanted to oust Castro before JFK ran for reelection in 1964. Timothy Naftali, an adjunct professor at Columbia University, discounts the idea of tensions between the president and CIA lasting until Kennedy's death. For one thing, he said, JFK used covert operations ""avidly"".","A key adviser warned President John F Kennedy after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961 the agency behind it, CIA, had grown too powerful.

UK issues new travel advice for citizens going to US

Though Canada has not issued any travel advisory against visiting the United States, Canadian lawmaker Charlie Angus issued a warning against travelling to the US as he claimed that Canadian citizens are being kidnapped by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents. ""We have seen too many stories of citizens being pulled out of airport lines, and being fingerprinted and deported, as if they were criminals. Citizens being kidnapped to illegal detention by ICE…this is not the actions of a Democratic nation,"" New Democratic Party's leader said. While Canada and US have locked horns in a tariff war, the travel warning coincides with the Trump administration's border crackdown.""Canada will never kiss that gangster's ring. We are truth, we are north, we are strong, we are free, we will not bend, and we will not give an inch,"" Angus said in a press conference.Canadian actor Jasmine Mooney who starred in an American Pie video said she was put in chains when she went to renew her visa at the San Ysidro border crossing. She said she was told that she was in the wrong place and that she should have gone to a US consulate. After some to and fro, she was put into ICE custody as she failed to explain to the officers that she was not trying to enter the US illegally. After 12 days of detention, she was finally released and allowed to fly back to Canada.In a massive crackdown on illegal immigrants, the Trump administration has been on an arrest spree. The arrest of two green card holders, Mahmoud Khalil and Badar Khan Suri, created ripples as the administration is planning to deport them.

A huge repatriation drive

Growing worries about deportations

Calls for international help

Zahra Mousavi, a women's rights activist, fled from Afghanistan to neighboring Pakistan in March 2022 after months of fighting and protesting the oppressive Taliban regime She now lives in hiding and constant fear of being apprehended by the Pakistani police and deported to her home country.Mousavi actively participated in street protests against the Taliban regime after the Islamic fundamentalist group seized power in the war-ravaged country in August 2021.She advocated for women's rights by taking part in public gatherings and demonstrations, and tried to make the voices of Afghan women heard in the rest of the world.But with the Taliban slapping broad restrictions on women and girls and gradually squeezing them out of public life, Mousavi was forced to leave.In Pakistan, however, she has struggled to secure the necessary documents to stay in the country.""I could not obtain a valid Pakistani visa for myself and my family due to high costs and Pakistan's strict visa policies,"" the 29-year-old told DW.""This led to my arrest by Pakistani police on February 22. They entered my home in plain clothes, conducted an intense search, and arrested both me and my young daughter, taking us to a deportation detention camp,"" she said.""We were kept there in extremely harsh conditions for two days and one night, and we were only released after providing guarantees and due to the pressure of human rights activists.""DW spoke to several other Afghan female activists, who are also living in hiding as Islamabad looks to accelerate deportations to Afghanistan.Jamila Ahmadi, 27, said many of her fellow Afghan women had already been sent back to Afghanistan and warned that their lives, as well as hers, were in danger.""My activism, especially my efforts toward women's capacity-building before the Taliban takeover, my reporting on Taliban crimes, and my involvement with the National Directorate of Security (NDS), has placed me in significant danger,"" Ahmadi said.""If I am compelled to return to Taliban rule, it would clearly be a certain death.""Many women's rights activists only sought asylum in Pakistan when the situation became untenable in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.""In February 2021, I was attacked, resulting in a broken leg, but my determination remained unshaken,"" said Ahmadi.""Again, in September 2021, we were brutally beaten by the Taliban.""Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for decades.But over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with Afghanistan has deteriorated.Islamabad is angry with the Taliban authorities over the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions escalate, concerns about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan have increased.Islamabad is currently carrying out a huge drive to repatriate the roughly 4 million Afghans who have crossed the border in the past four decades.Pakistan already repatriated more than 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year, according to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).Legal experts and refugee rights activists have criticized the Pakistani government's deportation plans, particularly when it comes to deporting Afghan women's rights activists .""Sending activists back to Afghanistan, where they are very likely to be subjected to torture at the hands of the Taliban regime, would put them in greater risk,"" Osama Malik, a refugee lawyer in Islamabad, told DW.Ahmadi said her health had been affected by the deportation drive.""Unfortunately, for more than a month, the Pakistani police have made life difficult for refugees, including issues with visas and visa extensions. My visa expired on February 25, 2025. My personal, psychological and emotional problems are due to not having a visa and being unable to extend it,"" she said.While rights groups have accused the Pakistani authorities of harassing Afghan refugees, Islamabad has denied the allegations and stressed that the removals were part of a 2023 campaign called the ""Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan.""There ""is no specific category for activists among those being deported,"" a Pakistani official, who asked not to be named, told DW. ""The responsibility of hosting Afghan refugees should not fall solely on Pakistan, as other countries can also accommodate them,"" the official added.Qaiser Khan Afridi, spokesperson for the UNHCR in Pakistan, said the agency was worried about the deportations.""UNHCR is especially concerned for Afghans who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, single women, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians.""""In view of these mounting challenges, UNHCR urged Pakistan to continue to provide safety to Afghans at risk, irrespective of their documentation status,"" said Afridi.Maria Noori, a 34-year-old activist from Kabul facing deportation, called on the international community to intervene and save the lives of Afghan female activists living in fear in Pakistan.""Being sent back to Afghanistan would mean facing torture, imprisonment, or even death. The international community must understand that deporting human rights activists, particularly women, is a direct threat to our lives, and immediate action is needed to protect us,"" she told DW.The lawyer Malik criticized Western governments for their inaction.""It is unfortunate that none of the Western countries have stepped up to immediately allow these female activists to travel to their countries,"" he said.Noori explained that the lack of a legal status and residency documents poses a big challenge. ""Additionally, we face harsh economic conditions, unemployment, lack of access to health care and education, and security threats from extremists.",Afghan women's rights activist Zahra Mousavi fled Afghanistan to Pakistan in March 2022.
